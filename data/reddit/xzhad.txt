how much will a bitcoin be worth then?
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:07:31
that's cheating

I'm biased here, but if you sponsor a dota2 team you get more exposure thanks to the ingame logos and pennants
I see you are already secure with starcraft, but maybe you could expand to dota2 if the exposure of bitcoin is the final goal

maybe 5 is too much, but a TL,DR for those who can't english like me would be appreciated

i trade magic the gathering cards, but i can be trusted with your coins
too soon?

you should totally see all the options before committing the money
as a dota player, all I can say is that dota is driven by the community and it would be easier to find good caster, organization and teams to participate on the tournament. Also the ticket sells gives money back to the organizer or you can choose to boost the prize
that being said, it's absolutely true that lol has more viewers any day on twitch, but... how many of those viewers go to watch community organized tourneys? they are always watching the riot stream or top players streams... i think i've never seen a community tourney on their top streams
pls keep making new threads whenever the idea goes forward to keep us informed
