Thanks that makes sense. Any idea how those brokers like circle and coinbase go about setting their price? Do they gather data on the exchanges and other brokerages to come up with a roundabout price and then possibly account for a small margin of profit? If the answer is more complicated than that I understand, I'm just looking for some clarity and transparency

I think this is a very strong indicator that investors are starting to realize the potential of this protocol and what it could be in the future. This is a high risk high reward investment that I think will turn out well for them

That's a very arbitrary line of you to draw

I think you'll find that 420 is exactly 1 order of magnitude away from both 20 and 1000.

Watch the documentary about wikileaks called "we steal secrets". They show what he has done from an unbiased standpoint. Not saying I don't like the guy, just not everything he's done has been great

Does coinbase have this capability? I'm not seeing where I can set this up. It does seem reasonable though to have this in place.

I am, but I contacted coinbase and because I didn't live in CA when I opened the account, I don't have access to this yet, but they said they were working on changing this this week.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:42:07
Definitely at the top of the bell curve
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:19:21
I also read that somewhere else. I looked in the application support folder and couldn't find a Bitcoin folder. Do I create one?
edit: I found it, and it's in there now, and i've restarted the app and it still didn't recognize. Am I missing something?
