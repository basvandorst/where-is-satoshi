They have been supporting XT, Classic, Unlimited, SegWit2MB, and now SegWit2x for a long time.
They have also clearly signaled they want to replace Core, this is a  concerted attack.

+1 well said, Adam.

Very similar to this:

It wouldn't surprise me that part of their plan is to assume control so they can manage all parameters including supply in the future.

1. Bitcoin valuation column indicates the average of how many days: the last 30 days, last 90 days, and last 180 days.
2. Average TX volume column indicates the average daily TX value for that period.
3. Network value is the BTC market cap at the time of analysis.
4.  NV/T ratio means Network Value divided by average TX volume for that period.

I think this will be the case if the futures market remains favoring BTC 1x. However, I have not doubt they are conducting back door negotiations. So, I think they may subsidize the 2x network for a while speculating they will be able to muscle the network toward B2X (this is why they are using the language "we will support the chain with most accumulated difficulty".)
I gather they think that by putting together their users + mining they could push the ecosystem toward B2x. We shouldn't rest on the futures market.

What do they mean here:
"...on November 16th and will temporarily result in two bitcoin blockchains..."
Isn't the split permanent? Or, are they speculating one of the two chains will die?
If so, calling one or the other BTC may mean nothing, they will just promote B2X and call it BTC eventually. They just want to minimize a Xapo-like controversy.

Yes, they are terrified.

Check coin.dance blocks, 85% miners signaling 2x.

Exactly. They are arbitrarily choosing the "accumulated difficulty" indicator to advance their agenda, not because it is an absolute, or at least sufficient, indicator of security.

Fortunately, they can't be fired!
