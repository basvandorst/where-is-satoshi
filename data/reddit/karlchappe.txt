It is not new, we often organize the paris bitcoin meetup at Sof bar. Im going to organize one in June.

This kind of post makes me sick. You think the average Joe is going to buy some volatile bitcoins to save 5% on his purchase... come on guys!

Great website. I often order indian food with BTC on the french site Pizza.fr

Nice work !

Women, men, Chinese, American, European, we are humans and we are bitcoiners. No need to say "we, as women" or "we, as men". May be it's a European point of view ;-)

You make my day. Well done Sir. Love it!

"JPMorgan threatened to stop providing services even to other banks that had Bitcoin companies as customers — like the European bank working with Bitstamp" 
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:23:15
Don't say to other people what they have to do 
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:08:56
More bitcoins by leverage my position, pay my rent and everything I need as I live on btc.
The most important is not what you can buy with bitcoins or that you can buy things with no intermediaries, but for the first time you own your money even if you have to use an intermediary to buy things.

The vast majority wants centralization to delegate their security.

best advice for most people is certainly to hold, but thinking that the best strategy is to hold because everyone is going to attempt to play the market is weak

try btc-e

boot on TAILS from an USB stick, go to bitaddress, turn wifi off, print with a safe and not connected printer

I don't use banks, only Bitcoin with debit cards and services like cashila. So, YES we can! 
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:05:39
The market will find a way to recover the volatility .. at least until the marketcap stay in this range. And If you don't like volatility and free market, there is FIAT
Edit. That said, it is very bullish for Bitcoin. It is actually very positive for an ETF approval. I doubt the SEC would approve an ETF on BTC with 80% of the trades that are made in China with fake volume ...

Do you understand that stable currency need regulations and central bank to exist. 
Bitcoin is an alternative, free from gov and it can't be the right solution for everybody.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:46:57
So you suggest XT is improving Bitcoin. OP you should go on vacation with Gavin to take some rest.
@_date: 2015-08-06 18:04:33
haha ok I will use brainwallet ;-) or ledger ofc
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:43:23
Right! paperwallet is still the best option and most of the bitcoiners i know use that, including me

OP if you're unsubscribed from r/bitcoin, don't post here.

Focus on adoption is a mistake, we need a strong crypto economy and build more project like OpenBazaar and Augur.  
@_date: 2015-10-02 10:51:19
You dislike price speculation but you said "it won't rise" and made a speculation 
@_date: 2015-10-02 10:25:02
So you don't have any bitcoins...

How many time I've heard this. It's sounds like Gox and LTC.
@_date: 2013-06-19 09:30:24
I'm playing on this site for 6 month and never got a problem. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 16:01:17
Anybody have an idea of the name of this company?
