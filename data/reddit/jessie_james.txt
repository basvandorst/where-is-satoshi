Feature request - I would like to be able to either take a picture of a QR code for my coin address, or perhaps allow the app to read a file or something that has a list of addresses it in.  Typing in an address manually isn't going to happen, as I keep most of my coin info on my desktop computer.

Pretty much - there was no guarantee of transactions processing quickly enough to ensure profit, plus the fees could often make you lose money overall.

That is what I use, yes.
Be sure you DOWNLOAD it and run it locally.  Do NOT create a wallet from the www site, as it may be intercepted (slim chance, but you can never be too safe).

This guy has been around a long time, and it's open source:
He also makes a LTC version.

I did some research on this a while ago, and my conclusion was that it was not worth the time, risk, or effort without some serious computing power (read: custom programming to automate trades).  There are several services out there that will offer the service for you, but ... there are no guarantees, and plenty of risk.

I think it's in an escrow type of account, where it has not been "released" yet.  If I am correct, then that was a smart move by OP.

Sig P238 or P938 is a much nicer shooting gun.

Right, because forcing customers to use an anonymized payment method will surely make it easier for law enforcement to track criminals.
Worlds dumbest cops here, I'm telling you.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:26:34
Yeah, that makes sense.  They'll probably try to ban it or make BC illegal.  Gah.

I would suggest you rethink this.  I have a desktop, laptop, and mobile device.  Many other people will as well.  You should allow activation for up to those three accounts, with one being mobile-only.  If a new device is activated, then deactivate one of the original 3 so only 3 are live at any given time.

BTW, as a fellow programmer, let me remind you of one thing - avoid pissing off your clientele.  Annoying just one person can end up with 100 bad reviews and your project sunk.
Think long and hard about deactivating people.  You may want to come up with a solution that, for example, offers a free limited-feature account for people with 4+ devices (think dashboard only for excessive accounts), a discount for additional accounts, and so forth.
Long term, the best thing for you to do is simply get people on the platform at any cost - and I mean any cost *to you*.  Solicit feedback and ideas from all your users, and build them out but do so with a "subscription" model in mind.  Once you get to the 4-5 year mark of offering this service for free, you can then start to switch specific features to be "Pro" only.  Make it cheap at first, $25/yr or whatever.  
I did that very successfully with my last project.  The first 5 years everything was free, and then I migrated a portion to be ad-free if you paid (that is a simple start), and then added bonus features to paying users.  At one point I was making about $6k - $8k per month by having a $25/yr plan.  
But you HAVE to get a loyal client base first.  You do that by listening to them, tweaking, and making it better than anything else out there.

Verizon blocks outbound port 25, and has done so for 10+ years.

Question - why not store them all locally?  Presuming you have backups, wouldn't that prevent theft?  Why store them with an exchange at all (except to spend them)?
I'm new to this, I apologize for the ignorance.

Interesting, good to know - thanks.
Of course, Vimeo is such a crappy site I avoid it if at all possible ... glad to hear it wasn't you!
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:46:45
Can you please clarify for me - if you store them on your personal computer in a wallet, this theft cannot happen, correct?
Why would people leave bitcoins in an exchange if this is the case?
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:28:47
Even I have seen those threads, so I was trying to avoid ending up like that ... so thank you!  :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:13:44
But what does that mean?  Just more end-users?  And does that mean the price of BTC will go up as a result?  Or the end of the world?  
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:26:21
Yes, I am in the US.  Thanks!

Would you happen to have a link to that?

Disclaimer: I know little to nothing about BitCoins, just started a few days ago.
What I have seen is that in order to purchase BitCoins, you have to connect to a bank account.  You then send money from your bank account to the exchange (like CoinBase), and then you get your BitCoin.  Assuming this is correct, the bank will have a record of that transaction.  If you ever go to court for something like bankruptcy, or perhaps divorce, the court will request a copy of your bank records.  They will then see that you have sent funds to CoinBase.  Assuming the court has a clue that this is money being shuffled to (essentially) an "hidden" type of account (I wanted to use "off shore" but it's not the same), the court will then go after those funds.  It won't be long before the courts will understand that you have a wallet with you BC's in it, and will look for it.
And if you don't have it, they'll jail you for contempt of court or something related to that.  But, of course, that's a HUGE "what if" scenario, which ties into 5th Amendment self-incrimination rights, 4th Amendment search and seizure rights, etc., but that's not the point here.  All I am saying is that *to me, at this time*, it doesn't seem like BitCoins are really anonymous if someone has access to your banking records.  
If it gets to debtors coming after you, and they take you to court, they probably will look at your financial records.  It won't be long for those debtors to find this new hidden source of money and go after it.
Or am I way off base?

This is interesting, but there is ZERO contact information on her site.  No email, address, phone number, contact form, etc.  There isn't even a link to a Facebook page.  
I have to say that lack of information means the site lacks credibility, and I would not order without knowing who or where the company is.  :(
Perhaps you can help her out?

Ah, okay, that makes a little more sense.  What do you think would have to happen for bitcoin to become more stable?  Is it as simple as more use, adaptation, acceptance?  Or ... something else?
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:25:44
Can someone explain this to me?




That is a very good point.  If I accept bitcoins for my business, and I take $100 USD as the equivalent purchase price, and coin values are very high (like the recent $1,000 spike) and then the next day it's only worth $500, that's a big loss.  
Why would any business want to risk that?  It's like accepting stocks for payment, not knowing what they are going to be worth in a day, week, or month.
What am I missing?

What does that mean in term of the big picture?  Anything?  I don't get it ...

Get your parents involved.  This is bull.
Story:  In college, I wrote a paper which basically discussed psychology.
The first paragraph I used a thesaurus to use words which all had three syllables or more.  She marked up the paragraph saying it was good.
The second paragraph I used that thesaurus again, but this time all the words were one or two syllables.  She marked this one up saying it was excellent, clear, made good points, etc.
The third paragraph I explained the difference, and how using complex language makes things more difficult and obscures the truth, and how simple language could help many people.
She wrote "See me".
She gave me an F.
I took the paper to the VP of the college, and he forced her to give me an A.
Today you get to learn how age appropriate it can be to fight back against stupid teachers.

Ok, that makes a lot of sense.  I also had not thought about the selling perspective.  Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:52:14
That's good to know.  Can you provide any more details?  I was thinking about accepting bitcoins for my small business, but the volatility made me not want to do that ...
