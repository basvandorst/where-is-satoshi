LN is a network just like the bitcoin network---the LN transaction is recognised by the network and delivers the Transaction just like bitcoin does. There is no mining, no confirmation activity, no public addresses , 20 hops between sender and receiver, all completely anonymous  . This is a big deal for instantaneous Txs of about 1,000,000 Txs per second---- faster than all credit cards of the world.

Has anyone ever thought about bitcoins effects on the environment?  yes indeed I have and I bring you to the genius of Elon Musk. He has calculated that to supply all the energy needs of the whole USA population he would need a solar collector the size of 100 miles X 100 miles. It would fit in a small corner of Arizona  where it is uninhabited. I have calculated the whole banking system of the USA needs a square 2 X 2 miles and bitcoin only needs 10% of that space. Bitcoin's effect is virtually undetectable in the environment----- now and in the future.

Think of all the different blockchains like a tree trunk, and branches . The genesis block is at the bottom of the trunk and is common to all hard forks  that produced the branches of the tree.

I see what you mean. The network does not care whether it's yours or not. If it is a valid Txs the miners will validate  it  and place it on the blockchain. But your wallet knows you are you and as soon as your Txs hits the blockchain that TXS will appear in your wallet -----nobody else's. Your wallet knows because you have the private key which was created by you when you sent the Txs. In a sense this is completel failsafe and has never failed. If your TXS is lost the network returns a refund to you . (A timeout) 72 hours.

I  have followed Tone Vays with his sequenced trading system which is used by every wall street trader. During the last bear run which lasted 18 months in 2014  he gave the signal to buy right at the bottom. Then was bullish but missed the top at $20,000 and was caught in a bull trap in March 2018 . Since then he has been bearish every week and has his next down target to be 5000,. If reached his next target is 3000 sometime Oct/Nov and if reached his next target is 1,300. So the bears will have it thru to 2019 March. Then a bull run to 20,000 up to 100,000.  All this being said, all his targets are provisional upon a reversal at any time but he will recognise it and will tell us as he sees it. A bear run is a bear run until iy isn't. Get some upside with the Tone. He is on Utube everyday and goes to all international conventions.

I think you are looking for a level of security that does not exist. The only problem to solve is to secure your server with firewalls. Once that is done you transfer from hot to cold wallets. The cold wallet must be off line and also secured.  " change address " system is hot and insecure.

The 51% refers to the centralization of the hashing power by miners not specific countries. A cabal with 51% of the hashing power could be world wide.

The code has never been hacked--running 24/7 for 7 years--no crashes (because everything is out in the public ).

The other consideration by Satoshi was that each BTC is effectively infinitely divisible by the fact that each Satoshi is also divisible----so, the 21Million is the rounding solution pointed out by 5tu ----it could have been any other number.   This 21Million also makes the point that the USA debt of 18Trillion could be revalued any time to 18 dollars or any other convenient number---it is only a number and is not your debt anyway.    
@_date: 2015-08-06 06:49:29
$200M for 3Billion people( Who use cash each day) works out to 7 cents a day.When BTC halves next year it will be 10 cents per day. So both BTC and gold have similar operating costs at the current time.

The short answer is no one knows YET. The world has never seen a free market in action with free supply and demand forces at work.

You may be referencing the 6 weird blocks which were orphaned. This whole event was corrected by the blockchain and no rightful  transactions were at risk.

@_date: 2016-02-03 07:48:47
SW is proposed code and a better name for it is SEPARATED SIGNATURE. Each transaction has a validation signature which becomes redundant as soon as the block is included in the chain. This redundancy takes up a lot of space so SW is an improvement in the protocol , freeing up to 75% of block space. More transactions can fit in a block with the SW soft fork---very good.

Although the miners are losing money and burning through cash , they are still getting the bitcoin reward which is not enough to cover all there expenses. They are hoping other miners drop out of the reward game before they are forced to. It is a balancing game of managing losses----Like GM closing 15 factories instead  of all factories.

Ensure you backup the wallet onto a usb stick. Even if your node goes down you can recover it later by re- syncing.

There is no such thing as a "first node" connection.

The cost of a  double spend  is about 5 Million nowadays and the spender has control of the network for 10 minutes. If detected by nodes in the next block the network automatically forks and leaves the spender in the shorter chain unable to transact, losing all his coins . The miner will be identified and tattooed internally  on  a spit, equipment ceased and dumped into an ocean by a band of maximalists. Besides the time will run out if 6 confirmations are required by any exchanges before withdrawals are conducted.

I fell into the same trap that you have. If you buy $100 of BTC and Btc goes up 10 % , you gain $10 . If you buy $100 of LTC and it goes up 10% , you gain $10 . NO difference at all. So the question to be asked is " which coin has the biggest percentage gain"----buy that, and compare risk factors between coins.

Tax law deems that person A sold the BTC for cash----No tax, unless you are a currency trader or speculator. If you bought BTC 5 years ago for $5 and now worth $50,000,000----No tax because it is a windfall not an investment.

Not that I am aware of. Your strategy therefore is go in, trade, and then out. But your funds can be subjected to freezing or lost at any time. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:13:09
Why do that-------run copay and just send the balance  to another wallet of your choice.
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:55:58
Connect Armory to the internet first----your balance should show up and everybody will be smiles. Armory records all your transactions even if you are offline. Armory does not record the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:04:00
Your hardware and software cannot be given implicit trust. That said you can trust the blockchain to record your transaction and you can check the transaction on the chain. So ---all your bitcoin should be offline in paper wallets and their balances can be verified on the chain. When you transact , you can test a small amount first and check the chain to verify completeness, The only thing you can trust is the chain and it is the first time in human history something can be trusted because trust has been eliminated,

The small test amount is from a wallet with only a small amount in it. It cannot be changed to a large amount. 
  This will give you assurance but I  do see your point--- you maybe still under the control of a hacker and still at risk. The game is up and you have lost all your coins I'm afraid.

Print off a BTC paper wallet from Bitcoinaddress.org. Then send BTC from coinbase to paper wallet. You then have all the keys---private and public and you are then in full control of your funds. Practice with small amounts and learn about paper wallets (utube)

Use a different address for the next paper wallet.

Third option is he burnt them deliberately----he knew how to do it and described use cases for burning. When Satoshi burnt them he pretty well owned 100% of the coins . And this is the principal reason that they were burnt----Satoshi knew they had to be destroyed so that bitcoin could be viable when bitcoin was released into the wild. Destruction ensured scarcity and value to the eco system. Bitcoin would have been a toy without the destruction. With destruction the phoenix arises.

Intrinsic value also because it is protected and nurtured by a code openly known intimately by 100 to 200 persons on earth. Only the best coding minds know bitcoin ----- that has value. So we have a lot of reasons that make Bitcoin digital gold based on esoteric values. Gold on the other hand is a bit different ---and I believe it is based on intrinsic value deep in our DNA. It is heavy,yellow, shiny, malleable,unusual, rare etc, etc. These gem qualities are valued by birds, mammals and humans for tokens of affection and decoration------another esoteric arena. Hence the connection with digital gold.

To explain the first principles : your coins in Coinbase are to be sent to your Trezor. All sending is done through PUBLIC keys which can be seen by the world on the public blockchain. Your wallets generate the public keys (address) when you send the coins or receive them.

Have you heard of Zero confirmations? You must evaluate risk of fast confirmations versus risk of lost customers---- are you risking your business?

The beauty of bitcoin is that is designed to be a political basket case---it is through all this game theory mastication that consensus is arrived at. All the fighting forces users and abusers to think of their wallets and ethics to act  finally one way or the other. Bitcoin is the first open source currency and store of value ever to exist and the inner fighting strengthens the system. The system does not bow down to anybody, dictator, cabal, group or collusion ,corruption
-----------it is code and allows politics , spamming, freedom of choice, innovation, and finally is a work of wonder the world has never seen. Enjoy it my friend!

Because you have 20,000 to lose, do your due diligence. Watch utube's TONE Vays---wall street analyst, daily BTC forecasts, Follow for 2 weeks with imaginary 20,000 and his advice---to see if you can stand the heat. BTC was 1000  4 months ago, now 2600 -3000 all time highs , forecast for future 2 months is 3000--5000. India, Korea Japan and china have given the nod recently to BTC. The recent SEGWIT upgrade to the code bodes well. Good Luck and think LONG.

I remember some British university analytics pegged the average wallet having 2 BTC----which makes sense with 6 million HODLERS giving 12Million +2 for Satoshi and whales with 2 = Total of 16 Million. Based on this I guess heavily invested would be a "bitcoin millionaire" with 21 coins ( 1/21,000,000 ).

The market data on exchanges is the best data there is for volume and price. But bitcoin's best use case is about 98% speculation so that muddies the waters. The only good article I know of is Tone Vays (wall street analyst) on his web site Liberty Life Trails.

Your BTC is stored on the blockchain----not in your wallet.Your wallet has the keys to the coins shown on the PUBLIC blockchain . The blockchain is being verified all the time by 1000's of computers every second since 2009.Even if you loose your wallet the coins can be recovered because they still exist on the blockchain.

Everything uses servers except decentralised Bitcoin Core Wallet---that is what I use-----but you need at least 200 gig free space on a computer and 5 days to download it.

Simple answer---As soon as price goes up, miners profits go up and new miners join the energy burning, profits go down and new miner rate goes down. Miners get 1 million per day so will increase to $3m. A whole lot of new energy is going to be burned--3x.

The only files you need to store on a usb are the wallet backup files( the .DAT files) . All your other files can be lost. Buy another computer,download Core, import your DAT file. Never delete dat files.

The BGP is a basic message problem---I am the king and send an order out. Did it get through, was it understood, why have we not heard back, has my enemy got the message now, can we now attack etc etc. Satoshi solved the problem by broadcasting the message to the whole world through the blockchain (public keys) and the secret private key to the general. When the general uses that key the blockchain broadcasts a spent amount to the whole world and I know you got my message. Something like that, a bit more involved----empires had never solved it before Crypto.

Alot of people have held their coins for a long time 2-3 years---( 2 years )--Long in bitcoin time is 6--12 months----things are rapidly evolving---longer is better but evaluate cashing out part profits every 6-12 months ( Tone has different position on this ) . He has an escape strategy. This bitcoin thing is fascinating.

The best storage is one where you control your PRIVATE keys----paper or hardware wallets are good or you can run a node/ bitccoin wallet. Anything or anyone can lose your keys if you don't. You can also just cross your fingers and hope for the best-----I hope the price in future years does not encourage people with your keys to just run away. Mt.Gox.

The size was unlimited to begin with------people began clogging up the system with spam----satoshi cut the size to 1 Meg---and said to would do for 6/7 years, then another increase would be needed----but then came ASIC and the miners rule the henhouse.

All old addresses are readable going forward after segwit activation----but that does not say that all web software is compliant ater the activation so that caution is needed around the August 1st date.

Tone Vays (expert)---(utube) has your destiny for those coins. He consults for .1 BTC per hour-----check out his vids. My bet is he will tell you to do NOTHING, but will protect your coins from yourself with finesse, in a way that you will never have thought of.

Your BTC is safe and can be recovered even if you lose your ledger hardware. Segwit is a thing and there have been no split in the last year---you are thinking about BCH which has nothing to do with BTC.
