It’s actually an original piece from u/Plugdin! 
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:25:41
The lighting doesn’t really do it justice here, but it looks awesome. Also u/Plugdin provides great customer service and prompt delivery. It’s a reminder of how great the bitcoin and reddit community can be. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:00:26
How much for the original? DM me

Is it possible that they aren’t liquid/solvent because of the increase in the price of bitcoin and that’s why they are doing this? I hope these fuckers get audited. Like, if everybody wanted to withdraw the value of their bitcoin I doubt they would have it.

You never pay capital gains if you never sell. The only tax I intend to pay with my bitcoin is sales tax.

It’s a Michael Scott quote. 
The joke is that it’s obvious in the movie who Spartacus is (he is the star, Kirk Douglas), but there is a scene where all his men say “I’m Spartacus” in response to the Romans looking for him, so basically they all volunteer to be killed. In History, they were all crucified along the apian way I think.

Sell at a loss. Always a good idea. First chapter of any investing book. 
Buy high 
Panic 
Sell low 
Repeat until you are broke
Seriously don’t buy unless you understand the tech and the market. This is going to be a wild ride, but if it goes to 1k tomorrow I’ll be a fucking multimillionaire by 2023 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:07:54
Fingers crossed. Ima buy the fuck out of it. If it goes anywhere even close to $500. I’d be thrilled if it went back to $5000

On selling out now: 
Hahaha...The fuck is that? I’ll tell you what it is. It’s me taking no for an answer. It’s them selling me, not the other way around. It’s me being a hypocrite is what it is. So you know what? I’m not leaving. I’m not leaving. I’m not fucking leaving! The show goes on! This is my home! They’re gonna need a fucking wrecking ball to take me out of here. They’re gonna need to send in the national guard, a fucking SWAT team, cuz I ain’t going nowhere!!! FUCK them!!

I like you. 
There can only be one form of digital gold! 
Thank you though, Satoshi, for the Reddit gold. 
Anybody who is anonymous from now on should be called satoshi. Instead of saying an anonymous person tipped the police, just say a satoshi tipped the police and so on. 
So, thanks satoshi.

There are too many pillows on some peoples beds. It’s like, there is no way you are possibly using all of those. are you sleeping with Cerberus? Where do you put the pillows when you end up not using them? Do you put them at the end of the bed? You know they are just going to fall off and then they are on the floor. Who wants a floor pillow? For that matter who wants a pillow shaped like a cylinder or one with 5 buttons, 4 tassels and ridges running through it like an X and stuffed like a goose? Nobody’s sleeping on that. It’s a pillow for your eyes and they don’t even look that great.

It's like the end of Spartacus. I have seen that movie half a dozen times and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is and that, is a classic who-done-it.

True Detective. Quote is out of context. Great show on HBO.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:33:02
That’s alright with me.
I’m a political believer. It’s not all about money for me. If bitcoin went to $250k tomorrow I wouldn’t sell.

You can send bitcoin via mail by writing your private key down in a code in a letter or your mnemonic phrase for that matter or even send it by ham radio. You can even record yourself saying your private key put that on an SD card or hide it in an image on a home video that’s 4 hours long. Hell you can just remember your key or mnemonic phrase and have mental bitcoin until you go abroad and recover it. 
There is no currency or store of wealth more impossible to contain than bitcoin.

You can send bitcoin out of the country in a lot of ways China cant track. Actually, bitcoin is by definition globally available to whoever has the private key. 
However, spending the bitcoin elsewhere could get you in trouble. A lot of public addresses are likely flagged as foreign or as addresses that indicate capital flight. Such as a bitcoin atm address. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:59:11
I knew this was coming! 
I had a friend who talked down to me about buying bitcoin in the first place make the argument that “there is a lot of evidence Wall Street is setting it up to short it when futures trading opens” and he based this argument on nothing other than being wrong this whole time. 
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta.

Plot twist: The bitcoin project died sometime before Hal Finney stopped working on it under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakomoto due to his disease. Maybe some problem hadn’t been solved and people lost interest or whatever. Fast forward to Hal being re-animated and cured of his ALS in the future. His kids and wife are dead and he sees how fiat has collapsed the global economy. Hal decides not only to perfect bitcoin but finds a way to communicate with the past through the internet. Satoshi is actually a re-animated Hal Finney from the future who invented bitcoin and sent it back in time through the internet to save the world from the bankers and so that his kids/wife could have it and thus have enough money to live long enough to be with him in the future or also cryogenically freeze themselves and achieve the same.

The key would be to run it in an apartment building with a common power source. Then either pay off the building owner or cut him in on the deal or just buy the building yourself and do it that way. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:48:40
Most Venezuelan customs guys wouldn’t even know what one was. Incorporate it into a $150 microwave or something and they won’t spot it. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:44:32
Wow. No sources or any evidence of wtf you are talking about
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:22:01
Yeah, I’m not saying it’s easy. It’s something to think about though. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:03:59
There’s food. Just not enough of it. Plus, you only need to bring like a dozen or so in. Pretty easy to explain that.

It will get rejected by the rest of the nodes.

Why do we have markets specifically for bulls and bears? And why can’t we keep them separated. Shouldn’t these people sell either bulls or bears? For that matter, why are they selling bears?

It was a .22 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:53:17
It’s doable. Venezuela has a thriving black market because anyone can be bribed.

Yawn. I’m not afraid. Don’t need to justify it.
