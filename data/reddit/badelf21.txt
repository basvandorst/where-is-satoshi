You can get a good feel for the person he is by reading his reddit submissions: 
According to his story, it sounds like the guy may have started out great in life, got himself a Ph.D. and worked hard enough to not have any debts. But then kinda... gave up. Maybe his life turned out harder or less happy than he wanted and he gradually got more and more disgusted by the world and its problems. Whatever his demons were bitcoin was a smaller one. He was planning his suicide for a couple of years at least and just got into bitcoin in the intervening period. Maybe he was looking for a way out. Like if he made a million dollars on bitcoin he would reset the clock on his suicide and try life again. One of his first submissions clearly states something like "If i had a million dollars, i'd enjoy the fuck out of that."
But he didn't make it. And in the end he saw his failure not as a random shitting on by market, but as a personal flaw in himself. So he blamed himself and decided HE was the problem.
It's classic depression, such people eventually stop hating the world and turn inward. They grow to hate themselves so much that it drives them to murder... of themselves.

Yeah that's the insidious thing about depression. At the very end, you get locked up in "negative loop" as you call it. Even if someone comes along and hands you a billion dollars on the back of hooker sucking your dick you're so entrapped by the loop that your first thought is: "This must be some fucking trick. There are probably hidden cameras and you're all here to laugh at me. That money is probably fake."
Even when something good happens, you're so accustomed to thinking only bad things happen to you that the good thing has to be a trick. So you reject even the good things. It's cynicism times a billion.
Anyway, like i said before, bitcoin seems to be the smaller of his issues. He seemed to only get into it this year. Who knows what happened to him before to make him reject all offers of help. But he was likely already long gone in his mind before you guys got to him, no one's fault.
BTW, how did you guys catch on? other than his username, which frankly seems like a vanity account, he doesn't seem to mention being suicidal in bitcoinmarkets. He just talks about in and that's it.

Yeah if he said don't worry then he was pretty much set. He was just sticking around to see the sights before he would take off. Of course we should always try to help such people, but we shouldn't blame ourselves for being unable to save someone who was essentially terminal.

If i buy some bitcoins today, and then a hard fork is created a few months from now. Do my bitcoins become invalid? or unspendable? should i wait until after the hard fork to buy bitcoins?

Is it safe to encrypt the wallet and put it online? I want to access my coins in case my house burns down or something. But at the same time i don't want someone to steal it.

To the core!
@_date: 2014-10-01 01:18:53
By all means make it!
@_date: 2014-09-30 23:20:11
Oh i see. Thank you very much for explaining it to me! :)

Ah ok, now i see the need to opensource the bootloader. Make sense. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:53:39
Could we write our own opensource bootloader and put that into the trezor? Or do we HAVE to opensource the original bootloader? Like would the trezor hardware reject another bootloader?
Is writing a bootloader hard?
Sorry i'm not a programmer so i have no idea if what i'm saying makes sense.

Yeah its sad. He seemed to know more about their trading engine than they did. 
I'm wondering if he was tipped a bit, and felt *needed* in the world, he might have hung on. BFX didn't have to bail his gambling ass out, but it might have been nice just to send a BTC or two his way to show that the world does appreciate talent and hard work. 
I guess we'll never know now. RIP
@_date: 2014-09-30 23:03:12
So can other programmers write their own? or do we have to use the original?
Unlike other important pieces of tech, i think in this case we don't HAVE to demand the original trezor bootloader is opensource if we can write our own opensource bootloader and load it in. Just like how i don't really care if microsoft opensources windows because we can just use linux if we want, on the same hardware.

What are some ways to participate and benefit from bitcoin if you don't have money to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:49:56
but i'm still looking for ways to participate and benefit without holding/buying bitcoin. Price volatility is too much for a guy like me that lives paycheck to paycheck.

meanwhile, people like bitcoinidiotdude who reported on exploits in the BFX swap system got nothing.

thanks, i'll check into the jobs!
