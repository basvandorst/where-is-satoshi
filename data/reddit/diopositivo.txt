You can mitigate the reversal risk by making a number of smaller transactions over a couple of days.

the current segwit implementation breaks asicboost. They might be thinking on a different implementation and that is why they need a hard fork
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:41:38


AFAIK Blockstream didn't patent Lightning. Anyone can be a LN node and I would argue that large miner pools are in very good position for that being able to process initial fund-blocking transactions fast and free.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:45:58
Why I am a core supporter:
- I want 2-way pegs for rootstock and LN and for that we need to fix malleability bug. 
- I want ASICBoost disabled because is a patented technology and clearly a bug in Satoshi block structure implementation. I could tolerate it if it was not patented.
- I want to optimize the time it takes to check transactions because not doing that encourages miners trusting other miners to check validity of the blocks. 
- I want small blocks because it takes time to propagate them and the longer the block the more possibility of a collision (two miners broadcasting the solution at the same time) and the miner that is more network-isolated will always lose, that might create a geographically concentration of miners.
I also think Core programmers are the best programmers in the crypto space

Not a problem but block header structure should be used to the best benefit of the network

It does not matter what I hate. We were talking about Jihan cornering the hashpower market using patents.

chip foundries usually check for patent infringement and I've heard they refuse the make chips with patented IP
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:07:57
oh please, the advantage is based on a quirk of the initial bitcoin design, leaves a part of the most valuable real state (the block header) unusable for other uses. Not to mention that they patented the technology. Asicboost must DIE
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:35:37
I still think Bitmain opposes segwit because it (unadvertently) blocks their patented AsicBoost technology.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:16:22
why all the people on the picutiures look westerners?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:42:14
How the direct evidence you want would look like?  I would say: 
- Refuse to signal ANY protocol change that modifies the freaking bytes they use for AB.
- Create convoluted ways of achieving similar results as Segwit but that are compatible with the AB bug.
- Refuse to give up on patents
- Buy Sergio Lerner 
Anything else?
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:52:11
- Blocks the use of patented ASICBoost technology. The problem of this optimization is that is patented: i.e. owners will call daddy nation-state to punish the miners that want to use it. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:25:33
Using "the patent system" to gain a mining advantage is against Bitcoin in my book. It is a bug just as malleability. We should give them the chance of open source  the patent or fork bitcoin to make it unusable.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:43:34
exactly like there are millions of DNS protocols !
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:16:14
This stability is not normal. I speculate The Bitcoin Powers that Be are manipulating the price to make it stable for long periods of time using almost-endless resources of bitcoin and fiat. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:11:25
I don't follow you.  Please agree/disagree on these facts:
1 - No blocks were generated with open (not-covert) AB
2 - There is no way of telling if a block was generated with covert AB
3 - AB provides a hashing speed advantage ~20%
4 - AB is a patented technology and ASIC manufacturers (foundries) refuse to make chips with patented IP without permission from the IP owner
5 - Antminer has implemented AB in their latest ASICs
I speculate that Antpool is not using open AB to avoid a "public relations" problem. Same reason why they didn't publicize that rhey put AB in their ASICs

I think the value proposition of Bitcoin is not to replace cash for a more convenient form but to become a reserve currency independent from the well-being of any nation-state. If it is not bitcoin it will be something else, but inflationary currencies will die when one powerful enough stable/deflationary currency appears, there is no way around it.
These two possibilities are orders of magnitude apart in terms of valuation of bitcoin in the future. Reserve currencies is for "stock" cash is for "flows". I'm ok to leave flows to 3rd parties such as "bitcoin banks"  
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:06:38
- I already recover and cashed out my initial investment. I stay here not only to make money.
- Satoshi disappearance 
- Slightly deflationary. Fixed 21M limit. 
- Reserve currency to challenge nation states manipulation of economic cycles.
- Very hard to modify 
- supports reserve currency qualities onchain + transactional flows at lower security
- Core has the best programmers 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:28:26
understood, you want more transactions and Segwit might not be the solution. But segwit is not only that. Why are you opposed to segwit again?

Endgame is all taxes will be on property/natural resources/licenses/permits . They will have a hard time (i.e. rely on honest citizens that will be decimated by cheaters) taxing personal work if crypto becomes mainstream.

Fact 1: Segwit (Core version, tested and deployed) is incompatible with ASICBOOST
Speculation: Obviously Garzic is trying to implement a new segwit version that is compatible with ASICBOOST

This is just a phase. As SHA256 is a very simple algorithm, bitcoin mining chips should become cheaper, think of calculators in 1980's and now.  POW will be a cheap energy game and energy is a much more distributed resource.
Patented AsicBoost technology is one of the things that will yield more centralization in the future and that's why we need to eliminate it

But these "issues" also need to be fixed: malleability is clearly a problem, covert asicboost is a problem, separate signatures is a performance enhancement.  
Stalling on these obvious fixes makes me think there are other motives.

Maybe Silbert didn't want to step on anyone's toes and get a general commitment to *something* and left the details to be discussed later. Like presidents shaking hands in agreement on "climate change" or " commercial treaty" and then technical teams of both countries trying to make sense of the nonsense they signed
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:38:00
you fail to realize that in order to make an ASIC you need to send the design to a chip foundry. There are only a few of them in the world and AFAIK they refuse to produce chips with patent infrigements, so you might be wrong
