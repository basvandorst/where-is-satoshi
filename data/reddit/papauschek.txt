I published the source code and some documentation here:
Let me know if there are any questions.

Cointape creator here. I'm thankful for all the good feedback I received for the site here on Reddit and elsewhere, but, as the OP said, running Bitcoin Core and the site on my server consumed too much traffic and resources.
I'm willing to put the whole code on GitHub, if someone else wants to host it. Of course I'm also willing to answer any questions about the code. The backend is written in Scala / Playframework and uses PostgreSQL to store some of the recent block statistics. The (tiny) frontend is done with ReactJS + Bootstrap.
I'm gonna clean up the code a little and post the GitHub link as soon as I uploaded it.

Original author of the tool here. There is nothing wrong with it. Hosting this service is neither free nor trivial with the current traffic. If 21inc did not offer to host the service, it would probably not be live today, and no one on Reddit would be able to complain about it ;)
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:09:39
there is now a dedicated API available, see 
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:33:37
done =)
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:03:44
A first API is now available, documented here: 
Feedback welcome :)

I wanted to keep the fee recommendations a bit hidden until the predictions have a proven track record. The next step will be to backtest the predictions and provide a "prediction success" analysis for everyone to observe.
If the accuracy is high enough I will then move on to make the recommendations more prominent.
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:49:05
I was definitely thinking of providing an API for developers, actually if you reverse engineer it you see the data is already served in JSON format (  )
If there is enough interest, I will definitely consider open sourcing it. However at this point, I'm not yet sure if it's worth the effort (documentation, etc.)
@_date: 2015-07-27 08:45:22
thanks for the feedback
I'm not sure I fully understand your idea. You would plot for each fee bin, the ratio between confirmed and unconfirmed transactions for the whole day?
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:50:33
Not yet, if there is enough interest I might put it on GitHub. It's a ReactJS / Bootstrap frontend and a Scala / Play Framework backend.
@_date: 2015-07-27 08:41:37
at the moment I'm storing the blocks of the last 24 hours to make the calculations (around 150 blocks).
the main reason you can't do the predictions on the client side / JS is because monte carlo simulations are computationally very expensive. the predictions currently take 20 seconds to update, as it simulates 1000 scenarios of predicted transactions (around 100000 transactions per day currently)
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:25:02
Yes, priority is an input factor too, which is currently excluded from the simulation. It remains to be analysed how many miners are actually following that rule. Any ideas how to get this data easily?
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:01:21
Unfortunately you're right, at the moment. The user shouldn't actually have to deal with this. Most wallets currently do not base the transaction fee on the transaction size, but eventually they will have to.
And when they do, wallets don't have to bother the user with fees anymore, instead they can bother them with expected confirmation times ;-)
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:57:00
feedback highly appreciated :)
also, does someone know how bitcoin core calculates the confirmation times?
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:53:15
Frontend: ReactJS / Bootstrap
Backend: Scala / Play Framework / PostgreSQL
The backend actually stores the blocks and transactions. Data is currently pulled from the Blockchain.info API. I considered Chain.com but they don't provide the transaction sizes, which are essential for the calculations here.
If there are Scala devs interested, I will consider open sourcing the whole thing.
@_date: 2015-07-27 08:44:02
definitely thinking about doing that :)
also, I'm thinking about doing a retrospective on the predictions, to see how well the predictions actually perform.
@_date: 2015-07-25 15:26:08
I see. I guess it makes sense to reduce the noise a bit and make only an hourly update. Currently, the predictions are updated every 10 minutes. 
However, an hourly update means the predictions will lag behind if someone floods the network with transactions.
Not sure which is better
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:18:20
Point taken. On the top of the FAQ section there is now a recommended fee that uses the average transaction size as a basis.
However in the future, wallets should do this for you.
@_date: 2015-07-27 06:43:06
Good to know. Will try to keep the api stable then ;-)
@_date: 2015-07-25 15:11:49
thanks for the comments!
You're right about the time estimate, I changed the wording to 5-15 min.


Maybe the visualization is a bit confusing. The predictions are actually quite stable. What's changing often is the mempool, of course, because it is currently cleared after each block is mined.
Or did you mean something else?
@_date: 2015-07-25 15:43:58
Hi, thanks for the feedback!
There was a problem with the responsiveness of the page, it's fixed now and should work fine on all screen sizes.
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:19:22
I've tweaked the algorithm to produce more stable outputs, while still being able to react fast to the current mempool situation
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:18:56
Which is why I built cointape.com
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:49:55
Hi, thanks for the detailed statistics about expected block times.
It will be also interesting for me to see how well it predicts when there are more transactions in the backlog. Let me give you a few details about the prediction, maybe you have some interesting inputs.
The monte carlo simulation currently makes the following assumptions:
* Miners will pick as many transactions as possible, taking the ones with highest satoshis/byte first.
* Some blocks will be empty (probability is taken from last 24 hours)
* In the next 3 hours, people will add transactions that are similar to the last 3 hours.
* After those 3 hours, people will add transactions similar to the last 7 days.
The simulation currently simulates only one day into the future, and samples 1000 different outcomes. Then, the prediction algorithm tests each transaction fee and how fast it confirms in each of the simulations.
Any thoughts for improvement?
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:00:20
Since you want to deal with whole numbers only, satoshis make more sense here. The lowest transaction fee / byte shown on the page is 10 satoshis per byte, which is 0.1 bits / byte. 
"bits per byte" would be a very weird unit :D
@_date: 2015-07-28 17:07:43
Thanks :-)
