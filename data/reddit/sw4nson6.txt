when i first learned about bitcoins it was the time people who bought bitcoins at $260 ATH they are called n00bs for buying at such high price. current price was $90 per bitcoin. and the same story goes with litecoin. people who bought $7 ath and the current price was $1.5. i remember some people who bought at $7 a litecoin sold their stash at sub $2 with a loss. and you know the rest of the story that bitcoin to $1100 and litecoin to $48.
i think history will repeat. keep holding. and buy more to lower your average buyin price.

you can generate new private keys without even touching any online web wallets btw.
download it to your computer, run it offline and generate a new private key &amp; address pair. send your coins to the new address/ save your new private key.
this is an easy process, you no need any online wallet.

Ethereum is just another premined, ipo coin. I see litecoin has a huge advantage after bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-09 08:21:14
stop using online wallets then!
it is the bitcoin's core feature. be your own bank idiots! download the bitcoin QT!

if you have a private key on the paper. then you no need anything else but a private key. so you can delete your blockchain. since you backed up your private key with a printed paper.

You should learn what sarcasm is...
Buttcoiners always say bitcoin is dead when some bad shit happens.

Charlie Lee is the reason why I like Litecoin that much!
