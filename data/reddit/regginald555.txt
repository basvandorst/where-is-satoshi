'The bug only existed about 3 weeks'
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:31:04
Ditto! Transferred a small percentage of my holdings and ran a 'dummy' wipe and recover test.. very impressed!
Edit: This got me thinking.. do they have a referral scheme? Turns out they do!
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:34:53
I can understand the skepticism, but he did explain the situation in response to ver's tweet - have you seen the full thread?
I suppose it boils down to how much you trust a stranger to tell the truth..
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:24:29
Yeah it's a real bastard haha!
If you have friends that are in the crypto space, don't forget Ledger's referral: 
I plan on purchasing a second device once my investment grows, if you sign up ping me your link in a pm and I'll help a brother out :) 
Unfortunately my friends aren't convinced yet (I'm trying!)
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:39:01
I think all crypto heads should do this.
Vires in numeris!
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:21:24
Second this.. only order direct, even 'approved resellers' comes at a risk.
Delivery took over 6 days, but I'm very pleased with the device.
P.s. Don't sh*t your pants when you transfer your coins to the ledger if they don't show up immediately. Mine took around 4-5 hours.

No need to apologise, everyone makes mistakes. Just be thankful it was only $100, and not 100BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:09:26
It's nonsense because the goalposts move so much? Never heard such drivel.
I work in a tech related industry so I understand how quickly things can move, especially in terms of protocols - that hasn't stopped me from studying blockchain, and as bitcoin is the frontrunner, it's only natural for us late to the party to get involved. 
I stand by my sentiment that if bitcoin fails and another protocol takes the throne and I lose my investment, then it's no big deal. I've helped fund the R&amp;D of future tech that has HUGE implications on society in general.
You sound bitter, but I'm struggling to understand why.. 
Why are you so negative my dude?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:31:11
Oh I agree the values are slightly out, if I was the author though I'd explain it that a lot of coins were lost during the global crisis. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:12:52
No problem! 
Have any queries getting it set up or testing recovery, feel free to ping me a message.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:26:54
Yes, and no.
While it does suffer the same flaw in regards to someone discovering your seed (we won't be moving away from this for a while), electrum is open to additional vulnerabilities in regards to the underlying O/S it's installed on.
Larger surface attack vector = higher probability of being attacked.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:55:54
Fellow newbie here.. have you checked if any bitcoin ATM's exist in or near to your geographical location?
Check out: 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:01:31
Ah that's unfortunate. 
No problem, always worth checking if you are ever out of town.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:07:24
Awesome.. I pictured the city in Dawn of the dead when they described Citadels!
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:37:16
No worries.. 15% is very good, considering it's paid in BTC and not fiat!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:12:35
The look on his face approaching the second hit haha.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:10:13
5 days, including one day that DHL cocked up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:52:07
Agreed! Come to think of it, that is the perfect cover story..
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:33:36
Futurama and BTC?! I'm in
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:15:55
Yeah that sounded better in my head..
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:59:09
Has anyone recommended  yet? I've heard multiple stories of how good this guy is..
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:52:09
I blame our media to be honest. Shit c*nts, the lot of them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:25:07
He is our spiritual leader.. how dare you!
But seriously, I can't fathom why you would think this? What does he have to gain?
I can only think of the negatives.. making himself a target for hacking, physical abuse to surrender his keys/seed etc.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:34:08
Sign me up!
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:35:10
Ever thought some of us are interested and believe in the tech and would also like to see some return on our investment, whether that be fiat or a full BTC economy?
Get off your high horse mate.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:24:08
I didn't even see that hahaha.. amazing.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:16:49
Awesome mate, enjoy the purchase.. 
It's helped me tame any thoughts of panic selling, and reduce my paranoia about my home network security.. so money well spent!
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:33:48
Futurama and BTC?! I'm in
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:09:33
Thank you for sharing.. roadmap is awesome
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:20:52
!RemindMe to look back on this in 11months!
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:18:48
Yeah it's cool - you get the good feels of giving and increasing the adoption rate of future technology, for the improvement of society in general. On top of challenging corrupt central banks!
Win-win-win in my eyes.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:20:49
I do ask myself this regularly.. with cloud tech like AWS and auto-scaling there is no reason why they can't scale accordingly..
Especially with the extra slice they take for each transaction - madness!
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:11:40
Last week mate, very pleased I must say.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:45:16
So hard to differentiate between the trolls and people just being dumb fucks nowadays 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:55:42
No problem.. there's far too much negativity on this sub, trying to counter that!
I am an avid fan of Andreas, so my opinion is obviously biased. I 100% agree with you on the karma shitposts though, I'd love for them to be true but part of me always doubts them.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:49:48
Fellow European (specifically UK) here, any links to these better alternatives please?
Been lurking in the sub for a few months and have yet to see/find anything more efficient.
My current trade-off with coin-base is: 
Ease of use &gt; fees paid. 
But now I'm more comfortable with the crypto space, I'm looking to reduce those fees as best I can..
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:28:13
Appreciate the insight, will take a look later. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:36:47
Also interested in this, please let me know if you find any useful info
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:37:51
HODL to the mooooooon!
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:59:18
Jesus.. that's grim reading.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:11:45
Fellow newbie here! Profit should be the least of your concerns if you understand and see the potential of blockchain technology.. the way I see it?
If Bitcoin remains King and my investment grows as such, win-win.
If an alternative protocol takes the throne and I "lose" what I've invested, then I've just helped fund an emerging technology/market and helped progress human society, win-win.
As I haven't directly answered your question, check out some of the popular platforms for the type of gains you could see on your investment:
Never invest more than you are afraid to lose..
And remember.. be safe, and HODL.
