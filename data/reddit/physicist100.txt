Because other businesses do stuff to lose money right?

Riiiight. 1) bank IT infrastructure supports a hell of a lot more activity than simple currency or cash transfers. This is like a small fraction. 2) Even considering just cash transfers the volume is many, many orders of magnitude greater than anything the blockchain/bitcoin network currently supports.

In this thread a lot of people who don't know how the futures markets work.

So how could a btc payment be transmitted with an http request? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 10:57:14
But how will the server know you have paid? How do you tell the server? And how is the transfer of btc executed fast enough that page loading is not materially slowed

Yeah. Although folks that have suffered as a result of the recession are probably wanting more regulation of the financial markets not less. Indeed our elected politicians certainly seem to think so. In fact regulation of btc would legitimise it, minimise the risk of adoption for many participants,  and be an all round positive for btc.

You might like to read it too. It only applies to balances of 500k. It's a natural consequence of the ecb having lowered the base rate (main refinancing rate) to negative 10 bps.

Yeah except fed and boe will in all likelihood start hiking within the next 6 months

No. No they are not. They are loaning you from deposits, or from other funds, e.g money borrowed in the money markets. If they haven't got the available funds, they cannot lend to you. If this were not the case bank runs would not be possible, Northern Rock for example wouldn't have failed.

That is actually exactly the same issue banks face now (Google "bank run"). The point is with a large deposit base you can be confident that at any time only a small percentage of people will want to withdraw their money.

Nothing to do with fractional reserve banking. Branches only keep a limited amount of physical cash on premises for security and operational reasons. It's standard to give a heads - up if you need a withdraw a large sum.

▶ mortgage derivatives
I think you mean "mortgage backed securities" which are not derivatives, quite different.
