nobodybelievesyou is a known troll and hater, look through his history.
ignore whatever he says.

sure but that's just a matter of time.

i don't think there is a regular downvote bot here.
there are usually as many downvotes in new threads as there are active trolls posting comments throughout this sub during that time.
the only thing that was weird recently was some thread criticizing banks. the anti-bitcoin bs there had hundreds of upvotes, but that's a rare thing to see.
still really should vote more and actually think before voting.

bitcoin doesn't solve the byzantine generals problem and it probably is unsolvable.
stop talking shit and fuck off already.

[fyi bitcoin doesn't solve the byzantine generals problem](

except the average person has no reason to actively spend time to tell people how much they hate bitcoin.
neither does the average internet troll as most of them love bitcoin. none of the criticisms are funny anyway, so they're hardly written by actual trolls.

what? why would that article need to mention bitcoin?
it shows that all known ways don't solve the problem, including bitcoin.
it would be retarded to mention every single protocol/technology that *doesn't* solve the problem, especially because it is considered unsolvable.

nobody outside the US gives a fuck about this.
if you have too much money, invest it in infrastructure.

just fuck off already.
@_date: 2014-04-25 02:06:37
that makes no difference. stop being stupid.
bitcoin is just another way to handle byzantine fault tolerance but there is still room for error, just like with any other non-solution that was found so far.
