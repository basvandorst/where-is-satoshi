Maybe to help understand the word better, one might add that "Fiat Lux" is the Latin for "Let there be light". You may be familiar with that phrase from christian mythology or other abrahamic religions. Calling government issued money "fiat currency" is implying that the government (or whoever issues the stuff) basically said "Let there be money" and conjured money out of nothing.
The exact definition can be a bit hard to nail down, and may lead you down a semantic rabbit hole or two, but what's generally meant by it is any currency the issuer of which can, at least in theory, but usually also in practice, issue more of any time they like, as often as they like and in any amount they like.

Where exactly are you taking those numbers from?
I'm a bit concerned about calling for 1 confirmation for transactions between 301 and 1000 USD worth. In some department stores (furniture stores, household electronics stores), that's still inside the range where customers will regularly come up with a shopping cart of goods worth about that to a real life cash register and expect to pay and be done in less than one minute. Waiting for the first Bitcoin confirmation can take up to twenty minutes, though.
We should think a bit more about what exactly it would take for an attacker to exploit zero-confirmation or one-confirmation transactions, and what the risk this might actually happen is at a given price-point. The risk will probably rise in proportion to the values transacted, because a successful double-spend attack takes a lot of effort and hashing-power, and if the possible reward is small, it is unlikely anybody will even try.
So, how can you pull an attack off?
- Go on a shopping spree for something expensive, say you want to pay with Bitcoin
- At the exact time you are sending your payment, craft a competing transaction, using the exact same outputs, but do not send that one out to the network. It is important that the vendor does not see your competing transaction untils it's too late
- Send the competing transaction to a miner you are collaborating with and have them include that one in the next block. Hope this miner actually gets the next block. You don't actually need 50% hashing power for that step yet, although your likelyhood of success will of course be quite low without that.
- Hope the other miners will actually accept that block and base their next blocks on this one. If they have seen the "real" transaction before the new block with the competing transaction, they might reject that block. Of course, if you control 50+% of the hashing power, that doesn't matter because you can just brute-force your chain to be the longest. This would make the blockchain grow significantly slower for a while (because all the blocks from competing miners get discarded).
On the other hand, if you can control the network connections of the victim for some reason, you have other options. You can then control what transactions they even get to see. In this case, you make sure that the victim will see only your "real" payment transaction, the one he was expecting, and the rest of the network will see only the competing transaction, which will just send the coins back to yourself. In this case, your hashing power does not even matter for 0-confirmation attacks, but it will matter for 1+ confirmation attacks. (You still have to present the victim a valid-looking block that contains your payment transaction. Coming up with that will take significantly longer than the usual ten minutes if you don't have a majority of hashing power.)
In conclusion, I'd say:
If you accept 0 confirmation Bitcoin payments for values over USD 500 worth, make sure you always have secure and integrity protected connections to various trusted third party nodes. If those connections start breaking down, immediately switch to 1- or 2-confirmation payments.

Ahem, Zimbabwe was much worse than that, and much worse, too, than Bitcoin on its worst days, back when they still even had a currency. Look it up on Wikipedia:  . Towards the end, the inflation rate went up to 89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000%. That's 23 digits of percent points. That number is so large I had to look up how to pronounce it. (The word is sextillion in the short scale (American) and quintillion in the long scale (European).)

Sure it does. You can write bad code in any programming language, but you cannot write good code in all programming languages.
Some languages make it easy to quickly write something that works superficially but contains hidden subtle problems that only surface later in production. Doing it right, so that you can avoid those problems you weren't even aware of when you started, then quickly turns out to be hard, counter-intuitive and convoluted and produce magnitudes more code than the simple thing you started with, and you still cannot be sure there isn't still some corner-case you have forgotten.
Other languages are designed so that the simplest, most obvious and most straightforward way to do things is also the correct way for most of the uses that language is advertised for. Good languages give you little opportunity to introduce subtle bugs by just forgetting something. Instead, they tend to turn subtle bugs into big and obvious ones that will be noticed immediately instead of later when the software is already in use.

Yeah, for example, I remember setting up a vsftp server once, and the docs said that using SSL is not recommended because there is no way the author can vouch for the security of the OpenSSL code that would be linked in in that case.
Maybe the author of that docs was not being reasonable, but still, if someone who has looked at that code feels compelled to say that an unencrypted Internet service is probably more secure than one secured by OpenSSL... the mind boggles.
@_date: 2014-04-23 08:37:26
OpenSSL has grown organically over decades, and the result is convoluted, overly complex and pretty hard to use. Just getting it to use only the ciphers and modes that you want and trust to be secure is a challenge even for seasoned experts.
The OpenBSD team has a pretty solid reputation for producing secure code, and not just because they brag about it any chance they get. They do have security holes in their history, but then everybody does and their track record is still better than just about everybody elses.
Following the mantra that code that is so simple it obviously has no defects is better than code that is so complex it has no obvious defects, their first order of business is making a thorough house cleaning of the code base, throwing out old stuff that is no longer used or should no longer be used. The resulting smaller and simpler code makes it much easier to get every line and every crucial path scrutinized.

Because nobody is actually using SSL client certificates.
SSL client certificates are an optional part of SSL and are rarely if ever used, to the point that many IT professionals are unaware that that's even an option. Most will just automatically think of server certificates when hearing "SSL" and "certificate" in one sentence. Where they are used, they make password leaks impossible. (Unless, of course, the website also offers password logins.)
The only public facing website I know of that actually uses client side certificates for authentication is cacert.org.
The thing is, whether it is widely used or not, it solves the exact same problem bitid does, and in almost exactly the same way, too, and it has the advantage that almost all browsers and webservers out there are already compatible with it.
Also, the blockchain has exactly zero relevance to any of this. It might be relevant if you were using Namecoin addresses instead of Bitcoin, in which case this could solve one problem that ssl client certificates can not yet solve in a satisfactorily decentralised way: Proving that the public key/address you are trying to authenticate really belongs to the person or organisation you think it belongs to. SSL uses a centralized hierarchy of certificate authorities for that, with way too many CAs effectively being trusted for signing anything they want.

Sort of true, but a bit beside the point. It used to be that if you could trust the bare metal and the hypervisor and the person operating it (for example because that person is you), you could also trust the security of the VPS. With this new attack vector, you also need to be able to trust all the other VPSes running on the same metal.

See, this is something you should have mentioned in your press release, instead of making sure you mention the word "security" three times in one sentence.
There are still some open questions that the press release really should answer, but doesn't:
- Are you currently using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL to provide encryption to your site?
- Have you at any point in the past been using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL to provide encryption to your site?
- If the answer to the previous question is yes (or maybe), to the best of your knowledge, from when to when were you using the vulnerable versions?
- If you have been using a vulnerable version at any point in the past, have you made sure to change your private keys since then? (According to u/giact, you have not. You can change your certificate without changing your private keys, but you cannot change your private keys without changing your certificate, so if your certificate has not changed, then your private keys haven't, either.)
Unless your press release answers all of these points, it will remain nothing but PR drivel.

Sound might be a hard thing to port between BSD and Linux. Linux uses ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) for sound, and OpenBSD doesn't support that.
Also, generally speaking, what music production software usually needs most from its platform is low and consistent latency, i.e. when you are pressing a button on your keyboard, it shouldn't take somewhere between 10 and 100 milliseconds for something to come out of your speakers. This is not a major focus of OpenBSD.

Corporation has nothing to do with opinion, it has a very simple definition:
A corporation is its own legal entity, as opposed to just the name a real person or a group of persons do business under.
According to the pfsense website (assuming we are both talking about pfsense.org), they are run by "Electric Sheep Fencing LLC", with LLC meaning "Limited Liability Corporation".
So, yeah, they are a a corporation, that much is out of the question. What is still open to debate is just what that means in context with accepting BTC or not.

From the experience with my own transactions, blockchain.info usually gets it wrong, too.

Not true. The first thing SSL does is authenticate the server using its server certificate, because if it didn't, man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker pretends to be the real server, but really only relays the traffic over another encrypted connection to the real server, would be way too easy to pull off.
The thing most people don't realise is that SSL can optionally do the exact same authentication for the client, too, using a client certificate. Most users of SSL do not do that, opting instead to exchange traditional passwords over the encrypted channel once that has been established, but it is a possibility, and I have successfully used it in the past.

We've had this discussion in the past, but it bears repeating:
blockchain.info's numbers are not reliable. They attribute blocks to pools depending on where one of their nodes first saw the block coming from. They have no idea, though, whether that node was already forwarding that block from somewhere else or whether it actually generated it. If ghash.io happens to better connected than blockchain, blockchain is bound to overreport ghash.io's mining power. If the direct connectivity between blockchain.info and ghash.io is bad for some reason, they will underreport it.

The problem here is that Bitcoins - and other financial sums, too, btw - are not floats. They are fixed-point numbers. That's an entirely different thing. By squeezing them into floating point arithmetic, you are introducing errors that you now have to compensate by introducing a complex external arbitrary precision number library - which by the way doesn't give you floats, either, it gives you fixed-point number with arbitrary precision. Which are not even needed here because Bitcoins have a known lower bound of precision that fits very comfortably in 64 bits.

Victim blaming stinks, but that doesn't change the simple fact that there is no way to safely use bitcoins if you cannot keep your computer secure - or more specifically, if you cannot keep every computer that might touch your unencrypted private keys and/or the passphrases to your private keys secure.
You could get around this problem by moving the handling of private keys to a known secure computer, preferably a special-use computer that not even the most careless user could accidentally install malware on and that has a very small attack surface, being powered off and disconnected when not in use.

Their position was that the biggest problem with the CPI was that the statistic completely ignores mortgage payments on owner-occupied housing, using an ownership-equivalent rent figure instead (what the same house/apartment would cost if it were rented).

HSTS is an extension to HTTP that a webserver can use to tell a visiting browser that this website is only and exclusively available via HTTPS (that is, SSL-encrypted)
See [HSTS](
The browser will remember that setting between sessions for a configurable time (often 180 days), so that if the same user comes back to the site later, the browser won't even try unencrypted HTTP.
Without HSTS, an attacker can play man-in-the-middle by pretending to be the server you are trying to talk to and pretending that HTTPS is not available.

I don't understand why he feels the need to cram that into XT, though. For the record, I'm a big supporter of the patches to improve zero-conf transaction, but the difference is, a) those do not require a hardfork b) they are not quite as urgent as the need to to increase the blocksize. Personally, I believe XT would have a better chance at success if it contained only the BIP 101 patch and absolutely nothing else.

Of course, they *do* support SofortÜberweisung, where you give full access to your bank account, including the ability to send some of your money to whereever, to some third party.
This is even worse than paying with credit cards:
* The third party (Sofort) can view all of your account data and transaction history, making this a huge privacy issue.
* It sends a bank transfer using the interface that is supposed to only ever be used the actual account holder, and is, thus, non-reversable.
Sofort is exactly the sort of shit you'll want to avoid by using Bitcoin instead.

Hm, maybe Coinbase should make confirmation emails mandatory for all withdrawals?
You know, whenever a user tries to withdraw any funds, send an email to their address (make sure users cannot easily change email addresses without a substantial waiting period and multiple warnings to the old address) with a random lengthy confirmation string. Don't actually send the Bitcoins until the user copy-pastes that confirmation string back to the Coinbase interface. This could catch a lot of attacks.

So called man-in-the-middle attack. SSL can protect against that, in theory, but:
- Users need to actually check the SSL-verification status and stop their login attempts if it doesn't show green. Instead, most users have been conditioned for more than a decade by badly configured HTTPS sites to actively dismiss SSL errors.
- Users need to be able to tell the difference between a green "SSL-protected" logo inside the website itself and the actual SSL status indicator of their own browser. You'd be surprised how many people struggle with that. (Except if you've ever worked in IT support, in which case you probably know what I'm talking about...)
- SSL/TLS has got a little feature called "certificate chaining". Thanks to that feature, there are more than 600 certificate authorities (CAs) out there that can issue certificates that your browser will recognise as valid, and nobody has a full list of these. In order to trust SSL, you will need to trust every single one of those CAs. This certificate chaining feature is widely used by completely legitimate sites, too, so you cannot just disable it either.

In a sane world, this would just be treated as carelessness by the bank, and if they cannot get ahold of the debtor and get him to pay back the credit, that's just their problem and not anyone elses.
In this case, it's even more infuriating, because the bank failed to properly ensure the identity of the costumer they were extending a line of credit to, and now apparently all other businesses that might accept money from said creditor in exchange for services is apparently required to run KYC checks far in excess of what the bank did or face prosecution for being complicit in money laundering.

I wouldn't necessarily call that positive. It depends a lot on the exact wording. For all you know, they might require every single computer in the business to be running Symantec Antivirus, even the OpenBSD based servers...
Generally speaking, you can not make a complex computer network secure simply by installing and running some off-the-shelf security software, but you can make it less secure that way if you don't know what you are doing. Security software mandated by law can be extremely counterproductive, from a security point of view.


Depends on who this license applies to. If it applies to anybody accepting payment in BTC, then yes. If it only applies to exchanges, payment processors, web wallets and the like, then no.




Capital requirements are not a tax. You are required to have the money, not to give it up to the government.
Personally, I would even support 100% capital requirements, i.e. you must always actually have the total sum of all satoshis and all dollars you hold for other people.
A much more interesting question would be, can you use BTC to satisfy the capital requirements for the parts of your business that are denominated in BTC, or do they all have to be in USD? *That* would be disastrous.

Okay, I have to admit, I am neither an economist nor do I have any way of getting reliable numbers about the bitcoin economy. If I had a lot of time, I might go to  go through all the listed businesses (except the exchanges), try to find if they're still alive, if they're still accepting Bitcoins (not obvious in too many cases) and how much revenue they make in BTC.
I still stand by my point however.
Bitcoin has traded around 10€ by new year and risen by about 1500% in four months and a couple of days. If this price was really founded in reality and not just purely speculative, the Bitcoin economy would have had to grow by the same amount in the same time. I believe this claim would be so far out there, the burden of proof lies clearly with those saying it did rather than with those saying it did not.
Comparing the BTC market cap with what traditional banks have does not make much sense IMHO. They have a hand in a very large percentage of real world economy. Bitcoin does not. You can speculate on that changing some time down the road, but, well, that's speculation...

Legal tender means that if a debtor who has a debt to a creditor offers legal tender (in an appropriate quantity) to settle the debt, the debt is settled in eyes of the law, and the creditor is not given the option to refuse.
Bitcoin is definitely not legal tender in that regard. Having Bitcoin recognized as "private money" and a "unit of account" has many benefits from a legal and taxation POV, but it is still a far cry from legal tender. The only legal tender in Germany is the Euro.

Cex.io is running a model that makes it extremely convenient for investors to pump new capital in there. They have their hashing power on hand by the time you can buy it. Their GHash-exchange makes investors believe they can get their capital out at any time. (And they can - if they are willing to eat the loss from falling prices…) Since they immediately turn their mining hardware into money the moment they bring it online (without even having to deal with shipping, support calls, returns, etc.), they can immediately reinvest into even more hardware.
This is all is apparently a recipe for growing a pool extremely large, extremely fast.
What we need, IMHO, is another mining contract provider much like cex.io, except it doesn't run its own pool, but instead allows users to choose between various third-party pools.

I think if and when Bitcoin ever gets so far that Joe Sixpack will want to use it, we will see the emergence of specialized hardware wallets - much like a smartphone with the Android Bitcoin app today, but cheaper, more durable and not doing anything except handling bitcoins, so as to minimize the risk of trojans stealing the private keys.
Cloud wallets might be another direction this development could take, but I hope it won't. Cloud wallets IMHO undo a lot of the advantages of Bitcoins, i.e. the situation where you have direct control over your funds, without third parties involved, yet still can send them to anybody you want anywhere in the world on short notice and at very little or no cost.

No, they don't, not for small transactions anyway. They just check whether your transaction is valid in principle and wait a second or so to see if there's any competing transactions on the net. Theoretically, they could still be hit with a double-spend attack at that point until it is actually included in a block, but pulling that off is pretty hard - the network will reject new transactions that conflict with known transactions, even if the known transaction is not confirmed yet - and it is not at all unreasonable to just assume that nobody will go to those lengths for an amount of bitcoins worth a bag of groceries.
If the transaction's value is much higher, like enough for a new car, the waiting time usually doesn't matter so much.

No, the article was spot on. Bitcoin has value because people believe in it. Its structure and properties that make it convenient as a currency help with that - but in the end what gives them value, what makes people give you valuable things like food, shelter, labor in exchange for these things, is belief and only belief and nothing else.
The *real* interesting points are:
* This exact same thing goes for every other currency out there as well, be it national currencies, stones or laundry detergent, and, in fact, with a slight variation in wording maybe, even the nation states themselves.
* The reason here, the belief, may seem abstract, even fickle, but the result, the value, is very much real, and the belief and the value supporting each other form a system that is self-sustaining to a degree.

This attitude is starting to get a bit toxic.
Yes, the decentralised nature of the community / economy means it can survive some of its players, even the major ones, to falter and will ideally give rise to new ones in their place.
However, it's still definitely unhealthy if many of the major players keep dying like flies left and right. Some basic level of stability is still needed for growth and progress.

I don't think transactions can time out, even when they don't contain a TX fee. AFAIK, the only way a valid transaction can possibly not eventually end up in the blockchain is if a some miner includes a conflicting valid transaction (i.e. one that is trying to spend the same input) in a valid block before that happens. The network is pretty good at avoiding that, though. If the conflicting transaction gets broadcast to the network after the transaction you want, the network will notice the conflict and will not even put the conflicting tx into the queue for the new block. Of course, there is still the possibility that the conflicting transaction has been partially flooded to the network but has not reached your node yet at the point of accepting it (through careful timing).
The best way to accept 0 confirmation transactions is probably to wait a couple of seconds and then ask a couple of third parties (like blockchain.info) whether they have this TX in queue.

I would much rather petition blockchain.info to update the way they calculate the total power use for bitcoin mining. Their electricity consumption figure of 650 Watts per Gigahash/s is way outdated and works as bad propaganda against bitcoin.

Note that this is only about VAT for buying or selling Bitcoins for Euros.
If you sell your Bitcoins (for Euros) within 1 year of buying them, you might still have to pay capital gains tax and maybe even income tax for that. No idea what happens if you use Bitcoins to buy valuable things after a big rate increase. If in doubt, ask a licensed tax accountant.

I don't like exchanges with no fees.

Don't be too harsh. This guy probably has a lot on his plate every day and just didn't have the time to give Bitcoin more than a cursory glance, and said glance probably went to those curves and diagrams we all know. He got one major aspect wrong (The rules were changed to disallow certain forms of mining - the rules were never changed, CPU mining just became unprofitable in the face of GPUs, FPGAs and now ASICS.), but that doesn't mean he's stupid.
As others have already pointed out elsewhere, bitcoin is not entirely trivial. You can understand it in an afternoon (if you happen to find actually helpful sources), but you cannot understand it in half an hour.

This should be a wake up call for anyone using 2FA without backing up their 2FA keys. Not that I'm defending bugs like this in a security app, but:
Your smartphone getting lost or stolen or broken at some point is a very real possibility. Make sure if and when it happens, it's not a catastrophe to you. Back the 2FA key up onto separate, possibly encrypted, media. If you use the Android wallet, do the same thing with those keys.

The miners are pretty well distributed over the wealthier countries, so a nuclear war that takes out 99% of them would also take out 99% of the population in the richest parts of the world.
If that happened and I were a survivor, my priorities would be to find out where the last non-contaminated areas on the earth are (probably by hearsay, because the internet would not work anymore), make it there somehow, and not die in the process.

Seriously, we all know where the price hikes of the last two weeks came from: Greedy people trying to get rich fast. They buy because the price keeps rising and the price keeps rising because they keep buying. It's almost a picture book example of an economic bubble.
Sure, the actual bitcoin economy (i.e. merchants / service providers accepting bitcoins as payment) is coming along nicely, it's just not nearly enough to justify this $2bn market capitalization. I just hope those merchants know what they're getting into and are prepared for the coming crash, because if not and if most of them go bankrupt from it, all this excitement and buzz will have been for nothing. If they do survive - and keep accepting bitcoin - they might very well form the foundation of a real and much more solid bitcoin economy in the future.

The real question here is, IMHO, why would a harddisk encryption tool save the password as a salted SHA1 hash? The way I see it, such software should have no reason to save this password on disk at all, not even as some kind of hash. It's not an access control system, it's encryption. When the user enters their password, you can either use it to decrypt the HD or you can't.

It's a slightly different concept. The idea behind VAT is that every actor in the value creation chain pays taxes equivalent to the value they are adding to the product or services they are selling. This is implemented by collecting VAT for every single purchase - even raw materials and purely b2b stuff - but refunding every business that itself has to collect VAT for the VAT they paid to their suppliers as part of their supply purchases.
Sales tax, on the other hand, is only collected for sales to final customers. See

No. Umsatzsteuer and Mehrwertsteuer are basically the same thing, and they are Value Added Tax. There is no sales tax like in the USA in Germany.

Actually, every single one of those pics is wrong, and so is his conclusion (or at least the way he comes to this conclusion).
The first cell phones were around in the 1980s. The first personal computers hail from the 1970s, and so does the Internet, arguably. Even the WWW is much more than 4 years older than Google.
(The actual birth of the Internet cannot be easily pinpointed, and is to a degree a matter of opinion. The first data lines between various American universities, which formed the backbone of what would later become the Internet, were put into place in the late 1960s. The basic principles of Inter-network routing upon which the Internet builds were developed and formulated in the 1970s (by Vint Cerf, not Al Gore). The Internet Protocol version 4 was accepted as a standard in 1981. IMHO, no later date than that can be seriously considered as the birth of the Internet.)

A quick google search brought this up:
Short answer:
Expiring transactions are not something you need to worry about. Since transactions do not include a time field, you could, if you were paranoid about this, just copy the transaction you want to go through and manually rebroadcast it to the network periodically until it does get confirmed.

From a technological standpoint, yes, absolutely. Your point being?


Again from a technological standpoint, I understand very well what we are dealing with here. It does not explain the growth one way or another.


Arguably yes. Not the Internet itself, of course, there was never a time when you could buy or sell pieces of Internet, and there is no Internet &lt;=&gt; USD exchange rate, however, the next best thing, the dotcom-industry, definitely was a bubble.
Just like now, there was a new, extremely hyped thing and a lot of investors with excess liquidity hoping to invest somehow. They got excited about the new technology, so they pumped a lot of money into all the hip new Internet startups that had sprung to live recently, in the hopes that what those did would turn out to be useful and valuable on a massive scale later on. Those hopes, as we know now, were not entirely unfounded, however the underlying economy and value creation could not keep up with the influx of money and the rise in stock prices. This lead to a bubble. A big one. And it crashed, as bubbles do.
Now, the interesting part is what happened afterwards. Some companies, like Amazon, Ebay and Google survived the crash, but you have to keep in mind that those were the exception, not the rule. A great many companies just crashed and burned. The survivors would climb back in value after some time, even to values that now make the bubble-prices seem small, but that was much slower growth than what happened during the bubble, and this time around, it was actually founded on actual revenue.
Now, this might happen with Bitcoin as well, but still, just because it might some years later get to this point does not mean the current price is justified by economic reality or that it is anything more than speculation.


No, they did not, Bitcoin is rising much faster.


I don't think so, but we will see.

Tons of people said that, from antiquity to modern times. Pretty much everybody who ever wrote or talked seriously about the basic concept of law making did so, save maybe Machiavelli.
It just doesn't always work out like that. It gets subverted both by people trying to use the laws as tools for their own interests and by people with a bad - or just different - concept of ethics. I'm sure you won't have trouble finding people who fully believe trading drugs is unethical and consequently jailing those who do that or otherwise keeping them from doing that is ethical. I'm also pretty sure the FBI agents behind that sting were fully convinced they were doing the right thing.
