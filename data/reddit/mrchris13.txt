Its not a [ponzi scheme]( Are we talking about everyone or just the OP? OP asked if he should buy.

buy it and sit on it. forget about it! Put it on a paper wallet and stick it in a bank deposit box!

I think coinbase allows for automatic buys. Maybe set a side a small amount of your paycheck to automatically purchased every week/month/2months

@_date: 2013-11-28 05:52:23
You could buy a bit more once you feel compfortable. Small steps
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:15:47

@_date: 2013-11-26 20:11:38
get your coinbase account set up and just wait for another crash or buy in with a few hundred bucks

Ok. I plan on diversifing my portfiolo. This works the same with Litecoin and Feathercoin as well right?
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:24:01
I would say investments can be bought/sold any time of the year. All depends on price/value. Not January

buy btc-exchange it to ltc on btc-e eaisest way
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:42:59
Using Linux and all that is a bit complicated for me. I used bit adress. I disconnected my computer and hit generate several times and printed off a few wallets. I also did this with FTC and LTC. I assume this is fine and I can trust that the keys will work?
How should I back up my paper wallets? They are going in my bank safe box
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:24:27

@_date: 2013-11-19 05:01:47

@_date: 2013-11-21 00:10:13
Sounds very complex! Just trying to get btc on btc-e and sell on coinbase. Tough to do it i guess
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:22:29
