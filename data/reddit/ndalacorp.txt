Can bitcoin scale to a national or global level? No.
Will governments allow their national currencies to be taken over by a currency not of host nation origin, even in the event of an economic crash? No.
Have other crypto currencies beaten Bitcoin in technology, Yes.
Is bitcoin only seen as a store of value rather than an alternative to fiat currency to everyone other than bitcoin maximalists? Yes.

Very true if lightning network can work. I still think large countries governments won’t let bitcoin take over their fiat without a large scale effort to stop it in its tracks.

Market cap doesn’t equate to the actual amount of money invested into the crypto currency, the amount can be far less than the market cap, thought that was old news. Also, a significant amount of money invested in to bitcoin is from tether.

... I invest in crypto that possess real world uses and have larger differences between current price and ATH for higher potential ROI.

I agree but to a certain extent, the majority of the population aren’t switched on and will blindly follow a governments policies regardless of a economic crash.
