Same needs to be continually expressed for Online wallets. Sure they are easy and depending on what you use can have a Zero TX fee between users of the same service. But it's much like throwing a party among friends and leaving a C-Note on the counter. Someone may have brought a third party with them that is dis honest as they get and Poof.
I use this when i explain Bitcoin holdings to new users in my area. They also ask questions about exchanges and trading. For some reason a majority of people act like the miners do. They obtain it and wait for a pump and cash out to USD and want it in the good ole Paypal account by the next working day. 
Point of currency is to use it. Sure trade it but don't discount the fact you can actually use what you have.

Yes but it's a hassle. You wait a week then open an automated case wherein the seller then has 3 days to deliver on his end. Be it physical or digital. After three days you then prompt the system to Alter a moderator basically who then reviews the claim. The seller has time between the 3 days and the time it takes the mod to figure things out. This can be less then 24 hours or another week. After that you have a charge back time if it was done on a card.  Instant if it was PayPal balance.
The point is, it's a friggin hassle. And a waste of time because if you don't hit the windows you are screwed

I believe the CIA notion to be pretty buyable. The reason being another movement has experienced the same cause and effect. Look at the people rallying around Ammon and Ryan Bundy. And those who believe LaVoy Finicum was assassinated by the FBI.
People who haven't been anymore active then spending time to speak about the US constitution and common law have been harassed and bullied after being offered money to be paid informants. Its easy to find this information. Most of have declined end up distancing themselves from the movements. Not only because they are being watched. But so as long as they have association they do not have stable life's.
I hope as sad as it would be that it's true in Gavin's case

I really think this is an example of the mentality to come. What will happen once all bitcoins are mined and it's purely transaction fee's paying the miners?  You think it's bad now and the moaning is unbearable. wait until it comes down to labors of love and grass roots shit powering this network.
I actually hate the big league miners with a passion. I adore those guys that are out there obviously a far cry from ever making ROI on a machine they have bought second and sometimes third hand on eBay. Sucking up 10 cents per kw hour for a dollar or a little more a week. Telling themselves. "I don't care I enjoy this and someday it will have been worth it"
Those are the individuals believe it or not. That are actually voting along with the limited amount of high power miners that are.. For the soft fork. Those are the miners that really count in my book because they are dedicated

From the Book:
The Real Story of the Money-Control Over America Pg 11
If we would have used the Constitutional way of "creating" the money needed in the nation, the Federal Congress would spend most of its time and study on the issuance and control of an adequate supply of stable money for the people. If an increase of population and production required an increase in the medium of exchange, Congress would authorize the "coining," (i.e., printing) of the determined amount. Some could be used to pay current legitimate expenses of the Federal Government, with the balance paid directly to the citizens. Records for payment would be similar to Social Security records, except a citizen would be recorded at birth, instead of when he first goes to work. Each person on the records as of the date of the Congressional authorization would receive an equal amount just as if he were a stockholder holding one' share. Just think - a payment of only $20 to each citizen would put $4 billion of debt-free and interest-free money into circulation.
Such a suggestion always scares the Bankers. Their propagandists will immediately cry, "printing press money." and warn that it would soon be "worthless" and would "cause inflation."
The truth is their immense usury chases on their "created" credit (our debt) is the sole cause of "inflation." All prices on all industry, trade and labor must be raised periodically to pay the ever increasing usury charges. That is the ONLY cause of higher prices, and the money-changers spend millions in propaganda to keep you from realizing that.
The money-creators (Bankers) know that if we ever tried a Constitutional issue of debt-free, interest-free currency, even a limited issue, the benefits would be apparent .immediately. That they must prevent. Abraham Lincoln was the last President to issue such debt-free and interest-free currency (in 1863) and he was assassinated shortly thereafter.

This is the world we live in. Someone will always think they can do better then what's been proven to already work.
In this case it's slightly more then that. It has somewhat in this case to do with a group who feels because they have stake in bitcoin related hardware. They need total control of the behavior of the ecosystem in general. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:56:52
Folks this is life in general look around you. A prime example for me to compare this to is the elks club. Many lodges saw an obvious decline in membership. No dues no money for operation. Many of them hired new bar tenders and high pay management to hopefully spend money to make money. The big fight was they either had to the bar doors to the public. Hold events and other activities or sell the building they where in and start over.
What happened to a majority of them was the management and staff hired ran them.into the ground. Standard bar shit.. People getting​ more then a liberal amount of free hand outs in drinks. Money theft. And poor event choices for the elmer fud group. 
End result was the winning sides that voted to take losses. That being, sell the infrastructure to begin with and scale efforts in a new building. Won and fired the staff in favor of salvaging what was left of the fraternity's reputation. Most if not all that did this are still around and doing well. 
I can't tell you what happened to the opposition but i can tell you based upon what I saw. It was pure trial.by fire. 
Same applies here. A few moss backs teamed up with some "power hitters" that got behind the controls and now have hands in both the tip jar and the cash drawer. I seriously do.not believe they're looking at either side to win. They just see what money they can.make before getting fired and returning to some other day job.
Life bitches, you are welcome

I've deleted like 5 responses. All positive, so let me just get to the hopes and dreams. My hope as well as the hope of many is that miners will see what the people want. I actually mine myself and will not deny i am pro core. A cheerleader by no means. Im just comfortable keeping the dev market open and not having a bitcoin jesus telling me what my money is going to do

All the models will run a node with ease. But i would recommend a ModelB+. Zeros are as you know just a bic lighter sized model A. 
I have around 12 pis ranging from the second gen to the current. Plus two zeros and i can tell you right now each one has it's own quirks.
They all do extremely well long term. One of my zeros i use for Outernet and plane watching. I keep the zero in my basement as i have a clear sky view from a window. Im big on air flow in my home so i just dangled it over a fan i have that runs 24/7. It keeps pretty warm even with that type of forced air on it and minimal computing.
The other one I have OSMC plugged into and let me tell you this much in short it runs hot. I do believe however it has something to do with the sandwich case I purchased for it. I honestly think if i add another 4 spacers and longer screws it will radiate heat more even.
My first gens I jumped on the cluster computer band wagon with. They're extremely bitchy when it comes to heat. So they each have a fan connected with a dinky box fan pushing air from the left side. 
My new gens  sit as my miner controllers and a node. I put a fan on the one running the node.. But I don't really think it needs it. The miner controllers sit in the path of my airflow for the miners so they do just fine.
I will say this much I do have heatsinks on all my pis(minus the zero's and that might be some of my problems with the zero. As said they all react different so the best thing I can say to do. Is put them under some load and see what they do

Anyone who has been with BTC since or around its birth will understand what the fucking floor is. The dirt grime and shit on our boots sits at around $905-$930. The surface cleaning is closer to 1k. If It drops back to it's $700 range shits happening and problems exist. Otherwise this news actually breeds adoption. I'm sorry but any time feds show BTC a middle finger I smile.

How much of the network's users actually care either way? What exactly is the numbers based upon individuals who mine, care about holding onto coin via a wallet that's also acting as a support node. And those that just trust in the IOU system exchanges offer. And don't give two licks about miners, nodes or the code that backs either?
I don't know if it matters but most traders are clueless to what's going on. They only see the rise in prices. Then try to scrape some off the wall reason as to why.
Not that i think that mentality will ever change.. But don't you think its time the sleeping masses get edified? Maybe that would help fraction's at a time

The intent and the flow for some time was even a decentralized hardware market. Buy the chips and develop the boards. Some projects of course did not do well ie:the klondike miners. Others didn't even make it off the drawing board but really where some of the influences for even what Bitmain have produced.
I do believe what the OP has said is valid and a wonderful concept. Bitcoin represents allot of liberty and has brought many people into the whole idea of being wide awake and aware.
Perhaps if the core projects surrounding BTC(In question Namecoin) was able to have some more support and life put back into it. The idea of starting  up the old miners might be something to look at.
Back in 2011-13 you had just the basics 5 coins tops and we where still learning. We are still learning but holy shit the advancements that we have made. A hardware wallet isn't just something bring drawn up abd prototyped on bread boards.  Payment systems for online and b&amp;m are not tacky concept code. Standards for WoT have been set and methods of id verification without to much need for total transparent behavior have allowed the system to grow and be what it should be. The peoples currency.  
Abd the BU supporters should take note this all happened by the grace of hundreds of adopters, devs and patriots across the world. It takes more then what BU thinks it does by a long shot.

BUs is being  developed an pushed by an individual who not is in business to build and sell mining hardware. But also has what %5 of the PoW stake.

Annnnd has managed to make a good number of college level kids jaded by the entire pipe dream of lies and deception. ..
I see individual's saying this is a war. Sorry its not a war. It however is another chapter in the whole social Experiment that is bitcoin. Its proof you have a number of people who no matter what. Will always be hooked to the tit of centralized lifestyle. 
Perhaps those people are better off returning to the USD or Euro and closing the BTC chapter in their life's
