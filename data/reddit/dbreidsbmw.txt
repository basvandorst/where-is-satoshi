Same thing if you won the lottery, lawyer up, get a tax professional to help minimize exposure legally. Diversify your money and live off the interest. Seeing as you have over 3.5 million that's enough to start a trust and live off the excess interest while still maintaining your trust funds totally value with inflation.

Hey seems like a scam? Western union flagged the second payment. So I'm only out $700. 
Also if you're going to China I might just ask if you can buy some if you're willing and I can get cash to you? Can I slide (my wallet) into those DM's?

A larger portion of the network is space, and easy use of ground to space access for our nodes to the satellite portion of the network.

$800 per S9 miner and a 3 year warranty from the manufacturer...

That's fair but at the same time I work in industrial manufacturing we charge tens of thousands of dollars for some parts we make but our customers still make a profit using them. The difference is the machine shop I work at doesn't want to be in the cargo ship business or the pile driving business, or research and development of diesel engines. They don't want to speculate in the value of gold, they want to make their money selling gold mining equipment.

And honestly that is what I am thinking. Buy them to mark them up and sell them here locally. Even if I have to ship within the US.
