Thank you!

I don't work for Bitpay, so I can't answer that. Any other questions?

The more the better! It's such an amazing technology, I can't believe more are adopting it. I guess the unknown is scary :)


I don't think so, but let me look into it.


This is definitely a recurring theme in this thread. Looking into it.
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:13:02
It is!

We are adding close to 100 stocks and ETFs every week. Our focus the past few weeks was almost exclusively single stocks but in two weeks we will be adding a lot more ETFs. Let me look into adding VTSMX, VGTSX, VTSAX and VTIAX.
Thank you for the feedback and suggestions

Barry from DriveWealth Technologies here. If you have any questions, fire away!

If you want, yes. We offer free practice investing accounts to anyone. We want people to feel comfortable with investing and DriveWealth (the company and the application) before depositing real money.

Our thoughts exactly :) One of our main goals with DriveWealth is to bring affordable investing to everyone outside the US. Bitcoin seems like a natural fit for us, especially since transferring funds globally usually involves high fees and long settlement times.


Right now we support English, Spanish and Simplified Chinese. Adding more in the new year.

To refer friends and family your best bet is to use the referral code in your welcome email, that way we know they came from you. Also, it sounds like you would want to open a joint account with your girlfriend. Let me know if there is anything else.

Not in the near future, but we do offer ADRs. I know it's not exactly what you were looking for, but maybe it's close enough? :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:55:31
We only allow Bitcoins in.
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:50:11


We cannot hold them, only immediately convert them to the market price (with zero fees of course)

Haaa, one step at a time bettercoin! Let me figure out how to rapidly decrease the current deposit settlement times and then move on to withdrawals. For now, I will accept my status as a mere mortal.
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:08:16


"something something cash settlement time" :) Actually, it takes a day or so to settle the funds to our bank, which we can then make available to the customer. However, we are working with Bitpay to get to as close as real time as possible. 
Right now, we only take Bitcoins in but I'll look into some of the options you provided. Thanks for the suggestions.

I haven't used Robinhood, so I can't really comment on how it compares to us just yet, maybe next year :) My biggest takeaway is they are U.S. only and we are able to take on clients from around the world for a flat fee of $2.99 - one of our biggest assets. I could go on and on, but check out our website or reach out to us on live chat with any other questions you have.
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:58:36


I'm a bit biased here, but I'd prefer if you funded an investment account with DriveWealth :) We offer a flat $2.99 commission on all of our products (stocks and ETFs), so transferring out to another brokerage wouldn't be cost effective. Your call though.


You're missing a DriveWealth account. Ha! Seriously though, there are no fees when depositing with Bitcoins, there is only a $50 minimum when depositing funds and no limits on withdrawals. You can always read more from our [support center](

Wow, very generous. Thanks!

Thank you and welcome aboard! As I mentioned above, we are focused on bringing affordable investing to everyone, not just the US. Any problems or questions (or even compliments), let us know.

You're welcome!
