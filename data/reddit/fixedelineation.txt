Bitcoin is still recovery from gox. Why would you think it’s over valued here when it should be at least 25k?

Places that want to accept bitcoin will run lightening nodes so that their users can have the option. A user complaining about slow expensive transactions who had the option to transact on the lightening network is ignorant or a bch shill.

It’s network effect, not tech. Facebook has garbage technology. It should be worth far less/over taken, but it is king and growing because it’s network grows despite it sucking so bad. People are afraid of bitcoin, it is wild and crazy, but every time they see it dip it comes back and is way more expensive. Those people are future buyers just waiting to get in. Based on the size of its network and the growth rate of the network, bitcoin is way undervalued. 
As far as tech goes, the only thing that matters is decentralization. Coins that don’t have that are dead ends or are things that could be done much better with existing centralized systems. Bitcoin is an enabler of a future that most people have never imagined, but that radically transformed future is coming regardless of people’s limited imaginations.

Forks are part of open source projects. If simply raising the block size is all bitcoin needs then bcash should do well. People paying attention know that the code is constantly being improved. Satoshi wasn’t some sort of god and so there are significant improvements that have happened because the devs priority is security. 
I think that if all bitcoin did was raise the block size, then we could expect it to fade away. The lightning network(very much in satoshi’s grand vision) will make bitcoin a threat to the very existence of coins that are only good for fast cheap payments. Rsk is in beta and I expect eth to take a major hit once this comes online. 
As far as dominance is concerned you are basically pointing out that it’s a good time to go long on bitcoin. Or don’t and continue down the path being forged by the shrill crybaby and fake satoshi.

There are various time frames that the devs are working under. Short term fixes that don’t add any long term value don’t get priority when consensus can’t be reached on those issues. Refining the code and adding secondary layers to bitcoin have much better long term returns, and are more important to do now with a relatively small ecosystem.

I’d argue that high fees are evidence of bitcoin’s extreme desirability. It’s also important to note that eventually the network will have to survive on fees alone. Bitcoin is currently answering that question, and increasingly people are becoming more confident that in the absence of a meaningful block reward, people will pay for decentralized security.

I don’t disagree, but cars have been around for over 100 years. The problem has been with them from the start.

Hmm looks like people are actually using litecoin and fees spiked. Prior to this fees and speed where all better. If no one is using bcash, which it appears that few are,  it will never have any of the issues bitcoin is currently dealing with.  So fine if I want ultra low fees and I want transactions I’ll use doge.... the fastest cheapest widely accepted crypto on the planet. 
You want to have a reading comprehension contest? Is that what you are driving at? The over riding theme of the bitcoin white paper is decentralization and consensus building. Being lead around by a tantrum prone ego maniac doesn’t exactly shout decentralized consensus. Having to rely on bitcoin core for big fixes doesn’t add any confidence to what vercash is all about.
Segwit doesn’t ruin anything but Jihan Wu’s mining advantage.
Have you read the core developer’s road map for scaling? Have you invested any time into understanding the process of developing bitcoin? Bch doesn’t fix anything long term? All it does is bloat the blockchain(or would of anyone was using it and filling blocks....but no one is so the block size is hmmm oh look about 1mb).
Bitcoin will face major challenges in the not too distant future. External forces will try to kill it. Forces much more qualified than jihan wu and roger ver, so I guess thanks is due to you. You are playing your part in hardening bitcoin for the tough road it faces. Also eventually bitcoin must be able to survive on fees alone. So far only real bitcoin has demonstrated that people are willing to pay high fees to transact on its network. This is a good sign even if it is over exaggerated by the artificial spam attacks that clog the men pool and the anti bitcoin mining cartel who are enriching themselves with their fork.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:05:23
Why wouldn’t you just use litecoin, bcash has no point.

Are you talking about doge coin? Cause doge is both faster and cheaper than bcash...as is litecoin. A haphazard block doubling and rejection of tech upgrades doesn’t make bcash superior to anything.

The guy is an unstable fuckboy. I’m pretty happy with my investments....although that’s not really why I’m here. Unstoppable decentralized consensus systems not ego projects that do nothing to advance the systems. Bch is unsustainable, and will have to become inflationary to keep paying miners. Btc is trying to work out the economics of a fee secured store of value. If I want centralized celebrity inflation Coins I’ll buy eth and hope vitalik doesn’t OD on meth before I cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:25
I suppose the decentralized exchange concepts will get a little more attention now. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:24:15
No bcash has no purpose. Eventually it will have to fork to add inflation since it won’t have any sort of reasonable fee structure to take over when block reward ends.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:34:44

@_date: 2017-12-21 02:51:17
Centralized authority controls it. It is no longer worthwhile. Bitcoins value isn’t its ability to pay for stuff. I can do that with visa or PayPal. Bitcoins value is the decentralized consensus network.
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:54:04
no idea what will do best. I like ATMOS and went in hard this past couple weeks, not because I expect it to do the best, but because it has an actual use case and is bringing innovation.  It is weak on marketing and low cap so I never expect much, but it has nothing but buyers below this level and so its a safe bet in my opinion. Once the coins are tied to the platform, things will be very clear as to hy the coin has value. Coins with nothing but a nice website and a gui wallet but no point or no need for a decentralized system in my opinion are garbage. ETH, for example has limited use since using it means paying fees to participate. this is the opposite of what you want.
I like privacy coins, but since ATMOS is issuing a pegged anon token I sold off some of my XMR and ZCASH related holdings . I also think EOS will be a good buy, so I've held onto the bag which was mostly bought at a dollar  a piece.

Hostile take over as it shares the same algo the hashing power is a limited resource. Bcash supporting miners switch to bcash and snap the bitcoin network. This creates a mempool back log.

For all the innovation that this community likes to crow about it, if it can't attract new non technical users it will continue to be just a play ground for hedge funds and techno gold bugs.

That is a major technical hurdle and a flaw all crypto currency must deal with if they actually want to be used as money.

Oh I'm sorry I was operating under the assumption people would actually be using bch, and blocks would be increasingly full. If all it's used for is a way to sabotage btc and the block average stays super low, then sure the blockchain won't be too hard to manage. But then what the fuck is the point of 8mb when all it is using is 9kb? I'm still not sure wtf the point of bch is in general, plenty of alt coins exist which attempt to make actual innovations. I could use doge coin for gods sakes if I wanted low fees and fast transactions, and it's likely more accepted and more well known than bch at this point...certainly more well liked.

Exactly. It is the bullshit that bitcoin has endured that adds to its value. The fact that it isn't centrally controlled the way eth is makes it a much more resilient technology. 
While there are many interesting tech advancements happening in the space, bitcoin is in a position to copy anything worthwhile once it is deemed useful and safe to do so by the network. The consensus that has governed bitcoin is a big part of its value.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:32:07
Bch is a centralized altcoin. Bitcoin is the most secure most used crypto. You cannot compare the two. The fact that 1mb was used is not arbitrary. Bitcoin may have started without a block limit, but in those days  it did not see average block sizes much over 200-300k. So no it was not tested. It was much smaller, worthless and not at all subject to the scrutiny or manipulation it handles today. Larger blocks will limit who runs a full node and will destroy decentralization and with it the value proposition of bitcoin.

Decentralized currency getting discussed on centralized censorship prone forums is always a good look. 
But yes you are right moving discussions to a superior platform is the answer. Thankfully that’s being built. While it will rustle many jimmies here that it’s not built on bitcoin(tx costs kill user experience), the fact that it offers reasonable censorship resistance, is completely self hostable, and can run on any blockchain or several concurrently means that it will be the most censorship resistance unstoppable communication platform the world has ever seen. On top of which it won’t require crypto to use. 
The idea that a superior user empowering scheme for moderation would threaten anyone’s little kingdom or make them feel like taking sides in a turf war is comical. Moderators do this for free, and wield a lot of power. That fact should concern everyone who understands misaligned incentives.

Most bch lovers hate segwit because they aren’t real people. Sock puppet accounts that have always fought hard against segwit to protect the mining cartels. 
Layer 2 and 3 solutions are a no brainer if you need to have a hyper secure decentralize system be usable for tiny transactions. I personally don’t think you need to replace the current centralized payment systems to make bitcoin valuable so I don’t demand that segwit be included but I don’t think the move to bigger blocks makes any sense at this point.

If there were no spam attacks there would be no problem. The miners are  the group most able to afford to clog the network with spam. Why would we change bitcoin to their vision based on a problem they are causing. This is a hostile take over attempt. Step one control the code and brand name. Step 2 total centralization.

The average volatility is reducing as bitcoin grows. Also bitcoin isn’t just a payment method. It is decentralized governance and trustless value transfer. It doesn’t have to compete against fiat with the same sort of properties because it had unique ones that give it an advantage.

So you think a decentralized database is something banks need? There is no there there. They don’t need to use blockchain, they are simply trying to derail the bitcoin hype by adopting a piece of the technology.
Bitcoin is valuable because it lives outside of the traditional controls of the banking cartels and the manipulations of politicians. The blockchain is only a technological marvel because of the large decentralized network called bitcoin which operates on it.
Don’t confuse things.

False. Security has a cost. Bitcoin uses the energy it needs to provide an alternative decentralized system  , censorship resistant value transfer that is highly secure. No other system comes close without major sacrifices in centralization or being prone to censorship.

There are at most 3 providers in major markets, some markets have only 1. There is no free market. 
A fully decentralized mesh network where providers of bandwidth are rewarded utilizing a proof of bandwidth scheme could provide baseline connectivity that could eventually replace the internet with something unstoppable and uncensored.

You would have to buy in cash from localbitcoin to have zero trace that you entered the crypto market. However you could buy from say Coinbase and then tumble your coins, or buy an anonymous currency like xmr, zcash, zclassic or whatever and then be untraceable from that point.
Or find a clean friend to buy for you and transfer to your wallet, tumble coins and then you are only linked by your friend. 
Depends on your end goals. You could also sell something of value online for bitcoin. Bitpremiere is an auction site that would facilitate that.

Bitcoin is consensus driven. Eth is a centralized dictatorship with slick marketing, hence eth can move quickly. When the dao disaster hit, the eth foundation people were quick to shout theft/hack. Anyone could see they were just protecting their own funds that they entrusted to a smart contract they didn't understand. It wasn't theft or a hack. It was operating exactly as it was supposed to. Unstoppable code. Remember that? Then they forked. Code is no longer law. The premise of eth is dead.
This fact may not matter to banksters and corporate stooges, but it is the key reason why bitcoin is special. This long debate is healthy and proves how secure bitcoin is from tampering. To fuck eth over or control it one simple has to blackbag VB and the game is over.

Ethereum is not a more advanced bitcoin. It is a centralized platform for running poorly coded apps. It has been a series of disasters with eth and besides from being a good way to pump Scammy icos it has no purpose. The capabilities that eth potentially has are also potentially available in the bitcoin ecosystem, so it is in danger of bitcoin successfully evolving and making it irrelevant. I can see eth/etc parity eventually.
Bitcoin has proven to robustly grow and resist centralization. The longer it does the more powerful it becomes as a store of value.

People sell bitcoin when they need dollars or think the price is going to drop. 
As far as bitcoins becoming too valuable for everyday purchases it is simply a matter of using other terms. If satoshis become pennies, then you could say coffee is 5000 satoshis which isn't particularly hard to deal with. But in reality bitcoin isn't money yet, it has become a store of value but will need some more maturity to start resembling currency we are used to dealing with.
