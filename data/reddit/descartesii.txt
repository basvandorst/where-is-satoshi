When he released his essay that "Bitcoin is dead", the price of Bitcoin dropped to around 380.  The media believed him so it scared the non-believers away.  Then the price has steadily risen since then.  
@_date: 2016-04-27 14:53:01
just don't sell.  stay bullish.
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:04:17
I don't think he cared about the money. He just wanted to change the world.

Your rent is expensive as BTC increases in value.  you should be the hodler for life.

GBTC trades in the OTC market so many funds can't purchase it. Since it's on the OTC market, there's very limited information on GBTC since there's essentially no reporting requirements. Some hedge funds may have bid up the price to create the premium in the price.  When a Bitcoin ETF is approved, I agree with VT_Dude that pension funds in addition to mutual funds will be able to invest in it.  Also, GBTC has an annual expense ratio of 2%.  I would assume the ETF will be cheaper.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:25:46
it's true.  Skynet is not anonymous.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:06:42
like selling all his BTC
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:04:10
are you saying if Hearn starts buying BTC, we get out?
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:18:10
You can thank me when BTC hits $5,000.  lol
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:07:11
and also the Bitcoin meetups.  let's hope the media starts doing a better job reporting on it.  Not all users of BTC are unsavory characters.
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:48:54
I think you missed a zero.  did you mean $100,000?
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:34:00
When will Forbes or Bloomberg place Satoshi Nakamoto on their Billionaire list next to "El Chapo"?
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:02:37
at least $200 billion but he's not anonymous.
@_date: 2016-03-25 19:58:08
It's trading in a tight range.  If it breaks resistance on the upside, it could cause a good upward move.
@_date: 2017-02-18 15:02:01
If an ETF is approved, GBTC should trade at NAV and not below.  With that said, I think there's a consensus that the Bitcoin price will increase because the demandwill increase.  This will be caused by institutions that couldn't invest in it before such as mutual funds and pension funds.  Since BTC is non-inflationary with a fixed supply, an increase in demand will naturally push the price up.  Back to Economics 101.
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:00:49
It's always important to understand the incentives/motivations when someone says Bitcoin is dead.  Here's my two cents. Bitcoin is super resilient and here to stay.
@_date: 2016-03-25 19:54:47
I believe Ledger and Trezor are both good options for cold storage.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:34:43

Are you getting discounts when you use Bitcoin?  I personally think it's undervalued which is the reason I'm hoarding it.

BTC price will go up because the SEC decision does not affect the viability of Bitcoin.  It's still alive and well, not like Mike Hearn's prediction.  The SEC will realize this was a mistake.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:06:18
There a great interview with the Winklevii in the podcast Unchained.  Agreed, they have done a great job with BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:29:34
They are too busy downloading porn to understand how Bitcoin really works.
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:20:34
The media doesn't care about this decision as much as the Winklevoss one so it might not affect the price.  However, if they do whack the price down, I'll be ready to buy.

Bitcoin has never died.  It's gotten knocked down but it always gets back up to fight.  Satoshi is a powerful god.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:09:36
Based on their language, why would they approve Solidx?  They see a great risk in the fact Bitcoin is traded on unregulated exchanges.  They need people who understand Bitcoin working there.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:17:38
Does that mean Satoshi is our god?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:13:30
maybe you are Satoshi!  you had Bitcoins before they were created.  
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:20:37
When the market cap of Bitcoin is in the trillions, you'll be a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:15:33
I think the SEC is not going to make an official statement today.  The deadline passes and it automatically becomes approved.  I believe they take this option so they are not giving the ETF their stamp of approval.  All signs point to this.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:28:23
I didn't say you would be rich. Only that you will be a millionaire.  
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:39:17
Does this mean if there's no response by 5pm today, BTC price will start going up?
@_date: 2016-03-11 17:36:45
The crazy part is I think that number is relatively low for NYC.

Do you get discounts for using the Shift debit card?

He's a good market timer.  He sold close to the low of the year.
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:57:23
I think he's kicking himself for selling his Bitcoins so low.

i'm waiting till the top 10 coins in market cap are all some version of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:10:12
you hit the nail on its head.

@_date: 2017-04-05 18:58:36
or an AI?
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:50:34
If they mention ICO, it increases the valuation even more.
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:04:32
I would argue that if your address was ever exposed that it's linked to you, then your anonymity disappears.  With crypto's like Zcash, you don't have that risk.
I totally agree with that the media is incorrectly portraying a negative perspective on it.  They fail to report that trillions of dollars are laundered every year using fiat.  If they dig into the stats, I'm sure it's a small minority using Bitcoin for illegal means. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:24:38
I want to know where he hid the Bitcoins.  Is the safe in Japan?
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:35:54
exactly. you hit the nail on its head.  the global nature of it and the multiple use cases makes this worth much more than gold.
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:20:44
It can happen and it will.  I bet you 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:44:45
That sounds better but I think the price will be higher than that in the longer term.
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:05:08
probably came from early 2018.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:14:32
You are correct.  I think the exchange didn't send a high fee so it eventually cleared after a few hours.  He was freaking out.  He wouldn't tell me how many bitcoins he sent.  I got too many calls from him.  I thought he entered the wrong address.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:34:07
exactly but I think it'll be worth even more in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:02:11
that could be plot twist. and Litecoin surpasses BTC in market cap.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:34:25
I agree it's more like 1994.  In 10 years, our entire world is going to be different, in a good way.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:30:39
Why aim so low?  I don't think the betting works like the Price is Right.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:19:25
exactly.  proves he's not a great investor but still a billionaire.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:08:11
for 13mil each?
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:36:47
Do I tell him they are gone?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:54:58
Cuban is not a great investor.  I would like to see his stats on Shark Tank.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:22:49
I'm riding it till it hits 1mil each.  Then I might sell some
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:11:35
I bet you all the "stolen" BTC from Mt Gox sits on a cold wallet in his possession.  He'll be a billionaire if he's ever released from jail.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:27:58
I heard most of his money is in cash.  he allocated 10% for shark tank investments.  let's admit it, we are all jealous we aren't living his life.
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:21:54
Why do people still listen to him?  no one really knows.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:12:24
Now I know he's an investing idiot. I remember when he said Facebook was overvalued at $40.  He keeps his net worth in cash.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:10:25
I just talked to my friend.  He sent it from GDAX.  Does that work the same as Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:51:48
I told my friends to buy at 1,500 when everyone was saying it was the top.

When are they going to make a new Back to the Future movie where Biff goes back to 2009?  He buys a whole bunch of bitcoins and becomes a multi-trillionaire.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:48:26
yup, he didn't send a high enough fee so it took a while.  I laughed at him when he told me the good news.  He's relieved.  He was panicking for a few hours.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:22:56
He did it about an hour ago.  Should I be able to see it on blockchain.info even if it's unconfirmed?
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:26:19
If that amount is hurting your wallet, feel free to send it to my address.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:22:02
