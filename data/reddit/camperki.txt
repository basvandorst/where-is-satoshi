i had a similar problem. I've lost my wallet two weeks ago. So i had no cards or id to withdraw money from my bank account but online banking was working. Within one and a half day i sepa'ed fiat to kraken to buy bitcoins and traded them on localbitcoins for cash.

yeah, their system is so fucked up. when I login to paypal they want me to enter my bank account details which they already have for 3 years or so now. so if I enter the account details the website says: account already connected to paypal account or something like that and I get the form for entering my bank details again. very funny
