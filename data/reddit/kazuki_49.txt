I can't believe I'm being downvoted for suggesting people not to hire hitmans over the Internet. This sub-reddit is SICK.
@_date: 2015-05-13 02:50:52
time for plan M.
@_date: 2015-05-14 06:28:14
yeah, I agree with you.
@_date: 2015-05-18 06:36:46
Since when Bitcoin became Microsoft? 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:51:26
Monero = HTTPS
Bitcoin = HTTP
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:58:11
trow in some moneroj and you are good to go.
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:09:21
Its a nightmare waiting to happen, no one will hear you because they all want to get rich doing nothing, the solution already exist and it cannot be found in Bitcoin or its clones.
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:32:09
Other blockchains are interesting too (maybe even more than Bitcoin), touché.
I'm not going to downgrade my intellectual affinity with technologies because I want everyone buying the blockchain I'm in, thats old-world stuff.
@_date: 2015-05-28 14:57:38
indeed, a true visionary...
@_date: 2015-05-25 02:02:46
haha did satoshi used his BTC to buy anything online? Its like saying the NSA do not spy on anyone on Mars.
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:17:47
Or, dunno, just dont try to hire hitmans over the Internet! 
@_date: 2015-05-18 01:00:01
technically it is, it also needs a HARD fork to solve.
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:39:28
Too bad no one spend their Bitcoins thanks to the Gollum effect of inherently deflationary nature, we have to wait the smart people wake up to Monero so we can finally have an all-around-useful electronic cash in the Internet.

@_date: 2015-05-18 23:21:14
fluffyponyza, your honesty and integrity displayed in your post was a huge positive point in my gravitation towards Monero a few months ago. As long you are still in the core team I feel Monero is in good hands.
@_date: 2015-05-14 05:26:53
so you rather burn the world down ? lol
@_date: 2015-05-24 22:47:08
Wait a moment, who went public first?
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:24:25
we need cryptonight
@_date: 2015-05-28 02:27:53
No, its FOD.
@_date: 2015-05-23 05:38:55
I dont think there are many people on earth that fully understand it, it is heavy math stuff in C code but mainly implementation of ring signatures is based on "old, exceedingly well-tested cryptography and code from SUPERCOP / libsodium / NaCL" so backdoor is very unlikely, it has no SHA-256 and uses a really cryptographic safe curve, unlike Bitcoin.
Its like cash but electronically, I dont see how we don't need it.
thanks for answering.
moreover, I agree with you here: 
Monero is slightly inflationary.

yeah thats what technically happened, as I have read it at least.

And that's exactly why they are all "promoted", they are not even remotely something that can compete with Bitcoin on the long run, you'll not hear about the real deal so easily.
@_date: 2015-05-23 08:08:53
lol thanks for reminding me how much Monero today is like Bitcoin in 2010
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:50:54
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:18:38
XD its funny because its true.
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:34:25


well I'm glad I'm wrong then, right..?
@_date: 2015-05-31 06:34:46
Thats how I view and hope Bitcoin to remain, I agree with everything you said.
ps: for those who think Bitcoin has no future as a "Digital Gold" you are deluded! The first crypto has a tremendous network effect and a digital gold has no competition! In other hand a digital cash has thousands of better token system already. 
Wake up before it is too late.
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:47:57
No, as an example, you can say whatever you want the fact is plain and simple Bitcoin can be tracked and are not fungible, you keep lying the blow-back will be only bigger. BTW since when Bitcoin was made to cater "those in the gov", lmao, that already signals the disaster waiting for us.
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:17:56

nooooo, he can dump all his bitcoins and keep the sweet fiat, sending the entire eco-system to hell. Jesus you guys are dense.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:41:48
I hope everyone in the world is able to afford such luxuries, not just a tiny btc elite.

*the plot thickens*
@_date: 2015-05-18 07:10:02
You can say you do not like Litecoin, me neither but I dont think its not legit, for something not be legit it either needs to be broken technically or had some kind of scam running in the past/present.
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:27:47
I would like to know what his opinion on Monero..
@_date: 2015-05-17 15:01:08
2 
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:18:38
haha yes everyone that dont think Bitcoin cures cancer is a buttcoiner. No Bitcoin cant change it is set in stone, Satoshi probably release this as a beta test and you guys took him too serious. There is better stuff now like Monero.
@_date: 2015-05-10 06:17:44
you're goddamn right.
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:42:48
You would feel the same had you lost the private keys for 1 million bitcoins
@_date: 2015-05-14 00:14:07
Yep, the problem is if bitcoin do not find a way to scale, and if we are going to keep using the bitcoin blockchain, coinbase-like services will become obligatory so, tighten your belts, this 1984-nightmare is just starting...

The Fungi from Yuggoth.
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:32:22


but i see your point.
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:53:08
Thats what I have been thinking to myself lately, Gavin is not only the only core dev that want to go ahead and forcefully tear Bitcoin apart, literally, but he is the one in the core team that most likely has ties to the establishment, I would sound crazy if the guy wasn't actually invited to a secret chat with the CIA! And right after that Satoshi disappears and... boom, Bitcoin flourishes as eco-system as the gov ''green-light'' it and VC money pours in. Peter Todd is right too, if this fork goes ahead and the Bitcoin network effect somehow magically survives intact, it will be open to brand new regulatory applications.
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:34:01
Not going to happen, some people don't like being slaves to any system, the bitcoin blockchain included, if you think there is one blockchain to rule it all there could even be wars because of that.
@_date: 2015-05-19 08:32:47
its worse - its exactly how other close-minded people treat Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-28 02:03:10

It was hacked when almost no one cared about Bitcoin, it virtually does not count anymore.
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:07:38
Its like every other argument ppl here use to dupe unaware readers: "Bitcoin is anonymous" (trying to appeal to privacy-conscious ppl), when it actually isn't, "Bitcoins can be divided to the infinity!" (trying to appeal to the ppl that think being deflationary is a problem).
@_date: 2015-05-28 02:07:00
@_date: 2015-05-26 01:39:33
this is really cool.

is the jelly to our bitcoin bread. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:59:17
cryptonight is what satoshi always dreamed to bitcoin remain.
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:08:52
its the only decentralized way of doing so, the fact the nothing comes close to Satoshi's release of Bitcoin should tell you that. Not saying Bitcoin blockchain is the best blockchain for a currency, thats Monero right now.

@_date: 2015-05-22 02:56:10
don't worry, there is no public info gone from that website, see archive.is and archive.org ;)
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:23:03
lets not ignore the bitcoin killer in the room, now the btc community is going back to mark fucking karpeles as "reference"? biggest LOL ever.
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:48:21
lol you are clueless aren't you, thats not what I meant.
@_date: 2015-05-18 09:46:45
true, I dont trust it one *bit*, I'm on the original truecrypt.ch until a reputable fork carries the torch.
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:38:00
sure, this being the I will give you the presumption of being right.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:36:16
You are right, Bitcoin is my hedge.
@_date: 2015-05-24 03:23:19
it is true but it was willy that led the 2013 rally.
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:26:38
yeah blockchain security, it comes from the hashrate mainly from profit-seekers, so its all tied to Bitcoin price in the end, and if there are better blockchains for other purposes you cant make everyone buy Bitcoin, there will be a point of saturation in an inherently deflationary system, a point where Bitcoin becomes the status quo and threat individual freedom and wealth.
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:25:17
Now I finally get why some bitcoiners say bitcoin is anonymous!
@_date: 2015-05-25 03:47:40


that there can be black and white bitcoin and blacklisting CAN happen as result.
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:49:32
You can already see this happening, I think Lightning Network is the first honest approach to expanding Bitcoin and projects like it are vital to btc survival, being able to do hundreds of thousands more transaction a day will inherently appreciate the Bitcoin network itself.
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:20:28
You are right in more dimensions people here will ever be willing to admit
@_date: 2015-05-12 02:36:37
And Bitcoin is not even the best digital cash anymore.
@_date: 2015-05-14 00:04:05
competition is good, Bitcoin is not too big to fail.
@_date: 2015-05-25 22:55:14
Everyone in Bitcoin is, indirectly, because he own hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins, he has the power to send you all to Zimbabwe.
 Hence the constant assliking.
@_date: 2015-05-10 06:12:27
In fact, it is NOT totally fungible, this means its nothing like cash at all, kwanijml is right, it doesnt matter what any whitepaper says.
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:07:20
Timing is everything. I dont even think Bitcoin is the best form of digital cash anymore but it cant keep at 1mb forever nor it should be turned into a problem now.....
@_date: 2015-05-28 09:09:50
Sounds like you have your head screwed on sir.
@_date: 2015-05-24 01:57:16
Mine is where it says "For now, please pay the February $10k mininum to: (Redacted BTC addy)"
With Monero you can publish your same address everywhere and no one can know your transactions or how many coins you have.
@_date: 2015-05-25 01:45:21
eeh, you can't really know a diamond is a bloody one, they can easily disappear here and appear anywhere else as "legit", same can't happen with bitcoin, its an incorruptible, permanent and public database, and it will be used against you.
@_date: 2015-05-31 06:48:42
don't forget mona.
@_date: 2015-05-21 20:24:53
I'm glad to read you are sane. I didn't said he would, I said it enables him, and that is dangerous enough because we are not talking about Internet and cat picture but irreversibly transferable tokens.
@_date: 2015-05-18 06:58:37
How exactly is Litecoin not legit? lol
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:08:01
er wrong, it was just an example, Bitcoin enables everyone, including the guy next door to financially stalk you: 


People like you will be culprit of trowing us into a new dark-age.

it's a personal resolution, do not mind: 
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:13:12
thats sadly true, but we have Monero, so not all is lost!
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:38:44
Don't be so hard on yourself, all you are doing is making us not use your website :)
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:01:13
does it support Monero?
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:37:13
Your word is gold sir, I take back the shithisft remarks :D

@_date: 2015-04-06 01:15:29
Make no mistake, Monero is a financial weapon, conceived by some of our most elite geniuses. The math, technologies, and theory for its existence sparkled to life among the Fight Club culture of the late 90's, but it would be over a decade (2014) before the time had finally come to deploy the damned thing.
How amusing that even as Tyler Durden mused about resetting the debt record on screen, there was a real product in existence/development that would do exactly that. I wouldn't even be surprised if Monero were referred to as 'Project Mayhem' at some point.
For those nations that foolishly try to ban Monero, they are wasting their time. They might as well try to ban the common cold. There is only one thing they can do to fight Monero, and they're so shortsighted they haven't even considered it as an option.
That would be to start their own, state-sponsored, rival Cryptocurrency. However the window for the viability of that is fast closing / already passed. Monero has a 11 months lead, even if a clone were copy/pasted today. And even if such a stunt were attempted, the legitimacy that Monero would gain at that moment would be enormous.
It's essential that the true creators of Monero maintain plausible deniability until global adoption has already occured. This ensures that other nations and players don't unnecessarily prolong/hamper the process.
Any intelligent person who studies the history and facts can only arrive at the same conclusion.
Monero is unstoppable. It's fuel is sheer human greed, and that same fuel will power the protocol through tier after tier of global finance. The dollar will crash before 2020, and though I don't believe anyone can predict exactly when that will happen, Monero will continue to ensure that the 'good guys' remain in control.
The technological portion is done. That ended the moment Monero was released into the public. Now it's just a social and informational war, controlling the opinions of the population and ensuring a slow trickle of government and corporate adoption.
Monero is posed as some neckbeard, anti-establishment movement, but it's not. Not even close. The common pleb lives so far down the informational ladder they can't even grasp the true nature of their world: play your xbox, eat your Doritos, and don't worry about what the left hand is doing. There is nothing that can be realistically done at this point: Monero wins, and the only winning move?
You better get your ass on the Monero standard as soon as possible.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:02:52
Monero devs did one from scratch in few months.
@_date: 2015-04-15 19:31:04
shadowcash is a scam and a joke. I'm glad Monero is not and never will be shadowcash
btw can you retards stop stalking me with this shadowcash BS, its making me hate it more every day, I'm not interested in bobsurplus scams.

Monero wallets don't have this problem because they only store the private key and never grow in size so you can set them read-only forever :)
