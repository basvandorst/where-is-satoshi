Get 1 BTC before anything else
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:59:23
It probably will

Bitcoin on Twitter is Bitcoin, also represented by BTC. 
BitcoinCash is BCH, also called BitcoinTrash.

Trump has turned the media into Jerry Springer Politics. It is entertainment now. 
I'm kidding about the literal scripting tho. But if it were ... why would they script in awkward racist questions? To keep us divided. To keep us fearful. To keep us dependent on them.

by the end of it people will think they're stupid for thinking the difference 9k and 15k mattered

I know that :) Someone who bought in last week doesn't.

Probably scripted q+a. The US Government is corrupt, it needs to be replaced. The fact that we can't only proves the point of what is necessary.

Far less than 21 million can be in the club at this current rate
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:11:37
Would you buy if it dropped to 1k tho?
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:18:24
Apparently they did

As opposed to illicit use cases of the US Dollar, the most abused currency in the world? 
Why would they acknowledge decentralized nature of Bitcoin? It threatens the current structure of power and influence in the US + Global economy. They want to keep everything centralized.

Did you put your special wire code in on the instructions?

Trump's war on journalism -- if it even passes for that today -- is disturbing to say the least.
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:25:22
There are options to transfer money over. When you select the wire transfer option, it gives you a code that you must include in the memo of the wire, or else Coinbase won't know which account to put that wired money into.

Very funny lol

i haven't used gemini yet so i can't speak from experience but i've heard their fee is just .25% from someone who mainly uses gemini 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:48:38
Totally agree -- it's us (the "average crypto people" -- not unimaginably wealthy, new, growing wealth, etc) and BTC vs the elites and BCH. 
They really think they can just jerk us around. They will soon learn otherwise. 
Fuck Coinbase/GDAX the ONLY reason I wired more money there today is because I'm not set up elsewhere to go buy ETH LTC and BTC in bulk. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:50:08
No one should buy into BCH because that will play into the hands of the deceitful manipulators trying to play the market. 
It's us vs. them.... who do you side with? BTC is the people. BCH is the elites. 
Also, fuck Coinbase.

Yush! I will try to think some up but wouldn't post them on this sub. Probably r/cryptocurrency ... More shit post friendly there I think, tho not necessarily by design

They said it. Plus it's absolutely beautiful there. You can get some of the best food, wine, and service in the world for very cheap. The US dollar goes very far there.

So I just had a conversation with a colleague who bought 2 LTC at the ATH. He wanted to know what to do with them. I told him HODL until after halving. Seemed hard to get him to understand halving. Thinks that all coins get cut in half -- I explained very simply, to no avail.
So now he wants advice on crypto. I said "focus on getting 1 whole BTC, and before you do that, don't pay attention to anything else." That was not acceptable lol. He had a list of weed coins all worth under 5 cents he wanted me to identify which was going to be $100... \*facepalm\*
