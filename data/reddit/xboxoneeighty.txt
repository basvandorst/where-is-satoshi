Maybe not the public, but the people in Bitcoin did.

Vaultoro is the dude. Even if only for their handling of the KYC implementation

I keep hearing that. Maybe I should have kept looking. I'm sitting at $43k in a place I find morally reprehensible. East coast

Met her at Beltway, she seemed like a cool cat. They made a good choice. Actually raises my opinion of them more than it does my opinion of her.

After Iran, US learned it's lesson on being blatant about it. So I wouldn't be surprised if he was installed; they'd just choose someone most people would like, that also serves US interests.

That's one hell of a reason to get off of Coinbase

Ah shucks it looks like I missed out on the top tier. Still a good deal, I'm going to be buying xbox bucks in the future anyway, might as well do it...
1. ...with a discount (even if it's just ~5%, discounts are nonexistent for xbox bucks)
2. ...with a few Amazon bucks
3. ...while paying someone in bitcoin, a luxury I would like to have some day
edit: looks like I still got in on the $15 cards. Surprised more people aren't taking this up. 
BTW during the checkout, it said I would be getting a $5 card, so possible glitch there somewhere.
