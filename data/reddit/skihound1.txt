No its still me haha, I’ve had this account for a while, I’m just not that active.
It was on mycelium and I didn’t really know to much about the fees and it didn’t really show me what the transfer fee was, or I just didn’t look too much into it. I’ve got a screenshot I can dm but I don’t know what info I should be blacking out or remitting.

Thanks for looking into it, yeah it was there very quickly. And what do you mean handcraft? Like did I set up custom parameters for the transaction, or did I make this transaction to be a very high rate? Basically all I did was scan my friends qr code and then I transferred 20 bucks, the next day I went in to see what my balance was, and it reads a zero balance. I guess this will teach me to check for the speed and amount I’m paying for a transfer. But from what I understand is that there isn’t really a way to recoup this right? Basically just a lesson learned?

What would help? Sorry, I was gifted an original 20 a while ago and I just wanted to pass it on, I haven’t done any real research or anything to further my knowledge. I appreciate the help!
