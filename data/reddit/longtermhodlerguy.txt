Have an upvote from me, i don't get why people see shitcoins as anything more than a bitcoin test network which doesn't even use bitcoin as currency.

Because all we need is $1,000,000 per bitcoin.  
$1,000,000 per bitcoin, just 3x market cap of gold for gold on steroids.  
$1,000,000 per bitcoin, or about the size of the offshore banking market.  
$1,000,000 per bitcoin you heard it here first $1,000,000 per bitcoin.  
$1,000,000 per bitcoin you are reading it again $1,000,000 per bitcoin.

Wow, we finally got some intelligent posters back on r/bitcoin or was it just burried under all the troll noise?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:30:27
Of course, let's just double the blocksize so coinbase and bitpay and all the other lazy bitcoin leechers don't have to innovate. Then once we are at $50 fees again let's just cry again until we have 4mb blocks, and 8mb blocks, and 16mb blocks, because you know, it is a lot easier than actually doing some real scaling work.  
Sure 2mb might be ok, but who knows, i am sure we would run into problems with for example 16mb blocks. That would be 800gb per year, not sure if SSD prices will come down enough and then you need super fast SSDs because you won't be able to store the UTXO in ram anymore.  
Not to mention getting 16mb blocks through TOR or the chinese firewall.  
I prefer to be sure bitcoin will stay decentralized, where all you do is "assume".

All it depends on is if ASICs become cheap enough to produce compared to energy storage systems IMHO. But if the world wants to switch to 100% renewables we will always need huge oversupply that can be used to instantly convert to bitcoin.

Maybe your understanding of bitcoin is fucked up, how on earth do you even think you are more knowledgeable about technical facts than the core devs who you claim have a fucked up ideology? Get your facts straight!

Wasn't that the plan anyway? To undermine governments?  
"Bitcoin is like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Bitcoin attracts inside men to act as covert saboteurs. There have long been predictions from both bitcoiners and naysayers of impending government attacks, but I think there is a possibility that Bitcoin could win without suffering much resistance."

With people like you i wonder if you even used the bitcoin core client recently. I do and i know it barely works for me sometimes for the things i want to do with a 150gb+ blockchain and 1mb per block. Sometimes network is a limiting factor, at least if you are not always online with your node. For initial sync CPU is usually a problem. And don't even try to run it on a HDD instead of a SSD.
  
When initial sync takes 3-6 hours again on an average $1000 PC and average $30 internet, and SSDs fast enough to store the UTXO on SSD instead of RAM, and confirming one 1mb block takes far less than a second, we can talk about increasing the blocksize IMHO.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:37:28
At least i know that satoshi thought fraud proofs would be easier than they are, so actually everyone should run a full node!

I'm in bitcoin to be my own bank, but not everyone needs to be his own bank all the time. Looking at my last 100 transactions, 80 if them i would have done on Coinbase if in exchange for some lost security it would have saved me $100's or $1000's of dollars of fees.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:38:51
No one wants a top-down authority, just some better coordination like other open source projects have. Linux for example, there are so many paid open source developers because many many companys could not work without linux. And there is not a single crypto company that would have any market without bitcoin.

I don't know, but it is funny i had the same idea when i posted this lol  
We need more bitcoin artists!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:14:30
Maybe because it has been discussed to death already, but we have to fight against an army spreading misinformation. So here i am, posting because i don't want newbies to get sucked into believing altcoin pumpers and scammers. There are good technical reasons to act very carefully with raising the blocksize, of you don't get that, i don't have the time to explain it to you over and over again.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:58:25
If bitcoin as an experiment and idea fails, why do you think altcoins will be a good investment?  The core devs and people like andreas, Satoshi, and great thinkers like Nick Szabo, many of the original cypherpunks from the 90s, 100's of hardcore libertarians who actually understand money way more than the average person and many groups i forgot put 8+ years if deep thoughts into bitcoin and you think a roger ver and some random chinese dude will outperform those thoughts? Just lol.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:28:28
Why? Offshore banking is a 17 trillion market. No need for offshore banking if all you want is to buy hot dogs.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:50
I was syncing Bitcoin Unlimited to be able to sell my bcash coins, of course this was just some copy of an outdated bitcoin (core) wallet and took forever to sync on a PC without SSD but lots of RAM and CPU. No wonder people don't sell their bcash coins if wallets are not even usable. Was not even half the speed of bitcoin and this will get worse and worse in the rare case their blocks actually get used and filled.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:27
If you are actually interested in a technical discussion, any proofs for that? Then wallets are resending obviously underpaying transactions too often if that is really an issue, and those transactions from those wallets should be considered as spam and IPs blocked to save bandwith.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:22:08
The moment i had seen andreas receiving that money i knew (again) why bitcoin will win, just the most amazing and strongest community you could imagine...
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:23:55
Actually a peer to peer decentralized currency is exactly what it is. And a really good currency when looking at the price.  
If satoshi was promising a cheap centralized paypal style payment network with a worthless currency in the whitepaper you would be right, but i don't read that anywhere.

Way larger dollar amounts needed on exchanges now compared to 2013, but the buying preassure is there, it will just take some more time.  
By the way, this is a lot easier to see once you switch the charts to log scale:
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:25:37
Price can get higher with a lot less bitcoins being bought if there aren't any for sale at lower prices. Basic supply and demand.
The same thing that prevents someone from cornering markets.

Bitcoin profits from greed, greed will make sure bitcoin always finds a way.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:46:41
That will at least support up to 50 million new big hodlers every year and up to 50 million users that transact frequently and use the LN.  Plus 100's of millions more users could use bitcoin the currency in a trusted setup with a wallet at for example coinbase. Coinbase would have LN channels open to bitpay and others, and coinbase users could do very very cheap bitpay payments using the bitcoin currency, just not using the trustless bitcoin or LN network themself. So i would say we can handle a lot more once exchanges etc start optimizing things.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:24:47
Did anyone promise to do that legwork for you? Like some company you are paying money for it? Don't think so.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:20:01
How about changing your perspective from "want" to "doing something about it" then? Like for example doing some research of which wallets provide SegWit and post it here.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:56:03
There is work needed everywhere. I totally don't get why there are so few big bitcoin companys actually supporting bitcoin by strengthening the ecosystem a lot more. They should always remember it is companys who add value that will survive, not companys trying to leech value.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:07:30
Wow finally someone who get's it! At least if more people want to go long it just means someone has to buy bitcoin or take insanely huge risks.

Or still undervalued by 2 orders of magnitude. Offshore banking is a 17 trillion market. $100 transactions to and from offshore accounts with free and open setup of accounts, looks like a good deal to me.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:52:20
Sold from $500 to nearly the top now, but so far it was a good idea to always just sell a few.
Since i give bitcoin a small chance to even be the largest currency on earth, i would never forgive myself selling them ALL for $'s or in my case €'s.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:30:12
I don't need bitcoin to scale to store my wealth in it, happy the way it works now to store a few millions uncensorable, decentralized and super secure, hard and honest money.  If i can also pay my coffee with BTC in future, great, but that is not what bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:13:05
I actually don't upgrade to SegWit on purpose because it keeps bitcoins block size smaller, which will keep the network more secure. Fuck big blockers lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:50:10
At millions of dollar in fees every day, it just shows how valuable it is for people to have their transactions included in the most secure, decentralized, censorship resistent and open ledger known to mankind.  I agree it would be better if we could afford to have microtransactions for cheap, but for me this "fee problem" is something to celebrate.  Bitcoin finally has to scale because everyone want's to use it, and we need to develope a fee market anyway.  
No reason we can't go to the mars now that we have reached the moon, we are getting experienced ;)

Since alts will have the exact same scaling problems atomic swaps with altcoins or using altcoins in general will just be a short term fix but no real scaling solution.  Bitcoin is not just the bitcoin client and network, it is an idea that will adapt to what is possible to stay the best money in existance.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:42:04
It was indeed better to beta test the fee market mechanics now than later. Important to keep bitcoin antifragile. I don't get why people are freaking out about that, but handling with information asymetry is part of making it stronger.

@_date: 2017-12-09 16:52:07
No one said that, but you also don't evaluate bitcoin like a stock. In 2012 i set my cash out prices in the 500 - 50.0000 range, would not be surprised at all if we hit the higher numbers also since marketcap is still lower than apple and bitcoin is starting to get far more liquid.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:35:31

When talking about timing the selling of "shitcoins you got for free" while someone is pumping it, anyone got any estimates on what the bitcoin gold guys are up to? Or do we have to wait for some ASIC drama and fud again before bitcoin gold is getting some pumping? Usually i just HODL bitcoin only but timing/trading free coins is a fun bonus.

@_date: 2017-12-27 13:17:25
Yeah fuck them, it is them making most of the bitcoin payment ecosystem unusable now, not the rising fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:05:48
Sidechains will be most important imho, no idea why they don't get more attention. We could just try bitcoin 2x, 8x or 1000x as a sidechain, same with Ethereum and all the other things that might be useful, just run it as sidechain and it will be BTC vs USD and EUR and not BTC vs BCH vs Bxx vs Bxy vs Byz vs ETH vs WTF
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:10:20
He says bitcoin companys need to get their head out of their ass, implementing SegWit, batch transactions, payment channels/LN. And we need to start on finding ways to work together more efficiently. IMHO more important than fighting wars about a number (blocksize) for years.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:12:29
You are wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:25:08
Did you even have a short look at how LN works? Theree is no counterparty risk as long as the main chain stays as decentralized as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:05:18
I am not an expert and not nearly as knowledgable as the core developers are, but let me try some math:  
1mb of mempool is getting flushed to new blocks every 10 minutes, but that will be the case if there is a backlog of transactions, or no backlog and cheap fees, so we can ignore the bandwith required for full or nearly full blocks considering you are for even bigger blocks.  
The mempool is at around 100mb now, so that makes it a backlog of around 100mb of transactions that will either get flushed when there is less transaction demand a few hours later, or resent.  
Getting flushed into new blocks later would be how the system is suposed to work, it would just mean everyone who got outbid on the fee auction has to wait a few hours, i guess you would agree with that being ok since so far this does not add any additional bandwith to your full node.
Now there is still 100mb - what will get flushed in the next hours too much in the mempool, so let's just assume this is 80mb of the mempool.  
Now if you say the mempool problem is adding lets say 100 GB of traffic per day to your node, do the math: 100000mb / 80mb = 1250.  
That would mean every transaction that is waiting in the mempool is getting resent 1250 times per day.
That does not make sense. If a transaction is sitting in the (100mb) mempool too long it should maybe get resent every 6 hours, but not 1250 times per day.  
You could argue that there are transactions that never even get included in the 100mb mempool, but then i would argue that this is just spam transactions.  
I might miss something here, but a much more logical scenario would be many new full nodes get started when price is rising, plus many more CSV wallets downloading new block data from you, compared to when price is not rising.  
Incidentally fees are usually high and mempool big when bitcoin is rising so that might explain why people think mempool backlog is causing traffic, when it really should not do that if you apply some logic which i am really sure the core devs do.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:28:08
I got into bitcoin at $5 and was sure it would break it's 2011 all time high of $30 some day when i started hodling, like 1000's of now unfortunately silent other people. To me 10.000 is the moon, next stop mars tho ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:56:54
Don't forget to close the door on the way out, thanks. Your "discussions" are just wasting time of people actually doing some work. And have fun with your altcoins, which will just be nice test networks to see what might be worth implementing into bitcoin when the time is right, not when crybabies are crying.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:14:14
It is (beside Sidechains) the only way we know to keep bitcoin main network itself decentralized. You can build all kinds of networks on a decentralized network, but if bitcoin get's too centralized you won't be able to build decentralized networks on top of it.

@_date: 2017-12-27 13:15:16
If bitpay wanted to keep their business model, all they would have to do is integrate LN or even just simple payment channels to coinbase and other web wallet providers. Nice to see them getting disrupted if they choose to sleep instead.

@_date: 2017-12-29 07:09:38
Amex, visa, MC, debit, PayPal, Money orders and paper money are networks built on top of national currencys.  Like sidechains for bitcoin.  If there were no borders and nations with with armys and weapons, it would not make any economical sense at all to have more than 1 currency. More networks as sidechains or 2nd layer networks, of course, but please explain what is good about having more than one currency with the best monetary policy?  There is no reason except making traders and exchanges leech value from society.

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:12:32
Bitcoin is a currency which would be kind of lame if it's market cap wasn't a lot higher than any individual stock, this is why i said you can't compare it, but still made the argument that it is still not even as high as apple, something that is far less liquid. Most people on the planet are not even allowed to buy apple stock.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:42:11
Exactly, altcoins do a lot of work for us, so it is good to have them. There is just not reason for them to have value beyond being a bitcoin testnet that needs a little value to have the game theoretic aspects work.  They will help bitcoin find the sweet spot between features like contracts and zero knowledge proofs, and scalability.  
Will be even impossible to find a better name for an altcoin than bitcoin, so forget about them getting a major network effect once hype dries out.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:11:03
Indeed, but we had a lot of that energy in the first years of bitcoin too. It is just not visible anymore under all this noise :(
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:50:47
Bitcoin as an idea and brand will never die. It is a distributed autonomous organization and it's shareholders will keep it alive and ahead of everything else. If bitcoin as an idea is not anti-fragile enough to beat all other currencys including the USD and EURO, no other cryptocurrency will be.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:10:26
Can anyone on the planet sign up on Robinhood? And do they own the stock under their own name? When i mean you can't compare it, i mean the valuation. Obviously bitcoin makes no sense, and it does not make sense to have 100s of exchanges worldwide just for bitcoin, if it will never be worth more than apple. Which is just a stock and not a worldwide currency of the internet. So i would still argue you can't compare the 2, but does that forbid me to talk about both in 1 sentence?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:26:06
Your uploads are not 200 GB per day because of the mempool lol, how about you looking at how bitcoin works instead of me? Your upload is at 200 GB because at 1mb it is already producing a huge blockchain all the newcomers will have to sync and download from your node. Have fun serving them 2 TB per hour if we just increase the blocksize as much as "needed". And i am not even talking about 1 GB blocks here. Check your logic first please, thanks.

Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.  
On one side it hurts bitcoin, on the other side we need stupid or malicious people attacking bitcoin as early as possible, if it is truely antifragile it will survive and be stronger. If not we are most likely all just wasting our time.

When hyperbitcoinization happens, the free market will find solutions to increase capacity.
Some people won't like the way it is done since it surely will not be on chain mainly.
If paypal started doing bitcoin transactions internally we could do coffee transactions tomorrow without a big risk of anyone losing anything if you still store larger amounts on chain.

At 1 trillion market cap bitcoin would be as big as the swiss franc, the question is will it also be as stable as the swiss franc when it reaches that size?  
The bigger bitcoin gets the more useful it will be as a tool for a speculative attack against some small but major national currency, so whales will have some fun for a while.

Maybe he just doesn't want them to take freedom from everyone else, the only thing they are good at.

Actually i really think it was a good thing for bitcoin, bitcoin can't get anti-fragile without attacks. Funny thing is gavin introduced the minimum transaction size partly because of satoshidice spam, if he was worried with 1mb blocks getting full, why wasn't he worried about gigabyte blocks years later. I think without knowing bitcoins history people can't really evaluate people like gavin and their intentions or ability to think logically.

POW is not an issue lol, it is what makes bitcoin different to vaporware.

More profitable to make scam tokens than investing in something that adds value. We need to educate people to stop that, but given the complexity and game theory involved, i don't have high hopes lol

Lol, bitcoin by definition is pure anarchy, don't like it? Play somewhere else.

Exactly, some people in germany are starting to get it. Not because they have even a small clue about how bitcoin works, but because they understand the importance of something like it. Heard a banker once say "If it is really anonymous and working, that is huge".

I am thinking the same about altcoiners, ICO buyers, blockchain "investors", let's see who is right in 6 years.

Add some Elon Musk style thinking to that: If we can get the cost of rearranging atoms from base matereals to bitcoin mining hardware down to near zero, at some point it would be stupid not to buy 1000s of bitcoin miners if you have excess energy in low demand times. IMHO every power company will be a bitcoin miner in the future. There won't be "mining companys" just power companys.

Sources? How would gold be money with that definition? Silver, Gold and Bitcoin are money, everything else is currency IMHO.

So you want bad genetics to get children they can only get because people with good genetics are working longer for them? That is not how evolution should work. And on top of that you still got the fat and lazy leeching from that socialism.

Yes it is not a perfect analogy, but blockchain is just a buzzword too. They are just calling very ineffective and confusing databases blockchain, a word that is not even worth existing, as with cloud. I never say "Let me use XY cloud to do ABC" and i will never say "Let me use blockchain XY to do ABC". I just google things and i will just pay with bitcoin, that's all that is important.

Replace blockchain in your text with cloud, and it would have also made sense 12 years ago. Bitcoin blockchain is like googles cloud, and blockchain and cloud in general are just buzzwords that will fade away in the next 6-12 years. Will be so funny to watch this market fall like a house of cards while hodling my precious bitcoin.

Ether wasn't even meant to be a currency that is good as a store of value like bitcoin when Vitalik started the project. Bitcoin is the only hard cash out there, except gold. Like it or not.

Don't forget that some, if not a lot of them will also defect and join us secretly, or already did.

Bitcoin is an experiment, a very successful one so far.

Maybe you should do some research. I thought roger stopped paying people to shill for BCH? Looked like it, guess i was wrong or you are just seriously misguided.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:25:26
German here too. This is so true. But looking at you for example, there seem to be exceptions luckily. Also we german people like complaining a lot. Will be interesting at least.
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:36:11
Maybe i should have used the word money. Bitcoin is money. Gold was and is money. Everything else is just currency. And Altcoins like Ether are not even that, just some Token maybe.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:18:58
I always thought we should thank all the idiots "investing" in the test nets for bitcoin aka altcoins. They wouldn't be a good test net without value. I feel bad for those thinking they are actually investing in a real currency.

Why should it cost all if one individual chooses to live very unhealthy, no sports, a lot of trash food? Why should anyone who takes care of himself be forced to work longer so some lazy fat ass can continue eating McDonalds 7 times a week?
