Each line is an equal percentage apart. Instead of being an equal number apart. I.e. instead of going 10, 20, 30, it goes 10% 20% 30%.
The concept here is that the change in % is more meaningful than the raw change in the number. The proportion is more significant. How long does it take to grow by $100 might not be the right question. How long does it take to grow 1% might be more of what were trying to grasp.
A number like 100 might be arbitrary: because going from 1$ to 101$ is very different from going from $10,000 to $10,100. So maybe they should be represented differently. On a linear scale though, they wouldnt be represented differently. The $100 move from 1$ to $101 would be the same height as the $100 move from $10,000 to $10,100 (on a linear scale).
And its not always used to show a bullish optimistic perspective. Sometimes its used to show that even though something appears to be increasing at a steady rate or ever increasing rate, it might actually be slowing down, you just arent realizing that 100$ increase every day actually means its growing slower each day. Its growing by a smaller proportion of itself each time. Slowing down.

It doesnt mean anything the military has never in its history used its might to confront someone who charged too much for a can of soda (or anything else.). I think youre missing that asking for $100 for a can of soda is saying you think usd is worth 1/100th of what most people believe it is- however no one has ever been punished for doing anything along those lines.

All money is a communal agreement that some weird paper with drawings of pyramids on it is valuable. Is all money communist? If we all stop believing money is valuable, it becomes worthless. Its only valuable if we can get other people to give us goods and services for it. Otherwise whats it for? 
So it really is all a faith based system, isnt it? Regardless of what currency youre using? Whether its the united states dollar or the Bolivar? If people dont want the money then its useless. If they do then its not. What are the fundamentals of the united states dollar- its valuable because of the country where its used, united states. So if the us was gone it wouldnt be valuable. 
And your argument is something like because bitcoin has no "home" in the way USD has the united states, it has no fundamentals and isnt valuable. And is communist. I disagree though, what difference would it make if btc came from some specific place. I think thats a fallacy- theres no one holding a gun to my head demanding that i percieve USD as valuable- so its really not protected at all. Same as BTC. Yes. BTC is crazy. It seems like the value could drop at any moment right.. Ands its true- BUT no more true than it is for USD. All of these systems are the same. We, me and you, determine its value. 
BTC could drop overnight if everyone decided it was worthless. 
The exact same is true of USD or literally any other currency. If everyone decides a currency is worthless, it becomes worthless. Immediately. You cannot use it at the store if everyone decides its worthless. Its garbage. Thats it. It's over. It only works as long as everyone is in agreement that it works.

You dont need to pay anyone anything, the whole premise of bitcoin is that no one "owns" it. Imagine keeping your money in a wallet in your pocket. Its free right? Thats how bitcoin wallets work. Its free. If you want to pay more for a fancy wallet to protect your USD you can, and you can do the same for bitcoin.

USD is backed by the military in the same way bitcoin is backed by all the weapons bitcoin owners posess- which is not at all. As i said no one is holding a gun to anyones head making them sell a can of soda for $1, theres no one stopping anyone from raising the price to $100 for a can of soda. The money can fluctuate wildly and instantaneously. Both can. Theres no rule saying either cannot. Theres no mechanism that would stop anyone from doing it.
