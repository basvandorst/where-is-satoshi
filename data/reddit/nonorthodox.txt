Many reasons not to hardfork now:
- Segwit is already a blocksize increase.
- Spam will always fill blocks, increasing blocksize won't make it go away. It can make it a bit more expensive, but fees won't ever go down to near zero, unless you're using 2nd layer.
- Increasing blocksize will centralize full nodes. I have been running a full node since 2010, had to upgrade my SSD earlier this year, and I am on the edge of my bandwidth limit. Bigger blocksizes will cost me a lot more. Consider that SSDs aren't cheap nor bandwidth in the third-world country I live in.
- Hardforking should almost never occur, and instead of using the opportunity to include other fixes and features, Segwit2X devs are rushing this release without even proper replay protection (so far) or a roadmap for after it.
From the three benefits you listed, the last two are already part of Segwit activating, and the first one is a guess at best, and very unlikely to be true (given for example how it doesn't even have transaction replay protection).

It is not as secure. If everyone used pruning, archivist nodes would be centralized by miners and a few companies. A large share of bitcoin's security comes from decentralization, and that's why you should consider running your own archivist node.

Because the whole blockchain already eats a little more than 118GB of disk space. How much extra space do you have in your everyday laptop?

Plenty of people host their own node and/or wallet. Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized, and if you want all the security and advantages of it, you should be running your own.
So running a node in your laptop is a lot more common than you think.

Where does he talk about an old laptop? He doesn't.

Why would you need a third party service to do so? Why not just sending the coins directly to the content creator's address?
