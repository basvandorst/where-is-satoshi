And if you use a lightweight wallet on a desktop/phone, they should continue to work without any software updates. Lightweight wallets do not care about the block size limit because they only receive block headers from full nodes, and the wallet will simply follow the longest chain (the chain with the most miners/hashrate).

Are you serious? Idk about where you live, but in the US, people get their food before they pay at normal restaurants. If you wanted to scam the restaurant, you'd just walk out the door instead of doing anything with bitcoin.

There's no way to give yourself free money without other nodes rejecting the blocks and transactions.

It's better to use a map veto system where each team gets to veto maps one at a time. The last map remaining once each team vetoes two maps is the map that gets played.

Any competitive map is better than all of those listed. The competitive map pool is: dust2, train, mirage, overpass, cobblestone, inferno, cache. Play 5v5 on any of those maps with 15 second freezetime, 1:45 round time, 35 second bomb timer. You can find a server config file from some league site like ESEA or CEVO. 
If you want to promote bitcoin and get a lot of people involved, you can advertise this on ESEA.net forums, CEVO forums, etc. There are a lot of people with real 5 man teams who will be willing to play high level CS for bitcoin. It shouldn't be that hard to convince people to play, since only 1 member of each team actually needs to know how to use bitcoin to send the entry fee. Also, nobody is going to want to play CSGO competitively at anything higher than 100 ping, so you'd most likely have to separate the European and North American tournaments. This is already complicated enough ignoring server considerations. Organizing a good online tournament is a tough job.

The treasury does not make the decision over whether or not the US dollar is used as a reserve currency. Every other country decides that. The definition of reserve currency:


Bitcoin is CERTAINLY more appealing as a reserve currency than the inflating US dollar. Why wouldn't every country use a reserve currency that can be sent anywhere within 10 minutes, in large amounts, not controlled by any government, and does not inflate? It seems like there are obvious advantages, and there is evidence that countries are slowly getting rid of their US dollars in reserve.

It sounded interesting a first, then I read that it's on shit maps, with shit rules, and with no team mates. That's not how you play competitive CS.

Video of the talk?

decentralized, no inflation; quick, international transactions


At this point, I think this is troll. Crypto-currencies might be the only currencies that CAN'T be counterfeit....

Was this not expected? Everybody knows there are bots that steal from bad brainwallets.

Your score is 100%
I'd be interested in a harder test. Some ideas:
* why is a blockchain necessary? to maintain a consensus of the order of all transactions; prevent double spending
* what is a confirmation? 
* Is "SxnqD2plmQ5!" a good brainwallet passphrase? no

This is so frustrating to watch. I decided that I wanted to invest in bitcoin when it was $250 each. It has taken me a week to move my money around to make that happen, so now it's $300 :(

If he has access to the private key, then the potential malware already could have access to it anyway. It's not hard to make malware that constantly scans the clipboard for private keys. What does bitaddress have anything to do with it? You're just pointing out the obvious; nothing in bitcoin is safe if your computer is infected.

$5/month just to see 15-25% fewer ads? lmao.. And that's for "typical" people.

Obviously it's flawed, but it's still a better metric than Expedia's bitcoin usage. You can easily see a consistent upward trend in total transactions
If you're not capable of spotting out the spam attack and ignoring the outliers, then I really feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 04:00:34
What you said isn't very *logical*. If anything, the fact that people were initially booking hotels just to show support is the reason for the negative results. The fact that bitcoin usage on sites decreases after the initial announcement should be expected. I wish the article explained during what time period the 40% decrease happened. If the time period was the entire time Expedia accepted bitcoin, then the data definitely isn't surprising. 
Seems like the hype simply died down for using bitcoin on Expedia, not necessarily bad news for bitcoin itself. Total transactions is a better indicator for bitcoin imo.

Go to  and go to "Wallet Details" and enter the private key there. It'll give you the public key which you can search on 
bitaddress is a JavaScript-only web app, so the private key never goes through bitaddress' servers. It's safe to use.

By the time that happens, humans would be extinct anyway. Or perhaps EMP explosives will take out all technology and only paper wallets will remain. Either way, we have bigger problems. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:33:08
If you think that a 40% decrease in bitcoin usage on Expedia (over an unknown time span) isn't meaningless, then what does it mean to you? Also, you still haven't proposed a good way of "judging the bitcoin economy." Do these other methods of judging the bitcoin economy match the meaning you take from a 40% drop on Expedia?

Would it really be practical to have an intergalactic cryptocurrency? It would take many years for a radio signal to reach even some of the closest stars in our galaxy. Maybe they'll make an intergalactic coin where new blocks are only generated every 10 years, so they can exchange large portions of goods between planets.
