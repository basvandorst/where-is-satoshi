if you sell bitcoin in advance of the possible price manipulation, you can buy discounted bitcoin at the manipulators' expense. how many of us are doing this already? perhaps actually accomplishing price manipulation is nearly impossible, but what they actually want is for us to fear them.

obvioulsy ripple (aka JP Morgan Coin) which isn't even a real cryptocoin since it is centralized and has no proof of work AND WAS CREATED BY THE BANKS has people involved who are conspiring against bitcoin. but nooooooo it's not like the central bankers have ever done anything manipulative for financial gain

they would have had to already done valid work to commit anything to the blockchain.

it just so happens to coincide with the Ripple pump right at the end of the tax year...

they had the right to it. like a check you haven't cashed yet. the point is that they lost their own bitcoin - they didn't destroy somebody else's

this post could've been titled someone LOST 12.5 bitcoin and it would've been far less inflammatory. also the timing of this post is suspicious

51% Attack: The ability of someone controlling a majority of network hash rate to revise transaction history and prevent new transactions from confirming. -

it means that Bitmain - and whoever is backing this company to have allowed it to get so extremely successful in a totalitarian country - has probably already secretly edited the blockchain to put many of the millions of unclaimed coins into wallets they control. this is only possible if a single entity achieves more than 50% control of the blockchain for even an instant - which should never even come close to happening - but it already did.
the inconvenient conclusion that this chart clearly suggests is that bitcoin has already been hijacked by a manipulative centralized authority - which may be why the establishment and mainstream media now embrace it - and that the coin is now opposite to what was intended

mjamin.github.io/bitmaindominance says BTC.TOP is Bitmain but this is point is inconsequential because even without BTC.TOP the other three are well over 50%, not to mention the unknown section

there is a difference between FUD - which is an appeal to emotion - and negative conclusions as the result of rational, evidence-based analysis
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:07:39
it means that they probably already revised transaction history of the blockchain so that the millions of unclaimed coins are now in their control

this is a new concept website i am working on. the site itself is fairly limited for now but it's main purpose is just to express the idea and get feedback on whether it's worth developing

This is a new site I am working on - right now it's still pretty limited - but the main point is to express the idea and get feedback on how and whether I should develop it

if you actually read the article Rand explains how the Fed has never been properly audited, they refuse to answer the most important questions.

it is not fully audited, they refuse to answer the most important questions. if it was actually fully transparent there wouldn't be senators and a whole movement of people backing this movement

get a prenup. hear me out. im not saying it to be a dick, i understand that young love is a beautiful thing, but if you want to keep it that way - i.e. not fat - having the right incentives in place is essential. essential. don't underestimate the cute girl act - they can be vicious. and don't be stupid/naive about the most important things in your life. im not saying "dont share" - im just saying that how much you share your wealth should be up to you, not some judge.
