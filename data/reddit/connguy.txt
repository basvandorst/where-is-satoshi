It's perfectly alright to discuss the bad, by no means am I suggesting a "fake it til you make it" strategy. But I also find it childish to suggest that everything is burning to the ground as a result of a speedbump like this one. It's the same way I felt when the suicide hotline was posted after the China debacle

But again, suppose I only receive bitcoin once every couple of weeks, and not really in any situations where I'm concerned whether somebody can tie it to me. Is there any point in changing addresses then?
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:18:57
I've heard this before, can somebody explain why I as an individual would want to change public addresses every time I receive bitcoin? If I only receive bitcoin once every couple of weeks or even months, why is it a big deal?

Actually that's exactly the case he's arguing.

One of the best managed subs on all of reddit right there

don't get all up-in-arms and offended because we don't immediately form a campaign to throw money at this address. This is the internet, domain of trolls, hackers, and scammers. While you do seem much more personable, available, and convincing than many of said scammers, it's not unheard of for people to be just as convincing who are absolutely, 100% lying.
It's one of the effects of anonymity. Anonymity is great, it allows us to post whatever we want and discuss things without facing handicaps due to experience, race, gender, background, or any other masking factors; instead we can present ideas purely on the merit of the idea itself, and see if it takes root. The tradeoff is that you have no idea who you're talking to on the other end, and far more often than you'd like, the person on the other end has malicious intents.
Long story short, this picture has just enough believability and empathetic value to gain some decent social traction, but when you really break it down, *we have no idea who you are, or whether we can trust you*. So don't act like the community is filled with horrible people just because we won't take you at your word.

pretty sure youtube ads don't meet the very stringent requirements for placement on the "acceptable" whitelist

This is disappointing guys. What happened to "bitcoin isn't an investment, it's a currency"? Don't freak out when shit like this happens, just stay it out and weather the storm. Maybe pick up some cheap coins on the way

This sounds very fake...

That's not what they're talking about. There's a major controversy going down right now surrounding the release of the iOS 7 jailbreak by the evad3rs, who appear to have sold out to a Chinese company and caused a severe amount of drama among the jailbreak community. Have a look at to get a better idea.

If you want a brief rundown, earlier today a release for the iOS 7 jailbreak came out which sparked a lot of controversy and drama due to reasons that are difficult to understand if you aren't plugged into the jailbreak scene. Essentially, the creators of the jailbreak sold out to an overseas company, a move which is not bad on its own, but went hand-in-hand with some possible insertion of spamware and other shady business like piracy. There's a lot of hearsay involved, but you can get an idea from several threads on right now.

This is not a debate for this sub, but it has been held countless thousands of times on this website. You might want to have a tour through (when it isn't run over by the iOS 7 controversy) sometime before you go running your mouth.

Have you seriously never heard of reddit's vote-fuzzing? *Every post on reddit gets automatic downvotes to balance the upvotes*. This is to keep any single post from absolutely drowning out other content. OP, you're an idiot.

Actually this has nothing to i with Apple itself...

This title is completely inaccurate. The iOS 7 jailbreak places your phone at exactly ZERO risk of hard-bricking, which is what most people mean when they say bricking. There is some chance of entering a boot-loop (aka soft-brick) if you installed iOS 7 through OTA (in other words, updated without plugging into a computer). This is called a soft brick though, because it is 100% fixable, and easily so. 
The controversy about this jailbreak has to do with the evad3rs (who made it) releasing at an extremely rushed pace without allowing devs time to update with the jailbreak, due to the fact that they sold out on making the jailbreak to a Chinese company. In addition, there is some possibility that they may have included some light spamware, which sparks a lot of outrage among the jailbreak community. Most of this is hearsay though, and absolutely none of it is actually relevant to bitcoin. For people jailbroken on iOS 6, the bitcoin apps are perfectly functional and readily available.

I assume you're referring to the iOS 7 release controversy, not controversy over jailbreaking as a whole?
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:36:35
Same to you.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:19:51
I like my iPhone because it works. Always. Plus iOS is the superior vanilla OS, and the 5S is the fastest smartphone on the market. Once you factor in jailbreaking, you've completely eliminated Apple's barriers.
Basically, my point is that the idea of the iphone being restricted is inaccurate.

That's why the Chinese getting involved is such a significant development. The Chinese aren't interested in BTC as an in investment; they want to actively use it as a currency unswayed by their government. As such, it's a *huge* population of people who want it purely for its potential, not the investement.
