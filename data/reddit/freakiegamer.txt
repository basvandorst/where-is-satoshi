Ever heard of the 30 day rule?
I don't have a copy of the EULA I agreed to back on May 1st but I am pretty sure it was getting consent to power usage changing... not asking for my permission to take longer than 30 days.

I am pretty sure my post implied that I knew what the policy is... I assumed that most readers would catch that. 
So, if you wrote my original post and you received a comment saying what is already implied, wouldn't you think that the comment was sarcastic? Because that's is what I thought it was... In my book, sarcastic comments deserve sarcastic replies...

This article says 50 million... not 500. This would have a 30GH unit produce roughly $10.00 a day which puts payback at roughly 3 months. I know the difficulty wont stay at that level but it means that most of these devices will pay for themselves in under 6 months.

I didn't downvote shit - downvoted lizard because he is an asshole... you were merely playing devil's advocate until the last few posts

The last laptop I owned was an apple - and at my last job I had (Sysadmin at a university) purchased apple laptops for everyone. 
Funny story about university though - Campus wide, they purchased iMac's for all computer labs and macbook pro's for employees. The tech support calls went through the roof and the support staff couldn't manage them all... so Windows was put on all these apple computers... 
There is a reason why Apple computers don't have a large market share...

I agree - this just seems borderline illegal to me and I was wondering if their is any way to strong arm them into giving me a refund...
I ordered a product and have not received it and requesting a refund... its not like my order is going to be discarded or thrown away.
Apparently they know they have screwed the pooch on this and don't want to lose their pants on all these refunds...

Hmm - user since today.
I would stay away from this site everybody

Sorry - you lost me on that one... but I am going to assume what you are saying is difficult and not worth the trouble

This comment wasn't directed towards you... Look again - it was directed at the guy telling me to go fuck myself...

You do understand that the ONLY reason mac doesn't do any of this is simply because they have no market share right? 
If out of nowhere, Apple had 89% of the PC market, they would have the same exact problems. There is simply not enough people out there to exploit and make money from. 
Look at every single hacking competition that has ever existed... Apple never wins...
There have been viruses for Apple computers. Apple has also been very slow to fix these. Sometimes, they even ignore the issues altogether. 
So, get off your high horse and be a little more open minded. Just because you are a drone to Apple's marketing doesn't mean there are not viable alternatives.
