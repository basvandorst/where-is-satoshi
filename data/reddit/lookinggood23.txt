Yes they do say that about stores of value , only a fool would put all of their assets into one pot.
Just because something has the name store of value it doesn’t mean it can’t loose as well as gain.
Property, gold, bitcoins, stock ect ect ... have all lost and gained.
As for influence on markets, I meant more over that gold and diamond markets and oil markets are over produced at time to drive down the price, hence they limit supply, this does not mean that the supply is so scarce as people believe.
On the BTC side it is scarce period and that supply can’t be manipulated by design.
You have mis interpreted my words.
All markets can be manipulated by price, BTC can’t by supply unlike all the ones I previously mentioned that can.
Either way BTC always trumps those other markets and will long into the future IMO.

It’s a great idea that anything and everything is for sale in BTC, why the hell do we want the hassle of buying with fiat, and it’s not everyone who doesn’t want to spend.
The housing market is one place a lot of savvy people will re invest their crypto gains, more estate agents need this realisation for the future and accept crypto, especially BTC.

And I wonder exactly how many third parties you’ve lived with since birth, only to realise since BTC that third parties are not so good.
Escrow are a third party and they work fine, it isn’t all third parties.

Problem there  is that they don’t teach finance in U.K. schools, so most adults here in U.K. and abroad are financially retarded.
The average Brit doesn’t know his or her mortgage interest rate, and they all think they are big investors if they have been granted a mortgage.
These are the reasons banks get away with what they do, the truth is the public are generally financially dumb.
They are like bulls with rings through their noses, they can be lead, once you take the ring out they haven’t got a clue what to do.

Totally of subject but of interest, take a look sometime at how much art work is forged, usually used also as a store of value.

After seeing warren buffet back in the news today and reading more of his ridiculously jealous claims about what bitcoin isn’t, this should be enough for any true crypto believer to dump gold on the spot and buy more BTC.
Hoping these people like buffet will fall off their perch at some point thanks BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:59:13
People say don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, in any investment port folio.
Bitcoin is a new technology so it deserves some caution, but logically that caution is less monthly as it becomes more ingrained.
And what to invest in, well anything that’s not controlled by an individual or market, you will find gold, oil, and diamonds and other are highly susceptible to market manipulation, all mined substances until BTC came along can have their mining increased or slowed, meaning they can influence the price at will.
Anyone who argues BTC is the same doesn’t understand the algorithmic nature of the supply command.
Believe me BTC is the future, when the fog lifts from people’s eyes they will also say eureka also.
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:02:07
Arguably also gold may be able to be produced in the future by artificial means, that would mean the supply could be increased and value could plummet.
Gold production is only mineral science at the end of the day.
BTC cannot be manufactured or faked.

And does that matter, I think your grasping at straws as the world you talking about is a world of chaos.
If you tried to transact with me in gold in such a world I’d just take your gold if you, you wouldn’t advertise the fact you had the stuff in a world with no phone or computers.
You can have power without power station, they have dynamo wind up or solar sheets that charge phones and computers.
I’m sure there will or would be away even in the scenario you envisage, there’s some shit  hot intellect out there.
So it’s not kinda exactly is it, just more you’ve not thought about it very well and think that because you have a piece of yellow metal you’ll be fine ��.
But now you should clearly see golds use case is “well” being replaced, has been in many ways.

You tell me one feature gold has that BTC cannot match either now or by adding software, believe me there are none.
Gold is an old school commodity, for the old school guard.
No one cares who uses gold, least of all me but from what even I’ve said, buying it should be less attractive as BTC does all and many more things IMO.

@_date: 2018-04-29 06:32:46
Why is it moot, your talking rubbish.
If you look it was an answer to a question about war, those people at that time who had gold as a store of value had it stolen and lost their money PERIOD, it’s not up for debate it’s etched in history.
My point is or was, weather bitcoins have be hacked or not, they in the same circumstance would be harder to get in the same way, showing they are more robust.
If hacking is the best best reason not to buy bitcoins over gold then I’m dumb founded.
Let’s also stress that hacking is harder now than ever since cold storage devices have matured, BLOCKCHAIN isn’t hackable it’s self, master satoshi and the miners make and made sure of this.
And going forward these firewalls will increase in complexity making hacking even harder.
Common sense should prevail for anyone, if the pros and cons list shows gold may have one or two functions better than BTC ( and in my opinion it doesn’t) that is not a reason to say it is better, in fact I would go for the one which has the most pros and every time this is BTC” FACT”.

IMO golds physical attribution in any form is it’s worst, apart from jewellery.
And jewellery is no more unique than owning an expensive hat.
Catch a plane and bring your gold through customs? No unless you have under the limit for transfer,plus each time the metal detectors will go off and security will be alerted.
You do know it can be manufactured through nuclear fusion, take a rogue state  in the future who decide to do so, as the technology has progressed enough for that to be possible.
Your store of value could plummet as over supply is in abundance.
This isn’t fantasy, it is possible.
Try selling jewellery second hand, you only ever get scrap value.
I admit it’s ok for jewellery and for rappers teeth, but that’s about as far as it goes for me.
BTC is a beautiful thing to see in a wallet my friend, prettier than gold and rarer.
In fact better in all the cases I mention above and rarer than gold.

That’s opinion, yes it is radioactive, but it doesn’t mean it’s not possible at some point in the future and at a cheaper cost.
All of it seems very pointless when you can mine bitcoin, but run a global payment network to-boot at the same time.
Like I’ve shown 90% of gold is just pure wasteful mining of a substance that does nothing than sit in vaults.
Even if BTC mining uses that same cost through its mining, it’s use cases are far more adapt and useful.
Smart contracts, bulletproof, tap root, graft root, micro payments, cross border instant payments, LN and the list goes on.
Value ummmm BTC or gold ������.
Gold cannot adapt, it is what it is, survival of the fittest will prevail, and that or those that adapt to their situation the best always survive the best.
Because BTC has adaption power, the writing is on the wall.

A store of value is a function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved or exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful at a later time.
I think BTC handsomely fills a store of values criteria.
As in response to the other baloney you desperately put forward I reiterate,
Bitcoin £6750 per coin 
Gold £1320 per ounce,
And will still be this price come next year,
As it was all last year,
It may be stable, but who cares BTC is growing and taking its market slowly, and you must know it also.
As clearly this hedge fund manager also does.
There is one more thing you sadly mentioned the many coins that have been created, falsely as many do believe as you clearly do that this will harm BTC, but it won’t and doesn’t.
It may be above your head, but Nike is the largest sports wear company on earth and has its products copied all the time, yet there Nike stays and so does its market cap.
BTC can’t be faked, it is BTC core or isn’t, when the fog clears you will understand also how BTC always wins, by design.
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:06:12
But that last bit about the limited supply may be, but either way BTC price always out preforms other assets or commodities, the proof is on the pudding, it is deflationary also by design this is why it will outperform gold ��.
I disagree completely that BTC isn’t a store of value and I think personally you are barking mad to come out with a comment like that.
90 % of BTC holders are doing fine and will do into the future financially because or the increased value they gain, store of value, it seems your arguing against what you originally said ��.
And fixed supply is fixed supply for a reason, I will let you work that out for yourself and your port folio haha.
$1320 for one ounce of gold, blah blah.
BTC £6700 from 0 each new adopter means higher price.
Gold just stays the same waiting for some disaster.
It’s a joke.
And that’s 9000 years of gold appreciation, which is even more of a joke.

Of course they are around, they were a cold storage device and still are, the TITAN MINT produced many and may still produce.
They are loaded with one BTC or half a BTC, the hologram rips when you tear it back to reveal an address and QR code, this ensures it can’t be sold on as a loaded coin.
My advise don’t buy now, it’s a past exercise, just buy normal BTC off an exchange.
I say this because I had one, a titan which I cashed in, I still have the coin, which is silver and worth probably £50, I was pissed as I had It stored a long time so the bcash folk occurred and the company didn’t support the fork so in theory they got the bcash money, as they controlled the private key.
I pleaded with them to give me the private key but  they wouldn’t, so I sold it on as a coin you don’t have the private key for is not really yours, and could go missing instantly.
They look good and are novelty but keep away, especially if the seal is broken on the hologram. 
These are real physical coins.

There are other conductors if gold wasn’t available and in use case I think you’ll find only about 10 % of produced gold is used in electronics.
As you may see it’s use cases become weaker the more we dig.
Gold use in electronics is only mainly because it doesn’t tarnish, there are cheaper conductors that work just as well.
So we can still mine out BTC��.

Interesting you say that and your correct, but in all out war, most of the time the most powerful invading forces generally find your gold supplies and take them for themselves, reference nazi Germany.
So it may survive but as to weather it will be in your possession for long is way debatable.
As for your Scenario about the internet and power, crypto does survive, it will be there whenever those systems are back online, but a world without power�� is a dark place one in which I can envisage anyone and everyone stealing your gold, chaos equals crime and lawlessness equals chaos, since in general gold is so obvious both in weight and as you clearly see desirability, I will let you be the first to advertise you have some in a world without power.��
