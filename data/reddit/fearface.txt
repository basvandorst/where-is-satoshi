Not oppossed, but highly skeptical. Broken until proven working correctly. I like the enthusiasm, but in the end of the day, the short comings are more defining.

They correct you because they want to improve the information you provided. You should not take this personal, but just integrate the corrections and learn something from it. IMO it's your reaction that is a bit irritating ;-)

Can you tell me, when I should start to eat the popcorn? It's getting stale.... ;-)

If it's much more expensive than Paypal.

For bitcoin to suceed in emergent countries, it's important that transactions fees are low.

Thanks for the explanation, I understand your point. I also wish, that everyone is able to run a full node. Sadly in countries where power and internet is not permanently available, running a full node is close to impossible.
Would you recommend to promote Bitcoin in such areas at all? 
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:43:06
I often meet people who are experts about Bitcoin like you, that are totally out of touch with the people that actually use Bitcoin on a day to day basis..... how can you expect for everyone that wants to receive Bitcoins to have a full node running?

I'm looking forward to see you carry your $200 computer into a coffee shop to pay with Bitcoins. /s
Why don't you take your time, to read up on SPV and current wallets on mobile: 
All of these wallets provide more security and recoverability than e.g. cash.

You're right, for the very few that have $200 to run their own node, a $0.05 fee is not an issue. But for for the majority that use their 5 year old Android phone as bitcoin wallet, it is an issue. Just because you belong to the 10% of the worlds populations for whom $0.05 is nothing, does not mean it's true for the other 90% as well.

No, Classic people shout that Core is a failure. Every regular user experiences what vice describes.
$0.05 may not be much to you, but in other countries they use bitcoin to send someone $0.05....

In an Kenyan used book store, you'll find books for $0.05. Im the gorontalo market, you'll buy fish fir lunch, ...

It's a tradeoff between safety and convenience.
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:55:16
So where do these millions transactions per second happen? And bitcoin is at most pseudonymous.
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:26:30
Wait a minute.....are you by chance Satoshi Nakamoto or close to him? Because that's the level of visionary I'm getting. /s
