Although I understand their opinion, for the other side honestly the Nano S is my favorite.  Even like it better than Nano X.  I have a Trezor 1 and T, Nano S and X, and a keepkey.  Because I only have bitcoin and some ether it works perfect for me.  Don’t like the small touch screen on the T, trezor one is nice, but don’t like typing in the passphrase on the computer.  
Honestly at this price the keepkey is a steal though!  Shoot, it’s almost worth it for the nice braided usb cable alone.  Yes, it seems to have dropped development, but way better than keeping in Coinbase and hot wallet via electrum which seems to be your case.  Hard to beat $5 shipping included until you can decide what hardware wallet best suits you.  Honestly can’t go wrong with any of them.

Much better than keeping on exchanges, and completely worth $5.  Development on it seems to have ceased which isn't great, but for $5 certainly can not be beaten.  All else being equal a Ledger or Trezor device is better in my opinion, but you aren't going to get Ledger or Trezor device for anywhere near $5 shipped.
Not sure why there isn't more excitement for this, it's a steal and great for someone just getting in with not that much, but still wants to have it secure.   Also potentially great for someone wanting to get into multi-sig with multiple hardware wallets if they already have one.
Last bit of advice, after updating just use it with Electrum.  No need to use the Shapeshift service at all.
PS: Not the greatest job hiding the confirmation number.  :)

Of course you would get in trouble if caught.  It’s tax fraud.  What are the chances you’ll get caught?  Probably very low, but just like any tax fraud one has to decide for themselves whether it is worth the risk.

Yeah, unless there is some problem with seed generation all should be good, even if so with a secure enough passphrase it should still be safe.  I believe it does/did use the same code as Trezor, so I imagine if something comes up with Trezor then is the time to worry.
I may be paranoid, but I too wouldn't trust it with a large amount.  Small amount or multi-sig it's great for.

It does support multiple, I don’t know if XRP is one of them since I only have BTC and Ether.  Also if you decide to get one don’t be fooled into thinking you need to use shapeshift.  Electrum has support for it built in like with trezor and ledger devices.

Correlation isn't necessarily causation.  People may not like it, but if Coinbase were leaking info it probably would have been found out by now.
