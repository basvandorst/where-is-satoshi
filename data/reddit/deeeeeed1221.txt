You know those vendors who sit inside the baseball stadium who sell the 8$ hotdogs? Hotdogs really aren't worth 8$ but you can't leave because they won't let you back in and you're really hungry. It's you're only option.  This is a similar situation. Nigeria is so corrupt but their new president is cracking down against corruption, more then any other nigerian leader in the past. The government has been funding million of ghost employee's, 5 billion dollars that was funded to fight boko haram was lost. This money has to go somewhere and the corrupt politicians in Nigeria need some place to store it. They know they might be paying a premium fir bitcoin but no one else is selling hot dogs for nigerian currency. There's no other option.

That would be a good thing though, no? I think this would only be useful until MMJ retailers, wholesalers, ect. can use federal banking. Until then they're left with a cash only buiz.

Its such a gray area. Unless you funneled like hundreds of thousands of capital gains and avoided taxes, then your probably alright.

Yeah I meant solely for this project not for the value of bitcoin.

Turns out he bought 30m worth of bitcoin anom and the gov cant find it. (not serious)

I think they should just give a grace period to all bitcoin investors, come out with specific cryptocurrnecy tax law and then go from there. Its classified as property. That hardly makes any sense. It would make more sense as an investment vehicle which is already similar to property but still would make it more clear. I think it might serve well to serve it as foriegn currency investment as well. The current rules right now are to vague. I've said all along that the IRS does not have the resources to go after all coinbase users but i'm sure they will go after the big fish.
 I still don't like the approach they are taking &amp; if its unreasonable its going to be a headache for them. They need specific tax code for this type of asset. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:14:58
????? I don't think the IRS has the authority to put a ban on Bitcoin. They can tax it heavily, but people will just have more incentive to evade it heavily. They're best bet is to come out with lenient tax code because of the history and anonymity of bitcoin its pretty easy to hide private keys if someone wants too.   
@_date: 2016-12-01 04:30:00
I feel like a lot of people who invested in bitcoins aren't necessarily tax evaders. But now that is what the media portrays as us. People who are associated with deep web gambling, drugs, ect. I'm sure those people are out there. But I think a lot of bitcoiners (us) believe in bitcoin as an investment and as an ideology. And it's not our fault that the IRS hasn't got ahead of the beast and now wants to look through over a hundred million transactions? No way. It wont happen. Come out with user friendly way for us bitcoiners to report or realized gains and losses, don't tax transactions and you might find out 10% of coinbases identities.

Why would it drop to 600's when its been stable at 700 for almost 3 months?
@_date: 2016-11-20 02:36:08
I mean until they come out with a specific tax law on cryptocurrency, its kind of just a crap shoot.

Nigeria is the most corrupt place on the earth. No wonder they're willing to pay so much, all the stolen oil monies is piling up in their homes.

Honestly this should be illegal. Essentially they're saying let me pump up my own coin from price manipulation, sell a shit ton of coins and reap in the profits while the coin tanks probably three weeks later. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 04:38:38
I agree. There are plenty of users who want to comply with the IRS. Which I would be very upset about is if they overtax bitcoin and throw heavy taxes on users. I also think taxing transactions is just a waste of time. The amount of transactions they would have to go through on a yearly base to make sure everyone is compliant is probably like 500 million. GOODLUCK
@_date: 2016-11-21 02:46:18
I'm just saying that quote was def not the point of the article. They're looking for people actively trying to commit tax evasion. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:10:45
Your ludicrous if you think it will result in the IRS gaining knowledge of every coinbase user. Not to mention, the type of logistics it would take to look through every transaction that a coinbase customer bought, sold, paid for something online. The IRS, too, has finite resources and this will be the case. Even if they were allowed to look through every single coinbase user, they don't have the resources to look through every single transaction and I doubt coinbase is going to do any of the sorting for them.  
@_date: 2016-11-20 21:13:36
lol'd. Yeah why can't these corrupt politicians just keep funding their on personal bank accounts. Its not fair!
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:28:58
Ok I could see 680's and 670's but its still a guess. I thought you were implying we were likely to see 600's as in like 610 620, ect. As of late though, if you measure volatility, bitcoin is the most stable it has ever been in its lifetime. So it's unlikely that it would drop to 200 or rise to 1000 in one day.

I honestly think this is a great idea for US marijuana sales until federal legalization happens.

coinbase has three million customers at the end of 2015. Probably around 5-6 million now. You're telling me the IRS is going to look through ~50 million transactions (very conservative estimate) and on an individual basis look when a customer bought a coin, at what price, then record the transaction and see what the bitcoin price was during the transaction, and then do that 50 million times.  Thats ludicrous. They don't have the resources. Will they go after the big fish? Most likely. Will they go after the newbie with one to five bitcoins, absolutely not.  
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:08:01
Keep fighting the good fight. They know THEY don't wont to look through billions of transactions. :)

I can't tell if your serious or delusional. Ill go with the latter.

I've always wonder, do they get the money they scammed when they get out? I'd do four years in prison for 64m TBH.
@_date: 2016-11-20 02:32:52
With that being said, I feel the people worried have sheltered less than 10,000$ from the IRS through bitcoin. One if you didn't sell and make capital gains you're not even subjected to federal capital gain taxes and two if its not a material amount for the IRS to actively pursue, they won't pursue it. They simply don't have the resources to go after each coinbase customer or even come close. If you're not doing any of the things above, you probably don't have much to worry about. Unless you bought in at 30$ and sold at 1100$, then the IRS wants your gain tax money.
