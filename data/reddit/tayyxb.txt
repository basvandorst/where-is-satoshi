The only value it holds is the price, it's so inconvenient and the fees are ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:50:37
Okay so BTC won't crash? Invest more and more and more?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:06:03
basically. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:56:49
Thank you for this! Didn't know this previously so this will definitely be helpful.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:09:56
I wish I could do this. Congratulations bud.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:48:10
I think most plan on retiring within the next 5-10 years, let alone 23!
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:49:49
That's insane man. Happy for you, well done.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:15:46
you reckon? What do you have in mind?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:33:17
Honestly, huge respect to you my friend. I wish you the best in life and utmost respect to you for providing support to charitable causes. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:30:09
Do you mean fees or an additional charge on top? Nobody has a clue what you're talking about and I've just realised your account is deleted. RIP.

20k before the end of the year, more or less guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:49:25
I wonder how long it'll last though, I'm seriously hoping all this bubble fiasco is false!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:38:30
Come on dude, I hope you're joking 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:32:31
I feel like it's been too long for it to be classed as a bubble now, it may drop in price but inevitably it'll rise again regardless. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:41:47
That's insane, people are willing to take crazy amounts of risk; but glad it worked out for him in the end.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:34:28
Why are huge amounts of BTC being donated? Am I missing something here? Hello I could do with some too?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:29:28
So how much are they actually?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:58:33
I'm happy for you man, wish I had made the right decision when I had the chance.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:15:35
Lol can only wish.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:12:07
Congratulations man!! Wonder how many other people have hidden bitcoin just sitting around.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:48:59
Not sure it'd be worth selling with the ridiculous fees, but hey ho
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:46:51
Oh wow, it is a huge amount. I hope you get it all resolved, I would be extremely pissed and worried if I was in your situation right now! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:03:19
Ah them ones, yeah I can imagine that happening too if I mentioned anything to my friends or family.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:30:37
Asking for no upvotes is asking for upvotes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:48:14
Does anybody even know who he is?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:47:31
Explaining Bitcoin to parents is possibly the hardest thing ever. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:33:38
Lol this was good. Congratulations my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:08:42
This is great, one spelling typo and it's now a term being used by thousands. Ah I love the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:06:47
Ah man, you should have holded on for another 6 months! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:12:55
Thank you. Will be taking a look at this shortly.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:47:24
Wait I want to know, did your sister scam you?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:04:33
I hope to god there's a $6-7k correction because best believe I've investing hard in that shit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:10:16
Wait what? I thought they were sub $100. Wow.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:34:53
That's not too bad for a pair I guess
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:28:14
What gives you that impression? Would love to see your view on it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:09:17
Can probably count on that. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:23:16
I don't think most people would to be fair, so if you're one of those that would. Fair play to you.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:37:58
pop pop pop!
