Clearly it wouldn't be $10m in 2025 if you were to follow this "trendline". If you were to add a 0 for every year you'd be at $1m in 2017, and thus $10m in 2018, $100m in 2019, etc. It wouldn't be a trendline if we end up at $1m by 2024, not in regards to the current history. It would be a stagnation in trendline by a vast amount.

The Norwegian economy is quite stable and there are no plans to stop selling oil within at least 60-70 years when our expected oil supply will start running out. The shutdown of Justcoin has to do with the sudden change in regulation from the banks. They decided not to allow digital currency alltogether and won't let Justcoin continue operations in cooperation with the banks. Thus they can't take out any money from digital currency gains (which is how they get their fees (thus income)).

$10,000 would require a significant change in adoption tendency as well as massive investment through the developing infrastructure. I'm not gonna say for certain whether something is possible or not, because quite frankly if you think about it, who the hell would have estimated the magnitude of the late-2013 rally? 
In my mind, anything is possible when it comes to Bitcoin and its adoption rate. It would however require some significant traction to get to $10,000 by the end of the year.
As far as I can estimate, in order to get the kind of traction required, you would need some of, or all of the following things to happen:
- Massive adoption from some of the biggest companies in the world, think Walmart, Facebook, Apple, Comcast, Ebay, Amazon etc (not saying either are likely to, just posting examples)
- Massive media focus from the biggest channels, magazines and newspapers around the world. 
- Political focus and influential politicians siding with Bitcoin and using it as a tool to promote their own personal agenda. 
- Increase in funding and investment for upcoming infrastructure companies such as Coinbase, Bitpay and so forth. 
Now, while I am nothing but an optimist in the long-run, and would wish nothing but success for bitcoin in most aspects, I have my doubts for anything close to $10k by the end of the year. Something about a $120-140 billion market cap seems a little far-fetched, but then again, so was $12 billion a year ago.

That is exactly what I'm doing. I think we misunderstood each other. My main sources of information stem from articles well outside the bitcoin community space, and what I meant by frequenting these subs is basically that I use them as a platform to find new sources as well as look for the few threads that have solid content. It's not about only reading from the most neutral sources possible, it's also about knowing how to filtrate information and know what's what. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:52:25
I think my average buy-in is somewhere around $610. I bought in the rally, a few months after the rally and about 50% of what I own just recently. Managed to hit pretty close to the bottom at $305 a few weeks ago, so that's nice:)

Bitcoin is not a stockmarket. Bitcoin is apples. Stocks are oranges. Its might share a lot of similarities, but there is a fundemental difference in the way bitcoin is completely decentralized and has no incentive, thus not functioning like a company with shares.

A very large portion of Justcoin's userbase are in fact Norwegian. It's the actual banks in Norway that are prohibiting any dealings with digital currency, thus it will be entirely impossible for Justcoin to keep going in Norway. The two guys that are running Justcoin are Norwegian young adults that probably don't want to move to another country and rather do something else and stay in Norway. They are not losing much by closing down, simply because they have had a steady income and they don't have much value in physical inventory, seeing as they simply operate an exchange. It makes sense, and any rational entrepreneur would've done the same. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:41:01
You don't really come across as a cool dude by crashing into the sub yelling "the fuck", but I'll be GGG anyway and advice you to do some research on the subject. There is a reason for 117.000 subscribers to this subreddit and the several $billion circulating in Bitcoin already. Search the web, read some articles and try to keep an open mind. Once you got the basics, search up Andreas Antonopoulos and Stefan Molyneux on youtube and check out their extremely informative videos about Bitcoin. 
In my experience, there are very few people who reject the idea and potential of bitcoin after having done proper research on the subject. By that I don't mean an hour of reading a few articles, but some properly invested time til you get a thorough understanding.

Volatility has never been the issue. The concern was that once/if Bitcoin ever becomes a global, competitive currency, will it still be volatile? No one cares too much about bitcoin's volatility when it is merely in its infancy and no one uses it as a real currency. Anyone who uses bitcoin at the moment are either sitting on it expecting a rise in price, or use it through an application like bitpay.
Until bitcoin becomes fully grown and reaches its maximum potential, we won't know for sure if it will remain stable enough to use as a real currency, and that's where the true danger lies.

I'm not a drug dealer, don't worry. I'm quite well off economically, and being Norwegian certainly helps in general. $20k at my "average buy in" would have me at well above 30 BTC, so I'm not even remotely close to that I'm afraid.

I'm a Norwegian myself actually. I have absolutely no idea where you've got the statistics for our unsustainable wealth or bankruptcy. Norway has had a slow decline in economic progression after decades of prosperity. There are no real indications of unsustainable wealth and although we have less lower disposable income than Americans and other nations, you need to keep in mind that with increased globalization, we are technically better off in general as we increase our disposable income when it comes to any international service outside of the country.
Our healthcare system has issues though, I agree. However, it has had the potential to be a great healthcare system all along, but our politicians have made the wrong choices. This has nothing to do with the system itself, imo. If healthcare was entirely private, I sincerely doubt we would have better results.

Well, good and bad news then I suppose.
The bitcoin infrastructure is growing immensely. There is more than $300 million in investments for companies and organizations that are working actively to develop software and make changes to the new infrastructure that is being put forth. This essentially means that all of these changes that we desperately need for wide adoption, is in progress.
However, in the next few years, there will be a lot of regulatory changes as well, as nations and states determine what they want to do with bitcoin in regards to taxes, fees and banking-related rules. This will hold some of these in-progress changes away and most likely prohibit some of the innovation that is in the works. 
In total though, I believe Bitcoin, as an international innovation, has tremendous potential and capability, and thus I certainly hope we'll be able to overcome these obstacles and change the financial system for the better.

Andreas is absolutely, mind-blowingly amazing at relaying the thoughts and ideals of this community, as well as taking into account that he needs to be spot-on with the norms and ideas of the listeners (in this case the Canadian senate) in order to not seem like a gloomy fanboy who sees any criticism or negative response through a narrow tunnel. I was close to applauding at the conclusion of the meeting, but luckily reminded myself that I live with others and that would make me seem really weird. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 12:05:32
There is usually a 0.5% fee when trading bitcoin on an exchange. The reason for the high fee (which is constant btw, not $10 + 0.5%, but 0.5% flat) is because of the relatively small market. As the exchanges grow bigger, and more competitive, the fees will be reduced for trading purposes. 
As for the transaction fees, no they won't be increased over time. Either Bitcoin succeeds or it doesn't, and if it does, the price per bitcoin will be moving alongside the increasing difficulty in mining, thus keeping profits steady for those who still remain competitive in the mining space. If mining turns unprofitable for some people, they won't collectively increase fees, they will shut down their mining rigs and move along. There is even talk of lowering transaction cost as the network grows bigger.
As a last note, e-wallets that have withdrawal fees are very easy to avoid, thus eliminating the problem entirely.
Bitcoin is in its infancy. There is growth problems for sure, but to say that it is not advantageous over traditional payment options, when you are determined to overcome the hurdles of all the hassle that comes with buying bitcoin, is absolutely absurd and ignorant. The potential for the blockchain platform and the bitcoin network is absolutely mindblowing, and $300 million is a testament to the faith people have in said potential. Give it time, let it grow, and see what comes of it.

Peter Schiff might have predicted the 2008 recession, but he is also currently a massive bitcoin doubter whose primary argument is that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Watch his discussion with Stefan Molyneux for some perspective on how the man thinks. I'm personally not a big fan of his, although I do believe he has some solid knowledge of economics. 
On another note, I strongly disagree with the notion that anyone who does not have a master degree in economics or detailed knowledge of the different technical analysis methods or such as, is not qualified to make their opinion through rational logic based on basic knowledge of economics in society. Of course, it does indeed help to have extended knowledge, but it does not serve as a rightful argument to say that "because you do not have a certain degree or massive experience, you are not qualified to make a solid, logical, rational opinion on the matter"
@_date: 2014-05-25 10:37:31
Your logic does not include a few vitally essential aspects of politics or business for that matter. You can't run a government based on constant voting, because the minute you were to include an unpopular decision in your plan you would be thrown out of office or be denied the right to run certain strategies.
In politics it is essential that politicians are able to lay out and plan full-on strategies to get efficient work completed. You need to make certain "unpopular to the general public" decisions in order to serve the full-purpose of whatever strategy is planned out. If you were to have a constant-voting system you would simply never get things efficiently done. 
Whether or not you agree with this is completely up to you, but history and simple logic will show how irrefutable this theory in fact is. One of the major reasons for political inefficiency or business inefficiency is the constant craving for immediate results. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:38:01
While I agree on many of your statements, I simply cannot fathom how people can't see the potential applications of Bitcoin from a GLOBAL perspective, rather than restrict their view to the western world. The technological growth of the entire continents of Africa, Asia and South America is tremendous, and to not even consider that 15-20 years from now they may prosper and gain from a technology like bitcoin, or other blockchain based currencies, is short-sighted to say the least. 
I genuinely believe the blockchain technology is one of the greatest inventions of our modern era, and opens up opportunities for so many aspects of our lives and economic structure. Whether Bitcoin is the platform that will be used going forward, or another invention completely trumphs is yet to be known. However, completely denying the potential of Bitcoin to be greatly successful in the future is ridiculous. 
People seem to mostly base this opinion on a few youtube videoes and comments they've read as well. I have yet to see a rational discussion on in-depth economic principles and reflection of our economic structure and the foresight of our economic advancement related to bitcoin, that somehow points to the factual error of bitcoin and why it has to fail, and something else has to emerge from the ashes.
