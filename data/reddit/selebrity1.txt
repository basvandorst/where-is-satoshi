I use to have no problems with coinbase. 
I live in the U.S. Last purchase I made a few weeks ago, coinbase hit me with some international charge, which resulted in my bank account getting froze for a few days until they were able to figure out where the international purchase came from.
Coinbase really is going to shit.

I need to go trick or treating at this house
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:02:54
Actually yeah. When someone's calling it a failure at 17 days sure. I see nothing wrong that.
It's not like I'm using it to say it's better or going to be worth more. 
All I'm trying to say is people calling it a failure at 17 days need to open they're eyes. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:12:14
Lack of succes. It's been around 17 days and worth over 400 dollars. I don't see how that's is not considered a success. 
Bitcoin was worth how much 17 days after creation?  So was bitcoin a failure to you cause fiat was worth more than btc within the first 17 days it came out? What was btc worth like a thousandth of a penny? I rest my case. I'm a btc holder too and yes I support bcash. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm just glad I'm not one of the blind core minions

Bcash will not fail or the 2x. The fact all this propaganda had to be pushed just so core can have they're way is proof. They may never get to btc's price ever. That doesn't make them a failure. 
Too big of pussies to give a actual fair fight
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:28:34
You really can't call it a failure when it's been around for two weeks and btc has been around what 9 years.  Failure and you dipshits hoping it fails are 2 different things.
I'm willing to bet in 9 years it's still here.

Google home and Siri been doing this for months now. I've had my google home for about 4 months now and it's always told me the bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum price

Even if they brokered it. Wouldn't one of they're traders have made the purchase.
Didn't he say he would fire any of his traders for trading it on the grounds of being dumb. 
He profited from it. Bottom line 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:33:40
I agree 100% 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:35:59
Doesn't matter. If one of his traders were involved that he stated he would fire for trading bitcoin on the grounds of being dumb then they're guilty as charged
This was manipulation at his finest. Notice how he did it during this china ban scare? He knew that comment alone couldn't tank it like he did. 
This was well thought out manipulation

Awesome! I been giving my nephew .1 for his birthday and Xmas every year since he turned 1. He’s 4 now and probably the wealthiest 4 year old in the neighborhood lol
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:44:26
Yes they are. Go to yobit. Been trading for a few mins already
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:31:59
Exactly. What he did is fraud, unethical and immoral. I'm closing my accounts with them Monday because of that stunt. Not like it'll make a difference to them. And That's fine, as long as they're not making a penny off of me anymore I did my part
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:51:46
That’s what’s happening now. Already trading on yobit and Mainet isn’t even running yet. Talk about a cash grab
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:45:44
They’re not but it’s already trading at yobit
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:45:00
Yeah they are go to yobit
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:49:21
Nice! Same with some of the btc i've given my nephew, a nice chunk is up 10x or more. It'll be interesting to see where btc is at in a few more years.
@_date: 2015-11-14 18:31:40
Yes, yes they do. I was one of them but sold at market value at the time $340 range not close to $2200. Gemini shut down a couple hours after that trade, not instantly. I had time to make a few trades after.  After that trade I made a purchase like ten dollars cheaper then sold again, repurchased then sold again. They reversed all of my trades afterwards and I'm now in the negative more than I would be from just that one trade, they reversed everything after that trade that resulted from that trade. I didn't lose allot, but it's principal after I get out of the negative I'm pulling everything all of my cash and btc. My accounts locked right now I can't withdraw, I cant even withdraw my returned btc until I get out of a negative dollar amount that I should not even be in. I can afford to get out of negative but all of my cash and btc are locked in trades. Why do I need to make a sacrifice or loss so they can please someone else? Really unprofessional move on they're end
@_date: 2015-11-14 18:19:17
Only thing is Gemini is not a bank, they're a exchange, huge difference. They're nothing more than a middle man really, that's how they get paid. It's not like they're protecting a customer from fraud or something. They should have security features on the site to protect customers from paying 5x to much on btc instead of reversing trades
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:06:05
are they going to reverse the order like Gemini did yesterday?
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:44:29
It's a bad move on theyre end. I was involved in that trade but sold at market value at the time $340 range. After that trade happened I made a few smaller trades and earned a little more btc. When they did the reversal THEY REVERVESED ALL OF MY TRADES AFTER. I'm now in the negative more than I would have been from that one trade. Yet they still advertised on theyre site that the trade happened. Shame on them for shitty business. Do I think the guys money should be returned to a extent, possibly. maybe every dollar spent over $500 or something, but not market value. Great way to screw the average guy Gemini!
