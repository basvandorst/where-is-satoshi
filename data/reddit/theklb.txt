It topped out at 20k and then dropped, what seemed like, 10% daily until it bottomed out somewhere around 3k. Been over a year and a half and still hasn't recovered.
The price is controlled by a select few and will likely never become stable. Shit is super volatile. Closest thing we'll see to stability is when the price is in the $100,000's and a $2,000 swing is negligible since it's only a 1-2% movement. We would also need better distribution of bitcoin to (more wallets holding coins) add stability to the price

Happened to me a few times before I stopped using them. They cancelled transactions and gave the reason "high risk". Bought X amount of BTC at ~$400 and it went up too ~$650 while it was pending. They canceled the order. This was after I had established a history with them.

Saying its untraceable didn't help the argument. All transactions are public and traceable. I think you meant to tell him "anonymous". Just look at whats going on with Mt Gox and BTCe. That guy slipped up by linking himself to a wallet associated with money laundering.  
  
Criminals used FIAT currency too... does your dad want to do away with that as well?

Coinbase will also hold your order until the price also profits them. Want to buy a large amount when the market is on a huge upswing? Good luck...

He said "at least a year ago" so he could have got .15 BTC when it was in the $375 range in February 2016. Transferred away the $42 worth in June 2017. Still have $500+ worth today.
