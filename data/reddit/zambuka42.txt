It really is. Thanks.. and cool that it can be monitored by everyone. I felt weird receiving donations and thinking I was the only one privy to it. Didn't seem right. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:28:02
Right.On. That sounds perfect. Thanks
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:09:17
Thanks. Obviously we can't afford the bandwidth to store a wallet here. But I used a remote control service to setup the wallet on a pc in the states. Then I backed up the key and wallet to my ftp. Had no idea how long it would take to sync.. or how much space it take!
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:27:38
?  
   
*Edit*: That was my curt reply because I had no idea what that meant.. we've now gotten a few changetips and it's awesome. Thanks for alerting me to this
@_date: 2016-06-05 16:13:59
Honestly, it's very little.. but we can use every $!! It's only .185 (about $100). 
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:48:44
Actually, I was doing it in the main body of the post.. but someone showed me this:


@_date: 2016-06-05 17:11:54
sweet, it all depends on how we can create another bank account somewhere and transfer the $ without a large cut. But I appreciate the info
@_date: 2016-06-06 07:30:52
Sorry for taking so long to get back... The software we use is called Trbonet for dispatching, vhf management, and connecting with Google earth to track gps signals.

Again.. newbie to this and pretty busy.. I stupidly used Bitcoin Core (good thing I installed it on a remote US-based PC... it used up 77GB!!!). I have the backed up wallet.dat file &amp; my pass-phrase. Is it easy to transfer management of the wallet to an online wallet?
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:42:36
Thank you very much. Truly appreciated
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:00:45
You rock. Thank you kind internet stranger. I feel like I'm about to start a journey down a rabbit-hole.. but well worth it. I'll check out the changetip stuff. :)
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:37:01
That is simply incredible. I'm keeping all the staff here in the loop. Appreciated :)
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:07:52
really awesome man.. thanks :)
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:53:10
not a bad idea.. I must know SOMEONE that uses BTC
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:06:12
I appreciate the thought.. but we are in the most geographically remote location in all of Africa.. not too many folks around.. or that can trade bitcoin. :) but thanks
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:14:16
Valid. I appreciate the concern, I'd be as suspicious.. but I didn't come here to GET btc.. just trying to work out what to do with what we got. But if anyone WANTS to donate.. we'd be beyond grateful. As far as proof, you can see the proof I provided in the main body of the AMA text :) ... but good lookin' out  
   
*Edit*: sorry, I misunderstood what you meant. I thought you were warning people about donating. As far as doing a transaction with someone.. I was also curious how both parties can participate in a trustworthy way..
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:41:50
Thanks alot, I'd say hi five back.. but then I think that means I have to return it :)
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:43:20
I guess since as a whole, over $500 has been donated by you guys... We will definitely paint the bitcoin logo just like we promised in the crowdfunding to paint people's names. Thanks alot buddy
@_date: 2016-06-06 07:06:18
Will Do
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:13:29
That's very nice of you. Probably best to wait until this all settles  down. You guys actually donated a very nice amount :) and I'll take the recommendation and let it sit for a bit and check out the sites/debit cards etc. But I'll send you a PM anyway and we can talk. Thanks man. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:43:12
Actually, I'm the only US citizen. I will definitely be checking that out
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:41:52
Wow, thanks for that.. never even heard of chanetip. Thanks so much @_date: 2016-06-05 19:10:09
I wasn't either :) And we've got black paint. Maybe we could swing orange..

@_date: 2016-06-05 20:37:49
Holy crap thank you! Power's been off for a while and my laptop is gonna die in a sec.. but wanted to give my thanks. That is so awesome! 
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:04:20
Are there multiple providers? Recommend any one in particular?
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:17:29
Of course I'd be happy to.. thanks! We are  We did that AMA linked above after had I let loose a very gratifying tirade against M$ that made it to the front page. We already had a crowdfunding thing setup for our crashed airplane, and then I decided to add a bitcoin address to take a venture into this world  
   
   
**[Indiegogo's Generosity Site](  
   
And our Bitcoin: **14bNP5krJeBPGT6xYWdfQYD4veNC9nLiib**   
   
   
I didn't come here to solicit donations.. but of course we are grateful for any generosity. I appreciate you asking.. I wasn't going to post it.  
   
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:45:35
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:59:13
We would absolutely do that!  
   
... right next to Planey McPlaneface
@_date: 2016-06-06 13:25:29
I just saw that. Thanks so much!
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:22:14
So cool! Thanks alot! 
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:42:25
That's good advice. I'm definitely going to learn everything about this. I've known for years, but never ventured into it myself
@_date: 2016-06-06 07:33:54
roger that
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:04:11
:) the company that makes the software gave the computer long before windows 10 was trying to upgrade. They preinstalled everything... and people living in the bush had no reason to suspect microsoft would try to force something on them. Nobody here should have been expected to prepare for any of this.
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:38:47
This is a dry camp. No booze.. no women.. just a boot-camp style life out here. There *are* baboons, but they don't like to cuddle. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 15:52:17
nice, thanks! (We don't have one of those accounts, but maybe we can get one)
