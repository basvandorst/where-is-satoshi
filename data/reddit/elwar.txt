You can edit the Bitcoin code yourself. Download the code, add the message "Ihmed rulez" in every transaction.
Now release that code to the public. If enough people like your change, they will use your wallet.
There is not a single "bitcoin code". But the protocol is same among all iterations, otherwise it is not Bitcoin.
If the protocol is changed then miners, exchanges, users will need to use the new protocol from then on. Otherwise it gets put in the history books like Bitcoin Classic.

Now that I think about it, they want the information you see on your bank account when you receive your paycheck. Basically they give you a direct deposit number but I doubt they have a unique one for each person so they want to know where it comes from in order to know who the deposit is associated with.

It would be useful for a bot to pay people for upgrading its code and also for creating a source of income which uses its own code.
For example, the coders give it decent enough AI to the point that it can interact with people.
It then pays a programmer to create a website where the AI chats with people, somehow generating revenue. The bot could pay royalties to the original programmer over time.
That AI could also be used for other applications as the bot grows in functionality. Each person getting royalties as the utility of the bot grows.

There are both one-way ATMs and two-way ATMs. Many just sell bitcoin. Some buy and sell bitcoin.
I can say that I am very glad that I found a bitcoin ATM in Ho Chi Minh. I had run out of Vietnamese dong and there was a very convenient bitcoin ATM near my hotel. I fed it bitcoin, it took my phone number and sent me a text once the transaction went through. I came back to the ATM with the code it sent me and retrieved my fiat.
Less security risk. It is actually better in most cases than an exchange that does KYC/AML. More of your personal information is more securely yours.  
Most ATMs that sell bitcoins give you a receipt with your private key. So no wallet needed from the company. Localbitcoins tends to be better but these are useful.

Not sure why it is related to Bitcoin but I have cut back on my drinking (not that I drank a lot, but I have decided that I'm going to be good to my body going forward). I date but marriage is not an option, I told my current gf that I'm never getting married. She acts like it's ok. I have become a minimalist though I think I always have been, just never to the extent I currently do it. I love video games but would rather do something productive (just sold my PS4 as it takes up too much space in my suitcase).
I suppose the health aspect for me is that I figure with Bitcoin I might be able to catch the transhumanist technology in time for the tipping point (the idea that at some point humans will no longer die of old age, but whether or not you can live long enough to get to that technology is another question). I believe that the first few people to take advantage of the technology and live longer will need to have the money to be part of it.
So my main financial goals are to retire (check) and live forever. But why live forever if you're just going to sit around doing nothing. The final goal is to live a life worth living (viva ut vivas).

Not a lightning expert but you have to have your BTC online to open the channel (I believe with more than one person in order to be a node). I'm not sure of security measures that can be placed on the BTC. I had some ideas of how to do it with cold storage but I am not an expert and have not delved deep enough to see if it's possible or not. For now it's good that a lot of people are creating small nodes in a very decentralized way.  
Edit: And I'm not spinning it. The response Andreas gave to the early criticism by bcashers before LN got started was about centralization. The bcashers felt that we would have a hand full of banks that were the main nodes that everyone would have to go through, making it no better than the current banking system. Andreas responded that the fact that they are hot wallets would end up with a lot of people with very small amounts in their nodes. And that's exactly what is happening.
@_date: 2018-09-15 21:44:23
The key to lightning (right now) is that you need to have your BTC in a hot wallet. Many people are not willing to put a whole bitcoin on a server. This is actually a good thing. The thought was that we would see just a hand full of 1000 BTC nodes that would control the entire network and centralize everything. But putting 1k BTC online is just asking for hackers. This hot wallet requirement ensures decentralization. Many people are willing to risk $100 worth of BTC on a node.

While not directly Bitcoin related, my late wife passed away partially from financial problems. Mainly in that if I did not have to go off to Afghanistan to make money to get us through some big debt I would have been there to save her. This was in 2013 and I had bought 800 BTC in 2011 so we both went through the long downturn. Had she lived one more month our money troubles would have been over forever.
The key is to not play the "what ifs". Money was just one factor. Drinking was a major one, prescription pills (Xanax) were other major factors. The final factor was a terrible sleeping pill (while she was withdrawing from Xanax) that has a side affect of "could cause death". 
Everyone who knows her wishes they could have been there that day. I even sent a facebook message to a friend asking to go check up on her, I didn't know the little red symbol meant the message didn't go through. Again, realize that it's nobody's fault. It's not your fault. Nothing will change what happened. Hold onto the good memories you have, don't let them fade.

While everything purchased from Blue Frontiers will be in varyon, private businesses on the seastead can use whichever currency they like. I assume bitcoin will thrive there.
The reason why Blue Frontiers had to go the currency route is because of the international nature of the project and with the amount of laws in the various countries about securities and ICOs, raising money through a security was next to impossible at this point in time. Especially in the US. Using varyon for all payments you are roughly getting a piece of the company by owning varyon without needing to go through the process of securities laws.
A Singapore-&gt;Gibraltar company run by Americans, European, Russian, Polynesian building in French Polynesia getting funding from all over the world does not fit into any securities models that make sense. A currency used by a local jurisdiction does.

"No. Teachers' pay is not a meaningful part of the government budget. To lower the deficit, a congress would have to collect more taxes, or cut the big spends, which are social security (not an easy sell), medicaid/medicare (very efficient programs that are also politically impossible to cut), or military (totally do-able, and liberals want to, but conservatives would never)."
I know this, you know this, but they will never touch the third rail spending that is the real problem. McCain's solution to overspending was "earmarks". Which account for .0000001% of the budget. And this simple solution won him the nomination. Other such "fixes" such as cutting spending on tiny budgets is just window dressing.
"I generally agree, but I'm curious relative to what you think it must stop growing. GDP, inflation, interest rates, some combination thereof?"
It needs to stop growing relative to revenue. When we reach the point where all revenue coming in is equal to all interest payments, we've sort of left the realm of reality when it comes to government spending numbers.
I have done a lot of country shopping and I like Costa Rica where their Constitution mandates a balanced budget. But it has already become too popular with Americans so housing prices have gone up significantly.
The only reason we can continue our large deficits is because the dollar is the world reserve currency. If tomorrow nobody is buying our debt, then we would either have to print money to cover our deficits or raise taxes (can only raise them so much to cover spending) or cut spending (won't happen politically). Of those three options, printing money is the most politically viable approach. Which increases inflation and further chases away people willing to finance our debt.
Of course, not everyone will stop buying our debt. But the less attractive it is the more strain toward inflation there will be.
It all puts different strains on different parts of the economy. Which creates symptoms all over the place. We will try to treat the symptoms without addressing the underlying fiscal problem.

I'm not saying it has to be 0%. Look at a family budget, they have credit card payments, they have mortgage interest payments. If they stay at a certain percentage of their budget then that's fine. But if they need to start opening new credit cards to pay the interest on their old credit cards then they're basically heading for bankruptcy. 
Interest is less than 7% of the budget? That's the budget, not revenue. When the government has huge deficits and has an even larger budget then percentage-wise it's not so bad right? 
If I make $3,300 per month and I pay interest payments of $280. Then I'm paying 8% of my monthy salary toward interest. But if I end up spending $4,000 that month then that interest payment drops to 7%. So...to get smaller interest percentages I can just spend even more. At $8,000 I'm only paying 3% toward interest payments.
The US government has been spoiled with historically low interest rates. When they come back to the average rate do you think perhaps those interest payments will rise as well? 
Again, the amount does not need to go to zero. There is no trigger number. It just has to stop growing. More debt means more interest which means higher numbers. 
Would interest at 100% of our revenue be a good thing or bad thing in your world? Totally sustainable if we're spending 10x our revenue because the percentage is only 10% of our budget. We can borrow to infinity and it will have no impacts whatsoever. The same catastrophic problems that would occur in such a case are the minor problems that we will see all the way up until then. 
As you say, Trump has raised the deficit, just as Obama did. There is no path forward where any president will be able to lower the deficit. The US public would not stand for it ("he wants to cut teachers pay!"). They never decrease the budget. So every higher budget only pushes us further toward a catastrophe.

I recall a large eared third party candidate raising the alarm when the debt was $3 trillion. Back when it may have been possible to change policy enough to address it.
At over $300 billion per year, our interest payments are the 4th highest spending item right after defense spending. People complain about spending on this program or that, maybe some change in wages or policy that may have a $1-2 billion effect on the budget. But when interest alone is rising by $20-$30 billion per year why even bother with saving anywhere else? It's not like there's any plan to make it any better.
Interest will continue to rise. They don't really care because they can just keep raising the debt, which raises interest payments in an endless cycle.
They can't raise enough revenue to pay for the rising interest. They can't cut spending to pay for it. The only solution they can politically accomplish is printing more money and lowering the value of the dollar so that those interest payments are not as difficult to pay.
"What amount of total government debt is OK to you?"
If it was stable and not rising so much every year it would be ok. Where interest on the debt rises at a very slow pace then it would not be so bad. If it is rising at the pace of a very low inflation rate (1-2%) then it wouldn't be much of a problem. 
I see no correction to the path we're headed. That's my main motivation for holding almost 100% bitcoin. I just can't see buying Federal Reserve Notes that have the built-in feature of losing value over time.
And if the problem isn't solved by tanking the value of the dollar, then they will go after people with money or high incomes. That's why I've moved out of the US and work toward positioning myself so I am not in a taxable income bracket. They can take money from the bank accounts like they did in Cyprus and Greece but they can't take my bitcoins.

Correct, it will be the only currency Blue Frontiers accepts. And Blue Frontiers is the company that will be granted control of the Special Economic Zone in French Polynesia. Even though other currencies can exist, it will be like fiat currency in that eventually you will need to convert into varyon to pay for whatever governance fees are required (like I said, visas, property registration, etc).
They could say the cost is 1 varyon at 100k usd for one month of rental but if nobody is willing to pay that much for one month then they get no business. The value will be the market price or they make no money.
They do have more details of the cost estimates and plans for the upfront funds in the white paper but yes, there is certainly uncertainty. But they definitely have first mover advantage in this field and the head start of a host nation.

The Rai stone was very much like Bitcoin.
They would expend a huge effort to get one of these to their island (they didn't have the stone on their island so someone had to take their boat to the other island, chisel this thing out then bring it back on their boat), so basically proof of work.
It would then sit in front of someone's house showing that they owned it. But these things were huge, so if the owner wanted to transfer it to someone else he gathered the whole village together to officially pass it on to the next person. Instead of moving the stone they just left it there, but everyone knew who owned it.
If that guy wanted to transfer it they again gathered the whole village and gave a full list of all of the previous owners. They would have generations go by and everyone could tell the full history of who owned which stone.
During one of the journeys to get a new stone there was a storm on the way back and the stone fell to the bottom. But they still considered it legit. It had the same value as the others even though nobody could see it nor touch it (in essence, a virtual currency).

Initially it will be solely the seastead ecosystem, negotiations are being done with travel agencies and airlines to French Polynesia.
Paying for property, timeshares, rentals, e-residency, blockchain based governance, blockchain voting, etc.
Since it will essentially be building a city from the ground up there is a big push for making most things blockchain based from property registration to p2p electricity/Internet, passports, visas, etc.
There are many cryptocurrencies out there, using a single hub currency will allow for a standard to be created around that currency first and expanding to others later.

My computer had 6 different 50+ character passwords to get through before they could get to my private keys. Must have pissed those Stasi off. They probably figured they held the mother load of all Dark Web crime on that computer.
The reality is I had copies of my keys elsewhere. As soon as they stole my shit I moved my bitcoins somewhere else.
They took the longest they could legally take to return it all (of course, because I wasn't doing anything illegal, buying bitcoins is legal in Germany even if you're buying from a polish exchange).

I have a bit of a theory about the IMF's positive stance on crypto from a bit of inside knowledge.
The head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, has said many positive things about blockchain over the past year or so, more on that in a moment.
Gespard Koenig is a libertarian (french version) who is currently an adviser for Blue Frontiers, the seasteading company ( He is a very popular political figure who knows his shit, going on TV letting the french know that the libertarian ideals are rooted in their French Revolution, he is like a young Ron Paul. He runs a libertarian think tank akin to Cato Institute in the US. He is very bullish on bitcoin and blockchain technology for it's libertarian implications.
Several years ago Gespard was the speech writer and adviser to Christine Lagarde. He still keeps in contact and has her ear. 
So in a way, the libertarian Gespard Koenig is keeping the IMF grounded when it comes to blockchain policy as the head of the IMF trusts his knowledge of blockchain technology and appears to be following through on his recommendations.

Hmm, looks like they are making users use Coinbase as their wallet. I had considered making a competing company because of how lousy the interaction is with these sites. Looks like I might need to get started on that.

Yes, bitwage is like a reverse bitpay, they convert fiat to bitcoins without the company dealing with bitcoins. GD has no idea I am being paid in bitcoins, just sending my money to a direct deposit number I gave them.
Yes, I can convert different percentages of my paycheck because GD allows me to split my direct deposits into multiple accounts. I tested my first transaction with only $500 of my paycheck going to Bitcoin.

The site can process bitcoin purchases, working on allowing people to deposit cash to our bank account for the next step (similar to bitquick.co).
Then we will do credit cards.
Still not at the stage of offering the transfer to colored coins but the central database is set up. We really don't want to have central control of peoples' tokens.
The offering of transfer to colored coins is just a matter of adding the code, they have been created on coinprism.

Time? I meet people about 5 minutes from my home, so about 10 minutes round trip plus the 2 minutes or so to say hi and exchange cash/bitcoins.
About twice a week.
So I guess about 2 hours per month.
@_date: 2016-03-04 13:14:48
Sorry for the late response. They say that it is free but I have noticed that the exchange rate is usually about 1% higher than the price on most exchanges.
So basically they charge 1%.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:55:49
When I was paid they paid at a rate of $319/BTC while on Bitstamp the price was around $316. So it looks like they are getting around 1%
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:28:32
With this I eliminate the need for a bank account.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:16:07
The 10% doesn't pay my rent. My rent's only 900 euro, that's about 3 bitcoins per month. I have one guy that likes to buy 1 bitcoin every 2 weeks or so.

I spend $3000 per month on food, rent, bills, etc.
That is over 10 bitcoins per month I have to sell to survive.
Some estimates put total Bitcoin users at 500,000.
That is 500,000 people that need to spend 5 million bitcoins per month just to survive!
This means that every month a minimum of 5 million bitcoins need to be bought for the market to maintain a stable price.
Or maybe...just maybe...people invest in Bitcoin can afford their monthly expenses with their regular salaries and consider holding their bitcoins an investment. Or they spend them.
And maybe, you are beating the same lame ass drum that bears have been beating since the price was $5 and 7200 bitcoins had to be sold every day for miners.

I get paid 100% in bitcoins also. Set up a localbitcoins account for selling bitcoins for cash locally. Check to see what others in your area are charging and undercut them by about half (you have to make up for the fact that you have less reputation).
This should give you a steady stream of cash for spending on things like food, gas, going out, etc.
For online purchases use purse.io for Amazon purchases. Everything else on the Internet use Brawker. You may be able to pay some of your bills with Brawker if they can be paid online by a third party.
For taxes, just save up for next year. Find the tables for this year, or a calculator online and it should be close for next year. 
I am still looking for a way to pay regular bills with Bitcoin. There is one company I found but I have not had any feedback on it so I'm not trusting it.

@_date: 2017-03-14 12:25:48
I have all of my savings in Bitcoin. I have a job so what would it matter if it goes to zero? I still get a paycheck on Friday.
I have heard that some people have all of their money in accounts and investments valued in digital units denominated in dollars that don't actually exist (fractional reserve). This is very dangerous. When the value of that currency goes to zero not only will you lose all of your money, but you will also likely lose your job and not be able to feed your family.
PLEASE stop putting all of your savings in fiat!
As for volatility, the days of highly volatile bitcoin prices are over. People get excited when the prices move by 5%. When the price was under $10 then a 50% change was more common. If the price doubled or cut in half today it would be utter chaos.
The bitcoin price is less volatile than some currencies used today in many countries on a daily basis.

Bitcoin can handle most of the solutions the alts keep trying to implement, but it requires some intelligence to implement them.
The easy route is just to create an alt. That's just lazy.

Some people are ok with risk, some people are not. I would rather spend my money on something that may be risky but could make me rich instead of playing it safe. At least while I am young and have a stable job. I am also a minimalist with no debt so I make about 10x what my living expenses are. So living completely on Bitcoin when you do not spend much money is quite simple.

You should create an Excel spreadsheet for them to store their data. Then relabel it as "blockchain" and collect your bonus check then leave before they find out what you really did.
A blockchain will not reduce costs. In order to solve the Bizentine Generals problem you have to have more money pumped into the security of it than anyone else is willing to spend to stop it. How does that reduce costs?
Now, if you were trying to use the Bitcoin blockchain that already has millions of dollars a day pumped into it, then yes. You could reduce costs. But your company would just say "Bitcoin? You mean that drug/dark web/ponzi thing?".
Stick with the Excel idea. Then start your own competing insurance company with your bonus check and use the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin will eventually be worth zero dollars, rupees, dinar, euro, etc. Because those things will no longer exist.

Why not? People buy expensive new cars that lose value, big houses that suck money out of your pocket. Rocks and metal that they wear on their bodies that are some of the most expensive things in the world. If you're poor and you live paycheck to paycheck it's not likely you have any savings. Most people are in debt up to their eyeballs. I find that most people warning people against Bitcoin are those in deep debt. They have accepted debt and credit scores to be a natural part of how money works, which is what fiat basically is made of.

Everything I have seen shows that it cannot scale (one of the blockchain voting projects decided to use Bitcoin instead because they did not want to overburden ETH, and that was just one project). Also, having created the earliest version of what would be considered a DAO, I know for a fact that nobody ever uses it in real life. They love the theory but don't use it.

Not a LN expert but from what I have seen if the node you opened a channel with goes offline you can close your end at any time and the transfers up to that point get recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. As for the single time payment to a merchant as far as I can tell there will be networks of networks out there so maybe a "Coinbase network" will be connected to a "Bitstamp network" connected to another network connected....etc. Joining just one will likely connect you to a massive "cloud" of LNs. I suppose you can compare it to using your cell phone. Even though you may use Sprint and the merchant uses Verizon you can still talk to each other.
Only better because you can also be a node and have traffic come through you.

Lightning just took your scenario from never to 91 years. The next technology may take that to 50. Next one to 20, then 5 then 1...

A combination of a decentralized exchange like bisq plus a stablecoin plus atomic swaps between stablecoin and BTC will allow for a very decentralized way of getting bitcoins.
Localbitcoin traders have the most difficulty with volatility (they buy/sell bitcoins, then send the money to the exchange only to have their profit margins eaten up by the change in price). If that volatility is close to zero, then they can charge 1-2% and count on that profit always being there.

Even an offshore business that you own more than 10% of requires that you declare all sold capital as soon as the company sells it. Even if you do not take control of that money.
You can quit your job and live overseas for the rest of your life pulling out less than $38k per year and never pay any taxes as long as you don't have any other income.
You will pay 20% plus the AMT if you sell all $4 million.

But monthly bills are the easiest when it comes to spending. For most of my monthly bills I pay them when the bitcoin price is higher than it was the day I got paid. If the price is down the whole 2 weeks I can pay at my next paycheck. I have done this on bitcoin's long path down to $180 and it has only been a net gain for me.
For miscellaneous spending like going on a trip or a large Amazon purchase I wait for one of those days where the price jumps in value (5-10%). While people are cheering the price rise I'm booking my next vacation or submitting an Amazon purchase. If the price crashes, I just hold off until after my next paycheck.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:48:57
20%...you count the gain toward your earned income calculation. So if you sell $500k it considers your earned income as $500k which puts you in the higher income bracket which taxes your capital gains at 20%.

I did exactly this. Selling the house, moving to Germany (well, I already lived in Germany for a while before selling the house).
First and foremost, use itBit for such a large transaction. For me it took several weeks to get the money from the sale of my house into bitcoin. First you need to go in person to your bank and request the ability to do wire transfers (I think I had to specify the exact itBit wire account). About a month later you get a phone number and code to use (this is with Wells Fargo). Then you can only send a maximum amount per day (my max was $25k, by then I was in Germany). Get it all wired to itBit and request an OTC trade. They will talk to you on the phone and match you up with a buyer of $50k or so.
As for what you do once you are in Germany. If you have a bank account there you can use any of the European exchanges. Though I was able to live on bitcoin for about 90% of my spending in Germany so if you're smart you can figure out how to do that. Or just keep it in bitcoin and cash out what you need as you need it through the exchanges.

There have been a few blockchain approaches to decentralized websites for a while. Maidsafe allows you to store data in a decentralized manner (at least that's what they've been promising). Namecoin allows you to have a .bit domain name which can point to any address.
So my thought is that eventually there will be many websites out there utilizing these distributed file sharing sites that you can connect to through your browser using Namecoin.
Or some other solution like that. No idea when. I am hoping something will be as easy as opening a website in your browser but all of the backend stuff happening is decentralized.

What would be the difference between me having my bitcoins as my main currency and paying my monthly rent bill of $1600 with bitcoins and me selling bitcoins once a month at $1600 to pay rent?
Or, keeping $1600 of my paycheck to pay rent where that $1600 is in a currency that loses value over time, on purpose, or immediately converting my paycheck to bitcoins and reaping the gains of a currency whose value gains value over time, on purpose.
Not to mention the fact that I live in Korea and my landlord expects payment in Won while I am paid in dollars (automatically converted to bitcoins). While I could exchange my dollars to Won at a rate of 4-5%, I pay only 1% to convert my dollars to bitcoins and actually gain money by converting to Won due to the bitcoin price being much higher in Korea than in the rest of the world.
Not to mention that most things I purchase are from Amazon, where I get about 15% off using bitcoins.

Dave Kleiman, Craig Wright's friend. It is very likely that Wright knew Kleiman was Satoshi and likely helped him in whatever capacity he could.
Two big factors are that Kleiman was in the hospital toward the final months that Satoshi was active on bitcointalk where he stated "If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.". Soon after Satoshi stated he was "moving on to other things" Kleiman died.
Since Craig Wright knew that Kleiman was Satoshi he knew full well that if he were to out himself as Satoshi, the real Satoshi would not be able to dispute his claim. If Craig Wright did not know who Satoshi is, he would not have been so bold in his claim.

That is confirmation times. Transactions propagate throughout the whole Bitcoin network within seconds of submission. Everyone can see your transaction and the receiver can choose to accept the transaction.
Confirmations record that transaction to the blockchain. When there are more transaction than the 1mb allowed per block, many transactions have to wait to be added. SegWit will cut this down the size of each transaction, thus allowing more transactions per block.
If you compare bitcoin transactions to a credit card transaction they both take a few seconds to transmit. A bitcoin transaction is confirmed in 10 minutes on average but can take a little while longer. In order to ensure that your transaction is not reversed you usually wait about 3 confirmations. A credit card confirmation (the time you have to wait to ensure the transaction is not reversed) takes 210 days.

The chain of blocks (blockchain) is a decentralized ledger that is secured by computing power. Anyone with the most computing power can control what goes into that ledger. Computing power focused on continuing a valuable currency is the least vulnerable to someone with more resources taking control of that ledger.

While you may have been "gifted" BCH...they had no value when they were given. The fork was a gift to all Bitcoin holders of a separate chain which used the same addresses. Just as when Bitcoin had a hard fork previously and was then corrected. You still own those forked coins as well. But they were worth nothing. And your BCH was also worth nothing upon creation. Not until the first one was sold was it worth anything.
So you were given a zero dollar worth gift, then it gained in value. That likely means you need to pay capital gains on the gain in value on that gift.

Seeing that you were a "professional investor" I expected to come to this thread seeing a bunch of criticism of Bitcoin hiding behind your academic background as "proof". I was pleasantly surprised. To those that are professionals that criticize Bitcoin I usually ask if they are so good at their jobs, how did they not see Bitcoin as a good investment years ago?
As someone who has had 90-95% of my portfolio in bitcoins I would disagree with the 10% thing...we should plan to sell bitcoins for what? Fiat (with built in 7% loss per year)? Some asset that is currently protected by the government which is even more unstable than Bitcoin? Diversify is the mantra of the professionals because they make more money that way. You can't keep up with all of the financial sectors you're invested in so you should leave all of that to the professionals. If you do put all of your eggs in one basket but tend to that basket, you can succeed.

Don't worry about the swings. It'll all work out.

Though I did not look at this, the way it would happen in my mind would be to have a shit-ton of microtransactions back and forth selling one coin for the other.
Say the Bitcoin price is 1 BTC = 100 LTC. You both connect to your respective Lightning Networks on each coin.
A has 100 LTC and wants to buy 1 BTC from B.
A sends .00001 LTC to B.
B sends .0000001 BTC to A.
A sends .00001 LTC to B.
B sends .0000001 BTC to A.
Over and over and over again until all transactions add up to A having 1 BTC and B having 100 LTC.
At any time in that loop one of them can reneg. Not send the next transaction. The only loss in that case is .0000001 BTC and the transaction ends.
So very low risk.

I didn't say "money doesn't buy happiness", I said "nice shit will not make you happy". Nice shit is not necessities.
They even did a study about happiness and money and yes, not having money up to a point makes people unhappy because you are spending your time struggling to get through life. But once you reach the point where your basic needs are paid for, having more does not make you all that much happier.
I am not against having money, I have a lot of bitcoins, having enough bitcoins means my necessities are paid for...so much so that I no longer need to work as my first 4 needs will be paid for the rest of my life. To me, not having to worry about my basic needs for the rest of my life makes me very happy. Buying a Lambo would interfere with that, buying a fancy house and the latest gadgets and best clothes and every other consumer good pushed on us on a daily basis to try to make us "be happy" would interfere with that.
All I own can fit in a carry-on and a backpack even though I could afford whatever material items I would ever want. I have a post card from every place I have been to since college. It is getting to the point that the thing taking up the most space in my carry-on are my post cards.
I had the American dream of a two story house with a white picket fence, a BMW and Cadillac in the driveway, oceanfront property.

A friend of mine messaged me on Facebook saying he needed 25 bitcoins (about $70k at the time) for a family emergency, told me he would pay me back 30 bitcoins the next day.
I told him no, but was really curious...what kind of family emergency would need $70k worth of bitcoins in a day.
He posted the next day that he was hacked and fortunately nobody fell for it. Turns out they were able to hack his phone through T-mobile.
After enough thought, there is absolutely no reason anyone would need $70k worth of BTC in a day for an emergency...no hospital would take BTC, no last minute mortgage financing would need BTC.

Given the size of the Mexican cross-border payments market (almost $775,000,000,000 USD in foreign trade payments, and more than $25,000,000,000 in remittances), what’s happening right now is much bigger than the possibility of an Exchange Traded Fund Mexico's New Bill Could Be A Game Changer for Bitcoin(ETF) in the USA. The regulation over our activities might open the door to foreign trade multinational corporations, financial institutions such as money transmitters, hedge funds, insurance institutions and others to use our platform to exchange currency and perform cross-border payments more efficiently.
Now consider the Pension Plans Administrators in Mexico (AFORES). This institution has assets under management in excess of 4,004,702,000,000 MXN (about $215,306,559,139 USD). Some pension plan administrators have started to expand their horizon of investments, given the bad performance they all had in the last few months. Some have discovered bitcoin’s great performance over the years, but could not justify taking positions in the market… until now.

Essentially, some miners upgraded to 0.8 while others did not. A block came through that was compatible with 0.8 and it was let through, however the pre-0.8 platforms rejected it and continued on. Because pre-0.8 had more hashing power it continued down its path while the newer 0.8 went down their path.
A fix was created and 0.8.1 was released to fix it and people upgraded quickly.

Germany classified bitcoin as "private money". That is great and all because it's an official currency! Woo Hoo!!! Ok, now try to run a currency exchange in your own country. You may find that there are a ton of rules and licenses you need to get to have a professional exchange. It's like having pesos in the US. You can buy them from someone individually, you can use them at a store that accepts them, but you can't set up a USD/Peso exchange without jumping through a ton of hoops. Localbitcoins had to stop German traffic because the government considered them an exchange. Even though buying/selling bitcoins from one person to another is totally legal. So be careful when you wish for bitcoin to be considered an official currency in your country.

Banks initially hoped this whole "Bitcoin" thing would die and go away. After it did not die they decided that the only way to stop it was to build their own "blockchain" and use it for their back-end transactions. Many people who do not understand why Bitcoin is great trying to replicate it but without that nasty "decentralization, native cryptocurrency or maximum amount". R3CEV is one such example of one of the early bankers turned Bitcoin developer turned banker again (trying to destroy Bitcoin on his way out with cries of 'Bitcoin's dead') trying to do such a thing.

I don't trade my bitcoins for other currency. I trade it for goods, rent, food, etc.
Those "things" provided by the government are given away freely are they not? Or do they come with the conditions that you must appreciate them? Do you believe anyone receiving federal aid must pledge fealty to the government?
There is a difference between giving away stuff and taking from people. Just because you give stuff away, does not justify taking from people. It is a bit simple minded to believe that stealing from people to pay for things is the best form of government.

There are other currencies but it is not necessarily the BTC/USD value that matters so much as the spending power of each bitcoin. I have noticed that as the value rises, I spend more because I know the price will likely go down. When the price is low or stagnant I hold off on major purchases. If it reaches its maximum adoption percentage across the world then it will still be deflationary per person as the population grows. If 21 million people represent X% of all people in the world and each has 1 bitcoin, then if the population doubles and X% of the population still uses bitcoin then you would have 42 million people trying to get 21 million bitcoins. This creates more value per bitcoin. As I usually say, due to the divisibility of Bitcoin, 1 single bitcoin could be used for all the money of a single nation.

I signed up for my hosting service specifically because they took bitcoin as a payment. Now I have to send money to my Electrum wallet from my phone which I then send to BitPay. Last time I had to wait a day because I sent enough for the payment then BitPay charged a 1% transaction fee so I had to wait for the price to go up so the transaction went through (instead of sending a few bits just to cover a tiny fee).
They also advertise BCH by showing BTC with X fees and BCH with 0 fees. Bitch, it's you that's charging the fees...

"American Telephone and Telegraph" had a government granted monopoly until 1890 when their patent ran out and competition started flooding in. At one point there were over 600 telephone companies in Ohio alone.
After many lawsuits against AT&amp;T for attacks on their competitors AT&amp;T finally got their supporters into power in DC and turned it all around with the Communications Act of 1934 that ended the newly forming wireless telephone technology and installed AT&amp;T as the national carrier with the Bell phone company as the local carriers (both from the same company). They were able to push this through with the excuse of "poor people outside the cities need telephone technology, and telephone service is too critical to the economy to not be controlled centrally". For 50 years telephone technology essentially froze to a standstill (dial up telephones) until the initial break up of the monopoly in 1984 and further in 1994.
We could have actually had wireless cell phones in the 1950s if not for this government created monopoly.

Horrible advice. "long term gains are lower than short term (still paying taxes)", "keep records", "get tax advice...here's my card".
Here is what you can do to TRULY minimize your Bitcoin tax liability:
1. Hodl until you can retire on just your Bitcoin money.
2. Become a minimalist (sell your house, all of your stuff, etc. until you can live out of a suitcase).
3. Travel the world, live in 2nd world countries where your bitcoin goes a long way. 
4. Only spend $35k per year from your bitcoin stash. This equals no taxes.

Good luck to you. You could always explain Bitcoin and soften it by doing what you can to paint a picture of what an alt coin would look like to fit within the Keynesian model. Freicoin attempted something like that I believe. And by your question of "wtf is Freicoin" is the answer to how many people adopted that shitpile. You could explore the concept of valuable currencies vs currencies that are not seen as valuable when it comes to spending practices and velocity of money. Many people prefer to hold bitcoins precisely because they have more confidence in its long term value while they are more than happy to let inferior fiat fly from their pockets because they do not value it as much. There are some examples of this with some different currencies such as Kurdish/Iraqi currency after the war and commodities vs fiat.

OTC is not some magical place where tons of money can be exchanged without affecting the price.
It's just like someone buying or selling on localbitcoins in person with cash. The person with the cash likely then deposits it and goes to the exchange to buy bitcoins with it. It's just a delayed or slowed impact.
You still need demand on both sides for the OTC transaction to take place. I have sold my house and bought OTC with a large amount of cash. I bought from one of the major payment processor companies. Had we both just gone to the market we would need to buy/sell with small amounts at a time to not move the market so much. As it was...we canceled each other out without any affect on the market price. Had we both gone onto the exchange and bought/sold it would just be in small increments canceling each other out in the exact same way.

Look at computers. If I buy a brand new computer with all of the latest technology I might pay $2-3k for it. If I wait a year, I can buy that exact same computer probably for $1k. Why are people not hoarding their money and waiting for the cheaper computers? Because people want "things" now. As someone who lives 100% off of bitcoin I still need to buy things. I still pay for stuff. I do admit that having bitcoins dis-incentivizes me from spending my money on useless crap making wiser spending decisions with my money. So yes, at a macroeconomic level we might start to see a slowdown in the economy and not such a huge consumer based economy. But what is wrong with that? People buying smart instead of buying the latest $100 margarita mixer for that occasional margarita they make at home that ends up sitting in the kitchen cabinet for 5 years taking up space.

They merely need to "assist" bitcoin by helping users with their own government wallets that do all the hard stuff for them ("don't worry, we'll keep your keys protected for you"). They'll keep track of your bitcoins in their system and create an easy pay for you at all of the stores (Thanks government!). Verify the amount of BTC the government has? Why would you want to do that? You're unpatriotic! Then slowly but surely they decide that their payment system does not need to be fully backed by bitcoin and they sever the ties between Bitcoin and the payment network.

Any p2p exchange where you send money to someone's bank account or receive money you need to be aware that some transfer types are reversible. I had this happen with a SEPA transfer. I sent the bitcoins after verifying that I received the funds. Then a few days later my bank said the person's bank account was hacked and they were reversing the transaction.

I have used OTC for a large trade. I think the key is that you're not moving the price up while you buy that large amount. So in theory you're getting it below spot because if you bought the same amount on the exchange the price would be higher by the time you finished trading.

Yes, I live mainly on bitcoin. I buy most everything online with bitcoins. When I need cash I use localbitcoins. I currently live in Korea and exchange for Won every few months to have spending money for things like restaurants and food. I was paying my rent through a bitcoin bank wiring service but they discontinued that. I will probably use my localbitcoins guy to send the wire transfer for me. The Won has been higher than the USD on the exchanges so my exchange rate is usually close to 1:1.
In Germany I convinced my landlord to accept bitcoins for rent and I was able to buy food online with bitcoins as well as buy German grocery store gift cards with bitcoins. I reached 100% bitcoin spending there. The language barrier in Korea keeps me from that here.

Each transaction has an address and a number. I assume it would just be a code change to any node to accept more than 8 decimal places.

What is traded on the exchanges is not the full market cap of bitcoin, some estimates put the amount of money traded on exchanges at 1/50 of all bitcoin. That would mean about $3.5 billion worth of bitcoins on the exchanges determine the price. There are $2.5 billion worth of tethers. If those tethers become worthless, they pull 70% of the value from the trading economy.
Not necessarily a threat to BTC, it would just create a huge dip in price. Though this threat may be already factored in by now since it is well known.

Ignoring the naysayers, here is how it could be done: Just like with the changeover to the Euro, or any other country changing currencies the government would just say "on this day we will start accepting bitcoin as well as our former currency, 2 years from that date we will no longer accept our old currency for any government payments".
Then they would set up a public exchange with 0% transaction fees. They would then start phasing in their payments for all of their employees and purchases from their old currency to bitcoins at X% per month (5% bitcoin,95% fiat in month 1. 60% bitcoin, 40% fiat after a year, etc). They would likely have to subsidize some sort of bitcoin readers for all merchants and hold workshops and education efforts (commercials, pamphlets, help desks, etc) to help people learn how to use Bitcoin. After the 2 years they stop printing their old currency and no longer deal in fiat. Everyone is now their own bank and can collectively enjoy a currency that doesn't purposefully lose value over time.

I am anti-inflation and pro bitcoin spending. I get paid in bitcoin and spend bitcoins. When I am not spending, the value of my money goes up.
Yes, the US economy is very consumerism based. Is that really a good thing? Buying plastic Chinese shit or some other materialistic bullshit so that you can display to your neighbors how successful you are.
I've always been rather minimalistic in my living so having bitcoin as my main currency fits very well. If it were to take over the economy people would spend their money initially on what they -need- first, and occasionally on what they "want". Sure, the lambo market might go away and the food, water, basic lifestyle support will boom and make it easier for the poor to get ahead. 
The idea of having a 3000sqft house might become a strange concept due to not needing room to store all of your shit. Maybe people would enjoy their tiny home, enjoy traveling more, have more fulfilled lives,  spend less time killing themselves at work so they can live paycheck to paycheck as they rack up huge amounts of debt, becoming slaves to the banks and creditors, never being able to get ahead.
Or they can be like me, "retiring" at 44 to go work on what makes me happy.

As someone who has lived on bitcoin (at least 95% percent of the way) I will say that you are better off using bitcoin for your basic needs than using fiat if you're smart.
I would use BitWage for my salary which I received every 2 weeks 100% in bitcoin. On that Friday I would note the price when I was paid. If the price went up during the 2 weeks until the next paycheck I would spend the money on things like groceries, bills, etc. If the price went up several percent I would buy things that I'd been putting off (Amazon purchases, vacations, etc.).
If the price dropped the whole two weeks (rare) I would just buy anything that was needed the Friday I got paid. But usually at some point in those 2 weeks the price was up a bit so overall I had more spending power than people using fiat.
Now I am retired so I don't have the regular income but I still use bitcoin for almost everything.

They also artificially set their fees high so that they can show you that it's cheaper to send bcash every time you use them.

Poorer in what way? Does owning the latest wrist gadget make you rich? Does a "hoverboard" make you rich? Do you need 2-3 cars and a 3,000 sqft house?
I think not needing to ever worry about money is more fulfilling than owning a Lamborghini. If that is what you consider being "poorer" then you are stuck in a trap that even Bitcoin cannot save you from.
I could buy several Lambos but I am content with buying a used Hyundai for $2k. My family thinks I'm crazy and tells me I need to start "buying things" with my Bitcoin money (everything I own fits in a suitcase). I would rather retire in Tahiti.
I am essentially saying that it is a good thing if people get richer (bitcoin-wise) because they do not waste their money on unnecessary things. When you have more money at the end of the month than what you started with (not including your income) you are richer.
Most people in the US end the month with less than they started (more debt), or they "succeed" and break even.

I think the best approach for all businesses is to just use companies to sell gift cards. That way they don't have to worry about payment processors or what currency/etc. they need to accept. Just a simple system for the business for all customers. Then many many third party systems can interact with that system.
The only thing needed for Walmart to "accept bitcoins" in the same way that people believe should happen is for someone to create a simple app that does everything in the background and you hand your phone with the bar code to the cashier.
I have lived on Bitcoin for several years. It is actually quite easy to use a site like Gyft or eGifter as your BTC wallet and pay at one of the hundreds of merchants they have gift cards for.
At Walmart I just open my Gyft app, select the amount for the card, then it gives me a card on the screen with a barcode. I then hand my phone to the cashier when I pay and she scans the bar code. 
The only step that would be different if they accepted bitcoin is the part where I specify the amount for the card.

Do you truly want to use bitcoin to buy at these places or do you just want the price to go up because of it?
For example, are you currently using bitcoin to buy things at Walmart? If no, why not?
If it's because you have to go through the "oh so difficult" step of buying a Walmart gift card before you check out...then you really don't want to spend your bitcoin at those places. You just want the price to go up.
Alter the way you spend first. Then these places might start accepting it.

Checking through my browser history I went back about 3 weeks and found that when doing a google search on "bitcointalk animated gif" I was directed to a bitcointalk.to site that is a phishing site. They steal your password from there.
If you google anything bitcointalk related about 95% of the results are that bitcointalk.to site.
The only way to get your account back is if you had a Bitcoin address associated with that account. Then you can sign a message with that address to prove it was your account.

The IRS has advised to choose up front if you want to do First In First Out (FIFO) or Last In First Out (LIFO). If you choose FIFO you would take the amount you bought BTC for initially and compare it to the price you paid the first time you sold it (which "I have traded some" means you sold). LIFO might work out as well.

I pulled most of my money off of MtGox when they stopped accepting Dwolla transfers. When they stopped USD withdrawals altogether people started converting their dollars to bitcoins (which was part of the reason for the run-up in price). I was able to convert mine and get my bitcoins off of the site even though it was at a higher price than most other exchanges. Everyone on the forums was warning about MtGox and not being able to get your money out. If you're keeping your money on an exchange that everyone is saying will not give you your money, you are just gambling at that point. And the few people that had their money on there readily admitted that they were just on there taking advantage of the huge swings/higher risk/higher reward. Everyone knows if you don't hold your keys you don't own your coins.
Fortunately now there are many more exchanges and the bitcoin/fiat world is not as centralized as it used to be. The more options the better. No single point of failure and more people can get their fiat converted to bitcoins.
You sat on bitcointalk while the price dropped to $150 discouraging people from buying. You sit here at a low price of $650 discouraging people from buying.

Anything of value sustains that level only by demand. 
Same as the dollar or any fiat currency (again, currency that purposefully loses value over time). If everyone starts using bitcoins tomorrow, why would anyone speculate with the dollar? 
Your ponzi insanity is just that. Insane. Bitcoin, diamonds, gold, silver, dollars, sex, drugs, rock and roll, all have a price due to supply and demand.
Some people actually see value in a currency that is the most decentralized and secure in the world that allows you to transfer wealth across the world for bits, that can not be confiscated, that is not used to perpetuate war and poverty, that can be moved in large quantities across borders, is useful all over the world and is purposefully created to gain value over time as the population grows and the supply stays low.

For me, I am almost at 100% bitcoin. I have some spending fiat for some local stuff but it's mainly been in bitcoin for the past several years.
Why do I spend bitcoins? Because to spend fiat that means I have to have fiat in the first place. By spending bitcoins it means that I don't have to reserve X amount of money every month for fiat. Or spend bitcoins and immediately buy bitcoins with fiat (that would mean you were sitting there with inflationary fiat that could have been bitcoins).

No. The capital gains are taxed differently but your income plus gains determines how much you are taxed on those gains. Over $418k(ish) and you have to pay 20% for capital gains. 
However, if you are in the 10 to 15% bracket (which includes income plus capital gains) then you do not pay tax on capital gains. For 2017 the 15% bracket topped out at $37,950.

I highly doubt that. MtGox was impossible to use by October. The only people that still had money on there knew that the exchange was on its way out, the only reason to keep your bitcoins on there was for heavy swings in price. They stopped allowing fiat withdrawals in October 2013.
Most problems with bitcoin come in when dealing with fiat. Best thing to do is avoid fiat currencies (currency that purposefully loses value over time) and stick with just Bitcoin. Only use the exchange to convert your money.

I agree. Consider what happens during the eventual market or USD collapse.

Ok, so the next time Facebook drops 25% in an hour or the other stocks drop due to the fact that they're built on a house of cards these big firms will want to buy the dip...or even out their portfolio. There they are sitting on a shitload of bitcoins...why not sell those to prop up those other failed investments?

Roads are the lowest libertarian priority because we have gas taxes which are the closest thing we have for "pay for use" when it comes to forms of taxation (the closer to pay for use the better, why should you have to subsidize someone else's driving?).
Fire services? I used to live in a county where the fire department, ambulance service, garbage service, electricity, water company were all private. Good customer service and reasonable prices (Fire service was $2,000 for full house fire which was paid by the insurance company, $50-$100 for small kitchen/yard/whatever fires, or you could pay $20 per month for full coverage).

Never heard of Venmo. The key to them receiving bitcoins is that it changes their thought of "Bitcoin is some numbers somewhere that don't exist?" to "I have bitcoins right here on my phone". When they hear any news or see the price they approach it as a Bitcoin holder. 
I told my family that they needed to buy bitcoins back when they were $18/BTC. They dismissed it. It wasn't until I sent my sister a $5 bitcoin tip via e-mail for her birthday earlier this year she bought a whole bitcoin at $250. She said she ended up spending (not selling) a half bitcoin when the price was $500 and the price kept going up.
I sent my buddy $1 worth of bitcoins after having him download breadwallet last week and when he came to work Monday he said he bought a whole bitcoin. He owns $100ks worth of Apple stock and I had been telling him about Bitcoin for months, it wasn't until he saw such a simple sample of how it worked that he got it. Now he watches the Bitcoin price as much as he watches Apple.

I did read the law when it first came out.
"Luis Núñez: There is no specific legislation banning Bitcoin."
Despite what sensationalist articles like to proclaim. No nation has actually banned Bitcoin. I read the law of every claim of a ban and it is usually a central bank with no legal jurisdiction warning against it or saying they will not allow it in their banks. In some countries the central bank has some legal sway on financial policy and they declare that they will not use it. But no country has any law against having, using, mining bitcoins.

If you're withdrawing USD from an exchange you have a record on that exchange. You either transferred your USD to the exchange or exchanged BTC for the USD on that exchange.

Craig Wright's friend, Dave Kleiman, who Wright claims helped him "invent bitcoin" died soon after the message from satoshi to Gavin was sent.
My guess is that Kleiman was Satoshi, creating it knowing he wanted to leave something behind when he left this world as opposed to anyone else who would have tried to make some money off of it. He likely talked with Wright about it, and did get some advice. The fact that Wright knew that his friend could never refute his claim, he was safe in proclaiming that he was Satoshi and tries to capitalize on it.

Good older video about the fundamentals of Bitcoin. Not much new on money laundering other than explaining what it is and how it relates to Bitcoin. Money Laundering is just another way for governments to control the people with the most tyrannical governments having the most strict money laundering laws (can't move X amount of fiat without reporting, can't take money out of the country, rules on what you can spend your money on, etc.). It destroys a currency's fungibility making some of the currency more valuable than other of the same currency. It should have no place in the Bitcoin world. It is a tool of weak law enforcement that cannot deal with crimes without making everyone (including innocent people) jump through hoops because they can't do their job.

My system was not a one person one vote system. More like a crowdfunding site using bitcoins to vote for funding projects.
What it basically does is gives everyone a public key for being in favor of the proposal (or several keys for non-yes/no questions). It creates a list of those public keys and password encrypts the list, making the encrypted file publicly accessible. During voting phase everyone that supports the proposal sends bitcoins to the public key given to them. In my scenario there is a funding goal, if it reaches the goal the proposer keeps the bitcoins, otherwise the money goes back to the individuals.
Once the vote is finished the password for the encrypted file is released, and the list is released (verifiable by anyone that wants to decrypt the original). The list of public keys shows on the blockchain the results of the vote.
I have since discontinued the project (BitPools) due to lack of interest.

People in poor countries use Amazon's Mechanical Turk to do stupid little things like fill out surveys or click on links for money.
They get Amazon dollars and if they want to turn those Amazon dollars into real money in their own country it takes about 6 months for that to happen.
Some people would rather not wait 6 months and are willing to get a smaller amount in exchange for money today.
So they use purse.io to buy things on Amazon with their Amazon dollars.

If the project is "should we fund a new Internet backbone from the US to Africa" and you decrypt the project to see "Comcast, Comcast, Comcast..." and the project gets funded. Then no problem. The list also would reveal the "from" addresses so there could be some dividend sharing process or whichever to those addresses anonymously. Each "vote" was a minimum amount of bitcoins to go toward funding the project.
It is similar to an ICO and DAO I suppose. I started the project back in 2013 so it was a bit before its time. And the main flaw was that it was centralized (I could decrypt it at any time to see the results early, or see who voted which way). My hope was to create a simple interface so people got used to the concept before working on decentralized methods of doing the same thing.

Use itBit for large purchases. Then put those bitcoins in cold storage. Then work on contributing to Bitcoin in whatever area of expertise you have. Pull that cold storage out in a few years and start spending your bitcoins.
Never use them to buy government currencies.
Don't worry about the current price. When the price was $235 I had a buy order in for $225 with about $25,000. Needless to say, the price never returned to my $225 bid and I finally dropped that money in later (I think around $600). Best to not try to play the market unless you're some Wall Street technical analysis wizard. Just buy at the current price.
When I sold my house the price was hovering around $660 jumping up and down. I just bought as much as I could (I could only wire $25k per day). I bought at whatever the price was as soon as I could. Averaged around $650. A week later the price dropped to the high $500s. I know...sad story right?

Yes, that is what I do now due to the difficulty of searching the South Korea Internet to get a good feel for spending bitcoins locally. In Germany I was able to do it with a slight understanding of German but I doubt I will be in this country very long so I do not plan on learning the language.
But using localbitcoins and cash does allow me to not use a bank which charges insane conversion rates. I got rid of my debit card years ago. It only presented a problem once when I was crossing the Cambodian border and the border patrol asked for the local currency or dollars for the entry fee (I was not aware of the fee). I only had some euros on me. They told me to go to the ATM, I told them I don't do ATMs. Fortunately the border control agent let me use euros. Surprisingly not gouging me.

The kicking in 6 months from then is more of a gentlemen's agreement than anything hard coded. Hopefully with SegWit and LN it is obvious that it is not necessary.

No, it's not security at the network layer, it's security at the application layer. Even a basic Bitcoin transaction is secured at the application layer with no way of manipulating it at any of the OSI levels to change the makeup of the transaction. Otherwise the transaction just becomes corrupted and is not accepted.

Having lived in Germany their issue is not race but the huge amount of problems that the refugees are bringing with them (terrorism, so much raping, attacks on school girls for not covering up, etc). One of the big complaints is the amount of government aid being given to the refugees. More than is given to German citizens. I'm pro-open borders but the quick influx has caused a lot of problems.

Bitcoin's weakness when it comes to governments is the act of getting bitcoins using the old system.
So it would be like people trying to drive to their local teleporter being harassed on the roads with roadblocks all along the way checking IDs and asking where you are going, where are you coming from, etc.
Once we all have teleporters we won't have to worry about that, until then...we are still screwed when dealing with the old system.

I am just reading this nodding my head at just about every response since I am almost entirely living on bitcoin. I have not taken that last step of using billpayforcoins to pay my mortgage since they charge 3%. I am considering using brawker.com to pay it but I'm not sure if someone can send a check through that site (and I have the house rented so it is basically being paid already).
I would likely be at 100% bitcoin like you but I live in Germany. I get paid in dollars (which I use bitwage to convert 100% to bitcoins) and live in a world of the euro.
I pay for most things with bitcoins. You mention cheapair for hotels but I would recommend expedia since they give you points. I do use cheapair for my plane tickets though. Unfortunately renting a car is not available yet.
I ordered an Anx debit card which I will be able to fill with bitcoins so that will also help.
I use an Esso card for gas but the only way I can fill it is to link it to a bank account so that doesn't work. But I spend maybe $10 a week on gas.
Here in Germany rolling the money through localbitcoins is a bit more profitable at 10% minus .3% for the exchange, and there is a high demand so I tend to have a lot of cash on hand (I don't feel comfortable depositing more than 5000 euro in my bank each week) which I use for food and going out.
I've started using brawker more and am pleased that I can buy almost anything online with it. I also use purse.io for my Amazon purchases.
I plan on being 100% bitcoin by the end of 2015. It is not as easy in Europe (especially with the language barrier) but as long as I can spend bitcoin for anything online that should take care of most things.
I too like the idea of being able to pick up and move any time. I have downsized all of my possessions to a backpack and carry on (plus my 2 dogs). I only rent month to month (usually finding a place through AirBnB and I pay my landlord in cash).
It's good to see someone else with the same mindset. No matter what happens with Bitcoin, as long as the services that exist right now do not go away...it is a success. And almost every week something pops up to make it even easier.

I have created a system for secure voting on the blockchain. The problem in elections with one person one vote is tying one person to their private key. It could be done, give each person a "paper wallet" at the polling booth where they use it and can verify later their votes on the blockchain. 
There would need to be mechanisms in place to ensure that one key goes to one person, that they do not sell their key to someone else, that someone does not buy someone's vote by using their key to verify it on the blockchain, etc.

Don't let people on here get you down, as you can tell from the guy's last bitcoin transaction there are not many people that use Bitcoin in the real world. Keep it up though. I try to use Bitcoin in the real world as much as possible and it is often met by similar such situations. Only the owner knows how that works, the tablet under the counter isn't charged, or I usually just get "it's broken" from the waitress that doesn't want to deal with it. Sometimes I'm the one training the person on how to accept bitcoins. 
It's all good though, we're all pioneers. Expect some difficulty in the first stages.
I figure eventually most businesses will be accepting bitcoins without even knowing it via their card reader.
I also used to use Coinbase's wallet. That was about the only time I've had a long wait. Maybe it's the whole routing your transaction through the NSA's network before sending.

In theory, if ownership was easily transferable you could actually transfer ownership on a daily/hourly basis via Bitcoin's blockchain.

If there were a consensus of what the price will do in the future, the current price would already reflect that.

I think the lesson to be learned from tulips is that they went away and nobody buys them anymore.

Federal Reserve Act of 1913 declares a state monopoly on US currency. You just have to point out where Bitcoin was made illegal.

Here are a few articles that give very informed knowledge of the likelihood that Bitcoin will die.

But why not spend that depreciating money on an appreciating currency?

I have crossed several national borders with my cryptosteel wallet containing letters and numbers that, if put in the right order, contain my private keys. I suppose I would have to declare the amount that was on the cryptosteel. I could even give it to them and say "now you have all of my bitcoins" and walk off. Then go move my coins from my backup.
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:47:21
BitCoin, Bit Coin. These are great indicators of people who don't get it that are trying to sound smart.
@_date: 2016-07-19 14:26:35
Why would you spend any money if you could instead buy an appreciating currency?
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:54:59
I doubt there is. I believe they are the site where companies like BitPay go to sell their merchant's bitcoins for dollars. You will get a personal representative and will buy in lots of around $50-$100k.

I used them to get my full paycheck converted to bitcoins for a year. Once it is set up there is nothing to do but receive bitcoins.
I was usually concerned when they constantly rolled out new Bitcoin ideas like buying gold and many other side projects while they should be focused on their very unique service of paychecks to bitcoins.

I am sure at some point in time you had $91.91 that you did not buy bitcoins with. At least with that transaction you were contributing to the Bitcoin economy.

I don't think so. I only see bits. On second thought, I have tried twice today to send bitcoins by clicking a link with all of the information. The window pops up asking for my PIN. It accepts the PIN then closes the window (without executing the order). Same with scanning a QR code. Most likely something specific to my phone as it has worked before on my other phone.
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:32:50
No idea what that means.

I have paid rent in bitcoin in the past and currently use a service to send bitcoins to a wire transfer service to pay my rent.

The whole tulip article adds nothing. Do you know how many times this has come up regarding Bitcoin in the past? Like any time an economist looks at a bitcoin chart and doesn't like seeing people getting rich. So they write an article about some tulip porn they heard about in college.
Or they claim that bitcoin is dead.

If you have money to pay for things with fiat...then you're missing out on the opportunity that you could have had if you had converted that fiat to bitcoin.  
Convert it all to bitcoin. Pay for things as necessary.

I am not sure, the only time I needed support was in their early days and they were quite helpful. They never hold your bitcoins so the only problem would be if your paycheck went through and you don't get your coins.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:32:13
"Or they claim".
Was Bitcoin a great money when it was less volatile than the pound last year? When it was more stable than Brazil's currency for several months? Is the currency of Venezuela not great money because it is more volatile than bitcoin?
Bitcoin has healthy growth every once in a while between very stable periods that get even more stable year after year. Most claims of volatility went away a long time ago. Way to bring back a blast from the past.

Get some euros in Italy via localbitcoins before you get to Germany. It is hard to convert bitcoins in Germany. And localbitcoins is blocked there. Hit up coinmap.com. takeaway.com might work in Italy and Amsterdam as well (not in Germany).

The whole "smart contract" thing in Ethereum is just hype so that people buy their premined coin. Might these contracts work in some distant future? Maybe. Who really cares if the ETH holders are making money.

The best way to tell if it is in a bubble is if the price doubles in 2 weeks.

Most likely a case by case basis. That's why Purse.io charges fees. To handle these cases.
Reputation, history, etc. will likely play a big role. I had someone say that they sent an item but it did not arrive. That person also did this to several other people so Purse refunded the money.

So you are saying a young currency is volatile compared to monies that have been around for decades?
The volatility trend over just the past 5 years shows the volatility decreasing year over year. It is widely understood that as the market cap grows to the levels of national currencies the volatility will level off.

The only reason anyone with bitcoins wants Amazon to accept it as a payment method is so that the price of bitcoin will go up. It has nothing to do with wanting to buy things on Amazon with bitcoin.
You can already buy things on Amazon in many different ways with bitcoin, all at a discount.

Banks send the price through the roof. Those holding bitcoins will not need to use as many bitcoins when they spend them. They can spend bitcoins for the rest of their lives and not run out of money.
