I couldn't agree more, but guess what, people do it because they feel important and they get some attention. It is a clever way to manipulate the masses. I hate it too. 
If there was a way to make people feel important by joining the bitcoin community, it could trigger a ripple effect of people buying BTC.

This would be beneficial to the propagation of bitcoin popularity but I don't think it would increase the price of BTC itself. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:00:23
Yes, but the ARS is not going back up, and that is for sure. BTC might.

I agree about not attacking the other currency, but it is curious to see how dogmatic most people are. It makes me think that as bitcoin becomes more accepted and adopted, it won't be necessary for people to understand how it works.

As many of you have pointed out, the space shuttle is no longer active and was never meant to fly to the moon. 
I hate to disappoint you all but this means that with my analysis, the current rally may not go to the moon after all. However, we might see some action in the low orbit unless it blows up.

I am sorry but I have not used it. According to their website it is the same price (about 14/1 ARS/USD). "Current buy price: $ 6776.73 x BTC"

uhm, sure.

Ya know... People doing the ALS challenge are dumping water on themselves AND donating money, so I'm pretty sure that if this catches on, people would probably do both also ;)

Okay, but generally speaking, non-fiat money is (or was) backed by gold/silver. Fiat money is the term given to currency when it is not backed by these metals.
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:04:15
I'm surprised too. 
It would be helpful for the bitcoin community to share both good and bad news, here in r/bitcoin. News like these should be at the top as soon as they come out.

You can exchange it for AR$ (arg peso) at a much better rate than the official bank US$-AR$ price.

I will take your advice. I think that *traditional* vs *digital* currency makes more sense. I agree that both are fiat.

Muy clara tu explicación. Coincido 100% con tu análisis. Soy argentino también pero vivo en San Francisco y quisiera empezar un negocio con bitcoin en Argentina. Si te interesa charlar un rato, avisame. Saludos.

There is still only one Bitcoin. Side chains, forks, new cryptos will continue to come up but there is always going to be only one. The best one will prevail in value but there is so much money in the world that at this stage it does not matter at all. The whole crypto market cap is just over 100 billion. "There is $1.2 quadrillion invested in derivatives alone".

Lamborghini was started by a disgruntled Ferrari employee. Regardless of branding, all bitcoin forks have "bitcoin" in their name. 
So far, nobody has given me a valid argument, on why the technology of bitcoin is superior to bcash (as I just learned, how I should call it in the subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:29:26


What do you mean? Who is everyone else?
Comments like that make me think of a "cult" mentality. Like doublespeak from 1984.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:46:12
I have been subscribed to this subreddit for years. I am disappointed, as any other old subscriber should be. I am seriously confused and alarmed to see the negative press about bcash. I am happy to hold a free alcoin that now is worth $1200. I think all old BTC hodlers should be. If there is a reason I am not understanding, I thought of seeking advice in the right place.

The problem of scalability was solved before it occurred. Block size was always meant to be temporary. Holding on to the 1mb blocks is an obvious mistake that even  a five-year-old would have been able to solve, however, the interests that control the code of bitcoin today, decided to stick with 1 mb blocks, to force people into submission to their off-chain transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:20:14
I beg you to explain, I might be stubborn but I do want to know why is SegWit a better technology. I am not opposed to anything that the core devs have done, EXCEPT keeping the block size at 1 mb. That should raise a HUGE RED FLAG to anyone that understands the problem of scalability.  Why not doing the same with 10 mb blocks?  
The excuse of the small raspberry nodes is not acceptable.

You are right, the govt is the only one disrupting the economy. Unfortunately Bitcoin still has not had a significant impact in their economy, but this tweet goes to show how stupid the govt is. They just gave Bitcoin free advertisement.

Are you ready to hodl for 10 years?  Otherwise, you will end up selling all of it when it goes down and will end up with nothing. Because IT WILL GO DOWN before it goes up. That's how it has been and that is how it will be. 
Best of luck.
