When markets like this exist in every industry, there won't be enough undercover agents to bust it all. The whole economy is going to shift towards under-the-table transactions. And then the mega-state dies.

You get very cheap medicines because American consumers pay exorbitant bills that help subsidize the costs of researching those medicines. We pay for all the Research and Development and you get the cheap end product. If we didn't foot those bills on the front end, no one would have developed the drugs your country enjoys. 
You don't get "free" hospitals or universities, you pay taxes through the nose for them in an insanely inefficient system. Your country is crippled by debt and is going to be in even worse shape when the Catalonians declare independence and take all the money in Barcelona with them. 
Spain has crippling unemployment in their youth, and a ton of people are moving away from Spain because of the lack of opportunity. It's not exactly the model for the future. 
El Estado es la esclavitud , en encubrimiento. Los individuos que son propiedad de la colectividad. Y el sistema , al igual que todos los sistemas basados ​​en canibalismo , está condenado al colapso.

Moral of story: journalists have the story written and are simply looking for quotes that conform. 
Prepare, accordingly. 
Prepare bumper sticker slogans, 2 sentence summaries, and a paragraph long elevator speech on the subject, and don't say one damn thing more. Don't answer the questions they ask, answer the one they should've asked.

Well, if you understood why we fought the WAHW, you'd understand we were trying to keep out the banking interests from places like NEW YAWK who would incite wars, as European financial interests had, for profit. 
I'm glad you've seen the light and are now on team decentralization and freedom, [just like us.](

Do you think it would be better for BTC if we could use it at 7-11, or in an alleyway? 
This is just delusional thinking...if retailers can't accept BTC, they won't. And that's a big road block to people in the real world accepting BTC.

The premise of QE is that it's the solution to the problem of the Economic Crisis and Great Recession of &gt;5 years ago. The markets are under the impression that it worked and we're moving away from easy money policies. When they realize that there is no way to move away from these policies without economic collapse, they're going to freak out, en masse.

Currency moves are usually sustained for months or years. This move against the dollar started last summer. The dollar has broken negative trend lines that go back 30 years, and appears poised for a multi-year bullish run. This is at the same time the Euro has violated major support, going back to 2003. The technical stage is set for a very long bearish run in the Euro (and other world currencies) and a long bullish run in the dollar. 
There is $9 trillion in dollar-denominated debt in Emerging Markets. If the dollar continues its climb, a lot of those loans will default. 
If that happens, a financial crisis could ensue, sparking recession and forcing the Fed to debase the dollar, again, or risk crushing American GDP and exports with the strong dollar. 
That final wave of money-printing, which will likely be QE4, is what I think will break the Fed's credibility in the world marketplace. And that's when you see the dollar begin its hyperinflationary death spiral.

This is my concern. If they outlaw possession of bitcoin, it won't disappear, but using it in your everyday life will become much more difficult. The passion in his statement was unnerving to me. And enraging.

Life breeds hierarchy. Some organisms are more fit than others. As for anarchism: 
"Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions." - Wiki
Marxism seeks to destroy classes/hierarchies, not anarchism. Quit trying to rebrand. You're not fooling anyone.

Don't like laws? Think they're unjust? Move to Somalia. 
"This is a really sad day for this subreddit. The top comments are asinine opinions about the government not granting individuals their "rights." Ms. Parks sat in the front of the bus. She was found guilty. There is nothing here to defend. 
If you sit in a bus seat which you are legally prohibited from sitting in you are subject to the law of the land you live in. If that sucks then maybe try to ride the bus in another country like Somalia where it might be legal."

Look at campaign contributors. In many states, Anheiser Busch is one of the largest contributors to both parties. In past years, this was the case with the tobacco industry. It's so they can count on having votes in their back pocket. It's not an outright bribe, and sometimes it doesn't work (see Congress going against Big Tobacco after years of being their lackeys). But a lot of the time it works.

It's actually more likely to be less than 1.14 trillion than more. All the government intervention has driven bond yields so low that it's very likely no one will want to sell the ones they have locked in at a given yield. The ECB may have to monetize 100% of new treasuries to reach their 1.14t goal, and even that might not be enough.

If someone else can claim the product of my labor, how is that different from slavery? Civil and property rights are not two separate things, they flow from the same source: I own my body and my mind, and the things that my body and mind collaborate to produce. Civil rights and property rights are both simply recognition of the various manifestations of my self-ownership.
