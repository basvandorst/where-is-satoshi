He probably called the police as soon as this woman started asking about Bitcoin because he's had other crazy people harass him about it before.
That could also be why the cop that turned up knew what bitcoin was and the guy's name, if they had had call outs before.
Edit: Ok, I think the second point is a bit of a stretch, but I stand by the first point.

I originally bought in at around $500 and now that it came down again I've doubled up.
We're at the same place again but with no gox  and a wider user base! Feeling optimistic.

What about a bot that sends $5 to any user (outside of etc) that uses the word bitcoin in their post? (one time per username).




You're kind of describing Flattr:
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:45:19
Thanks for the heads up, all of you. It's beyond my abilities to get it to show up though... 
Edit: we can have a fun time transferring it on Christmas day and learning about security!
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:34:29
Theoretical spending! I'm not going to advise them to spend it and it's not worth it for a couple of quid!
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:05:19
I would also like to know this.
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:33:16
You're right on my meaning. So importing the private key is all that is required and you have full use of the wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:25:17
I just remembered this. I set up 6, then transferred £1 to them each. But I did one twice and missed one out! (The perils of doing this quickly whilst people out shipping!)
I had already wrapped them up, so I decided to use it as a demonstration and I'll send it when they open them up on Christmas. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 10:49:43
I feel really stupid that I'm contributing by buying at this rate instead of a month ago and watching the rise gleefully. I'm expecting a normalisation to come, but I'm just happy to be in on the ride now!

In terms of using the public section, you could only have it linking to one string, be it bitcoin key, Twitter handle, phone number, whatever. 
I'm thinking having it hooked up to a randomized plain text url with as many keys in it as I want, allowing people a choice at a fist bump. Am I missing a trick here?
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:12:44
Sorry, I should have phrased that better.
One if the major things my naysayer friends comment on is the 'crashes' and I point out that there aren't 0-value crashes in bitcoins history.
But I know that doesn't mean it CAN'T happen
@_date: 2013-12-23 13:31:21
I keep talking to them about it and they are ranging amounts of interested so i put £1 each into a paper wallet. Let's see if they get interested!
Edit: I got them real presents too...
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:21:36
I always try to correct the term 'crash' to normalisation, as it always returns to this trend and very rarely 'crashes' below where it was before the rush.
Looking at it now, I would usually predict a 'normalisation event' over the next couple of weeks but given all the media hype around BTC at the moment, I'm honestly optimistic that we might avoid a big drop. But if it does I'm upping for the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:47:51
I made 6 paper wallets for each of my family and put £1 in each. If they got interested cool, if not, no worries.
Edit: like this 
(I put a blocker over the private key after learning from the other day)
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:23:35
The point I use this to make is that it never 'crashes' in the way people imagine (i.e losing all their money). It just falls back to the general growth trend that has been steady for the last few years.
@_date: 2013-06-05 18:13:47
Because it's practically impossible to get bitcoins in the UK otherwise. (without massive processing fees).
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:27:12
She actually seems excited. I can't explain it. I thought she wouldn't care but I can hear her and my Dad discussing it and how it would work!
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:20:37
Nb. It's not "a bitcoin", it's 0.0025 BTC
@_date: 2013-06-05 18:18:19
Wait, that's how much you pay from a supermarket?? I would expect 100 teabags for that amount! (Here in the UK)
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:21:07
Noob question here:
You generated a private key, but this keyring is a public key (noobish assuming). How do you generate a public from a private, and did you hand over the private to your dad too, in a "keep this safe until you need it" kind of way?
I'm planning on doing similar for my parents for christmas with a couple of mBTC (only on laminated cardboard!) and trying to get my head around it.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:48:47
I did this on coinbase.com. you print a 'wallet' which has a public and private key on it, then fold along the line to hide the private key.  You can then transfer as much as you want into it.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:46:04
Or you could always wait until you get home from work...
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:27:33
You can only buy using coinbase in three USA, but I prefer it for storage and the app. I buy my coins elsewhere and send them into coinbase
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:32:35
Holy crap, I didn't fix the resolution on that... RES saves the day again.
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:35:04
Has it? This was the first I've heard of it and it came out yesterday!
Not doubting, but do you have a source?
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:37:26
Thank you, this is exactly what I was looking for.
EDIT:Hmmmm, maybe not. the link keeps dying saying page not found if I try to generate.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:46:40
That's incredibly nice of you, loving the Christmas spirit around here!

I started reading a lot about btc about a year ago and was in the "hey, that's cool but it's for other people" camp for quite a while. 
Then when it came into the news around April last year at the spike I thought "I should really get in on this". I missed the window (luckily) when it peaked and then normalised, and again I said "I should get in on this" when it was back around $100. But I didn't. I couldn't pay by card or online in the UK and the SEPA thing scared me, so I let it go.
Now, with the increase on the go again I sucked it up and bought my first bitcoins (£100)  at about $400. I feel really stupid that I could have x4 the money right now, but it's my own fault and now I'm just happy to be on the train! Now to find some wild bitcoin accepters to buy stuff from!
EDIT: Didn't close my quotes and it was driving me mad.
