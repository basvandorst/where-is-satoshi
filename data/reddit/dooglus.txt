All addresses are known, but not all public keys are known. Addresses are 160-bit hashes of public keys.
Satoshi's coins were all mined to public keys, not to addresses, and so will make great targets for theft by quantum computers.

Both. It is plain stupid but I hear there was almost meant to be some limit in place such that BitGo would only automatically sign transactions worth up to a certain amount without requiring further action from Finex. I've no idea why that protection didn't work in this case, or why they didn't simply hold the majority of customer deposits in a cold wallet.

Consider also that the thieves gained access to the exchange 3 days ago but didn't steal any coins until today. It would have been in their interest to short BTC and wait a few days before stealing anything:
1) they profit from the short when the theft is discovered and the price collapses
2) the short causes the price to drop and brings more coins onto the exchange as people panic sell - that's more coins on site for the hacker to steal

Electrum is incompatible with every other wallet as far as its seed word backup goes.
I know this doesn't help you now, but in future I would suggest using a wallet that is compatible with BIP39 so that you aren't solely dependent on Electrum continuing to exist (and Electrum servers continuing to be run).
I hadn't heard before that Electrum is now even incompatible with older versions of itself. That's pretty bad.

It's a fork, but not a hard-fork.
Although it becomes a hard-fork as soon as someone hard-codes a block hash into the client. Two factions arise, one wanting the bailout reorg, the other wanting the original chain. They both hard-code the hash of the block which starts their side of the reorg into their client. Exchanges list both sides of the fork, and we have the ETH/ETC mess all over again.
Let's hope not!

@_date: 2016-08-16 19:26:52


That's quite a misleading description. When you make a transaction you aren't sending keys. You are moving treasure from a bunch of chests to another bunch of chests.
Think of Bitcoin as a series of treasure chests. Each chest has a slot in the top like a piggy bank through which you can deposit treasure but to take treasure out of a chest you need the key to unlock it. When you send Bitcoins to someone, you're using your keys to unlock some of your chests, taking out the treasure, depositing some of the treasure into the recipient's chest through the slot in the top, and putting the rest (or "the change") into a chest of your own (again, through the slot in the top). Your Bitcoin wallet is simply a collection of chest keys.
The chests are all in a single massive room (called "the blockchain") and never move. All that ever changes is the amount in each chest.
It's also worth noting that the keys are just big numbers, like treasure chest keys are just bumpy pieces of metal. If you can guess the right number you get the treasure - just like if you guess the right shaped bumps for a treasure chest key you could make your own copy of the key to steal the loot.

@_date: 2016-08-02 16:16:53
That's a trickier case. It could be argued that ETC is really just a new name for ETH, and what is now called ETH is a new coin with new properties (non-tamper-resistant, censorship friendly). Hard forks are messy and cause this kind of problem. Where do you draw the line?
Suppose tomorrow a minority BTC mining pool decides to hard-fork Bitcoin. They get 10% of the hash rate, and offer a 100MB blocksize limit. Most people reject the new fork, but replay attacks are everywhere, and Coinbase (ignoring the silly new unsupported fork) "give away" everyone's BTC-BIG or whatever it's called. Are they liable for it? What if there are 100 different tiny hard forks. Are Coinbase liable for tracking every lunatic's individual hard fork to make sure they don't accidentally "give it away"?

So there are 3 keys. One is safely offline in cold storage, but only 2 are needed to spend funds?
Presumably Finex have one key (per user) and BitGo have another? How do BitGo decide which transactions to sign with their key? I doubt they'll be phoning Finex for every transaction. Is it automated? And if so, how is this better than Finex having a regular "1 of 1" private key?
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:39:42
I'd like the description to also cover the fact that if you find a key you automatically know which chest it unlocks (ie. you can derive the address from a private key), and "finding" a key is as simple as making up a big number.
So there's this room full of chests. Each chest is labelled with a Bitcoin address. The chests are in order, so it's easy to find the one labelled with any particular address.
At the door there's a big bucket full of keys, one per chest. They're all mixed up in a random order, but each key has a Bitcoin address stamped on it. When you want to open a Bitcoin account, you reach into the bucket and pull out a random key. You find the corresponding chest, and put your treasure in it. You make a copy of the key for later and put the key back into the bucket. You don't want to, because that seems like a crazy idea. But there's a security guard and he won't let you leave with the original key. Then you stir the keys up good and hope nobody finds your key again.
I think that's a pretty good description of how Bitcoin's security works. It's a very big bucket with a lot of keys in it. You hope nobody ever picks the same key as you did. There are people picking random keys over and over trying to find one that opens a chest containing some treasure. But there are so many keys and so many chests that they never find one with anything. Over 99.9999999% of the chests are empty.

@_date: 2016-08-08 14:29:49


Yes. They have some BTC left that wasn't stolen.
To simplify the numbers:
Suppose 100k BTC was stolen, and that the 'haircut' is 40%.
You are saying that the BTC holders need to be given 60% of the stolen 100k BTC back and so Finex need to buy 60k BTC on the open market.
But suppose that before the hack Finex were holding 200k BTC and 50k BTC worth of other stuff. Then the stolen 100k would represent 40% of their total holdings. The thief only took half of the BTC, and so even before buying any more BTC, Finex already have enough that I have 50% of my coins. So they only need to buy the extra 10%. That is, they "only" need to buy 20k BTC on the open market.
We don't have good numbers to work with, but this should work as an example to show that since Finex are already holding a significant number of BTC they don't need to buy 64% of the stolen 119k BTC on the market.
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:39:23
My math works out very similarly:
    36% of total assets was 119754 BTC
    so total assets were 119754 / 36 * 100 = 332650 BTC
    subtracting the known BTC assets gives:
    332650 - 91853 - 33388 - 119700 = 87,709 BTC * 600 = $52,625,400 worth of non-BTC assets

I disagree. They regularly double people's holdings of the "coin", but their quoted value per coin only ever increases. There is no market and so no price discovery. The price is entirely made up by the scammers. They limit how many coins you are allowed to sell. They claim to have millions of users, but not a single merchant accepts the coin. This all points at it being a scam.

Giving the private key to the user allows the user to steal any coins in the corresponding BTC address. The point you are missing here is that "your" deposit address isn't really yours. The private key is in the Coinbase wallet, and belongs to Coinbase. You have no right to know it, and have no claim on any of the coins in that address. When you send coins to that address you are giving them to Coinbase in exchange for what is effectively an IOU: an entry in their internal database of user balances.

Some feedback:
* I'd like buttons to double and halve my current bet size
* Taking 'commission' from each win feels bad. I won 2x on a 0.00200 bet and got 0.00196 profit. How about just making the winning zones 1% smaller?
* 2% seems too high. Competing sites typically have a 1% edge.
* Is the game provably fair? If not, why not?
* When my bet is in progress, the bet amount reads `0.002`. As the bet ends it gets changed to `0.00200`. If I'm editing it while it gets changed things get confusing.
* After winning a little I tried withdrawing. I couldn't choose the amount; it withdrew it all. I selected the text of the popup message with a view to copy/pasting it, but the click-and-drag I did to select it seems to have dismissed the popup. The withdrawal hit the network quickly, with a decent fee.

Suppose your statement is true and consider the Ethereum situation:
Did a hard fork happen? Was it "decided" (whatever that means)? Was there consent from the community?
I would suggest that it did happen, but without consensus being reached, and that this was in fact possible, contradicting the initial supposition.
Therefore your statement is false. Proof by contradiction. (Or maybe by misunderstanding what it is you're trying to say).

"This market resolves to the amount of Bitcoins that were stolen from Bitfinex users"
The Bitcoins were stolen from Bitfinex, not from their users. You should clarify that. Finex may pass on the loss to their users or they may be able to cover the loss themselves. But as of right now, the theft was from Finex.
Edit: also your ranges seem a little low. "Over 5000" is the highest. I would suggest adding "over 10k", "over 50k" and "over 100k" too.

Back-of-envelope calculation:
It looks to me like they were doing about 125k BTC per week on average just on the BTC/USD market. I don't know what their fee was like, but let's say 0.2% on both sides. That means they were taking 500 BTC per week in fees. That's 25k per year, so it takes a little under 5 years to make the 120k that was stolen.
Maybe the fee was low for market makers or big customers, and maybe the volume would be a lot lower after the inevitable loss of confidence in the exchange from a theft like this. So 5 years is likely a low estimate.

Can I read more about that somewhere? I would be interested to read about how using bitgo is safer than keeping say 90% of user funds offline, safe from theft.
Presumably you have full access to the bitgo wallets, because you need to be able to take BTC from one user and give it to another when a trade is done. At first glance this would appear less safe than keeping most coins offline.

The coins which are in your address are unspent outputs of previous transactions. They aren't inputs of any transactions yet. If they were, they wouldn't be in your address since they would already have been spent.
When you spend your unspent outputs they become inputs for the new transaction.

If you continue using your existing wallet, you will not be using HD address generation. You'll continue having to refresh your backups every 100 addresses.
If you want to take advantage of HD address generation you will need to make a new wallet and transfer your balance over. New wallets created with v0.13 will be HD unless you explicitly ask for them not to be.
Note that you need to backup your new HD wallet *after* encrypting it, since encrypting it changes the HD seed.

That's right. I myself made a hard-fork last night that transfers all coins to an address that I have sole control of.

Your account was drained, and you only used clef to authenticate.
How does that have any impact on whether they also cracked my password?
I don't see the two things as being connected.
It is quite possible that they gained access to the Finex servers through an API bug, and used that to access the database. Once they had database access they have all the usernames and hashed passwords, can brute force them at their leisure, and use them to attempt to steal from Kraken accounts.
The fact that you only use clef doesn't thwart this plan in the slightest. Do you see? If you didn't have a password it would stop them cracking *your* password. But it wouldn't stop them cracking mine.

Currently if Alice wants to obscure the linkage between herself and the recipient of her payment (Bob), she deposits some coins to a third party with a large shared wallet, like BitStamp, and then asks BitStamp to send some coins to Bob. The deposited coins won't be connected to the withdrawn coins on the blockchain but blockchain analysis can show that Alice deposited to BitStamp and that Bob received his payment from BitStamp. Pressure could then be applied to BitStamp and they would be able to reveal that Alice was responsible for requesting the payment to Bob. Another problem is that BitStamp may "get hacked" or otherwise lose custody of Alice's coins before the payment to Bob is made.
It appears that TumbleBit solves two of these problems:
* TumbleBit doesn't know the linkage between Alice and Bob, and so apply pressure to them doesn't achieve anything
* TumbleBit doesn't have custody of Alice's coins, and so cannot lose them.
It is still visible that Alice's payment went to the TumbleBit shared wallet, and that Bob's payment was made from that same shared wallet.
So what we have here is a centralized mixing service (like BitFog and all the others, not like JoinMarket which is p2p) but without the two biggest problems: the mixing service doesn't know who sent what where, and the mixing service can't lose or steal the coins.

You know what? If you didn't already use your passphrase anywhere "online", then you're probably still OK.
Just make sure you never do type that passphrase on a connected machine. Each time you want to spend from one of your wallets, decrypt it on an offline machine (the same way you originally encrypted it) and load the unencrypted private key into your online wallet. Then it doesn't matter that they all have the same passphrase, because nobody but you knows it.

Using a 12 word seed is good enough so long as the attacker doesn't know the 12 words.
When you restore a seed on Trezor, you have to type the words into a possibly compromised computer, but in a random order.
So the attacker ends up knowing the words, but in a random order.
There are only around half a billion ways of ordering 12 words, whereas there are around half a septillion ways of ordering 24 words (about a quadrillion times more than for 12 words), making a 24 word seed safe *even if you type it into a compromised machine* (in a random order).
Note that they could have achieved the same result by sticking with 12 word seeds and simply asking you to type 12 random words in addition to your 12 seed words when restoring, and this is apparently how the Trezor restore process used to work.

"Signature operation".
Verifying an ECDSA signature is computationally expensive. So the client attempts to limit the number of signature verifications per transaction. Previously there was a hard limit on the number, and this change appears to make them more expensive (tx fee wise), rather than simply illegal.

@_date: 2016-08-22 18:41:04


Nearly. How it actually works is each word provides 11 bits (it's chosen from a dictionary of 2^11 = 2048 words), so each group of 3 words provides 33 bits of which 32 bits make up the security and 1 bit is the checksum.
So a 12 word seed is 4 groups of 3 words, so 4*32 = 128 bits of security and 4 bits of checksum.
A 24 word seed is 8 groups of 3 words, so 8*32 = 256 bits of security and 8 bits of checksum.
This is why you never see seeds which are anything other than a multiple of 3 words long.
Edit: it may be a bit surprising to hear that a 12 word seed only has 4 bits of checksum. That means that you have a 1 in 16 chance of picking a wrong word and not having the error detected. To see if this is really the case I had a wallet make up a random 12 word seed:
    canoe glide erosion remember candy pride attack tobacco real adapt cup easy
then tried replacing the last word `easy` with all 2048 of the words in the dictionary, to see how many of them were considered correct according to the checksum. I found that 128 of them were considered correct. That's 2048 divided by 16. Here's the list - you can replace `easy` with any of these words and the 12 word seed will still be valid (although it will no longer generate the same addresses):
    absent advance again also annual argue art aunt awkward bamboo beef black blue borrow bubble bus
    cactus carpet census chef chuckle client coach cool core crisp crunch danger decorate deposit devote dinosaur
    divorce dry easy elevator endorse enough evil exhaust fabric fatigue field fit flag fog frog fury
    gift glare goat guilt hand height hollow humble illness income insect ivory junior kiss ladder lend
    lens load luggage margin maximum mesh metal monitor motor name nest nothing october olive oval palm
    peace pelican pink police possible profit protect puzzle quote ready release retire rib ritual runway sausage
    scorpion sense share shuffle sing slim smoke song spend spray sting stone suit surprise tackle teach
    they tissue top track truck twenty unhappy urban van verify volume warrior way wild wool young
There will always be 128 ways of replacing the last word of a 12 word seed phrase, since the checksum is at the end of the phrase (part of the 12th word). Replacing the other words will give you numbers around 128, but usually not exactly 128. For the example 12 word phrase above there are the following numbers of ways of validly replacing each word, respectively:
    127 135 120 137 114 126 111 121 131 145 133 128
Edit2: doing the same analysis for a random 24 word seed phrase:
    question desk horn swift embark code juice law scheme coconut kite gaze shrimp evoke slush beauty slide paddle three pact swear away jelly broccoli
The last word can always be replaced 8 different ways:
    broccoli cliff drip into lounge save solution urge
And the other words can be replaced in 8-ish ways. In this example the counts are:
    14 10 10 15 6 13 7 12 10 6 12 8 7 8 5 11 9 10 8 9 8 7 9 8

The App accessing that information means that the company has access whenever they want it. The current version may not send the information to the company, but the next version could do.
One thing I do know is that if the app doesn't request certain information then it can't send that information to the company. Those are the apps I use.


Why not make those "ease of use" things optional? Request the permissions the first time they are accessed, and if denied then fail back to a basic service. I don't need my wallet to know my identify or location. Having it know those two things doesn't make a wallet easier to use for me. Why would it? As it turns out it actually makes the wallet much harder (impossible) to use for me, because I refuse to install it while it is requesting information I am unwilling to give it.

In the case of Bitfinex the regulators effectively said "hey, you can't keep all your coins in a cold wallet; you need to keep each user's coins in a separate wallet and regularly update the per-user balances or you aren't doing proper "delivery" of coins.
As a result they stopped using a cold wallet and put all the coins online instead. Without the "help" of regulators this theft couldn't have happened.

Sorry if I'm being dumb, but what exactly *is* the problem with him using his own exchange to trade? Is he party to some information that the rest of the world doesn't have? What kind of unfair advantage does he get from his "insider" position? If the full orderbook is public (as it appears to be) then I don't see the problem, morally speaking. I understand it may be against regulations, but that's not what I'm asking about here.
I guess he can see who is behind each order in the book. Is that the problem?
Edit: I continued reading the thread and see that you already answered my question:


I can see that. If he can see exactly what kind of a price movement is required to force a big liquidation then he could certainly profit from taking advantage of that information. As for "front running", is that where he sees someone place a big order that would match existing orders and quickly undercuts the best existing order such that he gets the trade? That would of course be wrong to do too.
Would you have a problem with him using his own exchange to invest in Bitcoin long-term if you could be sure he wasn't front-running or deliberately forcing people to be margin called?

I tried this yesterday. I found no option for specifying a message along with the subscription. My name did appear on-screen, and the guy did stop the game he was playing to celebrate his new subscriber. So it works...
As for donations, twitch has recently added "cheering", where you type "cheer N &lt;message&gt;" into the chat and it tips the streamer N "bits" and associates the message with the tip. Bits are nothing to do with Bitcoins. I think Twitch themselves keep quite a large percentage of each tip - like 50% maybe?
Before "cheering", streamers would use "twitchalerts", which is a third-party site that allows viewers to tip streamers using PayPal. Twitch receive 0% of each of those tips, which is presumably why they implemented their "cheering" alternative. I'm not clear whether it is possible to buy these "bits" using Bitcoin or not, and don't intend to find out while the fee is around 50%.

If you know the 24 words but not the correct order then it would take the whole Bitcoin network 1 or 2 years to brute force the correct order. So if the wallet contains less than a year or 2's worth of mining rewards you would be better off mining than trying to crack the Trezor wallet. 200 BTC is less than a day's worth of mining rewards, and so not worth cracking.

They shouldn't, but I understand people thinking they should. When a third party service like Coinbase gives a user a deposit address, the user starts thinking of it as "theirs" - they send coins to it and the coins show up in the user balance after all. But the address belongs to Coinbase, as does its private key. Coinbase are under no obligation to share the private key with anyone. Indeed if the user had the private key for their own deposit address they could "undeposit" coins as soon as their balance was credited.
If you want to know your private keys, make your own wallets. Don't ask a third party to do it for you.

From my point of view all of your justifications for why you need so much personal information from me are unnecessary services.

I don't want your wallet to suggest names for the people I send coins to. I would rather not share my contact list.

No, the attack is like this:
* You want to buy something from a site.
* The site sends you an amount and an address to pay.
* Your PC is infected. The malware changes the address to one of its own.
* Your PC displays the attacker's address, and sends it to the Trezor.
* The Trezor displays the attacker's address, asks if it's right.
* You compare with the address on screen, and confirm.
* The Trezor signs a payment to the attacker, and you send it.
You have ended up paying the wrong person, because you have no way of knowing that the address you see on both screens is the wrong address.
To prevent this attack you need to have a reliable way of talking to the merchant site. "Payment Protocol" was intended to address this exploit since it uses certificates much like SSL does in an attempt to defeat man-in-the-middle attacks, but I don't know if the Trezor knows about it.

I extended the search to also include 3 digit amounts. It was harder to filter out the non-Finex transactions since 3 digit transaction amounts are so much more common, but I think this is pretty close:
The new total is 84022.45583623 BTC.
I guess there are a whole lot more 2 digit amounts so I wouldn't be surprised if the 125k figure is accurate.

The Trezor could make this more secure by randomly asking the user to type specific random words in addition to the backed up words:
* type the 6th word
* type the 19th word
* type 'coffee'
* type the 1st word
* ...
That way the guy with the key logger sees 30 words, not 24, and doesn't even know which of those 30 words are really part of the backup.

Maybe the point is that you have to give a valid 2FA code before they will sign the transaction? I don't know. But for a busy site like Bitfinex they would have automated the 2FA stuff (or bypassed it using an API key, I guess) rendering the whole thing pointless.

In which units is that 500-1000? If you mean USD then that's around 2 BTC. People do trades of that size all the time.
Check out localbitcoins.com and see if there is anyone in your area buying bitcoins. If so, you can meet them in person and get your money immediately.
Asking whether an amount is "considered sizeable for bitcoin" makes little sense. Is $500 considered sizeable for diamonds or gold? I guess it depends on who it is doing the consideration.

What I don't understand about LN is how we size the payment channels we set up.
Suppose I was to deposit 1 BTC at PrimeDice, and attempt to win 10 BTC by making a 10% chance bet. And suppose PrimeDice is running a LN hub. How do we set up that payment channel?
We make a 2-of-2 address, I send 1 BTC to it, and they send 10 BTC to it? More often than not I'm going to lose my bet. They will have 10 BTC tied up in the payment channel we opened. They're likely not going to be willing to commit that 10 BTC to our payment channel just on the offchance that I win the bet.
So maybe we set up the channel by each sending 2 BTC to it. I use the channel to deposit my 1 BTC to them, and then I win my bet. They owe me 10 BTC, but how can they pay me? The channel maxes out when I withdraw 3 BTC I guess.
It seems we need to know in advance how much we will each be paying the other in the future so that we can know how big to make each side of the channel, because channel sizing can never be adjusted; it is fixed at creation time.
Another example: I regularly sell altcoins at an exchange and withdraw BTC. I very rarely deposit BTC to the exchange. Can I use LN in this case? It seems that since the channel is pretty much always going in the same direction (BTC moving from the exchange to me) it will end up all at my end after a while. To meet my needs the exchange would have to tie up a large number of BTC in a channel to me in advance. Whose BTC do they tie up like this? How do I convince them that it is worth their while doing so?
Is that a correct understanding of the situation? I guess I am missing something and would appreciate finding out what it is...

Margin trading allows me to minimize my counterparty risk. Suppose BTC is $500 right now and I think it's going to $600 soon. I have $5000.
Without the option of "playing on margin" I deposit the whole $5000, buy 10 BTC, wait for it to go to $600, and withdraw $6000. I've risked $5000 and gained $1000.
With the option of margin trading I deposit only $1000 and use it to borrow $5000. With that I buy 10 BTC, sell them later for $6000, pay off the loan leaving $2000 in my account (minus fees). I've gained $1000 as before (minus fees) without having to risk more than $1000.
If the exchange was robbed while I was waiting for the price to rise I would only lose $1000 if I was using margin instead of losing the whole $5000.
On the other hand the risk of losing the $1000 is higher, since if the price moves against me I quickly get margin called, but that's part of the risk assessment I have to make.


I don't *need* to borrow money. I simply find it more convenient and safer to borrow the money than to risk my own. The interest I pay is worth if to me for the counterparty risk I avoid. The lender is earning interest in exchange for risking their coins in the hands of the exchange. Seems like a fair deal to me.

I wonder if there's a chance that the old private key still exists somewhere on the storage of your phone.
If it's a significant amount of coins it would be worth turning off your phone until you can gain raw access to its storage and getting a dump of that storage.
I'm not expert, but I'm guessing this would require 'rooting' your phone. It may be more trouble than it is worth, depending on the amount of money involved. It also may turn out that your old keys are already lost forever.

If the creation of new coins halved unexpectedly, then sure, but everyone already knows it's going to happen and so the price rise is already at least partially priced in.

Oh, yes. Because Mycelium and CoPay both use BIP44 (`m/44'/0'/0'/0`) whereas Breadwallet uses `m/0'/0`.
I think Hive wallet uses the same as BreadWallet, so that would probably have worked for you too.
It's a real shame that the wallet authors didn't agree on a single system for their seed backups and HD key generation. There are almost as many schemes as there are wallets.
The forthcoming v0.13 release of Bitcoin Core has HD keys. It uses yet another derivation path (`m/0'/0'` with hardened per-address generation) that isn't used by any existing wallet.

@_date: 2016-08-26 03:27:04


I'm going to take a stab at correcting you where I think you've got things wrong. I hope that's useful.


This isn't really true. Mycelium connects to specific proprietary back-end servers. If it was SPV then it could use and Bitcoin node. Currently if Mycelium's back-end servers are down their app stops working.
I read that they are working on a new version which will be able to connect to any BitCore node. It still won't be "SPV" but it will be more flexible than the current setup.


Note that Mycelium and breadwallet both use 12 word seeds, but the seed from one won't work on the other because they use different HD derivation paths. Mycelium uses BIP44 `m/44'/0'/0'/0` and breadwallet uses just BIP32 `m/0'/0`.
 is a useful site for experimenting with BIP32/BIP39/BIP44 and has a lot of useful information. He recently added support for Bitcoin Core's HD wallet feature (which is different again and uses `m/0'/0'` with hardened addresses).


That's exactly wrong. You do need to worry about the Mycelium servers shutting down because your wallet won't work without them. If they do shut down, you can import your seed into another wallet that supports BIP44. Or you could use the site I linked above to calculate the xprv code for your wallet and import that into any BIP32 wallet that supports importing xprv codes.


No, Electrum uses a completely incompatible kind of seed phrase. Most wallets that give you 12 words are using BIP39, but Electrum isn't.


Probably a good idea to warn people about "change addresses". If you have 10 BTC on a paper wallet which you import into breadwallet and then spend just 1 BTC of it, what happens to the other 9 BTC? Most people would probably assume that it stays on the paper wallet, but I don't know if it does. Maybe it gets sent to a new change address. And even if it does get sent back to the paper wallet, that private key is no longer purely on paper, since loading it into breadwallet has risked compromising it.

I just experimented with this. Addresses 0 through 27 in my Mycelium wallet had received coins, and the rest hadn't. I generated address 40 and sent coins to it. That's a gap of 12 addresses (28 through 39).
The next time I started Mycelium, it showed the payment to address 40 without me having to hit refresh; it just appeared.
I guess Mycelium is following BIP40 which says that "If the software hits 20 unused addresses in a row, it expects there are no used addresses beyond this point and stops searching the address chain".
Edit: I notice that Mycelium is now displaying address 41 as the 'receiving address'. It has automatically skipped addresses 28 through 39. That probably makes sense; it is assuming that I must have already given out those addresses, else how did address 40 get funded.

When people say "The Federal Reserve" they are referring to the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States.
The Federal Reserve System's structure is composed of the Board of Governors, the Federal Open Market Committee, twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, numerous privately owned U.S. member banks, and various advisory councils.
So to say it is "a bank" is neither clear nor accurate.
But whatever. I just feel like your "what is Bitcoin" page is likely to lose people at that point. It feels a little like being accosted by a poorly informed conspiracy theorist. People either already know about the Federal Reserve System, in which case there's no need to go into details or they don't, in which case linking them to a clear accurate presentation about it would be helpful.

tl;dw: Bitcoin will be "proof-of-stake" once the Lightning Network launches, because you need a stake to participate in LN.
That's not true, however. Bitcoin will remain proof-of-work after LN launches.
You need a 'stake' to participate in LN, but the stake won't be used to make Bitcoin blocks. That will still be entirely proof-of-work.
LN is no more proof-of-stake than when I lend Bitcoins to somebody at interest. The interest I can earn is proportional to the amount of 'stake' I have to lend, but none of my activity affects how Bitcoin blocks are mined. And neither will LN.

I find this hard to believe. How can doubling the amount of transactions in the blockchain each 10 minutes reduce bandwidth requirements?

I believe so. Your browser might upload the form contents to a central server to sync with your other computers, so work on an offline machine.


I don't know, and wouldn't trust it. I modified the site to allow you to type a bunch of random junk instead of using the RNG:
  
Put "fred" in the first field and always get "speak lawn rich glimpse return group broccoli edit mango village open chicken leave ancient sunset" as the seed. Just type random junk in that first field (100 dice rolls, or whatever) to deterministically generate a properly random seed.
Edit: I looked to see what it uses for its source of randomness and found this:
    var data = crypto.getRandomValues(buffer);
    return self.toMnemonic(data);

I think the negative effect of doubling the bandwidth and storage requirements outweighs any positive effect on solo miners. I doubt anyone is solo mining any more.


Good point. I don't think that separating my unspent outputs into two disjoint groups which can't be spent together is a good idea.


So when the chain is like A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B3,
A3 refers back to A2 and B1, and
B3 refers back to B2 and A2?
so at that point miners can choose to work on A4 or B4, but if they find B4 first, they all have to switch to working on A4 (since B5 needs to refer to A4 which isn't yet known). Right?


I think on average it would be. But at any given moment it wouldn't be. It would depend where the best tx fees were to be found. But as you say, if one phase gets left behind, everyone has to help it catch up, because neither phase is allowed to get too far behind.

Why would we want to increase the number of blocks mined if we don't decrease the interval?
The only reason I can see for mining more blocks is to decrease the expected time taken to get a confirmation, but your proposal doesn't achieve that.
Also, why would you key on the output being spent and not the txid of the transaction being mined? If you use the txid to pick the 'phase' then I can spend outputs from both chains at the same time, removing an arbitrary and confusing restriction that is present in your scheme.
Edit: also, wouldn't miners be free to choose in real time which of the two phases to mine on? Wouldn't they all be incentivized to mine of whichever one has the biggest total transaction fees available to claim? I don't see how you prevent the miners from all just working on whichever phase currently has the biggest reward.

Neither Bitcoin nor gold are debt based at all. I don't think it's helpful to refer to fiat currencies as "government backed". They aren't backed by anything at all. When a currency is backed by something it means I can exchange it for that thing that backs it. When the dollar was backed by gold, I could exchange it for physical gold. These days it isn't backed by anything. I can't exchange it for some "full faith and credit", whatever that might be. Saying it is "backed by" the full faith and credit of the US government is really not saying anything.

Maybe the fraudster has paid a large mining pool to attempt to double-spend the transaction quietly. The $10k transaction is already in another block, so the mining pool attempts to mine a block at the same height. They are likely to fail, but if they do you will never find out about it. They are mining the double-spend without broadcasting it.
The pool will be mining at the 'wrong' block height, which means they're less likely to earn a block reward of 25 BTC (~$12k) so the fraudster would presumably have to bribe then a large amount of money to even try the attack.
Of course, he could just make two transactions (one paying you, one paying himself) and broadcast one to half the miners and the other to the other half, then hope that 1) the one to you confirms first (50% chance) and 2) blockchain.info fails to detect the double spend (maybe 10% chance). So you're probably right that it's not worth the risk for the scammer.

It's "Bitcoin" or "bitcoin". I'm not clear on which to use when, but it's never written as two words.


Not really. You can't sell the coins until after they are mined, really. And there's no spreadsheet. As a definition of cryptocurrency that's pretty confusing.


There's no encryption in the Bitcoin protocol. There are digital signatures and hashing, but nothing is encrypted. You should probably encrypt your wallet to keep your private keys private, but that's not required, or part of the protocol.


Mining is the process of hashing a bunch of data over and over again with slight changes until you get a result that is less than a certain target. It takes *all* the miners in the world around 10 minutes to mine each block on average. It's more the case of being lucky than being the "right" server.
Miners don't use graphics cards any more since the advert of application specific devices which can run the hashing algorithm much faster and much more economically than generic graphics cards.


Once you find a small enough hash you have mined a block. Currently blocks are worth 25 BTC each, but in a couple of months that will halve to 12.5 BTC. It will continue to halve every 4 years or so.


Or which you use to buy goods and services from the growing number of people and companies accepting Bitcoin as payment. I heard today that even dentists are starting to accept them! Or you could hold on to your bitcoins, in the hope that it will be more valuable in the future.

Similarly if the BCH chain has more proof of work it doesn't become the official Bitcoin chain because it doesn't follow the rules of the Bitcoin protocol (because a small percentage of its blocks are greater than the 1 MB limit).

You get to be able to tell valid Bitcoin transactions from invalid ones without having to trust a third party.
As a "total newb", when you receive a Bitcoin payment, you can't be sure the transaction is real. It could be that the coin you were sent doesn't exist, or has already been spent. You are trusting someone else's full node to check this for you, and you're trusting them to tell you the truth. When you run your own full node you have an up-to-date list of all the unspent transaction outputs, and so you can very quickly tell a valid transaction from an invalid one.
You're also helping the Bitcoin p2p network to stay alive. If nobody ran full nodes there would be no network.

 I was part way through reading the linked article when the page changed to something about ad blockers.
I was able to reload the page and copy/paste the text before it disappeared:
IN THE ONGOING tug-of-war between secrecy and transparency over government surveillance, the side of transparency may have scored a slight victory today when Reddit appeared to disclose that it had received a secret order seeking information about one or more of its users.
The company didn’t say outright that it had received an order; instead it appeared to imply this in something it didn’t say.
Today Reddit (in which Advance Publications, WIRED’s parent company, owns a stake) released its annual transparency report, which lists the number and types of government requests it received in 2015, both requests for user information and requests to take down content from its user forums. But conspicuously absent from that report is any mention of the number of national security requests it received.
In Reddit’s transparency report for 2014, it indicated in a section titled “national security requests” that it had received no National Security Letter during that year, or any order issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
“As of January 29, 2015, reddit has never received a National Security Letter, an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or any other classified request for user information.” The company also noted in the last sentence of that section, “If we ever receive such a request, we would seek to let the public know it existed.”
Now, in Reddit’s transparency report for 2015, that entire section is missing.
How NSLs Work
National security letters are written demands from the FBI that compel internet service providers, credit companies, financial institutions, and others to hand over confidential records about their customers, such as subscriber information, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, websites visited, and more. NSLs have been used since the 1980s, but the Patriot Act expanded the kinds of records that could be obtained with them. They do not require court approval, and, most importantly, they come with a built-in gag order that prevents the recipient from disclosing that they have received an order. This makes the government’s use of them ripe for abuse; and indeed DoJ inspector general reports have uncovered abuses of the FBI’s NSL authority.
The letters are one of the FBI’s most powerful tools; but there is little oversight of them and they are rarely discussed inside or outside Congress. The public has become aware of only a handful of some 300,000 NSLs handed out over the last decade, and those became public only after the recipients launched legal battles opposing them. Although recipients of an NSL can challenge them in court, few companies that received one have done so.
In the face of gag orders, many companies have devised a method, called a “warrant canary,” to notify the public that they’ve received an NSL or FISA Court order without actually stating so—they do this by including a statement in their annual transparency report that asserts they have not received any such order for that year. As long as that “canary” keeps singing, meaning that it keeps appearing in a company’s annual transparency report, the public can safely assume this to be true. But once the “canary” falls silent in a transparency report, it’s a sign that the government likely served the company with a national security order during the period since their last transparency report.
Although gag orders can prohibit the company from saying in the positive that they received an NSL, the government can’t force a company to lie, says Kurt Opsahl, deputy executive director and general counsel of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which the company would be doing if it continued to publish a statement in reports saying it hasn’t received an NSL when in fact it has received one. The concept of warrant canaries hasn’t been fully tested in court, however, and companies could find themselves in trouble if the government decided to challenge them. Reddit is the first company Opsahl is aware of that has “killed” its canary, if that indeed turns out to be the case. But he doesn’t think Reddit is on shaky ground if it did indeed tell the public, in killing its canary, that it received a national security letter.
“The question is whether the government could require you to continue to [state you haven’t received an NSL] when that’s not true,” he says. “I would certainly argue that they cannot compel someone to lie.”
As for whether the government could go after Reddit for violating the spirit of the law?
“You can’t get thrown in jail for violating the spirit of the law,” says Kevin Bankston, director of New America’s Open Technology Institute.
Companies Push Back—Or Try To
Reddit didn’t respond to WIRED’s request for comment. But in a discussion thread on the site today, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, who uses the Reddit handle “spez,” discussed the issue of the warrant canary and the difficulty of not being able to confirm or deny whether the company had received a national security letter.
“Even with the canaries, we’re treading a fine line,” he wrote. “The whole thing is icky, which is why we joined Twitter in pushing back. I’ve been advised not to say anything one way or the other.”
His reference to Twitter is about an amicus brief that Reddit filed earlier this month, along with several other tech companies, in support of Twitter.
In that case, Twitter is asking the government for permission to publish a transparency report disclosing the number of requests for data that it received from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court between July 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. “Twitter does not wish to reveal detail about any specific order that it may have received from the FISC during that time period, but rather seeks to publish the actual aggregate number of [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)] orders received,” the amicus brief states. Twitter also wants the freedom to report that “it received ‘zero’ FISA orders, or ‘zero’ of a specific kind of FISA order, for that period, if either of these circumstances is true.”
Twitter, and the signatories to the amicus brief, assert that the gag orders that come with national security orders violate the First Amendment “and to the extent the government relies on those provisions to prohibit Twitter indefinitely from publishing information about FISA orders it receives, those provisions are unconstitutional as applied.”
They’re not the only ones who think so.
In 2013, a California district court judge ruled that NSL gag orders are an unconstitutional impingement on free speech, after one recipient of an NSL challenged it. US District Judge Susan Illston found that although the government made a strong argument for prohibiting the recipients of NSLs from disclosing to the target of an investigation or the public the specific information being sought under an NSL, the government did not provide compelling argument that the mere fact of disclosing that an NSL was received harmed national security interests.
A blanket prohibition on disclosure, she found, was overly broad and “creates too large a danger that speech is being unnecessarily restricted.” Illston ordered the government to stop issuing NSLs across the board and also ordered the government to cease enforcing the gag provision in other cases where they may already have been issued. However, the government appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which vacated her ruling and sent the case back to the district court last year. The case is pending further proceedings.
In their amicus brief in the Twitter case, Reddit and its co-signers urged the court to find that service providers have a constitutional right to report data about national security requests.
“This question is crucial for all companies seeking to provide accurate, useful information to their users in the aftermath of momentous public disclosures about government surveillance that have undermined user trust in online services,” they wrote.
As the recent Apple-FBI case over the San Bernardino iPhone has shown, sunlight and transparency help produce a healthy and vigorous public debate about government surveillance activities that have long been in the dark.

Understood, thanks.
I'm still not seeing how Bob gets himself into the position of being able to make a return from participating in the mesh.
He currently has one channel open with an exchange. There's 1 BTC in the channel, and it's all at Bob's end. How does he open a 2nd channel? He can't use his 1 BTC from the Bob--exchange channel without first closing that channel. So how does he open a 2nd one? He could buy another 1 BTC from a different exchange and withdraw it to create a 2nd channel, but then that channel would also be all on the 'Bob' side, and so Bob would still be useless for routing, since both of his channels are already fully at the 'Bob' side.
Sorry if I'm being slow here. I guess I just don't get it.

Yes. It only becomes hard to reach consensus when you have multiple users.
There was no consensus to remove the blocksize limit. That's why we ended up with a new altcoin rather than an upgrade.

Could you expand on that please?
Let's say Bob bought 1 BTC from an exchange, and received it by having the exchange open a 1 BTC channel to him. The channel is already all at the Bob side of things, so he cannot receive any more value until he spends some.
How is Bob to receive any more value now without open a new channel? Suppose he wants to buy a 2nd bitcoin and withdraw it. Doesn't he need to open a new channel to do so? How does your proposed mesh topology affect that?
I'm having trouble imagining how Bob gets involved in a mesh network. He's new to Bitcoin, owns just 1 BTC that is in a channel with the exchange he bought it from. Now what? How does he put his 1 BTC to use in a mesh? I guess he's going to have to open a 2nd channel with somebody or he's just a dead-end on the mesh, right?

You make a transaction. To do that you have to put a signature into the transaction to prove you have the required private key.
You broadcast that transaction to the network and wait for miners to confirm it.
While you're waiting, I change the signature slightly in a way that doesn't invalidate it, like maybe putting a zero on the front of it or something. That changes the transaction ID. I broadcast the changed copy.
You're waiting for your transaction to confirm, but it's possible that my altered copy confirms first. If you're checking by txid you'll think your transaction hasn't confirmed and might end up sending a second transaction. But my modified version did confirm, so you have paid whoever you were trying to pay. But the txid is different than you expected.
SegWit fixed this problem by moving the signatures outside the part of the transaction which generates its txid.

Core is the original version. It has almost all the developers working on it, all the innovation and expertise and is supported by the overwhelming majority.
Classic is a rehash of Gavin and Mike's failed XT fork. It has very little in the way of developers and exists as a single feature fork. The single feature is a hard fork of the blockchain to raise the blocksize limit from 1MB to 2MB.

That sentence leads me to think you have a misunderstanding of how the encryption is protecting you.
The encryption is entirely client-side. There's no encryption on the network.
If someone has a copy of your wallet and your password, you can't change the password in their copy, only in your own copy. Changing the password doesn't change the private keys at all.
Without knowing what you think is going on, it's hard to know where you're going wrong.

I expect it's not too hard to find two addresses which differ only by a single character.
Edit: start with a valid 34 character address; take each of the last 33 characters in turn and try changing it to one of the other 57 characters; that gives you 33*57 = 1881 (mostly invalid) addresses which differ by only a single character
The checksum is 4 bytes. The chances that one of those 1881 addresses is also a valid address is 1 in 256^4 / 1881 = about 1 in 2 million.
So it's kind of hard, but nowhere near impossible.

He's always saying we are opposed to Bitcoin being used as a medium of exchange, which is obviously false. He says we want full blocks and high fees. That is also false.
What we primarily want is for Bitcoin to be permissionless and decentralized. That means that we want regular users to be able to run full nodes if they want to, to validate their own transactions.

If the grandchildren want to send 1 BTC to grandpa each month for a year, how do they do that?
Seems to me they need to set up a 12 BTC channel up front and adjust the refund transaction monthly. They need the 12 BTC up front to do that. What if they don't have it?
It's OK if grandpa is selling the BTC each month as he receives it - he can route it back through the grandchildren to the exchange and a 1 BTC channel would suffice. But you know what grandpa is like - he's going to want to hodl those BTC.

Buying stuff with BTC in most cases is pretty much the same as selling your BTC for USD and then spending the USD on the stuff.
The BTC ends up for sale on the exchanges either way. The only difference is that Valve get to see that people are using BTC, and Steam users get some exposure to Bitcoin in their payment screens.

The probability of this having happened by chance is close enough to zero that we may as well call it zero.
Until the coins at that address were spent we didn't know which public key had been used to create the address; it was possible that someone had used a different public key and arrived at the same address. This happens about 1 in 2^160 times that you generate a new address.
But now that the coins have been spent we can see that the spender used the same public key as the whitepaper generates. This happens less often: only about 1 in 2^256 times.
There is effectively no chance that a 1 in 2^256 chance occurrence has happened here. What has happened here is that someone has hashed the whitepaper and put the resulting hash into bitaddress.org's 'wallet details' tab to generate a private key. It's effectively a 'brain wallet', only instead of using a passphrase as the secret they used a famous document.

Fees are charged per weight unit, not per byte. Odd that a post about SegWit would make that mistake.
Remember how there's a 75% "discount" for witness bytes? That's what the "weight unit" stuff is about. Non-witness bytes count 4 times more than witness bytes for fee calculation.

I'm trying to understand how the revocation of old transactions happen.
We have a current channel state, and want to transition to a new state in which my counterparty is sending me more money.
We need to:
* revoke the old state
* create the new state
If I require the sender to show me his revocation first, I might never sign off on the new state, leaving him with nothing.
If I sign off on the new state before receiving his revocation, he might never show me his revocation, leaving me open to 'double spending' by him reverting back to the state before he paid me.
So do the two things happen atomically somehow?

Bitcoin addresses contain 160 bits of information. Bitcoin public keys are 256 bits, but any public key with the same 160 bit address as yours can spend your coins, so you only really have 160 bits of security if you are using the default P2PKH (pay to public key hash) outputs.


That only gives you 101 bits of entropy. You should be flipping the coin at least 160 times.


    &gt;&gt;&gt; 160 / math.log(6, 2)
    61.89644915752665
If you roll it 62 times you will have over 160 bits of entropy.


Each roll of a 16 sided die gives you 4 bits of entropy. You need 160 bits, so roll it 40 times. You were talking about using a pair of them, so you would only need to roll the pair 20 times but be careful not to always write the lower of the two numbers first from each pair or you lose another ~1 bit per pair so 20 pairs only gives you 140 bits.
I like the idea of physically shuffling a deck of 52 playing cards, writing down the cards "5d6cJhAs..." and sha256 hashing the resulting string. The 52 factorial combinations of 52 cards in a well shuffled deck gives you 225.5 bits of entropy, which is plenty. It seems like less trouble than flipping 160 coins, rolling 62 dice, trying to find hex dice, or trusting Python's "random" module.


I don't like the idea of trusting a pseudo-random number generator. Just shuffle a pack of cards for half and hour while watching TV or something, then spend 2 minutes typing the card order into an offline machine to generate your randomness.
Depending on your level of paranoia you might want to re-shuffle the cards after you've used them; or maybe you want to keep them somewhere safe as an obscure backup for your private key.

But if all the nodes were running on AWS then that gives us a single point of failure. 1000 nodes all running on AWS doesn't give us much extra protection against attack than just having a single AWS node.

From 5:40 to 6:40 we're told that we want to avoid channel exhaustion because a cheating counterparty who currently has no money in the channel could attempt to broadcast a transaction from previous state where they did have money in the channel.
I can see that, but isn't it always the case after money has moved on a channel that the sender could attempt to broadcast a transaction from the previous state, and in doing so reverse the last payment?
How is the "exhausted channel" case any different? Is it really black and white, that "exhausted channel" is bad, but "almost exhausted channel" is OK? Why? What's special about exhausted channels that makes them so dangerous?

First off, the story sounds suspicious, because as far as I know the Bitcoin client has never generated 600 GB of data in 4 days.
Maybe he's mis-remembering, and it downloaded 600 MB of blockchain data. The blockchain reached 600 MB in September of 2011 so that would fit.
Either way, by then it was pretty hard to solo-mine a block. People had started using mining pools by then, and it sounds like your Dad likely didn't get that far. So he either got lucky and mined a whole 50 BTC, or he mined nothing. I'm guessing the latter.
Search the hard drive for a file called "wallet.dat". If the 600 MB was a big deal maybe he deleted the whole bitcoin folder, taking the wallet with it.
Edit: were 1 TB drives even available for laptops in 2011?

I'll try...


Connect to the airport wireless Internet.


VPN is Virtual Private Network. It's a way of disguising your IP address from the Bitcoin peers you connect to. Not really necessary if you're only going to have that IP address for 5 minutes between flights, but not a bad habit to get into.
Tor is "The onion router". It's another way of disguising your IP address. See previous paragraph. Seems unnecessary when your IP address is so temporary.


Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin wallet. Rather than syncing the hundreds of gigabytes of Bitcoin blockchain it connects to one of several centralized Electrum servers which it trusts to accurately report the balances of the addresses you own.


His Electrum wallet apparently didn't already have the private key for his 1andreas address in it. I guess the private key was only in his phone hot wallet, but he either didn't want to trust the phone wallet with such a large transaction or wanted more control over coin selection, fees, etc. than the phone wallet was capable of providing. Or both.


Apparently the large donations were sent with relatively low fees, and so hadn't yet confirmed. If you spend the unconfirmed transaction by making a new transaction with a very high fee attached to it, miners will rush to confirm it in order to claim the very high fee for themselves. But they cannot confirm any transaction which has unconfirmed inputs, and so in order to claim the high fee they also have to confirm the low-fee donation transaction. CPFP isn't a feature of Bitcoin specifically - you won't see it in the protocol anywhere. It's just a natural result of how transactions can't be confirmed until their inputs are confirmed.


I'm not sure about this. I guess he had previously tried moving the donation to cold storage without specifying a big fee to encourage the miners to confirm the donation transaction, and so decided to double-spend his first low-fee attempt at moving the donation with a high-fee version.


He received hundreds of donations to the same address. You might think that all the coins sent to a single address would automatically merge into a single large lump of coin which you can then move easily, but that's not how it works. If you receive 100 separate donations to an address you end up with those 100 separate donated amounts in separate unspent outputs. When you come to spend from that address, you (or your wallet) have to decide which of the 100 unspent outputs to use to fund the transaction. He wanted to make sure he was including any unconfirmed outputs in his transaction to force the miners to confirm them before they could claim his high fee.
Looking at the transaction he ended up making to cold storage I think he included way too many small inputs, some of which were worth less than the amount they added to the transaction fee. If it were me I would have only included the biggest unconfirmed ones with such a high fee, and moved the rest later when I was more calm, had more time, and when the mempool was less congested.


Cold storage is an offline wallet, where the private key has never been exposed to an online machine. This makes you a lot safer against attempts to steal your coins. It's much harder to hack a machine if it isn't on the Internet.


Bitcoin addresses have two components: the private key (used to spend from an address) and the public key (used to deposit to an address). Andreas travels with an unused cold storage public key, which lets him deposit to his cold storage wallet, but doesn't let him withdraw from it. The private key is somewhere safe in an offline machine or on a piece of paper locked away somewhere. Once he sends the coins to the cold wallet he himself has no access to them until he can get access to the corresponding private key, which he presumably doesn't have at the airport.


There's a fixed amount of space in each block. There is more demand for space in blocks than is available, so the miners have to decide which of the transactions waiting to get into a block to confirm. Since they get to keep the transaction fees that each transaction is offering, they tend to pick whichever transactions are offering the highest fee-per-byte, since this maximizes their income. Andreas chose to pay 200 satoshis per byte, even though that is way more than 99% of pending transactions were paying. He didn't need to, but he wanted to be super sure than the transaction would get confirmed as soon as possible. At this point the huge donation transaction hadn't yet been confirmed. He didn't know who had sent it, and there was a very real possibility that he was being trolled. The donator could at any time have double-spent the donation to an address of his own and paid a much bigger fee, effectively undoing the donation. By opting to pay a massive transaction fee Andreas was protecting himself against being trolled like that.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:10:52


The net gain is that real transactions need to compete with the miner's transactions to get into blocks. When the miner is filling the blocks with 100 sat/B transactions, "real users" have to pay 101 sat/B or more to get into his blocks. If all miners do the same, then "real users" all have to pay 101 sat/B or more to get into any block.
After a while users will get used to high fees, the miners can let up on the spam a bit and users will continue competing with each other at high fee rates.

No. I'm not saying anything about the number of valid Bitcoin implementations. I'm saying that Bitcoin Cash was an incompatible hard fork of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core has made a long series of compatible soft forks. These are different things.
If today you were running a Bitcoin client that you had downloaded a year ago, it would be following the Bitcoin chain. It would reject Bitcoin Cash blocks because they are invalid according to the rules that the year-old client understands. On the other hand, it would accept regular Bitcoin blocks, whether they were "SegWit" blocks or not. That's not because "Blockstream Monopoly AXA OMG". The client doesn't care about any of that conspiracy nonsense. It's because Bitcoin hasn't hard forked, and Bitcoin Cash has.

He created and signed the transaction on his own laptop, then broadcast it using public wifi in clear text. That happens with every transaction you make. The Bitcoin p2p network isn't encrypted - it's a bunch of nodes all passing plain text transaction messages to each other.
If someone intercepted his transaction on the way to the airport wifi hub and modified it, it would become an invalid transaction. Nothing much to worry about. I've made some very big transactions on public motel wifi connections in the past and not worried at all about the connection I was using. I worried that I had somehow messed up the destination address, double and triple checking everything, but I wasn't concerned about the wifi being public.

Here's a rough outline of how revocation works in LN:
The "old transaction" is actually a pair of transactions. One for Alice, and one for Bob. Alice has a transaction that was signed by Bob. She can sign and broadcast it at any time, but if it isn't the current state, Bob can claim both outputs from it.
Let's consider the old transaction (T1A) that Alice has. It has two outputs, both for 1 BTC in this case. The first output is pretty simple: Bob can spend it any time using just his private key. The second output is more complex: Alice can spend it after a timeout, and Bob can spend if it he knows a secret number (S1) that hashes to a particular value that Alice made up (H1)
When Alice wants to pay Bob the 0.5 BTC, they make a new pair of transactions with 2 outputs each. Alice's new transaction (T2A) will have a 1.5 BTC output which Bob can spend using just his private key, and a 0.5 BTC output which Alice can spend after a timeout, and Bob can spend if he knows a new secret number (S2) that hashes to a new particular value that Alice made up (H2). As part of transitioning from the old state to the new state, Alice tells Bob the first secret number (S1), so that if she ever tries cheating by broadcasting that first transaction, Bob can spend both outputs. He can always spend the first output (because it's his fair share) but now he can spend the 2nd output too because he knows S1.
So before Bob will create T2A for Alice, he insists that Alice provides him with S1 which allows him to claim both outputs from T1A if she ever signs and broadcasts it.

Signing an unsigned transaction requires nothing but the unsigned transaction and the private key.
Bitcoin Core has an RPC call: `signrawtransaction` which will use its private keys to sign an unsigned transaction.
Creating the unsigned transaction requires access to the blockchain to find out which outputs are available to spent, and transmitting the transaction once it is signed requires Internet access. But the signing step itself requires neither.

I don't care what it's called. It forked before SegWit activated, which makes the statement that SegWit's activation triggered a hard fork patently false.
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:04:15


This is factually inaccurate.
SegWit activated at block 481824 (Aug 23, 2017 6:57:37 PM).
Bitcoin Cash was forked from Bitcoin over 3000 blocks before that, at block 478559 (Aug 1, 2017 6:23:00 AM).
The Bitcoin Cash hard fork was caused by the Bitcoin Cash miners increasing the blocksize limit from 1 MB to 8 MB. As soon as they mined a block that was bigger than 1 MB in size, the Bitcoin miners rejected it, and the Bitcoin Cash miners went off on their own hard fork.
SegWit itself was implemented as a soft fork, precisely to prevent a chain split. Bitcoin nodes from before SegWit was implemented are still running, and are tracking the exact same blockchain as the Bitcoin nodes which have SegWit implemented. Only nodes which went out of their way to be incompatible with Bitcoin by relaxing the blocksize limit or other rules are on a separate chain. That includes Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, and other similar altcoin forks of Bitcoin.

If you're making a lot of payments and they're taking a long time to confirm, you're eventually going to end up with nothing in your wallet other than unconfirmed change outputs. So to keep making payments you're going to have to start spending that unconfirmed change before it confirms.
That's fine, so long as the txid of the payments you've made stay the same. But the new payments you make mention those txids specifically. So if the txid of the old payments change, the new payments become invalid.
There are two ways those txids could change:
1) if less than 100% of the inputs to a transaction are segwit utxos, any third party can malleate the transaction, changing its txid, and invalidating all child transactions descending from it
2) even if you use segwit for all your deposit addresses, you may find that you need to bump the fee on some old unconfirmed transactions if there's a sudden unexpected increase in the fee required to confirm; that again will change the txid of those transactions and break the chain of payments.
So if you're a big company with more customers than you can handle, it's probably a good idea to use very high fees, pass those fees on to your customers, and in doing so kill two birds with one stone: less unconfirmed outgoing payments, and less pesky customers.

I don't understand your point. Are you saying that if two transactions pay the same fee per byte then mine won't get confirmed but the other one will?
Nobody's "letting" anyone else go first. The highest fee transactions get confirmed before the lower fee transactions. It's a fee market.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:05:49


How did you calculate that?
32 million bytes at 1 satoshi per byte would cost 32 million satoshis, or 0.32 BCH.
At the current price of $2522 per BCH, that works out as just $807 to fill a 32 Mb block.
But the current blocksize limit is just 8 Mb, which would be 4 times cheaper at 0.08 BCH or $201 to fill.

In terms of lightning, it's [like this](


The fee is simply the difference between what he pays for the dog, and what he charges the guy behind him for it.
For example, say the hot dog costs $10, and that each person along the chain charges a $0.02 fee for passing the hot dog along. There are 5 people in the chain. The guy at the front pays $10, but gets $10.02 from the guy behind him. His incentive to pass the dog back is that he gets to make a 2 cent profit on the deal. He gets paid $10.04 by the guy behind him, and so on. All the other guys also have a 2 cent incentive to pass the dog back. The customer ends up paying $10.10 or so, paying a 10 cent fee to avoid having to fight his way through the crowd.
Some of the guys might offer to do the passing of the dog for free. Maybe they just want to see the hot dog distribution network gain popularity. Or maybe he used to charge 2 cents per hot-dog pass, but the guy to his left started offering the service for 1 cent, and so he undercut him by charging 0 just to spite him. We don't know why he's charging 0, but we don't complain. Maybe he just likes to give the dog a little squeeze as he passes it on (and sell information about which direction all the dogs are going to the highest bidder).
All the fees end up being paid by the actual customer.

The setting defaults to "p2sh-segwit" I think, and that's more likely to be accepted as a valid address for now - so maybe it's best not to use bech32 receiving addresses yet. Maybe just specify the change address type to be bech32:

It's unfortunate but we don't seem to have a standard which is easy to back up (like BIP39's seed words) and offers secure encryption (like BIP38). It seems like you have to pick one or the other.

* until now, the GUI would never generate SegWit addresses
* if you wanted a SegWit address, you had to use the `addwitnessaddress` RPC
* addresses generated using `addwitnessaddress` wouldn't be recovered from the HD wallet seed - you would have to manually re-run `addwitnessaddress` to get your coins back
* the change address would default to a legacy address
* there was no way to add native SegWit addresses ('bech32') to the wallet
All that is fixed in the new release candidate. You can put this in your `bitcoin.conf` config file and forget about it:
    addresstype=bech32 # "legacy", "p2sh-segwit", or "bech32"

What do you mean? There's a rule in pre-segwit nodes which explicitly limits the blocksize to 1 MB. It has been in place for years ever since Satoshi put it there.




Why false? Because you have redefined what block size is?




You keep saying that. It isn't true.




The situation Peter is describing is the miners soft-forking BTC to disallow transactions completely and creating a new coin with new rules. It doesn't result in any rules being removed.


The witness data is in its own merkle tree. It is a separate structure. You keep making false statements without any evidence to back them up.


The witness data isn't in the old block. That's the point. That's why it's a soft fork. The old block is still limited to 1 MB. The serialization of blocks has been changed to intersperse witness data into the transactions, but using the original block serialization the blocks are still limited to 1 MB. Redefining how blocks are serialized doesn't cause the old 1 MB rule to be removed.

Apparently lots of exchanges won't withdraw to Bech32 addresses, because they don't recognize them as being valid BTC addresses.

He knows that he can force you to honor that note, and so isn't taking any risk when he writes a similar note to the guy in front of him. This continues until the guy in the front row next to the vendor has a similar promise. He buys a hot dog from the vendor with his own money, passes the hot dog to the guy behind him and at the same time gets paid for it, possibly including a small fee. This process then continues up the line until you get your hot dog. Each person in the chain paid using their own money, safe in the knowledge that they would get paid back by the person behind them if and only if they pass the hot dog back to them.

It's true to say that the Bitcoin protocol has been evolving steadily since it was first created. Whenever possible these improvements are implemented as soft forks with majority agreement to avoid splitting the chain, but bcash deliberately split the chain by being a minority hard fork, making a new altcoin.
The original protocol had a much bigger and more dangerous scripting language, had no 1 MB blocksize limit, allowed anyone to create billions of new coins out of thin air at any time, and was generally broken. I don't know if it's fair to describe improvements to that broken protocol as "forks" of the protocol when the original version dies out and everyone upgrades to the new one. I think it's pretty clear that the Cash/Gold/Diamond/etc. forks are spinoffs/altcoins/shitcoins, since they each made incompatible hard-forking changes to the protocol without consensus, whereas Bitcoin never did such  thing.

And doesn't he mostly just copy/paste code from the Bitcoin Core project? So maybe "developer" is giving a little too much credit. What do you call someone who just copies things? "Scribe" maybe? I'm not sure.
2. They didn't really increase the blocksize. The average Bitcoin Cash block is smaller than the average Bitcoin block. They increased the blocksize *limit*, but it's mostly a moot point because almost nobody is using their fork.

They could change the rules that they acknowledge, but unless the holders of the coin also agree to their new rules their blocks would simply be ignored. The miners would effectively have forked themselves off onto a new altcoin chain. This happens pretty regularly. The most obvious example was when some miners started breaking the blocksize limit rule. They called the new coin "Bitcoin Cash" and for a while some people were tricked into thinking it was "the real Bitcoin". Most of them have since realized their mistake, and most of the miners have since come back to mining according to the original Bitcoin rules, with the 1 MB blocksize limit in place.

Bcash blocks are smaller than Bitcoin blocks not bigger. The blocksize limit is bigger, but since almost nobody is actually using Bcash that doesn't matter. Here's a screenshot of blockexplorer showing the actual size of recent Bcash blocks. Note how they're much smaller than 1 million bytes each:

Pre-segwit nodes accept all post-segwit blocks.
Pre-segwit nodes reject blocks bigger than 1 MB.
Hence there are no blocks bigger than 1 MB.
Soft forks can only add new rules. They cannot remove old rules.
You can redefine what you mean by block size if you like, such as having it include a new structure called the "witness data", but redefining terms isn't the same as removing a rule.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:26:24




That would depend on how the circulating supply was increased.
I can only think of three ways it could happen:
1) Allow miners to give themselves a bigger block reward than the current protocol calls for
2) Allow the sum of a (non coinbase) transaction's outputs to be greater than the sum of its inputs
3) Allow invalid or spent outputs to be spent.
The first is guarded against by existing nodes already. Each block is checked when it is received to make sure that the miner isn't awarding themselves more than the current reward plus the transaction fees for that block. If a miner tries to increase money supply by increasing the block reward their blocks will be rejected by the 98%.
The other two are also guarded against by protocol rules. There are rules that for each transaction (other than the 1st transaction in each block, which creates the block reward) the sum of the inputs must be at least as big as the sum of the outputs, and that all inputs must be in the UTXO set (ie. they must exist and be unspent). Every full node (whether pruned or archival) maintains a database of all the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that exist.

Because you don't need access to any private keys to *allegedly* sign something. It's only when you want to actually sign something that you need the keys.
To [*allegedly*]( sign stuff you could copy one of the real Satoshi's signatures from an old Bitcoin block, for example, or perhaps fake a signature by claiming to have signed a document but only producing the hash of the alleged document and never actually producing the document itself.

It doesn't really matter what you call it, just call it something other than "confirmed" once the payment has been made. You could all it "processing", "negotiating", "sending", or whatever you like before the payment is final, and "paid", "sent", "complete" or whatever else you like once the payment is final.
But "unconfirmed" and "confirmed" already mean something. They're L1 terms, and reflect whether a transaction is in a block yet or not. Why reuse the terms when you know it will only lead to confusion. It's almost as bad as setting up a company and calling it "coinbase.com" or "blockchain.com" when those words already had Bitcoin-related meanings.

How many addresses have BTC in them? Less than a billion.
Assuming it takes "an eternity" to brute force any given wallet, attempting to brute force all the funded addresses at once would speed things up by a factor of at most a billion.
So your expected time to find a funded private key by brute force would be about a billionth of an eternity.
Which is "an eternity".
A 12 word seed gives 128 bits of entropy. Suppose you could test a billion combinations per second, and that there are a billion funded addresses. Then your expected time to crack a single address is 2^(128)/10^(9)/10^9 seconds, or about 10 thousand billion years. That's roughly "an eternity", right?

Don't be so sure. Miners have been seen to be mining on top of the most recent block they've heard about before validating it. It's very quick to check the header and make sure that the PoW is correct, but it takes a lot more work to download and verify all the transactions within a block. So some don't bother. This invalid block today had a valid header. In order to notice that something was wrong with it you would have needed to download the whole block to discover that the reward was too high.

I can't answer for you. For myself, a neutral or average person, I use the LN to pay for things because it allows me to hold my own funds rather than relying on a third party to store funds for me.

There was no hassle involved and it works great for me.

You're missing the point that as a merchant, having your funds in an open channel makes them more accessible than if they're only on-chain. While in a channel the funds are instantly spendable for a very low fee. If you close the channel you can't spend them without making an on-chain transaction which could take a long time to confirm and/or cost a lot in transaction fees, depending on the current demand for block space.

I think "confirmation" when talking about sending BTC means a particular thing, namely that the transaction has been included in a block. To reuse the same term to mean something different when talking about Lightning is kind of confusing to people who don't understand how Lightning works.
If I give you a $10 dollar bill, and it took you 2 seconds to reach over and take the bill from my hand would you say the payment took 2 seconds to be confirmed? That would seem "kind of inaccurate" to me. There is no confirmation. The payment either happened or it didn't. There's no unconfirmed state on L2.

The lightning network is a network of payment channels. Each payment channel is a pool of money between two parties.
In our example there's a merchant, M, and a customer C. There's a channel between them which presumably the customer opened with his own funds. Let's say he put $100 into it. That means there's a pool of BTC worth $100 which will end up getting split between M and C in some way when the channel is eventually closed.
When the channel was first opened, the state of the channel was that C owned $100 and M owned $0 of the $100 pool.
Let's say that C buys $10 worth of stuff from M each week for 8 weeks. After the 8 weeks the state of the channel is that C owns $20 and M owns $80 of the $100 pool.
C notices that his channel is running low and decides to buy $50 worth of BTC from an exchange. It's an exchange from the future, and they support Lightning. C doesn't have a direct channel with the exchange, but he has a channel with M, and M has a channel with the exchange. The exchange sends him the $50 worth of BTC by routing through M. M ends up with $50 more on his channel with the exchange, and $50 less on his channel with C.
After the $50 payment from the exchange to C, the state of the channel between M and C is that C owns $70 and M owns $30 of the $100 pool.
In this way C can keep using his single $100 channel indefinitely. He can spend on it until it is empty, and refill it by accepting Lightning payments.
Does that make it any clearer?


The $100 worth of BTC changes hands when the channel is first opened - it moves from C's exclusive control into a more complex address that has various rules associated with it. It can stay there indefinitely. Bitcoin itself is also "more of an accounting system". It's a record of which coins are controlled by which keys.

Yes, kind of. Except that every transaction mixes all its inputs together to create all its outputs. So if I spend the block reward from blocks 3, 4, and 5 (50 each) and send 75 coins to you and 75 coins to myself there's nothing to say which blocks your 75 came from and which blocks my 75 came from. All we can say is that your 75 coins came from blocks 3, 4, and 5. Follow that process through the ever-forking history and you quickly end up with a mess. The coins in your wallet are likely from hundreds if not thousands of different block rewards.


No. You'd have to look at the transaction history. Without that you can't know where the coins came from at all.


The bigger concern is that some coins could be considered to be less valuable due to having been involved in a crime in the past. Suppose it turns out that some of your coins were stolen from an exchange transactions back in their history. You didn't steal them, but I might be worried about accepting them from you because maybe the person I try to sell them on to is worried that the next person he tries to sell them to won't accept them because ... and so on.
In practice that doesn't happen, but people regularly pop up proposing we should maintain a "black list" to determine which coins should be worth less than regular coins. They're usually shouted down pretty quickly.

You can't spend Bitcoin with a Visa card. When you use a Visa card you are selling your BTC for fiat and spending that fiat to the merchant. But what if the merchant wants to accept payment in BTC? Visa doesn't work in that case.

The best way to be sure you didn't miss anything is to sync the whole (~150 GB) blockchain and let the client rescan for coins. That'll take a day or two I expect.
I can do that for you if you like, but you would have to trust me not to steal any coins. I have a pretty good reputation, but potentially you would be trusting me with millions. If you do send it to me, use GPG to encrypt it to [my public key]( please.

There are several inaccuracies in your comment. You have the basics right, but lots of details wrong. Please accept the following in the spirit of me trying to help you understand better:


Not really. But the private keys can be derived from the seed phrase words.




That's not right. The word list isn't "numbered". The words themselves are used. If you were to convert your English seed phrase into a list of numbers and then into a list of the corresponding words on the German word list, you wouldn't end up with the same private keys at all. The seed phrase is language dependent.
See [BIP39]( for details. Specifically where it says:


ie. it uses the seed phrase, not a list of word numbers.


Paper wallets are typically BIP38, single address wallets. They don't have seed phrases.


BIP38 paper wallets are single-key entities.


That's not true. All keys are derived from the seed phrase, not from each other.

When the blocks are full a 5 sat per byte minimum would have no effect, since you would already be needing to pay more than 5 sat per byte to get into a block.
When the blocks aren't full, why not let people get their low priority transctions into blocks for cheap? I pay 1 sat per byte when I'm not in a hurry and don't mind if I have to wait a day or two for a confirmation. I don't see how forking the protocol to ban low fee transactions helps anyone.
Currently spammers could fill the blocks with 4 sat per byte transactions, forcing "real" users to pay 5 sat/B to get in. Your proposal does the same, forcing "real" users to pay 5 sat/B to get in. How is that fighting spam, when it has the same effect as spam?

I personally don't like the idea of hardware wallets because I would rather not have my private keys anywhere near an online computer, but every time I mention that I get downvoted so maybe I'm wrong.
When you plug your ledger nano into your Windows computer that's connected to the Internet you have to trust that the nano's firmware doesn't contain a bug (intentional or otherwise) that allows something on your computer to get access to your private keys. I would rather not take that risk, but I seem to be in the minority in having that concern.
Whether you use a paper wallet or a hardware wallet you should make a backup of your seed words, and so the distinction you make in your last sentence is moot.

The block was empty, other than the coinbase transaction, so there were no fees to collect.
But recently blocks have been collecting around 6 BTC in transaction fees. So if the block had included transactions it could have earned its miner around 19 BTC in total, which would be around around a quarter of a million USD at the current price.

Not really. If the software is malicious it can pretend to generate a random private key, but in reality give you one of a million private keys that the software's author pre-generated. It will look random to you, but the malicious software author simply sits back and waits for a big enough deposit to one of his million addresses and then steals it.

Horrible advice.
It looks like you possibly have 15241 BTC in that wallet, currently worth $229 million. Don't "sweep the key into blockchain.info". They have a long history of implementation bugs. It would be crazy to trust them with your money like that.
Download the latest version of Bitcoin Core. Make several backup copies of you whole bitcoin folder that contains the wallet.dat file, then let the new Core client sync the blockchain. It'll take a day or two. But that's not a problem if you're getting a few hundred million dollars, right?

No. The difficulty of mining is adjusted every 2016 blocks (approximately every 2 weeks) to try to make it so that on average blocks are mined every 10 minutes. Most blocks take less than 10 minutes to mine, and some take much longer. There's no maximum blocks mined per day. Recently (over the last 3000 blocks) we've been averaging around 150 blocks per day:
    $ python -c "print 24.0*60*60 * (540349 - 537349) / ($(bitcoin-cli getblockhash 540349 | bitcoin-cli -stdin getblock | jq '.time') - $(bitcoin-cli getblockhash 537349 | bitcoin-cli -stdin getblock | jq '.time'))"
    149.858553645
This is explained by the fact that the difficulty adjusts at the end of each 2016 block period based on the rate at which blocks were found during that period. But the hash rate has been increasing - it's higher during the current period than it was during the previous period, so the difficulty is still too lower, and will need adjusting up again at the end of this period.


No. Each block has to contain the hash of the previoius block in its header, so it is impossible to work on the next block before the current block has been found.


Think of mining as like buying lottery tickets. Every ticket has the same chance of winning, but the person who buys the most tickets has the biggest chance of winning. The only way to be sure of winning is to buy all the tickets. The miner with the strongest computing power has the highest chance of mining each block, but that chance isn't 100%.


We all started in the same place. Let me know if anything's still unclear and I'll try to explain it better.

Don't forget the last transaction in that block paid a 0.01 BTC fee, so the miners actually chose to create only 49.98999999 BTC. That's a million and one satoshis less than the 50 BTC the protocol allows. That's a million and one satoshis that will never be created which otherwise could have been.

It's a hard fork in the rules, but likely not in the chain itself, since it seems improbable that anyone will waste resources mining a block which exploits the bug.
@_date: 2018-09-28 15:07:10


No, because miners don't have to take their full reward if they don't want to.
The rules allow miners to take up to 12.5 BTC (currently) plus any transaction fees, but don't insist that they do so. They can take any amount so long as it isn't greater than 12.5 + the fees.
If you ask Bitcoin Core to run its `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC, it tells you something like:
    {
      "height": 543371,
      "bestblock": "00000000000000000003c35341881ac9604b4fd160c04377760f675dafb2f67d",

      "disk_size": 2913296067,
      "total_amount": 17291967.33005479
    }
but if we calculate what the maximum supply should be as of that block we get:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 543371
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 210e3 * (50+25) + (b + 1 - 210e3*2)*12.5
    17292150
which is 182.66994521 BTC more than actually exists.
I don't see any obvious examples of a miner taking way less than they're allowed to, but [this is an example]( of a miner taking 49.99999999 BTC when they are allowed to take 50.01 BTC.

On the other hand, [dictionary.com]( defines it as "a person whose wealth amounts to a million or more in some unit of currency, as dollars". I don't understand what "as dollars" means on the end of that sentence. Is it a typo for "such as dollars", merely giving an example of a unit of currency? Or is the definition specifically about US dollars? It's unclear.

To clarify further: unlike a normal double-spend which involves two conflicting spends where only one of them ends up on the blockchain this is a special kind of double-spend where both spends coexist in a single transaction.
I start off with 1 BTC and create a transaction which says "spend my 1 BTC and my same 1 BTC and send the total 2 BTC (minus fee) to a new address". The net result is that I have created 1 BTC out of thin air.
This attack would still work against 0.15 through 0.16.2 clients, but fails for 0.16.3 clients. The fix is a soft fork so as long as the majority of the hashrate is on 0.16.3 or later any attacker chains will be orphaned.

    182.66997251
ie. 2730 satoshis were burned overnight between blocks 543371 and 543463. I can't see how. Each block took a reward of 12.5 plus fees, ~~and no OP_RETURN outputs had non-zero values~~.

I'd say to avoid 1 and 2 since they are both basically keeping your coins with blockchain.info.
Keeping your coins safe is kind of complex, and beyond the scope of this reddit comment. I'm sure lots has been written about it before though.
Electrum is a pretty decent option for cold storage.

So you create transactions on your online computer and sign them on the offline one.

It is possible to do it by hand on paper, but not practical.
[This guy]( did a single round of SHA-256 in 16 minutes. A single SHA-256 hash takes 64 rounds, so would take roughly 16 hours if you worked at the same speed. You would probably want to do it two or three times to make sure you get the same result each time.


I would recommend using a live Linux USB stick. All Linux distributions I know of come with the sha256 binary.
Alternatively, go to  save a copy of the page to a USB stick, and load that up on your offline computer. Type the string into the 'wallet details' tab, hit return, and it will hash it for you and make a public/private keypair from it for you.
But again I must stress that this isn't a good idea. It's better to generate a random seed phrase than to make up a string and hash it.
Use something like  (which you can also save to a USB stick and load up on an offline computer) to generate your seed phrase. It allows you to input your randomness by rolling dice, flipping coins, etc. so you don't have to trust the computer to generate proper random numbers.

When running a full node you can choose to either run a full archival node or a pruned node.
* The full archival node keeps a copy of every block back to the genesis block. It currently takes around 200 GB of disk space to store the blocks. If you store the full block archive, you can optionally also store a transaction index which lets you look up arbitrary transactions in the archive by txid. That takes an extra 17 GB of disk space.
* Alternatively you can run a pruned node which keeps just the most recent N megabytes of block data, where you specify what N is. It has to be at least 550 MB.
In both cases your node will maintain a database of all the unspent transaction outputs which it uses to validate all new transactions and blocks it receives. Currently that database uses 2.7 GB of disk space.

The transaction ID is just a 64 digit hex number. It doesn't say how much a transaction was moving.
It is quite possible that when you request a withdrawal from binance they wait for a bunch of other people to also request withdrawals and then process all the withdrawals in a single transaction.
Check the outputs. So long as the correct amount is being sent to the address you asked them to send the BTC to you're good.
Analogy: I ordered a book from Amazon but when the van delivered it I saw that there were hundreds of other parcels in the van which I certainly didn't order! Relax, they're not for you. They were ordered by other customers and the van is delivering to multiple people on a single trip.

You are free to claim all segregated witness transactions as having been sent to you. Anyone on the current version of the software will see your transactions as valid, but those running the new version will reject your transactions.
Since the new rules aren't activated until some threshold is reached, the majority of the mining power will be enforcing the new rules and so the longest chain will almost always only consist of transactions which are valid under the new rules.
Since old clients see blocks made by new clients as being valid (it's a soft fork), even old clients will end up on the "correct" chain, and attempts to take the anyone-can-spend outputs for yourself will quickly be orphaned (if they are even ever mined in the first place).
@_date: 2015-12-20 08:35:11
No, it's not true. Bitcoin works on individual outputs, not on addresses. If you send ten separate 1 BTC amounts to an address of mine, I'll have ten separate 1 BTC amounts, and can spend any of them independently of each other.
I can't spend just 0.1 BTC of any them however. I would have to use a whole 1 BTC as input, and send 0.9 back to an address of mine as change. That's what we're seeing here - lots of small payments from a big output, each of them creating big 'change'.

What's annoying about it is that it usually causes some big-block advocate to chime in that raising the blocksize limit doesn't necessarily mean blocks will get bigger and so it's OK to do so. Which is clearly an invalid argument, since we need to guard against the worst case abuse of the system.

Miners will still be allowed to mine small blocks, sure, but miners and node operators will need to download and validate up to 20MB of junk transactions every 10 minutes. You can't opt out of that spam without opting out of being a full node. Full 20MB blocks would makes it impossible for some to continue to run a full node. And the whole "20MB is just the limit" argument doesn't work. If an attacker wants to he can easily create enough just transactions to fill 20MB blocks at relatively little cost.

I would prefer to sell at 500 and buy back at 400 for sure. The problem is that if I sell at 500 there's no guarantee that the price will ever go as low as 400 again, and so I may be unable to buy back in without taking a loss, much like your advice to sell at 1.85 and buy back at 1. It never went as low as 1 after hitting 1.85.

Because the bigger the blocks are, the bigger the requirements are for being a node, and so the less nodes will exist. Less nodes means less decentralisation.
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:15:08
You can't get the private key from an address. That's the point.
The way it works is you make up a random private key first, then generate a public key from the private key, and finally generate a Bitcoin address from the public key. Both of these steps are one-way.
Each address has a different private key. So when you move coins from one address to another the private key of the address holding the coin will be different, yes.

36:55 Interviewer: What would be the impact (of bigger blocks) on potential censorship or centralisation of Bitcoin?
37:03 Mike: Well I wouldn't worry much about centralisation, bearing in mind that anyone who wants to can run a full node.
This is very weak, and misses the point. I can currently run a full node, and I do. If blocks became 5 times bigger I would no longer be able to, due to bandwidth restrictions. As blocks become increasingly larger you increasingly limit the number of people able or willing to run full nodes and in doing so you clearly reduce the key strength of Bitcoin: its decentralisation.

Yes it's true. You can spend unconfirmed outputs.
I don't recommend doing so because A's txid can change (via transaction malleability) before it is confirmed which makes B invalid (since it refers to A by txid).

You seem to be saying we're nowhere near the currently limit, even before competition for block space has begun. That's good to know. So there's no need to change anything, right?
Increasing the limit increases the damage an attacker can do with a DOS attack. I currently run a full node. It uses ~10% of my monthly bandwidth allowance. I wouldn't be able to run a full node if blocks were 20 times bigger than they currently are.

That's just not true. Nobody (that I have read) is saying they don't want the capacity to ever increase.
Take a look at a random block. Half of it is gambling spam. People sending tiny on-chain bets to places like luckybit and satoshibones, and getting tiny on-chain results back. Those transactions can hardly be considered as worth keeping around. They'll move to off-chain services, as will all the other dust we see currently getting into blocks.

If there were 3 letters missing from the password instead of 1, you could loop through all the combinations by doing something like this:

    var password = 'egoijweofi';
    var chars='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
    for (var i in chars) {
        var guess1 = password + chars[i];
        for (var j in chars) {
            var guess2 = guess1 + chars[j];
            for (var k in chars) {
                try {
                    var guess3 = guess2 + chars[k];
                    var key = util.decrypt({ password: guess3, input: key });
                    console.log(' OK:', guess3, 'key is', key);
                    return;
                }
                catch (e) {
                    console.log('BAD:', guess3);
                }
            }
        }
    }
The output ends like this:

I just spent a while trying to recover funds from my BitGo wallet using nothing other than the two encrypted private keys and my password. Eventually I figured out how to do it. The program they provide at  doesn't work any more because it relies on an old blockr.io API that no longer exists.
I was able to modify their code to get it into a state where I was able to recover my coins. so it's definitely possible.
I'll document here what I did. Hopefully it will point your computer literate friend in the right direction:
I started off with these 3 pieces of information:
    A: User Key
    This is your private key, encrypted with your passcode.
    Data:
    {"iv":"WciY+E/Vu27Sdy5wt3FAuA==","v":1,"iter":10000,"ks":256,"ts":64,"mode"

    This is your backup private key, encrypted with your passcode.
    Data:

    vvVfgC0Wkp+iZy7PFTf9QCZx3AZxdQtEyxR006QNHW/3ymEGUz+iTNS6T/rwCmgYKHoAbg="}
    C: BitGo Public Key
    This is the public part of the key that BitGo will use to co-sign transactions
    with you on your wallet.
    Data:
    xpub661MyMwAqRbcF9exxCHKpHeEA2PdZwCSWVx6JP856MfheiA38V2t7PeeqpxVFjwYuVBKwUU
    QZMDwTE2MK3NzGzdRjGrzZLNMdbx74DzVTLY
and my password was `egoijweofifhu`.
The first thing to do is to figure out what your password is. You said you had a good idea of what it is. I wrote the following script which repeatedly guesses passwords until it gets it right. For this example I pretended I had forgotten the last letter of the password, and had it try each letter until it was correct. The key on the 2nd line is the key from section A of the paper wallet printout:
    var util = require('./util.js');
    var key = '{"iv":"WciY+E/Vu27Sdy5wt3FAuA==","v":1,"iter":10000,"ks":256,"ts":64,"mode":"ccm","adata":"","cipher":"aes","salt":"oMmVkBRXdPU=","ct":"qBDVqeJ/+1CXrPZusTi+yU6Xtitq7z6WYPVDOZWKWqrgrsipjOSx4vo6KxhIY7tlTYfMpsmcOkFkIAlNCYkRrkAE34xRGp27qxaYsVZC7SiSWdYZ0OYEWFYwInXR8bRiPCa6jh8J7gdrvLJcz6sAhj8A464IV1U="}';
    var password = 'egoijweofifh';
    var chars='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
    for (var i in chars) {
        try {
            var guess = password + chars[i];
            var key = util.decrypt({ password: guess, input: key });
            console.log(' OK:', guess, 'key is', key);
            return;
        }
        catch (e) {
            console.log('BAD:', guess);
        }
    }
When I run the script, it outputs:
    BAD: egoijweofifha
    BAD: egoijweofifhb
    BAD: egoijweofifhc
    BAD: egoijweofifhd
    BAD: egoijweofifhe
    BAD: egoijweofifhf
    BAD: egoijweofifhg
    BAD: egoijweofifhh
    BAD: egoijweofifhi
    BAD: egoijweofifhj
    BAD: egoijweofifhk
    BAD: egoijweofifhl
    BAD: egoijweofifhm
    BAD: egoijweofifhn
    BAD: egoijweofifho
    BAD: egoijweofifhp
    BAD: egoijweofifhq
    BAD: egoijweofifhr
    BAD: egoijweofifhs
    BAD: egoijweofifht
     OK: egoijweofifhu key is xprv9s21ZrQH143K2kLroa1U9DbY7gHMbRPUnS9DyXiCLcxzKczpHxB2DmMerMRTXtaaF14g9mJmFib1itrSsc8N2PFJooR75vvsWWWs2tXCXvH
So the missing letter was 'u'. Note that it ends up showing the decrypted private key, which will start with "xprv". Repeat the process for the other encrypted private key, and you'll end up with both xprv keys.
Now you have two xprv keys and a xpub key. That's all you need to gain access to your funds.
If you're following along with my example, my 3 keys at this point are:
    A: xprv9s21ZrQH143K2kLroa1U9DbY7gHMbRPUnS9DyXiCLcxzKczpHxB2DmMerMRTXtaaF14g9mJmFib1itrSsc8N2PFJooR75vvsWWWs2tXCXvH

    // BitGo has used two types of paths in its wallets.
    //
    // Newer wallets use this form
    //     userKey  :  m/0/0/[0,1]/n
    //     backupKey:  m/0/0/[0,1]/n
    //     bitgoKey :  m/0/0/[0,1]/n
    //
    // Older wallets use this form:
    //     userKey  :  m/100'/101/0/n   -- the first level is hardened, second
    //                                     level starts at 101.
    //     backupKey:  m//101/0/n       -- the first level starts at 101.
    //     bitgoKey :  m//101+x/0/n     -- the first level is 101 + x, where x is
    //                                     the number of wallets the user has
    //                                     created on bitgo.
Now my wallet was recently created, so it uses the new form - the first address in the wallet is created by using derivation path `m/0/0/0/0` for all three keys.
I made an offline copy of  which is a tool that takes a key (public or private) and a derivation path, and gives you the public and/or private key corresponding to that key and path. Work on each key in turn.
For the first key, copy the key (mine ends `XCXvH` into the 'BIP32 Root Key' field of the web page, click the 'BIP32' tab in the 'Derivation Path' section of the page, set the 'BIP32 Derivation Path' to `m/0/0/0`, and copy the first line of the table that appears under 'Derived Addresses'. Mine looks like this:
    m/0/0/0/0	1D77KSgFMhW3Z33ucVq7VV7UuGq7zf8LiL	02211ad9a3a4b01369b5fba07696c84550ffbbfd76075c7e2553dca82e1b3e8008	L1DbL5Xt5TxGPStgDNJBfFEv4gNWbB3dgYeQVLNDVU9nSwz79tZZ
For the 2nd key, replace the xprv key in the 'BIP32 Root Key' field with the 2nd key and again copy the first line of the derived addresses table. Mine was:
    m/0/0/0/0	11TJawjBvdkYjsN7hsEt11uPR78joQPnv	02724be8ef5062b84c5ffb4ad8c1a280a9432e22bc73f49915f09d778111f0b08b	L24J3GApn9dfcsjUdnDixG51x18sgNCeHCrUmU8tjSXP7LkENyB1
And repeat for the 3rd key. That one's xpub not xprv, but it works the same. You just won't get a private key in the table. Again copy the first line of the table. Mine was:
    m/0/0/0/0	1AkvHzZ2LWgH1qTuxJZZHdTVgKW7tcUAPt	033b124ec7be5613d21c6a6d6796677249bf822f7db00eea4760f9ef57cc089a53	NA
So now I have three first lines from the derived keys tables:
    m/0/0/0/0	1D77KSgFMhW3Z33ucVq7VV7UuGq7zf8LiL	02211ad9a3a4b01369b5fba07696c84550ffbbfd76075c7e2553dca82e1b3e8008	L1DbL5Xt5TxGPStgDNJBfFEv4gNWbB3dgYeQVLNDVU9nSwz79tZZ
    m/0/0/0/0	11TJawjBvdkYjsN7hsEt11uPR78joQPnv	02724be8ef5062b84c5ffb4ad8c1a280a9432e22bc73f49915f09d778111f0b08b	L24J3GApn9dfcsjUdnDixG51x18sgNCeHCrUmU8tjSXP7LkENyB1
    m/0/0/0/0	1AkvHzZ2LWgH1qTuxJZZHdTVgKW7tcUAPt	033b124ec7be5613d21c6a6d6796677249bf822f7db00eea4760f9ef57cc089a53	NA
I need to import them into Bitcoin Core and combine them to make a multisig address:
For the first two, I have private keys which I can import:
    $ bitcoin-cli importprivkey L1DbL5Xt5TxGPStgDNJBfFEv4gNWbB3dgYeQVLNDVU9nSwz79tZZ '' false
    $ bitcoin-cli importprivkey L24J3GApn9dfcsjUdnDixG51x18sgNCeHCrUmU8tjSXP7LkENyB1 '' false
For the third I only have a public key, so I import that:
    $ bitcoin-cli importpubkey 033b124ec7be5613d21c6a6d6796677249bf822f7db00eea4760f9ef57cc089a53 '' false
Then I combine the three to make a multisig address, making sure to keep the three addresses in the same order (A, B, C) as the keys appear in the paper wallet:
    $ bitcoin-cli addmultisigaddress 2 '["1D77KSgFMhW3Z33ucVq7VV7UuGq7zf8LiL","11TJawjBvdkYjsN7hsEt11uPR78joQPnv","1AkvHzZ2LWgH1qTuxJZZHdTVgKW7tcUAPt"]' '' legacy
    {
      "address": "36qXobfNhNjft8Y9YHPPfyfBqAGr6Gh3Fp",
      "redeemScript": "522102211ad9a3a4b01369b5fba07696c84550ffbbfd76075c7e2553dca82e1b3e80082102724be8ef5062b84c5ffb4ad8c1a280a9432e22bc73f49915f09d778111f0b08b21033b124ec7be5613d21c6a6d6796677249bf822f7db00eea4760f9ef57cc089a5353ae"
    }
That address, `36qXobfNhNjft8Y9YHPPfyfBqAGr6Gh3Fp` is the first deposit address as shown in my BitGo wallet. I can now spend from it using Bitcoin Core. I'll need to "bitcoin-cli rescan" to rescan the blockchain and find the unspent outputs on that address before I can spend them, but essentially the job is done.
Your wallet my be using the old style derivation paths, so instead of using `m/0/0/0` as the derivation path for all three keys, you'll want to use `m/100'/101/0` for the first one, `m/101/0` for the 2nd, and `m/101/0` for the 3rd.
Feel free to contact me if you need help with any of this. It seems to me the biggest hurdle is making sure that you have the correct password. After that it's tedious, but very do-able.

I would recommend trying to limit it to just the one guy who you trust the most.
I don't know how many BTC we're talking about here, but you'd be surprised how potential access to large amounts of BTC can change people.
The first step is to make sure that you have the correct password. Note that both encrypted private keys (sections A and B) are encrypted with the same password, and note also that nobody can access your coins without having at least two private keys. You have A and B (but they're encrypted). BitGo have C, and your password (but not A and B).
Knowing this, it is safe to give just one of A or B to your friend along with the password. The most he can do is check that the password works, and get the decrypted version of the private key. So long as you only give him one of A and B he can't access the BTC (unless he is BitGo, and also has C). Just be sure not to give anyone both A *and* B.

That's not quite true.
[The Wiki]( says:


That number is close enough to 2^256 as to make no significant difference.
Note that there are "only" 2^160 different addresses, so lots of private keys will give you the same address. On average each address has 2^(256-160) = 2^96 different private keys which can spend from it.

To open a lightning channel uses around 235 bytes of on-chain space, with a weight of 610 units. At the current fee of 0.25 satoshis per weight unit, that means the fee is 0.00000153 satoshis to open a channel. That's a little less than 1 US cent.
Once you have your channel open transactions are almost fee. Most transactions I've made on the Lightning Network have cost me less than 1 satoshi in fees.
Even if I have to pay onchain it has been quite a while since I've spent more than 10 cents on a transaction.

Do don't "post your wallet". That doesn't really mean anything. You post a Bitcoin address. That's what your wallet gives you anyway. You're just using the wrong word for it.
Your address starts with a '1' (if your wallet doesn't keep up with the times), with a '3' (if it does), with 'bc1' if it's on the bleeding edge, or with a 'q' if you have been tricked into using a fake Bitcoin wallet that is trying to pass off an altcoin as real Bitcoin.
Hope that's clear enough!

It's an exchange. People with real BTC trade with people with Gox BTC.

Yes. You are missing that the transaction will still be in the mempools after its block is orphaned. If it has enough fee and isn't double-spent then it will probably be in the block which orphaned its first block.

Mining is basically the process of finding a number that causes the next block to hash to a low enough number.
That's a puzzle that has no known solution other than brute force: pick a number, put it in the block, hash it, check if the hash is low.  Repeat.  A lot.
The network doesn't know whether I found the solution on my own on a single computer, whether I have a million computers all working on it, or whether I have a pool of a million people all working on it for me.
All the network knows is whether the solution I show it is valid or not.  It doesn't know or care how I came up with it.
How can we have it distinguish between a centralised pool and a p2pool finding the solution?

If you don't plan on moving your coins any time soon then the only reason I can think of for moving them to a segwit address is that fees are currently low, and in the future when you do want to move them it will be cheaper to spend them from a segwit address than from an old style p2pkh address.

1. The concept of sending coins to an IP address is very old. It was abandoned years ago in favor of sending to addresses instead. It used to be that you would specify the IP address of the recipient, your client would contact his client asking for a public key, and your client would send coins to that public key. If there was no client running at that IP address then you wouldn't be given a public key to send the coins to.
2. Clients won't let you send to invalid addresses. There's a built-in checksum.
3. So long as the address is valid, you can send coins to it. If nobody knows the corresponding private key nobody will be able to spend those coins.
4. The same as 3. If the private key has been lost, it's the same is if it was never known.

So to make it simple. You deposit 20 BTC, you're the only real customer, I misplace 10 BTC but want to 'prove' everything is OK by gaming the system.
What do I do? I find a conspirator who has 11 BTC, get him to deposit, put his 11 BTC in the tree beside a -10 figure, the two appear to you as a single account worth 1, the total tree value is 21 which matches what I actually now hold.
Is that the scheme?
It's equivalent to simply not listing to conspirator's balance or the negative amount. So long as we know some depositors aren't going to check the tree, we can leave them out of the tree completely. But this is also true if we were to publish as full list of account balances instead of just a tree hash. So I tell you "there's 1 account, worth 20, and look, I have 21 BTC!"
I guess to protect against this, we need to make it clear that balances not in the list have no claim to any funds. That would reduce people's willingness to conspire with us, and increase the likelihood that they'll check that their balance is indeed in the tree.

The way it works is when you contribute to the bankroll, we re-calculate what percentage of the bankroll everyone owns.
Then as bets happen, the bankroll goes up and down, but your share of it stays constant (until the next invest/divest event, at which point everyone's percentage of the bankroll is recalculated again).
So in that way all your profits are automatically added to your share of the bankroll after every individual bet (40 or so times per second).

I agree with you about the "above $50k" bet. If you lose you lose everything and if you win you win much less than if you simply bought BTC. But I disagree about this:


Suppose I own 1 BTC currently worth $8000. I think the price is going below $1.
If I take your advice I sell it now and have $8000.
If instead I bet the $8000 on the price going to $1 with 21.0 odds, I get $168k if it happens.
The bet is only a bad idea if the true chance of the price going below $1 is lower than 100/21 ~= 4.76% (which I guess it is - was that your point?)
Edit: I was assuming that the bets are denominated in dollar value. But I guess it's more likely they're in BTC. That switches things around. Now the "under $1" bet is stupid but the "over $50k" bet is better than buy-and-hold if it wins.

I used to use satellite internet. My provider wouldn't let me use more than 30 GB per month. I asked if I could pay more for a higher cap, but it wasn't possible. They suggested I could get a 2nd dish and a 2nd contract and switch between them each month.
30 GB per month gives me 1000 MB per day. At 144 blocks per day that limits me to a maximum of around 3.5 MB per block if I want to download and upload each block just once, and if I don't want to do anything else at all online.
I already have the blockchain downloaded, so the initial sync isn't an issue for me. But if I didn't, it would take more than half a year just to download the blocks which already exist.
I don't think you can honestly argue that increasing the blocksize limit doesn't decrease the number of people who are able to run a full node.
This is all offtopic anyway. I was attempting to counter your claim that SPV isn't trustless.

I tried a few more big payments. Each one cost about 1 satoshi to send hundreds of thousands of satoshis.
I agree that 35 satoshi isn't much, but compared to any of the LN fees I've seen it's over 10 times bigger.
@_date: 2018-08-05 11:49:02
Why was that payment so expensive in terms of fees?
I've sent bigger payments on LN and never paid more than 2 satoshis in fees. (I have a 100% success rate for large payments too. I did have a couple of small payments fail though).
Most nodes charge 1 satoshi as a base fee for relaying, and 1 millionth of a satoshi per satoshi for relaying. `lnd` shows the policy like this:
    "node1_policy": {
        "fee_base_msat": "1000",
        "fee_rate_milli_msat": "1",
    },
So even if you're sending a million satoshis you should only be paying 2 satoshis per hop.
I would be very interested to see a breakdown of the routing. It sounds like one of the nodes you're using is overcharging.

Exactly. There are lots of ways of adding a 12th word to 11 words and still having the checksum be correct. The program tries them all and checks which one has a history on the blockchain.
Given 11 words, there are 12 places you can insert the missing word, and 2048 different words. That gives 2048*12 = 24576 possibilities to test.
Each 3 words gives 1 bit of checksum, so a 12 word seed has 4 bits of checksum, meaning that 1 in 16 will be valid on average. So of the 24576 possibilities, we can expect around 24576/16 = 1536 of them to be valid.
I just tried the program on this seed phrase (I deleted one of the 12 words at random):
    deny fresh install curtain lady major spike cost transfer diagram degree
It found 1525 valid 12 word possibilities, a little less than the expected 1536, but close enough. But none of them had "existing wallets". I guess it's because the passphrase was generated by Mycelium and not breadwallet.
There's $10 worth of BTC in the wallet if anyone wants it - all you need to do is figure out which word is missing, and which position it is missing from.

I was thinking I'd donate 1% of JD's profits, as in 1% of the commission.
I don't know about increasing the commission again to "force" the investors to pay as well.  Maybe best would be to have an optional "1% for decentralisation" setting in individual account settings so each investor can decide for themselves whether they want to support it or not.
I wonder whether there's any negative effect caused by people being able to predict when a big donation is coming.  JD made some 900 BTC this week (that's unusually high - it's often ~100 or ~200 BTC per week).  In an hour or so I'll be taking 90 BTC from investors in commission.  1% of this week's profits would be 9 BTC.  If that was given out every Sunday, would that cause problems with people switching to p2pool just for the Sunday donations, then switching back?  Or is 9 BTC small enough that nobody would care?

Pruning witnesses is just as bad as pruning whole blocks. If everyone does it, no new nodes can bootstrap themselves.

Well that's the risk you have to weigh up.
I take precautions to keep the coins safe, and have no intentions of running off with the coins, but you can't know that for sure.
The only thing I can point out is that the bankroll used to be over 60,000 BTC and I allowed several big withdrawals taking it back down to 30,000 BTC.  If I was planning to steal the bankroll, that would have been the time to do it, when I saw my potential "haul" shrinking before my eyes.
But maybe I'm just waiting until there are 100k coins to steal...
If I wasn't running Just-Dice I don't think I would trust it.  I've been burned too many times trusting Bitcoin ventures in the past.  I happen to know that I'm not a scammer, but nobody else can know that with any certainty.
I guess another thing to bear in mind is that I get to take 10% of the site's profits without stealing anything.  That's plenty for me.  When 'fake theymos' guy lost 560 BTC yesterday, that's 56 BTC for me.  Who needs to steal when you can get 56 BTC just like that?

Is this a class in the scheme, that we need to include the account name in the hash input to prevent the owner from omitting one of a pair of equal balances (ie. we have two users with 100 BTC each, but list only one of them), but then the sibling (one 'b') node gets to see the sibling's name.
I guess you can just omit the word 'charlie' from what you show mark and it still works?

BitGo probably could help you out, as in they have enough information to technically help you, but they likely have policies in place that could prevent them from doing so. I've never used them and don't know what they're like to deal with. So if you have the 2 private keys and the password, that's the way I would go if it were me.
You can absolutely use the 2 private keys and the password to access the funds whether BitGo are accessible or not. That's the point. The service was designed so that you weren't reliant on them existing - you can get at your own money any time, with or without them existing using any two decrypted private keys. You have two encrypted private keys, and hopefully the password which can be used to decrypt them.

Interestingly the use of tasty treats can change the dog's response to the presence of children even after the treats stop coming.
The treats cause a change it the dog so that the presence of the child itself becomes a positive thing.
Our dog used to always chase the cat. We started giving her tasty treats every time she saw the cat. Eventually we would only give the tasty treat if the cat and dog touched noses with each other. Both the cat and the dog would get a treat for that behaviour.

Such incentive.  Wow.
The incentive to use a pool isn't so much that it saves you 12 Gb of disk space (because that's nothing, really).  It's that you get paid a predictable amount, every day, instead of getting 25 BTC every 2 years maybe.
That it, pools reduce variance and allow you to pay your power bill.  Making miners have a local copy of the blockchain doesn't change that.

What makes you think that? Did you read it somewhere? It's untrue.
When I send you coins, I don't need to know your public key, only your address (which is effectively a hash of your public key). You only publish your public key when you spend from your address.
Having the public key is a prerequisite to cracking the private key. If you haven't published it, the attacker is required to reverse the 160 bit RIPE hash to get it.

I just tried the wallet, entered a numerical passphrase and it gave me a 32 character hex key and 12 words. 32 hex characters is just 128 bits. Is that the size of the key I need to guess to steal coins?
Edit: I see  says this about the master key:

I would think having a copy of the chain would be useful if you're wanting to analyse the chain.


3 characters should uniquely identify the wallets I think. But Mycelium and Electrum end in the same 2 letters.


You're probably looking at BCash addresses if the wallet ends with "ABC".

That's a weird thing to say. We don't have to argue about how valuable dollars or Bitcoins are, we can just look up the market price. Currently dollars are worth about one six-hundredth of a Bitcoin. They used to be worth a lot more - just a few years ago they were worth over a while Bitcoin each.
Thinking that things are worthless because they have no physical manifestation is also weird. Is your bank balance worthless because it only exists in a computer somewhere? What about your Steam account, or cable TV subscription? You rely on your ownership of "virtual" things every day without even thinking about it.

There was a guy on bitcointalk selling them for PayPal at that price, but there was a limit of 40 BTC per week. I bought 40 BTC for $17, intending to do the same the following week, but forgot all about it after the first purchase.

You're dead right, percentages work how you think they work, but you're wrong in that you seem to think I don't know that.
Look at the last two lines:
    Jun  2 2014     0.22%   139.87%
    Jun  6 2014     1.99%   142.65%
142.65 isn't 139.87 plus 1.99, but 142.65 is 1.99% bigger than 139.87.
Also, look at the worst two weeks and the subsequent partial recovery:
    Sep 23 2013   -xx.xx%   102.84%
    Sep 30 2013   -12.66%    89.82%
    Oct  7 2013     7.69%    96.73%
    Oct 14 2013     7.09%   103.59%
We lost 12.66% then gained 7.69% and 7.90%.
Naively, -12.66 + 7.69 + 7.90 = 2.93, and so you might (incorrectly) think this sequence would increase your profit by almost 3% but the net effect is to take cumulative profit from 102.84 to 103.59 - less than a 1% gain.

If you think a 49.5% chance of having 100 BTC is better than a 100% chance of having 50 BTC, then betting it all on a double-or-nothing at Just-Dice is the way to go.

If there was some way you could announce ahead of time "I'm working at 4 times the default p2pool difficulty" so everyone knows that, and then you are only allowed to post shares with a hash 4 times lower than the default threshold, but get 4 times the credit for them?
I guess you could pass the other 75% (which qualify, but not for you) to a friend who is working at standard difficulty though.  So you would need to have ranges assigned to miners to prevent this kind of share-sharing.
And it's getting too complex already...  it's starting to sound like it would need a central authority to keep track of who is working on which range of nonces, etc. though maybe p2pool could do that in a decentralised way.

Just-Dice simply publishes a list of everyone's balance at the end of each week, which isn't good from a privacy point of view, but I think it's more important to prove solvency. At least the list is anonymised.
A few people have proposed using a Merkle tree instead of publishing a full list of balances, which apparently allows proof of solvency without giving away so much information.
Edit: I ought also to point out that it doesn't pay interest, it uses deposited funds directly as the site bankroll. So when the casino has a bad week, depositors take a loss. It's basically a profit (and loss) sharing scheme.

How batching works:
* Before batching. 3 users (A, B, C) want to withdraw from coinbase. Coinbase uses an old unspent output to send coins to A and makes change C1 back to themselves. Then they send coins to B spending C1 and making change C2 back to themselves. Then they send coins to C, spending C2 and making change C3 back to themselves. In total they've made 3 transactions, each with 1 input and 2 outputs, so a total of 3 inputs and 6 outputs.
* After batching. Coinbase makes a single transaction using an old unspent output to pay A, B, and C, and sends change back to themselves. In total they've made 1 transaction with 1 input and 4 outputs.
With batching they've avoided creating and spending 2 unnecessary change outputs. That's 2 transactions, 2 less signatures stored on the blockchain forever, 2 less txids, etc.

SPV clients trust miners without verifying transactions.
As written in  :
*In [SPV] mode, [...] broadcast transactions are still received, but those transactions are not and cannot be checked to ensure they are valid*
*in SPV mode the only reason you have to believe the transaction is valid is the fact that the nodes you connected to relayed the transaction*

Wikileaks started accepting Bitcoin donations when Paypal, Visa, etc. blocked them from receiving regular donations.

You can look at it either way: either the chance of winning is lower than it should be, or the payout multiplier is lower than it should be.  If you want to double your stake, you only have a 49.5% chance of doing it, not 50%.  And if you want a 50/50 bet, you only get paid 1.98x your stake, not 2x.
Basically for a 0% edge game if you multiply your percentage chance of winning by the payout multiplier, you would get 100 every time.  The 50% game would pay out 2x (50 x 2 = 100), the 10% game would pay out 10x (10 x 10 = 100), etc.
Just-Dice has a 1% edge, meaning that when you do the multiplication you get 99 instead of 100.  The 49.5% game pays out 2x (49.5 x 2 = 99), the 10% game pays out 9.9x (10 x 9.9 = 99), etc.
You can call it "rigged" if you like, but it's not a secret, and it's not dishonest.  The chances and payouts are clearly displayed before you bet.
[Merriam-Webster]( defines "rig" as "to manipulate or control usually by deceptive or dishonest means", so I'm not sure it applies here.

OK.  Here's one such scheme:
Suppose you have 1 unit and want to double it to 2 units, and suppose there's a 1% house edge.
To double it with a single bet, bet the whole 1 unit at 49.5% for a 2x payout:
    49.5% chance of winning 1
    50.5% chance of losing 1
    expected profit = -0.01
Alternatively, split the 1 unit into two pieces:
    Define r = sqrt(2).
    Make piece A = r-1 and piece B = 2-r
    The sum of the pieces is (r-1)+(2-r) = 1
    Bet A, aiming for payout multiplier of r*(r+1), percentage chance = 99/(r*(r+1))
    If you win, you've doubled your money.
    If you lose, bet B with the same multiplier.
    If you win, you've again doubled your money.
    expected profit = -0.0083014286
-0.0083 is bigger than 0.01.
Clever use of progressive betting has in fact increased your expectation.

At this point, nothing is confirmed. All you have is an unconfirmed transaction in miner mempools. The miners are free to do whatever they like.
[BIP 125]( introduced the ability to mark transactions as "replaceable by fee" or not. If your first transaction didn't have the "replace by fee" flag set, then miners are expected to reject the later higher fee transaction and keep working on the first transaction they saw. But there's no way of enforcing that.


If it wasn't marked as being replaceable, it will be rejected by all miners who are "playing by the rules". If it was marked as replaceable, miners will throw the first transaction away and work on the higher fee one instead.


Because it's possible a miner will ignore the gentleman's agreement ("mine the first transaction you see, not the one with the highest fee") and instead mine the one with the higher fee.


Yes, if the first one was marked as BIP-125 replaceable. And sometimes even if it wasn't.


Because "the network" is made up of independently acting miners. There are consensus rules which tell us whether a block is valid or not, but there are no consensus rules which tell us which of several unconfirmed transactions to include. The miner could claim that he never saw the first, lower fee transaction and was mining the only one he did see. How will you prove otherwise?


It's a trick question since there is no single "*the* mempool". Every full node has its own mempool which it is tasked with maintaining. Nodes are free to implement their own policy in regard to how they manage their mempool. Transactions can and do get dropped from mempools if they reach a certain age without being mined, or if the mempool grows to a certain size. When a node's mempool gets too big it will often drop the lowest fee-per-byte paying transactions.

I wasn't able to find any way of turning on Google authenticator protection without first turning on one of the other two methods, which both require a phone number (which I don't have). But you can borrow a phone, set it up, then switch to Google authenticator and delete the phone.

I does the android device. Now dns is working again and i tried following those instructions.
" Easy setup for Android users
Users who only access their Google Account from Android devices can use a short walkthrough to set up the Google Authenticator application on their phones. With Google Authenticator, you can generate verification codes on your phone even if your phone isn't connected to a network.
Follow steps 1-2 in the instructions above to access your 2-Step Verification settings and then click Settings."
There's no "Settings" to click on that page, so I'm still stuck.

I had a hard time finding Peter's post, and so thought I'd post the URL here to save others the effort.  My mistake was using Google to find it, not realising I was looking for a reddit post.  Google seems to be very bad at finding reddit posts, even if I'm very specific about the search term:


How can that be?

A few years ago I was approached by a stranger who had seen that I had contributed some patches to some open source Bitcoin exchange code. He wanted to set up a Bitcoin exchange for the Australian market, but didn't have the technical ability to do so.
I modified the open source software to suit his requirements, and he paid me a few hundred dollars. He didn't pay me anything like as much as we agreed he would, but one day the exchange was going to get big and popular and then I'd get paid, right?
Well, the exchange shut down unexpectedly, as they often do. Maybe the banks froze his accounts, maybe he just stole the funds, nobody knows. Lots of people were left out of pocket, but fortunately I was holding the exchange's cold wallet, and so all the Bitcoins on deposit were safe.
It took a year or so to get everyone's coins refunded to them, in which time the price of Bitcoin went part-way to the moon, and so I was able to make almost everyone whole.
Later, I set up a dice site with an interesting new model. I wouldn't have players play against my own bankroll; I would allow players to decide whether they wanted to play for the house or not; effectively the players themselves fund the bankroll. The problem with this model is that I am able to see the dice rolls before they happen, so I could play as an anonymous new user and will all the Bitcoins.
For a year or so I thought about making the site, but put it off because who would trust me not to cheat and win? Eventually I just made the site anyway because I wanted to see how it would go. To my surprise people trusted me with thousands of Bitcoins almost immediately. I can only put this level of trust down to the fact that I didn't steal the Australian exchange's coins when I had the chance to, and instead gave them back to their rightful owners.
So you may not directly make much from creating p2pool (or any other Bitcoin project) but the reputation you gain from doing it right can certainly be useful in the future.

I read reddit from my Android device often, and so the first time I find links to new sites, I'm on my Android device.
I may go on to use them elsewhere if I like them, but it's useful if they work on the Android device too.
Have you tried submitting patches to the bitaddress guy?  Maybe he would be willing to add some of the work you've done to his project.

From the FAQ:




I'm not seeing a way of connecting more than one twitter account.  It would be useful to be able to tip from whatever account I'm using at the moment.  I also have multiple github accounts, which I guess also isn't especially uncommon.
Edit: there's another very similar question that should probably be merged with this one:




That answer is confusing.  You ask that I "connect" my accounts, but that I need to "link" them before I "connect" them.  I'm not sure what "connect" and "link" mean here, or how they differ.  Are you saying I can link all my twitter accounts to each other, and then connect them to changetip?

The [Kelly criterion]( tells us that in order to maximise bankroll growth, we shouldn't risk too much of our bankroll on any one event.  It turns out that when you have a house edge of 1%, the optimal amount to risk is 1% of your bankroll per event.
That's what Just-Dice used to do.  But we suffered pretty heavy losses due to an unusually lucky big player, and so I lowered the amount we risk per roll to 0.5% of the bankroll.  That gives us an expected growth rate of 75% of risking a full 1% of the bankroll, but with much lower variance.
We use the large bankroll (currently it's of the order of 37,000 BTC - you can [see the coins here]( so that we can (relatively) safely offer very large bets to players.  0.5% of 37,000 BTC is 185 BTC, which is how much we allow players to win on any single roll.
I doubt many in the Bitcoin field have that kind of a bankroll to play with.  Crowdfunding the bankroll in this way allows us to offer large bets which other Bitcoin games can't offer.

Oddly enough, 50% is quite rare.  The most common bet is 49.5%, presumably because
a) it's the default
b) it doubles your stake if you win
50% pays out 1.98x

I keep lots of BTC in a single address that I reuse.  I figure the risk of accidentally using the same k value twice is much less than the risk of failing to back up one of the addresses if I keep switching addresses each time I spend.

Somebody lost around 550 BTC to the site today.
It could have been the owner (me) or it could have been somebody else.
Either way the people bankrolling the site get those 550 BTC minus a 10% commission that I take.
So I guess you have to decide whether I just threw away 90% of 550 BTC for the questionable publicity that this reddit thread brings the site.
I put it to you that for 495 BTC I could find more effective ways of advertising.
Unless you think the people bankrolling the site are fake as well.  I guess that's a possibility.  I could be all the players and all the bankrollers, and the whole thing is just for show.
Lots of people have made lots of profit from bankrolling JD - but they could all just be sockpuppets of mine.  I guess I can't prove anything much.
[MPIF]( is possibly the most well known [entity]( bankrolling the site.
MPIF contributed 50 BTC to the site's bankroll at Thu Apr 24 14:35:31 2014 and a further 113.15567101 BTC at Fri May  2 01:44:30 2014.
That's a total of 163.15567101 BTC.
Their share of the bankroll right now is 170.53277419 BTC.
That's a profit of 7.37710318 BTC in a little over 6 weeks.
Their contribution has grown 6.52% in that period.
I'm sure there are many others with similar stories.  MPIF is current the 43rd biggest contributor to the JD bankroll.  In total there are 1310 contributors.
One reason you don't see people talking more about their returns from Just-Dice is that the more people who get involved, the more thinly the returns are spread out.  It's not in their interest (or mine, in fact) to attract more funds.
So I guess I'll stop typing.  :)

I imagine there are lots of Google employees who could edit the date on an email in their database if sufficiently motivated. Emailing a document to yourself doesn't really prove anything, since emails can be edited after the fact.
Putting the hash of a document in the blockchain does prove that it existed at a certain date since the blockchain cannot be edited.
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:18:46


... and you won't. The whole point of the blockchain is to prevent double spends.
You can find pairs of transactions withdrawing the same amount to the same address twice, but that could just be someone honestly withdrawing the same amount to the same address twice.

I don't know if you've seen what we do at Just-Dice, but each week I publish a [list of depositor balances]( and use a single [well known address]( which I have [proved ownership of]( to hold the funds.

My question is why make three two-output transactions to split one coin into four when you can do it quicker and cheaper with a single four-output transaction?
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:53:58
Those withdrawals could simply be someone wanting their wallet to have a selection of small outputs in it rather than a single larger output. Then they're able to make instant payments without using unconfirmed change.
Basically there's a non-fraud explanation for the withdrawals.

I've been meaning to give PRC dice a proper try for a while too.
Earlier today I played a little with some "rain" I received in the chat. I think I received 8888 satoshis twice, and turned it into something like 120k satoshis, so something like a 10x win, then lost it all.
Then a few minutes ago I deposited 27 BTC, and it went like this:
I've now requested a withdrawal of 30 BTC. I've not received it yet, but [this link]( will show it when it happens.
The site seems trustworthy and mostly reliable. Would play again.

Betting in Bitcoin about the price of Bitcoin seems wrong somehow. Suppose there's a 50% chance that the price goes to $10k and a 50% chance it goes to zero. If Buffet take the bet, he either loses $10 million or wins $0. He's effectively betting that his winnings aren't worth much.

It was I who found the error in PD2, but you're misrepresenting it slightly. The problem was that every bet had a 0.005% smaller chance of winning than advertised, which means that something like 1-in-20,000 bets was settled wrongly. Not "at least" 20,000. It could be more, or it could be less.

I'm sorry.  I thought you understood what I was saying, but that we were just talking about different things.
Now it seems that you don't understand what I'm saying.
I'm saying that if you want to turn X BTC into Y BTC for any Y&gt;X, there is a progression of bets which give you a better probability of doing it successfully than betting the whole Y in a single bet with payout multiplier Y/X.
[This post]( describes how to turn 31 BTC into 32 BTC with a 96.7156% chance of success, whereas betting all 31 BTC on a 32/31 payout multiplier bet only has a 95.90625% chance of success.
Both strategies turn 31 BTC into either 32 BTC or 0 BTC.  The progressive bets have a higher probability of success, and hence a higher expected return than the single bet does.


Only if you keep playing forever.  If you have 31 BTC and decide to bet 1 BTC at 49.5%, and double on loss until you either win a single bet or go bust and then stop, then there is a non-zero probability that it loses all your money.  In fact the probability that it loses all your money is only 1-0.967156, which is lower than the probability that a single bet aiming to turn 31 BTC into 32 BTC loses all your money.
I don't know how else to state this.

Well, I take a cut of profits, not of bets made.  In the long run that should work out to the same thing, as profits approach expected profits, but that is either not happening, or is taking far longer than expected.
Site profits are around 11k BTC.  My 10% of that is around 1k BTC.  Expected profits are almost 49k BTC, so there's a shortfall of 38k BTC.  That's the amount OP is proposing I have stolen by playing as the big winners.  That's not "small potatoes" compared to my ~1k legitimate cut, and is probably the major factor leading to his cried of "scam".
Almost all of that 38k shortfall is due to a single lucky player, nakowa, who was quite vocal on the site, and was involved in heavily investing in (or setting up - it's not clear which) a competing dice site.  He tried selling his "winning strategy" on the bitcointalk forums, and generally made himself very visible.
If I was wanting to cheat the investors, I think it would be much better to do it quietly, with a series of winning bets spread out over time not drawing too much attention to myself.  Rather than going to the trouble of creating and running a whole new different competing dice site and drawing such attention to myself.
But again that's not proof of anything.  I can't prove that I wasn't nakowa any more than I can prove I'm not OP in this thread.

The problem is that when I try to send a large amount of dogecoin, a rounding door in the flowing point conversion adds a few satoshis to the amount that is sent, and so the wrong amount is sent. And when I list account balances, they're wrong too. It doesn't affect Bitcoin, not because doubles aren't used (they are) but because 21e14 fits into a double without rounding.

I talk to the players at Just-Dice all the time.  I never try to encourage them to bet.  I give them facts about probability to help them make informed decisions.  If there's a conflict of interest it's between myself and the people bankrolling the site.  I'm sure they wish I would shut up and let the players lose their coins thinking they have found a winning system.  I don't.  I tell them there isn't a winning system, and explain why.
In my experience it's very hard to get people to change their mind about whether to bet or not.  If I had said nothing, I'm sure he would have made the bet anyway.  I presented him with the fact that his chance of losing it all was higher than his chance of doubling up, and he still went through with it.
There's little in it for me whether he plays or not.  The expected gain for the house as a whole is 1% of each bet, so 0.5 BTC on a 50 BTC bet, and the house takes just 10% of that as commission, so 0.05 BTC, or about $30 or so at the current prices.
If I was trying to serve myself, I would have suggested that he bet the 50 BTC in ten separate bets of 5 BTC each, reducing the variance and making it more likely for the house to end up ahead.  I didn't.
And you're failing to report what I said to him on the site before he made the bet.  See [my reply in the other thread](




























As for this:






I don't know of any other site that lets you make bets of that size.  SatoshiDice used to, but with about twice the house edge, but last I checked they had vastly reduced their maximum bet size.  PrimeDice is the only other place I can think of that might, but I don't think they publish their maximum bet size and from what I've heard it may be around 30 BTC.
So if you want to risk 50 BTC on a single bet with a 1% house edge, Just-Dice is the only place I know will let you do that.

It only tells me that it is worth to that particular uninformed individual. To find out how much it is truly worth you need a market. Markets do price discovery.


No, it isn't. What do you even mean by that? The US dollar used to be backed by gold. That meant that each dollar could be exchanged for a certain fixed amount of gold. Can your bank balance be exchanged for a certain fixed amount of GDP or labor?


Most of the time. Unless your account was frozen, or you tried to withdraw more than was acceptable, or refused to tell them why you wanted to make the withdrawal, or the bank did a "bail in" with part of your balance, or your branch was closed. And if "it happens" all you get are cotton tokens which aren't backed by anything.


No modern day currency has backing. They are worth whatever people are willing to exchange them for. You can't eat Bitcoin, but you can't eat dollars either.
True story: yesterday my girlfriend was trying to send a few thousand dollars to a friend who lives about 200 miles away. The friend is coming to visit us and we asked her to buy some things for us on her way here. Unfortunately she doesn't have enough dollars to make the purchase, so my girlfriend was trying to send her the money to use.
The bank won't process person-to-person transfers over $3000 in Canada. There's a system called "interac" which lets you "email" money, but only up to $3000. You can't phone the bank, authenticate yourself, and have them transfer $4000 from your account to a friend's account. The only solution the bank offered was for my girlfriend to driving into town, go to her bank, withdraw a banker's draft, take it to the local branch of her friend's bank, and deposit that draft into her friend's account there. Except it was a Saturday and the branches won't be open until Monday. It appears there is literally no way the Canadian banking system can help my girlfriend get $4000 to her friend on a Saturday.
She ended up phoning around a few people and eventually found someone willing to "email" the extra $1000 to her friend for her, with a promise to pay them back later.
The purpose that Bitcoin serves is that you get to be your own bank and don't have to put up with this kind of crappy service. If the store accepted Bitcoin the process would have been so much simpler. My girlfriend could have send the coins to her friend, who could then have paid for the goods.
Yesterday I transferred $300000 worth of Bitcoin simply by tapping a touchscreen for less than 10 seconds. 10 minutes later the transaction was confirmed.

The less transactions you put into your blocks, the smaller your blocks are, the faster they propagate around the network and so the less chance there is of them being orphaned.

How about if there was a single well known address you could send coins to, and every 6 hours (or whatever) the
    bitcoind sendmany "" "$(GET 
command was run, donating 25% (or whatever) of the current balance of the address to recent p2pool miners.
* companies can prove that they are donating by showing the txid of their deposits to the well known address
* p2pool miners get a single donation every 6 hours, and can identify that it came from the "1% of profit" initiative
* miners currently mining at centralised pools have a single address they can look at to see how much the p2pool miners are getting, and so can make an informed decision on whether to switch over
* individual donating companies don't need to install, setup, maintain bitcoind and p2pool.
* you need to trust whoever owns the well-known donation address to actually distribute your donations (ie. it's a centralised solution to decentralising mining)
I'd be happy to set up such a service if there's a demand for it.

He has written some node.js modules.  I use one of them in the Just-Dice code.  It's not hard to find out that he's a real person.
I never heard of but his reddit account is over 3 years old, and he has over 67k of comment karma.  Is that a reddit account I've been saving just for this moment to stage a fake conversation about the site to - what?  What's the motivation here?

I think you have some fundamental misunderstandings about how Bitcoin works.


No, you don't.  All four can go to the same address.  bitcoin-qt won't let you do it unless you use its raw transaction RPC commands, but the protocol absolutely allows it.


Even if you do send to 4 different addresses this isn't true.  The 4 outputs of a transaction can be spent independently of each other.  I can't see what you're thinking that makes you think outputs must be spent together.  Think about when you pay someone and get "change".  Do you think they can't spend what you send them if you don't spend your change in the same transaction?  That's not how it works.


No.  Addresses don't matter.  They could keep all their coins at the same address without any loss in the ability to process withdrawals instantly.  The coins you send to an address don't "merge" into a single large output.  They stay separate.  Look here:
The address has 81 separate outputs available.  That means it could instantly pay out 81 people without waiting for confirmations in between.  All from a single address.

Are you talking about me?
I never colluded with an exploiter - what are you talking about?
If you're talking about the time that an untested change was put up which turned out to be exploitable and "sjess" exploited it, that was nothing to do with me.
I saw it happening, Dean asked me if I had any idea why the guy was winning. I looked into it, discovered that the site's provably fair algorithm was flawed, and told Dean about it. That's the opposite of colluding with him - I actively worked against the exploitation (and received no reward for doing so).
As for trolling, I can think of three instances where I have complained about the site:
1) I don't think it's fair not to pay people out when they win due to your own design being horribly flawed and untested.
2) I personally think it's silly to trust Microsoft with your Bitcoin site. They have proven time and time again that they're not trustworthy, and the outage last night was just one more proof of that.
3) Most most recent withdrawal was delayed, and when I asked why, the site owner refused to answer. He paid me out eventually, but it was quite concerning how he wouldn't tell me what was going on.
There's a log here:

We were [talking]( [about]( the merits of Martingale betting versus making a single large bet.
Then [BadWombat said](


By "spacing them out" he presumably meant rather than betting 31 all at once, space them out as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and stop when you win.  Else how was it related to the discussion?
If he meant to divide the 31 into N equal amounts and bet them at the same odds as you were going to bet the whole amount then of course the expectation is the same.  But that's not what Martingale betting does.
Betting 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 at 49.5% and stopping on a win gives the same two possible outcomes of either winning 1 unit or losing 31 units as betting all 31 units at a payout multiplier of 32/31, but has a better chance of success.
This is easy to see: you win the single bet
    99*31/32 = 95.90625%
of the time, and you win one of the 5 smaller martingale bets
    (1-0.505**5)*100 = 96.7156%
of the time.

I think you're disagreeing on what "return" means.
If you bet 1 unit and get 0.95 units back, you've made a loss of 0.05 units.
* BadWombat is calling that a return of 0.95 units (because that's what you got back from the bet - it's what the house returned to you)
* You're calling that a return of -0.05 units (because that's your net profit)

You're probably joking, but SatoshiDice has far less action than Just-Dice.
SatoshiDice operates on the blockchain, creating 2 transactions per bet.  Just-Dice operates off the blockchain, only using Bitcoin transactions for deposits and withdrawals.
SatoshiDice is slow - you have to wait for the Bitcoin network to broadcast your bet to them, often wait for a confirmation, then wait for the network to broadcast the result back to you.  At Just-Dice bets are instant.  Some people make more than 10 bets per second.
SatoshiDice almost twice the house edge of Just-Dice.  (1.9% vs. 1%)
SatoshiDice has much lower maximum bets than Just-Dice.
SatoshiDice has a very limited range of options - probably less than 20 different bets, whereas Just-Dice has an almost unlimited range of payout multipliers.
SatoshiDice's profits go to an unknown company.  Just-Dice profits go to hundreds of investors.  Anyone can be a part of the bankroll at the click of a button and share in the site's profits and losses.  (Especially losses, right fanniemaefnma?)

A site's hot wallet will typically contain many addresses (used deposit addresses, and change addresses), and so really is a wallet.
Off-site storage is likely a single address, but can still be considered a wallet. It's just a wallet with a single address in it. After all we consider paper wallets and brain wallets to be wallets even though they both represent single addresses.

If I'm finding too many shares, let me work on double the difficulty so I find half as many, but get double the credit for each one.

By cashing out the original investment you are deciding to trade some bitcoins (which have historically be trending upwards in value) for some dollars (which have historically be trending downwards in value).
You'll make sure you end up with the same number of dollars you started with, but they'll have less purchasing power than they started with.  If the absolute number of dollars you have is what is important then it's a good move.  Otherwise I don't see what you're trying to achieve by making sure your dollar wealth is constant.

That post shows an example of malleability by pushing an OP_FALSE in front of the signature, and the very next post shows a different kind of malleability, left-padding the signature with a zero byte.
I don't think satoshidice did anything to mitigate this risk, other than arranging to be sold for millions of dollars making it officially someone else's problem.  I could be wrong though.  They did stop accepting zero-confirmation bets after a while for large bets which would have stopped this attack working for large bets.

I have answered every question I have seen you ask.  You [posted on bitcointalk]( I [answered]( and you didn't reply, other than to say my post was "bullshit" in the Just-Dice chat.
You [posted on 2plus2]( and again I [answered]( and again you didn't reply, other than to say here that I'm unresponsive.
I've spent hours in the Just-Dice chat trying to make sense of your arguments, giving you the benefit of the doubt and trying to make you understand.  What is it you want from me?  How can I be any more "responsive"?


That information, as I have already pointed out, isn't enough to draw any conclusions.  You need to know the distribution of the bets.  If all but one of the bets was for 0 BTC then of course the results aren't going to be anywhere near to the expected 1% house edge, because only one of the bets counts towards the profit.  Of course that's not the situation at Just-Dice, but it's not far off.  [This post]( shows charts of the distribution of actual bets.  As you can see, most bets are insignificant in size.
[The data you requested]( and which I posted in the 2plus2 thread, should be exactly what you need to carry out the analysis you want to do.


I provided a list of every bet that was ever made, grouped by stake and chance of winning.  Before doing so I asked you how you wanted the data, whether you wanted the chance included or not.  You didn't know, so I provided the full details.  Again, this is the first I've heard that the data is "essentially useless".  How can I improve it?
I suspect that you were hoping I wouldn't provide the data so you could point and say "see!  he won't cooperate!  he's guilty!"  Sorry.


Can you provide any of this evidence?


We do not encourage bots.  You won't find any record of me ever saying I want bots on the site.  I don't think there's any way to stop them.  When people ask, I always say that I don't mind if you run bots, but absolutely don't support them, and won't be responsible for any problems caused by running bots.


In the early days we used to use a list of old-fashioned girl names, in the hope that macho gamblers would be embarrassed with their default name and choose something more interesting.  Then we switched to a list of "spooky" names for Halloween.  After that I switched to a list of "redneck names", since I'm living in rural Canada surrounded by a bunch of rednecks.  I thought it was funny.


The site has been running since June 2013.  We have regular players who hang around and chat all day.  Of course they get to know each other.  Over the last couple of months we've have a very big player come to the site most days and bet hundreds if not thousands of bitcoins.  Often he wins, and when he does it's not unusual for him to give coins to people in the chat.  Word of this spread, and before we knew it the chat was overrun with people begging for coins from the guy.  It's ugly and stupid, but what can you do.  It also causes "non linear" conversations, as people say stuff just to say stuff so they're noticed by the big player.


If you have any specifics you want cleared up, please just ask.  Is this where we're going to talk now?  Or will you find a 4th venue?  I've tried engaging you in the Just-Dice chat, on bitcointalk, and on 2plus2, but you keep moving on.  Would you prefer I don't keep finding you?  Is it inconvenient to have me counter your accusation that I'm non-responsive by responding to you over and over?


I'm willing to answer any reasonable question you have.  I don't want you to feel bad or crazy.  Please ask your questions.

The 42% growth is what you would actually have, after the site took its commission at the end of each week.
(You would still be due for commission at the end of this week, but only for 10% of the new profits you made this week.  So instead of the 42.93% profit you would be holding right now (it's gone up again, you would only have 42.63% profit after the next commission run).

You deposit, and it goes into your balance.
Then you can bet with your balance, or go to the 'invest' tab which lets you move some or all of your balance into the site's bankroll.
As soon as you do that, every bet on the site affects the value of your share of the bankroll, and you see it change in real time.
Whenever you like, you can pull it back out into your balance, and withdraw it.
There are no shares being sold.  You're not buying part of JD.  You're just helping to provide the bankroll for others to play against, and getting a positive expectation (due to the 1% house edge) for doing so.

Maybe it's a question for Edit: I went back to the message from the bot and clicked the "accept" link.  That fixed it for me.
Now I see "In the United States, the easiest way to get bitcoins is to , where you can hook up your checking account via ACH" (to what?)
And also: "Your balance is 2.210 mBTC. You also have 1.563 mBTC in recent tips that may not have credited to your account".  What's that about?  The list of tips shows two tips of about 0.78 mBTC each.  So what's that 2.21?  Are there "unconfirmed" tips?  Since we're off the blockchain, why might "recent tips" have not been credited yet?

This idea came up on reddit a couple of weeks ago.  Peter Todd described his solution, which looks to be the same as gmaxwell's:
@_date: 2014-06-08 19:20:43


The point that you're missing is that by breaking your bet into smaller pieces you can increase your probability of increasing your starting stake to any amount you like, compared to making a single large bet.  Betting 0 doesn't achieve the same goal, and has a 0% chance of turning your starting stake into any other amount.
This is precisely because there is a good chance that you can win the same amount as the single large bet would make but risk less, and the less you expect to risk, the less you expect to lose.
Again, this is a discussion of progressive betting.  If you insist on continuing the progression even after a win then we're not talking about the same thing.


I don't much care for your style here.  Does that ever work for you?

If I had let the system process all the withdrawals for me automatically that wouldn't have happened.

I've considered disabling the 'invest' button, and leaving the 'divest' button enabled.  So people can leave whenever they like, but not rejoin.
That would have the effect of reducing the bankroll to a more reasonable level, but I worry people would think I was trying to 'trap' investors by effectively saying "if you leave now you can never come back again".
Whatever I do there are going to be people who are suspicious about my motivation for doing it, even when it makes little sense.
I have no motive for attracting new investment.  It reduces my expected (and actual) income to do so.  As an investor on the site myself, I now receive a smaller percentage of every losing bet than I did this time yesterday, thanks to all the new investment that my alleged "shilling" has attracted.

No, that's not a strong argument.  I've been running the site for only 7 months.
The best argument I can come up with is that the site's bankroll was over 50,000 BTC when the price of Bitcoin was peaking a while back.  I had control of over 50 million USD worth of Bitcoin.  Then the biggest investor asked for his 12,000 BTC back.  I gave them to him.
Would a scammer have done that?  I see the price of Bitcoin rising, and investment falling in sync with it.  I've seen it fall from 60k to 50k, and now another 12k is about to leave.  I can reasonably think it's never going to reach this level ever again.
Isn't that the time to cut and run?  A scammer wouldn't carry on slogging away at the site every waking hour while giving $12 million worth of Bitcoin back to a potential victim.  Would he?
What did I do?  I sent him the 12k BTC, in two [neat]( [bundles]( so as not to have to have it all online at the same time.
I'm interested to see how you twist this into something nefarious.

Several times a week I get emails from people saying their withdrawal didn't work.
In 100% of those cases it has turned out that they're using the blockchain.info wallet, their withdrawal is unconfirmed, widely spread throughout the Bitcoin network, but somehow doesn't appear on blockchain.info.  They often seem to "miss" seeing unconfirmed transactions on the network despite being connected to lots of peers.
Once the transaction confirms, it shows up and everything is back to normal.  I've no idea why this happens, or how to get them to fix it, but it's pretty annoying to have to keep explaining the bug to users.
Another ongoing issue is that their wallet software often doesn't include sufficient fees in outgoing transactions, causing customers to complain that I'm being slow processing their deposits.  I wait for a confirmation, which can take a long time when the fees are insufficient.

Here's a log of the chat on the site around the time he was waiting for his deposit to confirm and deciding whether to bet.  Note how:
1. at 17:39:07 I told him how to make sure the bet was provably fair
2. at 17:41:18 I asked him to "consider whether you really want to do this. maybe having 50 BTC for sure is better than probably having nothing..."
3. at 17:50:13, when asked by someone to give him "the magic answer" (meaning to let him cheat) I replied that the magic answer is to "be responsible for your own decisions"
4. at 17:51:04, *** pippin (766509) [ bet 50.249 BTC at 70.7143% and lost ***
If anything I thought I was more likely to catch heat for trying to discourage the bet from some of the 1200 players who crowd-fund the bankroll of the site rather than from people who thought I was encouraging him to bet.  I clearly wasn't encouraging him to bet.

I don't know how the app is able to not know about a transaction that it has created a broadcast itself.  I checked on blockchain.info while the transaction was missing for the app and it was showing up there as unconfirmed. 
It's a good thing I didn't just resend the transaction,  assuming the first one had failed.
This happened twice yesterday, on 2 different transactions. Is there a bug tracker for the app where I can report this in detail?

You're forgetting the checksum. Each word is 11 bits. Each 3 words is 33 bits. That's 32 bits of information and 1 bit of checksum. 12 words is 4 sets of 3, so  gives you 4*32 = 128 bits of information, not 132.

I got as far as the introduction and found:


That kind of typo doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
Edit: I read the rest of the document, and found a few more typos:


*from* an extended period
For an extended period?




stealing people is usually called kidnapping


How about printing a QR code of this data alongside the text to avoid the need to type it? More secure than storing the data electronically, but not as secure as writing it by hand.


Double quotes in shell commands should be ASCII 34 (") not those non-ASCII characters.


The first thing we need to do *is* to verify... (missing 'is').


Don't you mean "or that *doesn't spend* much time on your [...] network"?




This typo occurs twice.


Replace 'your cold storage' with 'the destination'.


They *eliminate* the risk. They don't *eliminates* it.
One shortcoming that strikes me is it seems that in order to withdraw from cold storage I need to bring two keys into the same physical location. That seems risky. I would prefer to create a raw transaction and sign it with the first key in the first key's location, then take the half-signed transaction to the second key's location to complete the signature. The current protocol appears to be vulnerable to a thief stealing all the coins at the point of transaction signing.

If you set AD to a finite number then you will potentially start accepting blocks which are only valid on one of the BU chains once they have that finite number of confirmations on that BU chain.
That's OK for as long as people belive that BU chain to represent something of value, but once it becomes clear that the economic majority is staying on the Bitcoin ("small block") chain the price of the BU altcoin(s) will drop pretty close to zero.
The loss of funds comes from accepting the BU altcoin believing it to be Bitcoin, and later finding out that it was just another failed takeover attempt.

OR you get to pick the chance of winning, and the house tells you the payout multiplier.
The two always multiply to give 99%.

9% chance of winning pays 11x.






No, but who said 49.5% chance?  I said:
    percentage chance = 99/(r*(r+1))
such that the chance times the payout is 99%.

* One guy said it was the same.
* I said it was better to use a progression.
* Someone said "prove it"
* I proved it.
* Now someone is complaining that I broke the rules by breaking my bankroll up into a series of smaller bets.  But that's what progressive betting *is*.  They're also complaining that you don't get to pick your chance of winning.  But you *do*.

Transaction malleability allows a third party to take one of your pending transactions and double spend its inputs. There are various ways of doing it.
All confirmed transactions show on the blockchain. Two confirmed transactions sending the same amount from the same address isn't evidence of TM though. Here's a pair of transactions I made yesterday:
You're right they show on the blockchain, but does it prove TM? I created these two transactions separately by clicking 'send' twice.

2. coin.dance is counting anything it can connect to which claims to be a BU node, but doesn't check whether they are really nodes or not. Maybe there are lots of connectable fake BU nodes which never try connecting to other peers.
3. maybe BU nodes prefer to connect to other BU nodes and so aren't connecting to me.

If their transaction confirms before the fork you have coins on both branches of the fork. It could confirm separately on both branches after the fork, in which case the outcome would be the same.


It depends on how the fork is implemented. The Ethereum fork for instance made no effort to distinguish transactions intended for one branch from those intended for the other, and so it was possible to rebroadcast transactions between branches. I can't imagine the BU coder will be any more careful than the Ethereum project was given his past performance, so this could be an issue again.
I think most Bitcoiners are sane enough to recognize that a hard fork now isn't a good idea, so I don't think BU is anything to worry about. Just as 'Classic' and 'XT' weren't anything to worry about before it.

I tried to remain unbiased. In truth I'm in the Core camp and think the BU people are misguided. I run several full nodes so that I don't have to trust third parties. The one I run locally over limited monthly capped satellite Internet is just about managing to stay within the monthly bandwidth limits.

There are multiple exchanges. Each has its own markets. The price on each market is set by the players in those markets. If the price between any two markets diverges enough then there's profit to be made buying on the cheap one and selling on the expensive one, which will tend to bring the two prices closer together.
But no, there's no "standard". There are various people taking averages of the different market prices to give an overview of the price, but I don't know that you could call it a standard. The price of Bitcoin is whatever you and the person you're trading with agree it to be.

At 21:40 they're talking about a transaction of Roger's which never confirmed. Roger claims that it didn't confirm because "the blocks were full" but the truth, as I have pointed out to Roger several times, is that it didn't confirm because a malleated version of one of its parent transactions had already confirmed. SegWit would have solved this problem since it fixes transaction malleability. Roger knows this but continues to lie about it. In my eyes this makes him nothing but a troll.﻿

BU has a setting which 'allows' miners to change the blocksize limit. Core doesn't.
In either case miners could edit and rebuild the source code to change the blocksize limit without anyone 'allowing' them to do so.
Maybe 'allowing' was a bad choice of word. Is 'encouraging' better perhaps? 'Enabling'?
When BU has a setting exposed to the user which tinkers with the blocksize limit, the user might come to the conclusion that tinkering with the blocksize limit is a good idea. Hiding the parameter from the user doesn't stop them changing it, but does make it less likely that they will do so.


I thought the BU parameters made it so the network parameters could be changed if just 75% of the hashrate decided to do so. That could be just a small handful of people, and far from "overwhelming consensus".


Miners don't decide what constitutes a good block. Miners follow the established rules or they get their blocks orphaned on the Bitcoin chain. Miners work for the economic majority, not the other way around. If they stop doing so, they stop getting paid.

I don't think the price they quoted you for PayPal includes the foreign exchange (USD -&gt; CAD) conversion fee, so it's probably not all that close.
Quadriga don't set the prices. They don't buy or sell Bitcoins. All they do is match buyers up with sellers. The buyers and sellers set the prices. Whenever there's a seller willing to sell at a price that a buyer is willing to pay, the exchange matches the two and takes 0.5% off both parties.
You can see the current orderbook here:  - you can watch it change in real time.
Right now the cheapest anyone is selling BTC for is 1,568.85 CAD and the highest anyone is willing to pay is 1,551.52 CAD. I think that represents a 0.5569% effective fee:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; (sqrt(1568.85 / 1551.52) - 1) * 100
    0.5569337070902014
But you don't have to take the current highest price someone is offering. You can place a new order on the books undercutting the current lowest sell price and wait for someone to match it. The problem then is that the price might move against you, and you'll have to drop your selling price to get matched.

They don't though. Your private key is 256 bits. Each 3 words contribute 32 bits, so 12 words give you just 128 bits.

You are allowed to change settings for yourselves. It's a bad idea to do so, and so Bitcoin Core isn't adding the ability to change the settings.
If you want to change consensus settings such that you potentially end up accepting invalid blocks you are free to run a client which doesn't follow consensus rules, like BU.
Nobody is stopping you from running whatever code you want to run, but responsible people are trying to make it clear that it's not a good idea for everyone to be able to pick their own "consensus" settings, even though that should be obvious.

Bitcoin always skipped signature validation for transactions contained in blocks earlier than the checkpointed block. Not only that, but it wouldn't accept longer valid chains which didn't contain the checkpointed block. Checkpoints forced us onto a particular version of the chain even if it wasn't the longest.
This new feature appears to allow the client to keep skipping signature validation for old blocks but no longer forces us onto a particular blessed chain fork.

How can both of these statements (in the review linked above) be true?
1. The keys are never transferred out of the device
2. The mnemonic seed can be stored in a micro SD card, allowing the wallet to be backed up offline
If the seed can be used to generate the keys, and the seed is on an SD card which can be removed from the device, doesn't that mean the keys can be transferred out of the device simply by removing the SD card?

No.  You only need to make the "check balance then subtract from balance" atomic.  The "add to withdrawal queue and process withdrawal" can happen any time later.
All you're trying to do is prevent two separate "check balance" calls from succeeding before either of the "subtract from balance" calls has run, and you do that by making the "check then subtract" operation atomic.

That's not true. They are designed to anonymize all transactions, suspicious or not, and the make it impossible for anyone to trace them, whether the spies be government agencies, corporations or individual private people.

That's the "con" I listed...
Edit: I mean the service itself would be centralised, but it would be easy to check that it was operating honestly, by watching the blockchains (the Bitcoin one, and the p2pool one).  That's clearly better than a centralised service that doesn't use the p2pool network to decide how much to send each miner, but is clearly not ideal either.
@_date: 2017-02-12 08:06:00




As you wrote, the p2sh script looks like this:
    OP_HASH160 &lt;script hash&gt; OP_EQUAL
For pre-p2sh nodes that means "if the spender can provide a script with the correct hash, they can spend this output".
For post-p2sh nodes the meaning changes to "if the spender can provide a script with the correct hash, *and that script is satisfied by the provided inputs*, they can spend this output.
So the attacker only needs to wait until something is spent from the p2sh address once, and then they know the script. They won't be able to satisfy the script, but pre-p2sh nodes don't care about running the script, they only care that it has the correct hash. Which it will.

The first thing to check is whether you have limited `maxconnections` in your `bitcoin.conf`. It defaults to 125, but maybe you have accidentally set it to something lower.
Often when people aren't seeing many connections it's because they don't have the p2p port forwarded on their router or aren't listening for inbound connections. But since you're seeing at least some inbound connections that can't be the problem either.
I'm running a node with `maxconnections=64` in the config, and it always seems to have 63 connections in total. I don't know if there's an off-by-one error somewhere:
    $ bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep inbound | sort | uniq -c
          8     "inbound": false,
         55     "inbound": true,
I'll try running it with a bigger limit and see how many it gets then.
I can't think of any other reason why you are only seeing 10 incoming connections. If you PM me your node's IP address I can try connecting to it and see if it's accepting more connections or not.
It's good to be able to accept more incoming connections, because some nodes aren't able to accept incoming connections and so need to find listening nodes with free connection slots in order to get onto the network. SPV wallets also need to find listening nodes to connect to.

I guess I also have to publish the root of the tree in a public place, or I could give completely different trees to each user, and hide some funds.  Tell the 9k user "here's your 9k and everyone else's 1k", and tell the 4k guy "here's you 4k and every else's 6k", telling everyone the total is 10k, but in different ways?

The cost is that you don't get to collect the fees from the real fee-paying transactions you didn't include.
I can decide to either mine real transactions, paying 100 satoshis per byte each, or my own fake transactions, paying 200 satoshis per byte each.
If I mine real transactions I get 1 BTC in fees (100 satoshis per byte times a million bytes = 100 million satoshis = 1 BTC).
If instead I mine my own transactions I get nothing from fees, since I'm paying myself.
The cost is effectively the 1 BTC I would have earned but didn't.

High level overview:
* Core values **security** over everything else. Allowing miners to set the blocksize limit could lead to further centralization, making the network more susceptible to attack. We need to keep the network as decentralized and secure as possible, and add capacity using second layer (offchain) solutions.
* BU values **adoption** over everything else. It doesn't matter if Bitcoin becomes "PayPal 2.0" so long as it gets widely adopted. We need bigger blocks now or else potential Bitcoin users will go somewhere else because there's no room in the blockchain for their transactions.

The chance you're OK is (255/256)^3, so the percentage chance that the bug happens is 100 - ((255/256)^3 * 100) or 1.17%. The result is much the same as 300/256.

It's a lot slower to test a wallet passphrase than it is to test a private key. So long as his passphrase has more bits of entropy than a private key he hasn't compromised security at all by posting his wallet. Unless of course a flaw is found in the encryption itself.
Edit: It would be possible to replace the encrypted private key in the wallet.dat file that he uploaded with that of an empty address so that there's no way of recovering the private key. Then there's no risk at all, and we wouldn't be able to tell the difference until we knew the encryption passphrase.

I made a transaction 2 days ago for about 5 BTC. It was around 600 bytes long and I paid around 6000 satoshis in fee. I always pay 10 satoshis per byte just to check whether that is still enough. So far it always has been. My transaction took 31 hours to confirm.
So I paid $0.06 for a $5,000 transaction. That's a 0.0012% fee. Not that percentages matter - it's based on the size of the transaction, not the value. But 6 cents for eternal storage on a globally distributed blockchain seems like a good deal to me.

I see two ways this could affect you:
If you created and funded your wallet on a correctly implemented wallet (eg. Trezor) and try to recover it on one with an incorrect BIP32 implementation (eg. CoPay) then you have about a 1.17% chance of seeing an incorrect 0 BTC balance.
Similarly if you created and funded your wallet on an incorrectly implemented wallet (CoPay) and try to recover on one with a correct BIP32 implementation (Trezor) then you also have about a 1.17% chance of seeing an incorrect 0 BTC balance.
The first case will likely be corrected. CoPay will start checking both the correct and incorrectly derived addresses in the future. The second case will likely not be corrected since it would require Trezor (for example) to add code to work around a CoPay bug.
If you stick with the wallet you started with you won't have an issue.

The site takes 10% of new investor profits at the end of each week.
This 'theymos' account just lost a total of 565 BTC.  Assuming nobody wins it back before Sunday (when I take the 10%), the site will get a little less than 10% of that.  Less because some investors are recovering old losses, and so not making *new* profit, and so not paying any commission yet.
But I guess the site is currently due about 52 BTC on that loss, which is worth about $34k at the current price.
That's about 10 times less than your guess.  I expect you were forgetting that over 90% of the loss goes directly to the people who crowd-source the site's bankroll.

1) If writing is too aversive, you can always use a printer. I just worry about the printer's non-volatile memory possibly being a security problem.
2) BIP39 only uses 2048 rounds of hashing for its passphrase, so it's important to use a strong passphrase. Is this more or less secure than the encryption used on the DBB's SDCard?
3) The screen of the offline device you used to convert your secure entropy source into BIP39 words. I use an old laptop with no Internet connectivity.
My question is about how secure the SDCard backup is, and how it compares to BIP39. I'm aware that BIP39's passphrase protection is weak, but am not aware of how well it compares with whatever the DBB is using to protect its seed, if anything.

Bitcoin isn't hard to buy. The problem is that dollars are hard to send reliably.
You can use PayPal to send them, but the next day you can "unsend" them by lying about fraud or something.
If you have a good safe irreversible way of getting me $1400 by tomorrow I'll send you 1 BTC as soon as it arrives. But you don't.
This is one of the ways in which BTC is better than USD.

So it doesn't matter how secure the high-security chip is when it gives up its secrets on demand to the (presumably) less secure MCU.
I feel like an asshole for continuing to attack like this. I'm hoping the device is actually secure and that it is only your website's communication regarding its security that is poorly done.

I don't understand this idea of dollar cost averaging.
If I think the price of Bitcoin will be trending upwards over time and I have $1200 to "invest" in it, I can either:
a) buy $1200 worth right now, or
b) buy $100 worth each month for the next year
I think the price is going to go up over the next year, so doesn't that mean I would probably end up with less if I went for option b) than if I went for option a)?
Maybe what you're doing by dollar cost averaging is decreasing variance at the cost of also decreasing expected profit. Could that be the point of it? I wouldn't be wanting to buy at all if I didn't think the price was going to trend upwards. And if it's trending upwards then the expected price in a month is higher than the price now. By dollar cost averaging I reduce the downside if we happen to be in a local maxima right now, but increase the downside if we happen to be in a local minima right now (ie. maybe the price bounces back to $1150 tomorrow and climbs from there). Those two effects should balance each other out, and so I'm left with a straight line, trending upwards. When's the best time to buy if that's the case? Right now, no?

Miners have always been able to rebuild their own versions of the client.
Doesn't it make sense that we add new configuration parameters to let them decide their own block rewards? We could have thresholds so that they could signal in advance how much they were going to pay themselves, and all each node to ignore oversized rewards for a configurable number of blocks.
We could call it "nakamoto consensus", and miners could decide to pay themselves however much they wanted.
What could possibly go wrong with allowing miners to change Bitcoin however they like without considering the impact on the users who give Bitcoin its value?

You know that "SF" stands for "soft fork", right? And that a soft fork isn't "same thing" as a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:08:44
If it changes a rule, it's a hard fork. That's the point.
Soft forks only add new rules, they can't change old rules.
"This new thing that used to be allowed is now prohibited" = soft fork. All blocks satisfying the new rule also satisfy all previous rules, and so are accepted by all nodes, even those who don't know about the new rule. Example: "blocks cannot be larger than 10k bytes". The old "blocks cannot be larger than 1000k bytes remains in place. No rule was changed; a new rule was added. It's a soft fork.
"This thing that used to be prohibited is now allowed" = hard fork. Some blocks which used to satisfy all the rules are now invalid. Nodes which didn't update will reject some blocks which new nodes create, forking them onto a different chain. Example: "blocks cannot be larger than 2000k bytes, but scratch the old 1000k byte limit rule". That's cancelling an old rule. It's a hard fork.
It's a fundamental difference.
@_date: 2017-02-13 17:59:00
I didn't downvote, but I imagine the problem people have with your comment is that it is focused on a particular solution and not the goal.
What we need is scalability. More tps. Whether that is achieved by making the blocks bigger or some other method isn't something that matters so long as the solution is safe. Why get hung up on one particular solution if alternative safer solutions are available?
Silly analogy: When we found that travel by horses wasn't fast enough there was one guy insisting that the solution was to breed horses with double-length legs. He resisted the deployment of the automobile because he was so hung up on the obvious solution that longer legs = faster horses. All we needed was faster transport. The people delayed the activation of the automobile just because it wasn't their chosen solution. "I don't care what kind of automobile you invent. So long as it has longer legs".

Currently the supply of BTC is increasing at around 4% per year.
Previously it was much higher. In the second year for example the supply doubled - that's 100% monetary inflation, and it was theoretically possible for everyone to double their holdings.

I read through the FAQ and found a few typos and points of confusion for me:










That reads as if you can use it to move the funds out which it's still sealed. Probably just an ambiguous phrasing of the sentence though.


What if I give two devices the same numbers? Will they generate the same private key?


Hashing files on my computer to generate a private key seems like a dangerous way to generate entropy. Couldn't an attacker repeat the process and get at the same private key if they ever get access to my files? 250k bits is only 32000 bytes. If the first file I copy onto the device is &gt;32k then the private key will be determined by just that file, and the same file can be used to regenerate the private key on another device?


Oh, OK. You should have told me that earlier... is the unit serial number impossible to find out?


Earlier you said it was 250k bits. Now it's 256k bytes. Which is it?

Almost everyone is telling you that your attack wouldn't work, but I don't see any reason that it wouldn't.
Wallets are pretty bad at selecting which unspent outputs to use when making a transaction. Bitcoin Core, for instance, does its very best to get the change amount as close to 0.01 BTC as it can. It doesn't make any attempt to minimize the transactiion fee. So if you sent a million single-satoshi outputs to my address you would probably end up costing me a lot more (in fees) than it cost you.
While it is true that the victim of the attack doesn't have to spend the dust you send him, in practice most wallets won't try to avoid spending the dust, and most users don't do manual coin selection.

Well, they say it hashes 256kB of data (or 250kb, depending on which bit you read), not all the data, and that it's possible to verify the key generation by repeating the algorithm for yourself - so it must be deterministic (given the input data, entropy, and serial number).

Less steps:
1. Open Quadriga account
2. Provide merchant your Quadriga deposit address; they will send BTC to your Quadriga account, charging you 1%
3. Exchange BTC for CAD on Quadriga. They will charge a 0.5% fee for the exchange.
4. Withdraw CAD to your bank account. They have various withdrawal methods, with various fees (including some with no fee):  . "Bank wire" and "check in the mail" are both free, but take a week or so.
So in total you're paying 1.5%, but possibly losing a bit more on the spread on the exchange (the gap between the buy price and sell price). It's also possible (likely even) that the price of BTC will change in the time between you buying and selling it. That would be good or bad for you depending on the direction of the change.

 * right: You are **830,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times** more likely to win the lottery than for a bitcoin collision to occur.
It changes the meaning of the word 'times' from counting occurrences to implying multiplication.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 2**160 / 1e10 / 176e6
    8.30e+29
This is only considering the chance for a collision to occur when you generate a single new address, and doesn't take into account the chance that a collision has already occurred within the first 10 billion addresses, which is closer to:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 2**160 / 0.5e20 / 176e6

Your question implies that "increasing the blocksize" should be a goal, whereas it is one possible solution to a problem.
The goal is "increase transaction throughput". There are better ways of doing this than increasing the blocksize limit. Adopting Schnorr signatures will allow transactions to be smaller, directly increasing the throughput. Adopting SegWit will make the effective blocksize limit bigger without triggering a hard fork. It will also make untrusted offchain transactions a reality, increasing the throughput.
Eventually it is likely that we reach a limit on how much throughput can be achieved with 1MB blocks, but we are nowhere near that point yet.

I received a reply in private to this comment from someone claiming to be "shadow banned" here:








Like many "big blocker" arguments it is short on facts, contains no arguments, and is full of predictions and vague slurs.


How. What lies have I been told?


They can't. They can make a version of Bitcoin with different rules and hope people follow them. That's adding, not taking away.


I don't see any perversion. Bitcoin needs to stay as decentalized as possible. Allowing miners to decide on the blocksize is dangerous. Without decentralization we may as well all go back to using PayPal.


"Core" is the name of the software project which develops the predominant Bitcoin client. Over 100 contributors worked together to build the most recent release, which makes multiple improvements to the client in many areas. If Ver and his cronies weren't deliberately holding up the activation of a malleability fix we would be well on the road to a proper scaling solution rather than a dangerous temporary fix as proposed by BU.


That reads like nonsense. What is distributed vision? What is "outside money"? Is it possible to invest inside money? Do you have something against the idea of profit?


If there is a hard fork I will temporarily hold some "BUM" (Bitcoin Unlimited Miner) as well. I will sell it and buy more Bitcoin with the proceeds.


Do you have any evidence for these predictions? From what I've seen there's very little support for BU.

Blocks up to 32M were valid in the first release. Since then there have been several soft forks, adding new rules, but no hard forks, removing old rules.

Yes. A soft fork means that only miners need to upgrade to stay on the new fork. Non-mining nodes need not upgrade. A hard fork requires both users and miners to upgrade to stay on the new fork.

Except that that's not true.
Exchange transactions have always been offchain, because nobody wants to wait an average 10 minutes for each trade to complete. Betting on satoshidice with its on-chain transactions was slow and tedious. They were often defrauded by double-spend attacks. Off-chain betting is much faster and more efficient. Coinbase allow instant peer to peer transactions because they are instant, and don't require waiting for a confirmation. 
Bigger blocks wouldn't help with any of these use cases.
Jihan's point appears to be "if we fix malleability we might lose some fees". It isn't a very good point, and even if it was the appropriate answer is "oh well".

No consensus rule once made has ever been removed. New rules are periodically added (we call this a soft fork) but they are never removed.
Removing an existing rule creates a hard fork, which creates a consensus-breaking altcoin.

I think the problem is that (roughly speaking) going from 1MB to 2MB doubles the bandwidth requirements, and SegWit also doubles the bandwidth requirements.
Miners have said they're OK with doubling the bandwidth requirements, so either 2MB or SW are OK, but not both.
They are two independent ways of roughly doubling capacity (and hence bandwidth).

No, you're using a layer on top of Bitcoin. It's a centralised layer, where you have the trust that they won't steal your coins or lock your account, but it's a layer on top of Bitcoin and is one of the ways Bitcoin can scale. Coinbase uses Bitcoin as a settlement layer.

It's not hard to get access to your wallet if you don't know what you're doing. People get viruses, keyloggers, and all kinds of malware that can have access to their wallet.


If you're using an online wallet like Coinbase, you're not holding any bitcoins at all. Coinbase are holding them for you. Coinbase could steal or confiscate them. Coinbase could get hacked. A Coinbase employee could adjust your account balance downwards and their own balance upwards. It's much like using any other currency at that point. You've given up the "be your own bank" advantage of using Bitcoin by trusting Coinbase to look after your coins for you. Even if Coinbase don't mess up in any way, you still need to worry about malware reading your password as you type it.
The worry, basically, is that Bitcoin transactions are not reversible, and people are generally no good at securing their computer.

You appeared to be implying that miners could also increase the blocksize limit which isn't the case.
Reducing the block size limit is a soft fork which can be enforced by miners alone. Increasing the block size limit is a hard fork which cannot be done without support from the economic majority.

The blocksize limit is already in the consensus rules. What could be easier than that? Having each miner decide on their own value for the blocksize limit and hoping it doesn't result in a multitude of incompatible forks? Doubtful.
Of course the BU people would like it if some competent developers helped them with their mess. Not going to happen though.
The vast majority of Bitcoin nodes support SegWit. A few miners seem to be wanting to leave Bitcoin and work for the new BU chain instead. That's OK - it just means a bigger share of the blocks for the miners who stick with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:59:58


Interesting thought experiment, but not possible.
All direct descendants of the genesis block have the same "amount of POW".
The work contributed by a block is a function of the difficulty at that time, which is defined by the parent block. So all "block ones" represent the same amount of work.

Right, the CLAM source code is a fork (of a fork ... of a fork) of Bitcoin's source code, but the CLAM blockchain is not a fork of Bitcoin's blockchain.
A bunch of CLAMs were mined before public release, and then they were (pretty much manually) given to existing owners of BTC, LTC, and DOGE addresses. Each address got the same number of CLAMs.
Using a fork of the actual BTC chain would result in all BTC holders getting the same number of CLAMs as they had BTC, which apparently wasn't what the CLAM creators wanted.


184,583 of 3,208,032 sets of 4.60545574 CLAM were dug up so far from the initial distribution
That's about 5.75% of all funded addresses.


It's more hassle than not doing it, sure. It also requires giving your BTC private keys to the CLAM wallet which is understandably something people would be wary of doing. Though if you have an old empty Bitcoin wallet there's not much to lose by importing it into the CLAM client to see how many addresses in it have $4 worth of CLAM on them.

Fixing malleability enables the [Lightning Network]( to work very well, allowing off-chain transactions featuring instant confirmation, micropayments, very low fees, etc. Without a malleability fix there are complications.
Specifically, fixing malleability would allow us to create sequences of unconfirmed transactions safely. Currently if I create tx1 with txid1 and tx2 which spends one of the outputs of tx1, tx2 refers to the output of tx1 by tx1's txid. Due to the malleability bug it is possible that tx1 will confirm with a different txid, txid1b. This would make tx2 impossible to confirm since it explicity references txid1 which doesn't exist.

Sure it can. Change the start date to 'right now' on your node, and check that it rejects blocks that don't signal for segwit, and that it accepts blocks that do.
You'll end up on a fork of the chain as soon as you see a block that doesn't signal for segwit. So switch back to a regular Core client to get back onto the longest chain, and try again. Make sure that the UASF is accepting and rejecting the blocks it should.

The companies are saying that they will stick with the Bitcoin consensus rules rather than switching to some crappy altcoin's consensus rules.
I applaud them for that.
You may be operating under the mistaken belief that the miners are meant to reach consensus on which rules to follow. They aren't. The only thing miners reach consensus on is which version of the Bitcoin blockchain to build on top of. When the chain naturally forks, as it does several times each day, the miners get to pick which side of the fork to follow. If a fork happens which breaks the rules Bitcoin miners will automatically stay with the branch which follows the Bitcoin rules and will ignore the invalid branch.

Roger Ver once made a post about how one of his high-value transactions was stuck without confirmations. He made a big fuss about how this was caused by the 1MB blocksize limit.
It turned out in the end that the problem was caused entirely by transaction malleability. One of the inputs to his transaction had been malleated causing the high value transaction to beome invalid.
So not only would increasing the blocksize not have helped in that case, but SegWit *would* have helped him if he had been able to opt in to using it.
I pointed this out to him, but he continues to lie about it, using this large transaction of his as an example of why we need bigger blocks.

It was a soft fork.
A new rule was introduced that the sum of the outputs of a transaction really had to be smaller than the sum of the inputs, even if that sum caused an integer overflow. Previously only the least significant 64 bits of the sum of the outputs were considered.
A hard fork would imply that an existing rule was relaxed rather than a new rule being added.

I'm sorry, but I didn't understand what he was trying to say. I see he has corrected his post now.
He's right. Changing the POW algorithm would be a bad thing. Making an altcoin with a bigger blocksize limit wouldn't affect Bitcoin significantly. There are already over 1000 altcoins. One more won't make a difference.
The choice is between changing the POW algorithm to defend against a 51% attack on the Bitcoin blockchain and *not* doing so. If miners are 51% attacking the Bitcoin chain and making it impossible for users to get their transactions confirmed then changing the POW algorithm would become necessary. Bad, but better than doing nothing.

That isn't what happened. Talk of alternative clients is absolutely fine.

There are many ways. Maybe the attacker phoned Finex's hosting company and somehow convinced them to reset the password to the hosting account. Maybe the attacker works for the site's hosting company. Maybe there was a bug in the exchange software that allowed the attacker to get a copy of the site's hot wallet. And so on.
The 8 hours of trickling is presumably the attacker moving all the new deposits out of the wallet he was able to copy and into his own wallet. He's effectively stealing deposits as they happen. That's why Finex has asked customer to stop using old deposit addresses.

There's no point accepting blocks bigger than the network limit, because no valid blocks are bigger than the network limit.
And there's no point rejecting blocks smaller than the network limit, or you will find yourself on your own very inactive fork of the blockchain.
Why would you want such a useless option? Bitcoin is a consensus system and as such the nodes follow the consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:53:45


Have you seen BU? It advocates for letting miners decide on the Bitcoin consensus rules rather than having to follow the existing rules. The people behind BU either don't have Bitcoin's best interests at heart or aren't very bright.
Miners work for us, not the other way around. If they don't want to follow the rules they don't get paid.

@_date: 2016-03-12 18:58:19


Not true. If you have 50% of the hashpower and are working on a separate chain, you will generate 24 hours worth of blocks every 24 hours. You will be creating blocks at the same rate as the other 50% of the hashpower that's working on the 'valid' chain.
You seem to be thinking that a 51% attack is where the bad guy has 51% and the good guys have the other 100% making a total of 151%. That's not how percentages work. Either that or you think the bad guy is going to try to fork the chain from 24h ago and then struggle to catch up. He's not. He's going to start "right now", and build his fork in private for 24h before announcing it and having all the idiot Classic nodes accept it "because old is good no need to check" or whatever.
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:51:31
The choice of who gets to stake the next block is random in the same way that Bitcoin's choice of who gets to mine the next block is random. It's about having an output that gets a low-enough hash when combined with a bunch of stuff.
This bunch of stuff you combine your output with depends on things you don't know in advance, like a regularly changing stake modifier.

I'm not claiming anyone is crazy, and "no matter what" is probably an overstatement. But I think he has made it pretty clear that he is willing to have Bitcoin lose all the features which make interesting just so long as it gains mass adoption. That stance doesn't require insanity. There are other possible explanations. Maybe he's not very smart. Maybe he's being paid to take that stance. Or threatened in some way. Maybe he has other incentives that we don't know about. Perhaps he has a large short position in Bitcoin or a large long Ethereum position. I don't know or care - it really doesn't matter why he is taking the position he is taking. But insanity certainly isn't a requirement.
All we know is that he has stated that he recognizes the risks of pushing in the direction he's pushing, and is willing to accept those risks.


 
That makes him the enemy as I see it. That is not "a risk worth taking" especially when we have better options available which he is actively blocking.

They set the usual high (95%) requirement for activation to make sure it won't activate if it isn't overwhelmingly popular. It's impossible to reach such a level of support while a few large mining pools oppose SegWit for their own selfish reasons. Perhaps if those pools stopped working on the Bitcoin chain and switched to the BU chain it would be easier to gain consensus among the remaining miners.


I think this is a reaction to the tides of abuse they receive on Have you taken a look there recently? It's full of ridiculous conspiracy theories and just the worst abuses of logic. I agree it's not a good idea to spend so much time arguing with the trolls (hmmm) but it's hard not to sometimes.

Whenever the sum of the prices is less than 1 BTC, you can profit, using the technique I outlined.

@_date: 2017-03-31 06:24:14


That's not entirely fair. It is not inconceivable that there's some detail which you've missed. Maybe there's a lock which needs to be obtained before rejecting a block. Maybe there's some issue with how the multi-threading works that means we shouldn't be rejecting a block from that part of the function.
I don't know the codebase well enough to be sure that there isn't some kind of a gotcha of that class waiting to jump out, and from what you've said neither do you, since you're apparently quite new to the Bitcoin Core source code. It would certainly be helpful to have a code review from someone who is intimately familiar with the code.

Bitcoin was designed to allow layers on top of it. That's why we have flexible scripting built into transactions. Satoshi talked about payment channels.
The marginal cost of production isn't related to the amount being transacted. What do you mean when you ask about the "optimum transaction fee subsidy" as a percentage? A percentage of what?
Eventually the block reward drops to zero, and so the fee is 100% of the miners' income. Are you arguing for eternal money supply inflation? You're ahead of the plan. First remove the blocksize limit and work on the 21 million coin supply after.

You shouldn't be moving wallet.dat files around while the client is still running, that can damage them.

Me neither. Leave control of the protocol with the people using Bitcoin. Don't give it up to powerful mining interests.


This is nothing to do with "core". This is a hostile takeover attempt which should be resisted. There are multiple Bitcoin node implementations all following the consensus rules.

Having an option which allowed your node to set its own maximum blocksize would result in different users ending up on different chains. It wouldn't help reach consensus on a new limit, it would just cause a whole lot of chain splits.

It is obviously impossible for everybody to hold a full copy of everybody's transactions. A billion people each making one transaction per month would require the billion people to each store 12 billion transactions. That's a total of 12 billion billion transactions needing to be stored per year, and clearly isn't sensible. It is so clear to me that the only way to scale this thing is a sensible way it to have the vast majority of transactions be off-chain.

Maybe. A few weeks ago a BU node mined an illegal block. It was accidentally over a million bytes long.
It is unclear how many remaining consensus breaking bugs remain in BU.
The Bitcoin chain will survive. If the death of the Bitcoin chain is a prerequisite for the creation of a BU chain then it won't ever happen, and so BU serves no purpose.

A soft fork needs majority hashrate to work. If the economic majority support the soft fork it should gain a majority of the hashrate since the alternative is mining a coin with very little value.

I don't know, and it shouldn't matter who I am or what I did. I don't like the appeal to authority.
Personally I support SegWit and am on the fence about UASF, but that shouldn't matter either. I am not trying to FUD. I am trying to point out that a newbie's code review isn't as convincing as that of someone with a good knowledge of the codebase. That is all.
Oh, except that [in this comment]( I pointed out a factual error in his walkthrough, and he didn't take that well either. It seems like there's a lot of ego tied up in this post.

I'm unaware of any easy way to use payment channels for day to day Bitcoin transactions at the moment. The few uses of payment channels I've seen have been very specific.
Lightning will allow cheap trustless instant peer-to-peer transactions with anyone who uses Lightning and who is connected to you via any number of intermediaries. We've not seen anything like that before. Once it is built into the wallets that people use it will be used very widely.


The point is that you don't need to trust anyone. You can unilaterally close the channel at any time and get your coins back.

I do mean the chain with the most work. It is possible that most hashrate will work on the UASF chain if that's what the economic majority of nodes is looking at. Miners want to be able to sell their coins. If the exchange they sell their coins on is only using the UASF branch, that's where they'll need to mine. If the exchange is using both branches then the miners will want to mine on whichever branch has the more valuable coins.


Sure. By "longest chain" I meant "chain with the most cumulative work on it".


Can you explain how it isn't a soft fork even if the majority of miners refuse to signal for SegWit? No rules were removed, so it isn't a hard fork.

Yes, it would. I didn't say there couldn't be a split. I said it wouldn't be a hard fork.
Lowering the probability of such a split is why historically we have waited for 95% agreement before initiating a soft fork.

[Here's a demo]( of one Lightning implementation, Eclair. It shows the recipient generating a payment request, sending it to the sender, and the sender using it to make the payment.
It doesn't appear to use BTC addresses. There's no reason you wouldn't have multiple channels open using the same BTC address for instance (other than the usual reasons for not reusing addresses of course).

The blocksize limit isn't in the hands of developers. It is in the consensus rules of Bitcoin. The developers cannot change it without splitting the chain any more than anyone else can. This "omg devs are in control" myth isn't helpful. "Core" isn't in control. They write software which people use or don't use.
What BU does is put an important parameter into the hands of the miners. That is wrong and dangerous.


In that case BU gives us nothing of value. Since its sole value proposition is that it lets miners increase the blocksize limit.
Miners don't get to vote on anything other than which transactions to put into their 1 MB blocks, and in which order. If they think we are asking them to vote on the consensus rules they are sadly mistaken.

There are currently 16,197,437.5
The limit is reached asymptotically. The first 4 years produced half of the total supply: 11.5 million BTC. The next 4 years produced another quarter of the total supply: 5.75 million BTC. We're in the third 4 years and a producing another eighth of the total supply: 2.875 million BTC.
Following blocks of 4 years will produce 1/16th, 1/32th, 1/64th, etc. of the total supply. This continues for another hundred years, but really over 77% of all Bitcoins have already been created.

I've tried to figure out where Roger is coming from, but can't find a position that doesn't rely on him being either stupid, malicious, or compromised. I keep seeing him repeating statements which he knows to be false, and I keep seeing him refusing to take new facts on board when people with a clue attempt to help him see where he's wrong.
Roger is on record stating that he doesn't care if Bitcoin becomes nothing more than a [PayPal clone]( so long as it stays cheap and available. That's pretty close to a "no matter what" isn't it?

Johnny consistently mispronounces "throughput" as if it was written "th**o**roughput".
"Throughput" is a measure of how much you can put *through* a system. It isn't related to being *thorough*.
* through /THro͞o/: moving in one side and out of the other side of (an opening, channel, or location).
* thor·ough /ˈTHərō/: complete with regard to every detail; not superficial or partial.

The last time I looked at their voting site the most popular proposal was "give total control to coinbase" or something like that.
Presumably somebody was demonstrating how such votes can be gamed. The 'solution' appears to be requiring people to upload personally identifying information before they can get 'verified'. As if that somehow prevents vote rigging. The whole idea is fundamentally flawed.

Yes, it would be incredibly inefficient to store every little purchase on the blockchain and would make it impossible for most people to even consider running a full node. Fortunately there is a limit to the size of Bitcoin blocks, so there is only room for a limited number of transactions per block.
How do we decide which transactions are "important" enough to get to be on the blockchain? We allow everyone to pay a voluntary fee to prioritize their transaction. Those who pay the biggest fees get to have their transactions confirmed.
There will inevitably be some transactions which aren't able or willing to pay a big enough fee to get into a block. For those there will be other options, like using a payment channel, some off-chain mechanism, or maybe even using an altcoin with bigger blocks.

The longer chain wouldn't be following the Bitcoin consensus rules and so wouldn't be Bitcoin.
Have you seen how long the dogecoin chain is? It's REALLY long. Those guys mine a block every minute, and no fucks are given.

Yes. You can then use your 20k USD to buy 25 BCC, which leaves you with 125 BCC.
Then when the chain forks, or at the end of the year (whichever comes first) you get 125 BTC (and no BTU). You have effectively sold the "Unlimited" part of your coins for extra "Core" coins.
If Unlimited ends up killing Core, you lose everything (well, you still have 125 BTC, but they're worthless).
If Unlimited dies (as, of course, it will) you have gained 25 BTC.

You would install Bitcoin Core, import the privkey (without recanning) and use the debug console to:
    createrawtransaction ...
    signrawtransaction ...
    sendrawtransaction ...
I can do into details if you like, but as you say your transaction will probably never confirm so it's kind of a waste of time.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:22:46
Yes, that's a possibility too.
More importantly I think they should define what they mean by a BU chain. What if there's some other project, "Bitcoin Unlovely" or something which is very similar but coded by someone even less competent, and that one happens to be the one that forks the chain? Does that count?
Maybe any chain which has a block bigger than 1 million bytes in it counts as a BU chain.
But what if some new BU+segwit fork happens? Is it still BU if it supports segwit?
They really need to define the terms.

Miners vote for which transactions they want to confirm, and in which order. Nothing more.

~~The current market price seems to be about 2 or 3 BTC to 1 BTU, so you're unlikely to get 4:1 from anyone.~~ See  and  for the bitfinex markets.
Edit: I got that backwards. The market price is 1 BTC buys 2 BTU. Greg's offer is probably also getting it backwards ("*goad him into a 4 (BTC) : 1 (BTU) trade*") - 4 BTC should get you 8 to 12 BTU, not just 1 of them.
OP is offering a really good deal relative to the market prices. Roger should snap the deal up immediately. Unless of course he doesn't really believe in BU and has some (not very well) hidden agenda.

It was buggy and untested. My pull request fixed a bug. That's not FUD, just stating facts.
The UASF repository really was just a copy/paste from the original BIP148, which itself had a bug in the reference implementation code. That's also not FUD. Bugs exist until they get fixed. The trick is not to make non-testing releases until code is reviewed and tested.

The main problem with on-chain scaling is that it is impossible for the kind of volume we want to be able to support. In that sense it is not a solution at all. While there are still lots of optimizations possible to enable us to scale on-chain (more efficient signature schemes for example, such as Schnorr) they can only get us so far.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:19:35


That much seems pretty clear, yes.


What do you propose we do to eliminate the threat? If a majority of miners decide to start mining an altcoin, we can't stop them. If a majority of miners decide to orphan our blocks and replace them with empty blocks in an attempt to cripple our coin, what can we do other than change the proof of work algorithm to protect ourselves?


The miners seem to be realizing that they can't win this. There is no support for the altcoin they are proposing. They will be forced to decide between mining Bitcoin or mining a worthless altcoin. And they are beginning to recognize that if they pick the altcoin they may never be able to come back to Bitcoin because the work algorithm could have changed rendering their hardware useless for anything other than mining the shitcoin they temporarily supported.


Maybe. Hopefully the miners will come to their senses and compromise. They aren't in a good position if they don't.

BU serves as a counterexample. There's no large group of developers writing or testing code for it.


BU was presumably developed by developers who *were* willing to create that code.
What I'm saying is that the consensus rules don't have anything to do with developers. Develops can be employed, just as miners can be. If you pay someone enough they'll develop the feature you want, or mine on whichever altcoin's chain you want.

It is possible for the government to order you to do something and also order you not to tell anyone that they have done so. A warrant canary is when you regularly publish a statement saying that you are under no such order. If you stop publishing the statement then it is safe to assume that you *are* under such an order without you explicitly having to say so.
I don't see how this applies to Gavin. He is acting as if he has been compromised by some enemy of Bitcoin, but I don't see how the "warrant canary" concept applies.

You can use CAPITALS as much as you like. It doesn't make your point any more correct however.
Miners get paid in Bitcoins for mining blocks which follow the Bitcoin consensus rules. They work for us, and we pay them for that work.
If they stop following the Bitcoin consensus rules and mine blocks which break those rules, we don't pay them. Maybe the BU guys will pay them in BU coins. That's up to the BU coins. Maybe Roger will pay them. I don't care.

I checked your link, and was curious:
    elkrem is a simpler alternative to the 64 dimensional sha-chain.
    it's basically a reverse merkle tree
Why pick a binary tree like this over the 64 dimensional chain? The 64 dimensional chain branches more than the elkrem tree, and so the average number of hashes you need to do to get to a random node is smaller.
Comparing the two, we see that elkrem is densest at the bottom, while the n-dimensional tree is densest in the middle. For a random number in a tree with 2^k nodes in it, we expect to have to do k-2 hashes for elkrem and k/2 hashes for the n-dimensional chain.
I tried drawing the two structures out, to get an idea of how they look:
        elkrem                                                                 31         (1)

In the n-dimensional tree the depth `h` is always equal to the number of zeroes in the binary representation of the index `i`.
Edit2: For your elkrem tree, you can calculate `h` from `i` by doing something like this, in O(h) time (excuse the language, I don't know Go):
    function height(i) {
        var rows = 5;
        for (var h = rows; h &gt; 0; h--) {
            var pow = Math.pow(2, h) - 1;
            while (i &gt;= pow) {
                i -= pow;
                if (i === 0)
                    return h - 1;
            }

That's incorrect.
The broken condition was:

    VERSIONBITS_TOP_MASK is 0xE0000000
    VERSIONBITS_TOP_BITS is 0x20000000
    VersionBitsMask(chainparams.GetConsensus(), Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_SEGWIT) is 2
so the condition is equivalent to:
    !((pindex-&gt;nVersion &amp; 0xE0000000) == 0x20000000) &amp;&amp; (pindex-&gt;nVersion &amp; 2) != 0
    (pindex-&gt;nVersion &amp; 0xE0000000) != 0x20000000 &amp;&amp; (pindex-&gt;nVersion &amp; 2) != 0
That is satisfied whenever `nVersion` is `2`, which an attacking miner could easily set it to be.

Miners do get the transaction fee from all the transactions they include in their block, but they also get a new 12.5 BTC as well, created out of thin air.
Currently transaction fees are around 1 BTC per block, so miners get 13.5 BTC per block - 1 BTC from the fees, and 12.5 newly created BTC.
If you look at any recent block you'll see the first transaction in the block has no inputs, and outputs totaling somewhere around 13 or 14 BTC. That's the miner getting paid.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:48:27

That's right.
What this change does is vastly increases the damage that can be done by a 51% attacker.
Currently a 51% attacker can rewrite the chain to block your transactions from being mined, and can collect all the block rewards for himself. He can't steal any of my coins.
After the proposed chain, a 51% attacker can spend any coins he wants to, whether he has their private key or not.
I don't see how this is a good change to make, unless you want to weaken Bitcoin.

That's not how it works.
While the transaction is unconfirmed the coins are still in A's wallet. A can send the same coins to C, D, and E. Whichever transaction confirms (and only one of them can) will move the coins to that particular recipient.
When the transaction confirms, the coins are in B's wallet. There's no "sending back".

The fee shouldn't be a percentage of the amount transacted since the amount transacted has no bearing on the cost of the transaction to the network.
The fee should be a function of the amount of space it the transaction takes up on the blockchain. Ideally most transactions would be off-chain and so have very low fees.

No, it's spelling out the danger of labeling all hard forks as being equally bad. In reality contentious hard forks are worse than those with broad consensus. Hard forks which give control of the blocksize limit to the miners are worse than those which don't. Hard forks to badly written buggy code are worse than those which use well written well reviewed well tested code. And so on.

There are many different Bitcoin node implementations. They all follow the same set of consensus rules.
BU is not one of them. It follows a different set of rules, and will accept blocks that are greater than a million bytes long.

* you ask him to prove he owns 500 BTC
* he shows you the signature from this thread
* you check that it verifies and so believe he has 500 BTC; he doesn't
* you give him a bunch of USD
* he vanishes
Sure you could ask for a more specific signed message and he wouldn't be able to give it to you. But I worry that a lot of people wouldn't be aware enough of the risk involved.

The set of all transactions is a superset of the set of all free transactions.
If you include *all* transactions you are by definition including all *free* transactions. Anyone running an archive node will need to store all this free junk forever which simply isn't a workable situation to be in.
Letting the miners decide would be kind of OK if it was the miners paying for the consequence of their decision, but they don't. All full nodes pay for the miners' decisions. That's why we don't let them make these decisions.

Suppose you have `x` BTC in 1 single address, and the probability of the attacker finding the key for that address in their brute force search is `p`. Then your expected loss to that attacker is `p.x`
If you split your coins into `n` piles of `x/n`, there are `n` times more private keys for the attacker to find, so there is an `n` times greater probability that he will find one of them.
Your expected loss to the attacker is `n.p * x/n` = `p.x`, the same as before.
You have increased the risk of theft while reducing the variance, all while keeping the expected loss the same.

There are two concepts:
1. A block which signals that it is ready for SegWit
2. A block which actually segregates witnesses into a separate area


It depends what you mean by "segwit block":
Blocks of type 1 are being mined and accepted today.
Blocks of type 2 could be mined today and would be accepted (since SegWit is a soft fork) but they wouldn't be interpreted correctly. The witnesses would be ignored, since SegWit isn't active yet.


BIP148 is all about how to handle blocks of type 1. It says when we are in the specified date range, if SegWit isn't already activated then reject all blocks which don't signal for SegWit (ie. blocks which aren't of type 1).
So what happens when BIP48's start date is reached and a block that signals for SegWit is mined is that the block is accepted as normal. Nothing changes. But when the start date is reached and a block doesn't signal for SegWit, it is rejected by BIP148 nodes.
After a whole 2016 block period with 95% of blocks accepting SegWit blocks, activation is locked in. Once it is locked in, we no longer care whether blocks signal for SegWit any more. The code is only ever rejecting blocks if SegWit isn't already active. It should possibly stop rejecting blocks as soon as SegWit is locked in rather than waiting the extra 2016 blocks for activation. Once it is activated we will accept blocks which don't signal for SegWit, so why not also accept them which SegWit is in the LOCKED_IN state?

The attack I'm describing is the one [Gavin came up with recently]( in which the majority of miners have switched to mining BU but occasionally switch back to Bitcoin to mine a chain of empty blocks which reorgs and orphans all the recent Bitcoin blocks.
Doing so earns them all the Bitcoin block rewards, causes the honest Bitcoin miners to lose all their income, and prevents Bitcoin users from ever getting a transaction confirmed.
In the face of such an attack Bitcoin miners aren't going to keep mining since they're not being paid for it. As they turn off their miners it becomes increasingly easy for the BU miners to attack the Bitcoin chain.
So I guess I don't understand your "time is on our side" comment. I looks like the opposite to me if we don't defend ourselves against such an attack. ([Maybe with a soft fork?](

The UASF results in two chains. If 50% of the hashrate supports the UASF and 50% doesn't it's going to be hard to know which chain is the "right" one.

Historically this has happened each time there has been a soft fork. New rules were added. No rule has ever been removed. BU is proposing the removal of the "no more than a million bytes per block" rule. Removing an existing rule like that would be called a hard fork, and inevitably creates a new coin. cf. the ETH/ETC hard fork.


I'm saying there's only one set of Bitcoin consensus rules. Dogecoin nodes follow Dogecoin consensus rules, and BU nodes follow BU consensus rules.
To the extent that BU nodes accept blocks bigger than 1e6 bytes in size they are not Bitcoin nodes.

Of course it has something to do with the block size debate.
Coinbase are actively campaigning to get the blocksize limit doubled, while at the same time using more than twice as much space per block as they need to. It's possible to bundle withdrawals up into a single transaction, using less than one transaction per withdrawal.
Rather than trying to double the cost to run a node for everyone (thereby externalizing the cost of their wastefulness) they should stop being so wasteful. Then maybe we wouldn't be running out of space.

Actually it's fine for storing money. You only have problems if you generate more new addresses than are in your backup. New addresses are generated in two cases:
1) when you ask for a new receiving address
2) when you make an outgoing transaction - a new address is used for the change
You can put "keypool=1000" in your bitcoin.conf to have the wallet.dat pre-allocate 1000 addresses instead of the default 100, meaning you need to refresh your backup 10 times less often.

So the only thing enforcing them is everything? OK. Almost nobody agrees with the new BU rules. That is why the BU and Classic forks will fail.
Even the 'Classic' guy just admitted that this whole debate isn't about faster or cheaper transactions. It's about handing control over to his miner friends.


That's a false dichotomy. The choice is between Bitcoin and BU, not between Core and BU. Core is just one Bitcoin software project. There are many more compatible codebases. BU is different than all of them in that it doesn't implement the correct consensus rules.

Segwit fixes a lot of bugs and clears the way for massive off-chain scaling.
BU fixes nothing, introduces new bugs, causes multiple hard forks, and allows the miners to increase the blocksize limit to whatever they want it to be, driving smaller miners and independent full nodes off the network.
Why is BU better than SegWit (or even better than the current situation) in your own words?
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:28:51


True, but the extra DOS protection code needed when you raise the blocksize limit is the same as the that needed when you raise the effective blocksize limit by deploying SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:10:22


What is "Dev consensus"? This is nothing to do with developers. People are free to write whatever code they want, and the users will decide which code to run. Bitcoin Core doesn't have any special powers or rights here. It just happens to be the most popular implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. There are many others. Most of them agree about the consensus rules. A few don't.


They shouldn't be, and they aren't.


I don't know how you come to that conclusion. Are the holdings of each developer public knowledge? What about the holdings of each user or miner?


No, probably some would go along with it without really wanting to, you're right. I don't think it needs to be the case that everyone who is ready for it actually wants it. There are certainly more businesses ready for SegWit than there are for a hard-fork that forks and bloats the chain.


In what sense is it the default? It is certainly the most popular, has the most developers working on it, has the best testing and code review, and a proven track history. Does that make it unfair like your election example? I don't see why.

I wrote a reply to the parent comment from but I couldn't post it because the comment was deleted. So I'll post here instead.










Each input adds about 150 bytes to the transaction size. If you're paying 100 satoshis per byte and BTC is at $1250 then each extra input is going to add about 19 cents to the fee:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 150 * 0.00000100 * 1250
    0.1875
You could add 19 cents to the price of your products to cover the fee you will incur when moving the payment. Or ignore it, since it's less than 0.7% of your average order price.
$11 seems like a lot to move $600 worth of inputs if they average $30 each. That's just 20 inputs, and so should cost around $4 if they're 19 cents each. I would hazard a guess that you have a lot of smaller inputs, and that the average size is way less than $30.
In the long term hopefully we will start using Schnorr signatures, which [would also allow creating one signature for each transaction no matter how many inputs it has]( greatly reducing the size of the kind of transaction we're talking about here.

The other issue is that if there isn't a fork then the BU supporter loses.
The terms of the exchange proposed in this thread are entirely unclear, but I suspect that if no fork happens then no trade happens, and so the BU supporter breaks even.
That would explain why the rate of exchange is worse for the BU supporter here than on BitFixex - because the terms are better.

Then fear not. It is a soft fork, not a hard fork.
It would cause a split chain if a minority of miners support the UASF, but only until the rest of the miners switch over. A hard fork is where old clients get left behind. That never happens here.

When it was introduced there wasn't much of a spam problem, so it wasn't actually needed at the time. Today there is. Satoshi was thinking forward to a time when we needed the protection of a blocksize limit.
The demand for permanent distributed free storage is effectively infinite. It's not a bug that we don't allow unlimited amounts of spam onto all our hard drives forever.


Not as far as old nodes are concerned. They won't see the witness data at all. As far as new nodes are concerned, they will need to download the block plus the witness data if they want to validate the signatures, but they can choose to only download the 1 MB blocks if they know the signatures are OK (because for example they already checked them on another node they're running).

That's a poor definition. There's no way in general to know which source code produced which chain. And it's likely that multiple different clients would produce different parts of the chain too.
Better would be to define properties of the chain itself ("at least one block over a million bytes", for example).

Pretty good writeup. One thing was unclear I think:

Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but yes, that's what happened. When you reimplement something and want to make sure you have it right, you run a whole barrage of tests comparing the output of your new implementation with the output of the original version. Whenever the two produce different output you try to find out why.
Usually the new implementation will have a bug in it, so you fix it and re-run the tests. In this case the new implementation was getting the right result but OpenSSL was getting the wrong result, and so they found a bug in OpenSSL accidentally, while testing the implementation of libsecp256k1.

Phil from BitFinex is pretty insistent that it is next to impossible to change a coin's ticket symbol. BTU won't become BTC. The price of the tokens has no effect on how the rules work.
BCC get converted to BTC if the BTU chain exists. Which is does.
BCU get converted to BTU if the BTU chain exists. Else they vanish.
If Unlimited eventually wins this battle then I expect people will start to call it "Bitcoin". The ticker symbol will still likely be BTU though.


There is an imbalance. Bitcoin "Core" has a blockchain, and billions of dollars of value. Bitcoin Unlimited is a small group of people attempting a hostile takeover.


Someone who wants BTU, because they think it will have value. Presumably if "Unlimited" ends up winning then the $200 you can currently buy BCU for is a bargain.

My biggest problem with it was the time jumps. I get it, the time between guesses doubles each time you get it wrong, so we're going back 4 months, then, 2 months, etc. But the timeline breaks down at that point. The next jump back should be 1 month, but that doesn't happen right.
Also, why doesn't he just make an image of his hard drive, firstly as a backup, and secondly so he can keep restoring it and not have to wait so long between password guesses. Or set the clock to a future date to defeat the wait time. Or modify the wallet software to remove the delay.

No, I don't see any analogy there.
Stake grinding works like this:
* we pick a block height far in the future when we want to mount a double-spend attack
* we check all of our outputs and see which ones can stake at our target time
* those that can't, we send to ourselves, and loop until they can stake around the target time
* when the target time arrives, we can stake 10 blocks in a row and rewrite the blockchain
This only works if you can know in advance which outputs are able to stake at which points in the future.
That apparently used to be the case in peercoin, but the stake modifier was introduced to make that impossible.
In contrast, card counting doesn't let you know which hands you will win, or guarantee that you can win 10 hands in a row. It just lets you know when your odds of winning a hand are higher than usual so you can increase your bet size.

If you send me a payment with zero fee, and I then use that unconfirmed transaction to make a new transaction of my own with a big fee, the miners are smart enough to realize that if they want to claim the big fee then they have to confirm *both* transactions, since the new one with the big fee depends on the old one with no fee.

2nd layer transactions already happen.
* When I send coins from my CoinBase account to someone else's CoinBase account it happens entirely offchain, and miners don't receive a transaction fee except for when I deposit and withdraw.
* When I place a bet on PrimeDice, the transaction happens entirely offchain in PrimeDice's database. Miners receive no fee except for when I deposit and withdraw.
* When I trade BTC on BitFinex, the transactions all happen entirely offchain in Finex's database. Miners receive no fee except for when I deposit and withdraw.
All of these cases require me to trust a third party. CoinBase, PrimeDice, BitFinex are all in a position to exit scam and take some of my coins for themselves.

The Bitcoin blockchain is the longest chain of blocks which obey the Bitcoin consensus rules.
The Dogecoin chain is longer, but doesn't count because it doesn't obey the Bitcoin consensus rules - it doesn't start from the correct genesis block, it creates too many new tokens per block, the difficulty targets 1 minute instead of 10 minutes, etc. Even if Dogecoin miners outnumbered Bitcoin miners ten to one, the Dogecoin blockchain still wouldn't be the Bitcoin blockchain.
Similarly, if Roger's BU chain gets longer than the Bitcoin blockchain it won't be the Bitcoin blockchain because it will contain blocks which break the 1 MB blocksize limit rule.


I don't know what that sentence means. How can a blockchain be a majority? A majority of what?


I don't think we're talking about sidechains here. But I don't see how creating a sidechain could be seen as attacking the main chain.


Deliberately orphaning blocks to kill a chain is clearly an attack. I fail to understand how you could possibly see it any other way.


They aren't. Changing the POW is a bad idea. It punishes honest miners who have invested in expensive hardware. But in the event that the majority of the hashrate becomes dishonest and attacks the Bitcoin blockchain I don't see any other reasonable course of action for us to defend ourselves.

You are misunderstanding the term consensus here. The consensus rules aren't rules which 100% of the people agree to be the best rules. The are rules which 100% of the people can blindly follow to come to agreement about which chain is the longest valid chain.
We reach consensus on *which transactions are confirmed* by following the rules. That is what miners are "voting" on with their hash rate. Miners get to decide which transactions are confirmed and which are not.

Traditional consensus is where miners decide which transactions to confirm, in which order, and the longest valid chain wins.

Consider two paper wallets both encrypted with a passphrase, both with 1 BTC on them.
You might think they are both worth the same to me, but they aren't.
I made one of them myself, and accepted the other one from you in payment for something.
The one I made myself I know is secure. Only I know the passphrase.
The one I got from you I am worried about. You also know the passphrase, and could empty it at any point *after* trading it to me.
These two 1 BTC paper wallets are not "fungible", since one of them has its private key known by two people, and one only has it known by one person. Paper wallets don't work well for cash, because assuming I could empty a paper wallet before I trade it with you, I could also empty it *after* I trade it with you.
The OpenDime removes this problem. The private key is not known by anyone, and so two 1 BTC OpenDimes are worth the same. ie. they are fungible, just like two $20 bills are fungible. I would happily trade one $20 bill for another (assuming I knew they weren't forgeries). Similarly I would trade one 1 BTC OpenDime for another.

BCC tokens cannot ever become BTU coins.
* BCC becomes BTC.
* BCU becomes BTU.
* That is all (replace the middle 'C' in the split token with a 'T' to get the real coin ticker symbol).

No, you're thinking of a hard fork such as would be happen if people started taking BU seriously.
The difference with a hard fork is that old rules are removed (such as the "no block can be over 1000000 bytes long). Then when a new node mines a block that breaks this removed rule the old clients refuse to accept that block, forking the chain.

SegWit is a malleability fix while giving heavy signature transactions a subsidy so that users are incentivized to reduce the UTXO size. Currently is it cheap to create dust outputs and expensive to clean them up. SegWit goes some way towards fixing that problem.
As for "pushing offchain transactions", how else do you think we are going to scale? By keeping every single transaction no matter how small on the blockchain of every full node for ever? That's just silly. We need offchain scaling.
SegWit is a blocksize increase, and LN transactions are Bitcoin transactions. Do you have an argument against either of those statements beyond "lol"?
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:20:07


The SF in UASF stands for "Soft Fork". It isn't a hard fork, it is a soft fork.
It is adding a new rule: "all blocks must signal for SegWit". That makes it a soft fork. A hard fork would be the removal of a rule, such as "all blocks must be one million bytes or less". Removing that (or any) consensus rule creates a hard fork.
If there is a hard fork, people who didn't update their client to a version that knows about the removal of a rule will be stuck on the original chain. They will never switch to the new chain even if it 'wins'.
With the UASF, people who didn't update their client to a version that knows about the addition of a rule will automatically find themselves on whichever chain is the longest. They don't need to upgrade to stay up to date with the longest valid chain.
Eventually they may hear about SegWit activating, how it allows cheaper transactions, access to Lightning, etc. and then they can choose to upgrade. But if they don't keep up with the news they are free to stay on their old client and everything will work as usual for them.
That is the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork. Hard forks require all users to upgrade their client while soft forks don't.

A while back when the network was being spammed with thousands of zero-fee transactions and nodes were dying due to mempool exhaustion there was advice going around about fixing the problem by putting
    minrelaytxfee=0.0001
in your bitcoin.conf. I guess a bunch of people did that. Now they refuse to relay any transactions which don't include a fee of at least that much per kB of transaction data. And Bitcoin Core defaults to paying less than that. So it's often the case that the nodes you are connected to will refuse to relay the transactions you send them.
tldr: yes, fee size can affect whether people see your transaction or not.

People don't.
The 51% attack that people worry about is where 51% of the miners orphan blocks from the rest of the network while still following the existing rules.
If 51% of the miners choose to stop mining Bitcoin and mine something incompatible with Bitcoin that's not a 51% attack. It's just a mass resignation. I'm sure the remaining 49% of miners will welcome the chance to earn twice as much Bitcoin until the 51% realize they have made a mistake.

I think OP's point is that you cannot "convert" CNY into BTC. All you can do is exchange it with someone else. The CNY doesn't become BTC, it just changes hands from one person to another.
From an individual person's point of view they have moved from CNY to BTC to USD. But from a global view some CNY has moved from one person to another, as has some BTC and some USD. There was no capital flight, just redistribution.
In order for me to move my CNY into BTC someone else must be willing to move their BTC into CNY, for a net "flight" of zero.

OK, I'm with you so far, but what use are the BCC tokens?
I would be holding a huge stash of BCC tokens that I couldn't withdraw unless I could sell them to a "greater fool" for "real money". Alternatively I'd have to buy some BCU tokens from an Unlimited bagholder, pushing the price of BCU up. I think it's better if this thing has a defined end point.

It's a good idea for any Bitcoin supporter who doesn't believe BU will be successful. You can sell the "BU" part of each of your BTC for 0.34 BTC and keep the "Core" part. Then when BU fails you get all your BTC back. You have multiplied your BTC holdings by 1.34
It's a good idea for people who believe BU will split before the end of the year and go on to be the dominant chain. They can sell the 'worthless' Core part of each BTC for a massive 0.66 BTC and get to keep the BU part. When the chain splits they end up with 1.66 BTU coins for each BTC they started off with, as well as 0.66 Core coins which they can presumably still get something for.
In other words it's a way of dumping the fork you don't believe in before the split ever happens.


Where are you seeing the market prices of which you speak? I'd be interested in looking at them.


He gets to buy BU coins 3 times cheaper than we get to buy Core coins (though it's only 2 times cheaper now - someone bought 2400 BU coins since I posted, pushing the price up) - but that's because the market values Core coins more highly - because most people don't buy into the BU hype.

Well OK then, we agree. There is a safe (soft fork) way to effectively double the blocksize while also fixing transaction malleability and a host of other problems, while pathing the way for future scalability improvements.

@_date: 2017-03-26 11:29:46
Yes, but you can't expect to make much if any profit that way.
Here's a snapshot of the current prices:
* BTC/USD	975.49
* BCC/USD	803.47
* BCC/BTC	0.81764
* BCU/USD	186.78
* BCU/BTC	0.19000
You can split 1 BTC into 1 BCC and 1 BCU, sell the BCC for $803, sell the BCU for $186, that's a total of $989. Then you can buy 1 BTC for $975 and have $14 left over as profit.
Alternatively you can do the split and sell both pieces directly for BTC: sell the BCC for 0.817 BTC and sell the BCU for 0.19 BTC for a total of 1.007 BTC. You've got your 1 BTC back, and made a profit of 0.007 BTC.
Bear in mind that these are just 'last' prices, and are moving all the time. It's quite possible that you lose on the trade rather than gain. Edit: I also didn't consider trading fees. BitFinex charges 0.2% or 0.1% per trade for low volume accounts depending on whether you are taking an existing order or putting a new order into the books.

But they are eventually reconciled on the blockchain, when I withdraw my coins from the third party site.
I deposit 10 BTC to PrimeDice, make a million bets, then withdraw the 7.5 BTC I have left back to my local wallet. There are two transactions on the blockchain even though I made a million bets.
Doing it the old on-chain way, like SatoshiDice used to do, there would be two transactions per bet, ie. 2 million transactions.
The distinction being made here is that it somehow matters whether the off-chain transactions are enforceable or not. My deposit to PrimeDice could be stolen at any instant. If they used LN instead, it couldn't be. Either way the miners are only getting 2 fees: one when I deposit, and one when I withdraw.

Not true. Today's chain can be validated by the initial version of the Bitcoin client. New rules have been added but none have been taken away.
Taking away the 1 MB blocksize limit would be the first hard fork, and would create an altcoin. It Bitcoin Unlimited Miners want to work on an altcoin they are free to do so, but they won't be working on Bitcoin. They should find a new name. I propose "Bitcoin Unlimited Miner Coin", or "bumcoin" for short.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:24:40
You choose whether to run Core or any other node that follows the consensus rules. Core has no power to tell you what to run.
Core cannot single-handedly stop a blocksize limit increase. You are free to mine a 2MB block any time you like. Anyone who wants to use your fork of the chain will do so. People make altcoins all the time, and Core does not stop them in any way.
You keep talking about force. What makes you think you are being forced to do anything? You signed up to use a coin with particular rules and now seem upset that you are expected to follow those rules. Are you "forced" to follow the rules? No. You are free to make your own coin with your own rules. But don't think you can "force" anyone else to use your coin.

You deposit 1 BTC to BitFinex. You ask them to split them for you. You end up with 1 BCC (bitcoin core token) and 1 BCU (bitcoin unlimited token).
There are markets where you can trade (BCC or BCU) for (BTC or USD):
If the chain eventually forks, your BCC become real coins on the Core chain and your BCU become real coins on the Unlimited chain.
If the chain doesn't fork before the end of the year, your BCC become real BTC but your BCU disappear into thin air.
So if you think the Bitcoin Core chain will die, and Bitcoin Unlimited will win, you deposit 1 BTC, split it into 1 BCC and 1 BCU, sell the 1 BCC for $800, and use that $800 to buy 4 BCU. Then when the chain splits you have 4 Bitcoin Unlimited coins and no Bitcoin Core coins. But if the chain doesn't split you end up with nothing.
It's a chance for people to put their money where their mouth is. BU supporters should be all over this, quadrupling their coins (since they prices above are real - Core is trading at $800 and Unlimited at $200). I wonder if they don't really exist?

It's a constant in all Bitcoin implementations, because it's a constant in the Bitcoin consensus rules.
Any node which treats it as a constant isn't a Bitcoin node.
I think you are misunderstanding how consensus works in Bitcoin, and what it is for.
The problem which Bitcoin mining solves is the Byzantine Generals Problem: without a centralized body how are we to know which transactions are confirmed and which aren't? The solution is to use proof of work. The longest chain gets to say which transactions are confirmed, and in which order. That's all consensus is used for.
The other parameters (number of new coins created per block, maximum size of each block, no double spends allowed, etc.) are not decided by the consensus process. They are fixed. The only thing miners get to decide is which transactions to include in their block, and in which order. They don't get to decide to arbitrarily change the constants.
You used the term "dev consensus" again without explaining it. I asked twice already what you mean by it. Consensus is the process by which we agree on which transactions are confirmed and which are not. That is not something the developers do (unless they are also miners).
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:00:58
It's unclear. It required widespread consensus to change the consensus rules and we currently have some large miners blocking the activation apparently due to a misunderstanding about the incentives involved.
Allowing cheap instant offchain transactions will speed the adoption of Bitcoin and lead to new all-time high BTC/USD prices. This is nothing but good news for miners if only they could see it, since there will still be huge demand for on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:31:49


Some people are attempting to increase the blocksize limit for Bitcoin blocks by removing the consensus rule that currently limits us to 1 million bytes per block.
A result of this is that Bitcoin nodes which don't upgrade to the new version of the software will continue to reject blocks over 1 million bytes long, while the new nodes will accept those blocks. That results in there being two incompatible blockchains. So your transactions could confirm on one chain but not on the other. There would be two different "Bitcoin" chains, and everyone would have to pick which one they consider the "real" one.
It would lead to widespread confusion and be very bad for the price of both coins.
@_date: 2019-03-02 02:25:32
There was a bug that allowed transactions to spend the same input twice in some situations. So you could take your 10 BTC utxo, spend it twice in the same tx and end up with 20 BTC. An inflation bug, allowing the supply of BTC to be arbitrarily inflated. It was fixed before it was exploited.

I think the math is wrong here. Suppose you initially bought in for x USD. When the price increased by over 400% the value of your coins will have gone up to over 5x USD. Then when you sell half of your coins you get over 2.5x USD for them.
That means the cost basis of your remaining coins is around -1.5x USD. ie. very negative, and not zero at all.
If they had only doubled in price and you sold half, *then* your cost basis would be zero. But you're saying they 5x'ed in price.

The Bitcoin network has to store all on-chain transactions forever. If you're not willing to pay for that then you have the option of using a payment channel or other off-chain transaction. I don't see a problem with that.
Decentralization isn't efficient, and it isn't cheap. It comes at a price. Pay the price, or give up on decentalization. Those seem to be your options here. There will always be some troll willing to pay $1 per transaction to fill up the blocks no matter how big they are. Do we keep increasing the blocksize indefinitely to try to bankrupt the trolls?

The important thing those people are missing is that it is the longest *valid* chain that matters. If there's a chain that is longest but awards the miners 100 BTC per block, or a chain that is longest but contains some 10 MB blocks, those chains are invalid even if they are longest.

If billions of transactions per hour won't fit on the Bitcoin chain they also won't fit on any other crypto-currency's chain, for the same reason. They will need to be mostly off-chain.


Everyone agrees that it's good if lots of transactions use Bitcoin. We disagree on the best way to do this. Small blockers think it's best to have the majority be off-chain, with occasional on-chain settlement. Big blockers prefer to have everything be on-chain so the miners can maximize their income.

What do you mean by "valid"?
I recently made a transaction for 1 BTC which is timelocked until 2 years from now. The idea is that if I die, the recipient of the transaction is able to claim his funds in 2 years. I have no intention of double-spending the inputs, so the transaction is most definitely "valid". It is also, of course, 0-conf.

If 100% of Bitcoin users stopped using Bitcoin and started using Dogecoin instead I would still say that Dogecoin was an altcoin. It doesn't become Bitcoin just because people start using it.
Similarly if everyone stops using Bitcoin and starts using Bitcoin Unlimited Miner Coin, that doesn't stop it being an altcoin if its blocks don't meet the requirements of being Bitcoin blocks.

[This BIP]( tells us that the seed is derived from the whole mnemonic, not just the non-checksum part of it. So if you switch out the last word with a different word that also satisfies the checksum rule you'll get a whole new (presumably empty) wallet.
Edit: to test this, go to  and compare the addresses you get for:
    leaf normal jump common update rapid chimney soda peasant rural corn add
    leaf normal jump common update rapid chimney soda peasant rural corn age
They're both valid sets of 12 words, with only the last word changed.

Rusty isn't right - it is possible for B to spend the coins to C before they confirm.
But it isn't possible for the B-&gt;C transaction to confirm before the A-&gt;B transaction.
Miners are smart enough to recognize that if they want to claim the fee for the B-&gt;C transaction then they need to confirm the A-&gt;B transaction first. They can both appear in the same block.
When I receive a payment with no fee I will often send the unconfirmed output to myself with a high fee so that miners will be incentivized to confirm the no-fee transaction for me. This is called "parent pays for child".

He's not suggesting that they are fraudulent. The point that he is making is that if you store your coins on Coinbase, or any exchange, then you aren't really holding any coins at all. The exchange is holding them, and all you have is a promise that they will send them to you if you ask them to. There have been many cases of exchanges "getting hacked" and consequently reneging on their promises.
The alternative to storing your coins on an exchange or other website is to run your own local Bitcoin wallet software. That way you have control of your private keys and don't have to trust Coinbase or anyone else not to steal your coins. This is what he meant by "real Bitcoin wallets". I'm sure Coinbase use a "real" wallet too, but they control the private keys, and so they control the coins.

You know, even if we did come up with some kind of foolproof way to make sure that you can't cheat, the game would still be unfair, with the odds tipped in your favour.
See, even if I know that there's no way you can tell how much I've bet before you decide how much to bet yourself, you don't have to worry about the honest of the site operator (because you're him). Everyone except you has to include the risk of the site just refusing to pay out at some point, which means everyone except you has a reason to bet a little smaller than they otherwise would, to reduce that risk.
To get rid of that factor we're going to have to use some kind of 'smart contract', such that there's no way you (the site) can refuse to pay out the winner. Maybe something similar to how the Lightning Network Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) transactions work.

To be fair they only said "up to 97%" of their coins were in cold storage. That means "97% or less". They could have 0% of their in cold storage and still be able to truthfully claim that "up to 97%" of their coins were in cold storage.
The phrasing was also vague. Saying that they are stored with "multisig and AES" could mean that some are multi-sig and some are AES, not that all are both.
Either way, it seems like the best way forward would be for coinbase to commit to producing ongoing proofs of solvency to put these doubts to rest.

This step has been simplified recently by the addition of the `fundrawtransaction` RPC:
    $ bitcoin-cli fundrawtransaction                     \
        $(bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction '[]'           \
            '{"13UNcCPrr8nfmDNN3DFXkbgrEANZKkspEJ":1.23}') \
        true
ie. you use `createrawtransaction` to make a raw transaction with the output you want to send and no inputs, and then use `fundrawtransaction` to do the coin selection. It selects and adds the inputs you need, calculates the fee, and adds a change output as well.
Here's an example using a watchonly wallet with a single 55 BTC output in it:
    $ bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction \
        $(bitcoin-cli fundrawtransaction \
            $(bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction '[]' \
                '{"13UNcCPrr8nfmDNN3DFXkbgrEANZKkspEJ":1.23}') \
            true | \
            grep hex | \
            cut -d'"' -f4) | \
        grep value
          "value": 53.76997740,
          "value": 1.23000000,
For this to work you need to have imported the watchonly addresses using `importpubkey` not `importaddress`, since it's impossible to build a transaction that spends from an address if you don't know its public key, and it's not possible in general to derive the public key if all you know is the address.

Regular contracts are written on paper and interpreted and enforced by courts.
Ethereum contracts are written in code and interpreted and enforced by code.
If people can arbitrarily redefine ethereum contracts once they are already in use then what use are they? I though the whole point of ethereum was that the contracts were ruled by code, not corruptible people.
Ethereum provided a platform. The DAO used it, poorly. I don't see how that is the responsibility of the ethereum developers to fix. If it was a bug in the ethereum platform itself then of course it needs fixing. But when it's just an app running on the platform I don't think it's justifiable to change the rules now. It's setting a dangerous precedent. Where do you draw the line when it comes to the inevitable similar errors that happen in the future?
Do we only make exceptions for contracts owned by friends of the dev team? Only for contracts worth more than $X million?

The best example to illustrate how transaction malleability *is* a real problem is the time when Mr. Ver himself got a "[$23K bitcoin transaction stuck despite paying the fee](
It turns out his "stuck" transaction was the 2nd half of a two-part chain of transactions, and the 1st half of the chain was malleated before confirmation, rendering the 2nd half unconfirmable.
I pointed this out to him in the thread linked above:




He replied, apologizing for pointing to the wrong cause of his problem in that particular instance but continues to claim that transaction malleability isn't a priority and that that specific stuck transaction was because of the 1MB blocksize limit.
It gets to a point where it is hard to give him the benefit of the doubt any more.

Pretty much, yes. Except private keys don't really have "balances", they each have 0 or more outputs that they are able to spend. I guess you could call those balances if you like, but the protocol itself doesn't sum them.


This depends on the wallet. Wallets are free to pick which of your unspent outputs they use, and it doesn't really matter much which ones they choose. Bitcoin Core's coin selection algorithm attempts to find the set of outputs which most closely matches the amount you're trying to spend without going under. Usually the wallet won't be able to find a set of unspent outputs that sums to exactly the right amount, so it picks a set of unspent outputs that sums to too much, and makes a transaction with two outputs: one paying your recipient, and the other paying the excess amount back to yourself as "change". As an end user you're usually not concerned with how the wallet is selecting which outputs to spend so long as it isn't doing anything stupid.

I'm not sure that knowing that a hash function has evenly distributed outputs tells you anything about the distribution of the inputs which have equal outputs.
But let's assume that it does, and that the 2^96 private keys for your address are evenly distributed through the 256 bit space.
It would mean that half of the 2^96 privkeys are in the first half of the 2^256 keys (0 - 2^(255)-1) and the other half are in the 2nd half (2^255 - 2^(256)-1). Wouldn't it?
Why do you think it would mean that half of the keys would be in the first tiny fraction of the space? The hash function used to convert pubkeys to addresses takes 256 bit inputs and maps them to 160 bit outputs. It doesn't really matter that the hash function is composed of SHA and RIPEMD parts, only the size of the inputs and outputs.

I worry that it's too easy to pick a wallet the "does HD wrong, then dies" and you end up with a backup that is incompatible with every existing wallet.
At least with an encrypted paper wallet you can keep a copy of the bitaddress.org page somewhere safe and be pretty confident that you'll be able to run it in the future. All you need is a single private key, which you will hopefully be able to import into whatever wallets exist in 30 years' time. With an HD wallet your coins could be distributed over multiple receiving and change addresses.
I'm no fortune teller either though, and I could well be wrong.

It's a soft fork, so existing clients will follow the chain created by new clients but won't fully understand segwit transactions. The old clients won't be able to download or validate the segregated witnesses and instead will think that those transactions don't require signatures at all.
Since segwit doesn't activate until 95% of the hashrate indicates support for it this shouldn't be a problem because any blocks mined by old clients will quickly be orphaned by the segwit majority.

You could do pretty much the same thing in Bitcoin in theory. Simply hard fork such that all coins in address A are considered to be in address B after block N. This could be as simple as changing the code for OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY in script/interpreter.cpp.
Of course, Bitcoin developers would never attempt to steal anyone's coins like this, and Bitcoin users and miners would never accept such theft.

RBF isn't a consensus change at all. It isn't any kind of a fork. It is a change to default miner policy.


No, that isn't any kind of a fork either.


That wasn't a fork either. That was individual miners independently deciding to mine smaller blocks. Nobody was rejecting 1MB blocks; there was no fork.
Forks happen when there is a change to the consensus rules. If the rules get tighter it's a soft fork. It the rules get looses it's a hard fork.
An example of the rules getting tighter would be CSV, the relative timelock change that is happening soon. Once that soft fork is activated all the previous rules still apply, but now there's a new rule that one of the NOP instructions will now be interpreted as prohibiting a transaction from confirming within some period (or number of blocks) of its parent confirming (or some such, I'm fuzzy on the details - but it's a new rule, making some blocks which would previously have been valid now become invalid).
An example of the rules getting looser would be a hard fork to increase the blocksize limit from 1MB to 2MB. All previous rules would still apply except for the blocksize limit, which would be relaxed to accept blocks with between 1MB and 2MB of data, which would previously have been rejected. This new rule would make some blocks which would previous have been invalid now become valid.


"The standard" hasn't changed. You simply misunderstood what constitutes a fork, and the distinction between hard and soft forks.

New features are developed on a side branch, so that the new feature can be tested in isolation without other development interfering with it.
Once the feature reaches maturity it is merged from the side branch onto the main branch along with all the other mature features. The "compact blocks" feature was merged a few days ago, for example.
So now anyone building from the main branch will get a build with both segwit and compact blocks, and we can test to see how well they work together.

We are talking about a majority of the hashrate deliberately orphaning blocks made by the minority, and replacing them with empty blocks. That is clearly an attack, with the majority of the hashrate "cooperating to
attack the network".


Maybe you're new here, but when a majority of the hashrate attacks the Bitcoin blockchain and uses their power to orphan legitimate blocks on purpose, that is called a "51% attack". You will find references to this term going back many years, unrelated to BU.

Except that you seem to be missing the important difference between a hard and soft fork.
If Bitcoin does a UASF to activate SegWit and some miners refuse to accept the new SegWit rules we will have two chains, let's call them SegCoin and OrigCoin. So long as the price of OrigCoin stays above that of SegCoin both chains survive, but if SegCoin wins the economic war miners will switch to it, and eventually the SegCoin chain will grow longer than the OrigCoin chain. At that point all the OrigCoin nodes will switch to the SegCoin chain, orphaning all the OrigCoin blocks. This is possible because SegWit is a soft fork and so all the SegCoin blocks are also valid on the OrigCoin.
In contrast a hard fork works in the opposite way. Suppose the blocksize limit is increased as a hard fork, ie. change the blocksize limit from 1MB to 2MB. We have OrigCoin and BigCoin nodes, and the chain forks as soon as a block &gt;1MB is mined. So long as the BigCoin chain stays longer than the OrigCoin chain we have two chains. But if the OrigCoin chain ever overtakes the BigCoin chain the BigCoin nodes will switch to the OrigCoin chain, orphaning all the BigCoin blocks.
Note that with a soft fork it is the people who don't upgrade who get their chain reorged, and with a hard fork it is the people who *do* upgrade who get reorged.

There's no "reverse hashing" going on. Just a lot of double forward hashing, and comparing the output with a target, and alerting when the double hash is lower than the target (which corresponds to the difficulty).
Note that satoshi disappeared from the scene *before* the reference Bitcoin client (as I think it was known at the time) implemented wallet encryption. And nobody (that I know of) has even an encrypted copy of satoshi's wallet anyway.
Edit: oh, you're talking about trying to guess his private keys, since we know his public keys? Maybe the development of quantum computers will make that more feasible. There has been some discussion of upgrading the encryption used in Bitcoin to protect against such advances. But that's a whole other can of worms...

I have very limited bandwidth and so I turned on `blocksonly=1` in my `bitcoin.conf` as well as `connect=a.b.c.d` for one specific remote node, so it only downloads each block once. It acts as a cache, sharing its blocks with multiple wallets on my LAN (via `connect=laptop1`, `connect=laptop2`, etc.)
It has been up for 2 months, and has downloaded just 8 GB, and shared 19 GB on the LAN:
At about 1 MB per block, and about 144 * 30 = 4320 blocks per month, that's about right.

I'm happy that Core is finally moving towards HD wallets so we no longer will need to worry about old backups expiring due to keypool exhaustion.
I stopped using Core as a wallet a while ago because I would rather use an HD implementation and not have to worry about the freshness of my backups.
It's a shame that this implementation is incompatible with my existing HD wallets. I would prefer a BIP44 compatible wallet in Core, but at least this is a start.

In 30 years you're unlikely to be able to run mycelium or breadwallet. You will have lost your current phone, or the charging cable will have broken and no longer be available. The backend mycelium servers will likely have stopped running.
You could make a backup of the 12 seed words, but then you have to worry about whether it's using BIP44 and BIP39 correctly, and which derivation path the coins are on.
I'd recommend storing the coins offline. A BIP38 encrypted paper wallet isn't a bad idea. Very hard to crack without knowing the passphrase, and a well-defined standard.

I think the situation OP is trying to describe is as follows:
1. someone sends some coins to a segwit address in transaction A
2. transaction A gets mined into a block by a segwit-aware miner
3. an attacker creates a non-segwit transaction B which appears to send the output of A to the victim who is running an old client, and who therefore accepts B as a payment to himself because to an old node it appears to have a trivially satisfied script
4. B gets mined into a block by a minority non-segwit miner
5. victim sees the confirmation and ships the goods
6. the block containing B is orphaned by the segwit majority
7. victim is out of pocket
Is that a reasonable scenario?

I took a look at the transactions, and the vast majority were 14kB transactions with insufficient fee, each with 200 inputs and 1 output.

Someone was rebroadcasting the same old bulky transactions over and over to keep mempools artificially full. Now they've stopped.

A block is valid precisely when its contents are valid. The block *is* its contents.
If you start deleting parts of blocks then it is no longer possible to determine whether the block was valid before you deleted part of it or not.


You are claiming that merely by having proof of work, a block can be trusted to be valid and doesn't need validating by any third parties. A corrupt 51% of the hash rate can make up whatever transactions they like, spending inputs they don't own and can't sign for, and the naive 3rd party would trust them in your world simply because the proof of work is correct.

Off the top of my head:
Transactions consist of a list of inputs being spent, and a list of outputs being created. The inputs include signatures proving that the spender is allowed to spend them, and the outputs include details of what proof will be required to spend them.
Segregated Witness ("sigwit") separates the input signatures from the rest of the transaction, and collects them in a new separate area which is counted at a 75% discount towards the 1 million byte blocksize limit. This allows more transactions to fit in each block, allows full nodes to throw away signatures once they have verified them (reducing storage requirements), allows light nodes to never have to download signatures (reducing bandwidth requirements), and removes txid malleability (since the signatures are no longer part of the transaction that is hashed to produce its txid). The discounted size (and hence fee) for signatures effectively makes it cheaper to spend old dust outputs than it is to create new dust outputs, hopefully providing an incentive for people to tidy up unspent outputs, or at least not create too many unnecessary new ones.

I was with you until there, but the 2nd youngest is "3:" not "2:", so I think you went wrong here. Also, we're sharing out 16 million BTC, not 16 of them, and you also seem to be assuming that 1 BTC is indivisible. 1 satoshi is better than nothing probably.
Let's assume A is the youngest, B is 2nd youngest, etc.
When just A remains, A gets it all.
    A proposes:  A = everything
When A and B remain, B can give himself all the coins because A's vote doesn't matter:
    B proposes: A = 0, B = everything
With A, B, and C, C knows he can never get B's vote so he has to get A's. C needs to offer A some positive amount to secure his vote:
    C proposes: A = 1 sat, B = 0, C = the rest
With A, B, C, D: D needs support from one other. He can offer a single satoshi to B and take the rest:
    D proposes: A = 0, B = 1 sat, C = 0, D = the rest
With A-E, E needs support from two others. A and C both get 0 if E is killed, so he can offer those 2 a single satoshi each and keep the rest:
    E proposes: A = 1 sat, B = 0, C = 1 sat, D = 0, E = the rest
With A-F, F needs support from two others. B and D both get 0 if F is killed, so he can offer those 2 a single satoshi each and keep the rest:
    F proposes: A = 0, B = 1 sat, C = 0, D = 1 sat, E = 0, F = the rest
With 7 left, the oldest need votes from 3 others. He gives 1 satoshi to the 3 who get nothing if he dies. The other 3 get nothing.
With 8 left, the oldest need votes from 3 others. He gives 1 satoshi to the 3 who get nothing if he dies. The other 4 get nothing.
With 9 left, the oldest need votes from 4 others. He gives 1 satoshi to the 4 who get nothing if he dies. The other 4 get nothing.
With 10 left, the oldest need votes from 4 others. He gives 1 satoshi to the 4 who get nothing if he dies. The other 5 get nothing.
With 2N left, the oldest needs to secure votes from N-1 others. He gives 1 satoshi to the N-1 who would get nothing if he dies and keeps the rest. The other N get nothing.
With 5 million left, the oldest needs to secure votes from 2499999 others. He gives 1 satoshi to the 2499999 who would get nothing if he dies and keeps the rest. The other 2.5 million get nothing.
So the oldest one gets 15999999.97500001 BTC, the 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc. oldest get 1 satoshi each. The rest get nothing.

What does it mean for Bitcoin to increase in value? Against what? You could value each by considering how many US dollars they would buy, or how many ounces of gold. Or barrels of oil. Or whatever.
Since you're probably not considering USD, gold, or oil as possible things to be holding, why not just look at the price of BTC in CAD. Then you only have two scenarios:
1. Price of BTC in CAD goes up. This is good if you're holding BTC.
2. Price of BTC in CAD goes down. This is bad if you're holding BTC.
It sounds as if you're deciding whether to hold BTC or CAD. In that case all that matters is the price of BTC in CAD, and which direction it's going to go.

Take a look at [this page]( - it clearly shows that there are currently 1414 unconfirmed transactions paying 1.807 sat/vB, each around 36.8 kB in size. That's 52 MvB of unconfirmed transaction data paying 1.807 sat/vB which doesn't show up at all on the chart you linked to.

I didn't downvote it, but I can guess some reasons why:
* blockchain.info has a pretty bad history of losing customer funds through various bugs and hacks
* web wallets in general aren't as secure as local wallets; even though blockchain.info don't ever get to access your private keys themselves it's not a good idea to trust your coins' security to client-side javascript
* if this is a large enough amount that OP thought it worth moving to cold storage, it's probably also worth using a safer option than blockchain.info to sweep the keys

In the past I have had 4 figure amounts of BTC on Mycelium and never had a problem with the coins being lost or stolen.
While it's true that your keys are stored unencrypted in the app's private storage, if your phone isn't rooted and there's no bug in Android then other apps shouldn't be able to read them.
I wouldn't keep such large amounts on a phone these days, but this is at least anecdotal evidence that Mycelium is somewhat trustworthy.

As says, it really depends on how the password is protected. For decent protection you want to use a derivation function that takes a significant amount of time to run. You don't care if it takes a second to verify that you typed the correct password if that also means it takes an attacker a second to check each of his guesses when trying to break your password.
But for the purposes of this question, let's assume that your password is protected by a single sha256 hash.
 tells me that the Bitcoin miners are testing 1.5 * 10^18 hashes per second. Bitcoin 'hashes' are double-sha256, so that's 3 * 10^18 sha256 hashes per second, or 2.6 * 10^23 sha256 hashes per 24 hours.
2.6 * 10^23 is approximately 2^78, so your guess of "80 bit" isn't far off.
Of course, most Bitcoin mining hardware is hardcoded to run double-sha256 hashes, which is useless for anything other than Bitcoin mining. I doubt it's possible to get a Bitcoin ASIC to run single sha256 hashes. So for all practical purposes Bitcoin miners wouldn't be any use in cracking passwords.

You're asking two questions:
1. How do we know the string was generated randomly (as opposed to being custom crafted to make the player lose)?
2. How do we know that the string was used to generate the deck (as opposed to just being 'for show')?
The 2nd question is easier to answer: the site publishes its algorithm for how it goes from the 'random' string to a deck of cards. Players can follow the algorithm themselves once the random string is revealed, and verify that it does it fact generate the same cards as they saw in their game.
The 1st question is harder, and some sites fail to address it at all.
The way good provably fair sites answer the first question is as follows:
1. make up a random "server seed" for the player, but keep it secret for now
2. publish the hash of the "server seed"
3. ask the player to pick his own seed, known as the "client seed"
4. use a hash of the server seed AND the client seed together to generate the random string which determines uniquely how the deck will be shuffled
5. play the game
6. reveal the server seed
Since (4) depends on both (1) and (3), and (3) happens after (1), the site cannot control how the deck will be shuffled. The client seed is picked last, which effectively is letting the play have the last shuffle of the deck.
After the game, (6) lets the player check that the site in fact did use the server seed they committed to in (2), so the player can be sure that the site picked first, and only then did the player pick his client seed.
It's kind of like an escrow system. If the site published the server seed first, then the player could cheat by picking a client seed which plays well with the published server seed. Conversely, if the player was asked to pick the client seed first, the site could check by picking a server seed which plays badly with it. So what happens is the site picks its server seed, commits to it (by publishing its hash) but doesn't reveal it until the player has picked his client seed and played the game.

There is a limit of 1 million bytes per block. That limits the number of transactions that can be included in the blockchain each day.
As block space is now under contention the more trivial transactions will drop off. Previously where it may have been free to encode photographs into the blockchain now it would be more expensive to do so, and so less people would be willing to waste the shared resource that is the blockchain in this way.

I loaded some old wallets about 24 hours ago and found 3 with coins in them. I wanted to transfer the coins to a new wallet, so I used Bitcoin Core's `sendtoaddress` RPC call to attempt to send the whole balance to a new address. It told me I couldn't, because I needed to include a fee of at least X (it told me what X was) so I subtracted X from the balance and tried again. Again it complained that I couldn't send that much, because I needed to include a fee of at least X2 (a little larger than X) so I kept going around this loop until it let me send the transaction. I repeated the same for the other two wallets as well.
The 1st and 3rd transactions confirmed after [24h]( and [21h]( respectively, and the 2nd one is [yet to confirm](
I was under the impression that Bitcoin Core would include an appropriate fee to have the transactions confirm in a reasonable time period, but I guess I was wrong.
What is the recommended way of sending the whole balance of a wallet to another address using Bitcoin Core's RPC interface such that a proper fee is included?

Because the "powers that be" are meant to be contract code and logic, not VB and friends.

4. start bitcoind
5. wait for it to rescan the blocks that have been mined since the last time I loaded this wallet
6. check balance
7. spend balance to new address
Maybe step 1. is wiping the mempool and so losing any information it has about fees.


What does that mean? Where do you specify the number of blocks? The only parameters I see are:
    Arguments:
    1. "bitcoinaddress"  (string, required) The bitcoin address to send to.
    2. "amount"      (numeric or string, required) The amount in BTC to send. eg 0.1
    3. "comment"     (string, optional) A comment used to store what the transaction is for. 
                                 This is not part of the transaction, just kept in your wallet.
    4. "comment-to"  (string, optional) A comment to store the name of the person or organization 
                                 to which you're sending the transaction. This is not part of the 
                                 transaction, just kept in your wallet.
    5. subtractfeefromamount  (boolean, optional, default=false) The fee will be deducted from the amount being sent.
                                 The recipient will receive less bitcoins than you enter in the amount field.
Thanks for drawing my attention to `subtractfeefromamount`. I didn't see that before. I guess it's relatively new. But I still don't see where to specify how fast I would like the confirmation to be.

You simply didn't include enough of a fee. It really wasn't expensive to get transactions mined during the recent transaction spam attack.
At the height of the attack I sent 4 transactions, each of 3 BTC, each one using a different one of the 4 fee settings in Mycelium.
I posted my results [here]( but in summary:
Transactions fees:
* 0.00002072 BTC for low-priority (2 cents), 223 bytes, 9.3 sat/byte
* 0.00003885 BTC for economic (4 cents), 223 bytes, 17.4 sat/byte
* 0.00005180 BTC for normal (5 cents), 224 bytes, 23.1 sat/byte
* 0.00025900 BTC for priority (25 cents), 223 bytes, 116.1 sat/byte
Confirmation times:
* low-priority - 2 cents : confirmed in the 60th mined block, after 535 minutes (5 minutes short of 9 hours)
* economic - 4 cents : confirmed in the 3rd mined block, after 20 minutes
* normal - 5 cents : confirmed in the 3rd mined block, after 20 minutes
* priority - 25 cents : confirmed in the first mined block, after 15 minutes
ie. so long as I was prepared to pay at least 4 cents for my transaction (20 satoshis per byte) it got mined within 20 minutes. And this is while people are actively trying to make it as hard as possible to get a transaction confirmed to promote their "bigger blocks now" campaign.

If a single miner or cartel of miners gets to control over 50% of the hash power, they can censor transactions. Whether those transactions are opening and closing LN payment channels or not doesn't change that.
The aim is to prevent the large miners from pricing the smaller miners out of the market to keep Bitcoin somewhat decentalized. LN allows us to scale without massively bloating the blocksize. Big blocks are bad for miner decentralization, and so limiting the blocksize is good for miner decentralization. LN gives us longer before we need to raise the blocksize limit by allowing the majority of transactions to move offchain.

Let me try:
If Bitcoins are worth $100k each but it only costs $90k to mine each one then it is worth buying yourself some mining equipment. People will do this. This will increase the cost of mining until the cost of mining meets the value of the reward.
It's nothing about the value of securing the network, or how much security is needed. It's a result of miners acting out of their own self interest. If the reward is much higher than the price of mining then mining is attractive and will increase.

The correct answer is 10 minutes. But here's another possible position:
* pick a random point in time
* the average time to the next block is 10 minutes
* the average time since the last block is 10 minutes
* so the average time between the two blocks around any random point in time is 20 minutes
How can that be, if the average time between blocks is really 10 minutes?
Is there a flaw in my reasoning? Or is the average time between two blocks around a random point in time 20 minutes?

1 vB (virtual byte) is a quarter of a weight unit.
Each byte in a witness part of a transaction counts as 1 weight unit, and each byte in the non-witness part of a transaction counts as 4 weight units.
If a transaction has no witness part then its weight will be 4 times its size in bytes, and so its "virtual size" will be a quarter of its weight, which will be the same as its actual size.
The virtual size of a transaction (in vB) is what is used to calculated the fee being paid. Miners divide the transaction fee by the virtual size of the transaction to get the fee-per-vB, and rank transactions by that. So if there were two transactions of the same physical size paying the same total fee, the one with the bigger percentage of witness bytes to non-witness bytes would be preferred (and mined first).
The idea is to give a "discount" for witness data to make it more cost effective to combine old utxos than to create new ones.

Check [these transactions]( out.
That's 2690 transactions, each combining 250 small outputs into 1 bigger output. So the number of unspent outputs was reduced by 249 by each of these 2690 transactions, reducing the total number of unspent outputs by 2690 * 249 = 669,810.
The number of unspent outputs [typically grows about 100k per day]( so taking off a few hundred k for the time it took to confirm these 2690 big transactions, that leaves a net utxo size reduction of about half a million.

I don't think that's true. The average time to the next block is 10 minutes, but there is a greater than 60% chance of the next block being found in the next 10 minutes.
In other words, most blocks take less than 10 minutes to be mined, but some take much longer, bringing the average time down to 10 minutes.
To test this theory, I checked the time (in seconds) each of the last 1000 blocks took. Here's the list, in order, 100 per line:

See how the first 6 lines are all less than 600 seconds? That's because there's a &gt;60% chance of the next block being found in 10 minutes.
The average of these numbers is 588.179, pretty close to the expected 600.

A regular transaction can send coins to a SegWit address and be mined by a legacy miner who doesn't even know what SegWit is. A coin sent to a SegWit address can only be spent by a transaction with a segregated witness, and can only be mined by a SegWit-aware miner.
All wallets can already send to SegWit addresses, since they look just like any other P2SH address. Bitcoin Core is ready to spend from SegWit addresses too. Generate your address using `addwitnessaddress "address"`, where "address" is a new address in your wallet, give that address to the people paying you. They won't know it's a SegWit address until you first spend from it, since that reveals the script.

I didn't say the white paper had a block limit. I said Bitcoin does. The white paper also doesn't have multisig, pay-to-script-hash addresses, or SegWit. Bitcoin has all of these.


The B2X network will ignore them. The Bitcoin network will continue as before, enforcing its rules. See also: Bitcoin Cash.


Are you suggesting that the majority of Bitcoin nodes are running B2X compatible rules?

@_date: 2017-08-02 18:07:23
There's a typo:


And the article doesn't address these common criticisms:
* SegWit incentivizes miners to do validationless mining because it is quicker to download a block without witnesses than with. Eventually no miners will be mining, someone will mine an invalid transaction and nobody will notice until it's too late. Because nobody will run a validating node. Because reasons.
* SegWit outputs are "anyone can spend" to miners can steal them. We know there's a million dollar Litecoin SegWit output that hasn't been stolen, but that's because the thief is waiting to steal a billion dollar Bitcoin SegWit output rather than shoot his load early stealing a paltry million dollars of Litecoin and tipping everyone off.
* SegWit only roughly doubles the capacity but it 4x's the worst case spam scenario.
* SegWit unfairly discounts fees for SegWit transactions. Central planning. AXA. Bilderburg. Etc.
It would be nice to have those debunked too. If you can!
Also, anchors at the start of each section to allow linking to particular answers would be useful.

The agreement was made between a few rich people in a private meeting. It's not an agreement that the community was party to. Even the Core developers weren't invited to the discussions. By sticking to the original consensus rules we aren't backing out of anything.
If the small group of rich dudes want to make another fork, they're welcome to do so, though I don't see why they wouldn't just use the Bcash fork that a different small group made recently. Do we need a separate altcoin for each small group of discontents?

OP is probably alluding to the fact that you don't keep money in your Bitcoin wallet, you keep private keys in there. The Bitcoins live on the blockchain, and all you have in your wallet is some keys. So "wallet" doesn't really work very well as a description of what's going on.
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:18:44
True, but as usually, not helpful.
What you omitted saying is that wallets created by recent versions of Core use a master seed to create all private keys, and so a single backup is sufficient to back up all future private keys.

It doesn't matter what he was using. What matters is that he was mining and so could you have been. Any old CPU was able to mine in 2009.
Even if you didn't have a computer, you could have bought 1000 BTC for around a dollar total in those days, and have around a million dollars worth of BTC today.
My point is that it wasn't his "leg up" that earned him the rewards, it was his brain - whatever in him made him think "that looks interesting" rather than "that's a scam" when he first heard about Bitcoin.

If I'm the house and I see a player only ever bets on red, I can cheat him by making sure red comes up less often than black. Maybe I notice that he never bets on zero, so I make sure zero comes up 1 in 30 spins instead of 1 in 37.
He can counter by taking advantage of this by betting black more often, but it's better for everyone if the house can prove that their roll generation is not only committed to in advance but also impossible for them to cheat.

He's suggesting using leverage to multiply the effect of any price rises.
If you "go long 100x" at bitmex, you gain $100 per BTC every time the price goes up by $1. But you also lose everything if the price goes down by 1%. It's a way of increasing both the risk and the potential reward.

It's quite possible that mining using the S4 could still be profitable. For example maybe it costs you $2000 worth of electricity to mine each Bitcoin, but by the end of the year they're worth $5000 each. That would be profitable, right?
But even more profitable would be to buy the Bitcoins from a more efficient miner, pay $900 each for them, and be even more profitable by the end of the year.
When I tried mining, Bitcoin was worth 50 cents each or something. It took me a month of CPU mining on my laptop to mine my first 1 BTC, and presumably cost much more than 50 cents' worth of power to do so. But the 1 BTC I mined is now worth more than the power I burned mining it, so in that sense it was worth doing.

Because there is more competition these days.
The difficulty of mining automatically goes up as the competition increases to keep the rate of creation steady.
(Also the rate of creation halves every 4 years, but that's a minor effect compared to the rate of increase of competition for mining).

How do we measure how much of 'the network' is enforcing a soft fork?
Once a soft fork has activated, if a minority of miners stop enforcing it then that minority will be mining an invalid fork of the blockchain and will have their blocks orphaned by the majority. If a majority of the miners stop enforcing it then things get confusing. Nodes which have updated to the new rules will reject the longest chain and those which haven't will accept it.

Enterprising miners could offer a service whereby they process your transactions first, but require a refundable deposit from you. If your transaction ends up referencing a dark-dao address then you forfeit your deposit. Any DoS attacker wouldn't be able to use the service without repeatedly forfeiting their deposit, and so this would provide a cheap way of bypassing the attack.

Bitcoin isn't valuable directly because of the energy that is burned securing it. It is valuable because it is useful as a money, which is partly because it is secure, which is a result of the mining (which happens to take energy).

I've not had that problem, but if it's showing you a decent number of outputs I would suggest spending just those ones (on both chains) and reloading the page. I guess it will show new ones once you've spent the ones it showed you. You probably want to consolidate those outputs into a smaller number of bigger amounts anyway, while the network fees are relatively low. The mempool is kind of spammy at the moment, but if you're willing to wait you can usually get into a block at 50sat/byte or so.


It is. Your node should allow it. There are also places online that will broadcast signed raw transactions for you. The first three I can think of:
* 
* 
* 
It's safe to use them - your private keys aren't part of the signed transaction. Just `createrawtransaction` and `signrawtransaction` locally, then copy/paste the output to one of those pages.

Yes. You can download the current version here: 
Edit: although, the old version you used wouldn't have made a replaceable transaction, so I don't think the new version will allow you to "increase fee" even if you install it.
What you can do is create and sign a raw transaction which double-spends the coins used in the unconfirmed transaction and broadcast that through a third party node. I can help you with that if you like, either here or in private message. Let me know if you want my help. The first step would be to click that "copy raw transaction" menu entry from your photo and paste the result to me. That would tell me which coins you were trying to spend, but not let me spend them.

It's not possible in general to prove that someone doesn't know the private key for an address.
It's an interesting exercise to try to find a way that this game could be make cheat-proof, but I've not come up with anything yet.
The obvious problem with the current implementation is that the admin can see each bet as it comes in, and can choose to win whenever he wants. Publishing the source code doesn't help, since we have no way of knowing that the published code matches the live code on the server.
SatoshiDice (the on-chain version) solves this problem by having a daily secret which is committed to (its hash is published) in advance by the site, and which is hashed together with the player's deposit txid to produce the result of the bet. Since the player doesn't know the daily secret, and the site can't control the player's txid neither party can cheat the other.
That kind of scheme works well for player-vs-the-site style games, but not for 2 player games, because both players need to be able to know that their opponent isn't the site admin. And they can't.
A step in the right direction to fixing this would be to have both players publish a salted hash of their bet first: `sha256("I bet 0.5 BTC jiejoiwehfiuwi")` and once both hashes are known, they both publish the original text. The site verifies that the text hashes to the hash that was previously supplied. That way the site admin can't cheat, because he doesn't know how much the player has bet until he himself has committed to a bet.
But how do we make sure the losing player pays up? If we don't require payment until after the result is known he can just leave and never pay. We could require payment in advance, before the hashes are sent in. Maybe over-payment is allowed, so nobody can see the exact amount being bet. But the admin can still know an upper bound on the bet size. If the deposit is 10 BTC then we know the bet must be at most 10 BTC, and so the admin bets 11 BTC and wins.
We could require deposits to happen between the submission of the hashes and the submission of the plain text. But someone would have to go first. And if the admin went second, he could be sure sometimes that he had won the bet. If he sees a deposit of 10 BTC and himself has hashed "I bet 11 BTC wjfhwoifhw" then he's good to continue the bet. Otherwise there's a change he lost, so he just never pays.
So we could add a rule that there's a maximum bet size, and that both players much deposit at least that amount before playing. But then wouldn't everyone just bet the maximum amount every round, hoping to catch a noob betting less?
In short I don't see a way of making this game trustless.
Oh, another thing. From the bitcointalk announcement, re. double spend attacks:


You're missing something here... the attacker would only attempt to double-spend when he loses. The bets he wins would go through, and the bets he loses would be cancelled. That's not "no harm done". You're waiting for a confirmation on both sides at least, and that limited the attack surface, but the reasoning in the forum post isn't valid.

I was thinking about that. It seems like a reasonable idea.
"We" need make sure they find a block at least every 1.99 hours to prevent the EDA bug.
I wonder if any of the mining pools would be willing to allow their users to select an option whereby they help the BCH chain avoid the EDA adjustments when necessary, but otherwise mine real BTC.
I worry about the poor BCH users having to wait in Starbucks for over 5 hours for a confirmation. It would be better if they were guaranteed never having to wait longer than 1 hour 59 minutes, don't you agree?

Language evolves, words change meanings.
It's all entirely arbitrary, so can't be "wrong".
I wouldn't say "using it wrong", I'd say "using it wrongly", since "wrong" is an adjective and "wrongly" is an adverb. But it seems popular in the US to use adjectives in place of adverbs ("think different", for example). They also miss the 'u' out of lots of words ("color" instead of "colour"). It looks "wrong" to me, but seems to be entirely widespread. So maybe it's just different, not wrong.

I think it's a pretty fundamental distinction, not pedantic.
If the coins were in the wallet making a copy of the wallet would double your number of coins. Calling it a wallet makes people think wrongly about it, and causes them to make incorrect assumptions about how things work.
I prefer to think of my wallet as containing a bunch of keys to safety deposit boxes. Then it makes sense that making a copy of the wallet just makes a copy of the keys, and doesn't double my wealth. Similarly, destroying the only copy of my wallet doesn't destroy the money, it just destroys the only copy of the keys that can open the boxes that contain the money.


Right. And no one keeps keys in a wallet. Bitcoin has become money. It just isn't kept in wallets. It is kept on the blockchain, and spent using the keys that we keep in our "wallets".

So this 0.2 BTC deposit was the first time the address was ever used. That rules out all the most obvious ways you could have received the coins.
Did you ever tell that particular address to anyone? Like maybe you started a trade with someone on LBC but they cancelled it after you had given them the deposit address?
If not, it's hard to see how anyone would know the address. The chances of anyone guessing it are effectively zero. If you didn't give the address to anyone then I can only think that LBC themselves leaked it somehow. You should ask them about it, because it is quite concerning, even though you did come out ahead in this situation.

No, it's not very good for that. The Bitcoin-network is currently subsidized through inflation, meaning transactions cost about thirty dollars each. This vision of Bitcoin as a faster, cheaper and better payments-network is simply not tied to any technological grounding of what Bitcoin is really about. If we want to make Bitcoin a competitor to Visa or MasterCard, we would need to increase the blocksize and centralize mining so much that it is basically the same as existing payments networks. And even then, at some point, we'll reach a limit where Bitcoin is just not cost-efficient. We don't need to have all these miners crunching numbers just so people can buy a coffee. That's insane.

That's not quite true. Every 3 words in the seed phrase give you 32 bits of data and 1 bit of checksum. So a 24 word seed gives you 256 bits of data and only 8 bits of checksum. That means that one in 256 guesses has the correct checksum.
There are 24*23/2 = 276 ways of switching 2 words out of 24, of which likely only one will yield a valid checksum.
And there are 24*23*22/2/3 = 2024 ways of switching 3 words out of 24, of which around 8 will have valid checksums.
So it really wouldn't be too hard to exhaustively test all possible 2 and 3 way rearrangements.

Almost every listening node is listening on port 8333. Even if they aren't it doesn't matter.

In fairness, it doesn't fix malleability, and the block verification time issue was quadratic, not exponential. I'm not sure if BCH fixes the quadratic block verification time issue or not, but I think since it uses the SegWit code for signing transactions it likely does.

What does JBOK stand for?
Note that the Core keypool contains 100 addresses by default, but can be increased using something like `keypool=1000` in your bitcoin.conf file.
The keypool is used both for change addresses and receiving addresses. Every time you ask for a new receiving address and (almost) every time you make a new outgoing transaction you use up an address from the keypool.
The keypool is refreshed constantly, but only while the wallet is unlocked. To see this, make a new play wallet, encrypt it, don't unlock it, and try to generate 101 new receiving addresses. You won't be able to, because it only has 100 ready and can't create any more until you unlock it.
So it's worth unlocking your wallet before making a backup of it. That way you can be sure it has a full keypool.

The bitcoin fork fixed a bug in bitcoin.
The proposed ethereum fork ~~fixes~~ *reverses the damage done by* a bug in one of the many contracts. It doesn't fix a bug in ethereum, but special-cases one particular address.
If bitcoin had been hard-forked to undo any of the major thefts that have happened in its history then that would be comparable to what the ethereum devs are proposing doing to fix this mess, and people would be justified in saying that bitcoin had failed. Bitcoin is meant to act like cash. Being able to be stolen is one of the properties of cash that makes it work. I wouldn't want a bitcoin where the devs arbitrarily decided which address to leave alone and which to blacklist.
So yes, ethereum fails if it arbitrarily invalidates the coins at a particular address to help out a project that went live with a buggy contract. It sets a horrible precedent.

No, I've not. I've seen an awful lot of very nearly empty blocks.


Right. It was rushed out with very little preparation.


Do you have any evidence for that claim?


No, it forked with a small minority of the hashrate. It was very vulnerable to 51% attacks. It's only thanks to the honest of the miners that no attacks happened. That doesn't mean it isn't insecure.


It gives you bigger blocks and cheaper transactions.


Try using SegWit. It makes your transactions cheaper.


I don't have to buy things every month to be a Bitcoin user. I am actually using the currency, just not to buy things. Why would I spend BTC on things when it's better to spend USD on them? The BTC will be worth more tomorrow, so it's wasteful to spend them.


What works is off-chain solutions. What doesn't work is expecting that every full node will record every little purchase that every Bitcoin user in the world ever makes.


Nobody's telling you how things should work, just how they do work. You are free to keep making altcoins which work differently if you like. Good luck with that.


According to the consensus rules.


You still don't get it. Miners don't vote on anything other than which valid chain to build upon.


SegWit was a soft fork. It didn't require a vote. It was set to activate only after 95% of blocks were signalling for it as a safety measure, but that wasn't necessary. It was the Core developers being conservative and making sure that there was overwhelming support for SegWit before having it activate.


I don't think that will happen. Time will tell.


You're embarrassing yourself. What the fuck is a "moon kid" and why would you think I'm not an early adopter? Do you not see that I've been on reddit for 10 years? That I've been on BitcoinTalk and contributing to the Bitcoin Core node software since January 2011?


Evidence for this claim? Bigger blocks take longer to broadcast and longer to validate. That puts downwards pressure on miner decentralization, which has a negative effect on security.


We see that the miners mine BCH whenever it's the more profitable coin to mine. That's what I meant by "hashpower will follow price".


I'm unaware of them funding any propoganda censorship. Do you have evidence for this? Why would propoganda censorship require funding? I don't think it's unreasonable to criticize Ver's position. He seems to misunderstand the situation as badly if not worse than you do. I don't think it's helpful to call people names, and it's regrettable that it happens, but I don't see any problem with arguing against his faulty positions.

What do you mean by "backed" in that context?
What does "Its backed by scarcity" mean?
US dollars used to be backed by gold until the 70's. Each dollar was redeemable for an amount of gold.
Your Coinbase balance is hopefully backed by Bitcoin. Each Bitcoin in your Coinbase balance should hopefully be redeemable for a real Bitcoin.
Goldmoney is apparently backed by gold. You can request that they ship you an amount of gold corresponding to your balance.
But gold and Bitcoin aren't backed by anything. They are their own things. You can't redeem 1 BTC for any amount of "scarcity". Likewise gold is just gold. It isn't redeemable for anything else (not even the work that went into mining it), though you can of course exchange it for stuff at market rate.

No, it's because in a decentralized system nobody knows what time it is. I mean how do we agree when the time is without trusting a central authority? We can't have a rule "new blocks must not have a timestamp older than 1 hour ago" if we can't agree on what the current time is - or when they found the block. And so we have rules like this:
    // Check timestamp against prev
    if (block.GetBlockTime() &lt;= pindexPrev-&gt;GetMedianTimePast())
        return state.Invalid(false, REJECT_INVALID, "time-too-old", "block's timestamp is too early");
    // Check timestamp
    if (block.GetBlockTime() &gt; nAdjustedTime + MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME)
        return state.Invalid(false, REJECT_INVALID, "time-too-new", "block timestamp too far in the future");
The first rule is saying that a new block will be rejected if its timestamp is earlier than the median of the previous 11 blocks' timestamps. Basically timestamps can't go backwards more than about 6 blocks worth (an hour).
The second rule is saying that a new block will be rejected if its timestamp is later than 2 hours from now, where 'now' is the median of the times that all our peers say they think the current time is and the time we think it currently is. Basically timestamps can't be too far in the future.

It is the miners who decide what fees they will accept. If you are a miner you are free to only mine transactions which pay at least (0.005 * input_value). You might find that other miners with lower fees end up taking most of the transaction fees, but that's how competition works.

He performed one *round* of SHA-256 in 16 minutes 45 seconds, but a single SHA-256 hash requires 64 rounds, and a single Bitcoin mining "hash" requires two SHA-256 operations, so 128 rounds.

It is nothing to do with SHA-256.
* The first 210k blocks created 50 BTC each.
* The next 210k blocks created 25 BTC each.
* Then 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, etc. halving every 210k blocks.
Summing all those amounts:
    50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + ... = 100
so we end up with 210k times 100 = 21 million coins.
It's actually slightly less, due to rounding errors, etc.

The 'problems' are just there to make it hard to mine a block. If it was easy, everyone would be making blocks all the time and there would be too many coins around, and a currency has to be scarce to have value.
Also, each block is a record of which transactions are valid. Bitcoin is decentralized; nobody is in charge. There's no central bank or anything like it. So how do we decide who gets to write each block? It matters, because the blocks are a permanent record of which coins belong to which address. We decide by letting whoever can solve these 'problems' first write the next block.
**tl;dr**: the problems are for two things: 1) to maintain coin scarcity and 2) as a way of selecting the author of each block without having anyone 'in charge' to make that decision

You can't tell what outputs belong to the same person as the inputs in general. The 550k transaction is known to have been MtGox consolidating coins. The 50k change is due to an old bug in Core which resulted in change being made even when it wasn't needed. It makes no sense to show that as a 500k transaction. It takes 11 50k inputs and creates a 500k and a 50k output, all in the same wallet.

The problem is that you can't increase the blocksize limit without forking the chain unless you have consensus to do so. That's why it's a bad thing.

It isn't. I've had transactions confirm when it had way less fees than most transactions in the mempool.

There were other exchanges at the time, and MtGox weren't making up fake prices, they (whoever was running the bot) were actually buying up real Bitcoins, but using fake dollars to do so. Exchange customers were left with large dollar balances which they were unable to withdraw. And the Willy Bot was left with a large number of Bitcoins which it presumably was able to withdraw. Arbitrage ensured that the price rose across all exchanges, as people bought BTC low on the other exchanges to sell it high on Gox, not realizing that they would never be able to withdraw the dollars from Gox.
The same could happen today if a single large exchange was giving itself large dollar balances and using them to buy up customers' Bitcoins.

I can't upload a bootstrap file anywhere, it's too big for my limited bandwidth.
You don't need the blockchain to sign a transaction that spends an output though. All you need are the txid, vout, scriptPubKey, and privKey. Search for `bcc signrawtransaction` in OP to see how I create and sign a transaction knowing only those 4 things.
The 4 things you need:
* txid - the transaction ID of the transaction that created the utxo
* vout - the number of the output within that transaction, counting from zero; if you want to spend the 1st output vout is 0, for the 2nd it's 1, etc.
* scriptPubKey - you can find this by running "validateaddress" on the address you're trying to spend from in your Bitcoin Core wallet
* privKey - the private key of the address you're trying to spend from
My command also uses two other pieces of information:
* dest - the address to send to
* amount - the amount to send
You're responsible for making sure that the amount to send is correct. It should be the amount in the output you're spending minus the amount of fee you want to pay. If you make a mistake you could end up paying a massive fee with no way of getting it back.

I could probably manage with 2 MB blocks, and probably couldn't with 8 MB blocks unless I really restricted my number of peers.
I don't really care if there are more nodes, I mostly care whether I can continue to run my node or not.
The blockchain is already over 120 GB and growing about 140 MB per day with 1 MB blocks. That's 1 GB per week, 50 GB per year. That's quite a burden on new nodes just getting started.
8 MB blocks would mean adding 400 GB per year to the blockchain, so in just 5 years you'd need to download more than 2 TB just to get your full node synced up. I don't know how bandwidth caps will evolve over the next 5 years but I think it is a mistake to commit to adding up to 400 GB per year to the blockchain without knowing bandwidth caps will grow correspondingly to let new users get started.

The market is a bunch of orders. Some people trying to buy BTC and some trying to sell BTC. Whenever someone wants to buy for the same price that someone wants to sell at, the two people are matched up and the two orders cancel each other out, vanishing from the orderbook.
So all you ever see on screen are the orders which didn't get matched yet.
You will see people wanting to sell for higher than people are willing to pay, and people wanting to buy for lower than people are willing to sell at.
The "spread" is simply the gap between the highest buy offer and the lowest sell offer. If the last traded price is $900, but nobody is willing to pay more than $850 and nobody is willing to sell for $950, there is a $100 spread. High spreads indicate an illiquid market. If I wanted to sell coins right now into that market I would be selling for $850, and losing $50 per coin compared to the most recently traded price. When you have lots of players in a market they will tend to outbid each other, narrowing the spread as they do so. This is good for casual market participants since they are able to trade very near the last price. It's not so good for people trying to make a profit by trading the spread. If I can repeatedly buy at $850 and sell back at $950 I'm clearly making a good profit each time I do so. When the spread is narrower I'm making less per cycle (but probably doing more cycles per day, so maybe that makes up for it).
The volume is simply how many BTCs changed hands in the last 24 hours due to orders being matched. You'll see much higher volume on the Chinese exchanges (see [bitcoinwisdom]( for a good overview of lots of exchange prices and volumes) and that's mostly because they don't charge a fee on the trades done there.
Candles have a rectangular body, and a wick at the top and/or bottom. Each candle represents a period of time. 5 minutes by default. The candle is red if the last trade in the period was at a lower price than the first trade in the period, and green otherwise. The top and bottom of the body indicate the first and last trade prices. The height of the top wick indicates the highest traded price in the time period and the depth of the bottom wick indicates the lowest traded price in the time period. When you mouse-over a candle, you'll see numbers at the top of the chart updating: O (open - the first traded price in the period), H (the highest), L (the lowest), C (close - the last), and V (the volume in BTC for that period).

It's the same with blocks. If you make a transaction right now it is more likely that you will find yourself in a big gap between blocks than in a small time between blocks. Because the big gaps are bigger they're easier to find...

Note that to broadcast transactions to the network you don't need any blockchain at all. You can `createrawtransaction` and `signrawtransaction` without any blocks.  Even with `-noconnect` to prevent network connections at all they still work.
You can get a text-based list of unspent outputs here:
It's not it the right format, but you can probably use search/replace in your text editor to get it into the right format.
You need to turn this:
    {
        "tx_hash":"57ef38c8dc617d4f579081889261de6602989556b6cefe222d75002907adcbd7",
        "tx_hash_big_endian":"d7cbad072900752d22feceb65695980266de6192888190574f7d61dcc838ef57",
        "tx_index":28075810,
        "tx_output_n": 74,
        "script":"76a914a066eff71807b0387ea626ed34724cd897bc0bdb88ac",
        "value": 9520,
        "value_hex": "2530",
        "confirmations":238896
    },
into this:
    {
        "txid":"57ef38c8dc617d4f579081889261de6602989556b6cefe222d75002907adcbd7",
        "vout": 74
    },
for each output.
And if you don't have the utxo set, you'll need the "script" field in the blockchain.info output, and use it as the scriptPubKey when signing the raw tx. See OP for details.

Bitcoin is effectively a big ledger remembering which address owns each coin. Everyone running a node in the Bitcoin network has a full list of who owns each coin. We all agree with each other about who owns what, via the magic of mining.
When you have "coins in your wallet", all you really have is the private keys that you need to prove to the nodes that you own some coins. To spend some coins you sign a message using your private key, and all the miners can verify that the message was signed using the correct private key, and so they all update their ledger.
When you lose your private keys (by losing your hard drive, for instance) you lose your ability to sign messages, and so the coins will never change ownership again. They'll always be "yours", but you'll have no way of proving it and no way of spending them.

Each set of 3 words gives us 32 bits of entropy and 1 bit of checksum, yes.
Consider if the seed was only 3 words, and you revealed 2 of them.
3 words give up 32 bits of entropy, or 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 possibilities.
If you see any two of the words, only roughly half of the 2048 words in the wordlist make the checksum correct, meaning you've weakened the strength from 32 bits to 10 bits. ie. you're right. Well done! ;)

So the price is currently $900, say. There are people trying to buy for $899 and people trying to sell at $901.
I'm the exchange, and I want to make it look like the price is $1000. How do I do that without people realizing that I'm cheating? What do I do about the person who has an order in to sell at $901? When he sees that the price has moved up to $1000 he's going to expect that his order at $901 has been matched, that someone has paid $901 for his coin. He's going to expect to be able to withdraw that $901. The same goes for all the other sell orders between $900 and $1000 - they will all think their orders have been bought up. In effect the exchange has bought up all those orders and moved the price up. That's not cheating, and anyone can do it if they have enough dollars.
When the Willy Bot did this on Gox a few years back it used dollars that didn't exist; they were nothing more than entries in the Gox database. So the people it was buying from were unable to withdraw the dollars, and the exchange ended up declaring bankruptcy.

Can you explain your thinking? You're getting something wrong here because the expected waiting time to the next block is always around 10 minutes, not 5.


Well if we ignore the variance then the worst case is the same as the best case which is the same as the average case, which is indeed 10 minutes. Actually it's a little less due to the way that the difficulty targetting only happens every 2016 blocks, and the hashrate is generally increasing. But it's not much less.

Buying low and selling high reduces the volatility.
If you buy when it's low, you raise the price and if you sell when it's high you lower the price. Both of these actions reduce volatility.
It's the people who follow the crowd, selling after a crash or buying after a rally that cause the volatility.

If miners conspire to drop the difficulty by finding one block every 2.1 hours, it only takes them 1 day of doing that to drop the difficulty by a factor of 4. They could do this for 3 days and the difficulty would drop to 1/64th of its current level. Then they get to pretty much instamine 2016 blocks before the difficulty goes up, and when it does, it only goes up by a factor of 4. The next 2016 blocks go at 16 times the regular speed, taking around 1 day, and the next 2016 blocks go at 4 times the regular speed, taking around 3.5 days. So they've mined 6000 blocks in about 5 days, after deliberately mining slowly for 3 days. Average rate: 6000 blocks in 8 days. That's an average blocktime of less than 2 minutes. This can be continued indefinitely.
Other miners can try to prevent the difficulty drop by mining blocks during the 3 days that blocks are being mined slowly to lower the difficulty, but the conspiring miners can simply ignore their blocks if they're more than 51% of the hash rate, knowing that eventually their chain will be the most-work chain and so will orphan the other one.

Miners work for us, the same as the people who make our computers work for us. We pay them for the work they do.
Some miners recently seem to be thinking that they get to set the rules but they don't. They either enforce the rules or they don't get paid.

To understand the puzzles, you need to know about hash functions. If you already know what sha256 is, skip the next paragraph.
A hash is a one-way function. You've likely seen them when downloading programs online. You will often see a "checksum" next to the download link. You can run the .zip file or whatever through a checksum program after downloading it and compare the output with the checksum you saw on the download page to make sure it downloaded correctly. The checksum program is running a hash on the downloaded file. Changing any byte in the file will completely change the checksum (hash) that is generated. Bitcoin mining uses a well known hash function called [sha256](
So you're a miner, trying to get paid for making a block. You gather a bunch of unconfirmed transactions, create the block header using the previous block's hash, the current time, and a bunch of other stuff. One of the "bunch of other stuff" fields is called the "nonce". You can set it to any value you like. Then you hash the block you have created. The hash is a 64 character string of digits 0 through 9 and letters A through F. If the hash you get starts with 18 zeroes, congratulations. You have just mined a block. If not, change the nonce and try again. Changing the nonce will change the hash completely. Check again if it starts with 18 zeroes. It probably won't. Each character in the hash is one of 16 values (0-9, A-F), effectively "at random" (the hash function isn't at all random, but the output looks random), and you need 18 zeroes. That's a chance of 1 in 16^18, or 1 in 4 sextillion. On average you're going to have to try 4 sextillion different nonces before you successfully mine a block.
And that's all there is to it - repeating sha256 over and over again, as quick as you can, with slightly different inputs each time, trying to get an output that starts with enough zeroes.
Edit: [block 447000]( was recently mined. Its hash was `000000000000000000321ed453735fcebb83f38316405c451b30b5fe0215b293` as you can see in the top right of the linked page. [block 1]( was mined back in 2009. Its hash was `00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048`. Back in those days you only needed 8 zeroes...
More details: Bitcoin mining actually uses double-sha256: you run the block through sha256, then you run the output through sha256 again. Then you count the zeroes. And the "18 zeroes" is an approximation. The target actually changes every 2016 blocks (ie. every 2 weeks or so). If the last 2016 blocks took more than 2 weeks to be mined, the target is increased to make it easier and speed up the rate that blocks are found. If they took less than 2 weeks, the target is lowered to make it harder and increase the time it takes to find a block.
As for what happens if two blocks are found at the same time, each miner will mine on top of whichever block they saw announced on the network first. But they will also switch to the other block if it becomes the longest chain. Every block refers to the previous block in its header, forming a chain from each block to its parent. The Bitcoin consensus agrees that the "longest" chain is the valid chain, where "longest" means the chain with the most "work" done on it, and where "most work" is defined by the hash targets that each block in the chain was targeting.
So suppose all miners were working on block A, but then two of them solve blocks on top of A at the same time, B1 and B2. Some miners will start working on top of B1, others will start working on top of B2. Hopefully one of them will be the clear winner of that round. Say it's a miner working on top of B2. Then when he announces his new block, everyone sees that the A-&gt;B2-&gt;C chain he just announced is longer than the A-&gt;B1 chain, and so they switch to the A-&gt;B2-&gt;C chain.
Of course, it's possible that which half the network is working on top of B1 and half on top of B2, one miner from each side finds the next block at the same time as each other too, so we have two chains, A-&gt;B1-&gt;C1 and A-&gt;B2-&gt;C2. But pretty soon one side will "win", and everyone will switch to the winning chain.
Now the problem is that B1 could contain the transaction where I sent a Bitcoin to you, and B2 could contain the transaction where I sent *the same Bitcoin* to someone else. If your node saw B1 first, you would think that the transaction paying you was confirmed, but later, when C2 is mined, your node would switch to the chain with B2 in it, resulting in the conflicting payment being confirmed, and the transaction paying you would be left unconfirmed, and would never confirm again. This is why we recommend that you wait for 6 confirmations (so the transaction you care about is 'buried' 6 blocks deep), because then there is almost no chance that your transaction will be switched out.
Probably a bit long-winded, but I hope it made sense.

So the thief only had to go to the third party, say "I've forgotten my password", and they would email a password reset link to the thief.

I think one of the benefits of being a miner is that you get to decide which transactions to include in the blocks you mine. Maybe you have a deal with an exchange to include their transactions preferentially in exchange for them paying you a monthly fee. I don't see a problem with it.

They don't block anything. They just refuse to mine transactions paying to any of a list of addresses, and refuse to build on top of blocks which do mine those transactions.


I can't parse that sentence, sorry. What two things are you asking me to compare? One of them seems to be "they can juts block the ones for settling from the HUB nodes on LN, effectively shutting down that whole shitty system", and I don't see the other. Miners don't get to see individual transactions made on LN. They only see the transactions which open and close channels. They have no idea which end points sent or received coins.


It allows us to scale Bitcoin without bloating the blocks. It isn't possible to scale very far using on-chain transactions alone without enormous cost to decentalization. LN solves this by allowing the majority of transactions to move off-chain, improving their cost efficiency, time-efficiency, and privacy.
You sound a little angry, which may explain your difficulty in constructing a sentence. Perhaps take a while to calm down and try again?

No, SPV requires you to trust the node you are connecting to. SPV can't even tell whether the node is on the right chain or not. What if someone has forked the chain and increased the blocksize limit, or increased the rate of coin creation? Your SPV wallet wouldn't know, and would happily work with the new fork coin without warning you.
You can't check random blocks if you haven't checked the ones which come before it. It's a block *chain* for a reason.

When I manually craft transactions I don't get to specify the fee. I list the inputs and the outputs. The fee is implicit - it's the sum of the inputs minus the sum of the outputs.

I believe you're right on both counts. 40 cards from 52 have log(52!/12!,2) = 196.7 bits of entropy, and there are only 2^160 different addresses, and so only effectively 2^160 different groups of private keys that can spend from those addresses.
I expect Ian will fix his bip39 tool soon, based on how quickly he has reacted to previous issues I have raised.
Edit: note that 40 cards are taken into account only if you specify 52 cards; if you only specify 40 cards then less than 40 will be used, and so on. This is a bug that will need fixing.

It is possible to [export your private key]( (follow the 7 numbered steps at the end of that comment), so you can access your coins without their help. And the client side code is javascript, and so the source code is available by default - javascript is an interpreted language and so source code is all there is.
I should also mention that the blockchain.info wallet has been plagued with bugs and security problems in the past. I don't know how they're doing these days, but I wouldn't recommend using it for significant amounts of value.
I would personally keep a few coins on my phone so I could use them any time and the rest in cold storage, harder to access.

Weight is calculated as 4 for each byte in the base block plus 1 for each byte in the witnesses. Instead of a blocksize limit of 1 MB, we now have a block weight limit of 4 million.
So if it's a regular 1 MB block with no SegWit transactions, it'll have a weight of 4 million:
    1000k*4 + 0k * 1 = 4000k
If every transaction is half witness data, the 4 million weight limit means we'll have an 800 kB base block and 800 kB of witness data, giving us a 1.6 MB block:
    800k*4 + 800k*1 = 4000k
If every transaction is 1/3 base data and 2/3 witness data, a full block will have 666k of base data and 1333k of witness data, giving us a 2 MB block:
    666k*4 + 1333k*1 = 4000k

I think it is still possible to use covert ASICBOOST on the BTC chain if you are willing to only mine legacy transactions (ie. no SegWit inputs).

Transactions like buying coffee don't belong on a global blockchain which all validating users need to download. This is an application which would be better suited to some kind of offchain technology.

What if in the future the US government changed the rules such that they can take 30% of every transaction as tax. If their chain had the most work on it would that be Bitcoin? Are you saying that the rules can be changed by anyone with enough hash power? That doesn't sound right to me.

Block size increases are never exhausted. You just keep doubling the blocksize limit until almost nobody can run a full node any more. It's a bad idea.

The very first sentence is factually inaccurate:


Not true. There was always an option to mine or not to mine. I mined for a month and then stopped, since it was burning my lap to run the CPU all the time. After January 2011 my full node was very definitely a non-mining full node.


That's not true. If the majority of miners start mining invalid blocks, the exchanges and real users (the ones validating the blocks they accept) would reject those blocks. The dishonest miners have effectively resigned from the network and in time the difficulty would adjust, allowing the remaining honest miners to earn more coins per unit hashrate.


Not even that. We would simply reject their blocks. We can do this because we are running fully validating nodes.


My non-mining full node can't stop miners from resigning from the network and going to work on an altcoin. But it can detect when they do so, and reject their invalid blocks. That's the point. Miners don't get to set the consensus rules; they get to enforce them. If they don't enforce the consensus rules, they aren't mining Bitcoin. They're mining an altcoin, and my full node will reject their altcoin blocks.


No, that's not true. I will need to update my node software if I wish to switch to an altcoin. If I want to stick with Bitcoin I don't need to update anything.


"trusted mining full node" - I think you're missing the point. We aren't meant to be trusting third parties. If you want to have to trust third parties I would recommend using PayPal or some other centralized legacy system.


Zero confirmation transactions have never been safe, and never will be. Miners are under no obligation to mine the first version of a transaction they see. There is nothing to stop them mining a high-fee double-spend transaction even if it doesn't bear the "replace by fee" mark.


If there's a hard fork upgrade, by definition there is consensus for it, and so the people running full nodes would update their software. If instead there's a hard fork corporate takeover attack on the network, the full nodes won't update their software and will continue to operate on the Bitcoin network, unaffected by the malicious hard fork. This is a good thing.


That would be a problem. People might find themselves using B2Xcoin without even knowing it. It is a mistake to use SPV clients and trust that the miners won't switch to the wrong consensus rules without you knowing about it.


The same goes for corporate takeovers. It must be inconvenient to have people running their own full nodes getting in the way of big business co-opting Bitcoin. Why don't we all just trust you and let you twist Bitcoin any way you want to? Double the block rewards? Sure, don't even bother asking me if I'm OK with it - I'm just an SPV user after all. Roll-back transactions arbitrarily? Don't mind if you do. I won't even notice, I'm an SPV user.

It's not a future problem. The blockchain is already over 120 GB in size and growing quickly.
Bitcoin Core is able to prune nodes, deleting all blocks other than the most recently received N MB, for an N of your choosing. Of course, if you do that then you're not able to help other nodes get started.
My Bitcoin Cash full node is using pruning. I told it to keep just the most recent 600 MB of block data. My Bitcoin Core full node isn't using pruning. Here are the sizes of their block and chainstate directories, in MB:
    $ cd ~/.bitcoin &amp;&amp; du -sm blocks chainstate
    153118  blocks

The problem with that, assuming the price ends up over 1100 or below 900 for a long time is that you either end up selling too low or buying too high.
If the price goes up to 2000 and trades there for a year, he'll have sold at 1100 and miss out on a low of upside.
On the other hand if the price goes down to 100 and trades there for a year he'll have bought at 900 and lost most of his value.

Seems dodgy:

If the shared key is stored by Coinbase, how is the Coinbase key the only key that Coinbase stores? Seems to me that a simple replacement of the client side javascript code to pass your unencrypted shared key to their server would be enough for them to steal your coins.

* 0.00003885 BTC for economic (4 cents), 223 bytes, 17.4 sat/byte
* 0.00005180 BTC for normal (5 cents), 224 bytes, 23.1 sat/byte
* 0.00025900 BTC for priority (25 cents), 223 bytes, 116.1 sat/byte
The transactions were sent at 12:36pm.
No block was mined until 12:51pm. That block only contained the priority transaction; none of my transactions were confirmed in the next block, but the 3rd block confirmed two more of them. The 4th transaction wasn't mined for 57 more blocks, and took a total of 535 minutes to be mined.
In summary:
* low-priority - 2 cents : confirmed in the 60th mined block, after 535 minutes (5 minutes short of 9 hours)
* economic - 4 cents : confirmed in the 3rd mined block, after 20 minutes
* normal - 5 cents : confirmed in the 3rd mined block, after 20 minutes
* priority - 25 cents : confirmed in the first mined block, after 15 minutes

BIP143 defines a new transaction digest algorithm for signature verification in version 0 witness program. BCH doesn't have SegWit, so they don't really have BIP143. They took the BIP143 code and use it for all signatures and as a result fix the quadratic hashing problem.


It's "on the table" but not "in the code". That's why I said BCH doesn't fix malleability. Code does do anything if you leave it on a table.

What about 4x or 8x? Would you consider those to have validity also? If so, why? Are you willing to accept any arbitrary hard fork change to the rules?
We don't need to double the block size limit; it's just a play to weaken Bitcoin, and as such is just as malicious as the Bcash hardfork.
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:01:22
We pretty much assume they're using ASICBOOST already don't we? Why else did they block SegWit for so long?
Given that, they can either use ASICBOOST on the BTC chain, or use it on the BCH chain.
So why not use it on the more profitable chain? I doubt it's about saving face.

I don't know of any Bitcoin Core developer who supports the 2x hard fork.


I do support the original Bitcoin chain. I don't mine.
This isn't an election. Nobody has a vote.
Miners can decide whether to mine Bitcoin or an altcoin, but it's not an election.


I think you may have typed that wrongly. I can't understand it. Maybe "because" should be "becomes" and "dominate" should be "dominant"? But that doesn't make sense - you'd be saying "BCH will be the dominant chain if Bitcoin becomes the dominant chain", which is self-contradictory. So I'm a bit stuck.
I think it's possible that a large percentage of the miners support the B2X coin initially, but I think they'll switch back to mining Bitcoin when they realize they can't sell their B2X coins for very much money.

From the release notes:


I'm wondering whether the wallet is smart enough to notice that different addresses can have the same public key. For instance, an attacker could send dust to the bech32 version of every p2sh-wrapped segwit address which has been spent from (and to the p2sh-wrapped segwit address version of every bech32 address which has been spent from). If the wallet doesn't notice that the bech32 address and the p2sh-wrapped segwit addresses have the same public keys it wouldn't mark the dust utxo as address reuse.
Edit: I posted an issue in the Bitcoin github about this:  - it turns out the wallet doesn't notice when a pubkey is used to create a same-but-different address, and so the chain-analysis people won't be slowed down by this "avoid_reuse" feature at all.

It sounds like SegWit is likely to be exactly what you want then. That should give us roughly 2MB blocks as well as fixing transaction malleability and other bugs. The S2X guys want SegWit (which doubles the block size) and a doubling of the blocksize limit, which together gives us 4MB blocks (which your own instinct tells you is currently too big).


Of course. If we ever need a hard fork for bigger blocks I'm sure it will happen. We just don't need it yet. As you say, let's see how LN works out

Sure it does. It's one million bytes. If you make a block with a base size bigger than that all the Bitcoin nodes will reject it. That's what caused the hard fork recently.


Not without hard forking it can't.


No we haven't. Other than fixing a bug due to a previously unknown limitation regarding the maximum number of locks available in the Berkeley DB system all changes have been soft forks, ie. backwards compatible.


This is different. It's a hard fork, breaking compatibility will all existing clients.

No, you're thinking of the PIN.
There are two separate ideas: the PIN and the passphrase.
The PIN controls access to the hardware wallet, but has no effect on the private keys themselves. If I find your 12 word seed phrase written down I don't need your PIN. I can put your 12 word seed into a new wallet and spend your coins. If I find your hardware wallet, I need to guess the PIN, and each time I get it wrong the delay between retries increases exponentially.
The passphrase actually changes the addresses and private keys. You can think of it as a 13th seed word. If I find your 12 word seed phrase but don't know your passphrase I'm going to have to brute force it.
You can use a PIN and a passphrase together.

Loans aren't compounded, and interest isn't paid until the loan closes. They also charge something like 20% fees I think, though I could be wrong about that.
The shortest you can offer a loan for is 2 days, but the borrower can repay the loan as soon as he wants. You as the lender are committed to the full term of the loan, but the borrower isn't. So you end up making lots of 10 minute loans, and that way the interest *does* compound, since loan 1's interest can be included in the amount loaned out by loan 2.

It would be possible to implement a Bitcoin-funded debit card system such that every transaction made with the card translated to a transaction on the Bitcoin network, but I doubt that's how they actually work. I expect they have user balances in a plain old relational database and use a shared wallet for all users.
Each LN transaction results in real valid Bitcoin transactions being in the hands of the transacting parties, and those parties have the option of broadcasting those transactions to the network to close the LN channel.
While it isn't strictly true to say that LN transctions *are* Bitcoin transactions, each LN transaction results in the creation of Bitcoin transactions. Which is possibly close enough, depending on the point you're trying to make.

Each transaction takes one or more unspent outputs and spends them to make one or more new unspent outputs.
Each of the new outputs can go to any address you like. It is recommended that you never use the same address twice but there's nothing to stop you doing so in practice.


They use wallet software. The wallet keeps track of which addresses it owns and which unspent outputs exist at those addresses. To the user it looks like a single balance.


It is possible. Just pick any address in your wallet and publish that. But it isn't recommended, for at least two reasons:
1) It damages your privacy. People will know that the address is yours and be able to identify your transactions much more easily than if you used a different address for each donation.
2) When you spend your first donation, you publish the public key corresponding to your donation address. Until then all anyone know was a 160-bit hash of that public key. If there is a weakness in the cryptography Bitcoin uses it will be much easier to steal from addresses with known public keys than from others. In short, spending from an address theoretically weakens the security of other outputs at the same address.


If you only ever use a single address, then yes.


2FA is used when a third party is wanting to verify that it's really you before acting on your behalf. "Bitcoin Wallet" is software running locally on your phone. It knows your private key already. There's no third party you need to convince.
I would recommend taking a look at Mycelium in the Play Store. It uses a different address for each transaction, making it harder for people to figure out your balance. You still have the problem of how to communicate donation addresses to people so they don't all use the same one. I remember the concept of "stealth addresses" was introduced to work around the problem but I don't think it really ever caught on. Dark Wallet supported it, but that hasn't been updated in a while.
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:55:06
You mean it won't have replay *protection*? That just means we need to protect ourselves from transaction replay:
* one chain will be longer than the other; we can use `locktime` to make a transaction that can only confirm after a certain block number, making it invalid on the slower chain for a while, then double-spend it on the slower chain
* one chain will have higher fees than the other; we can use a RBF-enabled transaction which has too-low of a fee to confirm on the expensive chain, then once it has confirmed on the cheaper chain we can RBF-replace it with a different transaction that will confirm on the more expensive chain
* failing that, we can combine our coins with an output that has already been safely split, or which is derived from a block reward created after the fork.
tl;dr: there are lots of ways of protecting ourselves from replay attacks if we know what we're doing.
Edit: also, exchanges probably won't even list the coin if it doesn't have replay protection, so the B2X guys will likely have to back down on their "no replay protection" stance if they want exchanges to help them at all.

Miners choose which transactions to include in a block, and which blocks to build on top of.
If a 51% miner didn't want you to receive any money they could ignore all transactions sending coins to your address and orphan any blocks which contain transactions paying you.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:34:47
Their blocks would be rejected and orphaned by the majority who were enforcing the soft fork.
[Edit: because those old miners would follow the longest valid chain - and they would see the chain of hard blocks mined by the majority as being valid. The new miners (ignoring EDA) wouldn't see the easier chain as valid at all, according to the new rule.]
It's the same as what would happen to any miners who fail to enforce the SegWit rules after the SegWit soft fork went live. According to the pre-SegWit consensus rules it's fine to ignore the new SegWit rules, but since the majority of miners are enforcing SegWit rules, and block which breaks them will be orphaned by the majority.
Even if the majority stops enforcing SegWit rules, the economic majority nodes (exchanges, etc.) will reject any blocks which break the SegWit rules, so the miners are strongly incentivized to enforce them.

I understand that it is counter-intuitive, but whether you send your transaction immediately after a block is found or wait 5 minutes after a block is found and then send your transaction, your average waiting time until the next block is still 10 minutes. It seems crazy doesn't it, but it's true.
In a somewhat related matter if you wait for a roulette game to come up red 5 times in a row before betting on black you have no better chance of winning as if you just walk up to the table and bet on black immediately. Bitcoin mining (much like a roulette wheel) has no memory. Past successes don't affect the probability of future successes (other than by adjusting the difficulty every 2 weeks or so).


I have done this in the past. I got about 9.5 minutes. Have you tried it?
[Edit: I just tried this again, picking random times between the time of block 440000 and the time of block 449550. After repeating 1000 times I saw an average of 549.28 seconds to the previous block and 556.17 seconds to the next block. Continuing on to a million samples the average became more stable at 552.95 seconds to the previous block and 552.87 seconds to the next block, for a total of 18.4 minutes between blocks. Note that the time of block 440000 is 1479777904 and the time of block 449550 is 1485117548 ([UNIX time]( That's 9550 blocks in 5339644 seconds, for an average of 559.12 seconds per block - pretty close to the average time to next and previous blocks I saw by sampling random points in time as you suggested. I can publish my work if you're interested to see it.]
If you pick a random point in time, the average time to the next block is 10 minutes, the average time to the previous block is also 10 minutes, and the average time between the previous and the next block is 20 minutes.

I thought I remembered reading somewhere that this would download the whole blockchain, and *then* prune it, and so you would still need a big enough hard drive to store the whole lot.
So I tried it, and found that it's not true. It deletes the block information not long after downloading each block. I'm not quite done syncing the whole chain yet (10k blocks left to go), but my disk usage is as follows (in MB):
    68	./blocks/index
    588	./blocks
    2873	./chainstate

ie. only 588 MB of raw block data, and less than 3 GB of utxo information ("chainstate"). The 3477 MB is the total of the whole .bitcoin directory, including the debug.log log file.

I believe there is more user support for Bitcoin than for hard forks of Bitcoin. If users wanted bigger blocks and didn't want SegWit, why is nobody using the BCash fork? There is very little real demand for bigger blocks.


The Core developers are focused on the security of Bitcoin. While increasing the blocksize may eventually be necessary it certainly isn't yet. SegWit itself was a big compromise in that it more than doubles the maximum growth rate of the blockchain.


Seems pretty arbitrary.


Yes, but the thing being voted on is specifically "out of all the **valid** chains, which one is the "real" one. Any chain containing a block with a base size over 1 MB isn't a valid block, for example.
That, any only that, is what miners get to "vote" on with their hash power. They don't get to vote in the "shall we change the rules" election with their hash power.


Yes. You misunderstood what election was being discussed.


I disagree. You're saying "if BTC beats B2X like it beat BCH then BCH will win". I don't see how that follows. What if the users don't want bigger blocks at the expense of increased centralization?


Exchanges don't value anything. Users value things. The exchanges merely host markets which reflect what the users value.
Maybe that's what you meant. If so, I simply disagree. I don't think the users want bigger blocks. I think they prefer to keep Bitcoin as secure as possible. That's done by having it developed by developers with a proven track record, and by putting security rather than popularity first.


Yes. Time will tell.


Hashpower will follow price, and price follows the users.

First off, you haven't lost anything other than the 0.1136402 BTC that was double-spent on you.
I would recommend using a better wallet than blockchain.info's offering. Ideally one that allows you to tell it not to attempt to spend unconfirmed coins. Definitely one that doesn't attempt to spent coins which will definitely never confirm - that's just crazy behavior on b.i's part.
If it was me I would export the private keys from blockchain.info's wallet, import them in Bitcoin Core, and spend them from there. You probably don't have a synced up copy of Bitcoin Core, and it can take quite a long time to sync the blockchain, so maybe you don't want to go that route. If you do, let me know and I'll walk you through it.
Alternatively, if you're willing to trust me with your coins I can move them to a new address for you. But of course I understand if you're wary of doing that.

So is the communication all one-way, or can you request specific blocks from the satellite? I use a geo-stationary satellite for my Internet connection, so I know it's possible to have two-way communication with them.
If it's one-way, will the satellite be continuously broadcasting the whole blockchain in order, and I have to wait for it to broadcast the block I'm waiting for? I guess it will broadcast newly found blocks preferentially, but maybe not. Where can I read about such details?

If a miner wants to continue using covert AB after SegWit activates, he will have to avoid mining any SegWit transactions, yes. That may mean he loses out on a bunch of fees, because a) he won't be able to collect any fees from SegWit transactions and b) non-SegWit transactions are typically bigger, so he'll be able to fit less of them into a block.

The coins go to their deposit addresses and then on to either the exchange's cold storage address or used to fund withdrawals by other exchange users. The majority of exchange users with a non-zero balance on the exchange have a zero balance in their deposit address.
Many people who would consider themselves to be Bitcoin owners don't have any coins at an address for which they control the private key, or even at a unique address for which a third party controls the private key. The coins tend to clump together in cold storage addresses where thousands of users coins are all at the same address.
Edit: of course, some in the community wouldn't consider those people to be using Bitcoin at all, telling them "if you don't have the private key you don't have the Bitcoin".

You're confused. Hard forks require 100% adoption to prevent a split. Soft forks only require a simple majority.
This is how the Bitcoin chain could adopt SegWit (a soft fork) without a chain split despite lacking 100% support whereas BCH (a hard fork) couldn't increase the block size limit without splitting the chain.

I'm telling you people buy BTC on exchanges, send them straight to dice sites, then on to other dice sites or sports books. Sometimes they win and send their coins back to an exchange to "cash out" for "real money". Sometimes they leave their coins "invested" in the bankroll of a crowd-funded casino where it tends to grow slowly (but sometimes shrinks or is stolen).
At no point in this use case is a local wallet found to be necessary. When gamblers do find it necessary to use a wallet they seem to mostly opt for blockchain.info's wallet service (again, in my experience - I've not done any real research into it).

Dollar cost averaging will give you some kind of average price over some future time period, compared to buying right now, which gives you the price right now.
Whatever strategy you pick will give you a single average price. You need to decide whether you think the current price is higher than the average price will be over the coming months.
I would recommend making several smaller purchases rather than a single large one, but that's just because of the risk of theft or error. Suppose you send your $10k to an exchange and the exchange gets hacked. You may have lost the whole $10k. If instead you send them $1k, exchange for BTC, and withdraw to your own local wallet, then repeat - then the most you're risking to an exchange hack is $1k. You have reduced your risk by a factor of 10 (which extending the risk period by a factor of 10). I would rather have a 1% chance of losing $1k than a 0.1% chance of losing $10k; even though the expected loss is the same in both cases the variance is smaller in the first case.

I think the Bitcoin Core estimator is very conservative. It tells you how much you should pay to have a 95% chance of getting into the target block.
I don't care how long I have to wait for my transaction to confirm, and so I don't care about having a 95% chance. But in practice I find that 10 satoshis per byte is plenty to get confirmed within a few hours. Even though Bitcoin Core tells me that I should be paying 60 satoshis per byte or more.

I would rather use real dice than trust bitaddress to generate a random key.
And rather than creating a bunch of unrelated addresses I would recommend using an HD wallet (BIP32/39/44). Then you only need to remember one 12 word seed and get infinitely many addresses each with their own private key.
See  for a page that will work offline to generate you a 12 word seed, or  for a modified version of that site that allows you to provide your own randomness instead.

I'm not sure that gives you a lower expected price than just buying now, does it?
If you're looking to buy BTC as an investment then presumably you're expecting the price to go up. In that case why would you wait rather than buying now? Maybe tomorrow the price is $100 more than it is today and you've missed out on the current 'low low prices'... Of course it's possible that tomorrow the price is lower than today, but if you think the price is headed downwards then maybe it's not a good investment anyway.

Of course. If the blocks ever are full there will be a much higher chance of getting consensus for a hard fork.

Bitcoins don't have physical locations. You don't need to (and cannot) move them from one country to another.
In order to control the movement of Bitcoins from one address to another you only need to know the private key of the address they are currently in. That information can be stored in a wallet file, on a piece of paper, in a hardware wallet, or in your head. If you can move that information from South Africa to Ireland you have effectively "moved the Bitcoin".

Don't worry about any of that. If they're selling BTC for $331 then buy! You can sell them elsewhere for $4600 or so.
But seriously, all that chart is showing you is the volume available to buy and sell at each price. The red side is flat at the bottom, meaning that buying even a little will push the price up from 331.50 to 332.90. The green side is steep at the bottom, meaning there's a decent amount trying to buy at 331.45, so you can dump around 20 BTC into it without dropping the price.
Naively this would suggest that the price will move up in the short term, because there's more buy pressure than sell pressure. But you don't know if that buy wall is real, or if it will be pulled as soon as someone starts selling into it. People have been known to put up "fake" buy/sell walls to move the market.

That's the misunderstanding. It isn't the longest chain that matters (the dogecoin chain is longer than the bitcoin chain - that doesn't mean doge is now bitcoin). It's the longest *valid* chain that matters. As in the longest chain that is accepted by Bitcoin nodes.
The Bitcoin consensus rules reject blocks bigger than 1 MB, and there is so far no consensus to change those rules. And so any chain containing blocks bigger than 1 MB isn't valid, and so isn't "Bitcoin".

The EDA only ever makes the difficulty lower. If the majority of miners ignored the EDA rule, they would be mining at a difficulty that is the same as or harder than the legacy nodes are requiring. So any block mined by the majority of miners would be accepted by the legacy nodes, so long as the majority used the correct nBits in their block header, representing the difficulty according to the EDA rather than the new, harder, non-EDA difficulty.
So all the majority needs to do to remove the EDA rule is to pretend the EDA rule doesn't exist for the purposes of mining, and validating blocks, and only use the EDA to set the nBits in their block headers.

I had never seen GDAX before today. I took a look to answer your question. It looks a lot like a bunch of other sites though.
The red and grey lines will be [moving averages]( I don't see any information about them, but they will both be some kind of average of the price over the last so many periods. One will be over a longer period than the other.
Some people use them to know when to buy or sell. I'm hazy on the details, and suspect that it's probably nonsense, but I think the theory goes that when the two lines cross we have seen a trend reversal, and so you should switch from buying to selling, or vice versa.
Looking at the "1h" chart (use the 2nd dropdown menu to change the time scale) we see that the lines crossed about 36 hours ago, so that's when you should have sold your coins. When they cross again, you should buy... The problem is, if you change to the "1d" chart you'll see that the lines haven't crossed yet - red is still on top, and so you shouldn't have sold yet.
The grey bars at the bottom represent volume. I don't see a scale, so they just give you an idea of the volume of each period relative to the other periods. Or you can hover the mouse over them and see the "V" number in the top right.
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:52:45
When I send you a Bitcoin, I create a transaction and sign it using my private key. You can verify that the transaction is correctly signed, and so can be sure that I really did authorize the transaction.
What you cannot know is whether I created another transaction which sends *the same Bitcoin* to another person. Because if I did, I wouldn't show it to you.
This is known as the "double spend" problem, and until Bitcoin nobody know of a way of solving it without the use of a central authority. If I have to send all of my transactions to The Bank for them to "count", then my trickery would be detected by the bank. The bank would presumably only honor whichever transaction they saw first. When they see my trying to spend the same Bitcoin a second time they would reject it.
But we want to get away from central authorities. So how do we detect double-spends? That was satoshi's genius. He came up with the idea of mining.
Everyone who wants to try mining is free to do so. The Bitcoin users broadcast their signed transactions to the network. The miners collect them up, verify that they are correctly signed, not spending coins they aren't entitled to spend, not creating coins out of thin air, etc. then bundle them into blocks of 1 megabyte or less, add in some headers (the current time, a reference to the previous block, assorted other stuff) and try to find a "proof of work". That last step is the hard bit - the bit people refer to as "solving a math problem" or whatever.
The proof of work exists to make it hard to create a block. We don't want just anyone to be able to make a block whenever they want without any trouble, or people would just be doing it all the time. It's worth 12.5 BTC (around $11k or some such) for each time you do it, after all.
So all the miners are constantly working to find a solution. The difficulty is automatically adjusted such that a solution is found on average once every 10 minutes. As soon as a miner finds a solution they publish it to the world and earn their 12.5 BTC. At that point all the transactions they bundled into their block are considered "confirmed". All the miners see that the current block has been solved, and once they have checked that the new block followed all the rules correctly they will start working on the next one, bundling up a new set of unconfirmed transactions.
Miners know that their block won't be accepted by anyone else if it contains any double-spends, so they won't include any conflicting transactions in their block.
In this way the whole world quickly settles upon a single unified view of the state of things.
So when I send you a Bitcoin, you can't be sure that I haven't sent the same coin to someone else. But when you see the transaction in a block on the blockchain you can be pretty sure that the coins are now yours. To be extra sure, you will wait until a few more blocks have been built on top of the block containing the transaction I sent you. Once the transaction is 6 blocks deep in the chain it is generally considered to be set in stone.
Does that help? It's hard to know where to go into details and what details to skip. I didn't talk at all about what the 'mathematical problem' actually is, or what happens if two miners solve a block at the same time, for instance.

It's funny that you asked about this.
I've been talking the author of [this BIP39 tool]( into doing the conversion the other way around for a while now.
I want to be able to shuffle a deck of cards and type the resulting order into a tool and have it generate a BIP39 seed deterministically from the shuffled deck. My intention was to avoid having to use a possibly unreliable pseudo-random number generator - I trust my shuffling ability more than I trust a computer's ability to be random.
Your goal seems to be different; you've already got a seed and want to use a deck of cards to make a backup of the seed in a non-obvious way.
One caveat: the tool linked above has been changing quite a bit recently. Don't rely on it continuing to create the same seed from a deck of cards in the future. The exact choice of algorithm to do so seems to still not be entirely set in stone.

He's saying that "everyone would be better off as a result" of people not running a full node to validate their own transactions. I'm disagreeing.
I understand that lots of people are trusting a third party to validate their transactions for them, but really they are missing the point. You would be better off if you stopped trusting the people who run Trezor's nodes and started trusting your own node. Much the same as how you're better off using Bitcoin instead of PayPal, even if PayPal don't ever actually target you for account freezes and closures. You're better off because you avoid the risk of PayPal targetting you. And you avoid the risk of Trezor turning rogue and having their node lie to you about your BTC holdings.

One thing to be aware of is that you don't only have to trust the exchange. Tether itself could fail. I don't know what kind of guarantee there is if any that you will be able to sell your USDT tokens for $1 each.

Unfortunately not. There are several different schemes for getting from the phrase to the private keys.
Lots are compatible with each other, using BIP44 (Mycelium, Trezor, Copay, and probably others). Some are totally incompatible with every other wallet (Electrum, Bitcoin Core). Others are compatible with a small subset of wallets (Hive and Breadwallet, for example). It's a mess.

I received a PM about this comment of mine, saying:


I'll waffle on about each of the three methods I outlined. I don't know how to split text into paragraphs while in a numbered list, so apologies for the ugly wall-of-text appearance:
1. After a split, the miners decide which of the two sides to mine on. One side will probably have more miners that the other side, so it will grow faster. Every transaction we make has a field called its `locktime`, which can be used to [prevent it being mined]( until some time in the future. Each transaction input also has a field called `sequence`. If all transaction inputs have a sequence of 0xffffff then the locktime of the transaction is ignored. Otherwise if the locktime is less than 500000000 it is interpreted as a block number at which the transaction can be mined, and if it's greater than or equal to 500000000 it is interpreted as a UNIX time (seconds since 1970) at which the transaction becomes valid.  
So segwit2x is apparently [going to fork at block 494,784]( Suppose an hour later it's at block 494785 and the real Bitcoin chain is at block 494790. We could make a transaction sending some of our coins to ourselves with a locktime of 494789. That transaction will be able to be mined immediately on the real chain, but not on the s2x chain. Once it confirms on the real chain you can make another transaction spending the same outputs on the s2x chain, without the locktime. Since the first transaction is still invalid on the s2x chain for 4 more blocks, the 2nd transaction is likely to confirm there. Now you've split those coins, and have two outputs, one which is only valid on the real chain and one which is only valid on the s2x chain. You can later use these split outputs to split more coins, using the 3rd method below.
Here's a post showing how to make a timelocked transaction using Bitcoin Core:  - I'm escrowing a bet, and wanted the players to be able to get their money back if I got hit by a bus. So I made transactions which they can use in a couple of years.
2. The main Bitcoin chain is often full of spam from big block supporters who are trying to make it look like we need bigger blocks by filling the 1 MB blocks up with garbage. Since miners are free to pick which transactions they put into blocks, and since they get to keep the transaction fees from the transactions they put into blocks, they are incentivized to select whichever transactions offer the highest fee per byte of transaction size. This tends to cause the fees to be bid upward on the main Bitcoin chain, and we end up paying 100 or 200 satoshis per byte for our transactions. Presumably on the s2x chain with double the blocksize limit there will be lower fees since each block can have twice as many transactions. Currently if you send a transaction paying 10 satoshis per byte on the regular Bitcoin chain, it will sit unconfirmed for hours. It's possible that 10 satoshis per byte would be enough to get it into one of the s2x chain's bigger blocks. So send some coins to yourself with a fee of 10 satoshis per byte, hope it confirms on the big-block chain and not on the Bitcoin chain, then once it does, send it again with a bigger fee so that it confirms on the Bitcoin chain too. Changing the fee changes the transaction ID, so you've now split your coins, and have outputs you can use in method 3 below to split more coins. There's a flag on transactions which says whether they are "replace by fee" or not. Generally if a miner sees two transactions trying to spend the same output, they are meant to only accept the first one they see and ignore any double-spend attempts. But if the first one they see is tagged "RBF" (replace-by-fee), that means they should switch to whichever one has the highest fee-per-byte. None of this is enforced by consensus rules, and miners are free to do whatever they want. There's no real incentive for miners to ignore a higher-fee transaction even if it isn't marked RBF, but if you're sending a low-fee transaction and hope to later replace it with  higher fee transaction, it's a good idea to mark it 'RBF'.
Bitcoin Core's `sendtoaddress` command has a field called `replaceable` which can be used to mark a transaction as RBF.
3. Once you have a single split output (which you can get using 1. or 2. above), you can make new transactions combining a split output with any of your other coins, and be safe in the knowledge that the new transaction isn't replayable. Since the split output you're spending is only valid on one of the chains, the new transaction and its outputs are also only valid on one of the chains. Just make sure to always include a split output in the transactions you make, and make sure to send some change back to yourself so you don't find yourself without any split outputs. Be aware that people sending you payments may not be replay-aware, and so new outputs you receive after the fork may need splitting to avoid replay attacks.

In my experience 'slag' and 'slut' are pretty interchangeable meaning something like "a promiscuous woman".

The question was pretty ambiguous. "Use" to spend, receive, or hold?
I would rather receive Bitcoin than cash. It tends to hold its value better and is easier to secure.

True. But that doesn't change the relative profitability of the two chains for you. It doesn't matter what the other miners are doing. All that matters for you when choosing a chain to work on is the difficulty, and the (future) price.
It doesn't even change the relatively profitability of the two chains for the ASICBOOST miners, since they can use their cheat on both chains.

Blocks mined by legacy (pre-segwit) miners are fully valid to other legacy miners, and even to segwit miners so long as they don't (unknowingly) break any of the new segwit rules.
In the same way, after a soft fork removing the EDA rule, a block mined by an original BCH miner would be accepted by all the other BCH miners who didn't drop the EDA rule, and even by the new (sans EDA) miners, so long as proof-of-work was hard enough to satisfy the new increased difficulty (ie. didn't accidentally break the new "no-EDA" rule).


No, that's not true. You also need to not break any of the segwit rules, or the majority of the miners will orphan your block. To a pre-segwit miner, segwit outputs look as if they don't need a signature to spend them. So if someone makes a transaction attempting to spend a segwit output without providing a signature, the pre-segwit miner will see it as a valid transaction and will mine it into a block. That block will be orphaned.


That's your second misunderstanding. While it is indeed the longest chain that matters, length isn't measured in blocks, it's measured in work done. Although in this particular case maybe you're right, because the work done is calculated from the nBits in the block header, which will be the same on both chains.

OK, I think we're getting to the core of our disagreement.
I think that LN transactions *are* exactly well-formed Bitcoin transactions. Why do you think they are not?
I don't know what an SU carburetor is, sorry. Car analogies are like cars. They break down.
Assuming it's just a part of the car, then I'd say it isn't the car itself. What about the car without the part in it? You'd still say that's the car. So then what if you remove part by part from a full car until all that's left is the SU carburetor? At some point it's gone from being a car to not being a car. At which point? I'm not sure where you're going with this, but it sounds like you might be trying to make a slippery slope argument - but it doesn't work here because the LN transaction itself *is* a fully valid Bitcoin transaction that you could broadcast to the network and have confirmed. Maybe you need to wait a while for a timeout, but it's still a valid transaction.

Well, you asked me


and I was answering your question. It depends how the debit card system is implemented, but probably not. My point was to answer your question.


It could, but you would have no guarantee that the transactions that you didn't get confirmed would even have been valid. They could be double-spends of other "only on paper" transactions. I could be making these paper transactions to 10 diffferent recipients using the same unspent output for all of them, and the 'recipients' would never know unless they tried broadcasting their transactions.
LN fixes that problem. You know that your "on paper only" transaction is valid without having to tie up space on the blockchain for every payment. As you said, you only need to broadcast the transactions which open and close the channel.
@_date: 2016-11-01 06:14:16
By that definition an unconfirmed transaction isn't a transaction, which is kind of ridiculous. An unconfirmed transaction necessarily hasn't been collected into a block.

I don't think that is the case. Do you have a reason to believe that?
If it were the case how is it able to allow you to make a backup of your seed words at any time? How is it able to sign any transactions using your private keys? Either the keys aren't encrypted, or they are encrypted but the encryption key is stored in plain text alongside the encrypted keys, which is effectively the same as not having them encrypted.
All I know is that I don't need to enter a passphrase to spend my coins, so the keys can't be very safely encrypted.

It's not possible in general to know which addresses are in which wallet(s).
If you're asking about addresses, most addresses have never been used. So the median number of Bitcoins per address is exactly zero.
However you define your question, the answer is either unknowable or meaningless.
If I have 100 BTC split between 100 paper wallets, or 100 BTC in a single paper wallet what is the median amount of BTC in my wallets? 1 or 100? Does it matter?
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:46:34
It's easy to get BTC onto exchanges, and impossible to get BCH on there. So the little BCH that's there gets bid up.
Once the difficulty drops on the BCH chain, which will happen in the next 4 to 10 blocks the blocks should start coming more quickly, making it easier to get coins onto the exchanges to dump.

They added a new rule that will reduce the difficulty by 20% every time the tip's median time is more than 12 hours later than the 6th block before the tip's median time.
In other words the difficulty will start going way down in about 4 blocks from now. They just need someone to work on those 4 blocks at a loss...

Well, the old clients would never generate a bc1 address, and so wouldn't see any payment to a bc1 address as a payment to themselves.
But no validation is done on output scripts. You can sent BTC to any output script you like. It doesn't have to correspond to an address, it can be any arbitrary script. The client will make sure that the sum of the output amounts doesn't exceed the sum of the input amounts, but that's all.
For example, I could send some BTC to an output script which is only spendable by someone who can provide a number whose SHA256 hash is 47. Such a number probably exists, but it's likely it will never be found. Old clients would accept the transaction as would a new one, but neither would claim to 'own' the output.

B2X wants to kill the Bitcoin chain and take over the brand. That's why they don't want replay protection. They want existing SPV wallets to make transactions which will be valid on the B2X chain, so that naive SPV users will automatically switch to their corporate takeover chain without the users even knowing what has been done to them.
I understand the motivation, but that doesn't make it any less evil, or any more legal.

What did I do? I accidentally forked the dogecoin chain one time by sending an amount that one version of the client thought was OK but which another version rejected.

Calling it "risk-free" when in fact 100% of your deposit is at risk and has to be played 15 times over is not really a misinterpretation. It's more like an outright lie.
Obviously it's fine to have terms against cheating. But your terms are vague enough that they could be used to disqualify anyone from getting their refund.
I have been denied a bonus before because other people from the same province used the same bonus. The province is bigger than most US states, so people being from the same province really shouldn't be grounds for disqualification. But what could I do?
I'd prefer if the terms and conditions were clearer.

Hashes are hexidecimal. There are 16 different characters, not 36. Did you ever see a hash that started with a G? Me neither.
And it's not right to say that you will need at most 36 inputs. By your logic to get 'tails' when flipping a coin you need to flip at most twice. As if it's impossible to flip heads twice in a row.


Not true. You could find 46,656 which all start with something other than 000. It's not very likely, due to your earlier mistake of confusing 16 with 36, but it's possible.


About 9% of the time you will get 37 hashes in a row that start with something other than 0.
I just tried this, and the first 37 unique strings I tried hashing all came out starting with something other than a "0". I used sha256, and hashed "a0", "a1", "a2", etc.

I think it's 500 payment channels. Or more.
Each channel has 2 end points, so if every end point of every channel is a different user 1000 users will need 500 channels. But some users will be the end point of more than one channel, meaning we'll need more than 500 channels.
In your example you have 3 users and 2 channels. ie. the number of channels is more than half the number of users.

That's what the Ethereum devs thought when they tried to "upgrade" Ethereum to claw back some of their coins that they put into a bad investment. A year later there are still two coins as the chain they tried to kill lives on.


How do you work that out?
I would have thought that with 25% of the hashpower you would find blocks at 25% the rate we currently do, and so the 2 week adjustment period would take 8 weeks instead.


I know, but the exchanges do.

I've looked at how the site works in the past and like the idea of it. My only problem with it is that there's a single point of failure, in that there's only one copy of my super important encrypted page.
Ideally the site would be distributed and use a blockchain so that if passphrase.io goes down there are many other copies of it hosting the same encrypted data.
Has anyone done something like this? I'm aware of "bitcoin graffiti" type sites where you can get your plain text strings put into the Bitcoin blockchain, but haven't heard of anything which combines that with encryption.

I prefer  for most purposes. It gives you an HD wallet seed phrase, so you get an infinite number of addresses from a single seed, helping you avoid address reuse and/or issues with managing multiple private key backups.

I think it's only a problem if you use the same R twice.
I have [an address]( with over 1000 BTC worth of CLAM in it. I sign a transaction with it about once per minute. So far I have used it to sign 43547 transactions.
Can you interpolate and find the private key?


I think these days R isn't random at all. It is deterministic, based on the `txid:vout`s of the inputs you are spending and so there's no need to worry about RNGs.

The puzzle is just a brute force search through a huge space for a number that has a certain property. Nobody knows the solution in advance. The only way to find the solution is by trial and error. It is possible to get extremely lucky and find the solution quickly, but it is much more likely that it is going to take a whole lot of guesswork to find a solution.
The network automatically adjusts the difficulty of the puzzle such that the whole world combined finds just one solution every ten minutes on average.
Each time someone finds a solution a new block is made. The person finding the solution gets a financial reward (currently 12.5 BTC) and the rest of us get our transactions confirmed, securing the network against fraud.


What do you mean by "bitcoins are growing"? The number of them? The value per unit? The total market cap?
The total market cap is around $12 billion. That's a drop in the ocean compared to the size of a country's economy.
The number of Bitcoins in existence is currently 16 million, with 12.5 new ones being created every 10 minutes. That's currently a 4.1% inflation rate. Each 4 years the rate of creation halves and the number in existence constantly increases, so the rate of inflation constantly decreases. No more than 21 million BTC will ever be created.


As more energy is dedicated to mining, the difficulty of mining increases to counterbalance it. One block is mined every 10 minutes on average no matter how hard people try. The halving of the block reward every 4 years ensures that there will never be more than 21 million BTC. A far cry from "infinite money".

Instead of stamping a 51 character private key, how about stamping the first 4 letters of each of your 12 seed words for an HD wallet? Then you have backed up an infinite number of private keys and don't have to keep reusing the same address.
BIP39's wordlist was chosen such that each of the 2048 words has a unique 4 character start. That's the case for the English wordlist anyway. I'm not seeing a German one anywhere.

No, 1800 are mined each day at the moment. You forgot to multiply by 12.5. 144 is the number of blocks per day, but there are 12.5 BTC created in each block at the moment:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 6*24*12.5
    1800.0


The block reward halves every 4 years, so it really takes pretty much forever to mine the full 21 million. It's only 12.5 BTC per 10 minutes for another 3 years, then it's 6.25 BTC per 10 minutes, then 3.125, etc.


We already do. Each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million pieces, known as satoshis. 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC. You can buy a fraction of a BTC; you don't have to deal in whole numbers.


I don't understand your questions. We don't know who created Bitcoin. He/they called themself Satoshi Nakamoto, but it's almost certainly a pseudonym. There was no pre-mine.


144 blocks of 12.5 BTC per day = 1800 BTC per day
365 days per year, so 1800*365 = 657,000 BTC per year
16 million BTC in existence, so the inflation per year is:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 100.0 * 657000 / 16000000
    4.10625

No. If they had 10% of all the mining power and now they have 7% of it, then their share has fallen by 30% of its old value, or 3% of the total.
It's a small pool which is attempting to use its power to block innovation. This post is about how people are leaving the pool because they don't support its attempts to block innovation. The pool itself claims that some of its hardware is moving to a new apartment or something. Possibly because it is, or possibly because they don't want to admit that their position is unpopular.

There is a checksum built in to the 12 words. Picking 12 words at random is unlikely to work for you. Even if all 12 words are picked from the list of 2048 words allowed in a BIP39 phrase you only have a 1 in 16 chance of satisfying the checksum requirement.
(Every word provides 11 bits of entropy; each triplet of words gives 32 bits towards the private key, and 1 bit of checksum. So a 12 word phrase has 128 bits of private key, and 4 bits of checksum)
You can play about with seed phrases at 
See you if you put "hotel verb excuse credit stamp ignore height outer shaft face puzzle tribe" into the BIP39 Mnemonic box it generates some addresses for you, but if you switch some words around it usually complains. Switch the last two words around and it says "Invalid mnemonic".

You would use normal (non-hardened) derivation if you wanted a third party to be able to derive the public keys which correspond to your private keys without having access to the private keys.
Suppose you have the xpub for account 3 in a hardware wallet: `m/44'/0'`. The receiving addresses are derived from `m/44'/0'/0` (a) and the change addresses are derived from `m/44'/0'/1` (b).
If you have the xpub for `m/44'/0'`, you can derive all the receiving and change addresses. This is because normal derivation is used in the last step of (a) and (b).
If, instead, change addresses were derived from `m/44'/0'/1'` (with the last step also being hardened) then having the xpub for `m/44'/0'` wouldn't let you derive any change addresses.
That's why normal derivation is used to go from the account level to the receiving/change level.
Bitcoin Core uses `m/0'/0'/0'` for its first address. The address itself is derived using hardened derivation. This means that the wallet itself can't generate new receiving addresses while it's locked. You can try it - set the keypool size to be something tiny, create a new wallet, encrypt it, then ask for new receiving addresses. You'll get as many as fit in the keypool, but then it will fail to generate any more addresses for you until you unlock the wallet.

Convert from base 52, then scale down to account for selecting cards without replacement:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; (52**1 * 23 + 52**0 * 4) * (52*51) / (52*52)
    1176
There are only 51 choices for the 2nd card.
Edit: it occurs to me that this is not a very good way of doing things. Try entering a full deck of 52 shuffled cards, for example:
    7S 9H 9S QH 8C KS AS 7D 7C QD 4S 4D TC 2D 5S JS 3D 8S 8H 4C 3C AC 3S QC 9C JC

Then rearrange the last 12 however you like:
    7S 9H 9S QH 8C KS AS 7D 7C QD 4S 4D TC 2D 5S JS 3D 8S 8H 4C 3C AC 3S QC 9C JC

    --&gt; script link worry obtain mind scene ugly announce bar cause lift park
        anger tomorrow thought disorder luxury lawsuit bring vessel impulse
You get the exact same output. The last 12 cards are effectively ignored by the scaling down. Even replace the last 12 with 12 identical cards:
    7S 9H 9S QH 8C KS AS 7D 7C QD 4S 4D TC 2D 5S JS 3D 8S 8H 4C 3C AC 3S QC 9C JC

I didn't read part 2 yet, but part 1 had a mistake I think:


The difficulty will be the same on both chains, so it will cost the same to find a block on either chain. If there is 3 times as much hashrate on one chain than the other then there will be 3 times as many blocks found, but the expected resources consumed per block will be the same on both chains.
The orphan rate will be lower on the Bitcoin chain (due to less competition) and the transaction fees per block will be higher (due to competition to get transactions into blocks) so the rational miner will mine on the Bitcoin chain not the BU chain.

Those are the most common units, sure.
But I don't think anyone is comparing things based on the price of the most common unit.
Do people think that the US dollar is weaker than the UK pound because one USD is worth only 0.8 GBP? I don't think so. They look at how the prices move relative to each other. In the last 2 years 1 USD has climbed from 0.6 GBP to 0.8 GBP and so the dollar is seen as strong relative to the pound even though it didn't reach parity.

The puzzle is something like:
Given the hash of the previous block and a big list of transactions you're confirming, find a number such that when you put that number into a block with the previous block hash and all the new transactions and then hash it, you get a hash which starts with enough zeroes, where "enough" is set by the current network difficulty.
And so the rule comes down to what I mean by "hash it". What I mean is run it through a double [SHA-256](

There are a couple of inconsistencies on that page.
First off they're unclear about the amount they will refund each day:




Is it 50 or 75 mBTC per day?
Secondly, they say it's "risk free"


but later they say they don't really refund losses, they credit it as "bonus money" which must be wagered 15 times:


That doesn't sound very "risk free".
Even if those two points were cleared up, there's still this catch-all:


They don't say what will be considered "abuse", but appear to be leaving themselves a way of just refusing to refund losses completely.

And that's what I'm objecting to. My 1% of the total hashrate gets me 1 or 2 blocks per day now, and will still get me 1 or 2 blocks per day after you somehow convince 75% of the miners to leave Bitcoin and mine BU instead.
What is this "*more* overall resource" that you think must be used? And why to produce a *smaller* number of coins? I will keep using *the same* amount of resource, as will the other 24% of the miners who stay on the main chain, and we will produce *the same* number of coins as before, too (around 36 blocks per day).

12.5 per block, plus whatever transaction fees were attached to the transactions that the miner included in the block.


How the reward is divided is up to the pool operator. Typically they will be divided in proportion to how much work each participant put into mining the block.


Pretty much. Though it's "mempool". And there's nothing to stop me sending a transaction to a particular miner and asking them to mine it "in secret". Once they solve a block the transaction will be public information, but until then nobody but the miner would know about it.


Nodes have a threshold that determines which transactions they will add to their mempool. If a transaction pays less fee per byte than I am willing to accept I will just ignore it and not add it to my mempool.


Very likely. It's up to the miners how their prioritize transactions, but since they get to keep the fees it is in their best interest to include whichever transactions pay the highest fee per byte.


Again, it's up to the miner. They can create blocks much smaller than 1MB if they want to, but would be sacrificing some amount of fees if they do so. This 1MB is the blocksize limit that people are debating about, yes.


There's a special rule: the first transaction in a block is allowed to have outputs which exceed the inputs by 12.5 BTC (plus fees). That is how the block reward is handed out. The miner creates the first transaction to typically have no inputs, and a single output for 12.5 BTC (plus fees) to an address of their own.


A private key is just a big number. You pick it at random and keep it secret.


They can be stolen, if someone discovers your private key. And they can be lost forever if you lose all copies of your private key.


Your wallet holds your private keys. Your private keys are used to sign transactions saying "I agree to send X coins to address Y". You broadcast the signed transaction, a miner puts it into a block, and from then on the coins you sent are no longer yours. You could try signing another transaction, saying "I agree to send X coins to address Z", but no miner would accept it, because they already saw that you sent the coins to address Y.


Let me know if there's something you don't understand. I'll try to help.

The logical negation of "A implies B" is "A and not B". To see this examine the truth table for both statements.
So: ~(price goes up means people use less of it) = (price goes up and people use no less of it)
While it's true that as things become more expensive the demand for the thing at that price decreases we have goals other than maximizing demand.
If all we cared about were demand we would run Bitcoin on a single large centralized server, stop all this cryptocurrency blockchain nonsense and offer free transactions for the next year as a loss leader.
But demand isn't all we care about. We care about the things that make Bitcoin unique, including its censorship resistance and security. To maintain those things we need to sacrifice some of the demand that would exist if transactions were free.


Isn't that the case for all goods? Price rises with demand and falls with supply. Economics 101. We would usually say the price rises in tandem with the demand rather than that the demand rises in tandem with the price but the point is they rise together.

The first thing I would do is check the transaction page in Mycelium. Do you see the transactions you expect to see?
If you do, and there's an extra transaction at the end taking your coins then presumably they were stolen.
But more likely is that you don't see the transactions you expect to see, and that you're looking at the wrong account. You can have as many accounts as you like from a single set of 12 words. Try adding a few more HD accounts and check the transaction page for each of them. One of them will probably show you the balance you expect to see.

The incentive is that running a full node allows you to tell when you have received money and when you haven't. It's like asking "as a store what's the monetary incentive for checking whether banknotes are counterfeit or not?" Why would you not want to know when someone was trying to defraud you?

My point is that you don't know what those programs are doing you only know what their authors claim they are doing. You need to trust that they encrypt the private key client side and don't ever send it to their authors. It would be possible for any wallet to "go rogue" in its next release and you'd likely not notice until it stole your coins. All three are distributed in binary form. Even if you make a point of downloading the source code (where available) before installing each new update you have no guarantee that the binary you download from the app store corresponds to the source code you have audited. In short, you are trusting the wallet not to rob you.

They paid you using 5 'bills' (inputs), worth a total of 0.0099 but they only owed you 0.0078 so they got 0.0014 back as 'change' (and paid 0.0007 in fees to the miner).

The transaction ID depends on *everything* in the transaction, which includes which coins it is spending, and which addresses it is sending them to, and the amount that goes to each address.
There's no way to "reverse' the txid to get back to the information in the transaction, but most transactions are public and so you can look up the txid and find the details.

Each time someone sends you some BTC, that is a new "output" in your wallet. When you spend your BTC you use those unspent outputs as "inputs" for a new transaction.
If you receive 1 BTC three times, you will have three 1 BTC outputs in your wallet. They don't merge into a singe 3 BTC output.
Then, when you send 1.5 BTC to someone, your wallet will pick two of your 1 BTC outputs and use them as inputs to a new transaction. Your transaction will have two outputs: one sending 1.5 to whoever you're paying, and the other sending 0.5 back to yourself.
After that you will have two outputs in your wallet: the remaining unspent 1 BTC output, and the new 0.5 output.
Does that help?

Short answer: the "hard problem" is to keep running sha256(sha256(block_header)) until the result is less than the current target. You get to change the block header in various ways, but the work is in running the sha256() operations enough times until you get lucky and find an input that results in a low (double) hash.

They claim that BCH is "the real Bitcoin", and so taking you to "buy BCH" when you want to "buy Bitcoin" is the right thing to do.
They are wrong, but at least their argument is kind of internally consistent. Once you have been tricked into believing that BCH is the real thing, the rest follows naturally.
"The real Bitcoin" adjusts its difficulty every 2016 blocks (ie. about once every 2 weeks). BCH adjusts its difficulty every block. That alone tells you which one is the "real" Bitcoin.
The BCH guys will tell you that "Bitcoin BTC" was taken over by the new world order or some such who limited the blocksize to 1 MB. But it turns out it was satoshi who limited the blocksize to 1 MB, and SegWit allows blocks to be bigger than that thanks to a soft fork, and now blocks are regularly larger than a million bytes if you include the witness data.

I'm not very familiar with Electrum, but I expect it changes each time you receive coins at the previous address. It is trying to have you avoid using the same address multiple times. Reusing address compromises your privacy and the privacy of those you trade with.
Having said that, you should be able to keep using the same address. Just make a note of the receiving address and keep using that one if you want to. Electrum will recognize coins sent to any of its receiving addresses.

Note also that the nonce is only 32 bits wide. That only gives you 4 billion possible guesses which modern mining hardware can tear through very quickly. So miners also modify bits in their block reward transaction to give them more space that they can mess with to change the hash.
As a result, the value of the nonce doesn't really tell you anything, because it's only a number between 0 and about 4 billion, whereas the number of hashes tried will likely be much bigger than 4 billion.
And finally, re. "each zero represents a double or half of difficulty", it depends how you're writing the target. Usually you'll see it written in hexadecimal (base 16), in which case each extra leading zero represents 16 times more difficulty. If it was written in binary (base 2) then you'd be right that each zero represents a doubling of difficulty.

Addresses can be used to receive funds, but not to spend them. It is safe to give a receiving address to anyone you want to. The only problem is that if you tell me the receiving address you're going to give to the guy you're working for, I will be able to see how much he sends you.
Each address has a corresponding private key which is used to spend the funds at that address. You can probably ask your wallet to tell you the private key for a receiving address, but you usually won't need to. You shouldn't ever tell anyone your private keys unless you want them to be able to spend the coins that are in your wallet.

No, how "child pays for parent" works is as follows:
If someone has sent you a payment with a low transaction fee, and it isn't confirming fast enough for you, you can't do anything about the fee on that transaction since you're just the recipient of the transaction. What you can do however is spend the unconfirmed output back to yourself with a big fee. That will get the miners' attention. They want to claim the new big fee, but in order to confirm your new transaction they first have to confirm its parent (the low-fee payment to you).
CPFP incentivizes the miners to confirm the original low-fee transaction in preference to other higher paying transactions by other people. It isn't a double-spend; it's spending the output of the unconfirmed tx, not any of the inputs.

You could send a fixed amount per block split between the output addresses of the coinbase transaction. Most blocks have a single output in the coinbase transaction, so it wouldn't be too costly in transaction fees.
However I don't know if it's fair to try to influence miners with what is effectively bribery.
Also, even if you don't care about that, it would be quite expensive if you want your donations to be significant to the miners: if we assume 20% of blocks are signalling for segwit, that's 360 BTC per day those miners are earning. Even if you donate 3.6 BTC per day to those miners, that's only 1% extra for them.

Alternatively look at  and see if there are any Bitcoin buyers near you. I can't promise that they'll charge less than 3% though. Otherwise you're stuck dealing with Bitcoin Exchanges.

"Safe" is relative. You scanned the private key into a web browser while your computer was online. It's not inconceivable that your machine was infected with a virus at the time which grabbed a copy of the private key. But if that happened, I would expect the coins to have already been stolen.
It's possible that the owner of the virus is waiting for you to put more coins into that address before stealing them, but I would say that's quite unlikely.
All in all I would say you're pretty safe, but not 100% safe. I guess you need to decide whether "99% safe" is good enough for you. Is it worth the time and effort to make a new paper wallet and move the coins over.
Some people will tell you that you shouldn't reuse addresses at all, for various reasons. It's true that the public key of the paper wallet address is now published to the blockchain, and so the paper wallet is slightly less secure as a result. (Until you spend from an address its public key is secret; only the hash of the public key is public; knowing the public key opens you up to theoretical attacks from quantum computers, whereas not knowing the public key gives you an extra layer of protection).
tl;dr: You're probably safe, but if you want to be sure you should move the coins to a new paper wallet.

Bitcoin Core uses a different derivation path than any other wallet I know of. In particular it uses hardened derivation at the address level and so it cannot generate addresses from an xpub; it needs the xprv even to generate public keys.
So even if you do import your old BIP32 extended private and public keys you most likely won't see the addresses you were expecting to see.
The 27th address generated by Core has a `hdkeypath` of `m/0'/0'/26'` for example. Note the `'` after all 3 levels indicating hardened derivation.

At first sight it appears that the BIP39 passphrase offers similar security to encrypting a BIP38 paper wallet, but it doesn't, because of the relative complexity of brute-forcing the passphrases.
For BIP38 paper wallets a [6 character random passphrase]( is pretty secure. It takes so long to test each passphrase. On the other hand a 6 character BIP39 passphrase can be brute-forced relatively quickly.
[BIP38]( uses 16384 rounds of scrypt to protect against brute force attacks.
[BIP39]( uses just 2048 rounds of HMAC-SHA512, which is much faster and offers very little protection.

You can use as many as you want. There are only 160 different P2PKH Bitcoin addresses and so 160 coin flips would be enough.
If you're only going to flip 160 coins then you'll only need a 15 word seed phrase to capture your coin tosses too. (Each 3 words gives you 32 bits of entropy plus one bit of checksum).

I don't think SegWit activation kills ASICBOOST, or even covert ASICBOOST. Miners are free to continue mining pre-SegWit blocks if they want to, without a witness commitment in the coinbase. They won't be able to include any SegWit transactions, but to start with that won't cost them much in missed fees.
Even if they do want to include witness transactions in their block they can still use overt ASICBOOST, but I don't think that's such an energy saver.

The question doesn't really mean anything, as you note in your first sentence.
The price of Bitcoin already surpassed the price of a gram of gold ($39) but didn't yet surpass the price of a kilogram of gold ($39000).
The units for both gold and Bitcoin are arbitrary. We happen to call 100 million satoshis "1 BTC", but that was an arbitrary decision. Satoshi could have decided that 1 million satoshis was a Bitcoin, or 1 billion.
Bitcoin looks like a solid investment if the price isn't too volatile, and tends to go up more than it goes down (relative to what? USD? Gold? Something else?)

The one thing you really need is the list of all unspent outputs.
To get that, you start at block 0 and work through them one at a time. You go through every transaction in every block.
When a transaction spends some coins, you check that those coins exist in your list of unspent outputs, then delete those coins from your list.
When a transaction creates some coins, you add those coins to your list of unspent outputs.
Once you've done that for every transaction in a block you can throw away that block. But you need to have worked through the block to keep your list of unspent outputs up to date.
See what I mean?
You could just ask me for my list of unspent outputs, and save yourself all that downloading and work. But I might give you a bad list with some fake coins on it. Then a week later I could try to sell you some fake coins. Your node would see them in its list and you'd accept my fake coins, thinking they were real. So you really ought to create your own list of unspent outputs by working through the full 250 GB blockchain.

Right. The dice is always 2^256 sided.
I don't remember what the initial target was, but your math seems off. 2^256 is 2^32 times 2^224, so about 4 billion times bigger, not 1 billion.
Other than that you're right about how the dice analogy would apply. It took over a year (I think) for the global bitcoin hashrate to get high enough for the difficulty get harder. That means globally we weren't able to do the required 4 billion hashes in 600 seconds on average for the first year.
4 billion divided by 600 gives about 7 million. So that means that for the first year bitcoin didn't have miners doing 7 million hashes per second in total.  So I doubt ordinary computers could do a million hashes per second, because according to Craig Wright's totally credible testimony he alone was mining on more than 7 computers at the time.
Edit: I see [this wiki page]( came to the same 7 megahash result. But that may have been written by me. I forget.

It will also show you the individual private keys for each of an infinite number of addresses generated from that seed phrase, which you can import one at a time.

I wouldn't say that the space of private keys is comparable to the space of Bitcoin addresses. It is 2^96 times bigger. ie. for each Bitcoin address there are around 2^96 collisions. I don't understand how you can say "even if collision exists", as if there's some way 2^256 things can fit into 2^160 spaces without any overlap.

I would recommend using a new paper wallet each time you spend any of one of them. So you have coins in paper wallet A, and want to spend some of them. Spend some, and send the change to new paper wallet B. And so on. When you want to spend from B, send the change to new paper wallet C.
One way of managing this without needing to keep printing new wallets is to use something like BIP44 which allows you to generate an infinite number of private keys from a single seed. This is what the hardware wallets do, but you can do the same thing using a dedicated offline computer - like an old laptop with networking disabled.
Take a look at  for instance to see how that works.

Note that "full node" means "fully validating node". It doesn't mean you have to keep a full copy of the blockchain. You can prune the blocks, only keeping the most recent 550 MB of blockchain data and still call yourself a "full node", because you will still be fully validating all incoming blocks and transactions.
If you also choose to keep the full blockchain, you're what's known as an [archival node](
If you enable pruning, your disk space requirements drop substantially. You can prune all but 550 MB of block data, so all you need to store is that 550 MB of block data, and the current UTXO set which is currently 3.5 GB, for a total of 4 GB of data.
Here's a summary of the disk usage (in MB) of my pruned full node:
    $ du -m
    3495	./chainstate
    76	./blocks/index
    580	./blocks
    4074	.
So 5 GB of disk space is enough.
As for the initial ~200 GB download, you do need to do that unless you are willing to trust someone else to give you a copy of their UTXO set. I could make a zip file of my 4 GB .bitcoin folder and share it with you, and you could run a full node using that as its starting point. But you would have to trust that I didn't mess with it at all. I could have added in a few made up unspent outputs which I later use to trick you into accepting a fake payment. To counteract that, there's a command `gettxoutsetinfo` in Bitcoin Core which shows you a hash of the full UTXO set at the current block height. You could run that and check that your node's hash matches that of a node you trust at the same height.

This doesn't matter. Any private key which has a public key which hashes to give your address can be used to spend your funds. It doesn't matter whether it's the same as your "real" private key or not. There are roughly 2^(256-160) = 2^96 different private keys that unlock each (p2phk) address.

    if (CastToBool(stack.back()) == false)

It's amazing how many incorrect replies you received.
Addresses starting with a 3 are P2SH addresses. That stands for "Pay To Script Hash".
One guy told you that 3 addresses are "wrapped segwit". That's partially true, and closest to a correct answer you received, but not all 3 addresses are wrapped segwit. Only some of them are.
Another guy told you that 3 addresses are "multisig". That's partially true, but not all 3 addresses are multisig.
Another guy PMed you with a tool that would help you understand how public key derivation works, but you publicly called him out as a scammer. If you don't trust the site, put in a made up seed. Either way it will help you understand. The URL I use is  which looks different than the one he sent you, so maybe he was trying to scam you. I don't know.
Finally some guy got mad because he thought you were copying the seed from your Trezor into an online wallet while you clearly stated that you were copying from the online wall to the Trezor.
The bottom line is that "3" addresses are derived from the hash of a script. The script can be pretty much anything, and so you can't tell from looking at a 3 address what kind of address it is, other than that its script was hashed. In order to spend from a "3" address you have to publish the script, and so at that point the script becomes public.

Most addresses have 33 characters after the initial '1'. That's 30 different places the SLAG can start.
There are 58 characters used in addresses. The chance of a SLAG in any single position is `1 in 58*58*58*58`, and the chance of a SLAG in any of the 30 positions is about 30 times greater, or `1 in 58*58*58*58/30`, or `1 in 377k`.
Edit: There are 5454 4 letter words in the (US) scrabble dictionary. 2848 of them have no I or O in them (letters forbidden in Bitcoin addresses). So the odds of finding any 4 letter word in all-caps in a Bitcoin address is 2848 times greater than that of finding a SLAG, or `1 in 132`.

Yes. Except each miner is working on their own version of the next block. Each one probably has a slightly different set of transactions they're trying to include. The miner who solves his block first publishes it, all the other miners check his work, see that he "won" so they delete all the transactions he confirmed from their own copy of the mempool and move on to working on the next block with whatever transactions they have left in their mempool.


There are always more than 1 MB worth of unconfirmed transactions out there. Some people constantly generate spam transactions paying very little fee. So in that sense there is never "enough space in the block" for every transaction to make it in. I wouldn't worry too much about my example of a miner being the only one to know about a transaction that I sent him in private. It's not a common case, or particularly useful.


You seem confused here. A "confirmed transaction" literally *is* a transaction that is in a solved block. So there can't be any confirmed transactions that don't fit into a block. By definition of "confirmed transaction". It takes 10 minutes on average for a block to be mined. During that 10 minutes each miner is trying to solve a block by [hashing]( a bunch of transactions together with a nonce and hoping to get a low-enough hash out of it. They'll likely be working on the best 1 MB of transactions they know about. Also during the 10 minutes they will be constantly checking the mempool. If a new unconfirmed transaction shows up with a particularly juicy fee attached, they will throw the lowest-fee transaction out, and include the new big-fee transaction instead to maximize the fees they collection if they end up solving the block.


They are the same job. You confirm transactions by solving a block with them in, and you solve the block by finding just the right contents of the block to make its hash be lower than the current network target.


A full node is any Bitcoin client with a full copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. All 100 GB of it, or whatever it is now. Full nodes aren't necessarily mining. I run a few full nodes, but I do not mine. I run them to help support the network, and so that I can verify transactions which people pay me with, without having to trust someone else's full node to do the verification for me.
If you don't want to run a full node, you can run a "pruned" node. Pruned nodes only keep the most recent so many blocks, along with a complete list of all the coins which haven't been spent yet. For example, if back in 2010 person A sent some coins to person B, and person B sent them on to person C then there's no need for a pruned node to remember anything about that except for that person C has some coins. A and B are no longer relevant in terms of verifying future transactions that might occur (when person C attempts to spend his coins we had better know that he owns them, but we don't need to remember where he got them from, so long as we know that in the past we did check that they really are his). A pruned node can't help others get new nodes up and running, because it has forgotten all the ancient history (like when A gave coins to B) - and that ancient history is necessary for the new node to be sure that C owns coins today. I hope that makes sense.


The difficulty is just a number - a target the miners aim for.
Mining is basically taking the transactions you're trying to confirm, and hashing them over and over (with minor changes) until you get a hash that is lower than the current difficulty target. Since hashes are effectively random, it takes a long time to find a low hash. If blocks are being found too fast, the difficulty target is lowered. And if they're being found too slow it's made higher. This happens every 2 weeks (actually every 2016 blocks).

 can generate you a list of 12 or 24 seed words and will run entirely offline.
I recently talked him into adding a "supply your own entropy" option, so you can roll dice or flip coins in the real world and type them into his tool - that way you don't have to trust the random number generator code to be truly random.
Visit the site, go offline, generate your 12 words, verify that you can load them in Mycelium and get the same receiving address. Then repeat, but this time don't load them into Mycelium, just keep them offline.
For best results never go online again with the computer you used. That may not be an option, but depending on the amount of value you're trying to secure it may be a worthwhile precaution. Maybe you have an old laptop you can retire.
Edit: also, Electrum is incompatible with every other wallet I know of. Mycelium uses BIP44, as do most other HD wallets, including the hardware wallets. So it's Electrum that's incompatible with "rest of the world", not Mycelium.

"full" = "validates every transaction in every block"
"archival" = "has all the blocks"
"pruned" = "only has the most recent N megabytes of block data, along with the full UTXO set"
You prefer to think that "full" and "archival" are the same thing, right?


I'd say to call them "archival nodes". Because then the majority of people would know what you meant. If you call them "full nodes" people might think you were talking about fully validating nodes (since that's the generally accepted definition), which includes pruned nodes.


I'm with you, only replace "full" with "archival".
The big problem with Ethereum is it has hardly any full nodes, let alone archival nodes. People can't keep up with validating the new blocks even if they don't store them indefinitely.

The "wallet.dat" file format is from Bitcoin Core. You can get the latest release here: 
To find out for sure what is in the wallet you need to download the whole blockchain which is over 200 GB and will take up to a week to download. But as soon as you run Bitcoin Core with an old wallet.dat file it should show you what was in the wallet the last time you used it, so that's a good way of figuring out which of your wallet.dat files is the right one.

There's no point to it, other than that it takes a lot of work, and so costs a lot of money to do. This prevents trolls from creating fake invalid blocks and wasting everyone's time. Before anyone's node will even bother downloading a block you say you've mined you have to provide a valid block header, which hashes to a very low value. Most people don't have the resources or motivation to do so.

It sounds to me like you may have used bitbargain to buy the coins and then sent the coins to your own local wallets.

It sounds like you don't really understand the basic concept. It's like this:
If I ask you roll a 20 sided dice until you roll 4 or less, it will take you on average 5 tries before you manage it.
If I want to make it more difficult, I could ask you to keep going until you roll 2 or less. Then it will take you on average 10 tries.
That's all the mining difficulty is doing. Miners have to keep trying different nonces until the hash is less than the current target. The lower the target, the harder it is.
Also, you mentioned "depending on how many nodes there are" which isn't right. Nobody knows how many nodes there are, and it doesn't matter. The target is adjusted based on nothing other than how long the previous 2016 blocks took to mine. If it took too long, the target is increased (making it easier), and if it didn't take long enough, the target is decreased (making it harder). Of course, this indirectly depends on the amount of hashpower that is mining - but it's not possible to know for sure how much hashpower is mining. We can only guess it based on how often blocks are found.

I spent a while today trying to understand what Core does, and why it is giving such high estimates when targeting the next block.
It watches for unconfirmed transactions on the network and checks how many blocks each one takes to confirm. It sums them in 98 different 'buckets' (numbered 0 through 97) based on how much fee per kB they pay. Bucket 0, for transactions paying from 0 to 0.00001000 BTC per kB, bucket 1 for transactions paying 0.00001000 to 0.00001100 BTC per kB, etc., up to bucket 97 for transactions paying over 0.094123 BTC per kB. Each bucket's upper range is 10% higher than that of the previous bucket.
When asked to estimate the fee to get confirmed within B blocks, it starts at the highest fee bucket and works backwards, looking for a range of contiguous buckets which when combined:
1. have at least 1 transaction per block on average fitting into the bucket range, and
2. have at least 95% of the transactions in the bucket range confirming within B blocks
It keeps searching until a range it finds satisfies 1. (enough volume) but not 2. (too little chance of fast enough confirmation). The range before that one is the cheapest range with enough volume to be statistically significant and with a 95% chance of getting confirmed fast enough. It then finds the median bucket in the range, by transaction count, and calculates the average fee per kB for that bucket. That average is the estimate it provides.
That's quite a long explanation, but it turns out that at the moment the first range it finds which meets the average 1 tx per block requirement is buckets 74 through 97, paying 0.01051153 or more, and even that high fee range only has a 95.15% chance of getting into the next block.
The next range that satisfies the first requirement is buckets 64 through 73, paying 0.00405265 to 0.01051153 per kB, but transactions in that range only have a 93.57% chance of getting into the next block, so that range is rejected and the first range is used, resulting in the ~0.01 BTC per kB estimate we see.
Part of the problem is that a significant number of blocks are empty or almost empty and so no matter how much fee you pay it's hard to get more than a 96% chance of getting into the next block. Perhaps it would be better to lower the threshold to 90% or something.
In `src/policy/fees.h` we see this:
    /** Require greater than 95% of X feerate transactions to be confirmed within Y blocks for X to be big enough */
    static const double MIN_SUCCESS_PCT = .95;
Change the `.95` to `.90` and rebuild if you're happy to only have a 90% chance of getting into the block you want.

* [informative long comment in the source code](
* [Alex Morcos' mailing list post about how the code works]( - wish I had seen this before writing my post! Note that he writes this - the 80% later became 85% and then 95%:

I can imagine running a node which only downloads and verifies the signatures for  transactions which directly pay me, and their ancestors. So long as I can verify the signatures on a chain of transactions from the initial block rewards to the transaction which pays me I can be confident that the payment is "real". Can't I?
Maybe not, because it's possible that &gt;51% of the hashrate isn't doing segwit signature verification at all, and so a block with an invalid signature got into the chain which the majority silently accepted. My node would trust that majority to have verified the signatures and will end up believing that it had been paid when in fact it hadn't.

That web page is apparently out of date. The point it is making about Electrum lacking deterministic builds is no longer true.
But in case you still wonder what that means, they are saying that for Bitcoin Core, there is a way that you can build it such that if two people take the same version of the Core source code they are guaranteed to end up with identical binary files. When a new version of Core is released, a bunch of independent developers all build it, and all check that the binary they produce is the same for all of them. They sign statements promising that that was the case. This means it's very unlikely that the binary you end up with was compiled from a hacked version of the source code.
In contract, Electrum didn't used to have a way of doing deterministic builds. That would mean that each time anyone built an electrum binary they would get a slightly different binary file, and so you would have no way of knowing whether the binary you downloaded was built from the official sources of from a set of modified sources which occasionally steal all your coins.
But as I say, apparently both Electrum and Core now offer deterministic builds, so this is no longer a concern.

There are two ways you end up using addresses, and so two ways you could end up reusing the same address twice.
Almost every time you send coins from your wallet there is some "change" output which is sent back to your wallet. Bitcoin Core will use a new address for each change output, so you don't have to worry about address reuse there. You can use the coin control feature to specify the change address manually, and by doing so you could have it reuse the same address for change, but that won't happen unless you go out of your way to make it happen.
The other way of using an address is when someone sends you some coins. Each time you go to the receiving tab of Bitcoin Core and ask it for an address, it will give you a different address. So you just need to make sure you do this each time you ask someone to send you money. There's nothing to stop me from sending two different transactions to an address you give me, but you could ask me not to.
Personally I always give people a new unused address when asking for coins. On a couple of occasions they have found that they didn't have enough coins in one place, so sent me payments from two different exchanges (or whatever) to the same address. There's really not much I can do about that.
tl;dr: Bitcoin Core doesn't reuse change addresses unless you ask it to, and won't reuse receiving addresses either unless you want it to.

Yes, you will receive your 12.5 BTC reward IF you also download some mining software (Bitcoin Core doesn't contain mining software), and IF your crazy luck happens before the reward halves to 6.25 BTC in less than a year, and IF no other miner finds a block at around the same time as you do, and the network arbitrarily chooses to build on top of their block instead of yours, orphaning your block.
In other words yes, but you didn't have enough IFs in your question...
Not only does the blockchain not care what device you used, it also cannot tell what device you used. The relaying is done peer to peer anyway - you tell a couple of peers about your block. They validate it, and pass it on to their peers, and this continues until everyone knows about it. Other than the peers you told directly, the others don't even know which peer found the block let alone what hardware they used.

If you wanted to use a 2-of-3 address to leave your fortune to your goldfish, and were happy to always use the same address, then you wouldn't need to tell anyone the public keys so long as you had at any time before your death made a transaction which spends from that address.
That is because every time you spend from a P2SH address your transaction includes a full copy of the script which corresponds to the address, which in the case of multisig includes all 3 public keys.
So your two friends could simply look up the 3 public keys in the Bitcoin blockchain after your death. All they need to know is the address, and their private key.
Here's an example from the blockchain. Apparently it's Bitfinex's cold wallet, which is a 3-of-6 multisig. See  and scroll down a bit. You'll see this:

Those are the signatures for the 3 keys that signed, and the P2SH script itself again, in hex format.
So, to spend from the Bitfinex cold wallet I don't need anyone to tell me the 6 public keys. I know them already - they're public. All I need is 3 of the 6 private keys.

I am limited to 100 GB per month total (up plus down).
I only download blocks, not unconfirmed transactions:
    blocksonly=1
and I only connect to a single peer (one that I run in a data center with good connectivity):
    connect=a.b.c.d
So I have no upload, and only download each confirmed transaction once. It allows me to trustlessly and privately receive BTC payments, and uses just 5 GB per month.
My node has only been up 4.6 days since I last restarted it:
It has downloaded 755 MB from its peer (and shared it with another node on the LAN):
755 MB in 4.6 days works out at around 5000 MB per month, pretty accurately matching my previous calculation.

I don't deny that. Your claims are still false however.
"It has seen the most wagered volume of all other crowdfunded gambling sites" - no. Just-Dice saw more. "the most profitable crowdfunded site" - no. Just-Dice was more profitable.


True. But as I said the bankroll never dropped below 11k, and the price of Bitcoin went way higher than the current price during that year. At its peak Just-Dice's bankroll was over $60 million dollars worth of BTC. That's likely more than 5 times higher than PRC ever reached.


True. I came up with the concept and it took a while for people to come up with their own crappy clones.


That never happened. I made it clear that I didn't vouch for either site, and couldn't since I had no idea who was behind either of them.


I heard that come the end you were charging 50% commission. That seems a little greedy to me. And now you're changing to some kind of ICO thing where you keep 70% of the profits and there's no "divest" option... I can't wait to see how you implement the final 100% commission option. :)


That's just like your opinion, man.

I [heard recently]( that Bitcoin Core "just works" with the Coldcard, but I also heard that it requires some messing about with the command line so I'm not sure. I expect things will get better in that regard as the hardware wallet interface stuff for Core becomes part of the release.
@_date: 2019-06-07 22:56:27
I'd recommend updating to the current released version and running that with the old wallet.dat file. It may "just work". If not, run it without networking enabled so it can't download any more blocks and dump the funded private keys.
In the console you can "listunspent" to find out which addresses have UTXOs on them, and "dumpprivkey" to get the private key for each address in turn.

There are two ways of losing your Bitcoins:
1) someone else gets access to them and steals them
2) you lose access to them and can never spend them
ie. either 2 people get access, or 0 people get access.
You want to keep the number of people with access at exactly 1: you.
Using a web wallet risks having more than one person have access to your coins - the owner of the web wallet could potentially steal them. At blockchain.info they use some client-side javascript that means they don't need to know your keys on the server side, but that javascript could change at any time and start stealing people's coins.
Using a local wallet risks having less than one person have access to your coins - when your hard drive crashes and you lose the only copy. The solution is to make backups. Use an HD wallet, and make a note of the 12 word seed somewhere safe.
Of course, you then have to make sure than exactly 1 person has access to the 12 word seed, which is a similar problem to the previous one, but hopefully it's easier with something on paper than it is with electronic data.

Ha, no. Nobody accepted Bitcoin payments back then. The guy who wanted pizza sent the 10k BTC to someone who wanted the Bitcoins, who in exchange ordered him two large pizzas - presumably using his credit card, paying dollars, as usual. So the pizza place ended up with $20 or whatever the pizzas cost.
This was the first time Bitcoin was ever traded for some kind of product, and really was a milestone that took Bitcoin's price from zero to non-zero.
I don't know what happened to the 10k BTC after that, whether the new owner of them held onto them for long or not. Maybe he waited a few months and exchanged them for four large pizzas. :)

Bitcoin already solved the problem - in fact the problem has never existed with Bitcoin.
It isn't possible to reject a Bitcoin transaction. The $100k worth of BTC was sent from the donator to BitPay.
BitPay have somehow created this problem. They have decided not to pass the $100k on to their client for whatever reason. That's not Bitcoin's fault.

View the transaction that spends from the address you're interested on blockstream's explorer:
The public key is the 2nd value in the witness, ie. `026bf7e721218530b224f56d8febfe967e5d9b2a41bfe261cf62b782485aaf3d28`.
If you are running a full node that knows about the transaction you could find the public key like this:
    $ bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 026d5ea536d43c79820483739886db88641a8e43c521fea6cdf23d815de7cb7b 1 | jq -r '.vin[0].txinwitness[1]'

It also increases risk. If I buy monthly instead of buying right now I risk missing out on sub $10k Bitcoins. I risk paying a lot more per coin next month, and eve more the month after that. Historically the price of BTC has trended up, so delaying purchases has for the most part been riskier than purchasing ASAP.

When you spend from a multisig address you have to provide signatures for the keys you use, and all the public keys. So if it's a 2-of-3 you have to provide 2 signatures and 3 public keys.
This means, of course, that if there have ever been any spends from the address before then you can look up all the public keys on the blockchain, so long as you know the address that holds the coins.
But OP is probably using HD wallets with seeds and doesn't reuse addresses, so that's not going to work.

Just-Dice's crowdfunded bankroll was over 11,000 BTC within the first week of operation and never dropped below that level until suspending operations for BTC a year later.
To make claims like:

is just wrong.


Just-Dice saw over a million BTC wagered in a single day. That's more than double the volume that your site has seen in its entire lifetime. 7200 BTC profit in 2 years? Just-Dice made over 19,000 BTC profit in just 1 year. You also fail to mention that your site was running very much better than expected, and that the 7200 BTC profit was a result of good luck. A 1% house edge would be expected to return you a 3,970 BTC profit on 397k BTC wagered.

Some P2SH addresses have never been spent from. For those all you can say is that they are P2SH addresses.

Trading BTC for USD on an exchange is two transactions: one BTC transaction and one USD transaction. Both are "off chain" in that they both happen in the exchange's database only, and not on the blockchain (for the BTC transaction) or the bank accounts (for the USD transaction).
Most exchange users will make multiple off-chain transactions (multiple trades) before putting the result on the chain (by withdrawing).
If you look at the Chinese exchanges, where there are no fees for trading, and only fees for withdrawing, there will be hundreds if not thousands of trades per withdrawal. I wouldn't be surprised if the number of such off-chain transactions outnumber the on chain transactions by a factor of 100 or more.
Edit: also, what about off-chain betting sites, like primedice.com? They have processed billions of bets. Each of those bets results in Bitcoins changing hands in an off-chain manner. Players deposit, have a balance in the site's database, and watch their balance go up and down as they play, until they finally make a withdrawal. That can be 2 on-chain transactions for millions of (off-chain) bets.

I prefer the last of the 3 charts on  - it shows recent history of how deep the waiting list has been at each fee rate.
Edit: here's a screenshot. At 79 sat/B you're towards the top of the dirty yellow 70-80 band, and are very nearly at the top of the mempool now. With luck your tx is already confirmed now.
Edit: block 581316 ate up the majority of that 70-80 band, so your transaction almost certainly made it into that block if it didn't get into 581315.

That's normal. You'll need to make the bitcoin.conf file. A single line saying `prune=1000` is all you need.
Your main problem does indeed sound like a problem. If the wallet doesn't have the private key for the address that holds your funds then it doesn't matter how much of the chain you sync, the wallet isn't going to be able to spend the coins without access to the private key.
You mentioned "the new folder", so maybe you have an old folder too, with a different wallet.dat in it? If so, maybe that is the one which has your private key. Be careful when switching from one wallet to another. Don't move any files around while Bitcoin Core is still running or you can end up with corrupted files or inconsistent states.
I would try running Core on the old folder and seeing if `dumpprivkey` has any more luck there.

About 2 hours ago the mempool was almost completely cleared out. Any transaction paying 1 sat/vB or more was confirmed.

Having a Bitcoin be worth 5 million dollars sounds like a lot, but that's because you have some idea of what a dollar is worth and what it can purchase.
There's no reason the US dollar should continue to be worth as much as it currently is in the future. Fiat currencies don't tend to have a very long lifespan before they lose their value. It's conceivable that one day 5 million dollars won't be enough to cover your weekly grocery bill. Then are you happy if your 1 BTC is worth 5 million dollars? It doesn't mean Bitcoin has succeeded, it just means that the dollar has failed.

Most Bitcoins pass through exchanges at some point. Most of those end up being merged together into huge cold wallet UTXOs. If any of the inputs to those huge UTXOs has ever been stolen, then the entire huge UTXO is tainted with stolen coins. This happens a lot, and tainting is a one-way street. There's no "untainting". Not a proof, but an explanation of at least why it's feasible that what I say is correct. Obviously there are big chunks of BTC that have never moved. Satoshi's million or so BTC aren't tainted with stolen coins for example.

It sounds like you're implementing a wallet. If so you only typically add new addresses before they have been used, so there's never a need to scan from the start of time. Just add the new address to the list you're searching for, and search each new block as it arrives.
If on the other hand you're implementing something like a block explorer, which is meant to give you quick access to a list of all the transactions any random address was involved in, you're going to want to maintain an index, because scanning the ~200 GB blockchain for each address is kind of slow.

Sorry, I missed your final question. You're right. "Request payment" isn't going to give you an address it doesn't think you've used before. Unless you're currently using an old backup of the wallet from before you generated the address which holds your coins, "request payment" won't give you a funded address.

Suppose yesterday Bitcoin was $10k, and so Tether was 1/10000 BTC.
Suppose today Bitcoin rose 10% to $11k, and so Tether was 1/11000 BTC.
Bitcoin rose $1k from $10k to $11k. That's a rise of 10%.
Tether fell 0.0000090909 BTC from 0.0001000000 BTC to 0.0000909091 BTC. That's a fall of 9.090909%.

You can convert from xprv to zprv - they're the same thing, but with a different 4 bytes on the start.
Here's how I do it using 4 lines of Python. I think "base58" is a library I installed using "pip3".
    $ python3
    Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr  3 2019, 05:39:12) 
    [GCC 8.3.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import base58
    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 'xprv9s21ZrQH143K2f55zo5GiXiX16MiPzBgc2bEXNd77e1ooGsjxAyXjozyuniqiSB76VESjTW8s7vdsK3NFboha6tZgF9BzcDdNtUT6Aw99P2'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; zp = b'\x04\xb2\x43\x0c'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; base58.b58encode_check(zp + base58.b58decode_check(x)[4:]).decode('ascii')
    'zprvAWgYBBk7JR8GjFTKfWeX8huXM2ecHEAgSFdg6AQssemZuUWCTVJeywKFxCe1iFUwumU4EQhFnSdjdtGVgzdjAaFmQvY3ARrbvLbjsLf6oNE'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 
I don't know if that's something you'll be able to follow along with or not.
Edit: that value for zp looks weird, but it's just the 4 bytes that are always used to make a zprv key. You can see the same 4 bytes [here]( in the Electrum source code.
For converting to xprv or yprv you can use xp or yp instead of zp:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; xp = b'\x04\x88\xad\xe4'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; yp = b'\x04\x9d\x78\x78'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; zp = b'\x04\xb2\x43\x0c'
Edit3: sounds like you don't need a zprv. Those are for creating bc1 addresses. If you want to be seeing legacy '1' addresses then an xprv is fine. But BIP84 is for bc1 addresses, which is why I'm confused.

They'll be sending some kind of a voucher code. The recipient can use it to deposit the same amount in the same exchange, so the BTC won't actually move. It will just be a database entry in the exchange's system.
You're already trusting the exchange to hold your coins so this doesn't seem to add much extra disk. I guess you are introducing the risk that the email will be sent in plain text and could be read by a third party.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:50:15


You can always send to old addresses from new software. It's the other way around that is the problem. Some companies don't bother updating their code to support SegWit, even though SegWit has been active for a long time now. If you choose to keep dealing with those companies you will need to provide them with a legacy address when accepting coins from them.

[Right here](
The block subsidy halves every 210k blocks, which is about every 4 years. Starting in 2008 at 5 billion satoshis per block, each 10 halvings divide the reward by about 1000, so 30 halvings divide it by a billion to 5 satoshis, and 2 more drop it to a single satoshi. 32 halvings take about 128 years. 128 years after 2008 is 2136. 4 years later the reward drops to zero, in 2140.

It was always designed for the reward to drop to 0 after 33 halvings, but the original implementation was buggy due to how compilers implement bit-shifting by more than 63 bits on a 64 bit register. Due to the bug, the reward after 64 halvings would have been the same as after 0 halvings, ie. 50 BTC.


It will be exactly 1 satoshi after the 32nd halving, and exactly 0 after the 33rd.

I made a raw transaction that spends the same output 77 times, signed it, then replaced the txid:vout in the 77 places with those of the unspent outputs of the PRC dice cold wallet and pushed the transaction to blockchain.info. The transaction was accepted, even though the signatures are for an entirely wrong set of outputs. That suggests that no signature validation is being done at all.
I often use blockchain.info to check if someone has paid me or not. So long as a decent fee was included I've been accepting 0-conf payments as soon as they show up on blockchain.info. I won't be doing that any more, since anyone can now fake a payment to any address.

Yeah. Hash rate tends to increase over time. Difficulty is only adjusted every 2016 blocks, so on average the difficulty is too easy, and blocks are mined too quickly.
We're currently on block 580171.
The halving in at block 210000*3 = 630000.
That's 49829 blocks away.

Every time you spend from an address you 'leak' its public key, even if you didn't reuse the address at all.
Whether you 'need' a new wallet or not depends on whether you've leaked your xpub. Leaking individual public keys isn't a problem so long as the corresponding addresses no longer hold any coins.
Peter's comment about using Electrum being a problem only applies if you've used it with a public Electrum server. If you only let it connect to your own Electrum server you're still OK.

I guess there must be other differences between the chains then, specifically in the rule about the number of sigops allowed per transaction.
Edit: I checked. It's not per transaction, but per block. Bitcoin only allows 80k sigops per block, whereas B2X allows 160k per block. So the plan is to create a transaction with 81k sigops because that will only be valid in a B2X block. Any BTC block containing it would be invalid.
See `MAX_BLOCK_SIGOPS_COST` in `src/consensus/consensus.h`.

Yes. It's like when you buy an Amazon gift card and give it to a friend. Amazon have the money the whole time. When someone redeems the code on the card Amazon transfer funds from their gift card account to the redeemer's account, but nothing really moved anywhere.
All you can do with the email is type the code into the exchange, and they'll give you the BTC back into your account, so it's no use for saving fees.
And no, it's not like offline storage at all. The coins are still held by the exchange. You will still lose out if the exchange gets hacked.

Moving all your Bitcoin to a single address could result in you having multiple utxos at the same address. For instance if I log in to 10 different exchanges and withdraw my balance, using the same address each time, I'll have moved all my Bitcoin to a single address, but I'll have 10 utxos, not 1. Similarly if I have 10 paper wallets, and I sweep them all to the same address, I'll probably sweep them one at a time and end up with 10 utxos at that address, not 1.
Just telling people "move all your BTC to the same address" doesn't mean they'll end up with a single output. It makes no different how many addresses they use. It's outputs that matter, not addresses.
A more useful instruction would be "consolidate all your BTC into a single output so it costs less to move it after the fork". That would make more sense than confusing people by talking about addresses.

Transactions with more than 80k sigops are only valid on the B2X chain and so cannot be replayed on the BTC chain at any point.


We are presumably splitting our coins so that we can spend/dump them, else why bother? And so while you're right that replaying the splitting transaction doesn't directly cause loss of funds, replaying any transactions which rely on the split transaction only existing on one chain could very well cause loss of funds.

By default your full node will share with its peers any blocks and any unconfirmed transactions it hears about.
This can use a lot of bandwidth, and so an option was added to have it only share blocks with its peers. This means it won't notify you of any incoming payments until they are confirmed, because it won't hear about the payment until it gets into a block. It also means that you can't directly send any payments using the node, because it won't broadcast the payment. If it did, your peers would be able to notice that you very rarely tell them about any transactions, and never ask them to send you any transactions. They could deduce that you were in blocksonly mode, and know that any transactions you did send them originated with you. You can still make transactions, but to get them broadcast you need to do it manually using a different node, or a service such as 
Edit: I see the behavior of not broadcasting any transactions you attempt to make is controlled by the `-walletbroadcast` option.
    -blocksonly
         Whether to reject transactions from network peers. Transactions from the
         wallet or RPC are not affected. (default: 0)
    -walletbroadcast
         Make the wallet broadcast transactions (default: 1)
The docs for `blocksonly` say that "Transactions from the wallet or RPC are not affected" but the code says:
    if (gArgs.GetBoolArg("-blocksonly", DEFAULT_BLOCKSONLY) &amp;&amp; gArgs.SoftSetBoolArg("-walletbroadcast", false)) {
        LogPrintf("%s: parameter interaction: -blocksonly=1 -&gt; setting -walletbroadcast=0
", __func__);
    }
which seems to contradict that.

The fees are regularly 1 satoshi per byte, or around $0.02 for a simple transaction. If you're not in a hurry to get your transaction confirmed during US business hours you should easily be able to get into a block paying just 5 cents or less. I know I do, especially over the weekend.

I disagree. Such a scenario means that I could huge amounts of data in the public blockchain and pay very little to do so. That is clearly an unworkable situation. You cannot offer unlimited permanent backups to everyone for free.
That was basically the crux of the whole block size debate: if block space on a secure chain is free there will be infinite demand for it, meaning nobody will be able to afford to run a full node, meaning the chain won't be secure.

I think the Ledger should be able to give you a SegWit address. I don't have one myself, but I hear they support SegWit now. I don't know if it'll default to giving SegWit addresses or if you need to request it somehow. You may need to upgrade the firmware or something too.
I would recommend storing your coins on the ledger for any significant amounts. The problem with holding them on GDAX is the same as with holding your money in a bank - the funds aren't really under your control at all. GDAX could (theoretically) decide at any point that they don't want to let you withdraw any more.

DCA is dollar cost averaging. It's where you buy a certain value of BTC at regular intervals, like $100 per month.
That way you end up buying more BTC when it's cheap than when it's expensive and so your average price tends to be lower than if you pick a single random point in time to buy.
Of course, if you think the price is going to trend upwards over time then it's better on average to buy as early as possible rather than spreading your buys over time.

They are both light wallets, requiring you to trust third parties to validate the chain for you.
Wasabi has better privacy. It uses client-side block filters which let the client decide which blocks to download without giving the server information about why you're downloading those particular blocks. It also has CoinJoin built in, allowing you to 'mix' your coins with other wasabi users for better privacy.
Electrum is more mature, stable code. Wasabi is relatively new. The Electrum client requires the use of dedicated Electrum servers to work, and those servers get to know which addresses belong to you, damaging your privacy.
A better choice if you can is to run Bitcoin Core. It will download and validate every block, so you don't need to trust any third party. It uses a lot (~250 GB) of disk space unless you turn on block pruning, in which case it uses less than 5 GB. Either way it will download about 250 GB of block data when you first run it.

Each miner makes his own list of transactions that he's trying to mine. The lists will be pretty similar, because they will all want to be including the transactions with the highest fee per byte. Note that the first transaction in each block is the block reward transaction, and it is allowed to create 12.5 BTC out of thin air to reward the miner. Each miner will have a different first transaction in the block they're trying to mine, since each will be paying themselves, each to a different address.
If multiple miners all find a block at the same time, they'll all broadcast those blocks but they'll all have the same block height. Everyone will move on to trying to mine the next block. Each block references the previous block by hash, so each miner will need to pick one of the 3 previous blocks to mine on top of. One of those miners will "win", and whichever block he has chosen to mine on top of will be considered part of the main chain, and the other 2 will be "orphaned".

You use the offline machine to sign a transaction. It puts a signature on each of the inputs of the transaction you are signing. There are an almost infinite number of valid signatures for each input. The malware on your airgapped machine can choose which of the many valid signatures to use, and that choice can be interpreted by the malware's author when you broadcast the signed transaction from the online machine.
Using this kind of mechanism, the malware on the airgapped machine can communicate messages to its author. The signed transaction ends up being broadcast, at which point everyone can see it.

You can put "prune=1000" in your bitcoin.conf file (in the same folder as your wallet.dat) then restart bitcoin core and it will prune its copy of the blockchain so it only uses 1 GB instead of 250 GB.
You don't need to sync the chain at all if all you want to do is export the private key and import it into electrum.
The console's "dumpprivkey" command should be able to give you the key you need. Make sure you're giving it the correct address. Can you look the address up on a block explorer such as blockstream.info? That should show you whether the transaction exists or not.
When importing the private key into Electrum, precede it with `p2wpkh-p2sh:` so Electrum knows to use the p2sh-segwit version of the address.

Tony Vays isn't very technical and doesn't seem to understand the tech very well. I wouldn't take advice from him about how to split coins.
Specifically, step 1 doesn't do anything. He suggests moving all your coins to the same address, but there's no reason to do that.
All you need to do is steps 3 and 4. Step 3 will give you an output which isn't valid on the real BTC chain, and step 4 will combine that output with all your other outputs, resulting in a new output that isn't valid on the BTC chain.
There's still the possibility that the output you received in step 3 becomes valid on the BTC chain due to a reorg, depending on how Coinbase created it.

You only need to pay 10 satoshis per byte and your transaction gets confirmed eventually. I made a transaction yesterday for 20 satoshis per byte consolidating my four dust outputs into a single output. The transaction was around 750 bytes and cost just 65 cents. I got lucky, and it took less than a minute to confirm.
Fees can be higher during week days, but if you're OK with waiting until the mempool is less busy you can get your transactions confirmed pretty cheaply.

Before block pruning was implemented all full nodes downloaded and stored all the Bitcoin blocks. Currently that's over 200 GB, and growing by over 150 MB per day.
Now 200 GB of disk space is pretty cheap but not everyone is happy to "waste" so much disk space, so block pruning was implemented.
With block pruning enabled you download each block in turn, process it, then throw almost all of it away and keep a database of just the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). So you're still downloading over 200 GB of block data but you're not storing most of it. You configure the client to keep just the last 1 GB of blocks or some such.
This database of UTXOs is currently over 3 GB in size, and tends to grow over time. In order to run a full node right now you need to maintain an up to date copy of this 3 GB database because otherwise you have no way of knowing whether the transactions in the each block you receive are spending real unspent outputs or if they are double-spending old outputs, or even attempting to spend completely made up outputs.
Utreexo is a new idea intended to allow anyone to run a full node without having to store this 3 GB database of unspent transaction outputs. Instead all you need to store is approximately 1000 bytes of data, representing a collection (or 'forest') of 25 or so merkle tree roots. The idea is that rather than the full nodes keeping a list of all 6 million unspent outputs that exist, transactions themselves are extended to include proofs that each input they are spending exists in the UTXO set, and the nodes can use its forest of tree roots along with the proofs provided in the transactions to check that the outputs are real and unspent.
No existing wallet knows how to provide such proofs, and so at first "bridge nodes" are used which have the full 3 GB UTXO set stored and which collect proof-less transactions they see on the network, calculate the required proofs, and rebroadcast them on the network for utreexo nodes to use.
The upshot of all this is that you can run a fully validating node using just a few thousand bytes of storage rather than the 3 GB it currently requires. You still need to do the full &gt;200 GB initial block download unless you trust a node that has already done the initial sync, in which case you can copy its state and have the new node instantly be synced, with no download or CPU use required.
Edit: I just noticed my tldr needs a tldr of its own.
tldr: It lets you run a full node without needing to use more than a tiny amount of disk space.

How about putting the majority of your coins into a wallet with seed phrase  and passphrase 
That way if either  or  are discovered you will know about it (as the corresponding decoy wallet will presumably be emptied) but your main stash is OK unless someone finds both  and 
As has already been pointed out you can't take 12 words from one phrase and 12 words from another and expect to get a valid 24 word seed. You have a 1 in 256 chance of the Frankenstein phrase begin valid.
I guess you could choose a few hundred different  and only keep the one that makes a valid phrase when you take half of  and half of  but my previous suggestion of using  as the seed phrase and  as the optional passphrase is less work.

The idea is new to me too, but I don't see why that wouldn't work.
I don't know how many bits you can leak per signature, but signatures are 71 to 73 bytes long whereas private keys are only 32 bytes. It looks to me like signatures are effective two 32 byte numbers (`r` and `s`). `r` doesn't depend on the message being signed and can be controlled by the signer, but only in a generate-and-test kind of way. So to leak 20 bytes in the `r` value I'd need to do around 2^20 elliptic curve multiplications to find an `r` with the correct first 20 bits.

If the corporate takeover succeeds, you'll be left with 7k worthless BTC and none of the new B2X coins. But if Bitcoin wins, you'll have increased your holdings by about 16%.

Not double, no. Because the B2X coins aren't worth more than 15% of the current price of BTC right now, and will likely go down from there. You can see the market [here](

Thousands of people with Coinbase accounts already own BCH. Around the end of the year they will have access to them for the first time. That doesn't create new holders - they're already holders because they're forced to be.

This was never an upgrade. To do an upgrade you need consensus. This was a contentious hard fork without replay protection.
Your plan would end up having your transactions confirmed on both chains, giving your customers' BTC away without permission when they only wanted to dump their BCH.

@_date: 2017-11-30 21:30:21
1. It often doesn't show transactions until they are confirmed. I will send people money and they'll tell me I haven't sent it, because they're using blockchain.info's explorer to check. I tell them to use any other explorer instead, and then they see it. So it's a technical concern.
2. They can use their web server logs to tie your addresses to your IP address. Most people looking up BTC addresses are pretty closely related to those addresses. So it's a privacy concern.
3. blockchain.info is one of Roger Ver's companies. He's pretty much abandoned Bitcoin these days and is actively pumped an altcoin, attempting to take over the Bitcoin brand. I don't support such activity, and so avoid using his companies. So it's a political concern.

Basically you're sending a list of the pre-existing utxo's you're spending and a list of the new outputs you're creating. Each utxo you're spending specifies its txid, output number within that tx, and a signature proving you have the right to spend that utxo. Each new output you're creating specifies its value and a script that must be satisfied before it can be spent by its new owner.
You don't specify a fee. The fee is calculated as (sum of inputs) minus (sum of outputs).
There are a few other bits and pieces. There's a version field, to allow for upgrades. There's a locktime field, to prevent transactions being mined into a block until some time in the future. I think it's also used to signal replace-by-fee. There is a per-output sequence number that has something to do with timelocking individual outputs. But mostly a transaction is just a list of inputs and outputs.

This isn't true. You are assuming the fee stays at 10 satoshis per byte as the price of a satoshi rises, but I don't see why that would necessarily be the case.
If the blocks are big enough that there aren't enough transactions paying 10 sat/B to fill them then miners will start accepting transactions which pay less per byte in fees.
You're trying to make the point that increasing the blocksize limit doesn't decrease fees, but it does. The problems with increasing the blocksize are that it:
1. isn't possible without consensus (ie. it creates a new altcoin), and
2. leads to a reduction in the number of full nodes (ie. it reduces decentralization, making the coin more vulnerable to attackers)

@_date: 2016-02-03 08:58:05
Yes, but only linearly so.
The problem is that you have to hash the whole transaction (68 kB) 463 times (once per input).
So when you have 100 inputs then transaction is 100 times bigger than when you have 1 input (roughly), and you also have to hash it 100 times rather than once, so you have to do 10,000 times more work than for a single transaction.
The work grows according to the *square* of the number of inputs.

Again, it depends how you define the block size. SegWit is a soft fork. That means that it does not remove the existing 1MB blocksize limit rule. If it did, that would be a hard fork.

See RHavar's reply to me. We can't stop the rogue miner from trying to make a new block 400001, but we can stop him from including any newer transactions in it, since they will all have a locktime of 400001 and so can only be included in block 400002 or later. This way the rogue miner has to choose between trying to snipe the old transactions fee, or collecting fees from new transactions. He can't take both.

For those who prefer words over pictures, here's the text - it doesn't appear for me on the .com site, but I found it in Google's cache:
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT
Bitcoin.com is of the opinion that the current "Bitcoin Core + Blockstream" Bitcoin development team is not taking satisfactory steps to ensure the growth and advancement of Bitcoin in accordance with Satoshi's original white paper, and is in fact actively harming the health of the Bitcoin economy by stifling efforts to solve some of Bitcoin’s most pressing problems.
Rather than viewing Bitcoin as a fast, affordable, and reliable payments network, as it has been for years, they aim to transform Bitcoin into what they call "a settlement layer", defined by high fees, unreliable transactions, and a labyrinth of complex overlays that require third-party trust on top of the basic system.
This development team has further prevented the ability of the Bitcoin community to freely discuss this radical change of direction by tacitly, and in some cases explicitly, supporting censorship of Bitcoin's largest discussion forums, along with the outright banning of many prominent developers, businesses, and community members who have differences of opinion with Bitcoin Core's current roadmap. After years of stagnation, stalling, and broken promises, it has become clear that positive change will not come from Bitcoin Core, but rather from the diverse group of alternate development teams that have emerged as a result of Core's tactics.
The following article cites a thorough history with specific examples of the rampant censorship on the "r/bitcoin" sub-reddit:
* A (Brief and Incomplete) History of Censorship in r/bitcoin, by John Blocke
As efforts by the community to resolve these problems have failed, it is necessary to resolve them with a different approach:
* By unsubscribing to and subscribing to sub-reddit \r\btc you take a stand against censorship.
* By running an alternate implementation, such as Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic, or Bcoin, you are casting a vote against the current development team.
There are currently cryptocurrencies which perform better than Bitcoin, have more features than Bitcoin, have a more receptive and open development team than Bitcoin, and have a better upgrade path than Bitcoin. The single and only remaining quality that Bitcoin has over these other cryptocurrencies is first-mover advantage and its pre-existing network of users and infrastructure. If these qualities are not preserved, Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to competing cryptocurrencies.
The current Bitcoin Core developers are rapidly eroding this last advantage with poor design choices, a failure to understand basic economic principles, and promoting censorship through their support of censored discussion forums and their vilification of forums committed to free speech.
We encourage all members of the Bitcoin community to make their voices heard, and to stand up for what is right.

I don't see why there wouldn't be a few big LN nodes with lots of channels open.
Coins that are in use on a payment channel are tied up, unable to be used for anything else. So if you usually keep 100 BTC in your hot wallet, and commit 50 BTC to LN payment channels, you'll need to have 150 BTC in your wallet if you want to keep 100 BTC available to server as a hot wallet. In other words, the same coin cannot be used as a hot-wallet coin *and* a LN coin at the same time.
I think OP's concern is valid: if a box running an unlocked wallet is hacked then the coins on that box can be stolen.

SegWit is a solution to the scaling problem which doesn't require a hard fork. If some miners fork off onto a new chain there's nothing we can do to stop them. They'll realize the mistake they have made at some point. The fact remains that there is a solution to the scaling problem which doesn't require breaking backwards compatibility with old clients.


XT and Classic have already failed. BU is pretty much a joke at this point after seeing the comedy of errors surrounding the project. I don't know what the next attack will be but I don't see it being any more successful than the previous three.


A hard fork plus segwit seems like the worst of both worlds. For SegWit supporters it's no use because it's a contentious hard fork which is no good for anyone. For "big blockers" it's no good because "SegWit is too complex and technical debt and borgstream core and AXA and economic code and waaaaah".


I've not checked yet today, but as of yesterday it had been avoided so far. There is almost no support for a hard fork. It would be economic suicide for a big mining pool to try forcing a hard fork, so I really don't think it will happen.

I didn't define what an attack is, so that's not true.
It is very clear to me that when 51% of the hashrate deliberately orphans blocks created by the rest of the hashrate in an attempt to stop people using the chain, that is an attack.
I don't see how SW could be interpreted as an attack. It doesn't stop anyone using Bitcoin.


All soft forks are backwards compatible. That's what "soft fork" means.
Older nodes don't know about segwit transactions at all. Their users won't be using segwit. The fact that old nodes can't verify segwit transactions isn't a problem for the users of old nodes because those users won't be receiving segwit transactions. The old nodes will continue verifying old style transactions which is all that the users of old nodes will be receiving.

Not really. It costs more in transaction fees to spend those outputs than they are worth. If I remember correctly, each input contributes 147.5 bytes to the size of the transaction if the address uses a compressed pubkey, and 179.5 bytes if the pubkey isn't compressed. The transaction fee is 100 bits per 1000 bytes, or 0.1 bits per byte. So each inputs costs at least 14.7 bits in transaction fees to spend.
Unless, of course, the transaction qualifies for no fee. But that's only the case if the priority (age * size) is high enough. With tiny valued inputs you need a lot of age, or some larger older inputs [along for the ride](
I think I remember some talk about making it cheaper to spend such 'dust', but can't find it now. While searching I did find [this post]( which says much the same as my opening paragraph.

Somebody should make a site now that lets you split your coins into Classic and Core, and trade them.
Imagine: you deposit 1 BTC and it credits you 1 Core and 1 Classic. You (a Core believer) put your Classic coin up for sale, asking for 1.1 Cores in exchange. A market forms, like the market for BTC/USD at a regular exchange.
You eventually find a buyer, and now have 2.1 Corecoin (minus a small fee, I guess) and 0 Classiccoin.
After the fork, you can withdraw your 2.1 Corecoin, and the guy you traded with can withdraw his 2.1 Classiccoin. You're both happy, since you're a Core-believer and doubled your Core holdings, and he's a Class-believer and almost doubled his Classic holdings.
Does such a service exist? If not, why not?
I can see the site would have to be careful to define its T&amp;C explicitly. What exactly constitutes the Classic chain, in the event that there are multiple hardforks? How long after the fork are people allowed to withdraw? What if the Classic fork never triggers, due to the 75% threshold never being met. Do the people who sold their Corecoin for Classiccoin lose out? Or are all trades cancelled? At which point can we declare that the Classic fork "never" happened. After a year of failure? What if after a year Gavin tries yet again to fork Bitcoin, with a ClassicExtraCoin, where he only needs 51% support to fork. Does that count as a Classic fork? Suppose Core loses, ends up with 10% of the mining power, and changes its mining algorithm and/or difficulty to keep the block rate high enough. That's another hard fork. Are Core balances available for withdrawal on all Core chains? Only the original one?
So there are lots of open questions, but I think a service like this would be a great way of gauging where the true economic majority support lies.

If Classic activates its fork then there will be "Classic" and there will still be Bitcoin. What makes you think Bitcoin would disappear if Classic activates its hard fork?
When Classic fails to convince 75% of the hashrate to switch over, they'll likely drop the requirement to 51%, or use checkpoints, or do whatever they can in an attempt to "succeed". But however they do it, it still won't be Bitcoin. It will be a crappy fork. Bitcoin will still exist.
@_date: 2016-02-06 17:51:27
I think the point is that people will initially think the Classic coins are worth about 1 BTC each, so if you can split your pre-fork coins and dump your Classic coins for 1 (real) BTC each, you have effectively doubled your (real) BTC holdings.
It's a gamble, of course. If the copy/paste Toomim coin really does take over and Core coins become worthless then you've doubled your holding of a worthless coin, and sold all your valuable Toomims. But in that universe you could probably have your magic unicorn shit out some gold bricks to recoup your losses.

The fundamental problem with brain wallets is that the amount of entropy you can reliably store in your brain is lower than the amount of entropy that can be brute-force attacked by a well funded attacker.
In other words if you make the passphrase too long, you will forget it, but if you make it short enough to remember you also make it short enough to be hacked.
Edit: maybe you're thinking of writing down the passphrase and storing it in a safe or something. That's fine, but then it's no longer a brain wallet.
Edit2: if you're picking characters randomly from a set of 64 characters (ie. A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and two other symbols) then each character gives you 6 bits of entropy. (2^6 = 64). 30 such characters give you 180 bits of entropy, which is plenty, especially when you consider that there are only 2^160 different regular Bitcoin addresses.

Wallets can't access each other. That's not what I'm saying.
Transactions propagate through the network in the same way that blocks do. Every node sees every transaction just as they see every block.


If you're talking about "light (SPV) wallets", there's something called a "[bloom filter]( which the wallet uses to give the node it is connected to a way to know which transactions it might be interested in without giving the node a definitive list of addresses.


Yes. It checks each incoming transaction against the bloom filters its wallet clients have given it. Each one that matches a bloom filter is sent to the corresponding light (SPV) wallet.

Have you looked at JoinMarket? It seems pretty similar to LN in some respects.
It's a market for "coinjoin" transactions. Nodes offering conjoins need to keep their coins online all the time, and set their own fees. People taking coinjoin offers tend to favor the lower fee offers.
Despite the risk of leaving your wallet online 24/7 there is a healthy market forming, with very low fees.
Check out  for instance. I just looked and found 2 offers to coinjoin up to 100 BTC each for a 0.00002% fee. Those nodes are likely never going to make enough to cover their expenses even, yet they are still running.

Another nice property of the n-dimensional tree is that it is obvious which points can be reached from the current point. You find the right-most zero in the binary form of the current index, and can reach all points with indices arrived at by changing the bits to the right of that zero. Every sub-tree has `2^n - 1` nodes in it, for some `n`.
So if we're at 23 (`0b10111`) we can reach all points from twiddling the last 3 bits - ie 16 (`0b10000`) through 23 (`0b10111`).
To answer "can we reach `w` from `i`?" we just need to see whether `w` and `i` are identical up to the right-most `0` bit in `i`.
You're using
* left-hash: `hash(parent)` (reduces index by `2^h`) and
* right-hash: `hash(parent, 1)` (reduces index by `1`)
as your two hash operators.
For the n-dimensional tree we only need one operation:
* n-hash: `hash(parent, n)` (reduces index by `2^n`),
which can only be used if bit `n` of the parent's index is set. I think it's simpler and more efficient than the reverse merkle tree - there's only one kind of hash operation instead of two.

I don't see how setting locktime equal to the next block prevents such sniping.
I checked the source code:
    // Discourage fee sniping.
    //
    // For a large miner the value of the transactions in the best block and
    // the mempool can exceed the cost of deliberately attempting to mine two
    // blocks to orphan the current best block. By setting nLockTime such that
    // only the next block can include the transaction, we discourage this
    // practice as the height restricted and limited blocksize gives miners
    // considering fee sniping fewer options for pulling off this attack.
    //
    // A simple way to think about this is from the wallet's point of view we
    // always want the blockchain to move forward. By setting nLockTime this
    // way we're basically making the statement that we only want this
    // transaction to appear in the next block; we don't want to potentially
    // encourage reorgs by allowing transactions to appear at lower heights
    // than the next block in forks of the best chain.
    //
    // Of course, the subsidy is high enough, and transaction volume low
    // enough, that fee sniping isn't a problem yet, but by implementing a fix
    // now we ensure code won't be written that makes assumptions about
    // nLockTime that preclude a fix later.
    txNew.nLockTime = chainActive.Height();
    // Secondly occasionally randomly pick a nLockTime even further back, so
    // that transactions that are delayed after signing for whatever reason,
    // e.g. high-latency mix networks and some CoinJoin implementations, have
    // better privacy.
    if (GetRandInt(10) == 0)
        txNew.nLockTime = std::max(0, (int)txNew.nLockTime - GetRandInt(100));
So if the current best block is 400000 when we send a transaction, we set the nLockTime on the transaction to 400000, which means the transaction cannot be included in any block with height less than 400001.
Our transaction has a huge fee and gets mined in block 400001. A rogue miner decides they want the fee, so they try to mine a new block 400001. Our nLockTime doesn't stop them doing that. All it does is stops them from putting in it a new block 400000 or lower, but they wouldn't be wanting to do that anyway as far as I can see.
Also, is this a typo?


It's not clear what they're trying to say, but it doesn't sound right to me. Maybe "height restriction"?

OK so you are spreading the bandwidth over time rather than having it peak every 10 minutes, but the total throughput is the same, and much higher than it is currently.
What is there to stop an attacker submitting the same transaction 16 times, once to each sub-block? He only pays the fee once, but gets a 16x magnifier on his DoS attack. He can ensure blocks are full relatively cheaply, and so make sure that the number of sub-blocks increases every 100 blocks for fixed cost. In doing this he quickly cripples the network.

The rule:


UASF is a soft fork. It doesn't result in any blocks being accepted that wouldn't already be accepted by the consensus rules.
And SegWit already has overwhelming consensus. The vast majority of nodes support it. The economic majority support it. Most wallets and exchanges are ready for it.

Each hub sets its own fee.


It can't be. It is built on top of Bitcoin and so cannot be safer than it.


Each payment channel is opened by getting a Bitcoin transaction into a Bitcoin block. Then payments happen on the channel by the two ends of the channel exchanging unconfirmed transactions, which they mostly never even try to get into a block, but which they can use to close the channel if they want to.


Because most LN transactions never need to go into a block.


It's a layer on top of Bitcoin, and depends upon Bitcoin to work.

Funds sent to compressed addresses don't merge with funds sent to the corresponding uncompressed address. They are two separate addresses as far as the network is concerned.

Suppose I deposit a Bitcoin to Coinbase now, and try to withdraw it in some magical future in which the Classic fork actually goes live.
Coinbase will only send me 1 Classic coin, and no real Bitcoin, claiming that this Classic coin thing is the "new Bitcoin" or some such.
I have 'lost' my Bitcoin because a third party I trusted drank the Klassic Koolaid. The coin isn't really lost of course, but Coinbase now own it. Once the mist clears and everyone regains their senses, Coinbase is left owning my Bitcoin and all I have is a worthless dead forkcoin.

What is this nonsense? "Bitcoin Core + Blockstream"? Some of the Core developers are funded by Blockstream, and many are funded by other companies. Some aren't funded at all.


Core proposed Segregated Witness, which is the most promising improvement I'm aware of. It fixes many of the existing problems with the protocol, is a stop-gap effective blocksize increase, and paves the way for enormous scaling in the future.


The efforts you are referring to are dangerous hard forks which make an already bad centralized mining problem much much worse.


This is nonsense. Core's plan is to keep the base layer as secure and decentralized as possible while allowing safe trustless almost-free offchain transactions to be layered on top of it. "Scaling" by simply making the blocks bigger whenever they get full isn't really scaling at all. Scaling implies increasing the throughput without correspondingly increasing the resource requirements. Making the blocks ever bigger isn't safe. Using off-chain solutions is clearly the better solution to the scaling problem.


The development team doesn't have any control over discussion forums. The people who do have control for the most part don't want to see your dangerous anti-Bitcoin propaganda, and so disallow it from their forums. I don't have a problem with that. Go spread your lies elsewhere.


How do you "ban" a developer? Mike Hearn quit of his own free will. Gavin lost his commit privs after a year or so of inactivity but is still allowed to contribute to the project.


Positive change is constantly coming from the Core project. Just check the release notes of any recent release. Huge amounts of work are ongoing, with real tangible improvements in every release. If it wasn't for big miner blocking of SegWit we would already have a much more functional Bitcoin.


Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. Nobody denies that. Call it censorship if you like. I call it moderation.




\r\btc is a cesspoll of lies and hate. I lose several IQ posts each time I visit. No thanks.


BU is poorly developed and has already been found to have multiple critical bugs in its official releases.


They perform better than Bitcoin because they are mostly unused. If they ever gain widespread use they will face the same scaling problems that Bitcoin is currently facing.


So stop blocking progress. Get out of the way of the experts who understand the system.

SegWit keeps the 1MB limit on the blocksize, but allows an extra few MB of signature data in a separate structure outside of the block.
So in one sense (the sense that old nodes care about) the consensus rule of limiting blocks to 1MB isn't broken.
But in another sense (the sense that it allows roughly double the transaction throughput) the blocks are effectively "bigger".

A fork is a chain split. It changes the rules and miners are free to decide whether to accept the changed rules or not. In doing so they decide which side of the fork to mine on.
In a soft fork the old miners' chain gets repeatedly orphaned each time it splits off so long as there is majority support for the fork.

The difference is that it *is* backwards compatible. That's what makes it a soft fork and not a hard fork.
If a soft-fork gains the support of &gt;51% of the hashrate, old clients will automatically reorg to the soft-forked branch.
If a hard-fork gains the support of &gt;51% of the hashrate, old clients will be stuck on the original branch.
So a soft-fork doesn't require old clients to upgrade whereas a hard fork does.

Did you ever look at a dictionary? This isn't what definitions look like.
I definition would be something like:
FUD: An exclamation used by supporters of scams as an alternative to actually mounting a defense in the face of logical argument; anything that makes a scam look bad.


As I understand it, 'Classic' is 99% the same as Core, but with the blocksize limit raised. So its developers are pretty much the same people as Core's developers. The people I worry about are the ones using 'Classic' (strange name for a new version of something; 'classic' usually implies something about being old) to promote their dodgy centralized voting site and attempting to weaken Bitcoin however they can.


So why pick 75%, when all previous successful forks have used a much higher definition of "super majority"?
It remains to be seen what the big-block supporters do next. Their 20 MB XT failed to gain popular support, as did their 8 MB XT. Now their 2MB 'Classic' is failing too. So what next? Do you really think they'll just give up now and admit defeat? I don't. I think they've only just started.

LN is primarily designed for small transactions. Channels don't need to be "big" to be useful. I would happily put up a node with a few hundred BTC available to open channels with and I'm sure many others would too.


Nobody is suggesting that anyone put all their coins online to run a LN node. Big holders could put just 1% of their coins online on a LN node and keep the other 99% in cold storage.


BitFinex is a good example of this. They have a lending market. Anyone can take coins out of their personal cold storage, deposit them to BitFinex, and lend them out for people to margin trade with. The interest rate they get for doing this is determined by a market. In exchange for risking my coins in the hands of a third party I get 0.038% interest per day. That is what the market has decided is the current interest rate. LN would work similarly. A fee market would emerge as a result of competition. The tx fees would be determined by competition between LN nodes.






The fee schedule would be up to the individual nodes, though it does seem likely that fees would be a percentage of the amount transferred. I don't see that as a problem when LN is intended to give small transactions somewhere to exist.


Yes, there's a trade off. This isn't a drawback on LN.


And so LN gives the customer more choice. Do they want trustless-for-a-fee or trusted-for-free? That's up to them to decide.
You don't seem to be presenting any drawbacks here. Why don't you think Lightning would help with scaling Bitcoin? It allows many times more "coffee sized" transactions to happen in a trustless manner than on-chain scaling alone would allow.


Nobody thinks it is magic. It is just a good scaling solution for small transactions.

I've not studied it extensively, but it does seem to be showing a lot of promise.


Nobody is forcing it. It is entirely opt-in. SegWit alone roughly doubles the transaction throughput and paves the way for more efficient use of the block space. Why would you want to increase the base blocksize limit before optimizing the use of the current space?


Bitcoin's main advantage against the other cryptos is its security. People trust Bitcoin to keep their wealth secure. The nearest competitor to Bitcoin not long ago did a consentious hard fork to take coins from one contract and give them to a group of rich investors who had invested in a faulty contract. That isn't an ecosystem I would want to be involved in. I want to be able to trust my crypto of choice to be secure against interference from well funded attackers. That is what we are seeing from Bitcoin. Roger with his thousands of BTC is unable to get support for his dangerous hard fork. And that's a good thing.


As I understand it "Core" never signed up for the Hong Kong agreement. And didn't one of the miners break the agreement first anyway by running BU after agreeing not to?


You can't increase on-chain capacity without hard forking. Hard forking isn't safe without consensus. We don't have consensus for a hard fork. SegWit however roughly doubles the effective blocksize safely.


I didn't see any justification for why a hard fork is the right path forward. Did you give any? It sounds as if your argument is "Core doesn't want to commit to a dangerous hard fork, therefore a hard fork is the right thing to do" - but I don't see how that follows.

That's a good definition. To phrase it more simply: a soft fork adds new restrictions whereas a hard fork removes old restrictions.


If any Core node considered any BIP48 block invalid, you would be right. But that isn't the case. Every block that is valid under BIP148 is also valid under the regular Bitcoin consensus rules that Core accepts. That is trivially true since the only difference between the two sets of rules is that BIP148 adds a rule saying "during a certain date range reject blocks which don't signal for segwit if segwit isn't already activated". BIP148's rules are strictly a superset of the regular rules, and so all BIP148 blocks are valid under the regular rule set.


OK, there's your misunderstanding. A block is "valid" if it follows the rules. I can mine a block on top of block 450000 right now relatively easily. It will have a block height of 450001, and it will be considered valid by all Bitcoin nodes. No nodes would reorg to it, because it wouldn't be on the chain with the biggest amount of work on it, but it *would* still be valid.
So in order to understand the definition you quoted, you need to understand what is meant by "only previously valid blocks/transactions are made *invalid*". To be "made invalid" there means "made to break the rules". It's nothing about which chain is the longest. That is irrelevant when considering which blocks are valid and which aren't.
Thanks for sticking with the discussion long enough for us to figure out where exactly you were confused.


Whether you see it as a 51% attack or a soft fork is up to you. They're pretty much the same thing.
Gavin was recently musing on how best to destroy the small block chain after BU forks away from it. He proposed orphaning any blocks on the small chain which included transactions with empty blocks. That looks like a 51% attack to me, but you could also describe it as a soft fork - all he is doing is adding a new rule: "no block can have more than one transaction (the coinbase tx)" - that perfectly fits the quoted definition of a soft fork after all.

What the Core client calls sat/kilobyte is exactly 1000 times what the website calls sat/vbyte, because the Core client really means "virtual kilobyte" when it says "kilobyte".
So when the website says to pay 99 sat/vbyte, that means you need to tell the Core client to pay 99,000 sat per kilobyte (or 990 bits per kilobyte if that's easier - set the units to 'bits' and multiply the website's number by 10).

The blockchain is a permanent uneditable record. It can be used to prove that the article existed at a particular point in time - specifically that it existed before your competition copied it.
I don't know what you do if the competition copy it and change the date to be just before the date of your transaction however:
* Jan 20: I write an article, hash it, publish the hash on the blockchain, publish the article.
* Jan 21: Competitor copies the article, changes the date to "Jan 19", publishes it, claims I copied them.

I imagine there will be both public and private sidechains. I see no reason why there wouldn't be invite-only or encrypted sidechains.
LN as I understand it is a way of creating a payment channel between two parties (using an on-chain transaction) which then allows funds to pass between those two parties in both directions multiple times (without needing to use the blockchain) until the channel is closed (using an on-chain transaction).
So opening the channel takes 1 tx, closing it takes 1 tx, but you can have an unlimited number of transactions happening on the transaction without using the blockchain at all. Those transactions can be entirely private with only the two involved parties knowing about them.

I'm not familiar with bitfinex, but poloniex has a similar system. There's a loan market, where lenders compete to offer the lowest rate:
Currently the lowest offer is 0.11% per day. The site takes 15% of the interest as a fee.
There's no limit on how much you can offer to lend. The limiting factor is that there is a finite demand for borrowing.
Sometimes there's very little competition between lenders and the rates go up to over 2% or 3% per day.
Yes, that's non-sensical, but it happens. A few days ago I loaned out 20 million DOGE for a day at around  2% interest and made 406k DOGE after fees.

I think you meant PoS, right? Proof of stake?
The "nothing at stake" problem is a reference to the fact that you don't need to have a stake in a PoS coin to rewrite its history. All you need is to have had a significant stake at some point in the past. You can use that historical stake to rewrite history from that point forward. Obviously you would omit the transaction in which you sold your significant stake.

The train analogy on that page is weird:
If you're at place C, and see a train that goes from A to B to C to D, you shouldn't say "that train just came *from* B" because then people might get on it thinking it would go back to B. Instead you should say "the last place that train went to before it came here was B". Because somehow that removes confusion?
As far as I can see, the last place the train went to before it came here is *the same* as the place the train just came from. Kind of by the definition of "from".
Is it a bad analogy, or is the whole distinction just silly?

Cryptolution made a good but angry rebuttal to your post. You seem to have missed his points because of his angry language. Here's my attempt at removing the emotion while keeping the points themselves:


Only because you are not familiar with all of the relevant facts.


False dichotomy, witness data requires less resources so of course its going to be treated preferably. It fixes a long problem with bitcoins UTXO cost matrix. It always amazes me when people argue against positive enhancements.


Also false. coindance shows 65 companies ready and 72 in support. So 95% of the industry has already migrated to support it. That means that we will see an immediate effect as soon as it activates. If miners would stop blocking it from being activated we could prove this rather quickly, but instead we have to deal with people complaining about problems while opposing the solutions.


This one is merely concern trolling. You do realize that satoshi himself advocated for softforks and we've had many which have gotten us where we are today?


No, people who have spent their lives pursuing a professional career and have the experience within this industry do. Not me, not you, not anyone else. They have reached consensus years ago on this issue.
None of these are rational arguments and they all lack basic comprehension of the system. They are not rational because they are not founded in knowledge. They are instead founded in assumptions and misinformation coupled with outright propaganda.
Sorry but you appear not to be very well informed. Let's examine the facts -
Hard forks:
* The version message checksum change on Feb 20, 2012. This is sometimes not considered a real hard fork because old nodes could theoretically still connect to the network via a specially-designed proxy -- the format of the block chain wasn't actually changed.
* BIP 50. This is sometimes not considered a hard fork because the old behavior that was changed was non-deterministic.
* 
Soft forks that come to mind:
* Max block size &amp; max sigops per block
* Huge changes in Script (removal of many opcodes; changes in how Script is processed)
* Fix for the output overflow bug
* P2SH (BIP 16)
* BIP 34-BIP 66 (softfork in progress)
* 
There might have been more. (Changes without BIPs were done by Satoshi.)
Clearly there is much more historical data to support the "clean upgrade" path softforks bring vs hard forks.

Why wouldnt he have the private key of it? He said it is his LTC address, which implies he does have the private key, but that it is in his LTC wallet. Couldn't he just import the private key into his BTC wallet?
The address begins with a '3', which means it's some kind of P2SH type thing. I suspect that the funds are retrievable if he generates an address in his BTC wallet with the same script as in his LTC wallet.
Of course, it's possible that when he says "my LTC address" he really means "some third party's LTC address with whom I have an account", in which case he won't have the corresponding private key, but the third party will.

I don't understand your solution.
Why would it be any quicker to send a group of 16 1 MB blocks than it would to send a single 16 MB block?
As a full node I need a copy of the entire blockchain. At the moment I am downloading 1 MB every 10 minutes and uploading it 5 or so times.
With your change I would be downloading multiple 1 MB blocks every `10 minutes, increasing my bandwidth requirement significantly.
Worse, you seem to be proposing a change where the same transaction can be in multiple sub-blocks. That increases further the amount of data I need to download and upload every 10 minutes.
And worse still you've built in up to a 20% increase every 100 blocks. 20% per day exponential growth in bandwidth requirement is a huge DoS vector.
Am I missing something? What advantage does your proposal bring?

SegWit *is* the compromise. It effectively increases the block size limit without causing a hard fork. It is already the best of both worlds.
The proposed "soft fork plus hard fork" is ridiculous. The whole point of SegWit is that it avoids a hard fork. If we're going to hard fork anyway then we don't need SegWit implemented as a soft fork.

Your tiny spends will likely be seen on the Core chain too, and so RBF may well be required.
@_date: 2016-02-27 17:19:48
From `src/policy/rbf.cpp`:
    bool SignalsOptInRBF(const CTransaction &amp;tx)
    {
        BOOST_FOREACH(const CTxIn &amp;txin, tx.vin) {
            if (txin.nSequence &lt; std::numeric_limits&lt;unsigned int&gt;::max()-1) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
So it's RBF if *any* input has a sequence number strictly less than max()-1. Max is `...FFFF`, max-1 is `...FFFE`, so to be RBF the sequence number needs to be less than `...FFFE`.

When the Core client talks about "fee per kilobyte" it really means "fee per virtual kilobyte", so there actually is no distinction.

Classic has different consensus rules than Bitcoin. That makes it a fork. If they can't get 75% of miners to adopt it, they'll change the rules, again, until it gets adopted. The previous similar attempt at weakening Bitcoin promised to use checkpoints to force the fork if it couldn't gain popular support.


Right. That was a soft fork not a contentious hard fork.

Note that the nonce field is only 32 bits wide, and so there are only 4 billion possible nonces. That's how many of these 1-byte-per-block sha3-512 hashes miners will have to know if they want to mine using the full 32 bit nonce.
As I understand it, there's very little room in the header other than the nonce for changing bits. You can tinker with the time field a little, but not too much. So once you have tested the 4 billion different nonces you need to change something in the transaction list to change the merkle tree hash. Typically miners will change some bytes in the coinbase transaction called the extranonce. This requires recalculating the merkle tree root.
 has a good explanation.

An analogy: you're a postman. You have a sack of mail to deliver to a single street. The mail is all jumbled up in a random order. Your strategy is to pick a piece of mail from your sack, deliver it, and repeat until your sack is empty.
A colleague of yours comes up with the idea of sorting the mail by house number before starting to deliver it. He finds that he can get his work done a lot more quickly than you, because he doesn't need to visit the same house more than once, and doesn't need to keep walking up and down the street.
Has your colleague found a shortcut, or is it a real efficiency gain? Are you doing more "work" than him? Should he be paid less than you because he is able to achieve his goal more easily than you can? You can call it "a shortcut" if you like, and he will call it "an efficiency gain", and you're both right. But it doesn't matter what you call it. Ultimately he's able to undercut you, because he is better at his job than you are.
ASICBOOST is effectively avoiding walking up the same driveway multiple times.
Pre-sorting mail before delivering it is an obvious efficiency gain. Every postal service does it. The problem arises when one postal service patents "sorting" as a concept and won't allow their competition to use it, because then the people who own the patent, and any people who don't care about breaking patent law have an advantage over everyone else.
SegWit flattens the playing field by building a mail shuffling machine into every mailman's sack, so pre-sorting no longer works. Then it no longer matters who has a patent on sorting, because sorting no longer gives anyone an advantage.

In summary:

I believe the idea of the UASF is that all the economically important nodes need to run it. If they don't, it fails. For the purposes of this discussion let's assume that all the exchanges run a UASF node.


Right. And 100% is enough to lock in the activation of SegWit on that chain, since 100 &gt;= 95.


As the code currently stands they won't. After seeing a full 2016-block period of SegWit blocks, SegWit will enter the LOCKED_IN state. It then takes 2016 more blocks before SegWit is actually activated, but during those 2016 blocks BIP148 nodes will still be rejecting blocks which don't signal for SegWit, which they don't need to. By now the "BIP148" chain could be longer than the other chain, and so it's quite possible there are some miners mining on it which could be helping this "LOCKED_IN" phase pass more quickly. But with the code the way it currently is, they won't be.

This is a bad idea. Rolling 3D6 gives you 10 and 11 more than other numbers. It almost never gives you 3, and never gives you 1 or 2. Your private key will be much more predictable than a truly random one.
2D8 is better, but not much. Your private key won't have any 0 digits in it, since 2D8 gives between 2 and 16, or only 15 different results. It also gives 9 more often than the other numbers.
In general you don't want to be adding dice rolls together. Just roll 100D6, write the rolls end to end and sha256 the resulting string.
bitaddress has a section at the end of its 'wallet details' tab: "How do I make a wallet using dice? What is B6?":

Bandwidth is an issue for me, and I'm not on dial-up. It becomes an issue for everyone if you double the block size enough times.

It works because Mycelium uses a server owned by the Mycelium project to check the balance on your address. That server already has a full copy of the blockchain.
If you followed my steps, you'll now have the same address and private key on two different wallets. I'm not sure what happens if you spend some of it on Mycelium - maybe the change goes to a new address. (Edit: after doing a little looking around it appears that importing a single private key makes you an account which reuses that one address over and over. Here's [**an example**]( of a transaction from a single address Mycelium account. The change goes back to the same address; this is bad for privacy, and kind of dangerous if quantum computing has been invented).
If all you wanted to do was check the balance at that address, you can do it using Mycelium. If you want to spend the coins I would recommend making a new HD account (an HD wallet will give you a new address each time you receive or spend coins, so you don't use the same address twice; all the addresses are generated from a single 12 word seed) in Mycelium, writing down the 12 word seed, and then sending your coins to the new account. That way you keep control of your coins so long as you keep a record of the 12 word seed.

Somebody hid 256 pots of gold of increasing value and difficulty to find. The first pot is worth 1 mBTC, the 256th is worth 256 mBTC.
You can [see here]( how many have been found so far. Each pot is roughly twice as hard to find as the previous one, since the n'th pot's private key only has n bits in it.
* To find the 1st pot we only had to check 1 location.
* To find the 2nd pot we had to check 2 locations.
* To find the 3rd pot we had to check 4 locations.
* To find the 4th pot we had to check 8 locations.
* To find the 11th pot we had to check 1024 locations.
* To find the 21st pot we had to check around 1 million locations.
* To find the 31st pot we had to check around 1 billion locations.
* To find the 41st pot we had to check around 1 trillion locations.
* And so on.

That depends what you're asking:
Is it true that when you spend from an address you reveal the public key of that address? Yes. Even if you use Mycelium.
Is it true that Mycelium sends from a different address every time? No. It depends what unspent outputs you have in your wallet. There is no way to ask Mycelium to generate multiple receiving addresses. It won't give you a new address until the previous one is funded. So you end up giving the same receiving address to multiple clients if you want to invoice multiple people at once. Then you end up with multiple unspent outputs at the same address, and when you spend from the first of them the others have their security compromised slightly. This is a known issue, but it isn't a priority to fix it, apparently.

Hashing is different than encrypting.

Bitcoin Core checks each block as it comes it to see if it affects any of the addresses that it is interested in. If you import a new private key into Core, it will need to rescan the whole blockchain to see if any of the old blocks paid to that key's address.
If you're asking about wallets like Mycelium and Electrum, they connect to special servers which have already built indices that let them quickly find the utxos for any given address.
If you're asking about SPV wallets, that's a good question. I don't know how they do it. They connect to random Bitcoin Core nodes, and somehow are able to figure out the balance for any address. [This stackexchange answer]( talks about how it happens - it seems to involve a lot of work on the server's end.

The neat thing about CLAM is that a lot of people already own some and don't know it.
The initial distribution method was to give 4.6 CLAMs to every Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Doge address that held a non-dust balance on 12th May 2014. To claim it you need to still have access to the private key that controlled the balance, but it doesn't matter if the address still holds a balance. The private key for the 4.6 CLAMs is the same as for the BTC/LTC/DOGE address which held the balance. The CLAM address will be different than the BTC address, since the version byte is different (CLAM addresses start with an 'x') but the private key is the same. Just-Dice offers a `/dig` command that will check a BTC address you give it and tell you whether it holds free CLAMs. If you trust it with your privkey, it will also "dig up" your free CLAMs for you. I'd recommend emptying the BTC address first so you don't have to trust the site not to steal your BTC. Not that it would of course, but it's better not to even leave room for doubt.

That's only true if hardened derivation isn't used for the individual addresses.

What do you mean by USD "flowing into BTC"? BTC is a different currency than USD. You can't put USD into BTC any more than you can put gold into pork bellies.
Every time someone buys BTC for USD someone else is selling BTC for USD in the same trade. When I sell you 1 BTC for $11k did $11k move into BTC or out of BTC? It moved out of your hands and into my hands, and the BTC moved from me to you. But the USD didn't go into the BTC.

Promoting a Ponzi scheme makes him guilty of promoting a Ponzi scheme, yes.

I'm blaming him, but not because he's black. His race has nothing to do with it.


What about him? I wasn't at that conference. Are you suggesting that if I don't hunt down every last Ponzi promoter then I shouldn't be allowed to comment at all?


I attempt to warn people about the risks of Ponzis wherever I see them promoted. That doesn't mean I have to spent all my time hunting down people to comment on. I'm sure there are many more Ponzis than I even know about. I do what I can. What are you doing, defending a known serial Ponzi promoter? Is it because he's black?

He's different than me. He actively promotes scams so that he can get rich by taking a cut of his victims' losses. I try to warn those victims. That seems like a difference to me.


He actively promoted it, knowing it was a scam.


You're the one bringing race into this, not me. I have posted warnings against many different Ponzi schemes and Ponzi promoters. In most cases I don't know what race the scammer is. In all cases I don't care. This is about scamming, not about race.

There are two components. One is a secure unit which holds the secrets. The other is insecure and holds the code that runs. The secure unit wants to make sure that the insecure unit hasn't been tampered with, but it has no access to the insecure unit's storage.
So what it does is asks the insecure unit "what code are you running?". The insecure unit sends the secure unit a bunch of code, and if it looks good, the secure unit trusts it. But the insecure unit is insecure. If it has been tampered with it can lie about what code it is running, showing the good official code to the secure unit while actually running hacked code.

Bitcoin is different than most investment classes because it works more like a bearer bond. When you hold Bitcoin you really hold it rather than just holding a piece of paper like when you buy into a gold ETF or buy stocks and shares. With Bitcoin you're not having to trust a third party. For most investments you do have to. Either that or you take physical possession of an expensive item or some land, which can be expensive to protect and hard to move around securely.

No. Different pools have different coinbases so two pools will never search the same space. And it would make no sense for a pool to give the same work to two different miners.
There's no duplication of work, and so no advantage to be gained by knowing that some mining equipment doesn't search particular nonce ranges.
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:17:05


Really? I read it as a question about whether miners were trying to find prime numbers. Miners aren't trying to find prime numbers, by the way, they're trying to find blocks which have headers which hash to a low number.
The block header they hash contains the Merkle root (ie. hash) of all the transactions in the block. The first transaction in the block is a special transaction which creates some coins and pays it to the miner's address. This address will be different for each mining pool. So that is enough to prevent different pools from duplicating each others' work. Within each pool the pool is responsible for sharing the work out to its miners. It would be wasteful to give the same work to more than one miner, so they don't.

Well, it took me a while, but I figured out what's wrong.
 is generating the redeem script incorrectly. The locktime is a 4 byte value in the 2nd through 5th bytes of the redeem script. In your case it's 57c969c0
Converting to decimal we see it's the correct value:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; int('57c969c0', 16)
    1472817600
But Bitcoin does everything backwards. You have to reverse the byte order to c069c957. Your script is being interpretted as a locktime of:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; int('-4069c957', 16)
    -1080674647
and a negative locktime is 'non-standard', so it isn't propagated.
You could possibly get the transaction mined by submitting it directly to some mining pools.
Try copy/pasting your redeem script into  to see how the locktime is interpretted.

Not necessarily. It depends on how many unspent outputs (utxos) make up your balance.
If you are buying something for $12 and you have four $5's in your wallet, you'll give the cashier 3 of them and get $3 back in change. The other $5 will stay in your wallet. But if you only have a single $20 in your wallet you'll give it to the cashier and get back a new $8 in change.
It's the same with your Bitcoin wallet. If four people each pay you $5, you'll have four $5 utxos in your wallet. They don't merge into a single $20. Whereas if someone pays you $20 all at once, that stays as a singe $20 in your wallet.
When you make a payment, your wallet is responsible for checking what utxos you have, and figuring out how best to make up the amount you're trying to spend based on what it has available to it.

No, it doesn't give you the expected time between blocks. It gives you the average time between blocks which is likely different.
Analogy: Flip a fair coin 100 times, count the number of heads. Divide number of heads by 100. That gives you the average number of heads per flip. It might be 0.47 or 0.51. But the expected number of heads per flip is 0.5.

I don't see how that follows at all. Even if all but a thousand Bitcoins were lost forever that wouldn't set a floor on the price. The remaining ones would be more rare than they were before, but that in itself isn't enough to mean the price per unit could never drop below $100.

There's a 1% house edge on every bet. If you keep betting your whole balance over and over, your *expected* loss is 1% of your whole balance every time you bet it.
Since you expect to lose 1% of everything you bet, the optimal strategy is to expect to bet as little as possible.
It's kind of counter intuitive, but if you have 1 BTC and want to double it, the best strategy isn't to make a single bet of 1 BTC with a 49.5% chance of doubling it. You can do a little better by running a Martingale sequence of bets and end up with a slightly higher chance of doubling your money.

When we take about "fee per byte" these days, we're really talking about "fee per byte of virtual size". Remember SegWit gives a 75% discount on witness data. The virtual size of a transaction is defined as the size of the non-witness part of the transaction plus a quarter of the size of the witness part. Or alternaively, as a quarter of the transaction's weight, where the weight is defined as four times the size of the non-witness part plus the size of the witness part.
OP's transaction has a weight of 1042, and so a virtual size of a quarter of that, or 260.5. Its actual size is 424 bytes. So it has 206 bytes of non-witness data, and 218 bytes of witness data.
`non_witness_size = 206`
`witness_size = 218`
`size = non_witness_size + witness_size = 206 + 218 = 424`
`weight = 4*non_witness_size + witness_size = 4*206 + 218 = 1042`
`vsize = weight / 4 = 1042 / 4 = 260.5`
blockchain.info (incorrectly) calculates the feerate as `fee / size` = `282 / 424` = `0.665 sat/B`
The actual feerate is `fee / vsize` = `282 / 260.5` = `1.0825 sat/B`

To steal funds from an address, first you need to figure out a public key of the address (ie. find a public key which hashes to give that address - it's hard to do this) and then you need to find the private key corresponding to that public key - it's hard to do this too.
When you spend from an address, you publish the public key corresponding to that address, so you have given away the first part of the puzzle. The attacker would still need to find the private key, but that part is apparently easier to do if you have access to a quantum computer. The first part (finding a public key from an address) isn't.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:05:12
Presumably you tell it your BTC address, give it some USD, and it sends a corresponding amount of BTC to the address you gave it.

Right, so you're not protected. If you leak any private key (say the one for the address at `m/44'/0'/0'/0/23` along with your master public key, then I believe you will effectively be leaking all private keys at the same level because of the lack of a `'` on the last two levels.

Yes. Although the difference between (100 outputs and 1 change) vs. (100 outputs and no change) isn't very significant.
But you're right. They've likely got a good selection of utxos to choose from so they can find a subset that sums to very slightly less than the sum of the outputs plus tx fee.

True, but they will also reject a 1 satoshi fee transaction.


Maybe you meant  to say 1 satoshi per virtual byte, rather than 1 satoshi fee total". Because paying a total fee of 1 satoshi will be considered to be paying 0 by almost all nodes.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:50:40


Blocks are limited to a weight of 4 million. Each byte in the base block counts as a weight of 4, and each byte in the witness area counts as a weight of 1.
Your (1+3) block would have a weight of 1*4 + 3*1 = 7 million, and so would be rejected.
The theoretical 4 Mb biggest block corresponds to 0 Mb in the base and 4 Mb in the witness area. ie. if it was all signatures and nothing else. Clearly that's not possible, but puts a maximum on the achievable blocksize.
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:07:48
No. In the batching scenario only one transaction took place. It was a big transaction, with 101 outputs, but it was only 1 transaction. And that's the point. Batching reduces the number of transactions, and so possibly reduces the number of transactions per second.

Most block explorers have their own massive database which takes hours to build, and needs updating with every block that is mined. This one doesn't.
The downside of that is that this explorer can't look up the balance of an address, or tell you where (or even whether) the outputs of a transaction were spent, since the underlying Bitcoin Core client doesn't have that information indexed.

They are proposing forbidding RBF for their customers. That's unacceptable. If the miners are willing to mine my low-fee transactions in a timely manner (as they almost always seem willing to do recently) what business is it of BitPay's to insist that I pay more than is necessary, and also find myself unable to get the transaction to confirm if the mempool suddenly gets filled up?
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:22:12
I think that one transaction [whatever it does] should be counted as one transaction when we're talking about how many transactions there are. If you want to count inputs or outputs then the numbers of inputs and outputs should count towards those counts.
We're pretty much arguing about what counting means here, and so I tend to agree than it's not worth doing.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:21:08
I can make a "rule" like "I am not willing to sell my BTC for less than $10k each". That's all the miners are doing, refusing to mine transactions that pay them less than a certain price.

Those are something ~~blockchain~~ *blockchair* made up. Presumably 's' for 'source' and 'd' for 'destination', then some hash involving the txid and input/output number.
The inputs of these small transactions all just have `0x51` as their input script (which is spending a previous utxo which has an empty output script) and `0x6a` as their output script (which is a blank `OP_RETURN`). . Each transaction takes 62 bytes, which is likely close to the smallest a tx can legally be.

The lookup table says "roll again, need 1 or 2" for the T342 ticket. That results in the words "zone" and "zoo" being 3 times more likely to appear in the seed phrase than any other word.
The correct instruction would be to replace the ticket in the bag and draw again rather than just re-rolling the die.
Also, [Ian Coleman]( has a script which can do a similar thing but without the need for paper tickets. Just roll a die a bunch of times, or shuffle a deck of cards and it will generate you a seed phrase using the entropy you enter.

Each Bitcoin address has a private key. That private key is just a number. Anyone guessing the number can spend the coins at that address.
The way we keep our coins safe is by using huge random numbers for our private keys.
What this guy has done is used some very low number for his private keys. The first output, with a value of 0.001 BTC, used the private key of 1. This isn't a very hard number to guess.
If you go to  then click on the 'wallet details' tab and put 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 into the 'private key' field at the top and hit return, it will show you the addresses that correspond to private key 1 (you need to put in 64 hexadecimal digits so it recognizes it as a private key). You will see it corresponds to [1BgGZ9tcN4rm9KBzDn7KprQz87SZ26SAMH]( - the recipient of the 0.0001 BTC.
So you just need a program which does the same thing for each private key in turn. Vanitygen is a program that does something pretty similar, only instead of testing each private key in turn it tests random private keys. You could modify the vanitygen code to do this testing for you.

You would need to define "legitimate". From a technical standpoint transactions are allowed to do all of those things and still be "legitimate".
Whether a transaction is "spam" or not likely depends on the intention of its creator, and so there's no way to be sure which are "spam" and which are not.
All we can say is that there is less demand for block space now than there was a few months ago. Whether that's because people stopped "spamming", people started using the blockchain more efficiently, or people stopped using Bitcoin altogether because it was too expensive is hard to say with any certainty.

bech32 produces smaller transactions than P2SH segwit transactions.
Edit: it takes:
* one extra byte per output to create P2SH outputs than to create bech32 utxos (P2SH uses `OP_HASH160` and `OP_EQUAL` in addition to a 20 byte hash in its script, whereas bech32 just uses a fixed `00` byte in addition to a 20 byte hash), and
* 23 extra bytes per input to spend from P2SH utxos than from bech32 utxos (P2SH has to produce the script that was hashed when spending in the sigscript, which takes 23 bytes to encode - bech32 has no non-witness sigscript at all).

The problem with saying "the fees are $20" is that it really depends on the size of the transaction. If you have sold a thousand T-shirts, taken a thousand separate BTC payments, and are trying to move those payments all at once to an exchange, it's going to cost you a lot more than if you're only spending a single utxo.
Another problem with it is that the fees depend an awful lot on what wallet you're using and just how badly it was programmed. Some wallets today are suggesting fees of 100 sat/B when 2 sat/B is enough for most use cases, and so people are paying 50 times more than they need to and don't even know it.

You asked how to run two nodes on the same IP address, so I told you how.
I'm sure there are lots of different reasons for running a node, but I don't see how that's relevant here. My ISP doesn't allow me to receive incoming connections at all, so personally it makes no different whether I use `-listen=0` or not. All my connections are outgoing either way.
I run a node so that I can validate the transactions people send me. It's the only way to be sure the coins I receive are real. If you're not running a node you're trusting some third party to run a node for you. And that goes against the original point of Bitcoin: individual financial sovereignty.

Yes, I remember that. The 12-word-seed-phrase thing didn't happen until much later when they finally implemented deterministic addresses.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:02:23
Note also that even those running a "pruned" node which only holds on to the most recent blocks still has a copy of the links, since they are encoded in some unspent outputs. Every full node, pruned or not, has to keep a copy of all unspent outputs around in order to validate incoming transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:01:47
This kind of misses the point though - you don't have to guess an address' private key to spend its balance. All you need is to guess and of the ~2^96 private keys which hash to the same 160 bit address. So the bottom red line should really be up at the 160 bit level, and the "any with a balance" should be at the 134 bit level. Still a lot harder than winning the powerball, but not as hard as this image might lead you to believe.
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:43:30
Increasing the blocksize limit (willy nilly or not) will fork the chain unless there's consensus to do it. And there isn't.
It's fine to discuss it. It's even fine to do it I guess - it has been done several times already and given me a lot of free altcoins to dump for extra Bitcoins. I guess one more forkcoin can't hurt.

He started with about 1800 BTC and made 27 big bets in a row. 26 of them won and the 27th lost. They all had over 95% chance of winning I think but he was bound to lose one eventually.
Here's a chart of his profit against the number of bets he made. The x axis goes up to 750 or so because he made hundreds of 0 BTC bets between his big bets, presumably looking for a pattern in the outcomes or something.

This isn't really a vulnerability unless time travel exists. SegWit utxos are "anyone can spend" before the SegWit soft fork happens, which isn't a problem unless we can go back in time. And even then, come to think of it most SegWit outputs are created by timelocked transactions, so even going back in time won't let us steal them.
Foiled again! :)
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:23:53


Why not? I can check that I have the correct private keys, and I can also check that the UTXOs I think I control actually exist. What else do I need to know to be sure I control those coins? I guess I have no way to be sure that I have *exclusive* knowledge of those private keys, but it's likely I do else the UTXOs would probably have been spent already.
@_date: 2018-02-26 06:04:30
I edited it again to provide more details. I found those numbers by counting the sizes of the various parts of different transactions.
Whenever I spend from a bech32 address the transaction is smaller than an equivalent transaction which spends from a P2SH segwit address. By 22 to 24 bytes per input. When I pay from bech32 to P2SH the transaction is 192 or 193 bytes. When I pay from P2SH to P2SH it is 215 or 216 bytes. 1 input, 1 output in all cases. The transaction size depends on the length of the signature, which can vary by 1 byte randomly.

Fair enough. I hadn't looked at the code, and didn't think very deeply about it. I was guessing that since base58 is a simple base conversion plus checksum and bech32 has good error detection properties, bech32 much necessarily be more complex. I was ignoring the fact that the base conversion requires bignums, and that the base58 checksum uses sha256 which is itself complex.

Because lots of people already know and trust Bitcoin, whereas 2Xcoin is pretty much unknown, has been rushed out, and has roughly zero developers working on it.
What makes you think people would want to use a coin which has no dev team supporting it?
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:46:24
The script that you need to satisfy says pretty much "provide me a public key which has this 20-byte hash, and a signature made with that public key and I'll let you spend this output".
So any private key which corresponds to any public key which hashes to that 20 byte value will work. The blockchain doesn't know which private key was used. All that is recorded is the 20 byte hash of the public key.
It's incredibly hard to even find a public key which hashes to a given 20 byte value let alone find a private key that would give that public key, because 2^160 is a huge search space.

OK, but the same goes for orders as for individuals.
A single 1000 BTC buy order can be matched with 1000 separate 1 BTC sell orders. Orders can be partially matched.

In order to spend a SegWit output of that form, you have to provide the script which hashes to that hash, and some inputs for that script which make it run properly (ie. usually a signature or two, etc.).
For legacy nodes, all you have to provide is the script which hashes to that hash. The legacy nodes won't care about making the script run correctly. So as an attacker all you need to do is wait for the rightful owner to try spending his output, which means he has to publish the script. At that point you can copy the script and use it to make a transaction which legacy nodes will see as valid.
So you can't steal his SegWit output until you know the script, but the owner has to publish the script to spend his output. And if he reuses his SegWit address, you can also steal any other outputs at the same address as soon as he tries to spend any one of them.
All this only works if the miners aren't enforcing the SegWit rules, which they are. So all this is moot anyway. :)
Edit: I might be wrong about all that. Maybe you only have to provide a pubkey which hashes to that hash, not a script. I'm no SegWit expert. Either way, the real owner gives you all the info you need to steal his money if nobody's enforcing the SegWit rules, but they are, so you can't.

It's strange that you take a fraction of a cent as your base unit, but end up with a conclusion that we don't have enough bitcoins because fractions of a satoshi don't exist. Fractions of a cent don't exist either...




That's not how percentages work. It's 0.2%. You have two too many zeroes.
Either way it's possible to increase the divisibility of Bitcoin to more than 8 decimal places with a fork, if needed in the future. Currently each satoshi is worth a little over a hundredth of a US cent, so we have a lot of room for growth before that is necessary.

When you craft a raw transaction, you list the inputs and the outputs, and there's no sanity check as to what the fee will be.
So if your inputs sum to 10 BTC and your outputs sum to 1 BTC you've just tipped the miner 9 BTC. There's no confirmation to make sure you wanted to give 9 BTC to the miner, it just happens.
The relatively new 'fundrawtransaction' RPC makes this a little safer, since it takes care of the change for you, but that likely won't work with SegWit change addresses so we're back where we started.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:23:43
Nodes don't reject it - they simply refuse to relay it to their peers.
What if I sent a low-fee transaction directly to you, as a raw transaction. You submit it to your node. Your node accepts it, and you think I've paid you. You don't notice that your node is unable to get any of its peers to accept it.
You would consider it to be an unconfirmed transaction even though the rest of the world doesn't know about it.

No, I don't see why.
The miners will naturally pick the highest fee transactions to put into their blocks. It doesn't matter how many miners there are - they'll all act in much the same way.
If there's a full block worth of transactions offering to pay 100 sat/B then your 90 sat/B transaction won't get in to that block. Maybe by the time the next block is found your 90 sat/B will be in the top 1 MB of transactions, and maybe it won't.

Then let me explain it.
When Bitcoin Cash forked off, your BTC private keys worked to spend your BCH coins, but the BCH developer was careful to slightly change the way that signatures are created in BCH, so that BTC clients won't accept BCH transactions, and BCH clients won't accept BTC transactions.
The S2X developers, on the other hand, have deliberately not changed anything about how transactions are created for S2X. So any transaction which spends pre-fork BTC will be valid on both chains. You may be attempting to spend your BTC and not even have heard of S2X, but some smartass somewhere will see your transaction on the BTC network and copy it exactly onto the S2X network where it will be used to send your S2X coins to the same address as you spent them to on the BTC network. The attack works in both directions: S2X transactions can be copied onto the BTC network by any third party, so you may think you're just sending your S2X coins to your S2X deposit address at an exchange to dump them, but accidentally end up having moved your BTC to the same address, which isn't even an address in the exchange's BTC wallet. You'll end up having to contact the exchange's support department, and they may refuse to return your BTC.
There are various ways of making a transaction which is valid on one chain and not the other, to avoid these replay attacks. [I wrote about them here](

You could even mine to your current P2SH segwit address if you like. Just don't mine to your current bech32 segwit address, because back then anyone could spend those coins.
Edit: in fact if you have a time machine you don't need to bother mining. You can go back in time to before the SegWit hard fork and steal a bunch of coins that are currently in SegWit addresses. All you would need is the script for the p2sh SegWit address, and a bunch of those have already been published.

Run the client, wait for it to appear to hang, then check the end of the log file. Wait a minute, check it again. Is the log file growing? Does it keep growing? If so, it isn't really hung, but is "rolling forward" all the blocks. That number at the end of each line is the block number.

It's about 1 in 4 billion. The checksum is 32 bits.
A much bigger risk is that you have some malware which changes the address between the 'copy' and 'paste' so you end up sending the coins to an address controlled by the malware.
I guess even smarter malware would change it right after you click 'send' in your wallet software, after you've visually checked it.

It depends how much slippage you are willing to accept, and whether you care about the difference in maker and taker fees.

Slushpool's block was 6 minutes after the previous block. Those 6 minutes gave time for a bunch of higher-fee transactions to build up in the mempool.
See how the earliest block in the list (at the bottom of the screenshot) has the highest fees. Presumably there was a relatively long time between it and the block before it.
When two blocks are found in quick succession, the first one takes the highest fee transactions and the second one is left to take whatever remains. Since the mempool is pretty much empty these days that's likely to only be the low fee transactions.

Doh, I didn't see this comment before writing my reply to you.
Here's an interesting observation, which you may well still disagree with:
Pick a random point in time. What is the expected time between the two blocks surrounding that point in time?
You seem to agree that the expected time to the next block is 10 minutes. By symmetry, the expected time to the previous block is also 10 minutes. And so the expected time between the two blocks is 20 minutes!
Even though the average time between blocks is 10 minutes.
Can that be true?

Lightning relies on unconfirmed transactions being passed between parties. If one party tries to cheat the other party can broadcast a transaction, get it onto the blockchain, and take all the money. That should be enough to keep both parties honest.

Isn't the point of schnorr signatures to reduce the amount of signature data? If so, that would reduce the blocksize not increase it. SegWit's weight calculation gives a discount for signature data, so it allows for bigger blocks precisely when a bigger percentage of transactions are signature data.
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:15:19


No. Assuming constant hash rate the average time between blocks is 10 minutes, not 5. The hash rate tends to increase over time so the difficulty lags behind making the average time between blocks closer to 9 minutes than 10.


No. You are more likely to wait 0 min than 10 min.


What about the times when you wait 60 minutes? Why are you only averaging two times?


Your math is completely wrong and gives you the wrong result. I would argue it isn't good enough at all.
I think your fundamental mistake here is that you're assuming that the blocks are found regularly. If the blocks came every 10 minutes like clockwork then you would on average wait 5 minutes for the next one. But they don't, and so you wait an average of 10 minutes for the next one (actually 9, due to difficulty lag).

The first is empty, and is required due to a bug in how multisig works.  
The 2nd and 3rd are two signatures.  
The 4th is the script which the other three satisfy.
Let's break down the script. It has 6 things in it:
    52
    210238165ce28c0bedc3645f75197c3e446df6047451ca3712a795b10426bf7ee090

    53
    ae
The last line, `ae` is the [opcode for `CHECKMULTISIG`] (  
The last but one line says we have 3 pubkeys. (`53` is the opcode for OP_3, which puts a 3 on the stack)  
The 3 lines before that are the 3 pubkeys.  
The first line says we need 2 signatures.  (`52` is the opcode for OP_2, which puts a 2 on the stack)
So it's a 2 of 3 multisig.
~~Why `52` and `53` instead of `02` and `03`? I don't know. Can someone explain that please?~~
Edit: to answer my own question, `52` is the opcode for `OP_2`, which puts a 2 on the stack. See [the source code](
Edit2: tl;dr if the witness starts `04` and ends `53ae` then it's very likely a 2 of 3 multisig; indeed if it starts `0x` and ends `5yae` for any `x` and `y` it is likely an (x-2) of y multisig.

We get an average of 6 blocks per ~~minute~~ *hour*. We need to decide whether we're going to accept these 32 tx blocks from BitMain or not. If we do, we reduce the throughput of the network as a whole. Rejecting them will lead to a lower difficulty, and more profit for the honest miners.
Once BitMain figure out that the rest of the network isn't going to accept their nonsense any more, maybe they will stop messing around and do their job.
Edit: I just checked a random recent ~1MB block. The reward was 12.68 BTC, of which 12.5 BTC was the regular block reward. The 0.18 BTC reward from tx fees is pretty small in comparison to the 12.5 BTC. I don't think it would take long for them to feel the pressure if other miners stopped accepting their 32-tx blocks.

Call it 1.17647 mBTC or 1,176.47 bits if you don't like leading zeroes.


You don't have to use BTC. You can use mBTC or uBTC (bits).


You do away with the "millibits" but add in the new confusion of kilosatoshis, megasatoshis, and gigasatoshis. How is that any better?


That's just a labelling issue. You're free to use whatever terms you like.


That's not an overhaul. It's just a change to how the units are displayed.


The Bitcoin Core software already allows you to chose whether to display values in BTC, mBTC, or uBTC (bits). There's no "kilosatoshi" option because frankly that doesn't make much sense.


You seem to be rediscovering the SI system. We already have it and use it today. But rather than basing it off the 10^-8 satoshi, it makes more sense to base it on the BTC figure that we're already using. There there are 10^3 mBTC in a BTC and 10^6 uBTC in a BTC.
Having 10^5 kS in a BTC seems somewhat arbitrary, especially when we may need to hard fork to have more divisibility in the future. The size of the satoshi is pretty much arbitrary after all.

That's not how it works. There's nothing saying which inputs the fee is coming from. There's not even anything in a transaction that says how much the fee is. All there is is a list of inputs, and a list of outputs.
The fee is implicitly specified as the sum of the inputs minus the sum of the outputs. So if I use four 5 BTC utxos as inputs, 12 BTC as a payment output, and 7.5 BTC as a change output, the fee is 4*5 - 12 - 7.5 = 0.5 BTC, but there's no way of saying which of the 4 inputs "paid the fee" - they all did, together.

I'm not trolling you.
Trains aren't Poisson distributed. They are approximately regular. Some trains are early, some are late, but they are intended to run once per hour or whatever. Blocks aren't like that. Thinking that you can compare blocks to trains isn't a valid simplification. It leads to very wrong results.
If you turn up at the train station at a random time, and the trains are meant to run once per hour, your expected waiting time is indeed 30 minutes.
But your expected waiting time to the next block (assuming an average of 6 blocks per hour) is 10 minutes.
This is true. I'm not trolling you. And you claim to have an academic background, so take a few minutes to think about this, and see if you can figure out why it is true. If you can't, then try simulating it. Pick a few million random points in time from the last 8 years, and check how long after each random point in time it took for the next block to be found. Average those times. Notice that the average time is around 9 minutes. Now what is trolling you?

Yes, in theory. You can try mining Bitcoin on your home computer, but the chances of you actually finding a block are incredibly close to zero. And if you do find a block, you get 12.5 BTC, not just one of them.
People join mining pools, and work together on finding blocks. Then when anyone in the pool finds a block everyone who worked towards it gets a share of the rewards.
It's still not worth doing unless you have specialized equipment. The CPU in your home computer really isn't very efficient at mining compared to dedicated chips which were designed to do nothing other than mine Bitcoins.

For that 7 cents to be more than 0.2% of the transaction amount, the amount I was exchanging would need to be less than $35.

The answer to your question is "it depends".
It depends whether hardened derivation is being used or not.

The two forks will have the same difficulty, but nobody wants 2X coins. People will dump their 2X coins for real Bitcoins, driving the 2X price down and the BTC price up.

Exactly. Your best bet is to hold the coins in your own local wallet where you control your own private keys. If you're holding the coins primarily as an investment, that's what you should be doing anyway.


For each BTC in your wallet, you would suddenly have a new 2X coin in your wallet. Your hardware wallet might not recognize that they were there until you upgrade its software, but you'd have them anyway. The same private keys that are currently used to control access to your BTC will also work in the future to control access to your 2Xcoins. That's why if you hold your BTC in an exchange, the exchange gets to decide whether to keep your 2Xcoins or give them to you, since they are the ones holding the private keys in that situation - all you hold is an IOU from the exchange that you hope means they will one day let you withdraw your BTC.

Even if the hashrate drops to 10%, there will still be a block on average every 100 minutes. You'll be able to get into it if you're willing to pay a high enough fee. And if the fees get high enough, miners will want to mine the real Bitcoin chain to claim those high fees.

Suppose you run a nightclub. You can fit 1000 people inside. There's a massive crowd outside. Some of them are willing to pay $100 to get in, but some are only willing to pay $1. There's a whole range of amounts the peple are willing to pay. You want to maximize the amount of money you make.
The obvious strategy is to allow in the 1000 people who are willing to pay the most to get in.
A different owner might decide to let in only the people who want to pay $1 or less, but they'd end up making less money.


That's just like saying "what if there was a way to only let in the people who wanted to pay less than a dollar to get into my club". There is. But it makes no economic sense to do so.


There's a limited amount of space in the club. The "miners" are rationally deciding to sell that space to the people willing to pay the most for it. Why would they do anything differently?

Blocks were faster for a while because of BCH's difficulty hack. The BCH emergency difficulty adjustment dropped the BCH difficulty massively, making half the Bitcoin hashrate switch to BCH for a few days, which caused the BTC difficulty to drop, and so when the miners came back from BCH to BTC they were mining with full force, but lower difficulty. That's what gave us the faster blocks for a while, and helped clear the mempool.
Not directly anything to do with SegWit, but the BCH launch was presumably a reaction to SegWit activating - a Big Blocker temper tantrum.

Suppose I have 101 BTC in a single piece, and I want to send it to 100 different people.
Without batching, I would make the first transaction spending the 100, send 1 to the 1st person, and 99 back to myself as change. The 2nd transaction would spend the 99, sending 1 to the 2nd person, and 98 back to myself as change. And so on.
100 transactions, each with 1 input and 2 outputs. So a total of 100 inputs and 200 outputs.
On the other hand, if I make a single transaction paying everyone at once, I have 1 input and 101 outputs (1 per person, and 1 change output for myself).
In this case, batching saved 99 inputs and 99 outputs (basically the 99 extra change amounts which were both created and spent).
Each input is about 147 bytes, and each (P2PHK) output is 34 bytes, so that's a saving of (147+34)*99 = 17,919 bytes when you batch 100 payments into a single transaction.
The inputs and outputs of the single transaction take 147+101*34 = 3,581 bytes, whereas those of the 100 separate transactions take 100*147+200*34 = 21,500 bytes, or 6 times more, and that's without taking the (small) per-transaction overhead into account.

A couple of things:
1. private keys are 256 bits not 512
2. for regular 'starts-with-a-1' addresses, the address is generated from a 160 bit hash of the 256 bit public key. In order to spend your coins I don't need to guess your private key, I only need to guess a private key which has the same address. There are "only" 2^160 different 1xxxx addresses.
2^160 is still a massive number though.

Hackers could change the address between you pasting the address and you clicking to send it to the hardware wallet. Some wallets have a display to confirm which address they're signing, and some don't.
You still have to trust that the firmware on the hardware wallet is bug free. Which it probably isn't.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:44:01
What's wrong with it is that it reduces the transaction throughput. Each empty block we accept while the mempool is large is 1 MB of transactions we could have confirmed but didn't.
We pay miners to confirm transactions and to secure the chain. Empty blocks are only securing the chain, yet earn almost as much for the miner as if they were doing both jobs.

Yes. If you generate enough transactions paying 1000 satoshis per byte to fill every block, the miners will fill the blocks with your transactions and ignore transactions from others paying a lower fee per byte.
1000 satoshis per byte times a million bytes works out to 10 BTC per block, 60 BTC per hour, 1440 BTC per day to keep the fees at 1000 satoshis per byte, assuming you're the only one making transactions with that high a fee.

If you used bitaddress.org to encrypt the private key, try using the same site to decrypt it. That rules out any incompatibility between copay/bread and bitaddress.

Sometimes it works the opposite way. At the time of the BCH fork, anyone who was holding BTC on Bittrex was instantly credited with the same number of BCH. Those of us who hold our own coins had to wait for some silly high number of confirmations to deposit and dump our BCH, but the people who left their coins on Bittrex could dump their BCH immediately, for up to 0.4 BTC per BCH.
By the time my deposit confirmed the price had dropped to around 0.1 BTC per BCH.

Does my lightning node ever need to look up the balance of a channel it isn't involved in? Why does it even care? All it will be able to see on the blockchain is the initial funding transaction. Any details of how those coins are currently distributed between the two parties is presumably private until the channel is closed.
It seems to me (and I know little about how lightning works) that my lightning node should only care about looking up its own channels on the blockchain, and since it will have been involved in the creation of those channels it shouldn't need any history, and so a pruned node should be sufficient.

Since segwit we measure transaction sizes in "virtual bytes". Yours is 260.5 virtual bytes, and so you paid a little over 1 satoshi per byte.
If you pay less than 1 satoshi per byte almost no nodes will relay your transaction due to the default policy. Your own node won't even let you pay less than 1 sat/B unless you change both of these settings:
    -mintxfee=&lt;amt&gt;
         Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for
         transaction creation (default: 0.00001)
    -minrelaytxfee=&lt;amt&gt;
         Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for relaying,
         mining and transaction creation (default: 0.00001)
Bitcoin Core will silently set the fee to 1 sat/B if you try to spend less than that without changing those two settings.

A slightly bigger percentage will think a 10% drop is impossible, and so on.
The bigger the percentage drop, the bigger the percentage of people who think a drop of that size is impossible.
I don't see how you could think it goes the opposite way. 1% drops are common, 99% drops are very rare. So more people think big drops are impossible than think small drops are impossible.

Pretty much. We've seen this before when Ethereum forked off from Ethereum Classic. There was no reply protection, and someone was running a bot which copied all transactions from both chains to the other chain.
I don't think it's a malicious actor trying to benefit from replaying particular transactions, but just someone wanting to watch the world burn in general.

Saying "n times faster" is talking about multiplying the speed by n.
How many times bigger is 60 than 10? It is 6 times bigger. "Times" is a word we use for multiplication, not addition. If we were talking about addition, then sure, 60 is 50 more than 10, and 50 is only 5 times 10.
I guess you can see it either way, but convention tells us that 30 is 3 times bigger than 10 (`30 = 10*3`), not 2 times bigger (`30 = 10 + 10*2`).

Bear in mind that in your example, each flip requires withdrawing USD from Kraken, converting it into RMB, and depositing that onto a Chinese exchange. You're not going to be able to do that more than once per day let alone 5 times per hour.

Note that the Bitcoin Core wallet doesn't maintain an index that allows it to find whether an address is funded or not.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; import binascii, hashlib
    &gt;&gt;&gt; s = hashlib.new('sha256')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; h = hashlib.new('ripemd160')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; s.update(binascii.unhexlify('04148f33be'))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; h.update(s.digest())
    &gt;&gt;&gt; h.hexdigest()

You're suggesting averaging over 1 month, and taking that as the expected value.

* for each transaction, get its size and vsize
* from that, calculate the size of the witness data for the transaction
* sort in order of size of witness data
* show the biggest 20
You get an output like this (each line shows txid, transaction size, transaction vsize (which is weight/4), base size, witness size):

I don't think being "dormant" matters. If I've been holding 1 BTC since 2010 I'm still holding it even if I don't ever move it between addresses.
And don't forget that it's possible to be holding 1 BTC spread over many different addresses. It doesn't all have to be at a single address.
And if we're looking at the odds of being struck by lightning during your lifetime, maybe we should look at the odds of people ever holding 1 BTC at any point in their lifetime, as opposed to holding it right now.
Finally, it doesn't look like the lightning strike odds are particularly agreed upon either.  says that:

If I want to make everyone pay at least 100 satoshis per byte to get into a block and there are no empty blocks being mined, it costs me 6 BTC per hour to keep the mempool full enough to do so (assuming 1 MB blocks, no SegWit).
If there are 3 empty blocks being mined per hour, it only costs me 3 BTC per hour to achieve the same goal (with the same assumptions).
3 BTC per hour is cheaper than 6 BTC per hour. That's what I mean.

Be careful with that if you intend to continue using the old client as well. When you spend from one of your clients, the change will go to a new address. The other client won't know the private key for that new change address, and so it won't be able to see the change.


There's one private key per address. Your funds are likely spread over multiple addresses, and so you need multiple private keys.


If the wallet you're attempting to recreate is a pre-HD Core wallet, there is no seed that will regenerate those old private keys.


You need the private key for all the funded addresses.


Your new wallet will see and be able to spend the funds in the addresses you provide the private keys for, and not for the other addresses.

When you mine a block, you're allowed to pay yourself for making it. The first transaction in the block is allowed to create 12.5 BTC, and also collect fees from all the other transactions in the block, and send up to that total to any address(es) you like. The transaction you linked to is the first transaction in block [484398]( That block collected 0.90702046 in fees, so the miner is allowed to pay himself 0.90702046 + 12.5 = 13.40702046 BTC - which is the exact amount you see being paid out in [the transaction you linked to](

I read through your guide and had a bunch of comments. I typed them up hoping you can use them to improve your guide. I sound critical in places I'm sure, but I mean well...


miners, not mines


That's a little confusing. The network isn't the same as the blockchain. The blockchain is the data structure that the network shares.


It's not so small. At 12.5 BTC + tx fees per block I'd say that's a large fee.


Kind of. There is a monetary policy, but it cannot be manipulated. It is enforced by the rules of the system which all the nodes agree to.


The money supply is inflating according to the monetary policy. Nobody can change the pre-set rate of inflation.


No, your wallet generates the keys. The private key should never leave your possession and certainly doesn't go onto the blockchain. The blockchain never "does" anything. It's a simple permanent immutable ledger of transactions.


Not until you first spend from that public key. Until then only a hash of the public key is on the blockchain. You provide the public key when you spend.


Do you mean "only the owner [...] knows [...]"? The owner knows both keys, so it's not correct to say he only knows the private key.


I'm not sure that's the best analogy, since the key to your house is something the public mostly don't have. You're comfortable with the public knowing your public key, but you're not comfortable with the public having a copy of your door key.
Maybe a better analogy: think of your *private* key as the key to your front door, and your *public* key as your street address. Anyone who knows your street address can come and look through your windows to see what stuff you have in there, and can drop gifts through the letter box, but only people with the door key have access to the stuff inside.


else your keys.
Or someone steals your keys without you knowing it. Or you store your stuff in someone else's house, and they are sloppy with custody of their door keys, or are themselves not trustworthy and steal your stuff. If you want to keep your stuff safe, keep it in your own house, and make sure nobody else can get access to your door key. In this analogy nobody knows how to break windows...




Relative to what?


I thought you said the supply was increasing, as new coins are regularly mined. Do you mean the rate at which new coins enter the supply is diminishing?


I'm not sure that's the right word. A is relative to B. A can't be just relative, without being relative to something. Can it?


Pick a capitalization and stick with it.


I don't know what you mean by that. How can a wallet (a piece of software you run on your computer) have an exchange (a company that facilitates trades between people)? I guess some wallets have decentralized exchanges built in - is that what you're getting at? That's probably enough of a corner case that mentioning it is more confusing than useful.


It's probably best to encourage people never to use third party wallets, especially since you already mentioned MtGox. Use an exchange to buy coins, then move them somewhere safe as soon as possible. Don't leave your stuff in someone else's house - keep it somewhere where you have the only key.


So did MtGox. Don't believe them.


That's a bad idea. Why would you store your investment funds somewhere that you don't control? Even thinking of it as "your exchange" shows strange thinking. It's not "yours", it's someone else's.


I've never heard of that. There are hard and soft forks, but wallets?
The important distinction is between wallets where you have sole control of your private keys and wallets where you don't. When you have sole control, you don't have to trust some stranger on the Internet not to run off with your money. That's the kind of wallet you want to be using. Because having strangers run off with your money is bad. It doesn't matter whether coinbase gets hacked, or pretends to get hacked, or just your account gets hacked, or the government shuts them down and takes all the coins - they all have the same outcome: you lose your money. The protection against this is to look after your own money by running your own wallet.
Once you have that part down, then you can worry about whether your wallet is online or offline, but the most important think to do first is to make sure that you are in control of your coins and not some Internet stranger.


How do I get greater utility by having a stranger hold my money for me? I hold my keys myself and have all the utility I need.


What is a "modified USB"? I think of USB as a way of connecting devices together, but don't know what it would mean to modify that.


I disagree. Cold storage means keeping your private keys away from an online machine, whereas with the Ledger you are plugging a device holding your private keys directly into an online machine. You have to hope that the firmware of the Ledger has no security holes in it so your private keys don't leak onto the online machine. I would never put my cold storage private keys onto a device I plan to plug into an online machine. Because that would stop them being "cold"...


Why not? Do you mean that because it takes a couple of seconds to find the Ledger and plug it in, that somehow makes the money not liquid? You can spend just as quickly from a Ledger as you can withdraw from Coinbase, and probably even more quickly. I've heard cases of Coinbase taking hours if not days to process a withdrawal request, whereas coins in your Ledger are always available, 24/7.


Pro: allows you to encrypt the private key with a passphrase of your choice, making it very hard for a thief to steal your coins.


Well, only if you put too much on a single address. Why not print 100 of them and put $1k on each, or whatever you feel comfortable with?


So make backups. Otherwise the same argument goes against every kind of wallet. If you lose a Trezor and don't have a backup, you lose your money too.


I didn't manage to get through all the paragraphs about altcoins. Ethereum isn't really a cryptocoin - it got changed by the developers when they were about to lose a bunch of value to the DAO hacker, so how can anyone trust that they won't change it again in the future, to bow to government pressure, or whatever. And isn't Ripple massively premined and centrally controlled?
If it were me I think I'd avoid talking about all the different shitcoins out there and tell people to do their own research. Most if not all will end up losing money, so don't put yourself in the position of recommending them and losing friends as a result. But whatever, that's up to you.

Right. Now you've got my point.
You expect to lose 1% of everything you wager, so you minimize your expected losses by minimizing your expected wagered amount.
I don't think it's possible to approach 49.75% chance of doubling up at a 1% house edge game, but I'm much less certain about that. From what I remember (it's been years since I did the math) I think the best I could do was 49.66% or so.
The maximum payout was capped to 0.5% of the site's bankroll at any point in time. The site needs to practice sound bankroll management to avoid the risk of ruin to a lucky streak. The [Kelly Criterion]( tells us that risking 1% of the bankroll is optimal, and that risking 0.5% is conservative, giving us [75% of the optimal expected returns]( with half the variance.

Option B, every time.
If you leave your coins on Coinbase, Coinbase get to decide who gets the forkcoins after the fork. They might decide to keep them for a few months until the price goes to zero. They might decide to keep them forever. Coins on Coinbase are not in your control.
If you move the coins to a hardware wallet, you have full control of them. It may take your wallet provider some time to provide software to split the post-fork coins, but you don't need to wait for them. You can employ a trusted third party to do the split for you, or learn how to do it for yourself.
In short, with Coinbase your coins are in the hands of a third party, and with a hardware wallet your coins are in your own hands.

I'm not familiar with blockchain.info's wallet. Well, I'm familiar enough with it that I know I don't want to get any more familiar with it, but that's beside the point.
Your transaction most likely resulted in some change being sent back to your wallet. If you can arrange to spend that change in a new transaction with a big enough fee to cover the new transaction and the old transaction, a miner will confirm both of them pretty quickly.
To do that you'll need to use a wallet which allows you to select which unspent outputs to spend. I don't know if blockchain.info's wallet lets you do that or not.
The point here is that your new transaction (with the nice big fee) can't be confirmed (and so no miner can claim the nice big fee) until its parent transaction is also confirmed - and so the miners are incentivized to confirm them both together to claim the nice big fee on the new transaction.

While is it always getting more difficulty to *mine* blocks, that has nothing to do with how long it takes to *verify* that a block was mined correctly. So that's not the issue.
The difficulty adjusts so that blocks are mined once every 10 minutes always, so that's not the issue either.
There are three issues:
1. Blocks are bigger now than they used to be. For the first year most blocks were tiny, since almost nobody was using Bitcoin. It's quicker to download and verify a small block than a big one.
2. There are more unspent outputs now than there used to be. When verifying a block, the client has to go through each new transaction in turn and check that all the coins it is spending really exist and haven't already been spent. Since there are so many unspent transactions in existence now, they don't all fit in your RAM at once, and so it has to keep going back to the disk to check. Increasing your dbcache could help with that, since you may then be able to keep them all in RAM and avoid the slow disk access.
3. The client skips signature verification for old blocks, but not for new ones. So new blocks take longer to accept than old blocks. I'm not 100% on this point. It used to be the case but I'm not sure how it works now. After checking, I see [this code]( which defines checkpoints up to block 295,000 so you can expect it to slow down at that block. There's some discussion [here]( about introducing a more recent checkpoint.

Banning their nodes means you free up slots to connect to real Bitcoin nodes.
When the fork happens, any 2X nodes you're connected to will stop relaying the blockchain to you, and you'll be isolated. You will need to find real Bitcoin nodes as soon as you can to stay up to date.
It's better to find real Bitcoin nodes now, rather that staying connected to nodes that are committed to all becoming non-nodes at the same time in the future.

That seems to be making the same mistake. Batching reduces output count.
The quoted tweet says:


That seems like an oversimplification. As batching goes up, fees go down, so it becomes cost effective to consolidate your old dust outputs, which could well lead to blocks being more input-heavy for a while.

I don't think it would be a terrible problem. We'd have less nodes than we currently have, probably. I might have given up running one already, but maybe not. There have been times when I've been pretty close to my monthly bandwidth cap due to my full Bitcoin node so it's hard to say.
I wouldn't be in favor of a contentious hard fork to reduce the blocksize to 1 MB anyway, but thankfully the blocksize limit could be reduced by a soft fork, causing much less disruption.
The problem isn't with 2MB blocks themselves, but with issues of governance and consensus.

No, the longest valid chain wins.
Chain length is for resolving accidental temporary chain splits caused when multiple miners find a block at the same time. It's not for resolving splits deliberately caused by people arbitrarily changing the consensus rules.
When the rules change in a non-backwards-compatible way you end up with a new coin, and two chains. See BCH for example. It doesn't matter whether the BTC or the BCH chain is longer. They're two separate coins. The Dogecoin chain is longer than the Bitcoin chain. Doesn't mean Dogecoin "won".

Why not?
If I buy 1 BTC from you and 1 BTC from your son there is 1 buyer and 2 sellers. One buyer can buy from many sellers.
A clearer way to think about the situation is that currently, at $3700 the buy pressure matches the sell pressure, and so the price is stable.
At $4000 there is more sell pressure than buy pressure.
At $3000 there is more buy pressure than sell pressure.
The price constantly moves such that the sell pressure balances the buy pressure as they change. The number of buyers and sellers is irrelevant. 1000 people buying 1 BTC each is the same as one person buying 1000 BTC.

No. $30 = 750k satoshi:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1e8 / 4000 * 30
    750000
There's 100 million satoshi in a BTC.
You can sanity check by doing the math roughly in your head: 
$30 is about 1% of $4k, so $30 gets you about 1% of 1 BTC, that's 1% of 100 million satoshis, or about 1 million satoshis. 750k is about a million, so the sanity check passes.

Yes, but possibly only temporarily. If the 2X chain gets more work than the BTC chain without having any blocks with a base size over 1 MB, the BTC nodes will reorg to the 2X chain, wiping out the previous blocks with the 3Bit1x addresses in it.

Well, you don't have to "claim" them. Every BTC automatically splits into BTC and the same amount of 2XC, so if you have BTC before the fork you immediately have BTC and 2XC after the fork.
The trouble comes when you try to sell your 2XC. You go to an exchange, ask them for a 2XC deposit address, they give you one, you send your 2XC to that address, and someone replays the transaction on the BTC chain.
You end up having sent your 2XC and your BTC to the same address. But the address isn't a valid deposit address in the exchange's BTC wallet, only in their 2XC wallet. So you only get credited for the 2XC that you sent and not the BTC.
You need to contact the exchange and say "I accidentally sent some BTC to my 2XC deposit address", and they choose whether to refund your BTC, credit the BTC to your BTC account at the exchange, or ignore you and treat the BTC as a gift.
I've seen some exchanges saying that they won't honor deposits of BTC to BCH addresses. I don't know where they stand legally with that. But it's a hassle neither you nor the exchange wants to have to deal with.

When I send 100 BTC to an exchange I can instantly do a visual check that the amount is correct.
Sending 100000 mBTC is error prone. Most wallets don't allow you to type "100,000", and it's hard to count the zeroes when they're all run up together like that. 100000 and 1000000 look pretty similar - again, we're back to counting digits.

Right. You don't need to interact with any specific other entity more than once to make Lightning cost effective.
If you have a channel open to your favorite dice site, and your favorite dice site has a channel open to your friend's favorite pizza restaurant, and your friend has a channel open to your friend, then you can make a payment to your friend without having to have a channel open to him. Lightning will route the payment through the dice size and the pizza restaurant for you.

It is possible to receive BTC into a regular on-chain address while you are offline. It is also possible to receive BTC into a custodial account while you are offline. But it isn't possible to receive BTC on a lightning channel while you are offline, unless somebody else is running the channel for you, and in that case it's a custodial account and you're not really using lightning.
I don't see how you think a "LN wallet" will ever be able to receive funds without having its private key online at the time. It needs the private key to sign the new transaction with the new balances.

I disagree. If you increase the blocksize to 1.25MB you create another hard fork. I currently run a Bitcoin full node. After a fork I would still only run one node. I would have to pick whether to run on the 1 MB chain or the 1.25 MB chain. I personally would stick to the 1 MB chain, but both chains would have less nodes than the 1 MB chain currently has, and so both would be more centralized than Bitcoin currently is.
The same thing happened with the Bitcoin Cash hard fork to 8 MB blocks or whatever it is that they did. I don't see how yet another hard fork ("Bitcoin 1.25x"?) helps anything.

They're running billions of hashes per second until one of them finds something that hashes to a number that is less than the current target.


The target adjusts every 2016 blocks. If blocks were found too quickly recently the target gets lower making the problem harder. And vice versa.


It doesn't. But it knows how long it took to solve the last 2016 blocks, and how long it should have taken. It adjusts the difficulty accordingly.

As I understand it, most people plug their hardware wallets directly into their online Windows machine and simply trust that whatever version of the hardware wallet firmware they're running doesn't have a bug that allows an attacker to steal their coins.

Mining is the process of repeatedly hashing transactions until you get a result that is low enough.
That "low enough" target is set by the difficulty. The higher the difficulty, the lower your hash has to be to mine a block.
The difficulty is adjusted automatically every 2016 blocks. If the last 2016 blocks were found too quickly difficulty goes up, and if they were too slow it goes down.
If the hash rate goes up, the blocks will be found too fast, and so the difficulty will go up. If the hash rate stays steady, the difficulty won't have to adjust much.

I very nearly bought $100 worth of Bitcoin when the price was $0.43.
But the service I found that sold BTC for PayPal had a maximum order of [40 BTC per week](
So I sent a payment for $17.33 for 40 BTC.
But the email address on my PayPal account didn't match the address on my order, so they returned the $17.33.
So I recreated the order using the correct email address. By now the price had fallen to $0.38 but I was determined so I sent a payment for $15.15 for 40 BTC.
I intended to keep buying 40 BTC per week until I had spent the initial $100, but after the first $15.15 purchase I forgot all about Bitcoin until I saw a story somewhere about "dollar parity".

"enter short" means "borrow some BTC and immediately sell them for USD"
"close short" means "buy back the BTC you sold, and repay the loan". If the price is lower when you close the short than when you entered it, you make a profit since you have bought low and sold high. The implication is that he enters the short position before publishing the bad news, and closes the position after the bad news is out there and the price has dropped.
"enter long" means "borrow USD and immediately use it to buy BTC"
not mentioned, but "close long" means to sell the BTC to get back the borrowed USD and then repay the loan. You would do this after everyone has figured out that the "bad news" was fake, and the price has recovered. Again, you get to profit by buying low and selling high.

It's about 1 in 4 billion. The checksum is 32 bits.
A much bigger risk is that you have some malware which changes the address between the 'copy' and 'paste' so you end up sending the coins to an address controlled by the malware.
I guess even smarter malware would change it right after you click 'send' in your wallet software, after you've visually checked it.

I've never used Jaxx. Is it possible to make multiple wallets in Jaxx from a single seed phrase?
I suspect you made two or more wallets from a single seed phrase, funded the 2nd or later one, then when you restored from the seed phrase, Jaxx is only looking in the first wallet.
Try making a 2nd or 3rd wallet and see if the transaction history shows up.
The fact that you're seeing no transaction history at all seems to imply that you're not looking at the right wallet. If your coins were stolen you'd see multiple transactions in the history (at least one funding the wallet, and one emptying it).
Feel free to PM me if you want to look in to this further with me.

@_date: 2017-10-07 10:05:02
How is this a problem?
Shorts currently owe around $4300 worth of BTC for each BTC they are short.
After the fork they'll owe $4000 worth of BTC and $300 worth of B2X for each BTC they are short (or however the values divide up).
It's as if the short forked, just like the BTCs themselves forked.
If the sum of BTC value and B2X value after the fork is less than the current BTC price then the shorts will have made a profit, won't they?
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:51:24
Well, it would probably be better if the Bitcoin difficulty adjusted after every block rather than every 2016 blocks, but it doesn't. We can't change that without a hard fork, and hard forks are hard to do safely. You need consensus, otherwise you do nothing but create yet another altcoin.

The first few times I tried to buy things using BitPay after they started using BIP70, I couldn't figure out how to do it. I use Bitcoin Core, and was used to simply copy/pasting the address and amount into the 'send' tab when paying.
It turns out that to pay using BitPay these days you have to open the 'File' menu in Bitcoin Core, then "Open URI...", and paste in the BitPay URL. Now that I know that, it's easy enough, but at first I didn't know that and so just didn't buy the things I was wanting to buy.
I wouldn't be surprised if that accounts for the 50% loss. Even if a wallet supports BIP70 it isn't always obvious *how* they support it.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; current_block = 594831
    &gt;&gt;&gt; btc_supply = (current_block - 420000) * 12.5 + 210000 * (50 + 25)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; gold_supply_in_troyoz = gold_supply_in_tons * lbs_per_ton * troyoz_per_lb
    &gt;&gt;&gt; gold_supply_in_troyoz / btc_supply

So 1 BTC is to the bitcoin supply as 309 troy ounces is to the gold supply.

There's a security aspect too. Until you spend from (or sign a message with) an address, its public key is only known by you. It's impossible for an attacker to determine your public key from your address. But when you spend from an address (or sign a message with it) you effectively publish the corresponding public key.
In the unlikely event that an attacker has a way to calculate private keys from public keys, publishing your public key lets him steal your coins.
It's not a real concern most likely, but theoretically at least address reuse is a security concern.

No, he had multiple private keys, and encrypted each of them separately with the same password, then forgot the password.
One of the addresses corresponding to one of his private keys is empty, so he can give you the encrypted private key for just that address. If you can find the password you will be able to sign a message to prove it without giving him the password. Then he will buy the password from you for 18 BTC.
You have no way of knowing in advance that he actually has any BTC. He might just have an empty address and be messing with you. And he has no way of knowing that you won't ask for 50 BTC instead of 18 BTC to reveal the password once you have figured it out. Even once you know the password you won't know how many BTC he owns on his other encrypted private keys. Even after you've sold him the password and he's moved his coins you won't know which transaction was his. You'll never know if you sold him a password that unlocked 30 BTC or 30k BTC.

The point of batching transactions is that it vastly reduces the amount of change outputs that are created and spent. If a company switches from using a separate 2 output transaction for every withdrawal to massively batching their withdrawals, they will be creating half as many outputs as they were before, while "using" Bitcoin just as much as before.
The whole point of batching is that it reduces the number of (useless) outputs.
tl;dr: Counting outputs doesn't make sense. Batching reduces change outputs, which reduces total outputs without reducing Bitcoin usage.

[BIP70]( doesn't set the fee. It sets the payment address and amount. The user is free to pay whatever fee they want.

@_date: 2019-09-20 14:15:55


Batching and Lightning both increase the average transaction size, meaning there are actually less onchain transactions per unit time, so we can expect the chart of "transactions per day" to show a decline as those are used more. The point is that both batching and Lightning allow multiple real-life economic events to be represented by each on-chain transaction.


That's flat out wrong. A pruned node fully verifies all transactions. It keeps a full copy of the UTXO set and uses that to verify new transactions. What a pruned node can't do is send old blocks to its peers.

You don't need Bitcoin Core at all to run a Lightning node. It's possible to use btcd instead for instance. And even if you do use Bitcoin Core, you don't have to compile in wallet support. A simple wallet-less Core node will work. Even a pruned one.

It doesn't have consensus behind it. It is contentious. Contentious hard forks cause a new coin to be created rather than upgrading an existing coin. That leads to confusion.


The New York "Agreement" was made by a small group of businessmen. That's not how consensus works. If the community accepts the 2x hardfork, the community is saying that they're OK with a centrally controlled coin. If that's the case, I'm not OK with the community.


If 2X has &gt;90% market share, I no longer care what is called Bitcoin and what isn't. The experiment will have failed, and we will have demonstrated that decentralized currencies can be co-opted by big business.


I would have liked it if the big block supporters would have forked off onto their own chain and left Bitcoin alone, but it seems that they won't. We have Bitcoin Cash now, and it's failing. The price drifts ever lower, the hash rate and difficulty swing up and down crazily, and the big-blocker pressure to change the real Bitcoin continues as it did before.

All three are in your wallet. You can give any of them to the person who wants to pay you.
* The `1` address is a legacy (pre-segwit) address. It's supported by all wallets for sending and receiving. The fees when spending coins received at a `1` address are higher than for the other two address types.
* The `3` address is a p2sh-wrapped segwit address. It's supported by all wallets for sending, but not all wallets can generate `3` addresses for receiving. Spending funds received at a `3` address requires less of a transaction fee than if the funds were received at a `1` address.
* The `bc1` address is a native segwit address. Not all wallets and sites can send to `bc1` addresses. Some wallets can't generate `bc1` addresses for receiving to. Some block explorers don't understand `bc1` addresses either. The fees are very slightly smaller than those for `3` addresses.
If I had to choose one to give someone to pay me with, I'd give the `bc1` address. And if they complain that they don't recognise it as a valid address I'd tell them they need to upgrade to something that supports segwit and/or give them the `3` address.

I just bought something using Bitcoin. The company I bought from use BitPay, so I had to.
I checked the mempool, saw it was empty, so included a minimal fee. BitPay immediately complained that my fee was too low, told me my transaction probably wouldn't confirm, that my wallet was misconfigured, and that I would have to wait up to 72 hours before I could get a refund.
Then 5 minutes later my transaction confirmed.

Alternatively get the privkey for the bech32 address and sign with that:
    dumpprivkey "address"

For "old" Core wallets, before it supported deterministic wallets, all the private keys were randomly generated and not at all related to each other. Access to one private key gave you no access at all to any of your others.
For "new" (deterministic / HD) Core wallets, having access to one private key still doesn't give you access to any others, even if you know the extended public key, due to Core's practice of using "hardened derivation" (read [BIP32]( for details). For most other wallets, such as the Trezor, if you have the extended public key and any single private key you can derive all the private keys at that level.


He's talking about a BIP39 mnemonic. The [word list]( contains 2016 words, several of which are longer than 6 letters. The list was designed such that no two words start with the same 4 letters - so you only need to write down the first 4 letters of each word.

I used to pay rent by standing order every month. When I left the place I was renting I cancelled the standing order but the bank paid it the next month anyway. I complained, they said they would check their records.
They came back to me and said they found a recording of the call where I cancelled it, so refunded the payment.
Then my landlord complained to the bank, saying that I owed him the money, so the bank took it back out of my account. I tried explaining that any dispute between me and my landlord was none of their business but they weren't having any of it.
They never refunded it, and I ended up giving up arguing with them. But it left a bad taste in my mouth and likely lead to me moving money into BTC as soon as I heard about it.

So long as the dishonest miner isn't able to take over the nodes of myself and the people I do business with, he can't steal any SegWit outputs that I care about. He will only be able to steal SegWit outputs on a fork of the Bitcoin chain that will be rejected by all honest nodes. I couldn't care less what happens on an invalid chain.

I found something else. Bitcoin Core nodes don't advertise their address unless `listen` is 1 *and* they are not in the initial block download phase.
`listen` is 1 by default, but your newly installed node will be in the initial block download phase for a few hours until it has finished syncing. Only once the sync is complete will it advertise its address and start receiving attempts to connect from other nodes.
This is the code, in `net_processing.cpp`:
            // Advertise our address
            if (fListen &amp;&amp; !IsInitialBlockDownload())
            {
                CAddress addr = GetLocalAddress(&amp;pfrom-&gt;addr, pfrom-&gt;GetLocalServices());
                FastRandomContext insecure_rand;
                if (addr.IsRoutable())
                {
                    LogPrint(BCLog::NET, "ProcessMessages: advertising address %s
", addr.ToString());
                    pfrom-&gt;PushAddress(addr, insecure_rand);
                } else if (IsPeerAddrLocalGood(pfrom)) {
                    addr.SetIP(addrMe);

Is that plausible?
Each day around 144 blocks are mined. So in 3 months the whole network mines around 13200 blocks. Back in 2011 the block reward was 50 BTC, so the whole network was mining 660k BTC per 3 months.
Are we to believe that one guy mined 500k BTC of those 660k? He would have needed over 75% of the total network hash power to do that.




If you have spent 3 months mining 500k BTC and then get caught, you don't delete the data from the computers without transferring the BTC to your own wallet first. What reason do we have to believe that these 500k BTC were ever lost? Anyone with a little sense would be sending the mined coins to their own address as they were mined, not leaving them on company hardware.

The encrypted private key starts with "6P".
When you entered it into the "wallet details" tab it prompted you for the password, then used that password to decrypt it, and displayed the plaintext private key (which starts with 5, K, or N).
What you should print is the encrypted version (6P...) not the unencrypted version.
So what you report is entirely reasonable - you just didn't understand what the "wallet details" tab was doing.

It isn't. It is entirely optional.


Nope. You can opt to put coins into a LN payment channel if you want to be able to transact with them cheaply and instantly without trusting a third party. You can close the channel whenever you want to.


Not true. LN uses a multisig address and smart contracts to ensure that your coins are under your control.


Yes they did. But it never happened.


Like they did when they forked Bitcoin to make their altcoin? LN isn't a separate coin. It uses real Bitcoins. LN uses send real Bitcoin transactions back and forth.


Not true.




No they don't. They say they think that in order to scare people who don't know any better.


You open channels with people. Each channel takes one on-chain transaction to open. Once open, you and the other party in the channel can send coins back and forth instantly and very cheaply without having to trust each other or wait for confirmations. You can keep doing this indefinitely without needing to use the blockchain. Both parties keep track of unbroadcast unconfirmed BTC transactions which guarantee that they can get their coins back on the chain if and when they need to. These channels can be chained together. So if A has a channel with B and B has a channel with C, A can pay C even though A and C don't have a channel with each other.


The myths make no sense when you understand what LN is and how it works.


They are targeting newcomers. Debunking their lies only works on people willing to put in the work to read deeper into the subject.


LN nodes operate channels with other nodes. LN transactions happen off-chain. Miners mine on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2018-07-21 12:47:53
By default all nodes will only attempt to make 8 outgoing connections most of the time but they will accept a large number of incoming connections.
In order for incoming connections to happen though, they need to advertise their IP address to the network, and they don't start doing that until they have finished their initial block download, which takes a day or so.
So if you install a new node, it won't see get more than 8 peers for a day or so while it syncs the chain. If you add "listen=1" to the config just as it is finishing syncing, it will start advertising its IP address (because it just finished syncing) and its connection count will start increasing, and you might conclude that your "listen=1" had some effect, when it is in fact the default setting.

@_date: 2019-09-30 15:40:29
Are you sure? I don't think transactions with zero fee are relayed through the network to miners as a matter of default node policy.
There have only been [7 zero-fee, 2 output transactions]( in the past 3 months, and those were likely made by someone with a special relationship with the miner.

Change happens if blocksize &lt; 20-percentile or 80-percentile &lt; blocksize.

Can you be said to "control" a piece of information that is known by multiple people?
Or maybe it's the fact that you could be coercing a third party to sign the message for you. That way you could provide the signed message without knowing the private key.

The only consensus is that the sum of the inputs to a transaction must be at least as big as the sum of the outputs, and that any difference between the two is a fee for the miners.
Miners are free to set their own fee policy so long as the fee isn't negative.
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:22:00


You mean "public key" here, not "address". The address is pretty much the hash of the public key. Actually it's the base58 encoding of a version byte, the ripemd160 hash of the sha256 hash of the public key, and a checksum. See [this diagram]( for details. I think these days public keys tend to be 33 bytes not 65 but otherwise that's pretty accurate.

Everyone can import those keys, and everyone then has control of all those tiny outputs. Whoever moves them somewhere safe first gets to keep them. The problem is, it costs more in transaction fees to move them than they are worth, unless you combine them with a large output to make them qualify as a free transaction, like this:

Yes. I'm running lnd with a pruned Bitcoin Core node.
The only caveat appears to be that if your lightning node goes down for a long time then by the time you restart it some blocks may have already been pruned before the node gets to see them. But if your node is going down for that long you have bigger problems anyway. Also, just increase the pruning parameter so it keeps at least a month's worth of blocks, or whatever.

In that case I think you'll need the current value of the entropy pool as well. That will allow you to 'fix' the first four bytes of the initial pool with the timestamp of the first click (assuming he didn't already click more than 64 times, damaging the pool beyond repair).
But see also [my other post]( because I think the use of window.crypto() makes things pretty hopeless.

Those 2^32 child keys are split into 2^31 from hardened derivation and 2^31 from non-hardened derivation. I don't know of any wallet that uses both kinds of derivation, so I think you're stuck with "only" 2^31 addresses, not 2^32.

First off, be very careful. Don't show the paper wallet to anyone you don't trust completely. Especially don't copy/paste parts of it to strangers online. Some people will be wanting to trick you into giving them enough information to steal your coins.
I just signed up for BitGo's wallet to see what their 'paper wallet' looks like. They told me to download and print a 2 page PDF file. The first page looks like this:
The 2nd page is a "FAQ" and contains the following text:






































































In particular, this part is encouraging:


It makes me think that you have unlimited chances to guess the passcode, since it is intended to work after BitGo ceases to exist, and so can't depend on their site being active.
On my newly downloaded paper wallet, it only shows a single (encrypted) private key (in section A) and two "xpub" public keys (sections B and C). I suspect that your paper wallet has a 2nd encrypted private key in section B - is that right? What does the descriptive text in your section B say? It seems my new wallet defaulted to using a 3rd party service called Keyternal to store the backup private key. Yours may use something different.
I think it's quite likely that the program at  can be used to reclaim the coins, especially if your paper wallet has private keys in sections A and B.
I would be willing to talk you through the process if you need help with it.

Yeah, that's not right.
The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, but the hard fork happens at block 494784, which is 864 blocks after the difficulty adjustment at block 493920, and 1152 blocks before the difficulty adjustment at block 495936.

    [raw] reject insanely high fees by default in sendrawtransaction
    
    There have been several incidents where mainnet experimentation with
    raw transactions  resulted in insane fees.  This is hard to prevent
    in the raw transaction api because the inputs may not be known.
    Since sending doesn't work if the inputs aren't known, we can catch
    it there.
    
    This rejects fees &gt; than 10000 * nMinRelayTxFee or 1 BTC with the
    defaults and can be overridden with a bool at the rpc.

It seems you don't really understand the basic concepts behind Lightning.

Each will have received an average of 100 million tenths of satoshis, for a value of 0.1 BTC each.

I'm unable to parse your question. Please state it more clearly and I'll try to answer. If you're asking whether I think a 1% house edge is much different than a 0% house edge then you can bet your ass I do. It isn't possible to make a profit long term with a 0% house edge, and it is with a 1% house edge.


It is, but that doesn't matter. Your bottom line isn't determined by how many gamblers bust and how many don't. It is determined by the sum of all their profits and losses. If 99 out of 100 gamblers bust but the 100th wins more than those 99 lost then you are running at a net loss.


You are looking at it wrong. We aren't talking about games of skill, we are talking about games of luck. The gambler's mind really doesn't matter. All that really matters long term is the house edge and the total turnover. The gamblers can be thinking whatever they like as they play. It won't affect your expected profit.


It isn't a valid excuse, but it could be used as an excuse - a lie to explain why the winning player hasn't seen his winnings yet. It really isn't a very good excuse, but it could be adapted (send them a transaction with a malleated input, for example, and when it takes a long time to confirm try to tell them that it's because "blocks are full". Roger Ver used that one a while ago and it took us a while to notice what was goingon).
I don't know if you're the one running the site, but if it is you, and you think that you will make a profit due to "gambler greed" or some such, you really need to look at the math of the situation before you find yourself unable to pay your debts. If you're interested I can dig up an old bitcointalk forum thread about this very idea. As I remember it I eventually managed to convince that thread's OP that his idea of running a 0% house edge site and profiting from "gambler greed" was a bad one.

Bitcoin's chain is whichever valid chain contains the most proof of work.
Suppose you had been in a coma for the last 3 years and woke up today. You would look at the Bitcoin chain and the Bcash chain and be able to tell which one was the real Bitcoin chain because the Bcash chain isn't valid according to Bitcoin's rules, on at least 2 counts: a few of its blocks are too big to be valid (they break the blocksize limit rule), and lots of its blocks don't have enough proof of work to be valid (they break the difficulty rule). Since the Bcash chain isn't even valid, it doesn't matter which one contains the most proof of work, because we only compare the amount of proof of work on valid chains.

No. The signatures are in a separate part of the block. There is a hash of them in the coinbase transaction though.


The transaction hash doesn't hash the witness part of the transaction, and so the signatures don't affect it. This is independent of whether the hash of the witness part of the block is in the coinbase transaction or not.


Yes, and yes (assuming that "LN funding" refers to opening a payment channel). Anyone who wants to use legacy transactions with the legacy malleability bug is free to do so. SegWit provides a way of avoiding malleability, but doesn't force itself on you.
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:16:18
Transaction fees are very low right now. It's a good time to consolidate your small outputs into fewer bigger ones at SegWit addresses.
Then if and when the people attacking Bitcoin start spamming the mempool again pushing fees higher you'll save money by being able to spend from SegWit addresses rather than legacy ones.
Transaction malleability isn't a big deal for most people unless they're trying to spend unconfirmed change, chain unconfirmed transactions together, or think that tracking transactions by txid is a good idea.

I was looking at the source of bitaddress.org, hoping to find a way to regenerate private keys from the stored initial entropy pool. The code makes an in-memory copy of the entropy pool the first time it is used:
    for (sr.pptr = 0; sr.pptr &lt; sr.pool.length; ++sr.pptr)
            sr.poolCopyOnInit[sr.pptr] = sr.pool[sr.pptr];
but I fear it's hopeless because of the following code:
    sr.prototype.nextBytes = function (ba) {
            var i;
            if (window.crypto &amp;&amp; window.crypto.getRandomValues &amp;&amp; window.Uint8Array) {
                    try {
                            var rvBytes = new Uint8Array(ba.length);
                            window.crypto.getRandomValues(rvBytes);
                            for (i = 0; i &lt; ba.length; ++i)
                                    ba[i] = sr.getByte() ^ rvBytes[i];
                            return;
                    } catch (e) {
                            alert(e);
                    }
            }
            for (i = 0; i &lt; ba.length; ++i) ba[i] = sr.getByte();
    };
That is mixing the (predictable) output of the SecureRandom RNG with the (unpredictable?) output of the window.crypto RNG. The mixing only happens if window.crypto is available and a couple other conditions are met. We can check that by running this in the console:
    &gt; window.crypto &amp;&amp; window.crypto.getRandomValues &amp;&amp; window.Uint8Array &amp;&amp; true
    &lt; true
If it replies "true" then I don't think there's any chance of replaying the key generation (unless there's some way of finding the initial entropy pool for window.crypto's RNG), and so finding it somewhere in memory seems like the only hope.

I don't know why other mining pools would even recognize that as a block worth mining on top of. It's 10 minutes after the previous block so there's no excuse for not confirming some transactions.
If they're not willing to include transactions in their blocks why should they get to take a block reward and contribute to the rising difficulty?

Both stated facts are true and not twisted:
1) Bitcoin allows ASICboost, both convert and overt. Mining a Segwit block prevents covert ASICboost, but miners can choose to mine legacy blocks on the Bitcoin chain if they want to. And if they want to mine Segwit blocks, they can still use overt ASICboost (version churning, etc.)
2) Segwit was a soft fork. Nobody is forced to use it. Miners can continue mining legacy blocks just like before the fork. When they do so, they can use the full range of ASICboost techniques, just like BCash miners can.
Where did I oversimplify or twist any facts?

It depends what you mean by "secure", but no, not really.
When you have money in your paypal account you are trusting paypal to let you have access to it. They can (and often do) decide to freeze your account at any time if they don't like the kinds of things you use your account for. That's not what I would call "secure".
With Bitcoin, if you hold your own private keys, you are in control of your own money. Nobody can freeze your "account". But you are responsible for your own security.
I guess it comes down to whether you trust paypal or yourself more. Sadly for most people the answer is probably that they trust paypal more than themselves to keep their money safe and accessible.

I had an old laptop that I retired and used as a media server. It was full disk encrypted and had an old Bitcoin wallet on it. Eventually I stopped using it at all until recently when I decided I should check whether it contained any funded wallets. I couldn't for the life of me remember the disk encryption password. I knew for sure that one of the keys on the keyboard was failing, and so I was unable to type the passphrase reliably, and had worked around that. Had I replaced an 'a' with a ' Or an 'e' with a '3'? I must have tried hundreds of combinations of replacements but none of them worked. Eventually I wrote a script to try all possible combinations of replacements. After hours of running it finally came up with the passphrase: I had replaced the broken keyboard character with nothing at all. So instead of "password", it was simple "pssword", so that I could type it as normal and have it work even though the 'a' key was broken.
None of the wallets contained any BTC after all that, but it kept me busy for longer than it should have.

Each channel has two endpoints. Your LN wallet will likely open and manage several channels. Payments can be chained over channels. So if you have a channel with Alice, and Alice has a channel with Bob, you can pay Bob even if you don't have a channel with him by sending payment through Alice.

Do you remember a couple of months when Roger Ver was complaining about how a large transaction he made wasn't confirmed for days, and blamed it on "full blocks"? It turned out the actual cause was transaction malleability. His large transaction was created using unconfirmed change. The change he spent was malleated and so the large transaction was invalid.
Doubling the blocksize limit wouldn't have solved his problem.
Using SegWit would have solved his problem.
He thought his 'stuck' transaction was an argument for bigger blocks, but it was really an argument for fixing transaction malleability.

I was buying coins when they were less than a dollar each. I was still buying them when they were $5 each, and even when they were $100 each.
I'm not buying them any more, because as you said it is now very hard to significantly increase the number of coins I own by buying them.
Another way of saying it is that if you are 10% in BTC and 90% in USD before a 100x BTC price increase, then you are 91.7% in BTC and 8.3% in USD after the 100x price increase, without changing your position at all. At that point you have too much of your wealth in BTC and it doesn't make any sense to use the remaining 8% that is still in USD to buy more BTC.
But that doesn't mean the number of coins I own doesn't and won't increase. It just doesn't increase significantly. I am still willing to accept Bitcoin as payment for goods and services, and doing so increases the number I hold - just not by much.

Multiplying the limit by 8, and then doubling it every 2 years until it is over 8000 times bigger than before you started fucking with it gives "stress testers" (aka attackers) much more ability to bloat the chain and max out your bandwidth.

No, miners don't matter; they only enforce the rules. It's the economic majority that matters. That's why Segwit was activated even though the majority of the hashrate was against it. The threat of UASF forced their hand.


Miners vote on which one *of the valid chains* to extend. They don't get to decide which chains are valid.
There's nothing wrong with using a difficulty adjustment. Bitcoin itself has a rule which adjusts the difficulty every 2016 blocks, and that's fine. What's wrong with changing the difficulty adjustment rule is that it makes a new chain unless agreed to by the vast majority of users.
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:41:03


I don't think that's the case. We wait for a confirmation anyway when opening a channel and so malleability isn't a problem there.
Malleability only becomes a problem for the off-chain transactions which we sign but don't broadcast. So as long as the outputs of the opening transaction use SegWit addresses we're good.

Having researched this further I don't think you are right there.
The Unlimited people consider the blocksize limit to not be part of the Bitcoin consensus at all. They consider there to not actually be a blocksize limit (because you could edit your miner's source code and change it to whatever you like!)
There is no 95% threshold. They write:


So each miner sets their own blocksize limit. I can say "I only accept 1 MB blocks until I see a bigger block with a million blocks mined on top of it" and I'm effectively following the existing Bitcoin consensus. You can say "I mine and accept 2 MB blocks". We will each be on our own fork of the chain. It will be like the Ethereum fork, only worse because there will be multiple incompatible branches, not only 2.

It would be useful to clarify what we mean by "segwit transactions".
A transaction can:
* a) create a new segwit output (ie. one which requires a signature in the segregated witness section to spend it) or
* b) spend an old segwit output (ie. by including a signature in the segregated witness section).
For the purposes of this question, the first kind of transaction isn't really relevant. Our unupgraded client won't have any segwit addresses and so won't be receiving any segwit outputs.
So we're looking at the second kind. Someone is using their old segwit outputs as inputs to fund a regular old transaction to us. To our old client these inputs look like regular P2SH inputs with a trivially satisfied script ("anyone can spend") and so we accept them.
The problem comes when the person sending us the transaction uses other people's segwit outputs as his inputs. He won't be able to sign those outputs correctly as far as ungraded clients are concerned, but our client won't know that. It will presumably accept the transaction on face value and show it as unconfirmed.
As so an un-upgraded client could be tricked into thinking is had received a valid transaction when it reality the transaction was funded by other people's segwit outputs and will never confirm (unless an un-upgraded miner creates a block, but even then the block will quickly be orphaned by the majority of segwit miners).
I'm no expert and could well be wrong here. Am I?
Edit: here's [sipa's answer to the question]( on stackexchange. He seems to be saying it's not a problem because the transaction won't propagate because it's non-standard. But what if the scammer connects directly to our node and feeds us his transaction. Does standardness matter then, or will our old client just display the transaction?

I didn't mention shorting in the comment you replied to, but broadly speaking, shorting is the act of borrowing something (with collateral) so you can sell it (because you think its price will go down) and then buy it back later (after the price goes down) to pay off the loan, and make some profit for yourself.
So you might deposit 10 BTC to an exchange, and use it as collateral to borrow 100 BTC (10x leverage), then sell the 100 BTC for $35000, wait for the price to drop, buy the 100 BTC back for $30000, repay the loan, then withdraw the $5k profit as well as your original 10 BTC (minus fees).
The risk is that the price rises instead of falling. If at any time the price rises high enough that the $35000 (which you made from selling the borrowed 100 BTC) is only worth enough to buy back 90 BTC, then your $35k is used to buy back 90 BTC, and that 90 BTC together with your original 10 BTC deposit is used to repay the loan. You're down 10 BTC.

I see this quite often. Bitcoin isn't unlike fiat in that respect. Neither is backed by anything.
If fiat currency was backed by something, that would mean you were guaranteed to be able to exchange each unit of the fiat currency for a certain amount of whatever it was backed by.
For example, the USD used to be backed by gold. There was a promise that each dollar could be exchanged for a certain amount of gold. That is no longer the case. There is no longer any backing.

I disagree. If 90% of the miners decided to change the block reward from 12.5 BTC per block back to 50 BTC per block at midnight tonight they would have effectively quit their Bitcoin mining jobs and switched to a new altcoin fork. They could claim to still be mining Bitcoin, but few would agree with them.
You seem to have it backwards. The miners work for us. If they don't follow the consensus rules they are no longer working for us and so don't get paid (other than in tokens on their new forked chain, which are likely worthless).

I tried sending 9 BTC using Bitcoin Core 4 hours ago. I let it include whatever the default fee is. It is still unconfirmed.

Roger's $23k transaction relied on an input that was maleated before it confirmed, rendering his $23k transaction unconfirmable forever. No matter what the blocksize limit is, no matter what fee he included and how long he waited, it is not possible to get a transaction into the blockchain if its inputs are already double spent.
It's a shame that Roger doesn't ask for informed advice before making posts like this.

People are buying and selling all the time.
It may sound kind of obvious, but every time a bitcoin is sold, it is also bought by someone else, so the total number of 'owned' coins doesn't change when a trade is made.
The price always adjusts to the point where the upward price pressure from buyers balances with the downward price pressure from sellers.

(Trying a trillion rearrangements per second will take an average of 10 thousand years to stumble upon the correct one.

When you go short BTC you are putting up some collateral against which you borrow some BTC, sell the borrowed BTC, wait for the price of BTC to fall, then buy the BTC back, pay off the loan, and make a profit. If the price of BTC goes up too far instead of down the exchange will use your collateral to make up the extra require to repay your loan.
When you go long BTC (with leverage) you are putting up some collateral against which you borrow some USD, use it to buy some BTC, wait for the price of BTC to rise, then sell the BTC back, pay off the loan, and make a profit. If the price of BTC goes down too far instead of up then exchange will sell your borrowed BTC at a loss and use your collateral to make up extra required to repay your loan.
Basically, when you go short you are betting that the price will fall, and when you go long you are betting that the price will rise.

Because with a 0% edge the player also cannot make a profit long term. At 0% house edge both sides break even (and get eaten by fees). There's also the issue that I have no reason to believe that you would be willing or able to pay out if I got lucky and hit too many big wins in a row, but I am quite confident that if I got unlucky a lot you would be quite happy to keep my coins. This imbalance of outcomes makes it a -EV game for me.


I've no idea what your bankroll is. I couldn't find any mention of it on your site. Is it even public?


It's not a game of skill. Psychology plays no part in it.
Suppose you have 1000 very greedy customers. Each one starts out with 1 BTC and bets 1 BTC on your game over and over for a month or until they go broke. What do you think your expected profit will be?
Alternatively, suppose you have 1000 very conservative customers. Each one starts out with 1 BTC, bets 0.01 BTC on your game repeatedly, but quits as soon as they win a single bet. What do you think your expected profit is then?
The answer is that in both cases your expected profit is 0 BTC whether the players are very greedy or very conservative.
As far as your bottom line is concerned all players are the same person. It doesn't matter to you where one player stops playing and the next starts. It really is all just math.

This was the first time your wallet needed to use your initial large coin. Until now your spends have been funded with smaller coins that you didn't care so much about and so you didn't notice it making change. But if you look at your old transactions you'll likely see that they all have 2 outputs - 1 going to whoever you were paying, and the other going back to a new address in your wallet.
Edit: check out [this transaction]( where they try to combine ten 50k outputs into a single 500k output, but the wallet actually takes eleven inputs and gives 50k back as change. This was likely due to a bug - it would have been possible to only use ten inputs and avoided the change completely.

You don't know how percentages work.
Consider this:
    $1 to $2 is a 200% move
    $2 to $4 is a 200% move
    so $1 to $4 is a 200*200 = 40,000% move
It's not right, is it!
You need to divide each percentage by 100, multiply them all together, then multiply by 100 again
    So $1 to $4 is a (200/100) * (200/100) * 100 = 400% move.
More reasonable, right?

There was [this one time]( when someone found a way of creating a few billion bitcoins out of thin air. But the bug was fixed quickly, and the bad transaction was reorganized out of the chain.






Is this true? I've never provided my ID to any exchange.


I'm not sure about that whole 'community interaction' section. I don't care if an exchange engages publicly so long as it works well, is secure, trustworthy, etc. If you are going to include that section, I think it would be worthwhile to name names. Made up examples: Coinbase engage well on reddit, BitFinex regularly organize hackathons, Poloniex is open source (is any exchange open source?) etc.

Telling someone to "buy a hardware wallet" is not technical advice, nor overly complex.
Most people run Windows and Android. Both are insecure, and not a good place to store Bitcoins. Hence the advice: "buy a hardware wallet".
What do you have against that sound advice?

If sha256 was compromised to the extent that it was trivially easy to find preimage collisions, but ripemd and ecdsa were both uncompromised, what impact would it have on Bitcoin's security?
I'd maybe be able to make two transactions with the same txid, but would it matter? One would confirm, the other wouldn't. I'm not convinced security would be compromised.
I guess it's possible that mining would get a lot easier, depending on whether we had enough control over the collisions to find valid blocks (mining uses a double sha256 and so may survive even a successful preimage attack).

I'm not sure whether you're trying to be funny or not.
When you sell a BTC for $550, someone else is buying it for $550.
If you sell the BTC back to me, you have made a $50 profit and I have made a $50 loss. An additional $50 has entered your pocket, and left mine. There has been some "capital flight" from my pocket to yours since I made a bad trade (sell low, buy high) and you made a good trade (buy low, sell high).
I don't see how this additional $50 has in any sense entered the BTC market.

A couple of weeks ago someone paid me an amount of BTC which made my wallet balance in satoshis end with 6 zeroes. He had no idea what my balance was, and picked the amount to send me just because it looked cool. That's a one-in-a-million chance of happening on any random transaction. :)

If you have a paper wallet with 1000 BTC on it, scan it with BreadWallet, and ask BreadWallet to send 500 BTC to an address of your choosing, I've no idea what it would do with the other 500 BTC. It's likely that your whole 1000 BTC is in a single output, and it's not possible to spend just part of an output.
Most wallets will create a 'change' output to a new address, but when spending from a paper wallet it's not clear what it will do with the change. I would recommend experimenting with small paper wallets to see exactly what BreadWallet does with the change when spending from a paper wallet.
It is not really a good idea to send the change back to the address it "came from" because that private key is no longer "cold".
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:26:07
The whole Bitcoin system works on base units called satoshis. There are 100 million satoshis per bitcoin.
It was entirely an arbitrary choice to define "1 bitcoin" to be 100 million satoshis.
It is entirely reasonable to buy a tenth of a bitcoin for $30. That is 10 million satoshis.
If you go too small then the transaction fees become increasingly significant. It's not unusual to see transaction fees of around 0.0001 BTC. That's 10 thousand satoshis (or around 3 US  cents at the current price).

Where does the 15% number come from?
I can imagine a scenario where BIP148 has 15%, the legacy chain has 60% and the remaining 25% is dedicated to orphaning all the BIP148 blocks and replacing them with empty blocks.
In that case 15% doesn't look like enough. But I see people keep saying that it is, so where am I wrong?

It sounds like the transaction that paid you the 100 BTC never confirmed, and so neither did your spend of 55 BTC.

There is a simple way of having a third party generate a vanity address for you without them being able to know the private key.
Check the 'vanity wallet' tab of bitaddress.org for details. Basically, you generate a pair of keys, give the public key to the third party, they use that to generate a private key which when combined with your private key will give you a private key which has the vanity prefix you wanted. Sounds complex, but works very well. I've used it many times to pay others to generate addresses for me.
Since bitcoinvanitygen.com don't offer this as part of their service I would assume that they aren't trustworthy. Because otherwise why wouldn't they?
Here's a step-by-step:
1) use bitaddress.org to generate your keypair:
2) use vanitygen with the public key you just generated to search for the address you want:
3) use bitaddress to combine the two private keys to get a third, which corresponds to the address you wanted:

Your argument is that if the price doesn't go up Bitfury would lose money, therefore the price must go up?
Isn't it also possible that the price doesn't go up and Bitfury loses money?
I don't see how your conclusion follows from your statement.
Sure Bitfury could refuse to sell any coins for less than $600, but that won't stop anyone else from selling below that price.

I made an even dumber mistake after that... I set the wallet to include a fee of 0.00025 per kB, to make sure my next transaction confirmed quickly for sure. Then I sent all my remaining coins to an exchange to sell them.
Can you see where this is going yet?
One of my "remaining coins" is the change from the first transaction, which isn't confirming. And so the 2nd transaction also won't confirm, no matter how much fee I pay, because it depends on the first transaction confirming.

Yes, it's true.
The fundamental problem we have is that nobody is in control of the system. That's a good thing, because power corrupts - we don't want it to be too easy for governments to destroy Bitcoin by removing the 21 million coin limit for example - but it's a bad thing when we need to upgrade the system for example to increase transaction throughput.
Bitcoin's resilience to change cuts both ways. Changes require significant support by the userbase.

If you're really using m/44/0/0/ as your derivation path then that's not safe, and leaking any private key can compromise them all. But BIP44 says to use hardened derivation for accounts:
See 






and so that's what any BIP44 wallets I have seen actually do. This should mean that leaking keys for one account won't affect security of your other accounts. However if you leak the 24 seed words then all bets are off.

This seems like a strange question to me.
What if I asked you, as a US dollar hodler, if you will ever sell.
Is there some point, when the US dollar is worth 0.01 BTC say, that you would sell your dollars and buy a house?
Do you think one day the US dollar will replace money?
If the price of the US dollar falls to one 10 thousandth of a Bitcoin I wouldn't be tempted to buy any US dollars, unless I needed some US dollars for something. And I wouldn't be tempted to exchange them for a house unless I needed a house.
This is nothing about being "dedicated" to Bitcoin. It just seems to be a better store of value than other types of money.

The argument isn't "we need a 2 MB blocksize limit because that's the right size".
The argument is "we need a 2 MB blocksize limit because 1 MB blocks are sometimes full".
That argument works just the same when 2 MB blocks get full, and 4 MB blocks. And you end up with the 8192 MB blocksize limit that Mike Hearn proposed for Bitcoin XT.

I expect they would put the stolen satoshi coins up for auction in blocks like they did with the stole Silk Road coins.
However they do it, it's an effective increase in supply and so we have to expect it to produce downwards pressure on the market price.

The reason Roger's transaction didn't confirm is that one of its inputs suffered from transaction malleability.
Increasing the blocksize would not have helped with this at all.
SegWit would absolutely have prevented this problem, since it prevents transaction malleability.
Shouting "bigger blocks now" in response to every problem without first taking the time to understand the problem just makes you look silly, especially when in this particular case "bigger blocks" would not have helped in the slightest.

Then why even bother with a block chain? If all the data is in trusted datacentres then you don't need a block chain. Use a regular database.
@_date: 2016-05-01 06:10:10
Transactions can get away without paying a fee if their inputs are old enough and/or big enough.
As a rule of thumb, calculate the age (in days) times the value (in BTC) of each input. Average it over all the inputs. If you get a number greater than 1 then you don't need to pay a fee.
So spending a 0.1 BTC output that is 10 days old is free. And so on.
I may a bit off with my numbers here, but I think it's pretty close to the truth.
@_date: 2016-05-18 04:49:57
The biggest problem with the change you propose is that it is a hard fork. Anyone who doesn't hear about the change or anyone who chooses not to update their node software will be working on a different chain than the people who did upgrade.
Having said that, I've seen talk on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about using a hard fork if the hashrate does drop massively after the halving.

When you use Mycelium you are sending your xpub to the Mycelium server. So the Mycelium guys can trivially link all your addresses together, as can anyone they share your xpub with.
Also, Mycelium gives you no control over which utxos you spend, so you will end up linking your addresses together publicly by spending from multiple addresses per transaction.

When you use Electrum you connect to an Electrum server and tell it which addresses you control. It then tells you how many Bitcoins you have. That can be seen as "disclosing personal information".

That's  the part where you went wrong. Each time the shown address receives funds, a new (empty) address is shown, so you don't use the same address twice.

You misunderstand a few things:


The 24 words can be used to recover all of your private keys, so backup up the 24 words is equivalent to backing up your private keys.


Buy another one, enter the 24 words, carry on as before.


Buy a Trezor, enter the 24 words, carry on as before. Or use any of the compatible software wallets, enter the 24 words, carry on.


No. Your 24 word seed generates an almost infinite number of private keys. There's no need to back up anything every 50 transactions. You only need to back up the 24 words, and they don't change.


The problem with a paper backup is that if anyone finds it, they can take all your coins.
A partial solution to this is that you can use a passphrase in combination to the 24 words. If you store the passphrase separate from the 24 words that gives you some extra security. A problem with that is that it's pretty fast to brute force passphrases, so you need to pick a good long random one to be able to resist a brute force attack for a decent amount of time. Think of the passphrase as a 25th word. You can pick any phrase you like, and each one gives you a completely different set of private keys.

Simply by not increasing the blocksize limit to placate "bitcoin will die if we don't" alarmists.


I check the price occasionally. It goes up and down a lot. It has been more stable recently than at the start.


I've looked at the price of Ether and Monero recently. I don't think I've ever looked at the others. I don't think I've even heard of SCJX.


Some blocks are full, some aren't. When attacks are mounted on the network to "prove" that we must "do something now or Bitcoin will die" more blocks are full than at other times. That is to be expected. It would also be the case if the blocksize limit was 2 MB, as the attackers would then be pushing for 4 MB blocks. Don't think that a single doubling would placate them.


Bitcoin used to have a zero market cap. That would have been the all-time low.


The price drop may be the result of people believing the hype that "Bitcoin will die". It's hard to say.




The end goal is for transaction fees to completely cover the cost of mining, since the block reward will continue halving until it is zero. A gradual increase in transaction fees is better than no increase at all, else how do we get from mining being paid for by inflation to mining being paid for by transaction fees?
CLAM has a 1 CLAM per block reward with no halving. That 1 CLAM becomes a smaller percentage of the money supply with each block that is mined, and so a similar problem exists.

Cold means "not online".
If you keep your wallet on a machine that is never connected to the Internet I would consider that to be cold storage. Or if you keep it on paper, that's cold too.
But regularly plugging your wallet into a potentially virus-ridden Internet-connected computer can't be considered "cold" I don't think. You're relying on the hard wallet's firmware being bug-free as your only defense against your private keys leaking to an attacker. Cold wallets don't and can't "leak".

I think you have that a little wrong.
HLTCs are used any time a payment is routed through one or more intermediaries, but usually don't result in anything being broadcast to the blockchain.
As I understand it, transactions are only broadcast to the blockchain when a channel is opened and when it is closed. Commitment transactions are passed around every time a payment is made, but they typically aren't broadcast unless one of the parties stops cooperating or wants to close the channel.

Actually Bitcoin Core implemented "HD" (ie. hierarchical deterministic) wallets maybe 6 months ago. So that wiki page is out of date now, and for new wallets created using recent versions of Bitcoin Core you don't need to make regular backups. Unfortunately their implementation is incompatible with existing hardware wallets, so you won't be able to use your seed words there. 
I would recommend [Mycelium wallet on Android]( if you trust your phone not to be infected with malware. I believe [CoPay]( will work too, and runs on a wide variety of platforms.
[This web page]( is a good resource for recovering your private keys if all you have is your 24 word seed. I would recommend downloading a copy of it to a USB stick, and loading it up on an offline machine, just so no malware can spy on you while you type your 24 words. But it's good to have an offline copy of a simple tool that can turn your 24 words into as many private keys as you need. Put your 24 word seed into the "BIP39 Mnemonic" field and you'll see your receiving addresses along with their private keys listed in the BIP44 tab. Change the 0 to 1 in the "External / Internal" field and you'll see your change addresses along with their private keys.

Some nits:

The price of Bitcoin has risen faster than inflation in the past. I don't see why it couldn't also happen in the future.

Your problem is that your remaining outputs are worth less than the transaction fee required to spend them.
If you import their private keys into a better funded wallet, you will be able to afford the transaction fee required to spend them, but will probably still make a loss spending them, since including the tiny outputs in a new transaction makes that transaction bigger, which makes it more expensive.
It's good for the network to spend the dust, rather than throw it away, because otherwise everyone has to remember it forever in the UTXO set.

I understand the appeal of using 'bits' instead of BTC. You end up with at most two decimal places in all your money amounts, much like every other currency.
The problem is that almost nobody uses it, and so when one wallet insists that their users convert decimal BTC amounts to 'bit' amounts they are expecting too much of their users. People have a hard time with decimals. Multiplying a decimal BTC amount by 1 million to convert it to bits is hard and error prone, even for those of us who do understand what's going on.

I think "smart contact" may be overstating it since it is just a single regular transaction. The way the transaction is constructed doesn't allow any party to steal from the others. There's one "taker" who wants to make a coinjoin for a particular amount and is willing to pay a small fee to do so, and many "makers" who are willing to offer that service for a fee. It goes like this:
* The taker asks all the makers how much they have available for coinjoining.
* The makers all reply, with their amounts and fee information.
* The taker decides which makers he wants to deal with, and tells them each the amount he wants to join with them.
* The makers reply with a list of their unspent outputs which sum to at least the required amount, and a pair of receiving addresses (one for the joined amount, one for the change).
* The taker constructs an unsigned transaction from all that information and sends it to each of the makers.
* Each maker checks that the transaction is paying himself correctly, then signs each of his inputs to the transaction and sends the signatures to the taker.
* The taker signs his own inputs, adds in all the maker signatures and broadcasts the transaction.

So the concern is that miners will be able to risk mining invalid blocks, just like they are already able to do?
What's the new risk exactly?
If miners want to be sure they're doing valid work, they need to validate the block they are building on top of. They are free not to do that work, at the risk of wasting their effort if it turns out the parent block is invalid. SegWit doesn't change that as far as I can see.

No, you have it backwards.
You're a miner. You have all the information needed to make a new block (previous block hash, list of transactions, etc.) except for the nonce. You try lots of different nonces until you find one that makes your new block hash to a number that is lower than the current network target.
When you find such a nonce, you publish it, and win.
To simplify it, suppose instead of hashing, the mining algorithm used addition. And to make a block, you had to have the block 'sum to 1000'. Suppose the transactions sum to 842. Your job as a miner is to find a nonce that makes the sum be 1000. Only subtraction hasn't been invented. So you try nonce=1. That makes the block sum to 843. No good, try again. Try nonce=2. That gives sum=844. No good, try again. Eventually you try nonce=158. That gives sum=1000 and you win.
Now if subtraction had been invented, you could easily calculate the nonce as 1000-842. Subtraction is "addition in reverse". If subtraction didn't exist you would have to try all different nonces until you found one that worked. But subtraction does exist, so this isn't a very good mining algorithm.
On the other hand "hashing in reverse" doesn't exist, so you have to try all different nonces until you find a working one.
Does that help?

One day a passing tourist offers me $50 for a rabbit.
Are my 9 remaining rabbits now worth $450, because the last sale was at $50?
No, the remaining rabbits are still worth $10 each. There was very limited demand at the ATH price, and it's silly to multiply the last price by the number of rabbits and think that the resulting number represents anything real.
Similarly if I have a million BTC and try selling them, the price will drop considerably. The first few might bring me $520 each, but the last ones will bring me much less.
This is without even considering that 2 of my 10 rabbits have lost their private keys forever. And who wants to buy a rabbit with no private key?

The whole point of Ethereum was "smart contracts", where computer code decides and enforces contracts instead of old men in wigs.
Then, when the creator of Ethereum made an investment in a contract which he didn't fully understand the details of, causing him to lose money, he made a new forked version of Ethereum in which that particular contract was overridden, so he got his money back.
Ethereum Classic is the original version, where "code is the law", where contracts are enforced by code. What people now call "Ethereum" is the version where the founder gets to step in and change the rules if he accidentally makes a bad investment. It's like the old system only instead of old men in wigs we have a young man in a t-shirt.

You can send the payment to a mutually trusted escrow agent, and have them release the coins to the seller only after you have received the goods. Note that you both have to trust the escrow agent not to steal the coins.
Alternatively, you can set up a 2-of-3 multi-signature Bitcoin address with the seller and an escrow agent. Any 2 of the 3 of you (You, the seller, and the escrow agent) to move the coins. You send the coins to that address, and once you have received the goods you and the seller can sign a transaction which moves the coins to the seller's address. In the event of a dispute, you and the seller will be unwilling to sign the same transaction since you'll be disagreeing about who should get the coins. At that point the escrow agent decides who to side with and cooperates with them to get them the coins. In this situation the escrow agent can't singlehandedly steal the coins, but he could team up with the seller to defraud you.


What happens if you sell something worth $500 to someone, and they pay you using a credit card, and then later they charge-back the payment? I think you end up out of pocket and also have to pay a fee on top of that. (I'm not sure about this; maybe the credit card company covers the loss and charges you enough in processing fees to make up for it; obviously they're not really taking the loss, you are).
Of course, you could use a Bitcoin payment processor instead and have them take on the risk that the transaction will never confirm in exchange for paying them a small percentage of each transaction.

Yes it can, and that's the crucial point.  The Bitcoins themselves are on the blockchain. What OP found was a wallet containing private keys which let him move the Bitcoins.
It's like if you bought a desk in an estate sale and found that one of the drawers contained the key to a safety deposit box.
Do you have the right to empty the safety deposit box when you find the key? It's quite possible that there is another copy of the key, and that it will be sold separately by the estate.
Some people will claim that if you have access to Bitcoin private keys then you own the Bitcoins secured by those keys. I don't think it's that simple. By that measure Coinbase "own" all the Bitcoins in their users' accounts.
It's clear that Coinbase *controls* all those coins, but it's a stretch to say they *own* the coins. Of course, that doesn't stop them being able to steal the coins one day if they want to. MtGox never owned the coins its users had on deposit, but that didn't stop the coins from going missing.

You have it wrong.
Read the spec here: 
There is no mention of a hard fork, and no mention of "2x" at all.
BIP91 was signalling on bit 4 only, and once activated by having 80% of miners signal with bit 4, it orphans all blocks which don't signal for plain old soft-fork SegWit (BIP141, bit 1).
tl;dr: **BIP91 is nothing to do with a hard fork. It is everything to do with activating SegWit as a soft fork.**

This is what I don't understand. People talk about "money entering Bitcoin", presumably meaning USD. But for every USD that is exchanged for BTC, BTC is also exchanged for USD. There are two sides in every exchange. Every time you "toss some fiat into BTC", your counterparty is "tossing some BTC into fiat" at the same time. So where's this "flight" that we keep hearing about?

Probably like this:
If half the hashrate stops mining then it will be twice as easy to mine, and that will make up for the halving of the block reward. The remaining 50% will be profitable again.
Except, of course, the difficulty doesn't adjust until after 2016 blocks have been mined and so the argument fails. Selfishly my best strategy (maybe, if my only cost is electricity, and I ignore sunk hardware costs) as a barely profitable miner is to stop mining and wait for the other suckers to mine the first 2016 blocks after the halving, then start again once they have done it, and benefit from the new lower difficulty.

`git` allows you to download a verified source for bitcoin.
`gitian` allows multiple people to build identical binaries from those sources. Before gitian every binary built would be slightly different, due to timestamps and various other factors. So now multiple people can sign off on a binary's hash, meaning that we can be more sure that the builder's build system wasn't compromised.
I don't see how "it doesn't matter who can merge pull requests because we have a system that allows repeatable builds" makes any sense (paraphrasing Gavin). Maybe he's alluding to the fact that the `bitcoin` github account is also used to host downloadable binaries, and if the wrong people had control of that they could host backdoored binaries if we didn't have gitian to allow others to verify that the binaries match the sources.

1) Yes. If by "the block" you mean the area limited to 1 MB. Each SegWit block will come with an additional part which is just the signatures for the SegWit transactions in that block.
2) The p2p protocol is upgraded to allow peers to request witness data from each other. They propagate the network much the same as legacy block data does - peer to peer flooding. You can prune them if you like, or even just never download them if you don't care about validating signatures. Pruning is user-settable, the same as block pruning is currently. Bitcoin Core already allows you to throw away old block data, keeping only the most recent N GB of blocks if you want. Pruning is turned off by default.
3) SegWit is effectively a blocksize limit increase, yes. In addition to the 1 MB of legacy block data there will be a similar amount (but up to 3 MB) of witness data associated with each block. This means more bandwidth is required for those wishing to run a fully validating node. This is why Core developers say SegWit is a compromise towards bigger blocks, because when used it effectively doubles the on-chain capacity.
4) You probably mean "in a transaction". Nobody cares if a block's hash gets maleated. Changing a block's hash requires re-mining it, and is pointless. So we only care about transaction maleability. When the sender signs a transaction, he is signing the hash of the transaction (with the signature masked out), so if anything other than the signature changes the signature is invalid. That leads me to think the answer to your question is "yes", though I'm not 100% on it.
5) The question doesn't really make sense. There aren't any SegWit transactions before SegWit is activated. Also, "soft forking backwards" is called "hard forking". You can soft-fork the blocksize limit to make it smaller, but to make it bigger again requires a hard fork. If miners decide to stop enforcing the SegWit rules after SegWit has activated, they are no longer mining Bitcoin blocks, and have hard-forked an altcoin. Exchanges and other economically significant nodes would continue enforcing the SegWit rules and so would reject the miners' invalid blocks.
6) The biggest issue I see is the one you raised in point 3. SegWit raises the amount of data that needs to be received, sent, validated, and stored by every full validating node. That is a centralizing pressure, as it becomes more inconvenient and costly to run such a node, meaning less people will bother doing so. But as I say, that's the compromise that Core made in an attempt to placate the "muh bigger blox" crowd.

Not to me.
As it stands, Core has a limit of 1 MB per block, and XT has code built in to raise the limit to 8192 MB per block. So they have different bandwidth requirements over time.

You could. It's likely that the price will drop significantly if the chain splits. There will be separate markets (ie. separate prices) for the two chains, and the sum of the prices of the two coins will be less than the current price, at least at first, and probably for a long time after as well.

BCC doesn't exist yet. But you can deposit your x BTC to ViaBTC and ask them to split it into x BCC tokens and x frozen future BTC tokens. You can then sell your BCC tokens to whatever sucker you can find to buy them (on the exchange) for real BTC, which you can then immediately withdraw.
After the fork, the BCC tokens turn into real BCC, and the frozen future BTC tokens turn into (post fork, unsplittable) BTC.
So you can effectively sell BCC on the exchange now, even though they don't yet exist. But it requires trusting the exchange to eventually let you have your BTC back.

No, if you currently own BTC you have a private key which lets you spend it.
After the fork that same private key will work on both chains. You may choose never to use it on one chain or the other, but you will still automatically own those coins due to the fact that you have the private key which control them.

I'm sure you have better things to do with your time than feeding the xtrolls.
@_date: 2016-05-18 20:08:01
Here's a rough-and-ready explanation. Let me know if you need anything explained differently:
First off, suppose you and I regularly send each other BTC. Currently every time we make a payment we have to pay a transaction fee to get the payment onto the blockchain.
Instead we could make a 2-of-2 multisig address using one private key from each of us. Any coins sent to that address cannot be spent unless we both agree by signing a transaction.
So we both send 1 BTC each to the new 2-of-2 address, I make a transaction (A) saying "pay 1 BTC to dooglus and 1 BTC to llama", I sign it, and send it to you. You sign it, and send it back to me. If you wanted to, you could broadcast it. Then we'd both get our 1 BTC back. But you don't. You hold onto it.
Then when I want to pay you 0.1 BTC I make a new transaction (B) saying "send 0.9 BTC to dooglus and 1.1 to llama", I sign it, and send it to you.
We keep on like this, sending and signing transactions, but not broadcasting them. It's like when you have a tab with a buddy. You're just remembering how much you owe each other, cancelling out debts, and not actually exchanging any cash until one of you asks for it.
This is called a 'payment channel', and LN is made up of lots of them. If there's a channel between P and Q, and between Q and R then P can pay R using Q as a middleman: P -&gt; Q -&gt; R. Both channels adjust the split of the coins between them, but don't need to put anything on the blockchain yet.
It's more complicated than that, because we need a way of revoking old transactions. If we start of at 1 BTC each, then I pay you 0.1 BTC (so I have 0.9 and you have 1.1) then you pay me 0.1 BTC (so we're back at 1 each), I need for you not to be able to broadcast the old transaction in which you get 1.1 BTC.

Don't they know that BIP91 has already locked in and activated, meaning that it is already mandatory to signal for SegWit (BIP141), and that therefore the UASF (which involves orphaning blocks which don't signal for SegWit (BIP141) is indistinguishable from the current situation?
People may run the UASF code, but if miners stick to their signalled intentions of following BIP91 the UASF will make no difference.

That's brilliant. Bitcoin mining is just like making a very hard basketball shot while blindfolded. There's no skill in it, it's just a matter of trying millions of times until it goes in. When it does you send everyone a video of it happening and you get to make a block and get paid for it.
Not because long-distance basketball shots are worth anything, but simply because they're hard to do.
People buy expensive mining equipment which helps them mine faster. That's equivalent to employing a whole bunch of people to throw balls at the hoop. More tries means more chance of success.

If you attempt to upgrade the protocol by doing a hard fork without 100% support, you end up creating a new chain with its own tokens rather than upgrading the existing chain.


Exactly. We used to have a single ETH coin, now we have two incompatible ones. That's an example of how hard forks don't work as an upgrade mechanism, but instead create a new altcoin.


But BIP91 is a soft fork, not a hard fork.


Hard forks are fine if you can get 100% support for them. I don't think Core's schedule has any contentious hard forks in it.


I'm not so clear on this, but I don't think that's the case. SegWit allows for changes to the scripting language via soft fork.

Miners can steal SegWit outputs in the same way they can steal MultiSig outputs.
Neither SegWit nor MultiSig were in the original version of Bitcoin. Both were added as soft forks. Both are "anyone can spend" (though you do need to know the script to spend a MultiSig output) outputs if everyone stops validating the new rules.

If it's an overwhelming majority then the old chain would die, and we'd have a non-contentious hard fork. This happened once, when a bug was discovered after Mike Hearne made an incompatible change to the Bitcoin Core source code, switching from the Berkeley database to LevelDB. Everyone agreed to hard fork to fix the bug, and the old chain died off.
If it wasn't an overwhelming majority, you'd end up with a new altcoin chain (like what happened with the Bcash fork). The new chain isn't Bitcoin, it's a new altcoin since its blocks aren't valid under the Bitcoin rules.


Yes. When bcash forked, they realized that there wasn't much support for it, and that they wouldn't be able to get enough miners mining it, so they changed the difficulty rules. They implemented something they called "emergency difficulty adjustment", which said something like "if less than 6 blocks were mined in the last 12 hours then reduce the difficulty by 20%". The rule triggered many times, dropping the difficulty significantly. Once that had happened, miners started mining it again resulting in hundreds of blocks being mined per hour for a while at low difficulty. Those blocks had very little proof of work behind them - enough to satisfy the bcash rules, but not enough to satisfy the Bitcoin rule about how much proof of work is required.

SegWit fixes transaction malleability, which allows the reliable chaining of unconfirmed transactions, which makes it a lot easier and safer to use bidirectional off-chain payment channels.
Such payment channels are capable of processing thousands of transactions per second while only taking space on the blockchain when they are opened and closed.
That is the way Bitcoin will scale in the future: not by arbitrarily increasing the blocksize limit for small capacity gains at great expense, but by using trustless off-chain solutions. Activating SegWit represents progress towards that scaling solution.

A, B, and C put in 5, 6, and 7 respectively.
A gets out 5
B gets out 5 + 1 change
C gets out 5 + 2 change
You can work out that C's input of 7 belongs to the same person as the change of 2, but you can't work out which of the three identically sized (5) outputs belongs to who.
Here's a real example:
You can see the 250 and 300 BTC inputs and their corresponding change outputs, but there are ten identical looking 0.1 outputs. You can't tell which of those 0.1 outputs is owned by the 300 BTC wallet.

Does Armory work if you don't have a full node installed for it to talk to? I'm guessing you don't list Bitcoin Core because it takes too long to sync the blockchain.


That doesn't sound "completely offline" if you have to put it online every time you want to use it. I keep seeing people referring to their hardware wallets as being "cold storage" and "completely offline", but then they think nothing of plugging this "cold storage" into their virus-ridden Windows box. What is the disconnect here? Are they trusting that the hardware wallet's fireware is perfectly bug free and never leaks their private keys?


You also need to trust the software that creates the paper wallet, and the operating system on which you run that software. Also the ink, I guess.

Blocks provide immutable storage of your data forever, for a one-off low price, whereas the expense of storing that data is spread over thousands of full nodes forever. Of course blocks will fill up. Space on the blockchain is an incredible deal. Full blocks aren't a problem, it's inevitable.


We don't need solutions, since we don't have a problem. I have made 3 transactions in the last few days. None of them paid more than 3 cents in transaction fees, and the slowest of the three took 14 minutes to confirm. One of them confirmed in less than 5 minutes. This is while an attack on the network designed to 'prove' that we need to increase the blocksize limit is in progress.


Fees are the mechanism by which transactions are prioritized. It's cheap and easy to get your transaction into the blockchain. You only need to pay a little more than the attacker is paying. If the blocks were full of people who actually wanted to use Bitcoin that could be seen as a problem but a lot of the transactions are just noise, designed to bloat the blockchain.


I've seen people complain about the discounted fees for signature data. The point of it is that it makes it cheap to spend old outputs and relatively expensive to create new outputs. The intended outcome is that the size of the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set is reduced, which is a good thing since full nodes need to keep the UTXO highly available to validate incoming transactions.




First we would need to agree that there is a bug that needs fixing. I'm not sure that has happened yet.

The attack assumes there are no full nodes, only miners. I will always be validating every transaction. If a miner mines an invalid block, you'll know about it.
Exchanges will also be running full nodes, and validating every transaction. If a miner attempts to steal a SegWit output, where are they going to be able to sell their stolen coins? They would need to find an exchange that is willing to take their coins "on trust" and not validate the transaction. Even if they try to sell them OTC they'd still need to find someone stupid enough not to check the signature first.
In short, it's not going to happen.

A hard fork is when a rule is relaxed. (Like if we say transactions are OK if they reference txids the old way OR the new way).
A soft fork is when a rule is tightened. (Like if we say we will only accept blocks which signal for segwit, in addition to satisfying all the other existing rules).
I don't know what it would mean for a fork to be hard for some people and soft for others.

You're not only trusting BreadWallet itself, but the OS it runs under.

The Bitcoin protocol itself has a consensus rule that all complaint Bitcoin clients enforce.
The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks (which should take about 2 weeks). If the last 2016 blocks took more than 10 minutes each to find on average the difficulty goes up proportional to how much too long they took (but never by more than a factor of 4), and if they took less than 10 minutes on average it goes down (likewise - proportional, but never more than a factor of 4). All the clients know this rule, so they all can calculate what the target is right now, and all agree on it.

Your local client knows nothing about the blockchain. When you enter your 24 word seed into Mycelium your client needs to figure out what unspent outputs exist on the blockchain.
Your client could generate each of your addresses in turn and ask the Mycelium server "is there anything at this address?" over and over. Or it could just send the xpub to the server and ask "what outputs exist for that xpub?". The latter is much more efficient. And even if the first method was used, their server would be pretty safe to assume that all the addresses you request information about are owned by yourself anyway.

It sounds like you made two transactions and are surprised that two transactions are made.
In order for other people not to accidentally make two transactions they need to make sure they only make a single transaction.
It seems the root problem here is that you don't understand the tech you're using. Once you have signed and broadcast a transaction, it is out of your hands. Whether or not the Trezor shows the transaction on its list is irrelevant. Thousands of people now have a copy of the transaction and can confirm it at any point in the future, so long as you haven't double spent any of its inputs. So when you see it vanish from your UI, that means nothing. People still have a copy of it.
Edit: step 4 is where you went wrong. Transactions cannot be 'cancelled'. Who would cancel them? Once you've signed and published a transaction you can't take that back. The closest thing to cancelling a transaction is to double-spend it.

As I understand it, Mycelium for Apple was quite a different program than Mycelium for Android, never really worked very well, and has been retired.
There are plans for a new Mycelium which will work the same on both platforms and will work with any Bitcore server rather than relying on a proprietary Mycelium backup like the Android version currently does.
So I guess for now Mycelium isn't available for Apple devices, but it will be again at some point in the future.
Do you have a 12 word seed? Could it be that you wrote one of the words down incorrectly? I can take a look at it if you like and see if I can find the error.

The question was about the bandwidth requirements of XT compared to Core. Core's blocks are limited to 1 MB. XT's are not. That makes the bandwidth requirements different.




My statement about Core's bandwidth requirements said nothing about my own Internet connection, but for what it's worth:
I have a data cap of 60 GB per month (up + down). I don't know where that puts me in comparison to the global average but that's not relevant to the point I made. My ISP (the only one available where I live) currently increased their maximum monthly cap from 40 GB to 60 GB.
That 60 GB per month is enough to allow me to download each block once and upload it to 14 peers (assuming each block is 1 MB, that I am the only user of the connection, and that Bitcoin blocks are the only kind of data I use the connection for).
Increase the average block size to 8 MB and that 14 drops to less than 2, and I can no longer run a useful node.

I tested this assertion by attempting to compress (using `bzip2`) the `blkNNNNN.dat` files in my full node. I have 930 of them, each 128 MB in size. I compressed every 100th such file and found that the oldest blocks compressed the best:
    blk00000.dat 134202696 =&gt;  97285131 27.50%
    blk00100.dat 134160473 =&gt; 110210903 17.85%
    blk00200.dat 133972400 =&gt; 105692152 21.10%
    blk00300.dat 133525615 =&gt;  87230467 34.67%
    blk00400.dat 133584966 =&gt; 108956936 18.43%
    blk00500.dat 134081603 =&gt; 108874021 18.80%
    blk00600.dat 133810021 =&gt; 109144074 18.43%
    blk00700.dat 133815611 =&gt; 110538244 17.39%
    blk00800.dat 133661949 =&gt; 110501134 17.32%
    blk00900.dat 133409853 =&gt; 110486093 17.18%
I would guess that an explanation for this is that the oldest blocks are mostly empty, and so the ratio of uncompressible hashes to very compressible coinbases is lower in old blocks.
The least compressible block file I found still reduced by over 17% when I compressed it.

Not true.


How are you deciding what the economic majority supports? I don't care about loud social voices. I care about breaking the miners' blockade.


You have it backwards. The miners either follow the rules or switch to an altcoin.


Kids don't set the rules either. The economic majority sets the rules. Miners enforce the rules or they're not mining Bitcoin.


Barry helped us get SegWit supported by the miners. The same as BIP148 would have. The result is the same.


The miners would have switched to the UASF chain when they saw how the market reacted. Most miners are rational and will mine whatever makes them the best return.




I'm not the one throwing a tantrum. I'm quite calm.


Core devs aren't all-powerful. They provide code and you can run it if you like. There was no support for Mike H's 8 GB blocksize limit, or any of the other crazy proposals from the big block crowd. There's no need for a hard fork when a soft fork is sufficient for the time being.


We'll see. I think most of the miners are rational and will work out the incentives for themselves.


You think the Core developers are heroes of mine? They're not. I understand that you prefer to increase the blocksize limit than to scale in more intelligent ways. I disagree. I don't think that means I'm not educated on the matters at hand.
@_date: 2017-07-23 07:48:09
1. It isn't possible to increase the blocksize limit without a hard fork. A hard fork requires 100% of the nodes to upgrade. This is hard if not impossible to achieve.
2. Bigger blocks result in more centralization.
3. We don't need bigger blocks yet. The majority of recent transactions were spam created by people pushing for bigger blocks. SegWit will allow us to have thousands of transactions per second happening offchain. There's no need to have every tiny transaction go onto the chain when better solutions exist.
In other words: we can't do it, we don't want to do it, and we don't need to do it.

BCH's spec says that its transactions will be incompatible with real BTC transactions (requiring a new type of signature - `SIG_FORK` or some such). Last time I checked this was mentioned in their spec but it wasn't in the code. Maybe that has changed already.
Their site says:


If BCH transactions have to be signed the new way, and BTC transactions have to *not* be signed in the new way, replay will be impossible in either direction.
It's a shame they are rushing things and not giving anyone time to review their code or design, or work on alternative implementations, but it is what it is.
Edit: [here is a commit]( which appears to make Bitcoin ABC reject transactions which aren't signed "the new way" (which turns out to be called `SIGHASH_FORKID` - I was close-ish) after the fork.
Edit2: check out the "reassuring" comments:

I think people are misunderstanding this.
The scam is that the linked video links to a github repository which links to an executable which is malware, not that the linked software can be used by scammers to create fake transactions. The linked software itself *is* the scam.
Why would blockchain.info and electrum accept a transaction which creates a million Bitcoins out of nowhere. Does neither check the inputs of the transaction and/or the signatures? Much more likely is that the video is faked, and intended purely to get naive would-be scammers to download some malware.

So breadwallet doesn't protect me from hard forks any more than any other wallet?
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:18:18


I thought at first that that couldn't be the case, since of the 4 transactions which showed up only the oldest was a credit. The other 3 were spends, and the single credit was *smaller* than my current balance. However the 3 spends left significant change and so you're right. The 4 transactions which showed up were exactly those with unspent outputs and their sum is the same as my balance at the time.
Another strange thing I notice:
I'm looking at my transaction list. It seems to be complete.
I go to the 'accounts' tab, select the wallet I'm already using, click done, go back to the transaction list, and it's still there and complete, as expected.
Then I go to the 'accounts' tab, select the same wallet again, view the unspent outputs, hit back, done, then go to the transaction list and it's blank. It takes 5 or 10 seconds to fill in, as if it is being re-downloaded from the server.
Why should viewing the unspent output list cause the transaction list to be lost? This appears to be repeatable and is inconvenient especially since I live in an area where Internet access is patchy at best. I'd like to be able to always have my transaction list cached and never forgotten.
If I was actually switching between wallets then I can see that maybe you don't want to save the data for inactive wallets and would rather re-fetch it from the server each time, but I'm not doing that - I'm selecting the same wallet every time, and the local cache is only wiped if I view the unspent output list.

They can't know which ones will be worth anything until after the chain forks, and by then it could be too late. It turns out in this case that replay protection might mean that user altcoins are safe, if the replay protection code actually works.

Nonsense. If Dogecoin achieves more hash power and a higher price than Bitcoin, is that Bitcoin?

Can BIP141 lock in this period, or do we need to wait for the next one?
Edit: to answer my own question, it cannot lock in this period.
 says:






So even if every one of the remaining 691 blocks signals for BIP141 we only end up with 749+691 = 1440 blocks signalling, or around 71% - nowhere near the 95% needed.
So we need to wait for the next period to start (takes 4 or 5 days), then it takes another 2 weeks to lock in, and then another 2 weeks to activate. So we're looking at around 32 days from now for segwit to activate, right? (Assuming difficulty periods last 14 days each, which is maybe an over estimate).

You can say "nope" all you like, but you still have it wrong. If old clients aren't able to receive new transactions then it isn't a soft fork.
Old clients will not be able to receive or understand the segregated witness part of segwit transactions, but they will still be able to receive the transactions. They will see segwit transactions as having "Anyone-Can-Spend" outputs. They can even try spending some of those outputs but they will find that the majority chain doesn't accept such transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:14:07
Yes. Once on each chain.
I would recommend transferring out the BTC first since your BTC wallet likely won't steal your coins. To transfer out the BCC you'll need to scan the paper wallet privkey with a BCC wallet, and who knows how trustworthy they will be. If you didn't already move out your BTC then BCC wallet could take them.

No, compound interest grows your capital exponentially whereas simple interest grows it linearly. The longer you compound for, the greater the rate of growth. You can't give a range like 25-50% for how much better compound interest is than simple interest. They aren't comparable. Exponential growth is vastly different than linear growth.


Let me know which step you disagree with:
1. 3.5% interest per day is the same as multiplying by 1.035
2. 3.5% interest per day over 365 days is the same as multiplying by 1.035^365
3. 1.035^365 = 283940.7168
4. so 3.5% interest per day over 365 days is the same as multiplying by 283,940.7168
5. That is the same as 28,394,071.68%
By the way, compounding every minute would give the same result if the daily rate is 3.5%.

There is a limit of 8 outgoing connections and 125 total connections.
If you want more than 8 total connections you need to be able to accept connections from peers outside your router's LAN. That means having your router forward connection attempts to you.
You can bypass the hardcoded limit of 8 outbound connections by editing `net.h`, here, though I wouldn't recommend it for the health of the network. Better would be to configure port forwarding on your router so that your node is connectable and in doing so help out the Bitcoin p2p network:

I don't think he's a retard. He just doesn't understand Bitcoin or money very well.
I tried to leave a comment on his video to help him understand but it doesn't appear to have posted. Maybe there's a length limit?
I tried to write:
Some of my responses to your video, ordered by time:


Well, it's been around for 7 years already. It's not very new any more.


Anyone telling you that doesn't know what they're talking about. The entire blockchain is public, so all transactions are public. Maybe they meant to say it's pseudonymous, meaning that it's hard to tie transactions to real identities.


Do you have any specific questions about it? Maybe I can help explain it.


Lots of businesses already adopted it. The price of Bitcoin is going to remain volatile for a long time yet. If it is ever widely used the price will need to be much higher than it currently is. 7 years ago the price was zero. You can't go from zero to "lots" without some bumps along the way. It's too volatile for most people to consider it an investment right now. Those who are brave enough to take a risk could make a very good return. And those who don't like the volatility should probably stay away for now.


Personally, I bought some Bitcoin when I first heard about it because the tech itself is amazing. Never before has there been any way of individuals holding money that they can spend on the Internet without requiring the permission of a third party. I can send money from my Bitcoin address to yours and nobody can stop me. Nobody can shut my account down (like PayPal tend to do) or tell me that I'm not allowed to send money to you (because you're suspected of some crime or other). Those coins that I bought for 40 cents each are now worth over $400 each. That's a 1000x increase. Of course I didn't know the price was going to go up. It could have gone down to almost nothing over the next few months, but it didn't. I took a risk on Bitcoin after looking at the code and working to understand how it works. Once I saw how it works, how it's so robust against attack, I figured it was worth putting some money into. So the $25 I risked is now worth $25k. You can say I gambled and got lucky, but it seemed like a good idea to me at the time.


Most Businesses that accept Bitcoin use a payment processor that allows them to convert any percentage of the Bitcoins they receive into their own local government currency. So if they want US dollars, that's what they get. The price in Bitcoin is calculated using the spot price right then, so the company gets exactly the right amount of dollars. There's no risk to the business if they don't want any Bitcoin price exposure.


Well, the purchasing power of the dollar is steadily decreasing. A dollar today has 5% of the purchasing power of a dollar 100 years ago. New dollars are being created at ever increasing speeds. A Bitcoin I earned 5 years ago is still worth 1 Bitcoin. Only now instead of being able to buy a pizza with it, today I can buy a chainsaw with it. Its purchasing power has gone up. That's why I accept Bitcoin rather than dollars whenever possible.


That's not true. When I was a kid I could buy a chocolate bar for 20 cents. Now the same thing costs me a dollar. I can buy 5 times less chocolate with my dollars than I used to be able to. The fact that you can also buy less chocolate than you used to be able to is no consolation to me. The inflation has reduced my purchasing power whether or not it also affected yours. If you're living paycheck to paycheck then I guess inflation isn't a problem, so long as your salary keeps up with inflation. But what if you're trying to save for the future? Inflation eats away at your savings, so you're betting off just buying all the chocolate you can afford each day.


True. But you're also gambling by holding any other asset. Government currencies go up and down relative to each other. In the last couple of years the Canadian dollar has lost around 25% of its value relative to the American dollar. Would you say that people with their savings denominated in Canadian dollars were "gambling"? Most sure don't feel like it, yet they've still "lost". Holding Government currencies is a losing proposition long term. They always end up worthless. So what are you going to put your money into that isn't a gamble? The stock market? That's a gamble too. Precious metals? They also go up and down in price. Whatever you pick you can't be sure that you're going to maintain your purchasing power. It just so happens that over the last 2 years my Bitcoin assets have performed better than my Canadian dollar assets. It could have been the other way around too, but there's no way of knowing in advance. Diversification is key.


That doesn't happen for over 100 years, so it's not an immediate concern. But the block reward does halve every 4 years. In addition to the 25 (soon to be 12.5) Bitcoins per block, miners also get all the transaction fees for the transactions they include in a block. The idea is that transaction fees will replace the block reward in incentivizing miners to keep on mining.


Well, the difficulty of mining is automatically adjusted by the Bitcoin protocol such that there is just the right amount of mining going on. If some miners stop mining, blocks will start taking too long to be found, and so the difficulty will automatically be adjusted to make it easier for the remaining miners, reducing their price per block. Your concern reminds me of the joke "nobody goes there any more because it's too busy".


You'll get no argument from me there.


I care about it because it gives me back control over my money. It can store it as securely as I like, I can spend it however I like, and I don't have to trust any third party to store it or to help me transact in it. Decentralization is important in that it makes that control possible. If Bitcoin was run from a centralized server then it would be trivial for governments to shut it down; it would have a single point of failure.


Because the government controlled currency is constantly being inflated, robbing savers of their value. Because government controlled currency can't be sent instantly over the Internet without permission of a third party. Because I can.


Then why make a video about it?


I'm not going crazy about it. I've worked for Bitcoin, I hold some, and I use it regularly when I need to buy things online. The massive historical price increases have been a nice bonus but I would be using it even if they hadn't happened.

Nobody is saying LN is magic. It will help Bitcoin scale in a sustainable way however without requiring everyone to keep a copy of everyone else's transactions forever.
I don't think there is any urgency to increase the blocksize limit. Bitcoin is working, you can easily get your transactions into a block (if you don't make silly mistakes like trying to spend unconfirmed outputs and pay a reasonable fee). Sometimes the blocks are filled by spammers, but that would be the case if the blocksize limit was doubled too.

@_date: 2016-05-18 21:37:54
Right. We keep adjusting the balances back and forth with these signed-but-not-broadcast transactions until one of us wants to close the channel by broadcasting the final transaction. At that point the coins leave the 2-of-2 address and get split between us in the way that we most recently agreed, and everyone gets to see it on the blockchain.
From an outsider's point of view they will see the 2-of-2 address being funded, and then, possibly years later, they will see it being all spent at once, split between two addresses.

If he refuses to acknowledge the SegWit rules, that's a soft fork. He's staying with the current rules, and the SegWit chain is enforcing a new stricter set of rules.

At least until the difficulty adjusts.
Did you see that BitcoinCash has code that automatically adjusts the difficulty, multiplying the target by 1.25 (ie. multiplying the difficulty by 0.8) for each block if the previous 6 blocks took more than 12 hours to mine? That means that after the first day, it will be relatively easy to mine BCC blocks if it is really unpopular. But that code only kicks in if it is really unpopular. :)

Yeah, not really. It is possible for two different forks of the git repository to agree on the consensus rules, and so not to fork the blockchain. And it is also possible for two branches within a single git repository to disagree on the consensus rules, and so to fork the blockchain.
There's little correspondence between git forks and blockchain forks.
As for which client is "the reference client", that really depends who you ask. There's nobody in charge of Bitcoin to say which is "the reference client". That's why the Bitcoin Core project stopped referring to their offering as "the reference client" and started calling it "Bitcoin Core".

You are confusing blockchain forks (which can be 'hard' or 'soft') with git repository forks (which are a regular occurrance; every Bitcoin developer has their own fork of the repository).
Whether a blockchain fork is hard (requiring everyone to update their client or be left on an incompatible fork) or soft is unrelated to which github account anyone is using.

Assuming the transaction shown is you withdrawing from an exchange, the fee of 0.0013025 BTC was paid by the exchange to the miners. The exchange likely charged you a standard round number fee, which could have been more or less than the fee paid to the miners.
The spent transaction is the change output, which was never yours.
Like when you buy a $3.50 item with a $5 bill, the store gives you $1.50 back in change. If you later spend that $1.50 in a different store, the first store doesn't post on reddit asking why the $1.50 has been spent. It's your change, and you're free to spend it where you like.

When ETH forked into ETC and ETH someone was running a bot that was reading the transactions on each network and rebroadcasting them on the other network. Since there was no replay protection this ended up with the transactions confirming on both chains.
BCH's spec was recently updated to say that it will have replay protection. I don't see how they will have time to implement and test it in time for their rushed hard fork, so I wouldn't assume that the replay protection will actually exist and work properly. But it might.

I use an offline laptop which is never connected to the Internet.


No. I create a transaction on an online machine and sign it on an offline machine. No sweeping is involved.


That depends on which software you're using to create a paper wallet. If I use something I developed myself and never published then it's clearly harder to compromise than something developed in public and distributed in binary form. I don't use paper wallets anyway.
I simply prefer to keep my coins offline. Connecting a device which holds my private key to the public Internet every time I want to spend seems like an unnecessary risk to me since I need to trust that the firmware on that device isn't exploitable.

Your "therefore" doesn't follow; the interests of the miners aren't very well aligned with the interests of Bitcoin as a whole. That's the problem.
The big miners do best by refusing to allow a transaction malleability to activate, since allowing it would prevent them from profiting from ASICBOOST.
Bitcoin as a whole does best by fixing transaction malleability, since that allows users to build chains of unconfirmed transactions, opening the way for massive offchain scaling and relieving the pressure on block space without dangerously increasing the rate of blockchain size growth.

Is your argument that the user activated **soft** fork is a **hard** fork?
UASF had its desired effect. Everyone is signalling for SegWit now. No difficulty lowering and/or proof of work change required.
Miners saw the UASF coming and decided to signal for SegWit in advance to save face. Now they can maintain their pretense that they are in charge and that the UASF was ineffective. Nobody's buying it.

Neither would the word "Bitcoin", yet.
Eventually both "Bitcoin" and "hodl" would be easy to google to find the meaning of.
"Bitcoin" though is ambiguous. It could be a warning from your future self to avoid putting your savings into a bad tech, or it could be advice to do exactly that.
"Hodl" on the other hand is clear, once you've found the post that first coined the word. It's a simple concise way of saying "buy and hold bitcoins". If I'm only allowed to send one word back, and it isn't allowed to be a long made up word like "HoldBitcoinUntil2600USD" then I think "hodl" is a good choice, if that even counts as a word itself.
Of course if everyone is sending words back to themselves they're going to be changing the future. I'd be buying up all the sub dollar BTC I can get my hands on in 2009, so the 10k BTC pizza will never happen and there's no reason to think BTC will reach 2600 USD this year at all.

Then it is confirmed, and the other one isn't and will never be confirmed.


Labelled where? By whom?
If it's just blockchain.info or some site like that labelling them as double-spent then you can safely ignore that. I think they'll forget about the unconfirmed transaction eventually.
If it's your Bitcoin Core wallet, then you can ask it to delete the unconfirmed double-spend by running the wallet with the -zapwallettxes flag:
    -zapwallettxes=&lt;mode&gt;
         Delete all wallet transactions and only recover those parts of the
         blockchain through -rescan on startup (1 = keep tx meta data e.g.

Once you have made a backup of your 12 word seed, and tested that you can recover your wallet on a different computer using nothing but those 12 words you might want to delete all trace of your wallet from your computer(s) so you don't lose your coins if your computer is hacked. Just keep the 12 word seed somewhere safe (preferably in multiple places, in case of fire - safe means "safe from prying eyes" as well as "safe from destruction" - you want to make sure that you will always have access to the words, and also that nobody you can't trust has access to them) and you'll have access to your coins when you need it.

The mempool is the pool of all transactions awaiting confirmation.

Now that we have the NYA, they have stopped.

It is now possible to get transactions into blocks paying just 1 satoshi per byte, even as people scramble to get their coins off exchanges in preparation for Bitcoin Crash (or whatever this new failed hardfork is called), showing yet again that we don't need bigger blocks even before many people are using payment channels.

Just keep mining on the longest chain, rather than rejecting non-segwit-signalling blocks. UASF needs 15% of the hashrate to actively enforce BIP148, not just to signal for segwit.

That doesn't work either. There's nothing to stop legacy miners from pulling transactions from BIP148 blocks and including them in their legacy blocks.
Replay protection looks like a difficult problem to solve, especially if the legacy chain is reorged to the BIP148 chain repeatedly. Users will have to re-separate their outputs each time the reorg happens, because there will be a new chain split each time.

You missed this bit:


@_date: 2017-07-06 07:25:19
Each individual check is pretty fast. Your phone can probably do a million checks per second. What makes it hard is that for each nonce we test we get a number in the range roughly 0 to (1 followed by 77 zeroes), and to be successful we currently need the hash to be less than the current target, which is roughly (4 followed by 55 zeroes). That means that there is a one in (3 followed by 21 zeroes) chance of any random nonce being successful, and so globally the miners need to test about that many nonces on average to find each block. They can do that in about 10 minutes, which is quite amazing.
Edit: also, it turns out that the nonce can only have around 4 billion different values, which is nowhere near enough to stand a chance of solving a block, and so miners have to modify something else in the block as well, in order to have enough things to test. They can play about with the timestamp on the block a little, or they can tinker with the coinbase transaction itself, putting an "extraNonce" in there, giving them more bits to play with.

You can use Bitcoin Core to make a conflicting transaction which spends the same utxos with a higher fee, and there's some chance a miner will mine the higher fee transaction first.

Each block contains the hash of the previous block (this is how blocks form a 'chain'; each block references its parent). So whenever any miner finds a new block everyone has to stop what they're working on and start working on a block which contains the new blocks hash instead of the previous block's hash. This is the case whether or not the new block includes a transaction the other miner was also planning to include in his block.
Everyone also needs to remove all mined transactions from their copy of the mempool and build a new candidate block from the remaining transactions in their mempool at that time.

If that's what the article says then the article is wrong. Vays' transaction confirmed because the miner deliberately prioritized it. At the time there were many transactions paying higher fees. Here's an annotated chart of the mempool:
The transaction would have confirmed an hour later than it did if the miner hadn't given it special treatment. Either way it wouldn't have confirmed before midnight local time and so technically Roger wins the bet. He's still wrong about low fee transactions taking weeks to confirm, which was the point Tone was objecting to.
[This page]( shows the transactions in that block in order of increasing fee per byte. There are only 3 transactions paying 1 sat/vB or less. The coinbase (which pays nothing), Tone's, and a third which is respent in the same block with a much bigger fee, ie. "child pays for parent".

Bitcoin is multiple layers. Most transactions already happen offchain today. They're not very secure and require trust in third parties. Second layer solutions will make them trustless and almost instantaneous. These second layer solutions are also Bitcoin, not just the settlement layer.
That's what Roger doesn't seem to understand.

I don't see that as a problem. "Undecidable" means that you can't tell what a contact will do without actually running it. You can't even tell if it will run in finite time or not. But since people pay real value to run contact code that's not a problem. If the code doesn't terminate before the transaction fee is all spent, the miner still gets the fee.
A much bigger problem is that you can no longer trust that your contract won't be broken because "the community" decides to do so. They have already demonstrated that the whole "code is law" smart contract selling point is nothing but bullshit and that they are willing to manually intervene when it affects their bottom line.

No, you misunderstand.
"Incoming" vs. "outgoing" is about how the connection was initiated, ie. who connected to who. Once connected, traffic will flow in both directions, irrespective of who initiated the connection.
The "8" that people see is the limit on outgoing connections. Your node will not initiate connections to more than 8 peers at a time.
If you have your node set to listen for incoming connections, you can get up to the default maximum of 125 total connections.
This is why people talk about opening ports. If your node isn't connectable from outside your router's LAN you won't be seeing any incoming connections and will be limited to 8 outgoing connections.
    /** The maximum number of peer connections to maintain. */
    static const unsigned int DEFAULT_MAX_PEER_CONNECTIONS = 125;
    /** Maximum number of automatic outgoing nodes */

I find the gateway and the widget both give me addresses from my wallet.
Note that the "m/0/n" derivation they talk about is relative to the xpub key you provide, which is already at the m/44'/0'/n' level (where n is the account number - 0 for the 1st one you create, 1 for the 2nd, etc.). You probably only have a single mycelium seed, but get different xpub keys for each account, since each has a different n in its m/44'/0'/n' derivation.

I thought its built-in checksum discouraged use as a brainwallet. If I randomly pick 12 words from the BIP39 wordlist I have a 1 in 16 chance of the checksum being correct. If I pick 24 words that drops to 1 in 256.
Bitcoin itself doesn't discourage misuse as a brainwallet. I can use sha256('secret') as my private key.

Each time a Bitcoin miner creates a new block he is paid a reward for the work it took to create the block. For the first 4 years (until 2012) the reward was 50 BTC per block. For the next 4 years (until about a week from now) the reward was 25 BTC per block. In about a week the reward will halve again to 12.5 BTC per block, and it will keep halving every 4 years going forward.
The halving period isn't really 4 years, but is in fact 210,000 blocks. Since we get a new block about every 10 minutes, 210,000 blocks take:
 `210000 / 6 / 24 / 365.25 = 3.9927` years.
So it's pretty close to 4 years.
There are people who think that since the rate of creation of new Bitcoins is about to be cut in half, the price should be about to double. There are other people who argue that since the impending halving of new supply is already known about that it must already be priced in. The truth is probably somewhere between the two.

Ehh... not quite.
It was an altcoin with a brand new chain, and with coins seeded in fixed (4.6xxx CLAM) amounts to Bitcoin, Litecoin and Doge private keys.
It used the same key pairs as the BTC, LTC, and DOGE chains, but with a different version byte in the base58 address encoding, so the addresses start with an `x` instead of a `1`, `L`, or `D`. There's no "claiming" mechanism - if you know the privkey for a funded BTC, LTC, or DOGE address, you automatically own the corresponding CLAMs.

Yes. From their point of view they didn't fork off, we did. BCH and BTC have identical blockchains up to the fork point. I don't know what you mean by 'refreshed' if that matters. Each block only references the previous block, not the thousands that came before it.

This does not even remotely resemble the correct number of possible inputs, which is 2^2^(64)-1
This should immediately trigger alarm bells in anyone with a rudimentary undergraduate-level understanding of discrete mathematics as the author's "-1" was a little too big and not high enough up in the air.
Just kidding. But if you're going to pick his post apart, do it wright. :)
Edit: it seems I'm wrong, and 2^(2^64)-1 is right after all. I forgot to take all the shorter messages into account.
If the maximum input length was 2^(2)-1 (ie. 3) then there are 8 inputs of length 3, 4 of length 2, 2 of length 1, and 1 of length 0, giving a total of 15 inputs, or 2^(2^2)-1.

I didn't downvote you, but I can try to assess the truthfulness of each of your statements:


It is 100% true that this has been repeatedly stressed on this sub. And it is 100% true that if you don't have exclusive conttrol of your keys then you do not have exclusive control of your coins.


The assumption that Bitcoin is "in" a wallet is false. Wallets contain private keys, not Bitcoin, so the statement doesn't really make any sense. It is true that in order for you to be sure that the key in your wallet gives you exclusive control of some Bitcoins you need an onchain transaction that assigns control of those coins to your key.


Onchain transactions are required, but not for every transaction you make. Payment channels exist, and guarantee you access to your coins without an onchain transaction for every transaction. Thus payment channels are a substitute for some onchain transactions, but not all.
I hope that clears things up.

Bitcoin addresses are the 160 bit RIPE-MD hashes of a public key, base64check encoded. That's what they are. And so there is no address which isn't the encoding of the hash of a public key, by definition of what an address is.
You could make something which looked like a Bitcoin address but which failed the base58check checksum, or possibly even something which passed the checksum but wasn't the hash of any public key, but it wouldn't be a Bitcoin address.

It would look like a random address, but it would be a particular random address, which happens to have the same private key as your dogecoin address.

2FA is a pain to support. People lose their phone all the time. Or factory reset it. Or drop it in the toilet. Or the 2FA app updates itself and somehow loses all its secrets. And no matter how much you encourage them to keep a backup of the 2FA secret very few actually do it.
If an exchange forced its users to use 2FA they would both increase their support load and lose customers to an exchange that was easier to use. It's an unfortunate reality. So the best they can do is offer 2FA and encourage people to use it.

I created a new wallet using my own entropy source, and copied the 12 words into breadwallet. Breadwallet of course had no way of knowing it was a new wallet. I left it running all night by the way, and now it's up to 66.4%. Is it downloading the whole blockchain? I'm had assumed it was an SPV wallet, but taking 9 hours to sync 66.4% seems excessive.


The use case I'm thinking of:
I have my funds in a Trezor. My Trezor breaks. I want to recover my funds. I don't want to buy a new Trezor. I want to be able to enter the 12 words I have written down into breadwallet and continue using my coins. I don't want anyone to vouch for the security of Trezor, I just don't want to lose my coins.
Obviously using the same seed on multiple wallets just increases the chances of losing your coins to an exploit. At some point you need to trust the user. You give them their 12 seed words after all. How do you know they aren't going to "back them up" by emailing themselves a copy of them? You don't refuse to give them the 12 words because you can't vouch for the security of the media they will be backed up on.

You're right. I've fixed it.


I know. I was overestimating the global computing power to show that even if you are very generous with how fast "all the world's computers" are, you still can't get close to cracking a private key in 700 million years. Using a more realistic estimate only makes your 700 million years more wrong.


Where did the 20e13 come from?
For the lottery I think you must have been doing the math wrong. If the odds of winning a single lottery is one in 10^6, the odds of winning two in a row is one in 10^12, and the odds of winning 20 in a row is one in 10^120. The exponential growth in the odds means that very quickly the odds against winning are bigger than anything else, including the odds against generating the same address twice. There are 'only' around 10^77 different private keys after all.

Each one of those has more entropy than a word selected from a fixed dictionary of 2048 words. Even picking 12 random phrases from classic literature and stringing them end to end would give you more entropy than picking 12 words from a 2048 word dictionary. Simply because there are more than 2048 different phrases in classic literature.

@_date: 2019-05-26 01:29:51
You wouldn't have needed additional BTC. Instead of sending $100 to the hacker and $1 to the miners, you would have made a new tx that spent the same $101 but sending $90 to yourself and $11 to the miners. That should have been enough to get them to accept your version. Of course, if the hacker was smart he'd make a new transaction paying $80 to himself and $21 to the miners, and so on until the miners ended up with all of it.

I'm thinking about offering a service to facilitate this. I see people on both sides of the divide looking for a swap.
Would you be interested? I'd take a 1% cut, you'd get 1.98 times your BTC after the fork, and 0 times your BCC. The other party would get 1.98 times his BCC and 0 times his BTC.
So you and a big blocker both send me 1 BTC of pre-fork Bitcoin. After the fork I send you 1.98 BTC, send him 1.98 BCC, and keep 0.02 BTC and 0.02 BCC for myself.
Seems like an easy way for both of you to almost double your holdings in the coin you value while losing only a worthless altcoin.
Right? :)
@_date: 2017-07-23 07:27:45


Something like this:
You split the chain into BTC and BCC. Convince braindead big blockers that BCC is the future and that you are "firing core", etc. They sell their BTC to buy lots of cheap BCC. You buy their BTC up cheap in exchange for your BCC. Then you wait. BCC inevitably fails, becomes worthless. Meanwhile you've increased your BTC stash and they've lost theirs. They're left holding worthless BCC tokens and you're left holding their BTC.

It's only one in a million if each unconfirmed transaction has a 50% chance of never confirming. (2^20 ~= 1 million)


And so would it be fair to say that you are storing the HD seed unencrypted on the main storage where the root account can read it?




That would be opt-out then if it's on by default. I think this option should be moved into the main settings because I certainly don't remember ever seeing it before. Most people will only set their PIN once, and that's at a time when they have very little value in their wallet. Defaulting to allowing it to be reset after a week and never mentioning the option again, not even in the settings page is likely to result in people having that option enabled without realizing. I certainly did until about a minute ago. :)

There are two reasons I don't like Mycelium:
1) It is impossible to get more than one receiving address at a time. If I give my receiving address to person A, I can't get a new one to give to person B until person A pays me. So I end up giving them both the same address and can't tell who paid me what.
2) Mycelium stores your HD seed in the filesystem in plain text. If your phone is stolen the thief only needs to root it to be able to steal your coins. *Edit: a reply to this comment hints that it is hard to root a device without also wiping it, so maybe this isn't so much of an issue.*
I expect breadwallet will solve at least one of these two showstopper bugs, but I don't know for sure. Security seems to be a big deal for the breadwallet guys, so I'm hopeful that at least the 2nd issue isn't an issue for breadwallet.
Edit: according to [this github issue]( breadwallet doesn't support BIP44 and so isn't compatible with Mycelium, Copay, Trezor, etc. That's a shame. I wish there was a standard that all the wallets would follow instead of everyone doing it their own way. Bitcoin Core's 0.13 release will add HD key generation, but as far as I can tell it will be incompatible with every other wallet's HD scheme.
Edit2: After playing with the wallet a little it appears to have the same first issue as Mycelium - I can't get a 2nd receiving address. Presumably the receiving address will change automatically if the 1st one receives coins. And for the 2nd issue, breadwallet only lets me set a 4 digit PIN to protect my coins. Mycelium allows up to 6 digits. I don't like the idea of only a 4 digit PIN preventing total coin loss in the event of the phone being lost.
At some point the various screens started appearing on top of each other too, making messes like this:

It can, in the bank's database.


Suppose A deposits 10 BTC to his Coinbase account. Suppose Coinbase has a 10% reserve requirement. Coinbase can lend 9 BTC to B. B can then use that 9 BTC to buy something from C by internally transferring the 9 BTC he borrowed to C's coinbase account. This is treated as a new deposit, and so 8.1 BTC more can now be loaned, since Coinbase now has deposits of 19 BTC in total. So they lend 8 BTC to D. They now have loaned out 9+8=17 BTC when they only actually have 10 BTC in their Bitcoin wallet.
In that respect Bitcoin is just as fractional as gold. If people are willing to treat the numbers on their Coinbase account as if they are real Bitcoins then fractional reserve banking is possible.

I wondered the same, so I downloaded it to try it. Here are my first impressions of how it compares with Mycelium:
* uses secure enclave to store HD seed - more secure
* connects directly to Bitcoin network (SPV style) - no central server dependency
* very simple interface - easier for noobs
* takes quite a while to 'sync' the first time you run it; I've had it running for half an hour and it's only 50% done
* appears to insist on all input and output values being in "bits" (ie. millionths of bitcoins); if your balance is 10 BTC it shows up as 10,000,000b which is kind of silly - let the users choose which units they want to see
* no multiple account support
* ~~no spending from paper wallets~~ *Edit: apparently you can do this if you have a QR code for the paper wallet*
* no BIP44 support - your 12 word seed from other wallets probably won't work here
* I don't see a way to import xprv HD keys either, so cross-wallet support isn't an option (unless the other wallet uses the same derivation path, like Hive apparently does)
* only allows 4 digit PIN to protect coins
* UI seems [a little buggy]( but it's the first Android release
* very simple interface - limiting for experienced users
* won't give you a new receiving address until the previous one is funded, promoting address reuse and confusion

I don't think I left it in the foreground, no. I know some apps continue running even when in the background. I guess breadwallet doesn't.
Even just allowing import using an xprv key rather than 12 words would be better than the current situation. That way the derivation path doesn't matter - I can give the xprv for whatever path I want. I'd still have issues like having to import each Mycelium account separately (twice each, once for receiving addresses and once for change), and Bitcoin Core's HD xprv still wouldn't work, since they use per-address hardening in their HD derivation.

I wouldn't downvote the OP, but it is rather sensationalizing things. The situation being described seems pretty unlikely to happen.

Maybe you don't understand the difference between hard and soft forks.
A hard fork relaxes the rules. It makes more things legal. Increasing the (non-witness) block size limit from 1 million bytes to 2 million bytes would be a hard fork. Increasing the block reward from 12.5 BTC to 13 BTC would be a hard fork.
A soft fork tightens the rules. It makes less things legal. Reducing the block size limit from 1 million bytes to 500k bytes would be a soft fork. Decreasing the block reward from 12.5 BTC to 12 BTC would be a soft fork. Requiring a new "witness" structure for transactions which are structured in a particular way was a soft fork. Pre-segwit clients would allow you to spend segwit outputs without a signature (the "anyone can spend" issue the big blockers love to go on about). Post-segwit clients tighten the rules to require a valid witness structure. So segwit was a soft fork.
I hope that clears things up for you, so you can stop arguing about it all over other people's threads and pay the 1 BTC you owe for losing your bet.

You can run as many bitcoin-qt instances as you like, but each will need its own:
* data directory
* p2p port
* RPC port
Make a separate directory for each instance, specify `-datadir=&lt;path-to-directory&gt;` for each, and make a `bitcoin.conf` in each data directory with something like:
    port=12001
    rpcport=12002
(but use different port numbers in each file).
Edit: to save downloading everything multiple times you might also want to have only one of your instances be connecting to external peers, and have your other instances connect only to that online instance. Add `connect=127.0.0.1:xxxx` to the `bitcoin.conf` file in each instance's data directory, where `xxxx` is the p2p port of the instance that is syncing with external peers.

I don't think it's possible to get 'extra bits' by iterating through a hashing algorithm a bunch of times. You end up with the same amount of entropy you started with.
What makes a password hashed with scrypt harder to crack than one hashed with sha256 is that scrypt is slower. BIP38's password hashing is slow, BIP39's is very fast. So it's much easier to brute-force a BIP39 password than a BIP38 password.
[Here's recently telling me how bad BIP39 is. I never did understand the checksum part, but the rest makes sense to me.

It's possible that they are already validating the checksum. Doge addresses use the same checksum algorithm as Bitcoin addresses. What they need to do is check the 'version byte' too. That's how you tell Doge addresses apart from Bitcoin addresses. (Or just check that it starts with a '1' or a '3' or a ...).

I'm not particularly attached to BIP39 either. I just want a way of storing my HD seed using a bunch of words rather than a long random hex or base58 string. Since BIP39 seems pretty widely adopted it seems like the natural choice, but maybe it has downsides that I don't understand yet. For now I'll continue using wallets that support BIP39 and keep running Core nodes on servers to support the p2p network.

I just tested this. I entered the (6 digit) PIN wrong 20 times in a row, and nothing bad happened. Then I entered it correctly and it let me in. The 20 guesses were all different.
I have Mycelium set to require a PIN on startup, so that is where I was typing it wrong. If the app is meant to only allow 3 guesses then it isn't working right.

If you send to an address multiple times, you will end up with multiple outputs at that address.
The way to avoid that is to make a single large payment rather than lots of small payments. There's no way to "merge" outputs without creating a transaction to do so.
This is nothing to do with Electrum and everything to do with the fundamentals of how Bitcoin works.
It makes no difference whether you are sending to the same address multiple times, or sending to a different address each time. Either way the outputs won't be merged automatically until you spend them.

At most one, yes. In this case the malleated transaction confirmed, and the transaction whose output he was trying to spend didn't.


Look again.
What really happened is that he sent $23K to himself with zero fee (call it transaction A) and spent the output of transaction A in transaction B.
Transaction A was malleated (call the malleated transaction A'). Transaction A' got confirmed, so transaction A could never confirm, and so transaction B could never confirm.
The ironic part of this is that "bigger blocks" wouldn't have solved the problem, since the problem was a direct result of transaction malleability. The correct solution to his problem would be to use segregated witness which puts an end to transaction malleability.

You need to just make a new transaction which conflicts with the existing one (because you don't want both of them to end up confirming, unless you were sending the coins to yourself, in which case you presumably don't care).
I can help you to do that if you like. Are you able to install a copy of Bitcoin Core? You won't need a copy of the blockchain to use Core to send a conflicting transaction with a fee.
I'm guessing you used the blockchain.info wallet to create the zero-fee transaction. I wouldn't recommend using their wallet - it has a terrible history of all manner of glitches.
I notice that you've also spent the change of the transaction you linked to. If you can successfully double-spend the first transaction then the neither of your 3 BTC transactions will ever be able to confirm.

If everyone refused to sell below $1500 (and that's a big if) then the price would be $1500... The problem is that at that price there would be less demand than there currently is, and more supply than there currently is. Lots of people would be willing to sell at $1500, but few would be willing to buy. So somebody would be in a hurry to sell, so they would offer some coins at $1499, and then someone else would undercut them, etc. until the supply and the demand balance each other again.

There is truth to this. The solution hasn't been implemented because it requires a soft fork and would likely be unpopular with miners, since it prevents validationless mining, which miners like to do. If validationless mining ever becomes a problem we can UASF it in later.


Zero-conf has never been safe. Transaction fees right now are as low as they've ever been. I recently [donated]( to  and paid just 1 satoshi per byte. The total fee was just $0.01 and it confirmed quickly. Once SegWit activates we will be able to use Lightning to make instant transactions safely for the first time.


Every Bitcoin user should want to run their own node. If they don't they are trusting a third party to validate their transactions for them. The whole point of Bitcoin is individual financial sovereignty. Not sure what the "help banks settle transactions" is about - maybe it's a reference to the AXA fud, or maybe a misunderstanding of how payment channels work, I'm not sure.

Bitcoin Core maintains what it calls a "key pool". When you first create the wallet it makes 100 private keys and stores them in the wallet. These 100 keys will be used for change addresses and receiving addresses as you need them. The key pool will be refilled so it always contains 100 unused addresses (unless your wallet is encrypted and not unlocked, in which case the pool will only be refilled when you next enter the passphrase).
So your backup will be good until you use 100 new addresses (new receiving addresses plus change addresses). After that it will be using private keys which aren't in your backup, and you risk losing coins if your wallet gets corrupted and you have to rely on the backup.
You can put "keypool=1000" in your bitcoin.conf file (in the same folder as your wallet.dat) to tell it to use a bigger key pool.
And version 0.13 of Bitcoin Core should have some kind of basic BIP32 support, allowing you to use HD wallets, which generate new keys in a deterministic way so your backups never 'expire'.

Why would the exchange be using the pre-fork chain to service withdrawals? They wouldn't. They would be using the post-fork chain. The risk is that some third party would copy the withdrawal transaction from the post-fork chain to the pre-fork chain (ie. a replay attack), where it would also be valid unless the exchange had taken steps to put their pre-fork and post-fork coins in separate accounts.
I was surprised that poloniex have re-opened withdrawals already, only a few hundred blocks post-fork.

@_date: 2016-07-22 11:56:59


If you never reuse an address then each of your UTXOs will be at a different address, each with their own public key, and so there is no need to combine all your outputs. If you are reusing addresses then it is possible that you have multiple UTXOs at the same address. If you spend one of them and leave others unspent then you are run the risk of having the unspent ones stolen since your public key for that address is now known. The risk is probably only theoretical at this time. There are Bitcoin addresses with well known public keys holding large numbers of coins. Check [1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx]( for example - it holds over 69,000 BTC ($45 million) and has made its first spend over a year ago.


If you make a signature using your private key but somehow manage not to reveal your public key to the recipient of the signature then they won't be able to verify that the signature is legit. You need the public key to verify a signature. For this reason when you sign a message in a Bitcoin wallet the resulting 'signature' string will contain the public key as well as the cryptographic signature. When you sign a transaction the signature doesn't include the public key, but the public key is included alongside the signature in the transaction.

I never heard of rimbit before but those guys all sound crazy. Reading through that thread they seem to all believe that the Bitcoin difficulty is programmed to go up exponentially and miners are struggling to keep up. The truth, of course, is that the hashrate is going up exponentially and the difficulty is keeping up.


But he must have flunked elementary math or be lacking in common sense to set the difficulty on the geometric progression that it is on.
This flaw will destroy his coin and all others using the BTC mining system.
Effectively they're saying nobody will mine in the future because too many people will be mining.










The article he's quoting to back up his claim that Moore's law will cause miners to shut down concludes that Moore's law will keep miners profitable "much longer".
Really, read the thread. For the lulz.

Note that for most HD wallets if you have the master public key and *any* private key then you can derive all the other private keys.
That isn't the case if the wallet uses hardened derivation (like Bitcoin Core, for instance) but is the case for most wallets (Trezor, Ledger, Mycelium, Electrum, most web wallets, etc.)

There are no accounts. There are addresses. All Bitcoin addresses you create are anonymous until you leak information tying them to you.
So you make a new address. Nobody in the world knows the address except you, and so the address is "completely anonymous".
Then you need payment from someone. You tell him your address. Now he knows that address belongs to you. If he also knows your IP address then he can tie the address to your IP address. And so on.
Later, when you spend from that address, everyone can see that the coins you are spending came from the guy who sent them to you.
But Bitcoin itself doesn't track IP addresses, certainly not of the machine that created the address.
It is probably worth reading up more about how Bitcoin works, given how you seem stuck on the idea of "opening an account" with Bitcoin...

No. "Unconfirmed" simply means "not confirmed". ie. "not on the blockchain". It doesn't imply anything about whether the transaction has been broadcast or not.
To see this more clearly here's an experiment you can carry out for yourself: Try disabling all networking, then create a transaction in Bitcoin Core. Double-click the transaction, and you'll see:
    Status: 0/unconfirmed, in memory pool
That is a transaction that hasn't been confirmed and hasn't been broadcast to any other node, and yet it is still an unconfirmed transaction.


It's "you're", a contraction of "you are". See, I'm helping you right now, even as you falsely accuse me of abuse!

Airgapped is safer than non airgapped, and most hardware wallets don't support airgapped use as far as I can tell.

I think he's worried about the other 0.1% of the time, when it is basically an 'online wallet'.

He said it's BIP38 encrypted. He presumably has a bunch of paper wallets each with the same passphrase. He can give us an encrypted but empty paper wallet, and if we can provide the corresponding private key he will know we know the passphrase. Then he can escrow the coins and release them in exchange for the passphrase.

The way that Bitcoin works is that every full node in the network stores and validates every transaction that anyone makes. This means Bitcoin as it stands cannot scale to be a high volume payment network.
When every purchase made by everyone needs to be stored, you find that only the best funded organizations can afford to run a full node. That reduces the distribution of nodes, and makes it easier for the remaining nodes to be attacked by someone wishing harm to the network.
The choice is between allowing every trivial transaction on the blockchain or keeping the Bitcoin network secure from attack.

@_date: 2016-07-29 07:45:32
You can create the transaction on an online machine which has the blockchain and only use the offline machine to sign it.
Recent versions of Core have watchonly addresses, and a 'fundrawtransaction' RPC call that can select which coins to use to fund a transaction and send the rest to a new change address even without having the private keys available.
It's kind of awkward to use, but it works. You don't need a copy of the blockchain to sign a transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-14 04:54:34
I noticed the same. I expect the address he published is his deposit address on an exchange or something. Donations to his address get credited to his account balance, and then used to fund withdrawals made by other users.
Looking at [the chart of the account balance over time]( there are way too many 'withdrawals' being done for it to be one person I think.
@_date: 2016-07-23 23:42:18
OK, so the time complexity of the best known algorithm for finding a public key from an N bit private key is O(2^(N/2)), meaning it takes 2^128 steps, and so there's no point making the search space for brute-forcing the private key any bigger than 2^128.
Is that your point? We 'only' have 128 bits of security already, so there's no need to use more than 128 bits of entropy when generating a private key?
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:39:54


Miners are free to include whichever transactions they like in their blocks. Typically they will include whichever ones are paying the higher fee (per byte), since they get to keep the fees.


The first transaction in a block creates new coins (current 12.5 BTC per block) and gives it to the miner. Each miner will have a different address, and so that first transaction will be different for each miner. Because of that no two miners are working on exactly the same block. But yes, the first one wins.


Yes. Or maybe they have a private arrangement with someone and are paid in some other way to prioritize some transactions (or maybe even to ignore some transactions). There's no way of knowing.


Yes, it's possible but there's always going to be some miner who will mine a transaction if it has a high enough fee. Recently, since the spam attack on the network has stopped, there have been less than 1 MB worth of transactions per 10 minutes and so blocks haven't been full. That means it is often possible to get transactions mined with very low fees, like 1 satoshi per byte.


It's quick and easy to check the validity of a new block. There's no need to interrupt your mining rigs until you have validated it. Some miners will start mining on top of a new block even before they have validated it to maximize their chance of finding the next block. If it takes you 10 seconds to download and validate a block, that's 10 seconds that you're not trying to mine on top of that block if you wait for the validation to complete before updating your miners.


I'm happy to help. Is there anything else?

@_date: 2018-12-21 22:47:58


I disagree.
1. A hardware wallet looks like a hardware wallet. A linux laptop doesn't. This makes the hardware wallet more attractive to the would-be thief.
2. No hardware wallet that I've seen offers any kind of private key encryption. They store the seed phrase in plain text. Linux offers full-disk encryption natively.
3. People in the supply chain of a hardware wallet know you'll be storing private keys on it and have an incentive modify it to leak those private keys. People selling you a laptop have no idea what you're going to use it for.
4. Hardware wallets are pretty much black boxes. In some cases even the firmware is closed source, and so you're trusting the manufacturer with your coins.
5. If all you are doing is signing transactions then there's little need to update software on the offline machine. And if you do want to update there's no need to "connect it to the web" to do so. You can copy over just the updated files after carefully auditing them.
6. Almost all hardware wallet use I've seen involves directly connecting the hardware wallet to an online computer. With a linux laptop there's no need to ever put it online like that.

      "time": 1354116278,
    $ python

    1319
ie. it only took 1319 days.
It's meant to take 4 years, but the hash rate was pretty much constantly increasing, and the difficulty always lags behind, only adjusting every 2016 blocks, so blocks are usually found a little too quickly. In fact over the last 210k blocks the average time per block was only 9 minutes:

The people who want a hard fork don't seem to support SegWit (either because it breaks ASICBOOST, or because they have swallowed the koolaid mixed up by people who want to keep using ASICBOOST), and the whole point of implementing SegWit the way it was done is to avoid needing to hard fork just to increase the block size limit.
So people either want a hard fork, or they want SegWit. Nobody wants both of them. That's just silly. Apparently some people had a private meeting and "decided" the future of Bitcoin. They don't seem to understand that the future of Bitcoin isn't decided in private meetings.

That is wrong. I posted in reply to him [here](
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:15:35
What he means is that he borrowed some ETH and sold it, and now is waiting for the price to drop so he can buy it back cheaper and keep the difference.
Let's say the price of ETH is 0.16 at the moment (to make the math easier). That means 0.2 BTC is worth 1.25 ETH. When shorting you get to choose how much leverage to use. Let's say he went 10x. So he borrowed 12.5 ETH and sold them immediately for 2 BTC.
If he waits until the price of ETH is 0.096, he can buy the borrowed 12.5 ETH back for 1.2 BTC, and use them to repay the loan.
Then he has the 0.2 he started with and 0.8 more from shorting ETH while the price dropped, meaning he turned his 0.2 BTC into 1 BTC. Note that even though the price of ETH only dropped from 0.16 to 0.096, losing less than 50% of its value, he has 5x'ed his starting money due to the power of leverage.
The problem with this scheme is that if the price goes up much above the 0.16 starting price at any point he will be forced to buy back the borrowed ETH at the higher price to pay off the loan, using the starting 0.2 BTC to cover the price increase.
The higher the leverage you choose to use, the less you can handle the price moving against you before you are forced into rebuying at a loss.
You can make these kinds of trades at poloniex and bitfinex.

We already knew that it was theoretically possible to split one blockchain into two. It remains to be seen whether that is of any use.
The ethereum chain split at block 192k. The original censorship resistant chain is currently at block  [e00273ae / e00273ae], and the new bailout chain is at block  [a13ae7bb / a13ae7bb]. It is possible to use both chains independently of each other.

If you notice that the price tends to be drawn to $666, and you see the price is currently $670 then you should sell now and buy back when it drops back to $666. If it's currently $660 you should buy now and sell when it gets back to $666. Both of these actions will tend to bring the price closer to $666.

It would probably be much faster to ignore the known public key other than in the cases where the checksum is valid. WIF private keys have a [32 bit sha256 checksum]( built in, so you can quickly reject 1 in 4 billion candidates without doing any ECDSA math at all. That way it would be able to restore 5 missing characters without the user needing to remember the public address:

That seems unlikely. Optimal coin management would depend on my requirements and Electrum doesn't know them.
For example, if I know I'm not going to want to spend from my wallet for a few weeks, and I know it's currently very fragmented I might want to consolidate the outputs into a single large output with a low free payment to myself which would take a week to confirm. I wouldn't want to do that if I knew I was expecting to make a payment the next day though.

True, but the market participants are the ones who decide the price of the coins on each side of the fork, and those prices determine which side of the fork it is most cost effective for the miners to work on.


The users control the decision the miners make by setting the prices. If the economic majority is dumping legacy coins and buying up UASF coins the market prices will reflect that, and the miners will quickly follow along.

There are many advantages. For example:
Bitcoin is permissionless. You don't need to ask permission to send money to anyone. When using your bank you have to hope that they don't block the payment. If you try to pay someone they don't want you to pay they can and will prevent you paying them.
Bitcoin is irreversible. When you pay someone using Bitcoin they stay paid. When you pay using a bank the recipient doesn't know whether the payment is will be reversed or not.
Bitcoin has a fixed supply. There will never be more than 21 million BTC, but the dollars in your bank are continuously being debased as more and more dollars are created all the time.

I have a $2000 daily limit, but have been able to withdraw every day for the last 6 weeks.
I don't use email confirmations, I use 2FA. It's quicker that way since you don't have to wait for emails to arrive and be processed. (See  - you can turn off email verification there if you have 2FA set up : "With 2FA enabled, you will be asked to enter your 2FA code when placing withdrawals. You may optionally opt out of the additional step of email validation so that withdrawals are placed immediately after you enter your code").
The delay between requesting a withdrawal and seeing a transaction in my mempool is usually between 1 and 3 minutes. In the last 3 weeks it has been within 10 minutes every day.
The longest I've had to wait was 60 minutes, on 15th May, and the 2nd longest was 49 minutes on both 16th and 17th May. Other than those 3, the longest delay I've seen was 10 minutes on 15th June.

That's right. If you and I are trading directly then nobody else sees anything other than when we initially fund the 2-of-2 address, and when we finally publish the final transaction which closes the channel and sends the coins back to us. All the back-and-forth is entirely private between the two of us (and whoever is eavesdropping on our communication if we don't encrypt it, I guess).
In the more general case I won't have a direct channel open with you, and our payments will be routed through middle men. Those nodes will see our transactions even though they aren't broadcast. We can't know that they don't collect them and sell them to others. But if we care, we can simply open a channel between the two of us.

Your wallet is just a bunch of private keys, which in turn are just a bunch of big numbers.  Make regular backups of it in multiple locations so you don't lose it in a house fire or hard drive crash.
Your client software should offer encryption of the wallet.  If you use a good enough passphrase your backups are useless without knowledge of the passphrase for whoever finds them.

No, you're missing his point. He's asking if we will lose 0.25 satoshis in each reward, since the block reward 'should' be `0.0244 1406 25`, and the `25` on the end goes beyond the 8 decimal places BTC values are allowed to have. What happens is anything past the 8th decimal place is rounded down to zero. This is why the total of all rewards can never quite reach 21 million - all the rounding down means we're always a little short.

You could refuse to give out the 21st address until one of the previous 20 was used. In practice I have never had a gap greater than 4 and so I doubt the 20 limit would ever be an issue for me. (I use a local copy of  to generate extra receiving addresses when I need them, but would prefer if Mycelium would do it for me).


OK, I've never rooted an Android device. I didn't know it required wiping data. I'll edit my comment to reflect this.


Does Mycelium store the seed only in the secure enclave when available? As I understood it a key difference between breadwallet and Mycelium is that breadwallet will refuse to even install if the secure storage isn't available, whereas Mycelium will run anywhere and not even complain if secure storage isn't available. Can you comment on that please?


* breadwallet's first address is `m/0'/0/0` (same as Hive wallet)
* Core's is `m/0'/0'/0'` (as you say, hardened at the address level)
* Mycelium's is `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0` (same as Copay and Trezor)


Where can I find that option? I don't see it in the settings. What happens if I don't opt in and enter my PIN wrong 3 times? Is my seed securely wiped from the device? That would be ideal.

The site checks for new deposits once per minute.  If your deposit has been confirmed for more than a minute and hasn't been credited then something's wrong, and you should email the address at the end of the FAQ tab on the site.  But no, you shouldn't be worried.  We'll sort it out.
Usually what has happened is that the player got a deposit address for one account, then switched accounts accidentally (cleared cookies, switched machines, clicked 'logout' when drunk) and is waiting for the deposit to be credited to his new account.
Another common mistake is that the player enabled "auto invest" in the options and hasn't noticed that his deposit has already been credited to his account and invested, leaving a balance of 0 BTC available to play with.

It could, but then everyone's trusting an internet database.  The owners of the database send you coins that they had already spent elsewhere, and then when you query them asking "is this coin unspent" they say "sure, trust us!".

Bitcoin is decentralised.  You don't have to trust anyone to determine that the coins you receive are valid, so long as you trust your client software, and that's hopefully open source so you can check it yourself.  Once you start trusting a 3rd party you may as well just use the banks again.

It's entirely up to the miners.  Some miners never include any transactions other than the one that gives them the block reward.

If both wallets are exclusively under your control, and you just want to move funds from one to the other you can do so by exporting the private key(s) with the funds from the old wallet and importing it/them into the new wallet.
I don't know of an easy way to remove the private keys from the old wallet, so I'd be tempted to export all the funded private keys from the old wallet, import them into the new wallet, then stop using the old wallet completely, because it can get messy when you have the same keys in two different wallets.
In bitcoin-qt, you can export and import private keys using the debug console (Help &gt; Debug Window &gt; Console).

Mining simply calculates the SHA256 hash of your proposed block.  If it's less than the current target, it's a block.  You publish it, and everyone accepts it.  If it's more than the target, you change it a bit and repeat.

I just tried for a while to find an input that gives a hash starting with one zero.  I found that "hmm" hashes to "0a03...".  It's harder to find an input that hashes to something starting with two zeroes, and much much harder to find one starting with 14 zeroes.  That's what's hard about mining.

I just made an account there to see how it's done. It looks like their wallet is an HD wallet these days. I don't see a way to get the private keys directly, but they let you get your recovery phrase (go to 'security center', and click the middle of the three options at level 1). If you can get those 12 words then you can use a site like  to get the private key of all your addresses (assuming you're using the HD version of their wallet). That dcpos site will work offline - you can save a copy of the page to a thumb drive and take it to an offline machine.

BIP39 is how the words get converted to bits. But there are then different ways of converting those bits to private keys - different BIP32 derivation paths.
BIP44 (used by Mycelium, Trezor, etc.) uses `m/44'/0'/a'/e/n` where a is the account number, e is 0 for receiving addresses and 1 for change addresses, and n is a nonce that goes from 0 for the 1st address upwards, for each address.
Bitcoin Core on the other hand uses m/0'/0'/n', ie. no multiple accounts, no separated receiving and change addresses, and each individual address is 'hardened' (that's what the quotes mean), so that know the xpub and any privkey doesn't give you all the other privkeys for the other n's....
It's a big ugly mess, sorry.

The difference in size between my blk*.datfiles (5936401892) and the bootstrap.dat file (5922535968) is probably due to orphaned blocks.  But both are much bigger than the figure on the blockchain.info chart.

It doesn't seem to be well understood yet how exactly this "badBIOS" thing spreads.  It's not inconceivable that it could infect the CD in a similar way to how it infects USB sticks.
The advantage of QR codes, as I see it, is that I can use a tool to scan the QR code into a text string which I can then visually inspect before passing it to the app that interprets it as a transaction.
CDs and USB sticks have millions or billions of bits of information, making it easy for bad things to hide.  QR codes are limited to hundreds or thousands of bits of information, making them less suitable as a malware transmission media.

I was out of the house all day yesterday, came home to see the site profit was up some 200 BTC, asked who it was that lost, was told it was LaKaShing, and didn't look any further.  That guy's been playing on the site for a week or so.  Some days he wins 200 BTC, some days he loses 200 BTC.  It doesn't seem to be a big deal for him.
There's no way I'm going to throw away 200 BTC just for publicity!  You realise that when players lose 200 BTC, 90% of that amount goes directly to the site investors, right?  It would have cost me 180 BTC to arrange that stunt.  I could buy a TV ad for that much!

You can work it out for yourself if you like.  Start with 5,000,000,000 satoshis (the initial block reward) and halve it over and over until you get less than 1.  That's how many 4 year periods it takes to go to nothing.
Each '000' takes about 10 halvings to disappear, so we're looking at about 32 halvings in total, or 4*32 = 128 years.

I came here to say the same thing.
You can often lend out coins on poloniex for 0.1% interest per day.
If you're lending out 40 BTC at 0.1% per day, you'll be earning 0.04 BTC per day, or 1.2 BTC per month. They charge a pretty hefty fee ("For lenders, a 15% fee is applied to earned interest"), leaving you with 85% of 1.2 BTC, or 1.032 BTC. That's pretty close to the 1 BTC per month that you mentioned.
You're running a risk that poloniex gets hacked, that your account gets hacked, or that your loans don't get repaid for whatever reason. Presumably that's why the interest rate is so high.


At that rate it would take around 27 months to double your coins:

Theoretically a virus could modify the source code of bitaddress after you download it from the git repository and before you transfer it to the USB stick.  The modified version would only have to use a less-than-random seed so it always generates one of a list of several thousand private keys which the attacker then monitors.
This is why bitaddress.org publishes the hash of their script, so you can check that the source hasn't been tampered with.

1. I don't know, but you're asking the wrong question.  You shouldn't back up the file, you should select 'backup wallet' from the 'file' menu of bitcoin-qt while it's running.  That lets you save the backup wherever you like.  The backup is encrypted if your wallet is encrypted.
2. No.  If your hard drive fails hard enough you'll lose all your time machine backups too.  Save well encrypted copies to a few thumb drives, and to a few places on the Internet (dropbox, google drive, etc).

That seems like way too short a time to be true.
The Bitcoin network does around 1.5e18 hashes per second. Hashes are much faster than checking a private key guess, but let's ignore that. Let's say the Bitcoin network makes up just 1 millionth of the computer power on earth. So if we used all the computers on earth we can test 1.5e24 private keys per second. Let's say we don't need the exact right private key, but any key which unlocks the target address is good enough, so we only have 2^160 keys to test.
Then it will take 30 quadrillion years, not 700 million. You're off by a factor of 42 million, conservatively:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 2**160 / 1.5e24 / 3600 / 24 / 365 / 1e15
    30.89594193579619


And that seems like way too long a time to be true.
You have a better chance of guessing a 256 bit private key than of winning a 1-in-a-million lottery just 13 times in a row. That's less than a week's worth of lotteries, not 3000 years.

Some corrections:


50 were created per block for the first 4 years, with this number halving every 4 years thereafter.  Blocks are found on average every 10 minutes.  That's neither complex nor crypographic.  And no calculations at all rule how many are traded.  That's ruled entirely by the law of supply and demand.


SatoshiDice transactions make up roughly [50% of all transactions](  There's no way anything's bigger than it.  As I understand it, Silk Road usage is only a small percentage of Bitcoin use.  I once read that the percentage of bitcoins transactions that are spent on Silk Road is similar to the percentage of dollar trades which are drug related.


No, they were entirely worthless.  It was [more than a year]( after its birth that the famous trade of 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas happened.  Assuming a large pizza costs $20, that puts the value per Bitcoin at just $0.004 in May 2010.  As someone [wrote at the time](

I'm more than happy to answer any questions you have.  It's hard to know how to respond to ill-informed speculation.
The 'hot wallet' having a zero balance is a result of the way bitcoind works.  I refill the hot wallet using a fixed address, but as soon as anyone withdraws anything from it, the change goes to a new address.  So the public 'hot wallet' address will then appear empty.  There are thousands of addresses in the hot wallet, including every user's deposit address.
I'm not aware of any connection between JD and the sheep market, though it's certainly possible some coins have been on both sites.
I'm not married, don't have a pool, and as any Just-Dice user knows, there has never been a problem withdrawing from the site.

Bitcoin isn't an investment operation.  It's a currency and a payment system.  You can buy Bitcoins from people, and sell them to people.  That's all.  There are no "returns to investors".  If you sell higher than you buy, you profit.  Just the same as if you're buying gold.  Or antique barn wood.

@_date: 2013-04-02 19:32:17
Shockingly bad.  Almost every sentence has glaring errors.


No, that's wrong.  The money supply is pretty much independent of mining effort.  50 BTC every 10 minutes for the first 4 years; 25 BTC every 10 minutes for the next 4 years, and so on, halving every 4 years.  We're currently at the start of the 5th year.  The difficulty of mining is scaled according to the mining effort every 2 weeks to keep the rate of supply on target.


No, that's wrong.  From the outset the mining difficulty has always been adjusted to keep the average rate of production at one block per 10 minutes.  Technology has advanced, miners have switched from CPUs to GPUs to FPGAs to ASICs, and the network has adapted to each increase just as it was initially designed to.  No rule changes, just continual automatic tuning.


No, that's wrong.  The currency floats on the free market.  Its value is constantly being determined by the laws of (predictable) supply and demand.


Does this guy even English?  The same USD asset as what?  "Easily insolvable"?  Do people pay for this 'analysis'?


Can't even be bothered to check spelling?


So what are you saying?  We know the supply - it's pretty close to 25 BTC every 10 minutes for the next 4 years or so, then half as much for the next 4 years, etc.  Are "supply side value" and "demand side value" meaningful terms?

If people stop mining then the difficulty will go down.
If lots of people stop mining at once, we'll have slow blocks until the difficulty can adjust, because it only adjusts every 2016 blocks (ie. 2 weeks' worth of 10-minute blocks, but 2 months' worth of 40-minute blocks, etc.)

Exchanges typically operate a shared wallet.  If I deposit 1 BTC and you withdraw 1 BTC, you could get the 1 BTC that I deposited.  They tend to end up with lots of coins which just sit idle in client accounts and so move them to an offline paper wallet or some other secure storage.  That way there will be a lot less funded addresses than clients with positive exchange balances.

It's not possible to "fake" a transaction.  What you can do is make two conflicting transactions, which both spend the same coins, but send them to different addresses.  This requires a little technical know how and next to no computing power.
So you make one transaction that sends coins to the coffee shop, get the coffee, then seconds later make another transaction that sends the same coins to yourself.  Only one of those two transactions will ever confirm.  You hope it's the one to yourself.
Miners are supposed to work on whatever transaction they saw first, when there's a conflict.  But there's nothing stopping them from working on the 2nd one, and if it has a large fee attached then maybe they will.

Well, no.
The private key is 256 bits.
The hash of the corresponding public key (ie. the address) is 160 bits. You don't need to guess *the* private key, you only need to guess any private key which has the same address. There are unimaginably large numbers of them for each address.
The 12 word seed only contains 132 bits of information, and 4 of those bits are a checksum, so really there's only 128 bits of entropy in your 12 word seed. That means you can only express about 1 in 2^(160-128) = 2^32 = about 4 billion of the possible addresses using a 12 word seed.
So no, 12 word seeds are unimaginably easier to guess than private keys. But still way to hard to actually ever guess.


I don't think that's how it works. Else why are there only 12 11 bit words when the private key is 256 bits long?

The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks.  Sometimes it gets easier, sometimes harder.  It depends how long the last 2016 blocks took to find.  If they took more than 2 weeks, the difficulty gets lowered.  The target is for it to take exactly 2 weeks.

If exchange A has bitcoins trading at $100 and exchange B has bitcoins trading at $200, I'm going to move my bitcoins to exchange B, sell them for $200 each, and then what?
I somehow need to move the dollars to exchange A so I can buy cheap bitcoins, then move the bitcoins to exchange B so I can sell them at a profit.  It's this "moving dollars" that takes time.
The reason exchange A has such cheap coins is probably because it's hard to get your dollars onto the exchange, so there are less dollars competing for the coins.
You might suggest I convert my dollars back to bitcoins on exchange B and move the bitcoins to exchange A, but I'm probably going to have to pay more than $200 per coin on exchange B, which makes the whole thing not worth doing.

A single miner could easily process all the transactions on the network, so long as the other miners dropped out gradually over time.  The difficulty of mining isn't in processing transactions, it's in finding the right nonce to make the hash low enough.  That's an artificial difficulty set up by the network to keep the creation of blocks from becoming too fast.
As miners drop out, the global hash rate falls, and the difficulty falls along with it.  Eventually mining would become easy enough that the one remaining miner would be finding blocks every 10 minutes.  But of course that would never happen, because other miners would then see that mining was easy enough for them to be profitable as well, just from the transaction fees they could be collecting.

I wonder why that blockchain.info chart shows the blockchain being 500 MB smaller than it actually is.
I was adding up the sizes of the blk0000?.dat files in my .bitcoin/blocks/ directory.  It seems that gives a size that's bigger than the blockchain though.
Also, although the blockchain files take up 5936401892 bytes, that's only 5661 MB (since a megabyte is 1024\*1024 bytes, not 1000\*1000).
I wondered if it was maybe a result of the blk0000?.dat files containing orphaned blocks, so I generated a bootstrap.dat file containing just the first 222963 blocks on the main chain.  That is 5922535968 bytes, or 5648 MB.  Still 500 MB bigger than blockchain.info's chart says.  bootstrap.dat format adds an overhead of 8 bytes per block, but that's only about an extra 2 MB in total.

There are a few sites which let you play for Bitcoin, but none of them are very busy.
[America's Card Room]( has Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, but your deposit is converted to US dollars when you deposit, and converted back to BTC when you withdraw, so if the price increases in the mean time you don't get those gains.
They have a very decent promotion for new players (free $50, drip fed to you $1 to $3 per day over 20 days, and 100% deposit match bonus up to $1000 with playthrough requirement), but what they don't tell you is that you can't withdraw anything until you provide them with a copy of your government ID. On the plus side they do allow you to transfer your balance to other players, so I was able to get my balance out by selling it to a player who had already identified himself to the site.

Transaction fees may be lowered in BTC terms, but only to keep them reasonable in USD terms as BTC/USD increases.
Transaction fees won't drop to zero.
And mining should always only just be profitable.  If it's very profitable then more people will mine, spreading the rewards thinner, and making it less profitable.  And vice versa; once mining stops being profitable for the least efficient miner, he will stop mining, making it more profitable for the remaining miners.

That setting won't let you send a transaction for free necessarily.  If the priority isn't high enough then bitcoin-qt won't let you send the transaction without a fee unless you use its 'raw transaction' RPC interface, which is somewhat complex.

I still don't like your answer, but it's much harder to tell you why now.
Hashing isn't related to the ECDSA public/private key stuff that secures Bitcoin, and isn't related to the SSL stuff that protects Internet banking sites.
In Bitcoin, a hash is used to turn a (long, 256 bit) public key into a (shorter, 160 bit) Bitcoin address.  And a different hash is used in mining as a proof of work.

If a hacker gets access to blockchain.info's server, they can't steal any of the users' coins straight away, because blockchain.info never gets to see the users' private keys.
The only way they could steal the coins would be to modify the javascript that gets sent to the users.  All it would have to do would be to send the private keys to a place the hacker controls each time a user logs in.  It would be relatively easy to do, given access to the blockchain.info servers.

All the wallets are controlled by JD, it's true.  The game operates off the blockchain, unlike SD.  But saying the bet didn't happen is like saying a trade on MtGox didn't happen because all the bitcoins involved were in the MtGox wallet at the time of the trade.

bitcoin-qt has a pool of unused addresses which it generates ahead of time.  By default the keypool size is 100 addresses, but you can configure that to any size you like.
When you make a backup of your wallet, you're backing up 100 as yet unused addresses, so your backup is good for the next 100 transactions that use a new address.
Most 'send' transactions create change, which always goes to a new address, using one of the keypool addresses.  Also, each time you generate a new receiving address, that also uses one of the keypool addresses.

Yes, to both questions - so long as I know which address is Bob's and which is Sue's.  Bitcoin is anonymous in that I don't know how to tie the random looking addresses to real-world identities.  But other than that, everything is public.
When you get 1 from bob and 1 from sue, they don't merge into 2 bitcoins in your wallet.  Because you don't even have bitcoins in your wallet.  Your wallet is just a collection of private keys (you can think of them as passwords) which allow you to spend the coins at your addresses.  When bob sent you 1 coin, the globally distributed ledger (the blockchain) was updated to say "bob sent this coin to biznizza" - and that's all.  When you decide to send my 0.5 btc, your bitcoin client looks to see what coins you have that you didn't spend yet, decides which combination of unspent coins is best to use, and makes up a transaction.  It will pick either the coin from bob or the one from sue, and leave the other one unspent.  Since you're only sending me 0.5 btc, the client will make up a new address in its own wallet and send the other 0.5 btc (the change) to that new address.  So now you'll have 2 coins (one worth 1 and one worth 0.5) and I'll have one worth 0.5.
To see this actually happening, here's an [example transaction](
Someone wanted to send 0.5 BTC to 1DPtqLP...  They didn't have exactly 0.5 BTC, but they did have 0.216 and 0.3 BTC.  They put those two smaller coins together to make a transaction, sent 0.5 BTC to the recipient, and sent the rest (0.0155) back to themselves.
You might notice that the sum of the inputs is slightly more than the sum of the outputs.  That's because 0.0005 BTC (about 4 cents) was taken as a fee and was given to the miner who put the transaction into the blockchain.
You can click the 'output' and 'spent' links on that page to trace backwards and forwards through the blockchain to see where the coins came from, and where they went.

Well to be fair, inputs.io and blockchain.info/wallet are solving different problems.
inputs.io aimed to offer instant off-chain user-to-user transactions, whereas blockchain.info is all on-chain.
You can't have instant transactions without trusting a third party to hold the coins.

Bitcoin addresses can contain any of the 58 characters (0-9A-Za-z except for 0,O,l,I).  There is a checksum built in, which takes up the last few characters of an address and prevents you from accidentally sending funds to a typoed address (the typo almost certainly makes the checksum fail).  Other than that, there's no check.
So "11HeLLoThis1sATestHows1tXXXWaQHPz" is a valid address - the WaQHPz at the end will be the checksum part - but it's incredibly unlikely that anyone will ever find a private key that corresponds to that address, and so nobody will be able to spend the funds in that address.

Well, it returns 0.5% of the bet.  Since the house edge is 1.9%, this represents a little more than 25% of the house edge, which I wouldn't call tiny.  Maybe just say they return 0.5% of the bet, and don't mention the house's gain at all.


The roll isn't based on the odds, it's just a hash of the txid and the daily secret.


Higher or equal.  The bets are all of the form "lessthan n" for some n.


That's not true of all bets.  There's a "trade secret" recipe they use to decide which bets to payout immediately and which to delay payout until the bet has a confirmation.  I've seen it suggested that bets over 2 BTC aren't processed immediately.
It's probably worth mentioning that SatoshiDice cleverly always makes sure to include the player's bet as one of the inputs to their payout transaction, making the payout transaction depend on the bet transaction.  So if the bet never confirms (because it's a double spend, for instance) then the payout never confirms either.
Finally, you might want to link to [this thread]( which I update every day with graphs and stats pulled from the public blockchain showing how satoshidice is performing.

I remember reading somewhere that the 21 million divisible to 8 decimal places was probably originally chosen because that was about as much as you could represent using 64 bit integers. I think I remember checking the math too.

If you are looking to lend out some coins, take a look at poloniex's lending market. You can get around 0.01% per day interest on loans you make, which compounds to around 4% per year.
The borrower isn't allowed to take the borrowed coins off-site (they can only be used to open leveraged positions), so the default risk is limited. You still lose your coins if poloniex defaults, or in certain rare sudden market movements where they are unable to liquidate the borrower's position fast enough.

No. Each 3 words contributes 32 bits of entropy and 1 bit of checksum. So 24 words gives 256 bits of entropy and 8 bits of checksum.
The last word is 11 bits long, so 3 of those bits are entropy. It isn't all checksum.

I hacked together some scripts for passing the required information to and from the cold wallet using QR codes, and found that I could only fit enough information into a QR code for 2 or 3 inputs.
To give the cold wallet enough information to sign a transaction with 3 inputs, I have to give it the unsigned raw transaction, and details of all 3 inputs, like this:
    bitcoind signrawtransaction 0100000003a5176cb13e48d271a0c3bd02d1fd727c84b2a4023314118fe3b1745efd840d180000000000ffffffff45cbbd163779e46dc692363fee35998dfb356681c17a2beeed2be967b07255180100000000ffffffffc3485fb2b5bfd086a99fff2d8440e06cd01a11054632d3b2fc0448e8e73973180100000000ffffffff01005cb2ec220000001976a91423b9aa628178bd6fb58078aca51fc57c56391f9688ac00000000 \
    '[{"txid":"180d84fd5e74b1e38f11143302a4b2847c72fdd102bdc3a071d2483eb16c17a5","vout":0,"scriptPubKey":"76a91429a158767437cd82ccf4bd3e34ecd16c267fc36388ac"}, \

which makes for quite a big QR code!
Although now I look at it, lots of that information is repeated, on account of all the scriptPubKey values being identical.  I could compress it before making a QRcode.  Or construct it on the other side from its pieces.

Now the same number, showing the rationale behind it:
* 25 coins per block
* 6 blocks per hour
* 24 hours per day
* 365 days per year
25 * 6 * 24 * 365 = 1314000
The 'coins per block' halves every 210,000 blocks (which should take 4 years).  It halved in December 2012, so shouldn't halve again until December 2016.
So we should see roughly:
* 1,314,000 coins per year in 2013 through 2016
* 657,000 coins per year in 2017 through 2020
* 328,500 coins per year in 2021 through 2024, etc.

The value of the shares didn't change.  They still pay the same dividends as they did before.
A big holder of shares wanted to sell them in a hurry, so he sold them very cheaply.  For a short while the price was very low.  Once they had sold out, the price went up again.
None of this changed the value of the shares.
In the same way as if I sell you an ounce of gold for $1, the price is low, but the value is still high.  You're just getting a bargain.

If the transaction that signed the coins over to someone else never makes it into the blockchain then there's nothing stopping you from creating another transaction that spends the same coins.
You would need to convince your wallet software that the coins hadn't already been spent.  I don't know how you would do that in MultiBit, but I'm sure it must be possible.  (In bitcoin-qt I've used a program called pywallet to 'delete' transactions from the wallet before when the transaction has been lost on the network).
Alternatively you could export the private key(s) from MultiBit and import them into a different wallet, and spend the coins from there.  The new wallet would check the blockchain to see which coins had been spent and would see that yours hadn't been, since the transaction never made it to the blockchain.

If you're running the reference (satoshi) bitcoin client, it's possible to find the private key corresponding to one of your bitcoin addresses as follows:
1. Help-&gt;Debug window
2. Console tab
3. walletpassphrase "your passphrase goes here" 300
4. dumpprivkey 1bitcoinaddressgoeshere
Skip step 3 if your wallet isn't encrypted.  The 300 is how long to unlock the wallet for, in seconds.
Step 4 will give you a long string starting with a 5.  That's your private key (in WIF, or "Wallet Import Format), which can be imported into another instance of the client using "importprivkey" in the debug console - but it's not a good idea to use the same private key in two different instances of the client.

There are two unidirectional things here:
1) private key -&gt; public key
It's a feature of Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
I don't know how 'simple' you want it.  Here's something that claims to be "ECC For Dummies" ( but it may not be simple enough.
2) public key -&gt; bitcoin address
That's easier to understand.  A bitcoin address is a 160 bit hash of the 256 bit public key, with a checksum built in to safeguard against people mistyping addresses.  Hashes are very difficult to reverse (or else bitcoin mining would be trivial), so finding a public key that hashes to any given bitcoin address is hard.  Note that there are many public keys which map to any given bitcoin address - the mapping isn't one-to-one.

When you visit bitaddress.org it automatically redirects you to:
That's the SHA1 hash of the source code.
You can validate it as follows:

    $ 
Now of course if the bitaddress website was compromised, they would just change the hash in the URL it redirects to to match the hacked source code.  And so you also need to check  which also gives the SHA1 hash, and is signed by the author's GPG key.  It includes these lines:

It doesn't seem to be a scam. I made thousands of loans and didn't have a single one default on me. I stopped doing it when the interest rate fell (due to increased competition - lenders compete with each other, and only the ones offering the lowest rate get the action).
There was a post here a few days ago from someone promoting their "poloniex lending bot" with lots of details about the risks and rewards of lending at poloniex. I'll try to find it.

Bitcoin addresses include a 4 byte checksum, so you have about a 1 in 4 billion chance (2^32) of making a typo when entering an address and having it be a valid different address.

The more transactions you put in your block, the bigger the block gets, and so the longer it takes to spread across the p2p network, and the greater the chance that someone gets their competing block accepted before yours.  So from a selfish point of view it's good business to mine empty blocks.
But if everyone did that, no transactions would ever be confirmed, and so bitcoin would be worthless, and so your 25 BTC block isn't worth working for.
Interesting dynamic.  :)

It is theoretically possible, but for all intents and purposes impossible.
You're effectively hiding your bitcoins in a particular grain of sand in the Sahara desert.  Anyone who finds that grain of sand can take your coins.  But there are so many grains that it would take billions of years to find one with coins in it.
There's no concept of "address is taken".  There's a tiny chance an online client will generate for you an address that is already in use.  In which case you get the coins in that address.  It's just so unlikely it will almost certainly never happen.

266 wasn't the max *bet*, it was the max *profit*.
That means players aren't allowed to end up with more than 266 BTC more than they started with per bet.
If you play at a 90% chance of winning, the payout is 1.1x your stake.  So you can bet 2660 BTC to profit 266 BTC.
(And the max profit is dynamic - it's 0.5% of the amount in the bankroll - it's currently 286 BTC)

I guess it's something like this:
If I get unauthorised access to your bank account and want to cash out in a non-reversible way, sending your funds to a Bitcoin exchange and quickly being able to withdraw Bitcoin is a good way to do it.
This results in a higher than average fraudulent deposits going to Bitcoin exchanges, which the bank ends up refunding to their clients, so it's in their interest to just block deposits to those risky places.
I expect in most cases they just reverse the fraudulent deposit and so it's the Bitcoin exchange that ends up out of pocket, not the bank, so the argument maybe doesn't stand up.

I think the article is a little confusing, with the PO Box existing in multiple locations, and portals, etc.
The analogy works better like this:
* The PO Box is stored in the blockchain.  There's only one blockchain, but everyone has an identical copy of it.
* Your private key is the key that unlocks the PO Box and allows you to spend your coins.
* You keep your key in your wallet.  When you make a copy of your wallet, you're making a copy of your private key.  It's like getting a new PO box key cut from an existing key.
* If you delete all the copies of your wallet, you've lost all copies of your key, so nobody (not even you) can ever open the box or spend its contents.
* Each key has the address of the PO Box engraved on it.  If anyone finds your key lying around they can read the address and immediately open your box and spend its contents.  Keep your keys safe!

I just checked the bitcoind source code:
    /** The maximum allowed size for a serialized block, in bytes (network rule) */
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000000;
    /** The maximum size for mined blocks */
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN = MAX_BLOCK_SIZE/2;
    // Largest block you're willing to create:
    unsigned int nBlockMaxSize = GetArg("-blockmaxsize", MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN/2);
So unless they change the source code, miners won't create blocks bigger than 250,000 bytes.  But the network will accept blocks up to 1,000,000 bytes long.
In [this post]( Gavin (bitcoin-qt lead developer) says:

As for the 20 GB -&gt; 22 GB torrent, if I'm seeding the 20 GB torrent and a new 22 GB torrent is released, I simply move my 20 GB file into the 22 GB torrent's folder, tell the client program to re-check the data on disk, and it will notice that I have 20 GB of the 22 GB already, and will only need to download the extra 2 GB.  This is because the first 20 GB of the 22 GB file is identical to the 20 GB file, and because bittorrent is smart...

If there are too many transactions to fit in the current block then miners will prioritise the transactions with the highest fees.  Currently there's not enough competition for it to matter, and most miners are accepting any transaction with a fee, so increasing your fee will probably have little to no effect.

We don't need to break 256 bit keys when the address is a 160 bit hash.  So long as we can find any private key whose corresponding public key hashes to the 160 bit Bitcoin address we're trying to plunder, we're OK, so it's at most a 160 bit search space.
And according to wikipedia, breaking 256 bit ECDSA involves 'only' a 128 bit search space, for some reason I don't understand.

Then they email me asking me to disable 2fa, completely missing the point of why it's offered in the first place.  In some cases they have significant amount of BTC in their account which they are now unable to access because they didn't think the "backup your secret" warning applied to them.

bootstrap.dat is for new users of bitcoin-qt who don't yet have the blockchain.  They do the following:
1. download bootstrap.dat using a torrent client
2. move (or copy) bootstrap.dat into the same folder as wallet.dat
3. run bitcoin-qt.  it will spend a couple of hours importing bootstrap.dat, which will cause a few blk0000?.dat files to be created
bootstrap.dat only gets you up to a certain block number.  Once all those blocks have been imported, bitcoin-qt will get the rest of the blocks from the bitcoin network, as usual.  It just won't need to get the first 220,000 or whatever blocks from the network, since it got those from bootstrap.dat.
To seed bootstrap.dat, you put it back where the torrent program put it, and leave the torrent program running.  bitcoin-qt doesn't know anything about torrenting at all.  You'll need to rename it back from bootstrap.dat.old to bootstrap.dat or the torrent program won't find it and will download it again.

You can get a feel for it as follows with some rough-and-ready calculations:
At the start, 50*10^8 satoshis were awarded to each block finder.  Each 4 years that amount halves.
2^32 is 42 9496 7296.  So after 32 halvings, the block reward will be 1 satoshi.  And after 33 it will be zero.  (It's not really a halving, it's a bit-shift-right).
33 halvings take 33*4 = 132 years.  We've been running 5 years.  So 127 years left.

1. It happens every 210k blocks
2. True but it isn't spendable.
3. The supply is capped at 21 million, so you could see that as neither inflation nor deflation. But not all 21 million coins have been mined yet, so you could see mining as inflation. But when private keys are lost, coins are effectively destroyed. So you could see coin loss as deflation.
4. Off by one. When the height was 0 there was 1 block in the chain.

It's possible (if unlikely) that some enemy of bitcoin is mining in the background, with more hash power than the rest of the network combined, and has a longer alternative version of the blockchain.  One day he can publish longer fork and all the bitcoin clients would switch to it, effectively undoing all the confirmations that happened since he started his fork.
This risk is mitigated somewhere by checkpoints in the bitcoin-qt client (see [checkpoints.cpp in the source tree](
    static MapCheckpoints mapCheckpoints =
        boost::assign::map_list_of
        ( 11111, uint256("0x0000000069e244f73d78e8fd29ba2fd2ed618bd6fa2ee92559f542fdb26e7c1d"))
        [...],
        (210000, uint256("0x000000000000048b95347e83192f69cf0366076336c639f9b7228e9ba171342e"))

        ;
and so any fork from before the newest checkpoint (block 216116 in the version I quoted) won't be accepted.
Notice that the version in git (linked to above) has an extra checkpoint, corresponding to the first block in the 11 March chain fork.

That's right.
You can generate lots of different txids easily by including a 2nd output in the transaction which goes to one of your own addresses, and just increase its amount by 1 satoshi over and over until you get a txid that causes the result you're looking for.

As a rule of thumb, you can spend an input for free if its age in days times its value in BTC is greater than 1.  So if you receive 1 BTC, you can spend it for free after 1 day.  If you receive 24 BTC, you can spend it for free after 1 hour, and so on.
In practice if you get a value greater than 0.6 or so that's enough to qualify as a free transaction.

Yes, but for now the block reward is much bigger than all the transaction fees put together.

Back a couple of months there was a player on SatoshiDice regularly betting hundreds of BTC over and over.  See [this bet]( for example.
Edit: it just took me a lot of attempts to get that Martingale link to work.  The URL ends with a close-paren, which reddit didn't like.  Eventually I found that putting a backslash before the close-paren works.  So does replacing it with %29.

If the key space is the set of all possible keys, then halving the key space would mean halving the size of that set.
Which isn't what we're talking about here.  We're not going from 2^160 to 2^159 (which would be halving).  We're going from 2^160 to 2^80 (square-rooting...)

Look at MtGox.  They are holding thousands if not millions of Bitcoins on behalf of their users.  People have Bitcoins in their MtGox accounts so they can day-trade them, or just because they know no better.
Imagine that the guys running MtGox are crooks.  They could have sold 50% of all their users Bitcoins, and you wouldn't notice.  They would be running a kind of "fractional reserve" operation.
The only time this would come to light would be if lots of people tried to withdraw their Bitcoins at once, because then MtGox would run out of Bitcoins to send people.
I guess what I'm saying is the only way you know for sure that you own a Bitcoin is when you have exclusive control over the private key that can spend it.  Numbers in your MtGox account are no more real than numbers in your bank account - they're just database entries, with no blockchain to back them up.  MtGox is a central authority in that respect, just like the bank is.

I've heard about this happening before, but never had it happen to me.
The following steps can be used to re-send the transaction to your peers and may well help.  It can't hurt, anyway:
1. double-click the transaction, copy the transaction id
2. open the console: help menu &gt; debug window &gt; console
3. get the raw transaction string, by typing 'getrawtransaction' then a space then pasting in the transaction id I copied in step 1, then hitting return
4. copy the long hex string it returns
5. re-send the transaction by typing 'sendrawtransaction' then a space then pasting in the long hex string I copied in step 4, then hitting return
That rebroadcasts the transaction to your peers who will hopefully pass it on this time!

If bread is scarce, the ability to cut a loaf into two halves doesn't mean bread is no longer scarce.  Sure you've got more pieces of bread, but they're smaller.  Even if "bread atoms" were infinitely divisible, bread would still be scarce.  We'd have an infinite number of teeny breadcrumbs, but they'd still only feed the same number of people as the initial loaf you started with.


Not really.  The Bitcoin protocol is already passing around huge numbers (public keys, digital signatures) so can easily deal with higher precision amounts.

A bitcoin address is the hash of a public key.
The public key is half of a keypair.  The other half is the private key, which is needed to spend the coins at that address.
A wallet is a collection of 1 or more private keys, corresponding to 1 or more addresses which you control.
(It also contains an address book, a list of transactions affecting the addresses in the wallet, and other stuff, but fundamentally it's just a list of private keys).

Comments on 
1:38:44: Really, if you had done any research you wouldn't be saying half the things you're saying.
1:45:35: The government can take your computer, but if you're smart you'll have multiple encrypted backups of your wallet elsewhere.  You can also store bitcoins on paper, or even in your head.  All you need in order to spend your Bitcoin is the 256 bit private key, which you can write on paper and lock in your safe.  If you can remember a passphrase that you don't think anyone will be able to brute force, then create a 256 bit hash of that passphrase and use that as your private key. Then you don't need to keep anything on your computer or even on paper.  Just remember the passphrase, and when you need to spend the coins generate the 256 bit hash from the memorised passphase, add it to your Bitcoin client, and spend the funds. That way you have plausible deniability - nobody can prove you have a passphrase in your head, and nobody can confiscate it.
1:46:50: Wouldn't you want to remain anonymous if you created such a disruptive tech, to avoid assassination by government drone? It doesn't matter who designed the system.  It's all open source, so anyone can see how it works.
1:47:53: The fee goes to the miners to incentivise them to secure the network.  The most recent version of the client defaults it to 0.01 BTC, but you can set it to 0 if you like.  It's almost always optional, but fees are enforced in the case that someone is trying to spam the network with lots of tiny transactions.  When Bitcoin started, miners received 50 BTC for each block they found.  After the first 4 years, the block reward halved to 25 BTC, and it will continue to halve every 4 years.  It is anticipated that as the network grows and volume increases, the transaction fees from users will replace the block reward and continue to incentivise them to mine and thereby secure the network.  See  for a full explanation of how fees work.
1:48:46: This "Bitcoin is building a rainbow table" theory is provably untrue.  If you had done any amount of research into how Bitcoin works you wouldn't be able to believe in your theory. The mining algorithm is well known.  There's no secret.  It's all open source.  Mining is simply a proof of work.  All miners are doing is running sha256 hashes of pending transactions over and over with different nonces until the hash is less than a certain target.  The 'result' of this activity can't be used to 'hack' anything.
Here's why mining is required.  I have a private key which allows me to spend my bitcoin.  I use it to create a transaction that says "I'm sending my 1 BTC to Adam" and send that transaction out onto the network.  Everyone sees it, verifies that it's signed with my private key, and everyone agrees that I've sent my 1 BTC to Adam.
But what if I create two transactions at the same time; one sending my coin to Adam, and another sending the same coin to John.  I sign them both with my private key, and send the transactions to different people.  Part of the network will see the "pay Adam" transaction first, and part will see the "pay John" transaction first.  There's no central authority to decide which of the two of you gets my Bitcoin.  Miners in the two halves of the network will start working on trying to find a block (by hashing the list of transactions over and over until they get a hash less than the current target). Whichever miner finds a block first will publish it, everyone will see that the block is valid, and adds it to their copy of the blockchain.  The new block will either contain the "pay Adam" transaction or the "pay John" transaction.  It can't contain both, because they both spend the same coin.  Because mining is hard, and takes time, one of the two transactions will make it into the blockchain first and become "the truth". Adam will see in his client that his payment from me now has a confirmation, and John will see that his payment from me doesn't get confirmed.  If John wants to make sure he doesn't get defrauded, he'll wait for the payment to get buried a few blocks deep in the blockchain before giving me his goods.

Once they've mined the block with their huge transaction fee in it, they have to publish the block.
A big pool could then decide to 're-mine' that same block (because the transaction with the fee is now public) and could 'steal' the fee if they can mine 2 blocks before the rest of the network finds one.  For 80 BTC it would be worth trying I think if you had 45% of the network hash rate.

In the same way that using x kilowatts for y hours uses x\*y kilowatt hours, x bitcoins that are y days old (since they last were spent) are said to have a bitcoin age of x\*y bitcoin days.  It just a way of measuring the age of a bunch of coins, where value counts too.

No, he ran up against the house limit.
Players can't profit more than 0.5% of the house bankroll per roll.  His last bet was the highest he could be at that multiplier due to the house limit, not his own personal bankroll limit.
The site's bankroll was around 49000 BTC.  0.5% of that is 245 BTC.  And the 3x bet gives you a profit of 2x your stake when you win, so the max bet at 3x would be 122.5 BTC, which is very close to what he bet.

By "sum of the age of all bitcoins moved" he could mean per coin, so
5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+2+2+2 would be the sums of the ages of the 12 coins you moved.
It kind of implies Bitcoins are separate and indivisible, which they're not.

There are 2^256  private keys, but only 2^160 bitcoin addresses.
2^160 is much smaller than 2^256 and much bigger than 2^128.  If the 'strength' of ECDSA is 128 bits then the fact that bitcoin addresses are 160 bit hashes won't weaken it further will it?

I'm using the offline computer to sign transactions, and so at least some data needs to leave - the signed transactions.
Your advice seems to be "don't care if both your machines are infected, so long as no data leaves the offline machine".
The problem with this is that the bitcoind can be modified on both machines so that when it creates a raw transaction, it sets the output to be the attacker's address, and when it decodes it, it displays my address.  I'd then not be able to tell that the coins were being stolen until it was too late.
Not leaking "secret information" isn't enough if the information that does get out (the signed transaction) is corrupted in a way that I can't see.
I think I need at least one machine that isn't infected, so that I can trust it to decode transactions honestly.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:33:00
Here's what I'd do:
* export all related private keys from blockchain.info and import them into bitcoin-qt
* either use pywallet to delete the 0-fee transaction from the wallet, or use the raw transactions interface to manually create a double-spend transaction including a few
When using raw transactions be careful to make the sum of the inputs only greater than the sum of the outputs by the amount of fee you want to include.  Otherwise you'll accidentally be giving the miners too much fee.
Actually here's what I'd probably do first:
* chill the fuck out, give it a chance to confirm.  It probably won't take long to confirm even without fees.

Whether you swap hi/lo or stick to the same makes no difference from a probabilistic point of view.

That's not quite true.  If I send you two separate 1 BTC payments to the same address, that address will have two 1 BTC outputs in it.  If you try to send less than 1 BTC to someone else it will only use one of the two 1 BTC amounts at that address.
If you used a different receiving address for every payment you ever received then what you wrote is true.

I'll have a stab at it, based on a high-level scan of the bitcoin-qt source code:
The peers you're connected to send you inventories of the blocks and unconfirmed transactions they're aware of.  Your client will check whether your peers have anything you don't already have, and if so will request a copy from them.
You maintain a wishlist of things you want to get from your peers.  You don't ask for everything you want the instant you want it; instead you keep the list and go through it methodically.  For example, if 5 peers all tell you about having the latest block, it would be wasteful to request a copy from all 5 of them.  Instead you request it from one, and remember the other 4, so you can request it from them later if the 1st peer doesn't deliver for some reason.
1. Here you've noticed that one of your peers has a block that you want, because the peer has previously given you a list of its inventory, and you see that it has that block that you don't have.  00000000000002bcab8a is the prefix of the block's hash.  The 2nd number is non-zero, so it's a timestamp in seconds since some date long ago of when you last requested this block (probably from a different peer), and the 3rd is the same time in a more readable format.
2. You got the block you requested in 1.  Not as a result of step 1, but as a result of some request that went out before the log segment starts.
3. The block you got is valid, and is at the tip of your new longest chain.  It's block number 226216, represents a certain amount of work, and has a timestamp.
4. Yep.  It's valid.  Really.
5. You received a message from a peer asking you to send him a bunch of blocks.  He sends you a 'block locator' which is meant to allow you to work out the most recent block you both have in common, so you can start sending him the blocks that follow that common block.  In this case you couldn't find a common block, so you ignored his request.  Hopefully someone else will help him out.
6. One of your peers has sent you their inventory and it includes a transaction you don't know about.  You're asking them for a copy of it.
7. As changes happen to your wallet, they are made in memory only.  Occasionally the in-memory copy is written out to disk.  That process is starting here...
8. ... and ending here.  The write took 17ms.
9. See 5.
10. 61.0.0.34 is one of your peers.  He sent you a list of the addresses of peers he knows about.  One of them was new to you, so you added it to your records.  Of the addresses you know for other peers, you've tried connecting to 191 of them, and have 13148 that you didn't try yet.
11. You check your wishlist and find a transaction on it that you just added on the previous (unnumbered) line of the log.  Notice that previous line has a timestamp of zero, indiciating that you've never requested the transaction before, so let's request it from a peer right now.
12. You got the transaction you just requested.  You add it to your in-memory pool of unconfirmed transactions.  Now you have 449 of them.  If you were (solo) mining, these are the transactions you would select from for inclusion in your new block.  (If you were pooled mining, you'd include whatever you were told to include by the pool, unless you were using p2pool, in which case you'd act much as if you were solo mining).
13. You've just met a new peer.  You're telling him what version of the client you're running, how many blocks you have, etc.
14. Bitcoin is decentralised.  This means we have no central authority to tell us anything, not even what the time is.  But we need to agree on what the time is, so all the peers tell each other what they think the time is, and each peer keeps a list of how different their time is from all their peers.  If everyone thinks the time is between 50 and 55 minutes later than I think it is, then they're probably right, and my clock is some 52 minutes slow.  Each node uses the median of the time offsets of all its peers to decide how far off network time its clock is.  The node you just introduced yourself to is your 196th sample of time offsets, and is 6 seconds off your system clock (that's 0 minutes, roughly).
Hope that helps!  :)

Yes.  "lessthan 2" is twice as easy to win as "lessthan 1", payout out about half as much, and has twice the maximum bet.
This continues to the other high-payout low-probability bets too.
There are some oddities however: you can bet up to 109 BTC on lessthan 2000, but only 105 BTC on lessthan 3000, which pays a lower multiplier.
I'm guessing this is because "lessthan 3000" has historically been a losing bet for the house, but that seems like a bad reason to limit future bets in such a way.
Currently all games "lessthan 32000" and easier have a 500 BTC max bet.  I think if it was me I'd continue increasing the limit as the games get easier and the probabilites get lower.

You can follow all coins from their 'birth' to their current location.  If you want to disguise things, transferring into a shared wallet does the trick.  Send your coins to MtGox, then withdraw them again, to a new address.  The coins you get back will almost certainly not be related to the ones you sent, so people can't trace it.  MtGox puts all deposits into a single large wallet, similar to how the bank works.  If you deposit a $5 bill into the bank one day, and withdraw it from an ATM the next day it's very unlikely you'll get the same $5 bill back.

I'm meant to get 10% of the site profits, and the site profits are meant to be 1% of the amount bet.  So I'm meant to get 0.1% of every bet.
However, historically, the site has only kept 0.189017% of the amount wagered, not 1%, and so I've taken less than I would expect to.
It's even more complex than that, because if you invest, earn 10 BTC one week (I'll take 1 BTC commission) then lose 10 BTC the next week (I won't give you it back), then divest, I've taken 1 BTC in commission on a net profit of 0.  So theoretically it's possible for the site to make nothing in the long run and for me to still make lots of commission.
I only charge commission on new profits you make (so in the example above, if in the 3rd week you earn 9 BTC back, I take no commission from you that week, because you already paid it in the first week).

If you're hashing a 256 bit number and getting a 160 bit result, there are a lot more different inputs (2^256) than there are outputs (2^160) so it must be the case that two different inputs give the same output.
It's very difficult to find two inputs which give the same output, but they must exist, just because the size of the set of possible inputs is much bigger than the set of possible outputs.
You're right that changing any single bit of the input will completely change the output.  But if you change multiple bits of the input just right (and good luck finding the just-right combination of changes!), you'll get the same output.
As a very oversimplified example, consider this simple hash function:  it takes any length string of letters and gives a 1 letter string as the 'hash':
convert each letter in the input string to a number (a-&gt;0, b-&gt;1, ..., z-&gt;25).  Add all the numbers togther.  Take the remainder after dividing by 26.  Convert back to a letter.
So hash('ab') = 'c'.
Change any single input letter and the output hash changes:
* hash('ac') = 'd'
* hash('bb') = 'd'
But look - we've found a collision!  hash('ac') = hash('bb').
A good hash function makes it much harder to find a collision, but if the input space is bigger than the output space collisions will always exist.

How it works: you deposit dollars, and put in an order saying "I want to buy X BTC for Y USD".  Someone else deposits Bitcoins and wants to sell them.  The exchange matches them up with whoever is offering the highest price for their Bitcoins, and does the trade for them.  Your account then has less dollars, and more Bitcoins.  You then withdraw the Bitcoins to your wallet and live happily ever after.  The end.
Oh, and I don't know how trustworthy the exchanges are.  Some have shut down in the past taking customer balances with them.  It's generally not considered a good idea to leave money in the exchanges longer than necessary.  Deposit, trade, withdraw.  That way you're less exposed.

If you mean it makes it twice as quick to break, then I don't think that's right.

That seems like a fair way of distributing the currency.  How else would you do it?  Have a group of private companies form a monopoly in which they alone have the right to print currency?  That doesn't seem very fair.  Wouldn't they tend to produce ever increasing amounts of it, devaluing existing money?  Maybe I'm just worrying about nothing; the government would probably stop that from ever happening.

A potential problem with casascius coins is that someone made them, and potentially saw and kept a copy of the private key while doing so.  In other words you have to trust Mike not to steal the coins after selling them to you.  Mike seems very trustworthy, but it's a risk you don't have when making a paper wallet.

I think I would mention transactions much earlier.  The whole point of the blockchain is as an official record of all the transactions that ever happened.  You mention transactions right at the end, which seems wrong to me.  "The reward" is one extra special transaction per block that the miner adds to the transaction list he's hashing.
Block 5 makes it look as if the target is contained inside the block header.  I don't think that's the case.
And "Blockchains" in the title sounds wrong.  There's only one blockchain (unless you count clones like ixcoin or whatever).  "Blocks" could replace it if you want to keep everything plural, or "the Blockchain".

You can then use tips you received to tip others, or you can withdraw from your tip wallet to your regular Bitcoin wallet.

What I mean is if I want to send you some Bitcoin, you just tell me your address and I send it to you.  There's no way I can take it back from you, and you don't have to give me any information about yourself.
But if I want to send you fiat money, there's no completely safe way for me to do it.  I could use PayPal, but then I could charge it back later.  I could send you cash in an envelope, but there's a risk that it gets stolen en route, and you'd also have to give me an address.

a) green bars above the axis represent increases in buy orders
b) red bars below the axis represent decreases in buy orders
c) red bars above the axis represent increases in sell orders
d) green bars below the axis represent decreases in sell orders
Sometimes you'll see weird looking bars like this, where there's green both above and below the line at a single price point:
That means the market price has moved up past that point.  There used to be sell orders at that price (which have gone down to zero, case d) above) and now there are buy orders at that price (which have gone up from zero, case a) above).
Other times you'll see red and green bars on top of each other, like the 2nd bar from the left here:
That's cases b) and d) - both buy and sell orders in the price range have reduced.

The problem is that the blockchain now contains numbers that can be interpreted as links to illegal images.
It could be argued that anyone running a full bitcoin client is now distributing links to illegal images.
And so we have to choose to either continue hosting and distributing the data, or censor certain bitcoin transactions.
You can argue that distributing a URL isn't illegal.  Tell that to the bittorrent indexing sites that have been shut down for doing exactly that.

Possible explanation:
Bitcoin transactions happen between two Bitcoin users and can happen 24/7.
MtGox trades require one party to have fiat currency.  Fiat currency doesn't move in and out of MtGox very well when the banks are closed.  It's Saturday night in Japan so no new fiat currency will have turned up in people's MtGox accounts for a while.

They're good talking points.  Some people aren't at all interested when you tell them about bitcoin, but when you show them a shiny coin with a hologram on it, they start to take it seriously.
Weird, but true.
I guess in theory I could pay you a bitcoin by giving you one of these things.  You can check the balance online, and check that the hologram hasn't been peeled off.  But the coins are worth more than their face value, due (I guess) to their numismatic value, which paradoxically makes them less useful for trading.

My point is that much of the profit was earned when Bitcoin was much cheaper, and so people valued them less, and parted with them more freely.

There's no registration of addresses, and it is theoretically possible that two people create the same address and so can spend each other's money.
But it's so incredibly unlikely that that will ever happen that for all practical purposes we can say it's impossible.
Of course, if Offline Wallet Generator had a bug which caused it to only be able to create 1000 different addresses then the above is no longer true.  It's important that your wallet generator creates properly random addresses or your money won't be as safe as it should be.
An evil software developer could create a Wallet Generator program which deliberately only ever created on of 1000 different addresses.  He could then wait for it to become popular and 'harvest' all the funds deposited into those addresses by its users.  Make sure you can trust the software you use!

Actually the URLs are directly in the blockchain.  If you were watching the traffic on the wire as blocks were sent between peers, you would see the URLs being sent in clear text.  And if you opened the blockchain files in a text editor, you'd see them there too.
Your bitcoin client isn't ever going to show them to you, but they're in there, not encoded or encrypted.
Here's a count of the number of times the string " appears in each of the blockchain data files, proving that the text really isn't 'hidden':

If you click the 'enable' link next to 'advanced' at the bottom thing become clearer.
Basically you can't send just 0.5002 if you don't have an unspent output of exactly that size or a collection of unspent outputs that total that size.
So instead the wallet selects unspent outputs that exceed the amount you're sending, send the amount you asked for to the destination address and the rest back to you as 'change'.
Like when you spend $8.50 in a shop and don't have change.  You give them $10 and they give you $1.50 back.  Except with Bitcoin you break the $10 into $8.50 and $1.50, give the $8.50 to the shop and put the $1.50 back in your wallet.  The shop never gets the extra $1.50, so you don't have to trust them to give it back to you.

The "provably fair" bit isn't "hey look, 50% of bets are meant to win, and 50% of bets really do win, so it must be fair".
It's: "we can prove to you mathematically that we have no control over what lucky number your bet gets, so we can't possibly cheat you".
So they can bet against themselves if they like, which will affect their bottom line, their share price, and their dividend payouts.  But they can't control whether your bet wins or loses.  That's predetermined as soon as you place your bet, using a hashing algorithm that they publish on their site.

@_date: 2013-04-17 20:17:16
Yeah.  The process of mining blocks is simply the repeated hashing of a list of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions along with a random number to make the hash different each time.  This is repeated until the hash is small enough to qualify it as a new block.
It's of no use in breaking encryption of any kind.  All it does is secure the Bitcoin network by making it very hard for anyone to reverse a transaction that has been buried in the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:48:02

The newest version of bitaddress.org allows you to put a passphrase on the paper wallets it generates, so if someone finds it they can't immediately steal your coins.  If the passphrase is good enough they won't be able to steal your coins even with lots of work.
A digital camera is a good way of keeping your paper wallet until you get a printer.  Just use an offline machine to generate the wallet, make sure you use a very good passphrase that you can remember, take a copy of the QR codes off the screen, and back the photos up all over the place.

You're right, I was assuming a perfectly uniform distribution, without good reason to do so, and so my 'at most' isn't accurate.
You don't publish your public key until the first time you spend coins from an address, but the point is I don't care what your public key is.  Any public key that hashes to the same 160 bit bitcoin address is equivalent to your real public key.
There are 'only' 2^160 bitcoin addresses, so on average I would only have to test 2^160 private keys before I found one that could spend your coins.  It's possible that you have one of the rarer bitcoin addresses, that only has 2^94 private keys that can spend its balance rather than the average of 2^96 private keys, but you might also have one of the more common ones, that has 2^98 private keys mapping to the same bitcoin address.
What I can say for sure is that I won't have to test anything close to 2^256 private keys before I find one that can spend your funds.

If instead I divide the amount I intend to spend into 10 equal piles and spend one pile per week for the next 10 weeks, I'm likely to end up getting less Bitcoins than if I just spend the whole lot right now, aren't I?  Unless the price is going to go down.  But if I think the price is going down then I should probably just wait for that to happen before buying.
So how does 'price averaging' help me?  Is it a kind of a hedge?

Yes, but it's quite common for people to visit Just-Dice, deposit, play, withdraw, then clear cookies.  Or just do the whole thing in "incognito" mode, which never saves the cookies.
So each time they visit, they get a new throwaway account.

Back up your wallet.dat regularly; then you'll have the private keys for all your addresses.  By default when you make a backup, it includes the next 100 private keys you're about to generate, including change addresses and receiving addresses.

That's a new one - laundering money for dictators?  A source might be nice.  The drug trade is a tiny percentage of Bitcoins use.


I think his main objective was to create a currency that could be used without the fear of central banks inflating your savings away.


The fact that fiat currencies are currently being inflated to infinity is generally not seen as a good thing.  If infinite supply was desirable why don't we use leaves as money instead?  It would save all that silly printing.  Scarcity is one of the properties that makes money money.


Aren't the tech-savvy ones the ones you want doing it?  The algorithms are open source.  That means they are available for everyone to study.  Bitcoins are released to the people running the software that secures the network, not to the programmers.


Bitcoins are traded.  Some trades are public, some aren't.  Like with anything else.


That's funny.  They're designed to act like money in an age where state issued money doesn't.


This isn't even wrong.
* What's 'Bitwallet'?  I think you just made it up
* There isn't a single "bank account service for Bitcoins".  There are many of them
* If you mean Instawallet, it was an online wallet service that was hacked a few days ago.  People need to learn to look after their Bitcoins for themselves, not keep them on third-party websites.


An attempt at humour?  Bitcoin is still relatively new, and still gaining acceptance.  It will take time for the price to become stable.  Huge rises and falls in price are to be expected for some time to come.

Why would it be a scam?  Bitcoins were trading for less than $5 each for years, and some people bought lots of them at that price.

Buy in for $50k, sell a week later for $25k, then watch as the price recovers and shoots past your buy-in point.  :(
My point being, how do you decide when to sell?  I bought a few Bitcoins early in 2011 before they had reached $1 each, watched as they grew to $32 in the summer of 2011 and continued to watch as they gradually fell back to $2 in the autumn.
It turns out it wasn't too bad of a mistake to hold on to them despite feeling like a sucker for holding $2 coins that used to be worth $32 each.  
Obviously it would have been better to sell at $32 and buy back at $2 but hindsight's 20/20.

@_date: 2013-04-22 17:00:21
Bitcoins aren't kept in a wallet, really.
Your wallet just contains the private keys that are required to spend the coins at the addresses you own.
The blockchain, which is a database of all transactions ever, is on hundreds of computers all over the world.  It records where each bitcoin was created, and which addresses it has been owned by since.
When you create a block, you add a transaction saying "create 25 new bitcoins and send them to &lt;my address&gt;".  You're allowed to do this as your reward for mining the block.
Once your block has 100 (or so, I forget) confirmations, you're allowed to spend those coins by signing a transaction.
The transaction says "take the coins created as output &lt;0&gt; of block &lt;215434&gt;" and send &lt;1.2&gt; to &lt;some-guy's-address&gt; and send &lt;23.8&gt; to &lt;a-new-address-in-my-wallet&gt;.  You sign that transaction using the private key for the address which owns the 25 BTC, and everyone can check that your signature is valid because you publish the corresponding public key in your transaction.
The transaction flies around the p2p network, a miner puts it into a block, and then everyone agrees that the transaction "happened" and that you no longer own the 25 BTC you mined, but that you now own 23.8 BTC at a new address, and some-other-guy owns the 1.2 BTC you sent him.
In fact they can't tell which address is whose.  Maybe you sent 23.8 BTC to some guy and the 1.2 BTC went to one of your addresses.
In transactions, all BTC values are stored as integer numbers of satoshis.  So 7.8956 BTC is stored as 798560000.  That avoids problems with floating point numbers not being able to exactly represent all 8 digit decimals.
I hope that answers your questions.

When you say "the dollar used to be backed by gold" you mean that you could turn in a dollar and get gold in exchange for it.
You can't turn in a bitcoin and get the electricity that was used to mine it back.
Bitcoin is valuable because it's useful.  It acts how money should act, being scarce, easily transported, easily divisible, hard to counterfeit, and all those other good things that real money has.
While it's true that 'doogcoin' also has all these properties (in fact there will only ever be 1 doogcoin, and I own it; that's pretty damn scarce) for some reason I've been unable to sell it for my asking price of a billion dollars.
@_date: 2013-03-30 21:59:52
Note that if you click the 'Advanced: Enable' link in the bottom line of the blockchain.info transaction page, you can see that he hasn't spent the 0.131 BTC that you sent him yet, and that you have spent the 0.864 BTC that you sent yourself from the 1.0 BTC output you used to make the transaction.
Clicking on the 'spent' link I can see that you then sent 0.01 BTC to 1GrwQN... and got 0.854 BTC in change, from which you sent another 0.01 BTC to 1Nw4V1... and got 0.844 BTC in change which is still in your wallet.
This is what people mean when they say Bitcoin is pseudonymous; once you tell me which transaction is yours, I can trace it back and forth in time and see what else you've been doing.  But if you don't, they're just anonymous transactions.

Yes, the bitcoin-qt client has its own built-in encryption feature which allows you to see your balance and receive coins without having to know the wallet passphrase, but which will prompt you for the passphrase before allowing you to spend any coins.  See 'encrypt wallet' on the 'settings' menu.
By default your wallet is not encrypted, and the [pool of 100 pre-generated addresses]( are saved to disk in plain text.
When you encrypt your wallet, you don't want its private keys to have ever been stored on disk in unencrypted form, because careful analysis of the disk may turn up old copies of the keys.  So the encryption process discards the 100 unused pre-generated addresses which have been written to the disk in the clear and makes new ones which never have been.

I've never set out to build a good reputation; that just happened as a result of my being around Bitcoin for a long time and not ripping anyone off.  I've found that you don't have to try to build credibility and trust if you are credible and trustworthy - it just kind of happens on its own.
There's little I can do to reassure people that I'm not running some kind of long con.  Acting honestly is just what any scammer trying to build trust would do.  pirateat40 was one of the most trusted users on  while he was running his ponzi scheme.  I guess ultimately you have to make up your own mind, and not risk more than you can afford to lose.
I guess one thing I could point to is that if I was planning to run off with invested coins at one point, I'm leaving it too late.  A guy calling himself "nakowa" had over 12,000 BTC invested in Just-Dice until earlier this week.  Then he asked for it back, and got it back within a few hours of requesting the withdrawal.  Here's a chart of how much I could have stolen at any point in time over the last few months:

I've no idea where you came up with any of those numbers.  They don't match the numbers on the page you linked to at all.
Here's how I interpret the numbers on that page:
"In 2013, we should mine 12.5% of all coins, adding 1,312,500 coins for the year. The numbers will be the same for the next 3 years after this year."
Notice that the coins-per-year quoted there is a little less than the 1,314,000 I calculated before.  That's because they're assuming 210,000 blocks take exactly 4 years to mine, whereas 210000 / (4*6*24*365.25) is 0.998175, meaning it takes a little less than 4 years, even if we do find blocks once every 10 minutes on average.
@_date: 2013-03-25 06:46:14
That just means that your transaction is buried 7 blocks deep in the blockchain, and so it would take an awful lot of work by a very dedicated attacker to ever remove your transaction from the blockchain.  That 'confirmation' count will continue to go up by 1 every 10 minutes on average as new blocks are found.
I think blockchain.info will stop showing the confirmation count once it reaches a certain number - maybe 100.  Your bitcoin-qt wallet never stops counting.  My first transaction currently shows up like this:

@_date: 2013-12-03 02:13:34
Well, when you're shrinking 256 bit public keys down to 160 bit Bitcoin addresses using a hash, there are something of the order of 2^96 different Bitcoin private keys that "unlock" the same Bitcoin address.
If you guess private keys until you find one that works to spend my coins, it is overwhelmingly likely that you didn't actually find my private key.  You just found one of the ~2^96 other private keys that can also spend my funds.
This will take you *quite* a lot of time however.

A couple of weeks ago I made a new wallet for holding coins I don't plan to use for a while.  That way if someone 'keylogs' me, they'll probably just get the passphrase for my day-to-day wallet, not the savings one.
Then a couple days ago I woke up in a panic that I had forgotten the new wallet's passphrase.  I deliberately made it long and complicated, but that doesn't feel very safe.  What if I forget it?
Leaving coins on a paper wallet doesn't appeal much.  Where do I keep the paper?  In a bank vault?  Under my mattress?  Neither seems like a good idea.

@_date: 2013-05-04 07:08:12
Yes, if your bitcoins are still at one of your old addresses.
I would suggest 'creating' a new address in your wallet and sending your balance there.  (A fresh pool of 100 addresses was pre-generated when you encrypted your wallet; asking for a new address now will give you one of those rather than creating it on the fly.  That is so that the 'new' address will already be in the backup you made of your wallet after encrypting it).

You somehow managed to get all three rules wrong to various degrees:


If any of the outputs are less than 0.01 BTC then a fee is required.  The fee depends on the transaction's size, and is 0.0005 BTC per 1000 bytes or part thereof.


No, that's not how it works.  For each input, calculate the value of the input in BTC multiplied by the age of the input in blocks.  Sum these products over all inputs.  Divide by the size of the transaction in bytes.  If you get less than 0.576 then the transaction requires a fee, as above.  0.0005 BTC per 1000 bytes or part thereof.  This means that you can include lots of very small, and/or very new inputs in a transaction and have it require no fees at all so long as you include a large old input along with them, since it's the average size*age that matters.


Not true.  Transactions up to 10,000 bytes can be free.  If the size is over 10000 bytes then a fee of 0.0005 BTC per 1000 bytes or part thereof is required.
All these rules are visible in the reference client's source code.  See CTransaction::GetMinFee() in src/main.cpp, AllowFree() in src/main.h, and CWallet::CreateTransaction() in src/wallet.cpp.
            // Transactions under 10K are free
            // (about 4500 BTC if made of 50 BTC inputs)
            if (nBytes &lt; 10000)
                nMinFee = 0;
    static bool AllowFree(double dPriority)
    {
        // Large (in bytes) low-priority (new, small-coin) transactions
        // need a fee.

Could it be that in MatLab you're able to run simulations of many millions of bets, but at bitZino you're playing by hand, and so have considerably less data points?
The more samples you have the closer actual results get to expected results.  (
If you play ten spins and 90% come up red, it's plausible that the game's fair and you just saw an unusually high number of reds.
But if you play a million spins and 90% come up red, it's guaranteed that the game's not fair.

It was strikesapphire.com, and that wasn't gambling...
I didn't break the bank, didn't really take very much out at all - a couple of hundred dollars is all I think.  I ended up banned, along with everyone who knows me.
I started off on the poker tables.  There were regular freeroll games, and I was able to win bits and pieces and built up a few dollars in my account that way.  The owner, Josh, encouraged me to try counting cards on his blackjack game.  He was dealing 6 decks and only shuffling after 65 to 75% of the 6 decks were played.  He kept telling me I was doing it wrong, that I couldn't win.  I kept winning.  Every time you make a new table, you get a new 6-deck shoe.  So if the count goes bad, just leave and make a new table.  Repeat until the count goes good, then bet big.  I think you could bet between $0.10 and $5.00 per hand, so a 50x spread, which is pretty much unheard of.
He also ran weekend competitions.  Whoever had the biggest net profit over the weekend would win like $20 or so.  Sometimes shortly before the end of the weekend the biggest winning would be $5 up or something tiny like that, so I'd put $10 on red on roulette, figuring I'd either lose $10 or win $30 - good bet, right?  Didn't go down well when I kept winning the weekend competition week after week.
He got mad that I wasn't risking my own money, and that I was only betting when the odds were in my favour.  I also referred a bunch of friends and collected bonuses when they deposited bitcoins.  Josh got it into his head that there weren't real people, and that I was playing all the accounts myself.  We'd often have 3 or 4 of us at the same poker table, and be talking to each other.  I guess that was me with 4 laptops talking to myself.  I don't know.

It is a unit of a virtual currency.  25 of them are created and awarded to the miner who finds each block.  All bitcoins in existence were initially created in this way.  You can trace the lineage of any bitcoins you hold back to their creation using a blockchain navigation site like  or   These blocks which create bitcoins also permanently record all the transactions moving bitcoins from one address to another that ever happened.  The blocks form an ordered sequence of transaction history known as the blockchain.  The blockchain is a distributed ledger showing how every bitcoin was created, and how it has changed hands since its creation.


It was before my time, but I think it first came to the public's attention with [this mailing list message](  The whole system is open source, so you can look at every detail of how it works (or pay someone with the required skills to do it for you and explain it to you).


Your online wallet is pretty much just a collection of the private keys required to sign transactions that spend your coins.  A paper wallet is the same, but printed on a piece of paper where no hacker can gain access to it.  See  for a paper wallet generator.  [This might be]( the simple explanation you're looking for.  The thing is, if you're considering using a paper wallet, you're probably concerned about security.  Since you can never know for sure if your current computer is compromised by malware, it's best to take precautions to minimise the risk of having malware get its hands on your paper wallet as you create it, so the instructions are necessarily somewhat complex.

Taking the remainder is pretty fair so long as the large random number is hugely bigger than the number of tickets sold.  Like if it's an sha256 hash, for instance.
To make it completely fair you could say that you'll iteratively take the sha256 hash of the sha256 hash until it's less than the largest multiple of the number of tickets sold that fits inside 256 bits.
So in your example, you pick a random number between 0 and 9 until it's less than 9.  Then everyone has 3 chances to win.
In the sha256 case we'll pick a number between 0 and fff...fffff until it's less than fff...fe100 or so.  Which the first number almost certainly will be.

It's also worth bearing in mind that not everyone trades in USD.  So when you see walls which aren't on nice 'round' numbers of dollars, maybe they're on round numbers of EUR instead.  I think MtGox merges its markets, so if someone's selling BTC for 65 Euro, the wall will show up on the USD market too (after having been converted using an exchange rate in MtGox's favour, of course).

It doesn't matter in the slightest about backing up transactions.  Everyone has a copy of all the transactions in their copy of the blockchain.  There are so many copies of the blockchain that you don't have to worry about backing it up.
What does matter is that you have all your private keys backed up.  That's what's important in the wallet.dat file.
By default, wallet.dat contains all the private keys you've used so far, plus the next 100 that you're going to use.  So an old backup is fine so long as you didn't make more than 100 transactions and/or new addresses since you made the backup.  If you did, you'll have started receiving funds at addresses for which the backup doesn't have a copy of the private key.
So backup every 50 transactions or so and you're good to go.

If you look at the list of double spends, they're all transactions TOO satoshidice, not from them.  They are caused by a disruptive bot that watches for satoshidice bets on the bitcoin network and quickly publishes a very-similar-but-slightly-different transaction making the same bet, but with a different transaction ID.
Only one of the two will ever get into the blockchain, and whichever one gets in will count as your bet, but since the result (win or lose) depends on the transaction ID, the bot could be causing you to lose when you otherwise would have won.  Or vice versa.
Having looked at the most recent 10 double spends, it looks like the bot only attempts the double-spend when your satoshidice bet loses, so it's actually trying to help you win...

Someone called "LiKaShing" keeps depositing 200 BTC, playing, and withdrawing when they're up 150 BTC.  The deposit stays in long enough to get moved off-site, so when they withdraw their 200+150 BTC it leaves the hot wallet nearly empty.  I've refilled it now.


I saw a post on the bitcointalk forums saying how it was dangerous to have massive numbers of coins in a single transaction output.  So I divided the cold wallet up into many 500 BTC pieces.  That involved pulling all the coins out of the cold wallet, and putting them all back in.  That's probably what you saw.


I think you're reading that wrongly.  3000 BTC didn't get withdrawn today.  Most of the big deposits and withdrawals are investors coming and going, rather than gamblers winning big.


I'm in my 40's.  I'm not good at making plans, and really have no idea how long JD will be around for.


You're telling me!  I first had the idea of making Just-Dice about a year before I started coding it, but put it off because I couldn't find a way that I could prove I wasn't cheating the investors.  I have access to the server, you see, which lets me see the "server seed", which lets me know what number I'm going to roll next, which lets me win any bet I want to win, at the investors' expense.  I don't, and won't, but they don't know that.  And so why would anyone invest?  And so why make the site?
Eventually I gave up on trying to find a solution, and just created the site anyway, not expecting much to happen.  But it took off, and almost immediately there were thousands of bitcoins invested.

BitZino is provably fair, which may be what you're thinking of, but doesn't use the blockchain to provide its proof of fairness.  They publish the hash of the seed they use to shuffle the deck before each deal, and also allow the player to contribute to the seed.  These two things together allow the player to be sure that the house isn't able to preselect a higher than normal percentage of bad deals for the player.

If you didn't join a mining pool, I guess you're 'solo mining'.  If you get lucky and find a block, you'll get 25 BTC (around $2,500), but that's pretty unlikely.

In the beginning, it's downloading the earliest blocks, when bitcoin had 2 users who never made any transactions.  The blocks were tiny in those days.
The blocks started getting much bigger in the summer of 2012 when SatoshiDice took off.
And once you get past the most recent checkpoint, the client will validate each block it downloads, which really slows things down.
Having said that, the initial blockchain download is much faster in version 0.8 (taking hours) than it was in earlier versions (taking days).


Well, the download code is pretty inefficient still, and could be improved further.

If you mistype a Bitcoin address you are very unlikely to type a valid address.  There's a checksum built in.
Try sending a small amount to an address you know, but change one of the characters in it.  I just tried in bitcoin-qt and all that happened was the address in the "Pay to" field went pink.  An error message would have been helpful, but at least it refused to send the coins.

No, not really.
It's dependent on it being very hard (ie. practically impossible) to find a collision, not theoretically impossible.
Since there are 2^256 different private keys, but only 2^160 different bitcoin addresses, there are around 2^96 different private keys for each bitcoin address.  That is, there are 2^96 different private keys that will allow me to spend your coins.
That's a huge number, but I would have to test 2^160 private keys on average before I find any one of those 2^96 private keys.  And that would take more energy to do than our sun has left.  Of course, I might guess one of the 2^96 private keys that lts me spendyour coins on my 1st guess.  It's just so incredibly unlikely to happen that for all practical purposes we can say it's impossible.

* Just under there, it says "Use this link to continue playing **video poker** at any time!" which again makes me think you've just copy/pasted from the video poker game.
* The same is true of the blackjack game.  It says I can keep playing video poker.

This is a torrent containing a file "bootstrap.dat".
bootstrap.dat is a snapshot of all the blocks in the blockchain at a certain point in time, and can be used to quickly get your bitcoin-qt client up to speed, instead of having it download the blocks one by one from the bitcoin network.
Once you've downloaded the torrent, put bootstrap.dat in your bitcoin folder (the one with wallet.dat in it) and restart bitcoin-qt.  It will notice the file and import its contents into your copy of the blockchain.  It will rename bootstrap.dat to bootstrap.dat.old and never look at it again.  You can then delete it.
Nobody needs to use bootstrap.dat, it's just an alternative way of getting your client synced up with the network.  bitcoin-qt isn't very efficient at requesting and downloading blocks from the bitcoin network, whereas bittorrent is designed to be very efficient at downloading large files.
If you have spare bandwidth, downloading and then seeding this torrent will help new users get started with bitcoin-qt.

What is the "it" you're asking about?
If you mean the transaction, you have the transaction.  You can see it in your wallet.
If you mean the coins, you never really had them.  You have a wallet containing private keys that used to have control of some coins.  You used the private keys to sign a transaction which passes control of those coins over to some other private keys in someone else's wallet.
He didn't see the transaction yet, so his wallet software doesn't yet know it has control of your coins, but your wallet remember that it has signed over control of those coins and so won't let you sign them over to anyone else.
What's the transaction ID?  Maybe I can rebroadcast it for you if my client has seen it.  There's probably a way you can get your wallet to tell you that.

In order to be maximally useful, you should port-forward 8333 on your router to the computer running bitcoin-qt.  That's the port other clients will use to connect to you.
If you don't have that port forwarded then your client won't be accepting incoming connections and will only be able to connect to the clients of people who have forwarded that port on their routers.
There are a limited number of clients running, and only some of them are connectable.  Leaving your client running when it isn't connectable means it's using up connections which other clients could otherwise be using.

I guess it's also possible that we get a too-high hash, and when we re-hash it we get the same number again, so we're stuck in an infinite loop.  Or A hashes to B which hashes to A, with A and B both being too high.  None of these scenarios are at all likely, and rules (like if we get into a cycle, repeatedly add one to the initial hash until we get a result) can be added to resolve them.

that's not enough.  The house has to have no maximum bet as well for Martingale to work.  Just-Dice has a maximum bet which depends on the payout you're aiming for.  You're not allowed to profit by more than 0.5% of the total house bankroll on any one roll.
Currently that makes for a maximum profit of 247.25 BTC per roll (and so a max bet of 123.625 BTC per roll at 33% (3x payout).  So that's why his last bet was "only" 123 BTC, instead of following the doubling pattern of his previous bets - he had reached the house limit.

This is incorrect.  Any private key that results in the same Bitcoin address is able to spend the coins at that address.
When you send bitcoins to an address, you're writing a script that says "spendable by anyone who can provide a public key which hashes to (this address) and who can also provide a signature created by the private key that corresponds to the public key they provided".
The only information they give is the address.  There's no way anyone can tell whether the spender of those funds used the same private key as the sender, or one of the billions of other private keys which correspond to that address.

That is a subtle point.  Bitcoin's don't really 'exist' in any real sense.  They're just entries in the ledger.  Transactions 'move' them from one address to another, and mining 'creates' them.  When a miner puts a bunch of transactions together, along with one to himself that says "and I hereby create 25 BTC and award them to myself" he's proposing a version of reality.  If he can find a nonce that makes his block hash low enough, his version of reality has a chance of being accepted.  If he can get that block out to enough peers before a competing miner gets his block out, then his version of reality becomes more accepted.
At which point were the bitcoins created?  At which point is he certain that the bitcoins he initially created out of thin air before he even started hashing are his to spend?  It's possible his block will be 6 deep in the blockchain and then a reorg will make it such that his block is now orphaned.  Does that mean his bitcoins were never created?
I'm not sure the distinction that it's the network awarding them to you really helps.  The whole system only works because of the network protocol.  Without the network agreeing that a transaction means something, it's just a bunch of numbers.
@_date: 2013-03-11 22:22:38
I guess if you tell me what exactly you're fuzzy on then I'll be able to help you.
Basically miners race to find a block and get paid when they find one.  The block contains a list of transactions that are considered "confirmed" by the network.  The two transactions I made above (one to Adam, one to John) are incompatible with each other, since they both spend the same coin, so at most one of them can be in the currently accepted blockchain.

If I have 50k in a single input, and send 1 BTC to you, you'll see a transaction 'moving' 50k, as 49,999 BTC are sent back to me as change.
Then when I send 1 BTC to someone else, you'll see another "huge" transaction, sending 1 BTC to you, and 49,998 BTC back to me as change.

Right.  The puzzle is "take all the unconfirmed transactions, put them in a list; add a random number to the list; calculate the sha256 hash of the whole thing.  If the hash you get begins with 20 zeros, congratulations, publish your random number and transaction list and you may have already won 25 BTC.  Otherwise change your random number and try again.
One of the transactions I put in the list is "pay 25 BTC to dooglus for making this beautiful list".  When I publish my list and random number, you might think of intercepting it and changing the "pay dooglus" transaction to "pay tu-ne".  But that would change the transaction list, and it would (almost certainly) no longer have a low enough hash to qualify as a block.
The puzzle is set just hard enough to make it take about 10 minutes for someone to find a solution.  If puzzles are being solved too quickly then the qualifying condition will be changed, to "the hash must start with 21 zeroes" say.

I don't like how Eric's paper is so confusing about backing up your wallet:






There's a menu entry "file &gt; backup wallet" which is both safer and easier than the above.  He's also pretty unclear about the need to make regular backups of the wallet.  He used to claim that you only ever needed to make a single backup.  I see that is fixed now, but now it says:


... but doesn't say that "using" an address is.  Every time you send a payment to somebody, it "uses" an address (to send the change back to yourself).  This is pretty counter-intuitive; a newcomer to Bitcoin is probably not going to think of sending a payment as using an address.  Especially if they make 100 payments to the same address - that's only using one address, right?  No, wrong, and your backup is now insufficient.

Is there any investment that is provably fair to investors?  You have to trust whatever you invest in to not steal your investment and pretend it was a legitimate business expense.
If you can think of a way of making Just-Dice provably fair I would love to hear it.  The only reason for not implementing such a scheme would be if I really was stealing from investors, and I'm not.  It would be a relief to finally be able to prove to all the naysayers that nothing untoward is going on.


If I was a thief, that is exactly how I would do it.  Making up unbelievable "whale" personas doesn't seem like a good way of draining investor funds to me.


It surprises me as well how much trust people have in me.  I put off launching Just-Dice for over a year because I couldn't find a way to make it provably fair for investors, and thought it just couldn't work if people had no way of knowing I wasn't slowly draining the bankroll.  Eventually I gave up on trying to find a provably fair way of running it and just launched it anyway.  And immediately huge sums of coins were invested in the bankroll.


I don't think I've ever said "it's too hard".  I say "I don't know how, but if you do, please let me know".  That's different.


Please do share.


I take 10% of profits, and the investors get 90%.  That seems very fair to me.

Hi Dustin.  You asked for comments, so here are mine:


This is confusing.  A wallet (as in a wallet.dat file) contains multiple private keys.  This would usually be written as "you can store as many addresses as you want in your wallet).


If you're trying to explain how it works, it's probably better to explain that wallets don't contain bitcoins, they contain private keys which allow you to sign transactions which will then be accepted into the blockchain.  Since that's what's really going on.  The blockchain (ledger) is where the ownership of bitcoins is recorded, not your wallet.


I don't think you've mentioned that this 'public number' is hashed to produce your "Bitcoin address", which is all people really need to send you coins.


Well, the public key is trivially derived from the private key.  All you need to store is the private key.


What's your point here?  There's no limit to the number of pages in the same way that there is a limit to the number of bitcoins.  The ledger is as finite as the future of bitcoin I guess.


It kind of is.  Mining is the only way that bitcoins are ever created, and currently the fact that mining creates bitcoins is the primary reason that people mine.  Mining also secures the network, so it's not ONLY the progress of creating bitcoins, which is maybe what you're saying here.


That depends on who's doing the considering.  If I trust you never to attempt a double-spend and you send me a transaction then I'm very likely to consider the funds to be "transferred" as soon as I receive your transaction.  If I'm receiving a large amount from a stranger, however, just seeing it get into a block won't be enough.  I'll want to see it get buried several blocks deep before I trust that the transaction is 'for real'.


Not really.  You work out the difficulty for yourself.  Everybody works out the difficulty for themselves (unless they're in a mining pool, in which case the pool works it out for the pool's miners) and everyone comes up with the same difficulty, since there's an algorithm for working it out, based on timestamps in the blockchain.


Not really.  The network doesn't get to know directly how fast miners are guessing.  It only gets to know how often blocks are being found.  From that you can guess at the total hashrate, but it's only a guess.  If there's a 1 in a million chance of finding a block every time you 'guess', and you find 6 blocks per hour, then I can deduce that you're probably guessing about 600 million times per hour - but maybe you're only guessing 500 million times per hour and getting lucky.




The 51% attack doesn't allow 'invalid' transactions into the blockchain.  It just allows the attacker to decide which transactions to omit.  If the attacker tries to spend your coins without knowing your private key, no honest client will accept his blocks, even if he does have 51% of the network hashrate.

I am often away from home where I keep the bulk of the coins I'm responsible for, but need access to some coins while I'm out so that I can keep the hot wallet of my website topped up throughout the day.
Until recently I've been carrying a few hundred coins on my laptop to use to top up the hot wallet, but now have an Android device as well.
I'm wondering whether it's safe to carry Bitcoin on the Android device, given that I have an offsite backup of the encrypted private key.  And whether it's safer than carrying them on a Linux laptop in bitcoin-qt.
I was alarmed to read about the flaw in Android's random number generator, but am guessing that has since been fixed or worked around.  I also don't see any way of restoring private keys from the backup in Schildbach's app.  Am I missing something obvious?

During the 4 years just before the block reward reaches zero (which happens some time around the year 2140), miners will add 1 satoshi to total transaction fees from the transactions they mine, and pay themselves that amount.
After that, they won't add 1 satoshi to the total, and will pay themselves just the transaction fees.
It's a difference of 1 satoshi, and won't be noticeable.

The bitcoin-qt client has a set of checkpoints built into it.  The most recent in version 0.8 is:
    (216116, uint256("0x00000000000001b4f4b433e81ee46494af945cf96014816a4e2370f11b23df4e"))
This means that if someone with a lot of processing power has been working on a parallel chain and tries to publish it, rewriting bitcoin transaction history, they can't change anything before block 216116, because the client has it hardcoded what the hash of block 216116 is meant to be.
New versions of bitcoin-qt will have new checkpoints in them, and the bootstrap.dat torrent will be updated whenever a new checkpoint is made.
Each new bootstrap.dat file will simply append the new blocks to the end of the previous bootstrap.dat file, so you won't have to download the whole of the new torrent.  You add the new torrent to your bitcoin client, and tell it to recheck existing data.  It will see that it has most of the file already, and will just download the new blocks.
[Here's a list of all the old checkpoints]( so you can see how often new checkpoints have been added in the past.

I should point out that investing in Just-Dice by no means gives you a guaranteed return.
By doing so, you are helping to bankroll a dice game.  People play against your investment, and you have only a 1% house edge over them.  Players often win, meaning your investment goes down.

I only just noticed this thread, when it was linked to from the inevitable "nakowa loses lots of bitcoins at Just-Dice" thread.
You're right it would be trivial for me to play and win at Just-Dice, defrauding the investors.  In the same way investors have to trust that I won't steal the bitcoins directly by shutting down the site and just keeping their coins, they also have to trust that I won't steal them indirectly by pretending to be an asian gambler, for instance.
I'm not aware of any security issues at Just-Dice.  I can think of two incidents that you might be thinking of:
1) One time when nakowa wanted to withdraw 1300 BTC, I had insufficient funds online and had to process the withdrawal manually.  I did so, but forgot to debit his JD account, so he got to have his BTC and lose them too.  I ended up reversing the bets he made with the 'fake' 1300 BTC.
2) Somebody got hold of a list of usernames and passwords from a different site, and tried them on Just-Dice.  They were able to log in to less than 100 accounts, less of 20 of which had funds they were able to steal.  It's hardly a "security issue" if people reuse username/password combinations on multiple sites, and don't enable 2FA to protect themselves.  We refunded almost all coins lost in that attack thanks in part to generous donations from JD users.

The blockchain is a public ledger that records the creation of every coin, and also every transaction.  By reading the blockchain we can see what the current balance of each address is.
The wallet contains the private keys that allow you to create a new transaction that moves coins from addresses you own to other addresses (which you may or may not own).


The private keys are in your wallet.  The signing uses:
  
  
When you send coins to an address, each output of the transaction has a "script" that says "this output can be spent by anyone who can provide (a) a public key that hashes to &lt;this value&gt; and (b) a valid signature of the transaction made with its corresponding private key".

As I understand it ripple relies on a network of trust relationships between peers.  If A trusts B and B trusts C then B will accept an IOU from B, and B will accept an IOU from A, and so A can lend money to C via B without having to directly trust C.
(Or something like that).
With bitcoin nobody has to trust anybody else.  That's why the proof of work is required.  If there was no work required to mine a block then there's nothing to stop me making a chain of 300,000 blocks which would be longer than the current longest chain, so everyone would accept it, and I'd get all the block rewards.  (Until you make a longer chain, starting from scratch, which gives you all the block rewards, etc).

Yes, I'm aware of the issue.  Every winning player could be me defrauding the investors, and it's often suggested that that is exactly what is happening.
I don't see how to argue against such allegations either, other than that if I was going to steal from the investors I imagine I would do it in a much simpler and lower profile way than investing the "nakowa" character.
Here's a story that'll scare people out of investing...
Yesterday I went to make a new offsite backup of all my important files (wallets, keys, etc.) as I often do.  I have a script that archives everything into a single file, prompts for a passphrase, then encrypts the file using the passphrase, and uploads it to various places around the world.  I always use the same long passphrase for this purpose.
Except yesterday I couldn't remember it.  I've used it hundreds of times before, but it wouldn't come to me.  No problem - I can just use a new one for future offsite backups, but what if my local copies were lost?  I've no way (unless I can remember the passphrase) of decrypting any of my old backups.  Stupid brain!
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:40:21
If you use a passphrase with more than 160 bits of entropy then it's not in the attacker's interest to even bother trying to crack it.  He would be better off cracking the private key of one of the famous bitcoin addresses with lots of coins in them.

So long as you keep a copy of the addresses, sure.
I don't see an easy way of generating a bulk wallet at bitaddress and printing out just the public addresses on a separate page.
So I guess it goes:
* print out n+1 copies
* put 1 copy in each of n secure locations
* use n+1th copy to fund addresses
* burn n+1th copy (since your current location is presumably not secure)

A transaction can't be confirmed if any of its inputs aren't confirmed.  The inputs can be confirmed in the same block as the transaction that spends them, but not in a later block.
Your wallet software should only try to spend unconfirmed coins if it doesn't have enough confirmed coins to make up the amount you're spending, so the unconfirmed satoshi shouldn't cause any problems unless you try to spend your whole balance.
The single satoshi transaction may eventually confirm, if a miner takes pity on it.

You sound a little confused.  It goes like this:
* wallets contain private keys
* private keys can be used to create public keys
* public keys can be used to create bitcoin addresses
* the blockchain records the bitcoin address of each bitcoin


Wallets contain private keys.  I think you're saying "wallet" when you mean "bitcoin address".


Yes, it sounds like you mean address, not wallet.  It's never going to be worthwhile to try bruteforcing private keys.


We aren't.  It's 2140.


We're not going to find private keys that have been lost.  It's so hard it's practically impossible.  It doesn't take 100 years to bruteforce a private key as one poster suggests, it takes billions of billions of years.

That's not true is it?  Stolen bitcoins tend to get spread out all over the network very quickly.  It's easy to use shared wallets to break the transaction chain.

Actually it isn't.  For any martingale strategy, the corresponding one big all or nothing bet has a lower expectation.  This is because the house keeps (on average) 1.9% (in SatoshiDice's case) of everything you bet.  With your one big bet, you're betting everything you're prepared to lose, all at once, and will on average lose 1.9% of that whole amount.  When you martingale, you'll often end up betting less than the whole amount you're willing to risk, and so the average amount you bet is smaller, and so your expected losses are smaller.
It sounds wrong, I know.  But check out the maths, or run a simulation and you'll see.  Martingale betting really is better than making a single large bet.  Of course it's still not a winning strategy (no such strategy exists without cheating in a negative expectation game like satoshidice), it's just less of a losing strategy than making a single bet.

Bitcoins aren't encrypted.
Some wallet software allows you to encrypt your private keys, but that's the only place that encryption comes into play at all with Bitcoin.  Are you confusing digital signatures with encryption perhaps?  Transactions are signed using the sender's private keys to prove that they were made by the owner of the coins being transacted, but nothing's encrypted.

I keep hearing things like this in the news, but in fact we don't have to trust each other; we don't have to trust that the currency won't be inflated since the protocol ensures it;  we don't have to trust that others aren't counterfeiting coins since it's impossible, and so on.

@_date: 2013-04-21 05:44:09


I get that.  But you're wrong.  Sorry, that sounds rude.  I don't know how to say it politely while still making it clear.


blockchain.info shows actual transactions.
The bitcoin-qt source code is open source; it shows how transactions are created by the reference client.
Here's an example.
My donation address, 1Doog7, had several unspent outputs.
On 27th March, I sent a 0.08 BTC bet to pinballcoin.  Two of the outputs at 1Doog7 were used, along with a few other outputs in my wallet.
The next day, 28th March, I sent a 0.12 BTC bet to the same place.  Another one of the outputs at 1Doog7 was used.  I received that output on 16th March, and still had it after the transaction I made on 27th March.
If what you say was true, the 2nd transaction wouldn't be possible because the 1st transaction would have spent the whole balance at that address.
I'd be interested how you came to understand things the way you did.  Is there some trustworthy site that claims whole address "balances" are always spent together?


I know that some clients reuse old addresses for change addresses.  But even those clients don't use all the outputs at a given address if they don't need to.


The protocol simply allows us to take arbitrary outputs which we control and sent them to new addresses.  There's no concept of "change" in the protocol, there's simply inputs and outputs.  If the inputs sum to more than the outputs, the excess is given to the miner as a fee.
It would be possible to write a client which never returned change to the user, but donated it to wikileaks.  Or always used it as a transaction fee.  There wouldn't be much call for such a client, but the protocol would allow it.
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:02:54
Except they weren't confirmed for many hours, even with the 0.1 BTC fees.
This was because both cold wallets had unconfirmed transactions in them with zero fees.  You can't get a confirmation on the transaction that empties a wallet until all the coins in the wallet themselves are confirmed.

I wouldn't be surprised if the site goes back to negative profit some time soon.  It's only 419 BTC in profit at the moment.  That's less than two max bets away from being negative.  Especially with the recent trend towards people betting large amounts at &gt;90% change to win.  Although mechs' recent loss may reverse that trend...

*

you'll notice that the inputs and outputs are identical between the two, and the scripts (scroll to the end of the pages) are almost the same.  You don't need access to the sender's private keys to create one of these transactions from the other.

Each wallet you install with have its own addresses.  You can transfer bitcoins from any of your wallets to any address.  Transferring money from your laptop to your phone is just like transferring money from your laptop to anyone else's phone.  Just transfer it to your phone's bitcoin address.


There have been lots of hacking incidents in the past.  Bitcoin exchanges make very attractive targets for hackers because the bitcoins they hold are valuable.  You can spend time hacking an ecommerce site, but all you're probably going to get are credit card details, which are risky to convert into cash.  Bitcoins on the other hand can easily be exchanged for cash.  Whenever you send your bitcoins to any kind of online service you're running a risk that the service will abscond with your coins, or will be themselves be the victim of theft.  Careful bitcoin users don't leave their coins on an exchange any longer than they need to.


Exchanges are for exchanging bitcoins for other currencies.  You have dollars and want bitcoins.  Someone else has bitcoins and wants dollars.  The exchange will match the two of you up, while holding both the dollars and the bitcoins while the deal is made.  So you're paying them for matching you up with people who will trade with you.


Not that I know of.  Last year there were a bunch of high-interest deposit schemes, but most if not all turned out to be scams.

I want to be able to keep using the same address for cold storage.  I think with paper wallets, they're meant to be thrown away after the first time you spend from them.
My typical usage pattern is that I have a large amount of BTC on the offline store, and need to put just 500 or 1k coins online.  With a paper wallet I think I would need to put the whole balance at risk temporarily while I signed a transaction that moves the bulk of the coins to a new paper wallet.
The QR code scheme I'm imagining is:
1) live machine generates unsigned raw transaction that moves coins from cold storage address
2) live machine creates QR code representing that raw tx and details of its inputs
3) offline machine scans QR code
4) offline machine signs raw tx
5) offline machine creates QR code representing signed raw tx
6) online machine scans that QR code
7) online machine broadcasts signed transaction
So at no point did the private keys leave the offline machine, and at no point did the offline machine touch any hardware that had ever been online.

Notice that he was playing at 33% chance, for a 3x payout.
If the 123 BTC bet had won, it would have returned 369 BTC, for a 246 BTC profit - enough to recover all previous losses (some 170 BTC) and leave a 76 BTC profit.
(I'm rounding the numbers down for simplicity's sake)
That's how he always seems to play - double the stake, but play at 33% - then when (if!) he hits, the payout is bigger the longer it takes to come.

That's not quite true.  He showed up for the first 5 days of the month, lost big (around 8,000 BTC in 3 days) and hasn't been seen since.  His losses in those 5 days represent roughly 50% of the profits for the month.
The red line shows 1.9% of the betting volume.  It's steeper in the first 5 days of the month than in the rest of the month, caused by the whale's almost constant presence.
A new contender appeared and played from 20th to 24th Feb, contributing most of the rest of the month's profits.
Also, the site experienced a good deal of luck in February, as indicated by the black line (actual profit) gaining significantly on the red line (expected profit).

It's pretty much the same size as all the blk0000?.dat files stuck end to end.  It will keep getting bigger indefinitely.  Currently blocks are limited to 250kB each I think, so the file can't grow by more than about 1.5MB/hour on average.  There's talk of increasing (or removing) the blocksize limit, but that's not going to happen any time soon I don't think.
The file is already over 4GB, so if your filesystem can cope with it now, you should be good for the next while.  There aren't many filesystems that can handle 4GB files but choke on sizes a few times bigger than that.  [See here for details](

His point was that if the block reward was 25 BTC and never halved, then it would only take until 2021 to reach 21 million BTC (after 4 years 75% of all bitcoins will have been mined, and if the rate didn't then halve it would only take another 4 years for the remaining 25% to be mined).

It is just like a lottery.  Mining is simply the process of hashing a bunch of data over and over, slightly changing it each time until you get a hash that is less than a certain number.
Currently the network difficulty is 3651011.63069321.
That means that each time you calculate a hash, you have a 1-in-((2^48 / 65535) * 3651011.63069321) chance of finding a block.  That's 1-in-15 million billion chance.
If you can compute hashes at 15Mh/s, then you have a 1 in a billion chance of finding a block in any given second.

What is a 'bogus' transaction?  If it doesn't follow the network rules then no clients will accept it.
With 51%, they would be able to ignore every block that isn't one of their own, and only build on their own blocks.  That way they get to create 100% of the blocks.  That's the main risk.
Also, they could decide to omit certain (or all) transactions from their blocks, effectively crippling Bitcoin as a whole.

If you send the whole balance from the paper wallet to an online wallet, there's no problem.  You might want to send a little less than the whole balance - the difference will be considered as the transaction fee, and encourages miners to prioritise your transaction.

You don't even need to keep the wallet if you don't want to.  You can use the
    dumpprivkey &lt;bitcoinaddress&gt;
command to get a copy of your private keys, write them on a piece of paper, then delete your wallet file.  The only way to then spend the corresponding coins would be to reimport the private key into a client at a later date.  This keeps your coins safe from hackers.
(See help&gt;debug window&gt;console in the bitcoin-qt client, then "walletpassphrase &lt;passphrase&gt; &lt;timeout&gt;" to unlock your wallet, and "dumpprivkey &lt;bitcoinaddress&gt;" to see your private key.  Later, "importprivkey &lt;bitcoinprivkey&gt; [label] [rescan=true]" to import the key into a new wallet.  Do this for all addresses you have or expect to have funds at).

The problem is that each time you make a transaction, you probably don't have the exact right mix of coins in your wallet to make up the amount you're trying to send.  So the client picks a bunch of coins that's a little more than the amount you're sending, and sends the excess to a new address in your own wallet.  This excess is known as the 'change'.
If the change is sent to the 101st address and you revert to a backup which doesn't contain that 101st address then you'll never be able to spend the change.
@_date: 2013-03-31 07:42:17
Yes, wallet.dat is all you need.  Make sure it's encrypted with a good passphrase, and back it up using "File&gt;Backup Wallet" in the menu.  It's not a good idea to copy the wallet.dat file manually while bitcoin-qt is running, and this way you don't need to shut down the client.
The wallet stores the next 100 addresses it will use.  They're used when you click 'New Address' in the receive tab, and also almost every time you make a transaction some 'change' is sent to one of the 100 pregenerated addresses.  So repeat the backup process before you've used up all 100 addresses.  Or start bitcoin-qt with:
    -keypool=1000
to make it keep a bigger list of addresses, meaning you can back up less often.
    -keypool=&lt;n&gt;           Set key pool size to &lt;n&gt; (default: 100)

Because of fraud enabled by the possibility of doing chargebacks on creditcards and paypal.
It works like this:
1. deposit using paypal
2. exchange for bitcoins
3. withdraw bitcoins
4. contact paypal, tell them you didn't make the payment, but you were hacked
5. paypal takes the money back from the exchange and puts it back in your account
At that point you have the bitcoins and the dollars, and the exchange is left with a customer who wants to withdraw the dollars they thought they got by selling their bitcoins to you, but the exchange doesn't have the dollars any more.

Does dividing a dollar into 100 cents increase the money supply by a factor of 100?  No, it doesn't.  If it was possible to divide a cent into 100 useful parts that also wouldn't increase the money supply.
The fact that it's possible to divide a Bitcoin into 100 million pieces doesn't mean there are 100 million more Bitcoins, but it does mean that the hard limit of 21 million Bitcoins isn't a problem.  There's a hard limit of X tonnes of gold in the universe, but that's not a problem because we can divide the tonnes into grams, milligrams, or whatever.  That doesn't increase the amount of gold, just the number of tradeable units.

I've seen calculations showing that it would take billions of billions of years to brute force a private key, even if all the energy from the sun went directly towards running the search.

Here's a scenario where it matters:
1) you buy something with BTC
2) you buy something else with BTC using the change from step 1
3) the tx in step 1 confirms with a different txid
4) the tx in step 2 never confirms, because the change it spent (which is identified by txid) no longer exists
This happened to Roger Veg a couple of years ago. When his 2nd tx hadn't confirmed after 24 hours he thought it was because blocks were full rather than transaction malleability being to blame.

Re. provable fairness:  there's an orderer list of all the tickets purchased - it's in the blockchain.  So we can assign each entry a number from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of tickets purchased.  Then all we need is a large random number at the end of the raffle.  Divide that number by n, take the remainder, and that's the winning ticket number.  Entries which pay for multiple tickets count as multiple entries of course.
So how do you fairly choose a random number?
[BitMillions]( has an interesting idea for this.  They use twitter.  Each tweet has a random tweet id assigned to it.  You could hash the tweet ID to get a large random number and use that.  I guess there's a danger that you could post and delete multiple tweets until you got a tweet ID that you liked, but maybe that's possible to detect.  It's also possible you pay someone inside twitter.com to give you a nice tweet ID.
You could have a bunch of people all pick a secret passphrase and publish the hash of it in advance.  Then to decide the winner, have everyone reveal their passphrase, string them all together and hash the result.  That way you can only cheat if all the people cooperate.  But if any of them refuse to reveal their passphrase when the time comes, you're stuck.  That risk could be averted by using  or some other service for sending messages into the future.  But then you can cheat if you can somehow convince the operator of that site to assist you.
It's an interesting problem...  :)

Please please please also make an offline copy of the google-auth secret so that when you lose your phone you don't lose access to your account.
Setting up 2FA is effectively telling the site "don't let anyone get to my coins unless they have access to my phone".  Then, one day when you lose your phone, what is the site meant to do?  You email them, "I lost my phone", and what?  They're meant to believe you?  The hacker who put the keylogged on your computer is going to email them from your account too, saying "I lost my phone".

Log graphs are often used to show prices of things because "the price went up $10" means something different if the price was $1 before (wow, it's exploding) than if the price was $10,000 before (yawn, only $10 today?).  Whereas "the price went up 10%" always means the same.  10% growth is 10% growth.
On a log chart 10% growth puts the line up the same distance on the chart whether it's from $1 to $1.10 or from $1,000 to $1,100.
Edit: incidentally I notice you used the term "log growth".  It's the axis that's logarithmic, not the growth.  With a log y axis a straight line on the graph indicates exponential growth.

* the bankroll for the site is crowdfunded from visitors to the site, so when you win, you're winning from other players; you can lend your coins to the site to use in the bankroll, and get a share of the site's profits (or losses) in return

I think you might still be missing my point.  I don't need to crack your key, I just need to crack any key that ends up with the same bitcoin address as you.  And there are about 2^96 of those, out of the 2^256 search space.
Edit: because to spend an output, I just need to provide an input script that goes makes the output script work.
An example output script is:
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 41e62e616675479fc24f928c4f9cbd25a0bdac8e OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG 
which "works" if you provide two things: a public key that hashes to 41e6...8e, and a signature created using the corresponding private key, proving you own that private key.  Note that I don't have to have the same public key as the intended recipient of this output (indeed, there's no way of knowing whether I do or not - the public key isn't published), just any public key which hashes to the correct value.

No, the amount he was aiming to win doubled on each bet, since the payout on a win is 3x (1x covering the stake, and the other 2x being profit, of which 1x covers all his previous losses, and the other 1x being net profit).

If the cards are shuffled before each hand and none of the players know the order of the shuffled deck that I don't think it's possible for any player to affect another player's odds of winning.
Of course the actions of all players affect which cards the dealer gets, but due to the random shuffle you're just as likely to make things worse as you are to make things better by taking an extra card.
The extra card that the play-money player takes (when he shouldn't have, according to basic strategy) could just as well have been shuffled to the back of the shoe.
Edit: oh, but if I have a couple of play-money players hitting lots before I get to act, I get a little more information about the composition of the rest of the shoe.
