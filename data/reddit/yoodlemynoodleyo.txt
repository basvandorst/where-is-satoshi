“It is important to clarify that we are not accepting digital assets at Starbucks. Rather the exchange will convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks,” a Starbucks spokesperson wrote me in an email. “At the current time, we are announcing the launch of trading and conversion of Bitcoin. However, we will continue to talk with customers and regulators as the space evolves.”
“Customers will not be able to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin,” the spokesperson wrote."

Let's say I buy a $5 coffee using BTC. Instead of waiting for the transaction to clear using BTC (first layer), I give the coffee shop a $5 ETF (second layer). Then the coffee shop can later sell that ETF and convert it to USD.
Robinhood is already interested in the crypto market. It would be simple for them to build a wallet app that lets you transfer ETF payments. 
Lightning could be used for microtransactions (classified as anything under $1). ETF could be a good 2nd layer solution for larger transactions.

I believe ETF is just bitcoin that's held by a trusted third party... kind of like a bank account... I can transfer my "stake" in ETF to anyone else for payments, to settle debt, etc.. It's kind of like paper money, except it's backed by real bitcoin.

This Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin Core feud is ridiculous. We all have more in common than we think. Let's just enjoy being in the same community.

So you can't answer his question either, huh

Starbucks ins't accepting BTC in their stores (probably because of the issues you mentioned using it as a currency).

Good news! It is in full force.

I think what you're describing is a fractional reserve ETF. This makes it no better than fiat, so I think it's important to make sure that any ETF the community uses is fully backed by real BTC.

What do you guys think about using an ETF as a second layer solution? I think it could really work.

Minimum to send through PayPal is $0.01.
I also remember some crazy $50 btc transaction fees last January.

Apparently people needed this clarified, though, because everyone is celebrating that Starbucks is accepting BTC in all of their stores.
