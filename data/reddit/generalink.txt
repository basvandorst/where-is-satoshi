* You can think of this as a “new” internet. Today’s internet is how we send pictures, stream videos and music, and send emails.
But blockchain networks are different. They are all about transferring value. * 'nuf said.
This movement will revolutionise many aspects of our lives, the first real attempt to give power back to the people.

Why shouldn't he describe his opinion? And why are you such a butthurt?
He is doing the community a service by informing us how a company treats their customers and how they deal with a problem.
Delete your internet dude.

I was referring to ALL crypto currencies within the same timeframe.
Talking about bitcoin alone, fuck, it's nothing, we are still at double the value from just a few months ago. Tis but a scratch.(please, please, please GOD!)

Dude take a chill pill before spitting ignorance and educate yourself:
My comment was neutral, I didn't shout panic or hold, I just stated a fact. Use your brain before you talk, it's never too late.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:06:33
Maybe in a ideal world but history shows us that this asset it not valued using traditional techniques.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:14:48
Soooo.. you don't think it's a very good idea to buy now, right? Because I don't know what holds me off from doing it.. With every recovery I feel like I am missing a chance.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:07:14
Sounds more like wishful thinking.
But hey, he is among the people responsible for millions, billions of other people being in debt. So obviously, as far as he is concerned, this is how things should go. Except they won't. Except crypto is the future and unstoppable.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:06:52
I was waiting for this :-)
I have money in since the previous dip so it's all good news here.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:10:41
Most people I know, investors, always said that 2$ k is the realistic price per coin. But based on what?
Personally, I hope it won't go under 5k, not because of my investment(which is done with half of earnings, the other half I already spent on women and alcohol) but because I see it as a movement. Decentralised system, when did we ever said a bigger Fuck You! to the financial blood sucking institutions?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:16:46
Market cap on all, and I mean all cryptos dropped in the past few days at an average of -18/20%. There is panic, not the first crisis but definitely the most expensive one.
I don't want to think of a massive plunge either but if this would be the cost for a realistic evaluation, then I'm down for it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:33:01
The fight started with its inception.
Bitcoin in its entire entity represents a way of opposing the traditional means of the way the govs are controlling the money.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:47:13
Holy crap..
Thanks dude!
I must admit, I am no expert but had some good returns so far. I tend to do impulsive investments when I'm ahead and I am afraid it will backfire.
Either way, I am confident that we won't see it going under 5-6k, at least not for the next 6 months. I am more like a fan of the movement than of the value. Fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:11:51
You sound like someone who invested 200$ when bitcoin was valued at 12000$ and hoped to become a millionaire in 6 months.
You heard this people? Bitcoin is ded, OP killed it.

Instead of spreading ignorance maybe it should be better for Bill to put an effort into paying a fair amount of tax. I mean, Microsoft did write the tax evasion book but come on, enough is enough.
@_date: 2018-06-09 01:13:47
You are either a troll, a 12 yo that doesn’t even have school allowance or a mentally challenged individual. All based on your reddit history and the way you type.
@_date: 2018-03-05 05:26:51
Man get the fuck out of here and delete your computer. You can barely write in english and you claim that you write *algos*, you uneducated fuck?
Go and spread your ignorance elsewhere mr nobody that writes algos for financial institutions.
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:05:29
I can live with that.
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:00:18
Man is a complete retard. Don’t even bother with that idiot. Check his post history, he claims he is *writing algos for financial institutions* but the guy can barely put two words together.
Absolutely every single comment he posted proves the guy is nothing but an illiterate fuck crying for attention.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:03:10
Get lost you illiterate fuck. 
Just one quote of your stupidity: *Try harder friend. ive de olished most of the bitcoin fanatics on this subreddit. You’re another one.*
You’re a poor ass punk with no prospects in life, no real friends, no woman, no future whatsoever and most likely your bloodline will end with you. You suck cocks talking shit about bitcoin and then you claim that you ‘write algos for financial institutions’. Bitch you are so worthless that I almost feel sorry for you, except I don’t. Now fuck off to your sorry ass life little man.
@_date: 2018-03-04 10:22:00
He said that it enables tax evasion, something that Microsoft developed to such a level that they teach their methods to IRS employees. What a hypocrite.
And yea, in essence, this is how the average human assimilates the information.
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:21:02
What a bunch of shit. I wonder if they actually expect people to believe this sort of crap.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:10:26
I came.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:41:44
Stocks seem to be in correction mode but there's too much manipulation going on at the moment and the changes happened too abruptly.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:49:02
He pulled this one straight from his vagina.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:06:37
Yes, and you write algos for the financial institutions. 
Man you are retarded and every single comment you posted from your account is a cry for help.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:17:52
The way I see it, we are going through a process of achieving a realistic value for the bitcoin.
As someone who had a good return in 2017, I never believed that 15k truly reflects the value of bitcoin. Obviously, there were some sharks that saw a good opportunity to invest just for the purpose of manipulating the price and they succeeded. A price crash was inevitable but this is far from crashing the bitcoin as a crypto-platform.
The system was rebooted and my guess is that it will continue to drop to a level that we saw in early 2017. That level is the realistic value of this asset and it only means that from now on, we will see a steady, balanced growth.
Now it's the time to implement means of using the bitcoin not only to buy it for the sole purpose of selling at a later point. The bitcoin lacks a platform of usage and this is what enables the sharks to play with the capital. It was like investing in exotic cars with no infrastructure to drive them on.
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:00:37
Fiat currency is currently being used for anything you can think of and there’s no ‘then what?’ to it.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:52:33
I will totally trust a random dude on the internet, who probably never had a full payday in his life and lives in moms basement, with advice regarding where should we all put our moneyz.
Thank random internet dude!
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:46:55
Oh well..
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:36:54
I am guessing there will be a slowdown in small scale mining. Even so, don't get me wrong, the bitcoin transactions are not 100% dependant on continuous mining,mthere are already plenty of coins in the market. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:26:09
Fiat collapsing? That sounds scary. Out of all the plagues that were set upon us, for this one, I really hope to still be alive.
Just by bringing such a lame scenario proves to me how much knowledge you possess in regards to the financial systems.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:15:29
Among other reasons.
I am no expert but I will be really surprised if it won't go under 3k less than a week.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:10:45
If it doesn't go under 2k I'd be really surprised.
Even so, not the end, just a much needed system reboot.
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:21:36
My thoughts exactly..
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:12:16
December 2017, we just need to find a way..
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:33:23
Yea, I mean, you’re from the internet and it’s not my money so I’d feel stupid not to encourage this:
Yes, definitely, go for it man!
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:48:37
Not very accurate but in the USA it would be around 4-5k per coin. Depends on many factors but it's definitely more than 2.5k per coin.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:37:55
If it drops more than 30% below the cost of mining a coin, I don't think the question will be relevant anymore. I honestly hope that it won't be the case.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:27:41
You want bitcoin to drop further so you can buy at a lower price? Spread fud and talk shit about how this is the end of bitcoin.
80% of whoever invested will not sell for the same or lower price, god bless the human instinct!
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:28:58
There's literally no reason mentioned on that website, pro or contra.

@_date: 2018-02-06 04:34:51
The problem is not the drop, the problem is that it took only a few days to happen. This is what scares people. 
And most sickening fact is that you need to decide extremely fast if you want to hold or sell.

Thanks but I think I will wait another week or so and consider buying at -2k.

Amen to that!
