So to be clear, if I buy my own Bitcoins on Kraken and then later on sell them on Bittrex, this doesn't produce any conflict with the law?

This is legit one of my primary concerns, for the future of bitcoin. Especially for US citizens. government ban on bitcoin or some potentially unknown attack vector seems like the highest risks to bitcoin's future.

I agree with you, it is an issue that will require a real solution. Saying the value of one bitcoin can cover the cost of X amount of electricity isn't addressing anything. The cost of these power demands, as you've mentioned, reach beyond just monetary value. Natural resources and energy infrastructure are fundamental issues  which will be affected by Bitcoin's massive energy costs. I recall seeing this article on recently:  From the article: **If it keeps increasing at this rate, Bitcoin mining will consume all the world’s electricity by February 2020.**
