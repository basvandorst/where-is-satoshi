Stop recommending coinbase

It's about time

Who uses a wallet without password? WTF

I'll be seriously disappointed if it doesn't get to 20k by the end of the month
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:16
I'm just sad that I don't have any money left to buy more

I hope what comes next is John McAfee's prediction

I really can't understand why BCash people has this fixed idea that Bitcoin must fail in order to BCash to succeed. There's clearly room for everyone and (as Andreas says) cryptos are in its infancy yet
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:08:31
No. Next question

The same thing that happens to every scarce resource. Price goes up
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:28:42
Please guys, be right

Bad move. You don't buy dogs. You adopt them.

* Andreas asks reddit for less drama
* Someone posts it on reddit
* More drama ensues
Totally expected or totally expected?

Indeed. Have you heard of RMS Olympic? Not many people remembers it today. It didn't sink, to make a long story short

So, I'm officially disappointed now.

Satoshi is a time traveller who came from the future to invent bitcoin. He's now back in his own epoch where bitcoin is worth 100000000000000000000000000USD 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:46:38
No. That's ok. That's your money, not a loan. I would do it too. Not a loan though.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:49:37
I'm being very conservative
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:22:55
[So, as usual...](
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:28:32
That's not advisable at all. You were lucky
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:40:21
I don't have money to buy anything
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:27:34
Satoshi is a time traveler who came from the future just to create bitcoin. He now went back to his own time where btc is worth 1000000000000000000000000000000 USD.
That's why nobody knows who he is. He wasn't born yet

There seems to be a lot of paid shills around here these days

I just had to watch ONE Andreas Antonopoulos video to understand that increasing the block size is a shitty idea
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:22:36
I'll be really disappointed if it doesn't
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:15:43
Telling the government about your cryptos is a bad idea. Hey, government, I don't even know what bitcoins is by the way
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:42:20
You don't sell. That's it
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:31:45
That's more to the point

These things usually don't bother hodlers

I don't believe in absolutely anything that comes from the government of Venezuela.
