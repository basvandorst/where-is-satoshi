**LocalBitcoins:** unfortunately we only resolve dispute based on the information and evidence on localbitcoins. Offsite communicate is forbidden. Since you violated our TOS, and based on the information under this certain trade, you communicated with a third party out of localbitcoins and made payment to a third party which is not seller's name, this dispute will be resolved to seller. If you are scammed out of localbitcoins, you need to communicate with police for further investigation. If there is need, police can contact us for user's information and we will cooperation with police request.
This scam relies on the seller providing the 'drop' payment details over WhatsApp, then after receiving the payment to the drop alias, providing their LBC-safe payment details over the LBC chat. Of course, the receipt you now have shows you've sent the money to a different person than what is in LBC chat.  
Essentially, even if the seller calls you up, walks you through sending the payment, and receives the payment, and even if that entire call is recorded, all the seller needs to do is provide a **different** set of payment details afterwards in LBC and they can then dispute and win the case, since technically the payment had been sent to a different address.

He said this was a money gram trade, so the seller would have to have given the buyer the payment details.
