When the price of gold increases dramatically it becomes cost effective to mine more of it.  Bitcoin has no such release value and that is my concern.  There is no natural equilibrium.  Hoarding =&gt; increased value =&gt; more hoarding =&gt; crash.

"Equalitarians" don't care about what makes the poor better off.  They care about how fair it "looks" (e.g. minimum wage, price gouging, etc).  Bitcoin looks unfair because those "in the know" with technical accessibility are getting rich and "the poor" are shut out.

I feel ya on the emergence of bitcoin cheerleaders and naysayers without an obvious clue as to how this all works.  A lot of "me too!" without much to content.
Re: liquidity, bitcoin's easy to come by.  I have an account directly linked in Coinbase.  I also know that people's natural tendency is to hold something of value.  Hell, you couldn't get people to sell it when it was crashing, how will they act when it's soaring?  Liquidity evaporates and bitcoin's intrinsic value disappears.
I really do want to hear an answer for this.  I'm trying to believe.

Inflation incentivizes spending/investing.  If you're dollars are worth less tomorrow than today, it's in your best interest to spend them now, or invest them in something that earns interest greater than the inflation.
Deflation incentivizes hoarding.  All buyers and no sellers.

Thanks.  I'll watch it when I get a chance.
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:08:57
This.  You're only willing to sell when you perceive the value will go down.  If the value keeps going up, you wouldn't sell.  No one would.  You'd be stupid to sell something that doubled in value every month.  No sellers, all buyers.  No value as a medium of exchange.  Game over.

Devil's advocate.  First paragraph you mention that as the value rises, so does the hoarders wealth.  This makes the hoarder less likely to sell.
Basically it's like finding a meteorite.  It's really rare and collectors want it bad.  More can't be made either.  If the value were growing exponentially, would you chip a piece off to buy a shirt?  Maybe if you were desperate, but soon an investor would grab it and hold it.  Once the network effects are gone, bitcoin crashes.

There might be "some" selling but most will not.  As the value increases more, even less will.  The system has no release and the incentive is to hoard.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:29:34
What you're missing is that as the value grows people are incentivized to hold.  Why would you sell something that is worth 100x more this year than last and will likely be worth 100x more next year?  It doesn't matter whether you need to convert it or not.
Hell, people weren't selling when the price was tanking, how much more will people hold it when it's soaring?
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:36:13
I seriously want to believe.  Please ELI5 how a deflationary currency will naturally stop rising in value.
It's hard for me to imagine bitcoin won't be like trying to do international transactions with original copies of the declaration of independence.
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:01:51
a)  I assumed that with a cap limit and supply and demand the value would necessarily increase.  Maybe not.
b)  I too have purchased a number of things in bitcoin, but mainly because I wanted to capture the current value in dollars.  It's hard for me to imagine myself spending them when they are appreciating dramatically.
c)  Value increasing doesn't collapse the system necessarily, but people unwilling to sell does.  Which per b) I assume follows.  If people decide to "collect" bitcoin, it loses it's natural value as a means of transaction.  I'm assuming that liquidity is key to bitcoin's survival.

I'm a bitcoin miner and users who's looking to answer honest questions.  This is an analogy to discuss how people would react to dramatic increases in value and it's effect on bitcoin's usefulness in transactions.  If this bothers you, move on...
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:19:09
Well the mantra of bitcoin is that it's value is it's utility (as a platform and a low cost method of transaction).  How will that work when you can't get any?

Faithful bitcoin user and altcoin miner.  I've bought gift cards from gyft and shared on Facebook with my friends (had to try explain bitcoin to the mother-in-law).  That said, no one has yet answered this central oxymoron that bitcoin is valuable as a method of transfer AND deflationary (incentivise hoarding).  As the author says, 
"So how could you think about using bitcoins to pay the rent? You could simply hold your bitcoins and expect to triple your wallet value in a couple of weeks instead."
So I am having some serious doubts about it's long term viability.  When the last coin is mined, how will you get them if no one wants to sell them?  (don't say "infinite divisibility" as this is a property of bitcoin, not a compelling reason to sell it)
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:54:04
Wow, the accepted answer is completely unsatisfying.  I don't know if the community is desperate to believe or unwilling to do the work to answer the hard questions.  The TL;DR answer is effectively "Does it pass the giggle test"?  That's some hard hitting shit.
Understand this.  I'm a hard-core libertarian who loves bitcoin, but I'm not going to encourage my family and friends to use it if they are going to get hamstrung in the end.  I'm trying to believe.

Yeah, bitcoin is kind of a special animal.  No holding costs with high possible upsides.  Only crashes seem to move people to sell.  This is my concern.
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:33:32
Bad comparison.  The value of durable goods are held steady by the fact that you can mine/make more of them.  If gold prices skyrocket, it becomes cost effective to mine more.  Bitcoin has no such "release valve".  If glassware was worth 100x year over year, everybody would be building blowers in their back yard instead of buying video cards.
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:17:41
Uhh, bad example.  A computer I buy today will be worth a lot less in 6 months.  That's not deflationary at all.  Additionally computers I buy in 6 months will have approximately double the "utility", unlike bitcoin which will likely have no additional utility (with allowances for minor dev changes).
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:11:03
By all means, please point to where this is addressed.  I'm an active miner, owner and trader of bitcoin, but NO ONE has addressed this.  How will you get people to sell it once the last one is mined and the value starts increasing dramatically?
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:24:29
So then a simple question.  After the last one is mined.  If the value doubled every month, would you ever sell it (unless you had to)?  I wouldn't.
That's the issue for me.  The incentive is to hoard.
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:09:05
Hmm, sounds like we would need a new approach to loaning money where bitcoin is involved.  Loans that become progressively harder to payoff is exactly what the sub-prime failure was about.

I'm tracking with you on this, but I'm considering myself a rational actor.  If I had 100 btc and it continued to increase in value, I wouldn't sell it unless I had to.  If everyone else were to act in the same way, the liquidity collapses.
I'm a hardcore libertarian and love bitcoin, but I'm not going to get my family/friends on board until I know it's going to work long term.

@_date: 2014-01-08 21:54:46
Ok.  So you think that as the value of a limited resource increases, people will be more likely to spend that resource because they can now have increased purchase power even though they know they will "lose" additional purchase power in the future.  I'm not sure if I agree, but it's the first valid counter-point I've read.  I'll have to think about it.

Those that are against it fall into a couple camps:
Economist: dislike the limited supply and its deflationary nature
Statist: dislike the potential for avoiding taxes and inability for government to control the currency
Greens: dislike the power use for mining
Lawful Goods: dislike bitcoin's perceived use for illegal activity
Technophobes: dislike the secretive nature of the Satoshi
Equalitarians: dislike bitcoin's distribution
Paul Krugman seems to belong to most of the camps and has the largest influence given his status among liberals.

Like an original Van Gogh painting does?  I agree that if everyone hoards bitcoin the value will crash.  That's what I'm trying to square up before I tell my friends and family to try it out.
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:26:40
LOL, says the man named "still_holding" :)
It is purposefully deflationary so why not?  There is no function built in to stop it.  No central planning to manipulate it.  It will be bound by the market which is good ole fashioned supply and demand.  Supply is fixed so how would we stop it from growing until it crashed?
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:47:12
What I think I'm hearing is that if a company/person has a published address "12345", I can use that to make a new payment address "AbCdE".  My payment to "AbCdE" is what will be recorded in the blockchain but "12345" will receive the bitcoin, therefore disjoining the company/person from the published address.
Is this right?
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:21:20
No.  Those that "have" to sell will.  But the bitcoin will make it to those that don't.  Then they will hold them.

This happened to me when buying from gyft.com.  I accidentally paid the wrong amount.  So I emailed and chatted with support and they just sent the money back.  Easy peasy.  Basically bitcoin will incentivize only doing business with people you trust.
@_date: 2014-02-03 18:43:28
The deflationary argument is simple.  I'm starting with the assumption that incentives matter.  Since bitcoin is deflationary in nature, it incentivizes hoarding.  Hoarding makes it difficult to to purchase and transfer bitcoin which ruins it's "network effects".  Hoarding further incentivizes more hoarding.  Then crash.
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:41:56

Money "created" through lending?  
Bitcoins are difficult to obtain because they are new and our legacy banking systems aren't setup for them.  With wider acceptance, BTC will be easy to obtain.  Proof being that it's a lot easier to get BTC now than it was just 6 months ago.

He's a liberal touch point.  What he says will influence many and unfortunately the author doesn't really advance any answers to Krugman's core complaints.
When Btc is worth $1M a piece and they are all mined out, how will someone acquire them?
EDIT: And don't say "it's infinitely divisible" because while that is a cool property of bitcoin, it won't compel people to sell it.
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:42:14
Exactly, but how else would you solve the problem where no one wants to sell it (at any divisible amount)?
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:55:57
I understand that it's infinitely divisible, but how does that compel people to sell it?
For example.  If you found a meteor that was infinitely divisible, but it doubled in value every day, would you sell half of it?  Any of it?  
When the bitcoins run out, how will you compel people to sell it (so that others can buy it)?  Liberals compel people by devaluing the currency.  How will that work with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:42:26
Same.  I sent the wrong amount of BTC on accident.  Support asked for an address for a refund and sent the coin back.  Highly recommended.
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:08:39
You are wrongly assuming that some currencies don't fluctuate worse than bitcoin.   1000% year over year inflation makes bitcoin look like the USD.
