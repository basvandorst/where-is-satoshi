Can anyone verify this with a non chase card? I used a Bank of America credit card and had no problems last week
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:41:39
But better to get it directly than holding it on Mt. gox lol
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:16:43
Can confirm on chase cards but how about other cc providers. Still considered a cash advance?

@_date: 2017-12-12 04:26:30
Buy real estate and collect rent in BTC. Lol. Also a model s I suppose. Model 3 on the way and I'll be more than happy to have that

This is why traditional education sucks balls. 90% of Business professors never owned their own business, how can they know and calculate risk? Economists look in the past; technologies look forward. iPhone &gt; blackberry/Nokia. Netflix &gt; blockbuster. Go bitcoin!!!

@_date: 2017-11-30 10:04:27
It's a joke 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:43:00
Maybe the fees 
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:21:13
Disagree. The network affects are so big that's bitcoin can't be taken down by another crypto. Andreas says the same thing
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:10:21

@_date: 2019-05-20 19:43:54
My friend got hacked too. Lost 20k on coinbase. I told him a couple months before to buy a hardware wallet for $80 but he was being "cheap" or just was greedy and didn't think it was possible to get hacked
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:05:04
Yeah it's called a paper wallet or blockchain.com and create a wallet or mobile wallet (ios) prob the most secure. Just write down ur keys on a physical piece of paper and never store it on the device or notes app. (No screenshots!)
