What disturbs me about all this Bitcoin propaganda is a couple things... Crypto news outlets are the only ones reporting on a lot of it and when it finally does come out in mainstream media it gets buried. Another thing is... Like everyone else has been mentioning... the price of Bitcoin hasn't gone up, it's very stable, on more of a downtrend if anything... Bottom line is from what I see, there isn't much new money coming into cryptocurrency, the market cap of cryptocurrency in General is in a ping pong match between 250 and 300 billion. Granted if you look at prices last year and market caps last year yeah it's a hell of an increase but I don't know seems like somebody's pulling strings somewhere, if you look it up a few studies on the stock market and the crypto Market have been performed, and they said both markets are being heavily manipulated... Even a couple lawsuits. One research team out of Texas I believe it was said tether was used to drive the price of Bitcoin up so high last year. I don't know just seems like for all the news we see about it more people will be interested in the price will be higher...market cap too.

Don't you love how my comment gets buried yet it's one of the most relevant on this page not just some arbitrary glad-handing and platitudes for Bitcoin because it's popular right now for some people... forgot I had made these statements about tether this long ago.... and everybody thumbed it down because I wasn't giving the whole cryptocurrency Market a reach-around. Hilarious.
