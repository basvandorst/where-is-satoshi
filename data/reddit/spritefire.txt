This is a very real concern, and I will explain why (and will probably get downvoted).
Essentialy cryptocurrencies (aside from NFTs), are competing against fiat. Corporations, banks and other entities are now starting to take all of the benefits the tech of Blockchain brings and applying those same technologies to fiat, after all at the end of the day, fiat is just a number. It also has the advantage of having the connection from merchants everywhere to purchases, and even has optional private transactions via paper wallets (giving a friend a $10 note).
Secondly, when any CryptoCurrency is purchased via fiat. If that fiat is not destroyed (and I do not see any crypto seller doing this) then crypto has not replaced fiat. Fiat is still used and the circulation has not decreased. In fact the CryptoCurrency seller will then use that fiat to make other purchases.
Thirdly, the cost of using the tech and speed of the tech rules out a lot of the use cases that alts are flagging as their primary use. Want to store millions of records a day ie web analytics.. cost valuing the tech against other technologies at its current cost rate is stifling adoption of the tech, unless they remove the currency side of it and just use blockchain itself as a tech like what IBM offer (the tech that doesn't require CryptoCurrency).

People hate on Bitcoin until their work starts paying them on Fridays and it doesn't drop into their account on Tuesday because banks choose not to work on weekends, and they long for something better.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:56:34
People will be buying/selling with bigger fractions of one coin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:22:53
Binance is just letting a few others get in on the ride too at a discount price.. because for everyone cashing out, someone else is buying in.

You should definitely sell if you cant be bothered to read the article. Basically people in Korea will need IDs to set up trading accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:28:44
No. There will be a ban opening anonymous accounts for trading. Almost everyone I know has already had to use ID to open an account for trading.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:25
It will go back up. 
You'll find that this market always has it's ups and downs.

People seem to forget, for every bitcoin sold, someone else had to buy that coin.

Look into SWIFT and its links with terrorism and crime, it's what all of the banks use for their transactions. It makes Bitcoin look like the nerdy nice girl in comparison.

That bitcoin you sell, has to be bought for it to be sold.

They are not banning the exchanges. People who dont research properly should'nt be investing, and are one of the reasons that cause prices to drop.

This news has been around for a week or so on the Ripple subreddit and no one cared and prices didnt budge a bit. Im thinking this current dip is the same as the ones as the past few days, it will go back up, back down, back up etc.

From the front page: Breaking down the FUD: A Closer look at Recent Korean News
I am doing this again, because I hate seeing people get fooled over and over by these horrible news articles that are obviously preying on misconceptions by people in other cultures.
So I am here to break down exactly what the recent Rueters article is trying to do to people who don’t understand how the Korean banking system works.
Now, before I moved to Korea, I too was naïve about their banking practices. If I saw an article saying “The steps will include a ban on opening anonymous cryptocurrency accounts and new legislation to allow regulators to close virtual coin exchanges if needed” I too would be confused by misunderstanding.
But, what exactly does this mean? Opening cryptocurrency bank accounts? How does that happen in Korea? In America, I only have 1 bank account. Maybe two. And how do I open one anonymously? 
What Reuters is doing, and it knows it, is failing to explain Korean banking systems in general.
So, in Korea, it is very common for businesses to open temporary bank accounts for customers. These are called “virtual bank accounts.” They are not real or tied to any specific name. “Virtual” (this is important to understand) Often, these bank accounts are open for only 24 hours, and they are anonymous. People can go to the ATM, transfer the exact amount to that account, and pay for items online. Even Gmarket allows users to do this. It is another, easy way to pay for things securely, online.
Now, Bithumb allows this as an option (one of several) in order to deposit Won into their website. These bank accounts are generated on the spot, and are only open for 3 hours. In that span, you can go to an ATM, send your Won to your anonymously generated bank account, and it will show up on Bithumb. You can also issue a “virtual” account that is linked to your actual bank account, and takes additional verification processes. 
I am not sure how Korbit/Bithumb do this, but I do have a “virtual account” with them, but it is linked directly to my name, which matches exactly with my already submitted government id. I would assume that Korbit/Bithumb are already taking these measures, and have been. It could also be that the government wants to get rid of virtual accounts entirely, but I would imagine, as long as it is not anonymous, they will keep on issuing accounts. 
And even if these “virtual” accounts, which are not anonymous, are banned, Bithumb and Korbit will start using a system similar to Coinbase.
Here are some images to show you how these accounts are handled at Bithumb: 
I will say this: I had a more difficult time signing up with Bithumb than I did on Coinbase, and this was before any regulation was even mentioned in Korea. Speaking for Bithumb, I can assure you, they plan to follow every regulation, and may already have the necessary information to comply. 
I can not make a virtual account anonymously. It must match my gov. id name, which Bithumb has a record of.
I can not deposit money unless it comes from a bank account registered in my name. I even had to submit a copy of the ATM receipt which matched the date and time of my deposit.
Bithumb has copies of my government identification and my passport. When I withdraw into a bank account, that account must match the same name on these documents, or my deposit will not work.
Based on this new FUD, Bithumb, and most likely UpBit and Korbit are already following these regulations completely. 
Now, let’s drop the FUD ridden, 2 paragraph Reuters article, and look at some MUCH more informed pieces about this news, from Korean sources.
1.)	
Notice how this short article spells out clearly the regulations and ends by stating exactly won’t be affected by it. “only real-name bank accounts and matching accounts at virtual currency exchanges can be used for deposits and withdrawals, while the issuance of new virtual accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges will be banned.” So, “virtual” accounts, which are what I described above, is clearly what is being regulated. And they must match the “real name” of the users. 
And we have people here claiming that no one in Korea can make a new account on any exchanges. And then they go on to say Korea is starting to shut exchanges down too.
The Korean government is saying that, IF exchanges don’t comply, they will begin enforcing it and shutting them down. They will start looking to make sure that places like Bithumb are no longer issuing virtual accounts, and requiring real-name bank accounts on their platform. Bithumb will comply. Korbit will comply. UpBit will comply. They will compete to comply quicker. These regulations are no different than what Coinbase went through. 
2.)	
Another Korean source which is also very clear on what the government said. It clearly states that exchanges won’t be issued “virtual” bank accounts anymore, and it will need to move to an “actual name” system. New customers must register with their actual bank accounts. It then goes a step further and explains why, stating that it would be more difficult to trace any money laundering if a temporary account was used to buy crypto.
I am not here to argue whether this is good or bad. But we have people on this sub-reddit who simply don’t understand what “banning new virtual accounts” means. And Reuters did not do it’s diligence, like the other articles I posted here, in explaining what “virtual account” means. And they know it. 
Stop being fooled!

I figure because around that time the price of the halving got baked into its value as there was a lot of talk around that at the time. I'm just hoping that it maintains that doubled value instead of going in the other direction. I'm trying to remain hopeful.. just need some kind of new breakthrough that is bigger than the hope we all held in Dec '17.. and not news of stable coins which defeat the variable discrepancies that merchants fear.

I think it will go red, and red again for a bit longer. More money can be made when btc is oscilating at lower value, also a lot of ICO's had written agreements that they wouldnt touch any of the funds for 12 months. It ia hitting that mark now so a lot will be caahing out so they can provide salaries and r&amp;d for another 12 months otherwise if they leave it too late and they are the last to cash out they might not make it through the year. 
This is just random observations though. No one can guarentew facts, just speculate based upon what can be assumed.
