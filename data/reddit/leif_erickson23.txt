same for ETH?

wasn't there an ICO?

The castration which was forced onto him was a chemical one, not a mechanical one, but yes.
He died of suicide by depression two years later.

I know a guy who bought at $200, went on with his life, got an internationally published scientist, and sold half near ATH.
That guy made it so much better than myself, even though I bought much earlier. But I did spent the BTC on stuff....

Would you care to show the math for education? What's the difficulty atm?

They asked everybody to implement their coins if interested..
Other BTC fork implemented is ZEC, at least its transparent side.

The OpenBazaar devs were BTC maximalists initially, but opened to alts when BTC fee was so high that there was no traffic on OpenBazaar anymore. They integrated Bitmain Cash to offer alternatives, which BCH was the easiest to implement, since it is a BTC fork.
Don't take them for BCH supporters.

Last time I talked to him he wasn't, but that was quite some time ago. Don't know about today.

North Korea doesn't even have free flea markets, I doubt they have a crypto exchange...

If you need the book in PDF instead of asciidoc, you can export it from asciidoc to HTML with `asciidoctor`, and from there to PDF with `wkhtmltopdf` (web kit HTML to PDF), btw. (asciidoctor-pdf breaks for me)

Is the 'functional marketplace' open to use for everybody now? Because I remember it being '90% ready' ~2 years ago, yet nobody got to see it back then...
@_date: 2018-10-03 08:07:40
Then DYOR and realize the devs are promising the decentralized marketplace for years now, before PART it was the same with SDC, same promises. And before SDC they abandoned yet another project..
Edit: Just to be clear, I didn't claim they are not building it, I am sure they are trying at least. Just telling you the experience people made with the team in their former projects, and that was the last time I have read their code back then.
Take this hint or leave it, I won't waste time dicussing with moonbois so emotionally attached to their investment that they can't realistically judge their own project and the competition (OpenBazaar, BitBay, SysCoin etc have decentralized marketplaces for years already).

Ok, if you say so..


Ages go fast in crypto. If you remember the SDC times, you remember the "nearly ready functional marketplace" back then?


So BitBay and the SysCoin marketplace are not?
OpenBazaar might not write the offers into the blockchain, but that approach has shown as not great for vendors.


They have new devs now? Because when I checked the SDC codebase I got goosebumps...


"Latest BTC codebase", yeah, I remember that slogan... Back then it actually was horribly outdated...


Without knowing what they did this time, 'unique' encryption doesn't sound as good as you hope it does.
Maybe you are right and everything is better today! Maybe everything changed! But I won't touch the project again, even if only to spent time on the code again. I guess every generation has to do its own experiences, mistakes included...
I know all critical voices are just FUD, because there is just FUD and great news. I know the community is "great" and everything, I am not here to rob you of that.

There are problems with hardware wallets too.
Best thing is to use the native wallets and compile them yourself. That's much more work than using those one-for-all wallets of course.

nobody cares bro, if you have to brag about it, you're poor.
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:37:34
You wish!
In can already hear the _that was not "real" socialism!_
True, it wasn't the utopia, just real socialism.
People forget after a few generations, and will try again.
Maybe, in the future, brain implants can save us from being a selfish animal named _homo sapiens sapiens_; I am sure there will be a borg-like fraction.

Can everybody stake NANO?

Bullshit, the US can't stop ICBMs and they know it. Why are you afraid of North Korea if you could?

The Russians have enough A bombs to kill everybody too, so the Rubel is a great currency??
