I've no idea if that's the case here, but there have been exploitable bugs in image libraries before. These typically allow attackers to craft images that cause a buffer overrun with code injection when the image is decoded for viewing.
[This one]( was huge in its day.
Bugs are [regularly discovered in libpng](
A different issue: People also [hide malware in EXIF headers](

I think it was pretty predictable that this was going to happen. It's like a more expensive version of e-mail spam, and we have plenty of options for dealing with it.

This is not entirely correct, and the comment you link to says as much. The primary motivator was that if the developers had added the cap, doge would be a) forked and b) mined out this year.
The ~33% dilution rate of Litecoin would make pretty much every profit-minded miner jump ship, leaving Dogecoin with a critically low network hashrate. This would open it up to attacks and effectively kill it.

Respect. I'm my family's tech support guy too, and I never throw perfectly good stuff away. There's always someone who can use it.

I was simply comparing some of Bitcoin's main news stories with some of Doge's. You went there :)

To be fair, Bitcoin is also going through an extreme inflationary phase (still at 10% or so, though it used to be much more), and that hasn't stopped it from gaining value.

I don't know how imgur process their images, but it's not obvious to me that images hosted there don't potentially contain exploits. Telling benign data files from malicious ones is certainly not a trivial task -- virus scanners can only find a subset of well-known "cookie-cutter" threats.
I agree it's a very remote possibility in this specific case, but it pays to be aware and not access your cold storage from your daily use OS.

It's a good point that seems to be lost on the inflation critics. They bought in knowing (hopefully) that the inflation is currently 1-2% *daily*.
In light of that, and the fact that it's being mined continuously by multipools, it's pretty amazing that the price has been holding up as well as it has. I wonder where it'll go after a halving or two.

There's a demand side of the equation too. The reason Bitcoins gained in value is that demand outpaced supply. The same could be true for Doge. TBH, a 5% supply increase next year could be too little to prevent a price bubble.
If inflation were the only concern, the dollar would actually be a better store of value than both Bitcoins and Doge right now. And you'd get interest on it too :)

I disagree with your argument that the listed activities are "dodgy as fuck".


Yes, heaven forbid someone gets publicity for charitable donations and not funneling money to criminal networks.
The business world has always understood that publicity for charity is a win-win. A lot of Dogecoin holders do too, but many also donate out of the goodness of their hearts. There have been several successful but less publicised donation efforts.


He was being mistaken for an official Dogecoin Foundation source, and was also posting some rather antagonistic articles belittling Litecoin and Bitcoin. The reaction is perfectly understandable IMO.

First off, they didn't change anything. They simply chose to ignore petitions to put in a cap and drop rewards to zero by the end of this year. Obviously that would have been a bad idea.
Second, the inflation is moderate -- it's [below bitcoin's inflation rate until 2017 and litecoin's until 2020](
As a dogecoin (and btc) holder, I'm glad to see that most of the responses here avoid rising to the obvious bait in the title. I've always found subscribers to be mostly thoughtful and on the non-knee-jerk end of the spectrum.
Cheers!
