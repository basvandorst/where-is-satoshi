Thank you for specifying. Do we know if the government has determined what they will define as a crypto asset vs security vs commodity?

Makes sense. I was just more curious to know how they will be handling coins and ICOs in the future that are backed by physical assets. I mean how will they categorize and this regulate them. I’ve heard some talk that some altcoins are considered currencies while others may be considered securities if they are tied to physical assets. For example REAL from my understanding is backed by physical real estate , and depending on the rental income of those assets, payouts are given to coin holders. 
If a company is doing an ICO but they are deemed to be a security, I understand there are a lot more red tape to go through than simply being labeled as a currency or commodity.
