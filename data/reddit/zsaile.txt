Seems like your questions could probably be answered by watching a 20 minute YouTube video about 'whats is Bitcoin and how does it 'work'. A wallet is secure as the machine you store it on, and the password you use to secure it.

Just like any investment there are upsides and down sides. Would you also say no one should buy Tesla or Netflix stock because there is a potential downside? People weigh the risk vs reward, and make the choice which works for them.

Do you think they pay you interest because they are keeping your money safe in a encrypted wallet? Most likely they are using your money to make money for themselves and paying you a small portion of it. One day they will make a bad investment and lose all your money.

Banks only insure your money to a degree. If the bank goes out of business you could lose you money. 
For example in Canada the government insures your deposits up to $100,000 but if you have $500,000 in the bank and they go bankrupt, you will only get back 1/5. There are 5 big banks in Canada, if one of them went under I am not convinced the government could handle payout out 100,000 to so many people. 
Ask people in Greece how secure their money is in the bank? When the currency drops in value and they lock you in and say you can only take our €50 a day. Not a fun situation to be in either. At least Bitcoin is liquid, and easy to sell when you want. You always maintain control over your asset.
I agree, Bitcoin isn't a great investment, imho, but i see why many people do like it. 
Yes, a subreddit dedicated to Bitcoin is going to obviously be pro-bitcoin. Diversify your research and come to your own conclusion. Personally I don't like speculative buys, so I don't do any Bitcoin purchasing.

Is it not obvious now that you should not keep any coins in an exchange? Put money in you want to convert, make the conversion, and take it out.
I don't understand why people keep money in the exchange and then are shocked they lose it. Obviously some people will get caught up if they are in the middle of a transaction when the exchange goes under, but that would be a tiny portion.

Does your CC price protection work on steam games? If you bought a game last week, and it got 75% off today, with your CC honour that?

I have not paid a fee on my bank accounts in 5 years(switched to a free online bank). My savings pay 1.75%. Mind you I keep very little of my net worth in cash anyway. you guys need to find some better banks. Or maybe Canadian banks don't suck as bad...

First rule of investing. Diversify. You ignored the rule, and now you pay the price. Welcome to investing.
