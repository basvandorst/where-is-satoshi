if you’re using the same wallet software and it creates a new receive address on every request, you still hold the key to the previous address. you will still receive the coin just fine. i wouldn’t worry about it

i would agree if the content of r/btc was about btc. 90% is about bch though. Why not put it under r/bch ?
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:42:49
right now if you want to support segwit, which will help scale bitcoin a little and want to take advantage of future innovations like schnorr signatures, MAST and lightning network (can take years to build), I would choose segwit, but either choice is fine

i think btc is sybil resistant. these nodes will be segmented
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:52:23
bitbodes only counts public nodes (i.e nodes it can connect to through an exposed port) . in reality there are 10x more nodes (estimated) alive behind firewalls etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:47:07
I would guess btc3 or something of the sort alas.
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:22:16
a btc satoshi is worth more than a bch satoshi. looking at fork.lol fee per transaction in satoshis, btc fees are not that much higher than bch.
this is the downside of having such a heavily priced asset. imagine how much a btc tx fee pegged against us dollar will become when btc becomes 50k a coin. this can be fixed with 2nd layer solutions like lightning network (which bch will never support)
comparing bch fee vs btc fee is not a fair comparison imho
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:25:11
that’s a pretty accurate assessment of how the interview went. I was quite shocked to hear Roger calling bitcoin cash his product/project. Solidifying our assumption, that he really wants to own the bitcoin brand. Well written, good stuff!

@_date: 2017-11-06 00:00:48
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:19:36
keep your core nodes up. it will prefer to connect to other  like minded peers and reject bad rep nodes. hopefully these btc1 clients will get segmented
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:24:18
i wouldn’t say ponzi. as it needs a multi layered pyramid model, where the lowest level keeps feeding the top layer. it does look more and more like the greater fool theory though. 
The question is, who is the greater fool?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:32:52
I heard one of the core devs are changing the PoW of BTC should s2x “win”, which i think is a bad idea imo.
I saw a similar proposal by luke. I hope it doesn’t come to this
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:56:14
i doubt it. greenaddress is owned by blockstream a no2x company. get a nano s hardware wallet. it supports all chains and it will split btc and b2x for you post fork. 
or this company will split it for you as well 
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:27:13
from what i gather these wallets will support B2X splitting
breadwallet (so you don’t have to move your coins)
nano ledger S (hardware wallet)
coinbase (web and app)
btc.com (app)
blockchain.info (web and app) 
or put your coins on exchanges which will split it for you but it’s more risky. bitfinex for instance
there is also an online service which does this for you  not active yet. even more risky :-p
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:38:43
if you have your coins stored in a wallet with a splitting service built in to it (as this fork does not have replay protection), you will get the equivalent amount of coins pre fork on both chains. mind you one coin will be worth less than the other. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:12:29
bch has an upcoming hard fork. if everybody upgrades there won’t be a split. it’s just an upgrade. the binaries are already available. the hardfork will activate on 13 nov. it’s a fix to the EDA. Pretty much all the volume comes from Korea though .. weird.. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:02:40
great looking app!. will move some of my coins there once segwit support is released :-)
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:52:21
will this come with segwit tx out of the box?
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:44:06
hmm just saw they deleted the optin replay protection on github. Apparently they are discussing another method on their slack. We might get a stronger replay protection before the fork after all?

bitcoin gold, is another bitcoin fork set to take place at the 25th of October.
it’s a friendly fork since it uses zcashes PoW not sha256 like bitcoin, unlike a malicious fork which can disrupt the network like B2X.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:47:13
from what i’m seeing, businesses like wallets, even online ones are building replay protection for s2x. i wouldn’t stress about it. that’s what i meant why btc will become stronger because of this. The whole btc ecosystem is working together to make it stronger.

Emergent Consensus, was the alternative version of bitcoin made by the anti core people, aka Bitcoin Unlimited. It was supposed to give miners more control of the block size limit on the blockchain, where they can configure their clients to make bigger blocks if they wish. This was from back in the day when segwit wasn’t even activated yet. I think EC eventually forked off to become bcash. it’s dead in the water now.

@_date: 2017-10-11 19:51:10
Roger will go all in to bch he said
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:11:49
they copy paste 99% of core code and put some hacks in it to make it work like they want it to. All the hard work is done by the bitcoin core developers
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:38:02
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:30:37
ultimately the market will decide. Looking at Bitcoin Cash, miners leave bch as soon as btc is more profitable to mine and vice versa (although not to the same extent). The same can be said about segwit2x. 
Another reason is, right now the dominant node count in the btc network topology is the one from core (around 9000 public core nodes  
which represent only 10% of the total fully validating core nodes according to
 and
one from Jameson Lopp 
(most nodes are behind fire walls etc). Albeit these private nodes can’t accept incoming connections, they can still relay and validate blocks.
whereas the segwit2x nodes AFAIK is pretty much still non existent.
From what I understand, core nodes starting from version 0.13.x and up, are designed to keep the current network topology intact. So it will only connect to known peers, which have behaved nicely and have the most reliable uptime. 
Even if a company would fire up 100k segwit2x nodes (aka a sybil attack) the btc network will probably just ignore them. Btc is quite good at this.
This means segwit2x miners will mine invalid blocks resulting in a loss of block reward / income.
But at the end of the day, as said the market will decide and I will act accordingly. The reasons I mentioned were just geeky techno babble for most and I doubt the majority of investors care about it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:00:37

@_date: 2017-10-11 17:26:42
i guess some hard/software wallets will split it for you post fork. I’m using ledger myself. but i heard bread wallet will also split it for you when the time comes. I wouldn’t be in any hurry to split it though. wait a couple of weeks until the dust settles
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:01:18
i think I had a similar dream. I dreamt I was a midget mining bitcoin in a cave, and I remembered really having to pee. so I went in to one of those minecarts and did it there (in the dream). I woke up and discovered I pissed myself.

@_date: 2017-10-07 16:46:41
there is coin.dance/poli, but i wouldn’t trust it. intent is different than action. it’s a game of chicken at this moment i’m afraid. please keep your coins in a wallet where you own the private keys. like exodus, core wallet or some lite wallet like electrum. version 3 of electrum will have full segwit address support (not out yet at the time of this writing). I’m personally looking forward to that last one.

the PSA of bitcoin.com
Public Service Announcement
Bitcoin.com Statement on Bitcoin Cash (BCC)
As we have previously stated, Bitcoin.com believes that behaving with integrity and upholding agreements made is always the proper course of action. As such, we continue to remain committed to supporting the Segwit2x proposal, which has received broad support from Bitcoin industry and community alike.
Due to significant demand from our users, the Bitcoin.com Pool will give mining customers the option of supporting the Bitcoin Cash chain (BCC) with their hashrate, but otherwise Bitcoin.com Pool will by default remain pointed at the chain supporting Segwit2x (BTC).
We trust that our fellow community members will also behave with integrity and uphold agreements made, but in the unlikely event that the 2MB block size increase portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, Bitcoin.com will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:11:31
true. but if the other chain is a 1000 bucks a coin, i personally wouldn’t let it go

i’m using it until electrum comes out with segwit addresses, which should be shortly 
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:41:41
i don’t know how they did it. ledger split my bch and btc practically automatically and i did a one off transaction to an exchange to dump my bch. they might do the same with s2x .. put it on different addresses on both chains first with different nlocktimes depending on blockheights of both chains (which should be different on the 2 chains depending on block creation speed) all this under the hood.Users don’t need to worry about it. but like i said i’m in no hurry to split the coins until it’s totally safe.
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:56:29
it’s been going up consistently 1 % daily lately without the popular wallets out yet. let’s hope for a parabolic increase when electrum and core 0.15.1 are released.

@_date: 2017-10-11 17:36:20
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:54:23
I don't think so. The difficulty would be super high at the start of the fork, due to lack of hashing power (should B2X get the majority hashrate), making the mining unprofitable for a while. The difficulty would adjust accordingly after 2016 blocks (around 2 weeks). After a while (if the majority haven't switch back), your miner will be at level playing field with your competition due to the lower difficulty.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:21:18
personally I don’t care about replay protection. I think if btc can withstand splits without it, it’s another testament of how strong btc is
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:53:09
imo segwit2x will be another test to see how resilient and uncompromising btc is. Another enemy to slay as a rites of passage to become the ultimate king of crypto currencies. it has done so in the past and it will do so now and in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:09:13

this is their website  not much on it. no software wallet. it’s not hard but you will need to get a wallet on your computer like electrum so you have control of your private keys and withdraw your funds from bitrex to electrum. with electrum you can export your private keys and import it to the upcoming bitcoin gold wallet. before doing this move your btc to another address POST fork for safety first, your private key will be exposed and better to do this with an empty btc wallet. since you only moved your  coins on the btc chain, the btcgpu coins are still available on their chain. 
import your private keys to the bgpu wallet and you have access to you bgpu. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:37:07

free money. sold it too. I will do the same with b2x and bgold.. keep the divs coming :-)
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:43:00
it’s where the chain forks off to another branch. This is ok and can happen some times. By design if the new chain is a minority chain, it will be destroyed and reorganized to the main chain. But what i was talking about is actually a split. this is where the blockchain splits into a new alt coin like bitcoin cash and segwit2x at a certain block height (every block has an id linking a block to the previous block, this is also called a block height). since the block creation time is usually around a block every 10 minutes, you can roughly estimate when the split is going to happen. in case of segwit2x around 18-20 Nov. at least that’s my understanding of it. feel free to correct me if i’m wrong
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:31:24
miners will mine the most profitable coin. some are already showing some support to mine both forks (btc and bt2x). we’re gaining more ground day by day. I guess we will have to wait and see which chain shall win.. my advice is not to move your coins in november until the dust settles. or if you can’t handle the risk, sell all your coins in November and come back in when there’s a clear winner 
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:42:29
there is an optin replay protection for B2X
I will do it once there are automatic tools for it. I expect the ledger hw wallet to do it for you like it did for bch.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:25:08
bitcoin gold might be worth nothing. who knows. there’s no wallet for it yet afaik. the split is on october the 25th. plenty of time to move your btc to a local wallet
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:47:12
probably, unless the bitcoin gold is worth a lot (highly doubt it) and customers are complaining, they might consider enabling withdrawals of the split coin. I don’t know what the policy is on bittrex.. maybe send their support an email?

the debug option in the main menu. and look for peers. if it’s not signaling “Satoshi 0.x.x” where x is the version number i.e 0.15.0.1. it’s not a core node and you can right click it and ban it. but the core client does this automatically if i’m not mistaken
EDIT: it does not disconnect automatically because segwit2x can run in stealth mode.
there is a script however which does this for you
