Yes, there are dozens of other exchanges, but what I don't understand is why noone seems to be really concerned that other "established" systems eg. Btc-e and bitfinex also failed in the crash.

So does yours have any fees? What's the rate based on?

I think we need to keep in perspective that the report is talking about the fx on the scale of the USD. It would take an *immense* amount of support and adoption for bitcoin to achieve the scale of USD. In the report, even the currency of a sovereign country with 1mil+ users (Mauritius) is small potatoes. In fact, Mauritian rupees are probably insignificant to you too.
Paypal and visa offer more than the bitcoin network does - they also offer protection and fx services (imagine instant BTC-&gt;fiat conversion)! That's not something that bitcoin, or any currency, offers.

Thank you for this. I thought I was going nuts at all the negative reactions to what I thought was a positive, insightful and objective report outlining the hurdles bitcoin has to face before it could ever be a viable contender to fiat on the scale of USD, JPY or CNY.
I skimmed through the article and went straight to the report as the article is taking his words out of context.
This guy is writing from the perspective of an institutional fx trader writing to an audience of investors.
In fact, it's right there on the first page of the report -




The *current* situation of immense volatility, terrible liquidity and lack of central authority/guarantee of value, **does** make bitcoin horribly inferior to leading fiat currencies for companies and investors.
Bitcoin is currently a *commodity*, not a *currency*. Any company that reported or dealt solely in bitcoin would've experienced a 40% drop in revenues within the past 3 months. That company would be *insane* to use bitcoin as a currency.
Frankly, people who put money into bitcoin are speculating, not investing, and you aren't the audience this note is targeted at.

of course I could. Like I mentioned, I could also use any number of other methods to hedge against forex risk, if I didn't mind the number of hoops I'd have to jump through in the process. The thing is, *why should I have to*, if I could get it in the form of something that is both a stable store of value, and easy to spend? Do keep in mind that I believe this works **only** if the volatility of Bitcoin comes down.


if your concern is the digital security bit, I agree with you, as it's too complicated now to keep your coins safe. Doesn't mean there's no way there'll be better methods in the future though.


Maybe not, but why should we be ok with this, when there could exist a more convenient alternative?

well, he currently has negative karma, so I suppose he's banned himself.

??? isn't this incident an argument **for** regulation &amp; centralization?

You assume that the value of fiat is stable.
The value of the USD/EUR against many Asian currencies (CNY/SGD/JPY until Abe) has tumbled by 20-30% in the last 5 years. Including the effect of high inflation, the value of my USD/EUR in Asia is far lower now than it was then.
**If** the volatility of Bitcoin ever comes down to reasonable levels, I see a lot of value in being able to buy and hold Bitcoin for use internationally, and not have to worry about finding a money changer / atm, the possibility of card skimming, the forex risk if I worked overseas and were paid in a different currency, etc. Of course, there are ways around these problems now, and Bitcoin has its own attendant problems as well, but that's not to say it's *entirely* pointless.
It's certainly far more convenient than attempting to buy some gold and barter it for goods in every country you visit.
In fact, I would personally be far more convinced of the utility of Bitcoin as a currency if its value were pegged to a basket of commodities.

5% and spot price? Why use this when there's  ?
Unless these people are really concerned about privacy....

So they just "found" $120mil worth of btc. Either a huge scam, or their incompetence is **beyond** ridiculous.

While everyone who understands the subject realizes all the figures are unreliable, due to intentional manipulation or as a matter of normal account management, they seem to be an intrinsic part of Wikipedia's coverage on cryptocurrencies. 


Please read the discussion, and support your point on Wikipedia if you feel that the page should be retained. If you can get reliable Chinese sources, that may be your best shot.
