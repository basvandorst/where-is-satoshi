I said the 2nd part of the title is imo based on the news
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:35:22
I think he’s saying bitcoin doesn’t produce anything as in like a company like Apple produces tablets, phones, computers etc
Bitcoin doesn’t produce anything so the only thing you have to rely on is people paying more for bitcoin than you did
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:24:28
I’m expecting the decline to continue as the cost of mining is higher than the value of bitcoin, which means less people wanting to mine
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:39:13
Banks produce loans, branches, atm’s and cards
They also offer services such as stock trading etc
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:38:23
Yes but the companies earn something which adds to how it’s valued
@_date: 2018-05-06 00:37:51
Not the company, just some people that worked there that no longer work there
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:53:41
Nothing they are just an investment company, but they are invested in companies that produce
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:04:42
1st part of the title is fact, 2nd part is imo based on the fact
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:41:42
I agree, and you have trust that 1% to keep the value up. Guess what happens if that 1% decides they don’t want bitcoin anymore

I think Wells Fargo was actually one of the Bank’s that didn’t need a bailout but they still got it anyway
Wells Fargo was rescuing/buying other banks during the crisis, Wachovia being one that it bought
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:52:17
Nope buffet doesn’t like gold either
@_date: 2018-05-08 03:46:42
You think Apple would be worth what it was if it only made 100.00$ a year?
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:32:05
As long as the value of bitcoin doesn’t drop with it, even if it becomes easier, less value in bitcoin will cancel out the easier difficulty
If bitcoin value didn’t decline along with it then there’s chance it could be fine
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:03:24
It’s passed on to share holders by dividends and higher stock price
Which comes from the things they produce which people use or buy
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:55:42
This is actually big news, it means bitcoin never got to 19k on its own, which could also mean it may never get there again
I feel sorry for the people that bought this at 15k-19k, I tried to warn people multiple times
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:48:20
If it wasn’t manipulated up they never would have had the option to buy it at 19k
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:58:30
There’s still trust required with bitcoin, you have to trust that all bitcoin investors will keep the price up
I rather have my bank to be closed for a few days than some bitcoin whale drop the value of my savings down to 0 at any moment
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:33:17
There’s always going to be debt so how would debt work with digital currency?
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:27:34
Ok if there was a global debt forgiveness that solves that, I doubt this though
What about all the people that saved for retirement?
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:01:50
I did a search and can’t find one with my specific title, I’m not looking through every thread for my specific question
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:29:12
In order for there to be an equal swap that wouldn’t cause disruption bitcoins value would have to be equal or greater than all other currencies combined correct? Not 100% sure how swapping works
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:10:21
What makes you so certain that digital can’t fade to 0? It’s been practically worth 0 until 3 years ago. You think just because people finally noticed it that it can never drop again?
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:37:25
Why would anyone want something not backed by anything that could be replaced at anytime be the only currency?
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:49:25
So your saying a world wide collapse is the only way it could become a single currency, are we sure bitcoin would still be worth something in such an event? Wouldn’t gold, silver, gems be most likely thing to still be worth something in this event?
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:43:52
The whales can take it from you, remember that drop from 19,000 to 6,000? That was just one whale selling. Watch what happens when more than one sells
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:42:50
With dollars, the stocks of companies are valued in dollars
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:51:00
Gradually? I see people trying to say single currency in 5 - 10 years
And if it only did most transactions instead of all transactions it would still hurt the value of other currencies by a lot which still poses a problem to the 2 reasons I posted
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:49:24
With digital you would have to trust the whole world for the currency to keep its value, atleast with fiat less trust is required
Trusting the whole world vs trusting 1 location or government
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:20:45
I agree with that but what’s your opinion on my post
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:54:01
What happens if they don’t pay it back compared to regular currency
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:50:36
The usd isn’t decentralized, so it’s controlled and backed by the government right? They decide how much is printed or not printed, their control over it is a big part of its valuation
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:59:40
If a collapse is big enough you think electricity would be widely avaible for everyone to use in order for them to use bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:10:45
What about the debt that’s already in place with the currencies we have now or people’s savings, in my original post
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:26:05
I can’t wait for the bitcoin people to get wrecked when a couple whales decide to sell off
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:06:05
Apple also has almost 300 billion $ which is a big part of their valuation
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:33:09
You have no freedom your putting your money into the trust of bitcoin whales,
Anything can go to 0 doesn’t matter what it is
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:58:54
People have posted this before? Well what’s your argument against what I posted?
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:54:34
It’s valuation is decided by the whole world though
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:24:16
If there was a sudden collapse and the dollar was gone, 99% of companies would be out of business, therefore with stock valuations of 0
They would have to start over with bitcoin as a foundation to get back in business
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:19:02
World wide but also the backing of whatever government is in its valuation and the things that government does to increase or devalue their currency
While with bitcoin it has no backing so it’s value is completely decided by the people that own it or trade it, so now you have to put all your trust in those people that decide it’s value instead of just 1 government
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:53:42
The governments debt right?
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:34:52
Since bitcoin is decentralized and not backed by anyone it will always be vulnerable to being replaced by a new popular digital currency
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:05:27
What was your opinion of the original post? You only responded to another comment
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:45:32
Yes but how is it going to handle any type of debt, loans etc
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:07:13
So how could you trust something like this if they can do things like this?
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:30:33
What’s going to stop digital currencies from being replaced all the time by just more digital currencies?
Say bitcoin becomes the one currency, then someone makes a new digital currency 20 years later that everyone thinks is better then bitcoin and bitcoin is wiped out, so people’s investments and savings and debt just keep getting wiped out with every new popular digtal currency
