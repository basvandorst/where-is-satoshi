I wasn't saying the attack was impossible, just that it involved quite a bit of complications (for example, your [1] actually has a lot of sweat associated to it: can the attacker sell that gold easily? gow does he/she protect him/herself against gold price fluctuation? he/she will amass a lot of gold to get a win, what's the logistics behind that? etc.).
All of which comes back to the cost of the attack.

There are very little absolutes, even after confirmations, just levels of risk.
A double spend issued an hour later is highly unlikely to make it into any miner's pool. So the risk I think you're referring to is a miner choosing to include a double-spend in a block an hour after the original transaction (assumingly accepted by then). We've found very little evidence of that for "regular" transactions (i.e. outside of satoshi dice malarkey). Miners (including you) are overall honest and a dishonest miner would have more to lose than the value of his/her double spend.
@_date: 2015-06-26 05:42:25
What does a miner has to win by adopting strict RBF? Hopefully very little. A few occasional transactions will just have slightly higher fees. Under full scorched earth scenario though, where consuming the transaction is commonplace, the miner could earn much more. But transacting bitcoin could become much harder as any payment can escalate to nothingness. What's the impact of that on bitcoin price and miner revenue? Your bet is as good as mine, but I'd go downward.
Now further on the losing side, on full RBF a lot of people won't be able to accept unconfirmed transactions anymore. Many use cases will get wiped out. And what for? Just to prove the point that unconfirmed transactions can't be secured 100% of the time? Confirmed transactions can't either.
As for an attacker, revealing his attack by trying a double spend is unlikely to be the most beneficial way to leverage the compromise.
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:05:51
That would be a very expensive attack to pull off. Not only because of all the transactions you would have to issue but also because of the effect on your reputation as a mining pool owning 20% hashrate (no single miner owns that much).
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:58:04
A dishonest miner with 30% hashing power can mess with a lot of other assumptions in bitcoin. And would have much more to lose by doing so than what he/she would gain by moving the price on vaultoro.
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:59:16
If full RBF gets adopted, several people will have to go back to the drawing board, starting with Coinbase. If you listen to all the "what ifs", you'll never build anything.
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:44:20
Thanks! And what you describe is called "replace by fee", very unlikely to be adopted in the generic case but there are interesting particular cases that would still remain compatible with the current "first seen" system.
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:11:17
And what would be your estimation on that? Any numbers?
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:07:26
Mmmh no. I'm BlockCypher's cofounder and we did write the article. ZapChain just found it interesting and relayed it, that's all.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:57:31
Had that discussion with Chris from HashRabbit some time ago. The implementation isn't necessarily that simple as pools rely on more than just the nonce to add more entropy (ever wondered why block times could get so out of whack?) but still, publishing total shares wouldn't be rocket science.
So totally with you here. The issue is much more a lack of willingness and transparency than any technicality.
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:06:05
From the article:
"BlockCypher’s new features allow merchants and other Bitcoin applications to assess, within milliseconds, the actual risk incurred of processing a transaction almost immediately rather than waiting for its confirmation by the block chain.
For example, if BlockCypher returns a confidence factor of 99.99%, the probability of the transaction getting confirmed by the block chain is almost certain. If we return a confidence factor of 95%, the merchant can weigh whether or not to process the transaction immediately or wait a few seconds more for the confidence factor to go up (within 10 seconds, BlockCypher typically returns a confidence factor close to 99.9%)."
The confirmation time can't be decreased but what can be done is give a confidence factor that the transaction will almost certainly make it into a block without any issue.

Try something like this:
Replace the address with any address that you'd like. The [BlockCypher web services]( have all sorts of useful tools you can program against.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:20:38
There's no reason for off-blockchain transactions to exist. They undermine the developing infrastructure around blockchains and cryptocurrencies. This is a [premature optimization]( due to the current Bitcoin software having been optimized for desktop environments and not large scale. Exchanges should either develop their own parallel blockchains or build software that can match the scale they need. The volumes are still tiny compared to existing networks.
I'll use the common parallel with Internet. We're still at the stage where people used to run their own small sites on personal computers and the whole Internet is just a few tens of thousand of people. From there, it went to Geocities, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Wordpess, Tumblr, AWS, etc. The Apache server was a huge step in that direction.
Bitcoin and crypto-currencies need to evolve in that same direction. Does that mean more centralization? A little bit. But Internet is still largely decentralized (except for a couple protocol mistakes like DNS).

Miners could also mine empty blocks. Or only the transactions with the highest fees, pushing fees upward.

We already have push APIs, both websockets and webhooks. See here:
Right now we run 3 peers, all in the US. But we're planning on expanding to different datacenters across different cloud providers (Rackspace, Google, AWS, Joyent, etc.) for very low-latency.

Point is not whether they can, point is whether any miner that matters does that. The security of the whole Bitcoin network itself relies on a majority of well-intentioned miners so all arguments involving evil miners are somewhat moot.

Tipping is a good use case. ZapChain uses this API for example. Also another user is working on paywall removal and payment for online content.

Duplicates are dropped on the floor, miners won't even see it, especially after the few seconds it takes you to walk away from the counter.
@_date: 2014-09-04 21:11:26
If. Yes. Bad things could happen if they update their software to mine only transactions with fees about 10mBTC. Point is: do they?
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:48:28
If it was this easy and cheap, someone would be doing it already. There are many difficulties you're ignoring in that reasoning, believe me.
For a start, averaging 4,000 transactions per 10 min (somewhat necessary to guarantee full blocks at standard transactions sizes) for 24h is already 6 BTCs. That assuming low fees. And 24h is rather short for a successful DOS.
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:06:24
Minimizing fees is actually much more complex than setting them to zero. For most cases, a 0-fee transaction will be rejected by the network. You need to be careful to:
  * check the transaction priority
  * check the size of the transaction
  * make sure no dust is generated
And you have to do that while building the transaction as fees are built-in.

At least a couple implementations are. And at least 3 are actively developed.

CTO from BlockCypher here.
Transactions are ordered in a block. If B spends an output from A, then A will appear first in the block. This is to allow sequential validation.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:23:16
To elaborate we (BlockCypher) do full consensus validation. In this particular case we have switched to strict DER encoding as required by BIP66 and won't accept invalid blocks.
I'm guessing the reason we're listed above in the wrong chain is the switch took us about a block. Ideally it'd have been instantaneous but due to the timing of the switch it took us a little longer to react. That has been fixed.
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:43:40
It was but our threshold was too low and binary (yes/no). It's now adaptive and more of a scale.
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:24:18
He definitely lost the electricity working on an invalid block.
@_date: 2015-07-08 06:41:04
Just do not tie the dust threshold to min relay, they're uncorrelated. Different knobs take different limits.

Look at "high_fee_per_kb". Unit is satoshis.
