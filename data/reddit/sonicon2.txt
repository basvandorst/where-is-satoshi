I don't like Alex Jones but this is all the proof you need of a decentralized system. You can't just ban a guy from money

Pretty sure this is a fairly economic libertarian subreddit. I'm one of the few outliers probably, but in general people not wanting government involved in the manipulation of money wouldn't want it involved in other areas

For some reason my bank never let me see the authorization charges so I have to use account transfer. I usually buy from localbitcoins, but the guy I buy from isn't selling so I had to go back for a small purchase. Now I'm just sitting waiting and hoping the price stabilizes.

It's not a conspiracy, it's just what it says. Whenever I do an account transfer, coinbase always flat out says before I do it that it takes 15 days. Every time. I get my coins, but that's how long it takes.

Not nice, I had $75 invested into Bitcoin now it's only like $60!

I'm as bad off as pretty much anyone, I only invested $75 into Bitcoin as a currency. Still, it makes me wait 12 days before I can use it after I buy it, so it sucks seeing my money continually deplete while I wait to be able to use it

I worked as a pizza delivery driver for a little while and still probably have hundreds of dollars in tips just sitting around that I use as spending money. Only thing my debit card goes towards is buying Bitcoin and ordering stuff

I once was in a computer repair class at what was then my high school. This was before Bitcoin was big, probably a few hundred dollars. A friend and a lot of people in my class started using our school computers to mine lmao, and eventually through the friend I told or earlier found out that one of his friends actually had like 10 bitcoin. I still wonder to this day whether he sold or held out

I too poured in my life savings, not at the crash though, before when it was at $5k. Granted, then Bitcoin started crashing after it hit $20k I got out with some solid gains. Only problem was that I was in high school and my life savings were only a few hundred dollars

Yeah I used to work at Walmart back from when the minimum wage was $9 to what it is now, $11 an hour. We were all surprised since our profit margin was very thin as was

This is the worst part about the crypto craze going on, as a PC gamer I would sometimes have to pay double for gpus.

I haven't seen one of these in forever but that was actually really good

What? Saudi Arabia's government was not installed by the US. I'm assuming you're talking about Iran, who had a us installed government (the shah) until he was toppled by Khomeini

I know people who would get these incredibly shitty, 7ish year old laptops from work and just mine on them for days, it way sad
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:16:37
Yep the bitcoin I've bought recently has been for probably a few hundred dollars or more lower than the actual price. Since some are trying to get it they're discounting

Just do bitchcoin lol

I bought in at the low this time and am already seeing those gains!
