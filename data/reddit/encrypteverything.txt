maybe, but there's a pretty good case to be made against the Baby Boomers.
I would say, with a straight face, that c. 1975-1990 was probably the most disadvantageous time to have been born in the United States in the last century, in terms of ability to gain stability and a foothold in life.
The piss-poor "leadership" of the U.S. gerontocracy has irrevocably screwed up a lot of younger folks in many, many ways. Boomers (and older!) have wielded the majority of power for the last 25 years, have a legacy of being the first generation in history to leave the country demonstrably worse off for their kids, and now refuse to get out of the way. It's sad that in 2015, the front-runners for the presidency are *still* all born in the 1940s.
Enough already.

Thermos is a joke.

He's not "stuck" anywhere... his sole job here is to more-or-less shut up and steer this subreddit towards civil discussion. While he can obviously have an opinion of his own, he should not be rampantly whitewashing and deleting posts that run counter to his opinion. If more people support 2 MB blocks or whatever, then so be it.
And speaking of opinion, this whole "[score hidden]" stuff, and the seemingly-immediate downvoting to "0 points" of new comments are profoundly stupid.

This is what this subreddit has become, prostrating yourself before the Grand Poo-Bah™ to curry his favor.
Good Lord.

uhh, nothing you do is "pro bono". A few years ago your primary bitcoin wallet contained 17,000+ BTC (I can provide proof on blockchain). And I have no doubt that you still have an enormous cache of coins. Even if indirectly, you have been paid beyond handsomely for running the bitcointalk forums.

Hey, that was my post...!  :-p
Considering he-who-shall-not-be-named-here actually ended up censoring this very thread not even 12 hours later, my comment was rather prescient, no? Truth hurts, I guess.

Wonder if he cares in the slightest that seemingly 95% of his own community here wants him out.

Erik, if/when a fork occurs and *if* at that point there's a gloating backlash against Theymos or certain developers, I can't say that backlash will not be entirely undeserved.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:16:41
Theymos, I'm asking this in all sincerity:
Do you understand that your extreme level of push-back will only drive people further and further away from Core? Even if [hypothetically] bigger blocks are genuinely disastrous and Core is better technically, your provincial attitude of "everything I don't like is an alt-coin" is doing Core no favors at all.

He didn't really need to say it, because the migration to the other subreddit is happening organically anyway.   :-p
