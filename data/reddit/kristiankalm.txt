Feel free to try it out then: 
Testnet, no real money will be exchanged, but you can open a channel with random node with some channels, and try to buy coffee from 
If the path exists, it will be found instantly and payment will go thru instantly

Bitcoin transaction will be written in to the blockchain, current block size limit is 1mb, that means maximum of ~2000 transactions per block. Average block time is 10 minutes, that limits currently ~2000 transactions in ~10 minutes. We reached that months ago, that means there is backlog of transactions, and who pays more can get faster confirmation. Now we need to upgrade protocol to continue, Core plan to scale is SegWit, which makes transaction data smaller, so more transaction can fit into one block and changes also make blocks almost 2 times bigger. Other school of thought is Bitcoin Unlimite, their plan is to remove fixed block size limit, so miners can decide if they mine 0.5kb blocks or 10mb blocks

Its safe to buy until the fork and transfer money to private key that you control - after fork be careful in which network you are

There is a big difference between centralized and trustless centralized. 
Believe it or not, centralized services work and scale better than decentralized services - but lighting offers scalability of centralized service without having to trust that party. You are still the only one who can spend your money. By making contract with nlock time you ensure that, if that third party goes down you will get your money back.
Same thing with exchanges, currently they you are trusting them with your money - if they go bankrupt or get compromised - you will lose your money. With lighting, you would get your money back, if they have not filled their part in set time.

Lighting provides instant confirmation - Imagine you trade at Bitstamp, you send them 1 Bitcoin with a 30 day contract - if they go bankrupt or their page gets compromised you will get your Bitcoin back in 30 days. In that time you are still the only one who can spend that money, by making contracts with other people (trading). So you could for example make 100 transactions (contracts), and in the end you will have 1.2 Bitcoin, which will be returned to you at the end of 30 days anyways or if you close the contract earlier (when everybody has done their part correctly)
Now you have made 102 transactions but only 2 have been in the blockchain - first and last - so you paid fee twice.
You can say that exchanges already can do the same thing, but its not trustless, lightning offers trustless instant transactions - only you can spend your money.

user activated soft fork was successful and trigger segwit soon, but bcash will hardfork in 1 hours resulting in chain split - if you buy now you will have 2 times the coins in 1 hours. Buying after hardfork you will only buy for selected branch, either core or bcc
edit: its 1 hour:

Sending bitocin to bitcoin does not require any middleman - you can build transaction manually or use offline wallet. However sending dollars to bitcoin requires buying bitcoin from exchange, who is the middle man.

Well it dosen't. Empty blocks could take in 0 fee transactions, which means spam is free.

They who? I am not claiming that bitcoin is the only one, I invest in other coins also, but not because they are cheap, but I like what state they are in and their future plans. Most of altcoins will die off when development stops and trading cools down to 0.

Think back to .com bubble, why don't you invest in pets.com when there is possibility that it could had same evolution than google.com - in reality one kept growing and growing, and copycats with just name and "great idea" died. There are some alternatives to bitcoin, but without knowing why and how they work / are being worked on, are not worth investing. They could be used for trading short-time, for profits, but if you wish to invest - bitcoin.
