Thanks. Do you mean it's expensive to transfer my wallets on CB to Trezor, or to any other exchange? Where do I see those fees for future reference? 
Sorry I'm not following you on the 'carrying pocket money with me' image. I've not come across anywhere to spend bitcoin in person and I'd most likely do trades from my desktop where I can do research, etc.

I want to do the same thing. Buy some to HODL and not touch and then some for more active trading. it seems like the only way to do this is to buy your HODL positions first. then buy in again for your trading, and choose LIFO. But once you do this you can't really make future trades HODL without buying them and then literally not trading for another year. 
FIFO seems like it only makes sense if you're only ever buying when you want to HODL and then sell rarely 1+ years down the line each time.

Forgot to ask, do you have a link that's third party and goes through the pros and cons of GA, Authy, and Authenticator plus? A quick good search on any of them and you can see horror stories.

yeah, while this is easier for organization, for tax purposes they don't care how many places you have coins. you file one tax return per person or family.

Thanks. Just saw this somehow. I need to learn how to hold it in trezor. is CB not safe because any exchange can be hacked? I see some sketchy ones overseas but I figured there's a bit more going on since they are conservative in who they allow in and US based and been around a long time. 
i'll have to discover what you mean by google inactive account, as well as others. I started using Google Authenticator with CB and it's been pretty good once I got the hang of it. But gemini wants Authy and I don't want to use multiple technolgoies and risk getting in a loop. 
Gotta figure out what mycelium is and you're saying have a separate non rooted Android phone around that is used for nothing but this (not my regular phone or tablet)?

Is there an article you recommend that goes through how to set up all these safeguards, for a noob? Articles like this make me think no one should do crypto with understanding ten levels of security and a ton of new concepts to them. I'm ready to begin but fishy there's yet some other important angle I haven't considered.
