They have my wire transfer and I have no available funds. They're a bunch of shady scam artists that will keep the money of those that aren't willing to pursue it.

Coinbase and Circle and etc are considered exchanges right?

Thanks! You're right about the network being slow! I had my transaction confirmed in about 30 minutes! 
Love the explanations btw :)

How do I say mBit? Millibit doesn't sound very good tbh

This is awesome and good luck to those who are gonna play! 
I was truly 50/50 on going. Greed or integrity? I don't really have an interest in computer history. 
My friend decided to help me choose by flipping a coin. The coin flip told me not to go. If I went and snagged it, would I feel good about myself? I'm not sure tbh...
