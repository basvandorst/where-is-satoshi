Instead of whining about 1 hard fork, let's whine about lots of them

Funny that you decided to go against being vocal instead of being an 'Ignorant vitriol with a pinch of arrogance'. :P

I would argue that one that holds fiat is not rich. He is potentially rich, he's got nothing until he sells it for bitcoin. 
You are still thinking in the old paradigm my friend.

He did send some bitcoin to hal finney at some point. A transaction from that address would be pretty convincing.

Until either of those two gentlemen gives us definite proof, I will continue to believe that satoshi's true identity is none other than Justin bieber.

Indeed, do you think he used his eyes or the underlying technology?

Hi Luke, thanks for responding. I'm trying to understand what you are saying.
So basically the network is only safe between the full nodes. If you connect to someone else's node  you are at risk of getting incorrect data. This may harm individuals, not the network itself. 
Do you mean with the supermajority, that there's a breaking point at which enough individuals are at risk for the whole network to become untrustworthy?

Does RBF check if the inputs and outputs have changed and reject it in that case? Maybe mark a specific input as the one where additional fees should originate from? Then it would be impossible to dubble spend in a way that anyone would disagree with it right?
