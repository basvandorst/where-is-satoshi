I didn't realize the receive address changed, that's where some of my confusion lay. The actual addresses are different though. However if I create a brand new wallet, and then restore it from seed elsewhere, all the keys are the same. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:00:36
Ah of course, I didn't think about it giving a new receive address, so I guess that part is cleared up. However, both wallets (which should be the same) are displaying completely different addresses under the address tab (I can't see any 'used' option or tab though). I'll try with a new wallet on both PC's, and see what happens, but I feel as though I have lost all the funds that I deposited into this wallet.

Any chance you could explain a little more about that? Is that a Linux command? Or is it a Windows cmd line command? 
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:53:48
Yeah, checked that too. Even if my keyboard localization was wrong, it should still work, as I'm hitting the same keys as the original password. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:16:09
Nope. I definitely have the correct seed. I print-screened a copy and backed it up on a secure USB, I printed a copy, and I made a copy by hand. At the time I made all of these, it was my one and only wallet, so I definitely don't have the wrong seed. The transaction definitely moved. I've checked several block explorers, and they confirm that the funds were sent to the correct address and that they are unspent, and even double checked the website where the funds originally came from. Everything is in order, as much as it should be. It's just a question of Electrum basically locking me out of my ability to actually send money or even access some settings. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 04:03:56
So, I just checked the two wallets against each other, and no, they don't have the same addresses. More disturbing, though, is the fact that they appear to be two different wallets altogether. They have a different address to each other. I have restored the wallet on both PC's, made sure the seed was correct, and yet it will only restore, with the funds there, on one of them. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:40:58
I'm certainly not saying that the error is Electrums fault, but I don't think it;s mine either. I'm not the most experienced guy with virtual currencies, but I made sure that I read, re-read and then re-read again, everyrthing before I set up the wallet. The problem with sending a small amount like that, is that I can't get a small amount. The only place I can acquire Bitcoin is localbitcoin, and I've only managed to find one seller who would accept my business without wanting to skype video chat first. And his minimum buy is 0.5 btc, which I just can't do at the moment. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:11:50
The seed is exactly the same in the second wallet. And I agree. From what I've read so far today, this just shouldn't be happening. I'm looking into Electrum 2.4 now, but it looks as though it's going to require some work learning a bit of Python and the like. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:09:38
I can create a new wallet, but I can't access the funds from this wallet. I just tried to restore this wallet on a different PC, and whilst it has worked, and doesn't look like it is going to give me any problems password-wise, there are no funds in it?
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:46:00
I'm not sure what you mean? 
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:45:00
Yes, I'm definitely opening the correct wallet. I've only made two of them so far. The original one, which I'm having problems with, and a secondary one just to check that I haven't done anything wrong with the first. Both are just normal wallets with a password. 
And yes, I compared everything in the addresses tab. They both contain the same list of addresses, but the restored wallet shows no funds. 
Thanks, I'll try another server, see if that gets me anywhere. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 04:19:54
I've waited for around an hour to see if anything shows up in the other client, and restarted it and waited again. Still nothing. And I've just checked the addresses again, and transparently they both are empty! The address of the wallet has changed (on both Electrum clients) from when I first created it though. I have a copy of the original address, and several websites such as the one you linked to, are showing that it does indeed have the funds in there. The weird thing now though, is that even though the address has changed completely, Electrum is still telling me that I have the correct amount of funds in the wallet with a new address? 
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:27:19
Right, I get you. Yeah it's 12 or 13 seed words. In theory, I shouldn't need the password. However, if I were to restore the wallet, and not use any password at all, it doesn't seem to register, and I end up with no funds. If I do use the password, I can see my funds, but I can't send them anywhere. I'm wondering if I can import my wallet.dat into another client, but I may just be delirious due to a lack of sleep. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:57:50
Oh right, I misinterpreted what you said, sorry :) I've been on a lot of forums looking for help, and a lot of people are saying that in earlier versions of Electrum, there were only 12 seed words, so I've tried using just 12, and all 13. If I only input 12, it won't accept it at all. I'm just about to try and use the seed to restore the wallet with a couple other clients. Not sure how far I'm going to get, but we'll see. Thanks for giving me some ideas :)
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:26:03
Thanks :) And I think I might have to at this rate :) 
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:22:43
No, absolute not. I created the wallet only 2 or so days ago, on the PC that I'm using right now.
@_date: 2015-08-11 02:56:06
Yeah, that's the first thing I did. I tried it with and without capslock, and even tried capitalizing the first letter of the password. No such luck :/
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:41:51
I created a post in the forums, just got to hope someone can help over there. I know for a fact that the password is correct, and that the seed is right. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:10:34
I've just tried using different layouts and encoding methods, but they yield the same results. I tried it on another wallet that I just created, using characters that only use alphanumeric characters, and it's still spitting 'incorrect password' at me. 


I'm not sure that I follow your meaning. The lost isn't exactly life-ruining, but it's not an amount I'm comfortable losing either :(
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:54:25
I've tried that. Several times now. I've tried just about everything I can think of in terms of mistakes that could have been made when typing a password. Nothing seems to work :/
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:18:16
Ah, would that be the python console then? If so, I have no idea what I'm doing, and will have to do a shit-ton of research :/
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:51:34
Yeah I tried that, just to make sure. Even tried using the OSK. Still get the same result though. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:50:45
It's just a normal wallet
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:54:38
I know the two wallets are independent, I only created the second one to see if the problem was persistent, bu seeing as I have no funds in the second wallet, I can't confirm it :/ Also, when I restore the wallet without setting a password, it says I have no funds, whereas if I set the password to what it originally was, then the funds become 'available'. I'll give it a whirl with Electrum 2.4 and see if that gets me anywhere. Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-08-11 02:57:24
I've tried restoring from seed several times now. When I enter the password at the first stage of restoring from seed, it acdcepts it, no problem. But as soon as I try to send funds, or even to try and view my seed or anything else like that, it asks for the password again, but won't accept it.
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:51:20
Ah, I see what you mean now. I didn't think to check, hold on, I'll take a look.
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:24:44
I've tried everything I can think of in regards to those methods. I've tried caps on and off, tried typing without looking but knowing i'm in the general area of the key I want, even tried going to the left/right/up/down of each key. Nothing will be accepted. I've now tried three different machine, and two different wallets, and I hit the same roadblock each time. I'm thinking it's something to do with my OS, my network settings, or a corrupt install of Electrum. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:22:12
I understand where you're coming from in thinking that I've got my wallets mixed up, but it simply isn't possible. I have only created two wallets. The first, which contains funds, and a secondary one to try and replicate what went wrong the first time. I have the seed saved in 3 different formats for the first one, so I know exactly which is which, and I used the same password for the second one. I get the same error with both wallets. Neither will accept the correct password. Not on the send tab, nor on any other tab/setting where a password may be involved. I don't know if it is the version of Electrum that I am using, or if it has to do with my network settings or OS. I can literally record a step-by-step of what I'm doing. I have just tried it on a third machine, with a slightly altered password, and it still gives the same error. Might be sending a pm your way soon :/ cheers
@_date: 2015-08-11 10:09:41
Yeah, that's a possibilty that I haven't seen mentioned anywhere. I'll give that a go :)
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:36:56
It's possible, yes. But you have to type the password in twice when you initially set it, and I can't imagine how I would get it wrong twice. I can't touch type particularly well, so I usually have to look at my keyboard, especially when inputting things like passwords. I have no idea how I would go about rectifying the situation if the password was indeed entered incorrectly. Is it even possible?
