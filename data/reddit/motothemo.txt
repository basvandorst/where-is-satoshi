I swear I tried to bring technical analysis to another coin’s sub reddit and got downvoted into oblivion for suggesting *potential* spike targets of that coin, IRONIC ‘INIT, tbh I’m not mad I get to screenshot and rub it in their faces when it does actually hit these targets and they’re dumbfounded because they had to stops in place

Never a bad idea to take profits (even a little) and keep the rest of the trade going. Assuming we follow the mini bull trend we’ve been experiencing 16k doesn’t seem too improbable
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:57:54
This guy bought at 20k

Hold so u don’t do the same thing next time we push higher, then sell there

On a serious note Ethereum is severely undervalued right now so he may just be building himself a diamond shaped cannon down there

Great! PS: it’s never a bad idea to take profits! For instance if we hit 16k and your crypto goes up 35%, taking out 15% into fiat or a stable coin (temporarily) is a good way to not only make money but reinvest after the accompanying correction!

Well traditional investors will say YES it’s a horrible idea BUT when has bitcoin ever gave 2 shits about traditional price movements. Looking at the July charts  from the past 5 years you can see there’s been an overall increase every year. What matters here is the time frame for which you hold bitcoin, if I were you investing with 15% savings I wouldn’t touch it until after the bitcoin halving of 2020 where we could potentially see a breach of new ATHs. HODL, the patient will be rewarded

So the way most people DCA is to set aside a portion of each pay check for crypto, doesn’t have to be a large amount - that’s the point, as long as you’re averaging low buys and then selling high after HODLing for a bit
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:20:18
20k for 2020 :)
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:40:03
I’m in the picture and I don’t like it. At least I learned to DCA :,)

This will end very bad due to a little something we call candle wick fishing,  for one it could miss your stop sell or buy by a couple 10s 100s etc.. Two, if it falls below 9k and you buy at 9k and it keeps dumping then you’re losing money just as easily as you can make it - welcome to crypto

I’m not a financial advisor, but going off my experience with crypto over the years a couple grand is very possible! ... bitcoin would just have to hit or exceed its price of 20000 since you bought in at 11k. If you check the log scale version of the bitcoin chart you’ll see the rise over the years so bitcoin going above 25k in that perspective seems very possible - but I’d recommend you look into dollar cost averaging and accumulating more over time. Also selling right after immense spikes and buying after the inevitable slight dip to accumulate works too but that only works if you know your way around day trading

This man knows how to secure profits!

1. It’s not gambling if based on price fundamentals, 2. If you put your stops in wick fishing zones you’re an idiot 3. I’m not trying to convince anyone I’m just tired of hearing “I missed the pump damn it!” 4. It’s crypto so you know what you’re getting into with the volatility so don’t complain if the market stomps you, this isn’t your traditional market 5. I hope we moon and we all get a bag, but in case of the opposite happens you may want to look into learning about shorting the market 6. Please continue to communicate on reddit as it’s a great place to share ideas and information on crypto! Happy moonin

Do.not.sell.at.a.loss - bitcoin on the technical analysis end looks like it’s still preparing to set a new yearly high

No wtf??? I’ve lived in 3 different countries and everyone I’ve known has used google chrome lmfao Facebook browser why in the hell would anyone use that?!??
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:43:10
It gonna be below 10k in the next couple weeks before a further spike up
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:29:16
That’s the right choice you may want to look into taking profit if it hits 16-18k

Anyone care to explain what citadel is?
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:25:01
I don’t have 50k on my retracements but I’d say around 50k below or above
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:40:53
Ahh the classic case of newbie FOMO, yes you realized this upwards spike isn’t sustainable - good. Now realize the price can pump even higher and fall down in the next coming weeks but we’ll most likely not fall to the 3500 level again anytime soon. If you are thinking long term investment leave it be and check back in in a couple months to a year you’ll be surprised ( bitcoin halvening occuring in 2020 )
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:19:05
If you use stop losses and stop buys in coordination with the past support levels, timing the market shouldn’t be an issue coz you’ll be prepared - anyways won’t be surprised to see it fall to 9-8k in the coming weeks or go to 13600
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:29:41
Guess what??? It hit 13,600 today and there’s was a stop sell waiting - case and point :))
