What he did is extremely stupid, but I think he learned his lesson without your self righteous condescending comment. Sounds like you got some insecurities to deal with. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:48:35

Yup. New to cryptos here not to investing, It's cringeworthy. You hit the nail on the head though people are using it to feel like they're part of it all, if you invest in cryptos you're already part of it all no need to try to fit in anymore than that.
