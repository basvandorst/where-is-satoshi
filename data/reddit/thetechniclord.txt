Try hiring someone else to use their phone? For the right price, people could agree (even I might...) maybe some (very small) percentage of the Bitcoin?

Hello! Some bitcoin would be nice, thanks for the giveaway! Probably give some to Khan Academy, they've got some nice stuff on limits...

It is happening now though, but just the beginning. Something like that takes a long time to happen of course, but the heat is being felt.

Yes, but if say a cryptocurrency becomes a viable currency. You could conceivably just store all your money in said cryptocurrency, since most stores accepted it, it is easy to exchange it for dollars and vice versa, there is no need for a bank, just a small amount of cash on hand if even. Now, this might never happen, but it is certainly a possibility. The age of the bank is (hopefully) ending.

Good idea, but remember all the EULA-tardation of the community that's been happening recently. I personally couldn't care less about the EULA, but if you're going to be selling stuff, be careful!

Kind of like how the ancient monopoly over bronze that strengthened huge empires was killed by the widespread adoption of iron.... maaaany years later. The monopoly didn't happen yet, better stop it through innovation now than eventually.

You distribute it like Google Play: put it on phones. Now, perhaps if the companies making said phones weren't greedy/paid by Google, this would work (unfortunately, they are both)

He is making a valid argument... I think the problem here is that they are mining TOO much, making TOO much of a killing, and therefore strangling the industry and undermining our freedom.
