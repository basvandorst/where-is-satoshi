It's been 4 months now, still waiting.  They've stopped responding to my emails, and refuse to give me a refund.
If anybody's considering a lawsuit against these guys let me know, I'll happily join in.  I'd love to see this guy rot in jail.

Has anybody actually received anything from Coinabul in the past month?  I placed an order 6 weeks ago and nothing yet.  Customer support is giving me the "2 weeks" treatment.

I just put my family on the waiting list for Citadel EU-53, and paid the deposit.  It's going to be constructed in southern France, near the border with Italy.
I know it's a long way off right now, but I think it pays to be safe.

"So what are you in for?"
"Molesting a dead horse."

I hope not.  I will definitely keep people here updated though.  I'd recommend holding off ordering anything until we hear that orders are shipping.

I think he's taking people's orders and then coming up with a wide variety of excuses (banks, shipping, government etc.) to stall shipment.  This gives him the time he needs to try and fulfill the order as cheaply as possible.
This includes -
* Fulfilling orders for silver coins using "junk" silver bought at a slight discount.
* Waiting for exchange rate fluctuations (USD, BTC, XAU) to improve profit margins at the customer's expense.
* Potentially using other people's money as investment to trade or mine Bitcoins.
* If the order is too large, or the customer gets too angry - not bothering to fill it at all.  In this case he'll just cut off all correspondence and refuse to reply to emails.
Please somebody take this horrendous operation down.

He's not worthy of any applause.  He's scamming people and stealing their money, and more people need to know about what's really going on here.
