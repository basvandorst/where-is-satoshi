Thank you.

And do you happen to have a rough number in fees for doing all this?
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:13:59
How was that gap created? Was that the span of the many ~300$ sells over that time?

I've recently began following the segwit vs nonsegwit issue. What's the basic idea, that segwit will offer larger block sizes and is a relatively quick fix while, not doing it will cause people to leave Bitcoin and it forking like Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:44:40
May I ask, how is electrum different than using a wallet like Bitcoin core?

New person question. Does this mean that they have it on standby, or that they are already processing larger blocks?
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:04:25
I'm shooting from the hip here, but if BU happens, then wouldn't there be two coins? Like what happened when people had ETH and were splitting it with ETC?
Thanks for your reply.
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:07:47
I understand. That makes sense. Thank you.

Start using Gemini or find a local ATM.

Currently, the AntRouter R1 from Bitmain hashes at 5GH/s. At that rate, it will take me 14k years to even want to think about finding a block.

Could someone please ELI5 this situation. I'm just a hobby miner, but I like reading about this stuff. Every site I look at is a copy if another site saying the same thing.

Most likely loss of client base.

Move your coins off to a wallet you control. You can buy a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor. You can also use light wallets such as Electrum.
Here are some wallets you can choose from: 
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:03:03
Use Monero.

There is nothing troll about this. People are trying to have a discussion and learn as much as they can. Either contribute or leave.

Exactly for this reason, you shouldn't use a US based Bitcoin debit card. More hassle than it's worth.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:59:30
You should not waste time using that to mine Bitcoin. Find a coin that is GPU friendly and mine that coin, then change to Bitcoin, or use NiceHash.
Aside from that, isn't mining exciting?! Have fun! :)

Electrum is used on a pc, which is susceptible to malware. Storing your coins on a pc like that is inherently less secure.

They increased my limit over time. Some times I would just get an email from Coinbase saying that they increased my limit. That was the extent of that interaction.
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:31:31
Realistically, you won't be able to buy a lot using a CC. Charge-backs are a risk these companies don't want to take, so they set the limit low. My CC limit on Coinbase is 1k USD. But my bank account limit is higher.
I have only ever used Coinbase. I'm not sure if Kraken or Gemini allow CC purchases.
Edit: wording.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:50:09

Exchanges have a trade history up to a certain point in time.
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:15:39
To add to this, only USD is insured, your crypto is not. Always transfer your crypto out to a wallet where you control your private keys.
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:48:08
And take my gains? Nah.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:36:52
The Blue specifically? To my understanding yes. I'm not a computer scientist but what I read and could understand, it is "safer".

This has happened to me as well. At first my account was a basic/unverified account. Then one day I log on and see that the withdrawal amount has changed. I verified to level 1, but that's it. 
Just waiting for that decentralized exchange, Soon™.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:56:46
So you're going the right way. Moving to a wallet where you control the private keys means that it is your BTC. The only thing regarding electrum and holding is that since the wallet is on your PC, you are generally at greater risk of being compromised a virus or something, if you keep your private keys on your PC. You can buy a hardware wallet or make a paper wallet, those are ultimately the safest routes. 
Edit: Here's the website for a hardware wallet. The Ledger Nano S is a great budget option for a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:55:05
Not a matter of how many transactions. It's a matter of keeping your coin safe.

Here's what use to determine fees. I like it because it's easy to read and easier to calculate how fast you want your transactions n to go through.

What you're saying is ~correct. But don't do it. Supporting Bitmain supports an attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:21:49
I do not. Only btc. I transferred out sjcx earlier, and I just wanted to get all my btc out. But this fee stuff is ridiculous.

Yeah, unfortunately, you'll have to wait the 24 hours to see if they will allow you to add it again. I don't like the feature either, but it's a safety.

This issue is because your bank sees Coinbase as fraud. I had the same issue with my bank. I had to call and tell them that it was me trying to add my card to Coinbase. They saw that every time I added my card, it came up as fraud in their system. Your bank will either allow the confirmation to go through, or won't.

It's speculated that these chips will be for large entities like Genesis Mining. Consumers will have to wait for regular GPUs
