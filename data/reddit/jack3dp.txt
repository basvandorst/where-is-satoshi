isn't there some scam going on where the tether is then being used to buy BTC on exchanges? Essentially creating money out of thin air (pumping price of BTC up)
Any truth to this?

The why doesn't matter. Things in the world change and he may deem that he wants to crash it for the "greater good" or whatever in his own eyes.
Without making this seem like a hollywood movie script, the reason why he may want to do so is not as important as the fact the he CAN do so.
It's such an incredible concept and well thought out and proven system... yet he broke it right from the beginning. Did Satoshi not envision that bitcoin would become this huge?

low volume sell off is not a good sign 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:15:01
cool story bro
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:15:21
Thanks.. and the seed is just the hash code that holds your bitcoin?

I really hope so as well. I bought at 17 :(
oh well. my intention going into it was to HODL anyways.
Suck thats my first BTC purchase, and a considerable $$ value at that, had be right before a correction, but i think bitcoin can still grow and evolve as an asset

What happens if you lose your phone? Or iOS corrupts or what have you and you need to restore to factory. I
Does bread wallet alleviate any of those concerns?

there's a good chance it could dip to 15k today... dont hold your breath. back up to 18k by saturday

It's an exchange. Money is siphoned in through traders...in your example, his initial $1000 investment is now worth $10,000, because some other traders funded their exchange accounts with $10,000, to buy those bitcoin off of him. 
Technically, if there were no buyers (in fiat $) to liquidate his BTC, then he would just have his bitcoin sitting in the exchange.

The one thing that stops Bitcoin from ever being truly legitimate in my eyes is the fact that some random developer who started it, owns 1million coins. How can one man have the power to ruin an economy? You may as well just stick with Fiat at that point as atleast government can be overthrown via revolutions... you can't really stop 1 mad man with too much power in a decentralized system like bitcoin.
Kind of stupid if you ask me, it's like Satoshi broke bitcoin on purpose. Has Andreas ever addressed this concern? Or any other pro-bitcoin advocate?

Is shooting right back to 16k so no 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:36:16
You're young. Go for it.
When you're 25. 4.5k will be nothing. that'll be like 1 months work (hopefully.. if you do well for yourself)
Whereas that 4.5k now has the potential to earn you alot more in the future if bitcoin realizes its potential.
It's a go big or go home type of play my man! Good luck with your decision

in for answer.. im registered on coinsquare but afraid of depositing... do i need a wallet in addition to my coinsquare account? I want to trade dips.. not hold for too long. what's the best exchange to use for this? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:20:41
what's a sell hold mean? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:59:52
can u buy and sell right away? or do they make you hold the BTC for a certain time period before you can sell. Also, is the sell instantaneous? 
Lastly.. BTC = bitcoin right? I dont want to buy cash or euretherm or any of the other stuff. 
Sorry for the newb questions 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:02:49
also isn't the 3.5% fee a bit crazy you think? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:19:14

@_date: 2018-11-19 21:46:52
