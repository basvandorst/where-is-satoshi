I'm assuming you think that bitcoin is a financial bubble since there is no possible way to bend the definition of pyramid scheme to fit bitcoin. So why is it a bubble? And an obvious one at that?
Edit: In particular I wonder what possible long term prices you see for bitcoin. Clearly $0 is one possibility. But is $1 really possible? I don't think it is, and neither do I think any other price under $10k is possible. Speculation? Yes. Bubble? No. Unhealthy? No. IMHO, but I'd love to hear arguments for or against.

I would still argue that it is correct to say that it processes transactions, because security isn't a separate thing but an integral part of transaction processing. Clueless people will always compare the energy cost with an ideal world they dream up with a benevolent arbiter sitting in the middle, deciding who owns what but as you say, this is the price of a decentralized cryptocurrency (and it's not clear that it is more wasteful than the current system)

None of what you list needs a turing complete language. There needs to be a serious complexity vs reward analysis and I suspect that the OP is correct that the complexity isn't warranted. Imagine when nodes start to disagree on the outcome of scripts (=contracts) in the future because the complexity led to bugs.

Pump, sure, but what has he dumped? He claims to have forgotten the password to the wallet with most of his bitcoins. Buying early, holding and spreading the word seems in line with his bitcoin-valuation. (in the $100k - $1M range)

He just meant that people who can't make an actual argument against bitcoin (or anything else) will try to paint it as something un-american.

Listen man, we've seen this happen time and time and time again. Someone makes a miniscule change to bitcoins sourcecode and try to claim to newbies that just are coming to cryptocurrencies that "Ok, you missed the bitcoin gravy train, but don't worry, here's your chance". Then they sell their altcoins to the noobs for fiat or bitcoins.
Bitcoin solved a HUGE problem when it came, and &gt;99% of the altcoins add nothing new. If bitcoin doesn't succeed it will be bitcoins 1.1 or 2.0 that does it. And people are gonna want to be on the same payment platform that everybody else is on, anything else is just impractical.

Yeah but how many billions of taxpayers money have gone to the banks to keep them liquid? 65 billion SEK for Swedish banks in the 90s. But I get your point, this situation is not good and seems to have been very avoidable. But it is a one time thing, this particular problem will be fixed and never come again. There will be a more scalability problems down the road, but "we're" pretty much building a new financial system from scratch, so that is expected.

Nice. I would avoid talking about mining as something that creates new value. I know that my BS-meter would be off the chart if I heard that. So explain that mining is how transactions clear, and miners get rewarded for helping out. If you'd explicitly say that bitcoin's value comes from its usefulness as a truly open payment platform with extremely low barriers of entry that would be... just great :)
Only talk about 2-of-3 private keys in terms of the possibilities for the users. Same with other contracts. It shouldn't be hard to come up with examples of scams that bitcoin will render impossible.
Then, I personally would stress how early we are in bitcoin's development and that most people couldn't ever learn to handle large amounts of them in a safe way on their PC given the current state of computer security. Solutions are on the way but they are not as much part of bitcoin as they are built on top of bitcoin. Like facebook is built on top of TCP/IP.
@_date: 2014-06-23 22:04:39
It's already a problem, but not a big one. Compare it to the altcoins' problem: You can't pay with them because everyone is using bitcoin. For an ordinary user that is a way bigger problem. People here think of bitcoin/altcoins as an exciting toy because they love tech and see no reason why everyone couldn't just switch to coin X. But for regular users *coin is a utility, as valuable as the function in serves. People are gonna want to use the same currency as everyone else. Like I wrote in my previous post which was predictably down voted - compare it to any other tech. Let's say x86 vs RISC in the 90's. x86 was at a huge technical disadvantage, and huge companies - apple, motorola, ibm - poured billions into dethroning it, but it still won due to its installed base. Now imagine if every x86 owner had a monetary value in their CPU - like current bitcoin owners have in their bitcoins. Now you have billion$ more reasons that it will adapt as necessary, in addition to whatever first-mover advantages it already has.

Obviously there are different ways of modelling developing and major currencies, in the ways that they are used. If bitcoin is used like a major currency, for example if its use as a store of value more resembles a major currency than a developing, even though it is not a major currency, then that model will give better result. The model might not make any assumptions about the currency actually being "major". I think that anyone who knows how to do research will grasp simple concepts like this.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:32:28
I think when the market is finished ironing out the prices bitcoin will be the only one with non-zero value. (Of course there can be any number of currencies with near-zero value providing that they aren't traded much, but let's call that 0 as well since any increase in volume would push them to 0).
Bitcoin is "real", or "unique" because it was the first decentralized currency. Currencies before it needed a central "authority" through which transactions had to go (like paypal).
A lot of people might be making money off Doge, but any crypto currency (CC) is only valuable because it is useful. Bitcoin was incredibly useful in many cases when it first came along, let's say for silk road as an example even though I'm not too fond of that. Now, the next CC that came along (litecoin) didn't solve any problem.
Let's compare it to the web. HTTP came along in the beginning. Anyone could easily make their own, incompatible version of HTTP by changing the commands, text encoding, stuff like that.. but why would they? That would only lead to a fragmented web. But I can assure you that if there was money to be made by creating an HTTP-alternative, lots of people would have done that. And that is exactly the situation we are in with CCs. The money that one person is making on litecoin/Doge must come from somewhere. And since they do not solve any problem that bitcoin didn't already solve before them, I have to conclude that the money comes from hopeful newcomers without economic acumen who think doge will increase in value like bitcoin.
Now, we have seen HTTP 1.1 replace HTTP 1.0, and google's much improved replacement SPDY will become HTTP 2.0. And that is only because it makes economic sense because of existing infrastucture. In addition to the infrastructure, Bitcoin also has the value of all bitcoins, giving even more motivation to keep the protocol relevant.
This is how I think about economics on a larger scale, and therefor I want to avoid altcoins, because for me it's the ethical thing to do. I'll never know who lost how many cents, but it doesn't matter. It's just annoying to be accused of being insecure or egoistic.
(Also, I know that 99.9999% of Doge-owners have no bad intentions and probably think that Doge is a valid long term investment)
@_date: 2014-06-23 13:23:48
What you wish for is just impossible. Altcoins will never be relevant, and mining will continue to concentrate. It just follows the same path as every other technology ever has done. But I'm sure there is a technical solution to the concentration problem once it becomes an inconvenience (like suggested)
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:53:19
No I think that people are worried that cc-newcomers are gonna sit there with altcoins worth 0, giving a bad name for all CCs. Not that it will matter for Bitcoins adoption in the long run but let's minimize the suffering if we can.

So how do we explain that BTC China had higher volume and price during the peak? Could this bot be someone at Mt Gox trying to make money on  arbitrage?

Good, it needed to be said. Far too many people just learn slogans and repeat them.
I have tried to learn more about economic theories that could relate to bitcoin but I have found it very difficult to find objective material. It seems like the modus operandi in economics nowadays is to start with the conclusion you want to reach, then work backwards and try to find evidence to support that view.

This is like the arguments why encyclopedias would always be better than the Internet for researching facts. I mean what a limited imagination to think that p2p lending would be "people coming home from work and act as a lender". Imagine a financial system with an open protocol in the middle that anyone could tap into and what that would do for innovation. Or don't imagine, because you can't - no one can.
@_date: 2014-06-24 10:49:20
For ordinary people? Most do. But in some cases crypto currencies have big advantages, however altcoins don't have these advantages compared to bitcoin.

Hadn't seen that "Journalist's Guide.." before but after a quick read it seems to deal with one of the things that annoy me the most; the the focus on mining.
On the other hand if you stop reading at the paragraph that starts with "Second common pitfall.." you won't miss anything, and it's debatable if the objections raised there are correct.

Because it will lead to price stability. Right now we have people (myself included) holding a lot of bitcoins with a conviction that they currently are so undervalued it is ridiculous, leading to a very thin market with few people selling where even small buys push the price up. Once prices get closer to being reasonable for a currency that looks poised for world domination with a reasonable probability, we will see a much healthier market. (And with getting closer I mean within a few % value, not 100%)

I use an old computer disconnected from the Internet to keep my real wallet, and keep a smaller amounts on my regular computer.
I think that the risk of trojans/keyloggers is too big to ever keep a large sum of bitcoins on a computer that is used for browsing the web.

Keep it in BTC. Bitcoin stocks are difficult because companies that have income in fiat will tank when (if?) bitcoin starts appreciating again. So you have to look for a company with income in BTC like the mining cos, I owned ASICminer shares, but have sold all of them.

Just to clarify for new people. The reason gambling sites are the popular addresses is that the original bitcoin gambling-service, SatoshiDice used the blockchain itself for the gambling. So you transfer money from your regular wallet and if you win you get the amount back immediately as a new transaction. Contrast this with JustDice for example where you transfer bitcoins once, then you can gamble with them as many times as you want without it creating new transactions on the blockchain.
(fwiw, jcoinner below writes that SD has now changed to another method)

While I can't possibly know for sure that Dooglus is honest, I can say with 100% certainty that you are clueless. You can get data to analyze if you want. I have, and it is bad luck for sure, but more a 1 in 20 thing than one in a million that you seem to think. The site loses or wins 5000 BTC in no time when Nakowa goes on a winning or losing streak. The variance is just huge compared to the +ev. Have you tried asking dooglus anything? Have you thought about asking someone who knows statistics? Have you thought about how you would do if you were dooglus and wanted to rob your own dice site? Would you do it discretely with many accounts under the radar or would you go in and bet sums that would make Andy Beal stop and think? Would you start a new dice site to compete with yourself? I mean for gods sake, critical thinking... your case would be a lot better if you left out two thirds of your "arguments".

He's fixated on the idea that bitcoin won't replace gold. I don't think anything will replace gold. But SURELY the ability to send money instantly to anywhere in the world without intermediaries is truly fucking useful. So if that's the problem you wanna solve, go for bitcoin. If you wanna be sure you're still liquid after WW3 ends civilization as we know it, go for gold. Or even better, go for a little of both.

There are a number of IMO common errors here. First off, why would your grandson dump 1000 BTC onto the market? Presumably he would not want fiat, but could buy stuff that he wanted directly in bitcoins, and would keep the rest in bitcoin.
BUT. even if he did want to buy whatever fiat is still alive then... Nothing would happen except some trading bot would pick up cheap bitcoins.
It happens with gold, someone dumped 100s of tonnes onto the market a couple of months ago. And that didn't ruin gold. Granted, bitcoin will probably not be as safe as gold, even in two generations.
There are many good things written about why deflation isn't harmful. People want to consume things for their bitcoins, the example of computers is a good one, you can always get a better computer for less money if you wait, still people buy computers.
Sure it would be nice if my coins lasted my whole life and my kids could inherit some. But I am already selling and donating, so even though I am the "hoarder" here, I might be selling more than anyone in this thread (45-50 BTC last 30 days), because that's what I am living on.

Amir Taaki was on RT today, and it was a huge lost opportunity in my opinion.
We have to remember what kind of people that we are targeting when appearing on these kind of shows: Everyday people who use their credit cards right now and think it works pretty well. So we should focus on low transaction fees, no middle man, speed of international transfers, not closed on weekends, talk about how wikileaks was censored, talk about Iranian parents trying to support their children's education in a foreign country, stuff like that.
Instead Mr Taaki came across like a complete lunatic for someone that has never thought critically about the current system and how banks tie in to it. He started raving about how fishing stocks were low because of the system, and on a direct question on whether you could pay for college with bitcoin he questioned why you would want to go to college when all these great websites are available, then instead changing subject to silk road that has "all these illegal drugs, really powerful stuff" (or something really close to that).
If you want to focus on the political stuff, focus on one thing and explain it in detail. I would choose inflation and how that benefits borrowing, not saving, and argue that we should reward saving and stop living on credit. I think that is an argument that would resonate with most people, sounds like common sense, and might get many interested in bitcoin.
The hostess, Sophie Shevardnadze seemed to have read up on the subject and was the one keeping it from a compete disaster.
