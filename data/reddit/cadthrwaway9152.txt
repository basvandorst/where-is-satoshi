I'm not 100% certain that it provides coverage for the script opening a LN channel would require, however even if that wasn't the case Bitcoin Cash has demonstrated willingness to hard fork for non-backwards compatible "upgrades" referring to their November fork. If there is enough demand, they should easily be implement an alternative solution if they don't want Segwit but do want Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:51:25


this is not always the case, i.e. one could generate a private key using coin flips or a deck shuffle irl for entropy
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:38:45
Because Bitcoin was meant to be spent, and spending it and promoting its use. That's what got us here. You can always buy the same amount off an exchange to prevent speculative loss using fiat as you pay the merchant in Bitcoin. The point is you're paying the merchant in Bitcoin promoting further adoption.

He's absolutely right... at least about the 500k at once. Unless you have made deposits into your bank of this size in the past without and prior notice this is a big "wtf?" and a HUGE red flag to them.

Again lol, I'm not making any judgement, simply giving input on a few things others should do to avoid this situation. If you want me to make judgements, I'd start here:

Gemini doesn't batch transactions either iirc, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:24:58
Still a little confused as to what your service provides? Liquidating isn't the difficult part, tax (because of cost basis) and the procedure afterwards is.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:12:03
No they don't. The reason Segwit is needed on Bitcoin is because it's a malleability fix. Bitcoin Cash resolved it iirc in their more recent fork*.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:21:21


This should resolve malleability in simple script transactions, but more complex scripts are still malleable.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:35:28


LOL? I'll let someone else tackle this if they want to. This is not why governments stopped using gold.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:03:56
How would this work in terms of taxes? ie if I bought a home in Bitcoin this sounds like it would be more of a headache then selling the Bitcoin and then just buying it with fiat ...?
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:46:08
I'm not condemning his decisions, but making a note of what he should have done and what others should do if in the same situation. He'll likely get his money either through the effort of lobbying social pressure (ie. what he's doing on Reddit) or by lawyering up. He should have also cross posted to r/bitcoinca since a rep. from QCX actually reads that sub pretty often.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:45:06
Bitcoin is fees are high - it's being spammed!
Bitcoin tx backlog is low - nobody is using Bitcoin!
there's no winning, regardless of what your position is.

1. You have no idea of her finances/savings
2. She gives you shit for how you spend your money (even as little as $50)
Sounds like a great marriage, but good luck pal.
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:08:12
It looks like neither this sub or r/btc understand fees, how do you know this fee is high OR low? How do you know how many inputs/outputs he had? It's pointless say I spent X BTC, or $X without any deals to the actual size of the tx... In the case of merchants when you're accepting very small transactions i.e. $5 - $10, you lose a lot of money when trying to consolidate...
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:02:04
Hence why I said, you *can* buy the same amount off an exchange to prevent speculative loss. You don't *have* to.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:12:49
I don't get how anyone fools themselves into believing anything otherwise.

Tell that to central banks buying up all those stocks, derivatives, etc. see Japan's balance sheet for example.

Uh... pretty such BCH fixed malleability (the factor of Segwit that makes LN not require additional development) in one of its hard forks a different way.

Even if there was no RBF, a miner could still include a **different** transaction than the one relayed which spends to a new address with even a lower fee. You can also detect whether a tx has the RBF flag or not.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:56:58
Few care about the technology and even fewer understand it. People aren't buying Bitcoin right now because of its technological merits, they are buying in as a get rich quick scheme. I prefer to think of most people in crypto as degenerate gamblers at best.

Implying the gender distribution actually means anything useful. More often then not it's harmful since standards are lowered so quotas can be met. Are you doing your part to encourage women in garbage/trash collection? Weird how I never see anyone protesting that...
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:25:32


Except many are realizing it doesn't mean anything given how many people graduate with a degree in Software Engineering and lack basic SE skills.

it's a trap
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:56:14
Have you considered that the reason many don't get involved is because they make difference choices in life as a result of having different wants, desires and risk tolerance? Companies should hire the best fit candidate for the job, unfortunately gender quotas often prevent this from happening. When they tried gender blind-hiring in Australia and more men were getting hired you know what the response was? "Oh shit, we need to go back to regular hiring not enough women are being hired!" I mean who cares about getting the most skillful people for the job, right?
If you genuinely find something interesting, who cares what other people think? If mean words are enough to get you to stop finding said thing interesting -- were you ever really interested in the first place?
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:42:58
With how concerned you are about the byte size of transactions I take it you're using P2PK instead of P2PKH to save space, or do you not care about the extra space a P2PKH output takes up? Should the 1x side of the fork survive, Core can blacklist spending from the address as you said to reduce the UTXO bloat. This is a soft fork.


Minor? More people will end up with lost coins with the OP_RETURN approach cause they wouldn't even know where to begin.

Every argument for why Bitcoin Cash could replace Bitcoin can be made for Litecoin except the r/btc "but LTC has segwit!!" If LTC hasn't displaced BTC and neither have technologies that try to address other problems such as ETH or XMR, then BCH isn't about to any time. BCH is nothing more innovative then an airdropped LTC.

Hard to get looked down upon when you find thousands of security vulns in the code they've been outsourcing to India, etc. Instead your colleagues start to resent you because they take the flack for not finding any of them in the years they worked there.

[Thanks!]( This is at least better then no replay protection and having to go through lock time transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:24:27
It's possible I'm illiterate on the matter but if 2X nodes and 1X nodes can't distinguish between one another, transactions intended for 1X will leak over into 2X node mempools and as a result be mined on 2X.
tl;dr don't need to even have a bot do it? Correct me if I'm wrong, and I'll delete this comment. Thanks.

There is no virtue in upholding a system that is inherently broken and biased.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:11:16
I agree with you in the sense that the way the opt-in replay protection was done it does little to help layman users.
Rather using an OP_RETURN marker, could not just simply have used a special address like the vanity burn address used by Counter Party as the marker?
It seems if that had been done, it's pretty trivial using most wallet software to construct a pay to many transaction which contains an output to the special address of 1 satoshi (or any amount) on the "main" chain which cannot be replayed over on the "2x" chain.
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:09:22
I take it you're one of those people that are probably into cryptocurrencies just for the $$$ and not because of the technology or what Bitcoin actually stands for. If so, I can't blame you for that, I know plenty of people like this.
If not, it's good that you're not in denial about how broken the financial systems of the world are, now wake up to how broken the legal systems of the world are especially in the western world when it comes to marriage.


The fact you think this shows that you have little experience on the matter. Pre-nups get tossed out all the time and become practically worthless as soon as you introduce kids into the picture.

? He's saying you can check if a transaction is **final** and treat it as a 0-conf, or if its RBF, and wait for 1 conf. You can distinguish a final tx from a RBFable tx.
