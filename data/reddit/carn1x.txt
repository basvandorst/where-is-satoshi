I just found out about it from this reddit post!

I doubt another payment method is going to increase bloat, if you're referring to the locally installed client.

I wouldn't be physically entering or leaving the UK, I would just sell BTC for a transfer to my UK account. As it stands I already transfer the same amount of money from my HK account to my UK account, so either I'm already doing something illegal or it's perfectly acceptable, now I think about it!

So I don't understand, in your answer for  how many BTC are rewarded for discovering a block and how is this restricted and controlled.
If the block discovery reward will eventually be transaction fees, isn't this a change to the logic? How are these fees likely to be controlled?

How would this work if I bought in Hong Kong and then cashed out in the UK where I have zero earnings (other than the BTC value)?

While it also doesn't address the OP's motivation, if you use Google Chrome, you can right click on the blockchain.info search box and select **Add as a search engine** and then change the keyword to something simple like "bc".
Then in the address bar just type "bc &lt;address&gt;" and you'll end up at the blockchain.info search result.

First I was running around screaming and then I realised I only gamble what I can afford to lose. You're gonna have to prize these bitcoins out of my cold wallet hands.

I am not American, I'm from the UK, and I'm only taxed on my earnings by HK govt.
Note that HK does not collect Sales Tax or Capital Gains Tax, however my earnings here are taxed meaning that any BTC cash-out here is just going to up my employment tax I suppose.

It's my understanding you don't need to trust the merchant at all. If the merchant screws with you, they risk the wrath of their payment gateway and the card companies as you can charge back at any time. The only reason you need to fear a merchant is when you're paying for a service which has a policy to suspend service when they receive a charge back, for example Valve's Steam service.
Source: I work at a company outsourced to handle infrastructure for a payment gateway, although I don't work in that department directly.
EDIT: Well your major risk is hassle as you mention.

Not so, I live and work in HK, and pay my student loans in the UK. I transfer money back every 6-12 months for this purpose.
Since I don't need to pay UK employment tax on my HK employment, I was hoping I could sell BTC in the UK for an amount below the UK employment tax threshold and avoid getting it taxed.

You had me at "stuff"

Sorry I think in my excitement I opened about 50 tabs and half-read them all, and now the dust is settled I'm realising not all of it sunk in, and I'm mistakenly thinking they aren't well documented, when it's much more likely I'm just a dork.

Moron here, what's the dealio?

Until I actually need to pay from it, I won't be typing the password on a network connected machine. Ubuntu Live CD only :)

Waiting an hour for Wikileaks to confirm the donation, no biggie. Standing around in a shop for an hour, not so fun.

If you want to buy fast then  should have people selling offering many different payment methods. When you try to buy the BTC will get escrowed so you can lock in a price, in my experience sellers deliver within 24 hours.
