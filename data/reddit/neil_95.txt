He was being satirical when he said that.

Blockchain.info gives me an error: 
I'm sure any other client should do something similar.

Well, that's not exactly what I meant. Apple's business model has always been to focus on making their products easy to use for the everyday person. Whether that's a good or bad thing is a different matter. But the fact is, Bitcoin is just too new and too confusing for the average, non-tech person. Find a random person on the street and ask him/her what Bitcoin is and how it works. Chances are, he/she will be totally clueless. We're making improvements, but there are still a lot of people out there that just don't get how Bitcoin works. Apple is unlikely to risk confusing its users by adopting what is still a very new and developing technology. Until Bitcoin is more established and understood, I can't imagine companies like Apple getting on board the Bitcoin bandwagon. It's a shame, but I suppose it shows how much more progress needs to be made. Making Bitcoin easy to use for the average person should be a primary goal to ensure Bitcoin's long-term success.

If there's one thing Comcast can do, it's taking your money.

WTF did I just watch?

Other than faucets, no. And really, faucets will throw you fractions of pennies. You'd be better off working minimum wage and then exchanging for BTC.

Good riddance.

Great graphics team. Terrible reporters.

Did you back up the entire device to your computer or iCloud? If so, you can restore that backup onto a different iPad to access all your data, including your wallet.

Good thing they're switching to Swift.

Formlabs looks amazing. But it's really pricey.

Just an fyi: Touch ID (and any decent fingerprint scanner) looks for vitality signs before accepting a fingerprint. So chopping off someone's finger and trying to use it on Touch ID wouldn't work.

I too have no idea what OP is trying to say.

How about Steve Ballmer?

Unlikely. Apple tends to stick to well-established technologies. Something like Bitcoin would confuse Apple's primary user base - i.e. the average, non-tech person.

He better leave one hell of a tip.

I can vouch for Namecheap. Purchased three domains and hosting with BTC.

I don't think the MH17 news had anything to do with it...
Correlation does not imply causation.

Not sure why you're getting downvoted.

To be honest, I was more impressed by that cool scrolling effect in the site's header.

This entire thread is full of them.
