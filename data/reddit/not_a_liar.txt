Yes, hadn't thought of that. This is most likely very true. I know I bought some after the news of overstock accepting them.

Yes I recognize that in the long run the value will not decrease, but in the short run?
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:39:08
yes my point was just that in the short run, as in right now, businesses do not have anything to spend their incoming bitcoins on and thus sell them creating an increase in bitcoin supply at the exchanges and therefore also lowering the price somewhat (in theory). They won't hold on to the bitcoins because that would be speculation as they are exposed to exchange rate risk just like any business are when they trade in more than one currency.

No, as long as it is not converted to fiat it should have the same effect as someone buying and holding I think.

You're right! Even the alleged $5.4 million spent on the hedge fund is quite small in relation to the total value of all bitcoins.

Yes I see now how the wording can be misleading. I didn't mean it in the sense that there are more bitcoins in total I meant it in a more econ way of supply/demand i.e. that there are now marginally more sellers of bitcoins in the exchanges than before.

Then please enlighten me :) I'm honestly curious as what the answer to this is. I'm guessing it is because they don't want the involvement of banks but then is it worth the risk of holding on to the bitcoins instead and hoping for the best?
EDIT: So you're saying they are still holding on to the majority of their BTC, they just spend small portions of it and slowly as more and more businesses are accepting BTC we can expect the same persons to spend more of their BTC?

and buy altcoins, this is too big of an amount for a mixer so it's the only way out. (Assuming this is a thief of course)

Good point. Your saying that people are more willing to buy bitcoin and hold on to them if they know that they can use them? But surely no one would buy bitcoins just to spend them on a retailer that accepts dollars. And even if they did they would only create a demand for a very short period and then the retailer would turn around and sell the bitcoin again?

to the moon! =)

Very good point! Hadn't thought of it that way. But surely demand must go up from the news alone.
