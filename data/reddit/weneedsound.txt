Wow, Coinbase lost a lot of credibility on this; at least with me.  
1) They are holding a large sum of my money that is locked up because my wire bank-name didn't match my verified-name. This is even though they've accepted transfers from my bank previously. I know many others are having this exact same issue, so they are probably using this money for something. pump/dump? ponzi?  
2) They don't respond to emails on the money transfer issue.  
3) The reversed wire takes 10 days, which is nuts since it only took a day to send the money.  
4) They ninja dropped bcash support. Which was obvious insiders knew about it. This is unprofessional, and will probably lead to the government coming to regulate this shit.

Could someone be putting up a huge sell wall to ensure their future contracts are profitable? Is that even possible?

On the order book, if you place a limit order for the current sell side price, will you get charged fees? or is it the price on either side of the spread that will cause fees to be charged?
