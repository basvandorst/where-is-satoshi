Come on, we all need a multi-year meth fueled sabbatical from the real world.

Not sure about OTC, but Gemini does limit orders, etc which can help mitigate market volatility.

Plus coinbase flat fee, plus their buy/sell price spreads.

More than double, often many times more than Gemini.  Coinbase got greedy. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:54:34
Yes, and then no.  Go try to buy, and then instantly switch to selling...big spread in prices! Not the case on Gemini.

The IRS has the data already... It's literally their job to audit it efficiently to find evasion...

That attitude is exactly what will lead to regulation and taxation, whether this sub likes it or not.

I've used both, Gemini is just as simple.

Actually, just placing bets over a "phone line" is illegal, and also the bank transfers in and out to place bets.  Gambling itself isn't what is outlawed although that was the intention.  Also poker is a skill game, not gambling.

[Are you not able to access Authy?](  It's what I use.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:40:38
It's fantastic.  Quick, simple and cheap.  Even has some neat features like showing the current buy/sell price spreads.

Is Gemini an exchange?
If that's the case, how can I buy with limits through a stock broker?
Regardless, if you have 2 similar options, and one rakes you with fees and prices, and one doesn't...why would you choose option 1?

To buy bitcoin with USD already in the account or $ that they will spot you waiting on a transfer is almost instantaneous.  I've only transferred Coinbase&gt;Gemini, and it was 30-60 minutes?  I'm just here for the ride, I don't buy any goods with BTC minus a couple of small donations I've made.
Let me know if you don't have a good experience, I'd like to know more about why people shouldn't be on Gemini, because right now I'm not seeing it.

I moved to Gemini and haven't looked back.  Coinbase got very greedy not only with their fees, but their buy/sell price spreads, basically operating like an airport currency exchanger.  Not only that, every time there was any volume in the market they would be unavailable.  Gemini works flawlessly, has low fees, and has some nice things like showing current price spreads.
Vote with your dollars, don't support a service that isn't meeting your needs.

More likely that someone was trying to manipulate the price down so they could buy on the dip they created.

You guys should be angrier at the US government, who is undoubtedly pressuring exchanges using the flawed US laws in regards to online gambling passed in the 2000's.

And Gino's is a legit barber shop too. I use one around the corner from me.

But LN currently only runs on test and uses tBTC?  Where does real money come into play right now in dealing with the LN? 2 honest questions.
Edit: did more research and can help answer my own questions if anyone else has them. Lightning Network is live on mainnet now.  The Lightning software is still in early stages of development, thus it is seen as risky to use your own real bitcoins on mainnet if you were to run a LN node.  However, you could get ready on test to switch to mainnet when you have more confidence in the releases.

Advertising this doesn't really help in the US given the Federal government's stance on national bank's involvement with the marijuana industry.  It could either lead to them seizing domain's and shutting down exchange sites, or blocking banks from doing transactions with exchanges.  Though I know such a thought will be unpopular in this hyper-idealistic space, they have done this before, for example with online gaming/poker.

I tried to pay for a haircut today with Bitcoin and they were also using Bitpay.  Kept getting an invalid address error. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:12:37
Can anyone give a ballpark of how much bandwidth per month, in GB, running a LN node might use? Preferably based on your implementation on the current testnet.

The only business I tried to pay at was a bitcoin enthusiast and it turned into this massive hassle that took a few days to figure out. Normal businesses aren't going to deal with that.

I tried using a locally developed wallet (well reviewed) on my phone.  The merchant was using Bitpay. IIRC my wallet didnt think their address generated by Bitpay was legit.  There was supposed to be a discount for using bitcoin. After a couple days of going round and round, I just transferred the non-discounted amount from my exchange account.

You're showing some real naivety regarding the basics of investing.  You should avoid being overinvested in a single asset.  Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.   And absolutely you should dollar cost average when putting in a sum this large as no one knows what's going to happen in the future.

Gamblers logic. Definitely not advisable for most people's financial situation.
