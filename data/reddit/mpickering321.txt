I know it's not a charity at all, but I'm working with my old high school and current university to make a drone racing competition. If you would like to help us out, every bit helps out and it would be hugely appreciated!
Thank you, and of course give to people who need it more, but if you can feel free to PM me.

Thank you very much. Will definitely pass along. Love good causes like this.

Dang this is one of the best things I've seen on reddit. I wish I could do something for the community like this one day. I will pass on my part.

Lol probably. My heart rate today was literally 160+ for an hour straight. Plus a lift afterwards

I like this since I'm in high school and row every day after school and on Saturdays. I could probably make a lot.

Thanks a lot. I really want to see what I can do with it. I currently have no experience with any of this so I'm really thankful. I don't even have a wallet yet.

Ok thanks guys for all the pointers. One more thing about mining, is coinwarz a decent calculator for determining mining profits. It predicts currently an s5 would make $700ish per year taking into account electricity.

Ah I see, I didn't really realize the last part of what you said. Good to know. I'm so new into this I don't even have a wallet to collect the bits I've been given. And I'm mostly genuinely really intrigued by the technology with the hashing and mining hardware (I usually hang around but also into the idea of kind of free money.

Ok I think that's a good idea to get a smaller one first. Thank too for the bits. I still need to figure out how to collect them. I don't even have a wallet yet.
