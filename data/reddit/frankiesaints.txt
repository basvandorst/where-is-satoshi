Class actions are lawyers seizing an opportunity to get paid.

That's what class action lawsuits are for.

Somewhat same, I stopped all things Bitcoin related in early 2015. Now have a mix of alts+BTC and it's my alts that have me at about 10-15% down overall.

Funny, if you could only go back and say to yourself "put a few BTC aside every month for the next 4-5 years" ... You'd be a couple-hundred-thousandaire by now.

But it's not even remotely close to same in America. You were referring to minimum wage, right? You "sigh" as if you're still correct but giving up on arguing, but I'm reading your comment the same way and I have to say, if you think minimum wage in the US is anything like what we're talking about here, you should visit Venezuela, and see how far $1,250 USD will get you.
Obviously this hypothetical scenario is a bad idea, because you would be robbed in no time, as there are some extremely desperate folks out there.
Now see what $1,250 USD will get you in a month in a LCOL area in the US. I guarantee you can live with plenty of food, cheap transportation, a studio apartment with 24/7 electricity, clean, running water that you can drink straight from the tap

Everyone I know is intimately familiar with annual cost of living increases, and getting the bare minimum cost of living increase is looked at as no progress in career.
At my employer, it's automatically calculated and given to people managers, very rarely does someone get less than cost of living as an annual increase, but can happen for very unmotivated, unengaged employees.

Someone from the US would stick out like a sore thumb anywhere in Venezuela.

I think he might mean a bit more revolt against Maduro type of situation than civil war between supporters of Maduro or Guaido.

I have some heavy XRP bags that I'm basically 50/50 on as of now lol... Bitcoin I'm sure will be worth SOMETHING in the next 5+ years, XRP not so sure. I keep telling the one person who knows I do anything crypto-related "I'll either be rich or broke, no in between" (granted I have only ever put in what I can afford to lose).

BCH is garbage, but BSV is like that garbage you forgot to take out, when you knew damn well you had shrimp cocktail and those tails were in the bottom of that bag next to the raw chicken that already went bad in the fridge and the broccoli leftovers... oh and you took a shit in the garbage thinking you were gonna take it out in the morning anyways.
That's the BSV garbage.

I do agree on the false advertising. They'll have you go through pages and links and purchasing saying Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin... Then when you're like wow I'm really buying 7 whole Bitcoin? Wait, what's BCH?
Obviously we know better, but the deception is real, and a threat to newcomers. I can't stand BCH's tactics, but I am disgusted by BSV, if that paints a better picture?
