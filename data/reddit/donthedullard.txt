Anything in the top 40 could really imo.  It will be all about market share.  
For instance, Bitcoin will be like China and America combined.  Litecoin will be like Japan, etc. etc.
I'm rooting for GoldCoin mostly because I like the team and most of them really like gold as well.

Alt coins are great for anonymity.  Trade your bitcoins for altcoins, buy weed with said altcoins and it's untraceable  
There's room for all if you ask me.
In the end bitcoin will have a currency value equal to that of China and the US and the other coins will split the difference wit the rest of the world.

fiatleak.com still shows activity in China so they are clearly trading bitcoin for something.

What's the point in this?  If I want anonymity, all I have to do is sell my bitcoins for an alt coin and buy stuff with the altcoin.

Yeah...it can do all that except moving out of fiat with minimal fees.  Bank transfer fees will apply unless you use localbitcoins and that could take a while.

Taking preorders...sounds familiar.  Expect them to actually be released in 2016.

If this crook disklikes it, it must be good.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:25:24
Well there you have it.  If one of the biggest crooks on this planet dislikes bitcoin, it must be for real.

BitDNS is such a better name.

Fuck Wikipedia.  They are a scam site now.  Their protocol sucks for getting information on or off.  Only those with special interests and a lot of money can do it easily.

Something like a coin card with a hardware interface at home.   I'm not sure.

I'm shocked people can buy cars for 1k.

Until the Chinese realize there is little their government can do besides harass exchanges and banks that deal with them.
Decentralized currencies aren't going anywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:01:43
Question:  Is the Chinese Central Bank run by the government or like our central bank run by "who the fuck knows"?

Greenspan can't even identify bubble gum.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:29:23
Greenspan still thinks the Internet is a fad and typewriters are the wave of the future.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:59:17
Wikipedia is bought and sold now by special interests.  They are no longer what they use to be and don't deserve a a fraction of a bitcoin from anyone.
Someone needs to create another open encyclopedia and show wikipedia how it's done.
Hell, I'll bet reddit could do a FAR better job.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:32:38
Yeah...China is eating India's lunch.  If those two are indeed in a cold war and bitcoin turns out to be a mega-huge currency, India might as well surrender.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:26:57
You can give someone .1, .01, ,001,.0001, etc bitcoins.  They don't have to be moved around in whole units.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:02:20
If it's run by "who the fuck knows" does any of this even matter?
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:32:16
I hope they go under.

Your true problem is you don't appreciate your health.  Go watch some people die here in some subreddit.
I know a guy I spoke with last week that got ran over by a car.  He's dead.  You think he gave a shit about his bank account as that car hit him?
You're going to go around sulking and then die.  You want to talk about regrets.  Imagine how YOU'LL feel as you die knowing you wasted your young ass life sulking over this.
