this looks interesting. 1% on deposits. But my guys have GBP, so there will be probably another 1-2% on conversion... Anyway thanks, worth trying

Bitcoin is gambling, you can lose it all in one day, the software is still young and a blockchain fork may appear or a better competitor. 
However having said that, think what a profound research Overstock should have done before starting to accept Bitcoin. The CEO put his head on stake by doing it and he operates millions if not billions. The same with TigerDirect. These companies can't just switch here and there, they research well before they take  a decision. 
Me personally, I also research as well as I can, and I watch [Richard Brown]( IMB architect and [Andreas Antonopoulos]( who is saying quite obvious thing that in next two years bitcoin will increase in price very much because more companies will accept it and the amount is limited or fall to ground due to some error, just to let a new project skyrocket. So the point is this is the era of cryptocurrencies, it's a done deal.
i also think that Bitcoin was done by [NSA]( itself or some guys like Snowden with insanely high qualifications, it took them many years, and it won't be easy to invent something better currently. 
Put at least some money in Bitcoin, you will be swearing yourself in a couple of years if Bitcoin shoot through the roof.

Recently, 4S Buik reseller store in Dongguan city Guandong province announced a promoion using bitcoin and litecoin. The promotion include three models 2.0L Regal GS, 2.4 The new LaCrosse Smart Comfort Edition and LaCrosse Snake version 2.4
The store has thus become the first Chinese auto industry to accept bitcoin payments for 4S.
Central Bank Notice from December 5, said that bitcoin can not be used as money, therefore, buying goods with bitcoin is unclear under the Notice.
But 4S shop uses daily exchange rate of RMB to price cars for customers to buy cars, using yuan. If such a way is consistent with the spirit of the Notice, there may be more business this way to promote their products.

Apple Moves Toward Expanded Mobile-Payment Service
Apple is laying the groundwork for an expanded mobile-payments service, leveraging its growing base of iPhone and iPad users and the hundreds of millions of credit cards on file through its iTunes stores.
By Douglas MacMillan, Daisuke Wakabayashi
Apple Inc. laying the groundwork for an expanded mobile-payments service, leveraging its growing base of iPhone and iPad users and the hundreds of millions of credit cards on file through its iTunes stores.
Eddy Cue, Apple’s iTunes and App Store chief and a key lieutenant of Chief Executive Tim Cook, has met with technology industry executives to discuss Apple’s interest in handling payments for physical goods and services on its devices, according to people familiar with the situation.
In another sign of the company’s interest, Apple moved Jennifer Bailey, a longtime executive who was running its online stores, into a new role to build a payment business within the technology giant, three people with knowledge of the move said.
Those people said Apple also spoke to at least five other well-known executives in the payment industry about the position before tapping Ms. Bailey.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, and declined to make Ms. Bailey available. Ms. Bailey didn’t respond to requests for comment.
A payment service would launch Apple into what is becoming a fierce battle over how people pay through mobile devices. Other players include eBay’s PayPal unit, Google Inc. and startups such as Square Inc. and Stripe Inc. Forrester Research estimates that Americans will spend $90 billion through mobile payments by 2017, up from $12.8 billion in 2012.
Just this week, Stripe said it received $80 million in funding that valued the four-year-old startup at $1.75 billion. The same day, activist investor Carl Icahn called for eBay to separate PayPal, which he called “a gem” of its business, into a separate company.
Mr. Icahn also owns a stake in Apple, and has been pushing the company to return more money to shareholders. In a letter to Apple shareholders Thursday, Mr. Icahn urged the company to invest in mobile payments. “We believe a revolutionary payments solution is now a very real opportunity that the company could choose to pursue,” Mr. Icahn wrote.
Currently, Apple handles payments for movies, books, and music purchased through its iTunes store. Consumers can also buy apps and pay for items such as digital goods within an app through an iTunes account.
In its retail stores, Apple allows shoppers to pay for some products by scanning the item and paying with a credit card tied to iTunes. It has introduced new technologies that could allow for paying through an iPhone, including a fingerprint reader for security and an iBeacon location-sensor that detects when someone is nearby.
However, Apple does not allow consumers to pay for physical goods and services, such as shopping for clothes or hiring ride-share service Uber, using an iTunes account. Users still need to input the credit-card information manually, an extra step that often deters purchases on smartphones.
“Apple is absolutely the sleeping giant in the payments world,” said Denee Carrington, analyst at Forrester Research. “They have the capability; they just haven’t tied it all together.”
The Journal reported in 2012 that Apple had studied ways to break into payments, going as far as working on a “wallet app,” before scaling back ambitions over concerns that customers might blame Apple for a bad experience with a merchant. In April 2013, Mr. Cook told investors on a conference call that mobile-payment technology was “in its infancy.”
Speculation about Apple’s interest heightened earlier this month with the disclosure that Apple had applied for a patent covering payments for goods through a signal sent from a phone to a wireless receiver. The patent could indicate an interest in letting iPhone users pay for goods in stores through their phones. It isn’t clear what Apple’s exact plans are or how far along it is in its strategy.
Apple could offer iPhone users the option to fill in credit-card information automatically based on a card already registered with iTunes. Another possibility, raised by one industry executive, would be to reduce fraud by using Apple’s fingerprint reader before completing an online purchase made on an iPhone.
“If Apple is in the game, it certainly changes the space and would make merchants think differently about who to partner with,” said Ms. Carrington.

Anyway, as an example: you can easily get millions to Hong Kong from China for less than 1%. The traders operate hundreds of personal accounts. They are in grey zone. Their daily volumes are millions of dollars. Nobody arrests them and through in jail

About a year ago, I started using bitcoins at the salad bar in my local deli. I always like to be ahead of the technological curve, and using virtual electronic currency was easier than carrying cash and more secure than using a debit or credit card.
There is only one problem with this exotic currency, which is derived from complex algorithms and "mined" by computers in places such as Iceland and Hong Kong—a concept I do not fully understand. It's that the value of a bitcoin fluctuates by the hour, sometimes wildly. So a salad that cost me $5.95 on Christmas could cost me $35 by Presidents' Day. This is more than I wish to pay.
Bitcoins and other alternative money systems are slowly but surely taking over the world. Overstock, the online discount retailer, will soon begin accepting them, and other major retailers are sure to follow. If Visa and MasterCard ever get on board with this thing, we can probably kiss the peso and the Turkish lira and the dinar goodbye. Not to mention the Scottish pound.
Friends have already experimented with bitcoins and altcoins and litecoins and peercoins and greekyogurtcoins and weezercoins. Generally speaking, they have been overjoyed at the way these ingenious electronic exchanges reduce transaction costs.
True, all of them have had minor problems. If you buy a shirt with bitcoins during a special 20%-off Founders' Day sale for shoppers who use bitcoins, and then you wait a month to pay the bill, the item might cost you five times the original price. My local diner will let you pay for the meal itself in bitcoins, but you have to tip with altcoins because the wait staff doesn't like the way the better known currency can undergo sudden shifts in value. To my great annoyance, my movie theater will not give me promotional credits for free popcorn and soda when I pay with bitcoins. They insist that I pay with their own in-house electronic currency, 47ronincoins, mined on powerful computers in Osaka. Ironically, the price of a ticket to see "47 Ronin" is exactly 47 47roninincoins. Weird coincidence.
Lots of businesses are still pretty fussy about these currencies. Three weeks ago, a friend took the Browns plus eight points, but Cleveland went into the tank and lost by 11. His initial wager was in peercoins, but his bookie insisted on being paid in litecoins. My friend had lost all his litecoins shorting bitcoins. So now he has two broken legs and a second mortgage.
Despite these snafus, I think the future for alternative currencies is bright. They force meddling governments to the sidelines and allow consumers to make delicate transactions anonymously. But there is still some rough sledding ahead. My plumber takes only prolecoins, derived from an algorithm known only to unionized plumbers and electricians and a few guys who work with sheet rock. The coins are mined on computers somewhere in Yonkers, N.Y. Ironbutterflycoins and badcompany/foreignercoins are accepted at most venues where high-class has-beens perform regularly, but not at most hip-hop clubs. Many fine eateries have signs in the window: "Cash or Credit Only. No Altcoins." Others read: "Bathrooms for Customers With Bitcoins Only." So you can see how this thing is still a bit of a mess.
I really, really like bitcoins because I visit a lot of bad neighborhoods, and hoods can tell just from my demeanor that I am a bitcoinista, the kind of guy who clearly carries no cash and is pointless to mug. But even I have encountered a few hiccups. When my car's transmission went a few months ago, I paid in bitcoins, but after the Chinese government cracked down on the revolutionary new currency, its value fell by about 40%, and my mechanic insisted that I pony up the difference in hard cash. And I tried to give my kids bitcoins for Christmas, but they said no, give us Jägermeister instead. Damn luddites.

they can expand "actual money" easily, if they borrow 1$ from another bank they can give 9$ of real loans, so it is easily surpassed, at least I understood like this from various documentaries. If they still short they can borrow from Fed. If they fuck up (they give to some sub-prime guys who waste the loan on drugs), eventually people pay for them, because they hold the govt by the balls. 
And all this because the money is not limited, so thanks to them we have Bitcoin now ;)

Actually Bitcoin can be taxable. Imagine you open a software company and  register a bitcoin address associated with it. All your clients pay you on a bitcoin address that  you state on your web-site. Then all your income can be seen very easily. So given the will bitcoin can be as functional as bank accounts. The only difference is that you don't pay service fee and your savings never devalue. Additionally it can be as functional as cash - anonymous and untraceable ))

May be the chairs and tables are paid by taxpayers, but this does not change the system: the private banks create money at their will and so called "Federal Reserve" is just a cover for this business. That is the reason of a USD falling below the sea level. 
My understanding - it is completely private, but nowadays they once in a while make a show of president approving a chairman.

@_date: 2012-05-28 14:42:29
right, monopoly, but in many countries (china, japan for example) it is not a problem. 
The problem is that the public asset - money, the blood of the people is used for profit by a group of people who are (now attention!) **not public servants**. This is the key. Public servant does not profit from interest on loans but receives salary for example like in China for giving loans to right people like electronic producers etc.
In US the system was hacked in 1913 and now the govt became privately owned by bankers, rather than Fed became public.

In many countries people always log cash payments because the taxes are low and fines are high (Singapore, Hong Kong etc) . There is a way to check it - you just do a test buy and then check this transaction in the ledger. The same could be theoretically done with Bitcoin.
So bitcoin is better than current financial system in all aspects.

Federal reserve is as federal as Federal Express. The fact that the president approves the chairman, does not mean anything, what really matters is how banks create money - any bank can give you [any amount you want out of thin air]( and trying to change this system will cost any president his head.

You are right in a way that this system was approved by the government and it makes it public, so basically the public itself agreed that the money system (which is originally a public asset) would be owned and managed by private banks. And may be in 1913 Federal Reserve was 100% private bank, now they changed the docs a little to appear govt agency, that does not change the point - few banks benefit from money system. And here comes bitcoin

I heard in America they have a saying: "If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?" 
If everything is perfect and controlled by the govt, Congress and The People why it is so screwed up? Just look at the inflation before and after Fed, just check the history how they created the Fed, how many conspiracy and secrecy there. May be the president already can not change anything because of the amount of debt that US has. 
The Fed IS the reason Bitcoin was born, because everybody is sick of the banking mafia, who are so crazy, they build their separate lifts not to share it with people 5 minutes and their offices are called North Pole because of amount of cocaine there (saw it in some documentary).

So looks like big shops stopped accepting btc mainly because its convenience is currently inferior to alipay 
By the way I don't think bitbay will bother about customer protection....  Actually customer protection is cool, if I can get it for free, it's good. But it costs 9% (4.5 % paypal seller commission and 5% paypal exchange rate difference for foreign currency). I am not sure how successful bitcoin would be if paypal charged 1%.
My conclusion: Bitcoin is not banned and still legal in China for shops, there are a lot of shops accepting it, but currently alipay kickass and big shops don't even bother to offer btc option. 
Question: then what are the incentive for a shop in china and a customer to make a deal in bitcoin? (For me for example is 9% total commission and filling this stupid textboxes and security SMS)

yeah but if you have to pay premium for USD it is logical that you will have to pay premium for BTC. Take Venezuela as an example: you can't get USD at official rate, so you can't expect anybody to sell you BTC at the rate corresponding to official USD. You will have to buy USD at (black) market rate and then buy BTC. Or you pay for BTC using blackmarket USD rate and that's where people start freaking out, but there is no surprise here, the govt can print any rate in the newspaper, but if the govt stole all USD, you will have to pay market rate

Hire of Raj Date Boosts Bitcoin Credibility
Former No. 2 at CFPB Joins Board of Company Focused on Digital Currencies
By ROBIN SIDEL CONNECT
Updated Nov. 14, 2013 12:13 a.m. ET
A former top official of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon.
Raj Date, a banking-industry veteran who has pushed for tighter regulation of the financial system, has joined the board of a new company developing ways to get merchants and consumers to use the virtual currency.
The move is likely to add credibility to fledgling Circle Internet Financial Inc., which last month received $9 million in financing from venture capitalists.

The price of a bitcoin rose to a record Wednesday, fueled by rising expectations the virtual currency will continue to gain traction as an alternative to traditional methods of payment. The currency fetched $441 on the Toyko-based Mt. Gox exchange and $394 on the Slovenia-based Bitstamp Exchange, nearly doubling since the start of November.
The momentum behind bitcoin is coming from around the world, as amateur investors, venture capitalists and technology enthusiasts pump money into businesses that are trying to figure out how to use bitcoin to buy and sell goods and services. A growing number of merchants accept bitcoin, because the transaction costs associated with the currency are generally lower than those for using credit cards or debit cards.
"Our clients have seen an uptick in interest among a wider circle than just the types of people who were early adopters in the U.S.," said Adam Shapiro, a director at Promontory Financial Group LLC, a financial-services consulting firm that is advising clients on bitcoin ventures.
Bitcoin is a four-year-old virtual currency that isn't backed by a central bank and can be traded on a number of exchanges or swapped privately. Bitcoins are generated by solving complicated math problems, a process known as mining. That pursuit is getting increasingly complicated and expensive, as companies and technology fans race to build the powerful computers required for bitcoin production. There is a limited quantity of coins to be mined.
Circle, launched last month by technology entrepreneur Jeremy Allaire, aims to develop services that make it easier for businesses and consumers to use digital currencies. The Boston-based company has received financing from venture-capital firms Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners.
Mr. Date "brings tremendous experience to the company, and a very deep understanding of critical regulator issues and how consumer-financial products interact with the government," Mr. Allaire said in a telephone interview.
A former executive with Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp., Mr. Date was hired by Elizabeth Warren, now a senator from Massachusetts, to set up the CFPB in fall 2010. He was the agency's No. 2 official until his departure at the start of this year. After leaving the CFPB, Mr. Date launched Fenway Summer LLC, a 12-person consumer-finance advisory and mortgage-lending firm based in Washington. He also serves on the board of Prosper Marketplace Inc., a company that helps people lend to one another.
Mr. Date, 42 years old, said he became interested in the bitcoin phenomenon after delving into the traditional money-transfer business while working at the CFPB, where he also helped set new mortgage rules that require lenders to ensure borrowers can repay loans.
"The underlying infrastructure of the payments industry is decades and decades old. There is a tremendous opportunity to change that and build better products for consumers," Mr. Date said.
Federal ethics rules prohibit Mr. Date from representing private companies before the CFPB or the Federal Reserve for two years after his departure. Mr. Date said he might advise Circle on compliance with regulations but has no plans to advocate for the company before any regulators.
Mr. Date's private-sector work has come under fire from Republicans in the House of Representatives, who say he is trying to profit from his expertise in rules the CFPB has written. But Mr. Date and his co-workers said there is no conflict of interest because they don't lobby on behalf of the companies they advise.
People who follow the industry attribute the rise in bitcoin prices in part to surging demand from China, where a local exchange is drawing trading from around the world. Elsewhere in China, a unit of Internet giant Baidu Inc. started accepting bitcoin for payment a few weeks ago.
Investors have poured $18 million since September into the BitCoin Investment Trust, a bitcoin-dedicated investment vehicle, surpassing the fund managers' goal of raising $10 million by the end of the year. The trust is a unit of SecondMarket, a New York company that facilitates the trading of stocks before their initial public offerings.
"There is a lot of demand, and it's coming from high-net-worth individuals and institutions," said Jaron Lukasiewicz, whose fledgling New York-based bitcoin exchange, Coinsetter, opened for business Wednesday.
Prices also are being supported by a crackdown on illegal activities that have been tied to the virtual currency and by increased regulatory scrutiny. Such measures help make bitcoin more legitimate, enthusiasts say.
Experts warned that bitcoin is thinly traded on the many exchanges that traffick in it, which can lead to big price swings.
A Senate subcommittee is scheduled to hold a hearing Monday on virtual currencies. That comes after a unit of the Treasury Department earlier this year issued guidelines that said virtual-currency exchanges are subject to the same anti-money-laundering requirements that apply to traditional money-transmission businesses, like Western Union Co.

You all don't understand - for the price to rise it is sufficient that people don't sells. For example when the price is rising, usually people tend to hold, so it stimulates the rise more, because the law of supply and demand doesn't work with btc, you can't produce more

Chinese usually are paying ?% to get money to Hong Kong or other countries. So it is not so easy to "sell on btcchina, convert yuan to USD or Euros, and buy on bitstamp"
But may be if there is a permanent difference some local players (who curently do this transfer for 5%) will start to catch up and this will be VERY good thing for bitcoin, because this mafia manages all half-legal money transfers from China. If they finally realize how easy they can do it via Bitcoin, this can spread like a wildfire. And Chinese can be very quick in getting things done. So buckle up.

Russian government the same as Chinese wants to run away from USD. USD is not collapsing by itself. US is collapsing and it prints billions of UDS to support the consumption of resources. So Russia and [China]( took a stand of not interfering with bitcon, letting it be. So far Russia is very soft on bitcoins. You just can not fucking imagine how tough is to be a ecurrency operator in Russia.

Bitcoin is unpredictable, if you invest, the better strategy is plan for 3-5 years. And be ready also to say good-bye to your money. There are different possibilities why this can happen, better technology or defect in software, blockchain fork. 
But all the sharks like Amazon, Alibaba, Taobao etc are watching same as you, they want to make sure it is a reliable technology and here to stay. And they want to be the first to get clients. They don't want the fame of the most technologically retarded web-site.
So you can see what a simple discussion between big guys can do to the price, imagine if some of these big shots decide to adopt it.
And I would start with bitstamp.net and later move the btc to an offline wallet
And I can't stress enough
* use 2-step login always!!!! Plan what will happen if you loose you smartphone
* Remember inputs.io. Don't fall for a nice web-site. If you need to keep your btc online for few days I would rather choose mtgox or bitstamp (these guys are multimillion ventures) (with 2-step login of course)
* before moving big amounts to an exchange or offline wallet, test with few dollars in and out several times. Make sure you really good at getting you btc back.
* read the security wiki. Don't use mobile apps for transfer
That's what I think is essential, I am sure you will find better guidelines here.

Bitcoin is a killer when it comes to cross-border, that's why I have suspicion that the volumes are related to export/import. There are people who move millions daily to Hong Kong, for 0.5%, but the hassle is that you have to contact them, somehow pass them cash or deposit etc
This can be so powerful, that you don't need anything else.

How can this be a scam if in was on the China Telecom's page?? Just now they are busted, may be will close down.

but why do you need to buy/sell in the first place? What intention drives you?

[China is standing on the knees and sucking Uncle Sam's dick]( Do you think they are happy to pay back US the revenue in the form of debt? But they have no choice, because they are exporters, they need customer.
At the same time they are exploring other options with [Russia]( and [Iran]( etc. But US is the fattest customer, that's why they don't wont to freak out too much.
That's why I think was all the flirt with bitcoins, they see it as a perfect export tool. But then they never want to go too fast, and that's a good thing may be. They want to wait because they value public opinion, they don't want to recommend a tool that later can collapse and everybody would tell WTF, govt, didn't you do your research before showing us it on TV

we have been there, the history is very simple - founded by Sr. Raffles, heroin dealer, was a herooin hub sipping heroin to China until revolution. Now washing money for all the drug-lords around, caning for graffiti, 25 years for oral sex, death for pot, money is god (that's why bitcoin is free for the moment)
The most valued quality is loyalty, being smart is

yeah? and then they sell all at once? thank you this is what is killing bitcoin.  
I had 30 customers, if all were doing like me, we would have already won the world

very simple, you go to MtGox's office, take a queue number and they give you the rate. If  the queue is long the rate will be lower, so better come on Monday morning
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:18:33
that's why MtGox with 2-factor is Ok or paper wallet for bigger amounts

if they can they steal everything - old shoes, bicycles, pots. It's just that they are scared. Everything in Singapore is being held together only by fear. People are like vegetables

okcoin is saying about 180 successful deposits 
I just can't find where to deposit

if you buy pants and the label says 100% linen, but they are 100% synthetic, they are 100% from China

there is nothing horrible in Black Market Rate, it's natural market rate. 
Go yourself and check it out, just walk into any Arab store and say I want to buy/sell usd. They usually have a big shot around there who handles big transactions. They won't cheat you usually because life in Venezuela costs 200$ and they are there with their families.
As I said in every city there are a lot of traders, who accept deposits in bolivars and would give you cash usd or transfer to the account of your choice.
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:08:55


not sure how big is it 
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:12:48
ha, this is China, we will see
Also somebody posted here that they do deposits to btc38
You see in China there are many groups in government, they fight for reforms and tighten up all the time
Otherwise how the fuck it was all over state TV all the time??
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:45:33
this is too far fetched
when money comes from Bitsamp it will come from some company with a fancy name, no issues here

you need to search for people with fat karma, they are the most right ones and never argue with them

no it's btcchina
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:21:04
