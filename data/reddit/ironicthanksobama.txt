I read this article and all that I can think:
"Let's get cnn.com, cbc.ca, wired, gawker, motherboard, valley wag and a bunch of other reputable outlets to post a link to this."
If this…journalist (this seems to be the wrong word)... stands by her story, surely she must be willing to hear the valid criticisms that come with her newly found '15 minutes of fame'? (sarcasm intended).

Unfortunately, I think your attitude towards Litecoin is quite similar to anybody who talks shit about Bitcoin. You are entitled to your opinion though.
LTC has a strong development community, avoids SHA-256 and provides equivalent functions to BTC. Additionally, among scrypt coins, it is the most secure coin ( which is an added incentive to some of the fiat-fanatics (original term!) among our community.
I look at it this way: BTC is gold. What is LTC? Silver. Your perspective seems to state that in this new cryptocurrency-world, we can only have 1 type of currency... all hail the all powerful BTC! (sarcasm intended).
If you guys think that BTC will keep gaining in value to the point where it reaches a few thousand dollars per coin, it becomes annoying for a consumer having to deal with values in with a decimal, followed by 4-5-6 zeroes, then a few more digits. LTC provides an alternative for mainstream lower-cost purchases.
Anyways, thanks for listening. Hope I wasn't too hostile.
