No affiliation here, just happy that there is now a place other than igot.com where I can purchase Bitcoin in Australia without having to pay 10% GST on the BTC price.
...Which would actually mean if I buy a t-shirt with that BTC, the t-shirt would also attract 10% GST - which means I would have been getting double taxed at a rate of 20%! 
Well done Independent Reserve, well done! I am signing up immediately.
Say goodbye Coinjar, sorry but you need to change with this new GST ruling to stay alive I think.

After waiting 7 days for my level 2 access which would allow me to withdraw more than .05 BTC a day, I have just made a 'send' transaction to 'send' my BTC purchased from igot.com to another address.
Now I receive an email stating:
"Please note, we save all Bitcoin offline and manually process each withdrawal. It can take anywhere between 24 hours to four business days."
What!? Really? I just waited 7 days to be able to make the withdraw, now I have to wait *up to* another 4 business days? It might as well be 100 years in the world of BTC. What a joke. NOWHERE on the site was it made clear this was going to be the case.
Well I am sorry but I will not sue the igot.com service anymore. Off to the Independent Reserve for me, who also does not charge GST + 1% commission fees. Igot.com I would not mind so much if you made it clearer these were your procedures.
