 I prefer to see a steady increase instead of a big green bar, this means there is no one entering the market, these are just whales reacting/manipulating, that's not sustainable growth
so you can say  the new rich whales destroyed a really promising and their own market because of greed, this is exactly how society works today, i thought bitcoin is something against that system
so everyone hope some big investors to enter the market but they are not interested in any idea or in any revolution, they are only interested in profits and many here got the same attitude but they didn't even notice

It depends on the intention
So I didn't buy them for profit, but for using them
If I didn't sell this would just be stupid, but I wouldn't care if the price would stay the same, or decrease a bit, because the sellers of products have to adapt the actual price nevertheless at the later moment, when it went to 20k, there were and still are more usage for fiat money and later I could easily again buy bitcoin, there is no need to keep them except you are speculating on the price to increase again and make profits

The question is what are people like on about? Do you believe in getting rich with your 1k$ investment? 
In a world runned by making profits, I saw a possibility in bitcoin to break away from this, where people should be credited for their work, not for the role they are playing just for the money and making debt for luxuryshit
I bought some bitcoins so I can use them. As i saw this pumping market i sold them with good profit, everything else would be stupid
now you have the possibility to easily change fiat to bitcoin and use it for payment or to send money and the technology is getting better and more people will use it, but it won't be bitcoin in the future, because there are more efficient cryptocurrencies to do so, so there is no reason for a value like 100k, 50k, 20k
the thing I want to say, there must not be a revolution, but use bitcoin and other currencies for the thing they were invented for
or keep dreaming mr. investor
