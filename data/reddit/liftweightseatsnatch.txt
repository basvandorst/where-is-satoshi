Yeah I meant "I couldn't care less". Being at the bottom threshold of caring and not possibly able to care less.

Could care less. I only use bitcoin to buy steroids :/

Actually almost all websites buying anabolic steroids you have to pay via bitcoin. So no. It's me, hundreds of others I know, and yes Joe Rogan.

Yeah that's the point of the post. What are you getting at?

Coinbase is the easiest and friendliest. ITs a webiste, and also an app for your phone! You can just buy it through there and hold. Or you can set it to buy for you every week. Whatever youd like!

Which is ridiculous because on February 1st I realized I needed some extra cash for a Valentines day gift which I until then, forgot about. So I withdrew like 0.25 bitcoin @ $970.00 USD on coin base and I got it in two days no problems at all. Pending for 48 hours and boom ready to spend.

Awhile. the last time I bought was on New years. Still holding. $250 of it then. and another $250 now. (I really dont have a point in time to sell) I realize now how similar this to gambling.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:24:22
What. 250/1000 is 25% that's all I'm stating. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:33:19
holy crap. that true. From the $1000 mark we're already over 25% of the way to the $2,000.00 mark. O.O

Yeah. Idk any of those people he called out but this... he like kept track and everything for this. Seems a bit over the top but still he was right lol
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:20:36
Agree, I'm new to bitcoin after all the talk of it hitting $1000. Thus i'm sure many are in the same boat as me.

"Uhh it seems this guy who followed like a week ago won. But he didn't answer cause he definitely forgot soooo...."

Try coinbase. I own a small amount via them and they didn't ask for any ID! Just email and banking info and such. They're also very popular, check them out

Wow i bet hes so sad in his Porsche and getting tears all over his new Rolex.

Absolutely wild compared to stocks. I'm very new to this but this seems like straight up gambling. Its fluctuated hundreds of dollars in a week.
