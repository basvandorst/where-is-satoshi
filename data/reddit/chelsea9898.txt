Still trying what one? At the moment all it is is a form of currency. You can buy and sell it and pay for things with it. What else can you do with it? Please enlighten me, go on.

The fee doesn’t matter at all really. But what can he or she actually do with that bitcoin? 
They can sell it, buy stuff with it or move it. Nothing else. Or have I missed something?
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:06:04


What other means? There’s really only two other means, wire or cheque. A cheque actually costs zero though it would take a few days to clear. And if you had that amount of money a bank would cut you a very good deal to send it by wire. Probably extremely small as well as it’s only digits on a computer screen.
Read the reply *man* as it’s perfect sense.

A billionaire can just tell his secretary to call someone to arrange it. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:16:59
Wire transfers and cheques work for *everyone*, though the caveat is of course, you have to have a bank account.
However, there aren’t many people selling bitcoin on the street for cash so you still really need a bank account to get any anyway.
And a short while ago tx fees were fucking stupid high and the tx itself took hours. More expensive and more time than banks.
So what else can you do with bitcoin? 
Ps: I own 0.8 of one.
@_date: 2018-10-15 22:34:03
It wouldn’t be impossible at all. 
Yes it would cost a lot more, but if you have that amount of money, they make much more money off you in other ways than transfer fees so I can’t image it being huge. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 22:37:35
If you had enough wealth to send this same amount in fiat no one would stop it and it would go through.
It’s very easy at the moment so send millions of dollars by wire, it’s done very quickly. I arranged a deal recently and the guy who happens to be a billionaire had €128k euros sent and delivered in about 15 minutes. Wouldn’t have cost him much at all, €20? 
Yes there was a middle man, his banker, but no bad players at all.

How? are we all in danger of a fucked up socialist society that much that we need to find ways to get our money out of it that doesn't involve banks?
In the UK we are in danger of it actually, Corbyn has yet to denounce Maduro, oh, and he's also refusing to support the ban on hezbollah as a "political" organisation as well as the terrorist one everyone knows they are.
***Buy bitcoin, because socialism is dangerous***
New tagline right there chaps and chapettes.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:34:28
oh yawn. a remainiac leftard. what a fool. socialism is a mental illness and it seems you have it.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:39:35
i think you'll find that they are terrorists so you're either wilfully ignorant and don't know what you're talking about, or you support a regime which uses suicide bombing and kills innocent people.
ISIS are muslims and kill other muslims and are terrorists.
Hezbollah are muslims and kill other muslims and are terrorists.
It's quite simple to understand really.
You should read the wiki link provided in reply to you and educate yourself and stop supporting and sympathising with terrorists.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:55:14
You don't like it that I criticised your mental illness? You started on me and told me to fuck off and I'm the arsehole? Wow, twisted. But then, socialists are aren't they?
Your opinion means nothing to me at all, but you seem a bit triggered by what I've said, so I reiterate, I hope you have a tasty accident on your bike and please do fuck off to Germany. It's just a shame there's no cure for "socialist".
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:50:33
So you imply that all the high positions in finance have come about because of jobs for the boys and not merit? i disagree with that completely and know someone who disproves that theory completely.
How the hell is bitcoin going to "dismantle the military industrial complex" and bring peace? what does that even mean? How can a virtual decentralised currency do that at all? I've listed above whats possible with it at present. buy it, sell it, buy a limited amount of real world stuff with it, hodl it and hope it goes up. It can do nothing else. What you said makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-02-23 16:12:34
Believes in bitcoin how? As a store of value? What does it do? you can buy it and sell it and buy stuff with it and exchange it out for fiat. Am I missing something? I know it's limited to 21m, but, believe in it for what?
I own almost a whole coin, and I believe in it as something I hope will increase in value (though I don't know why it should really) and make me a profit.
@_date: 2019-02-27 15:10:21
It's not an insult if it's true, lefty remainiac retard.
Cya, prick.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:48:25
oh, unlike your initial reply, yes? If I wanted to hear from an arsehole (and I can tell you're foreign as you spelled it as "ass") then I would have farted.
Here's hoping you have a tasty accident on your bike, retard.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:44:45
No. why don't you? preferably to Germany. I reckog you're a remainiac leftard. Am I right? or am I right?
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:50:55
Of course you're confused, you're a retard.
You don't like it that I criticised socialism? Aaw, poor diddums. Socialism is a mental illness and you would appear to have it.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:59:21
Wow, the presumption is strong with you isn't it? But that's true of all socialists who think they're better, superior to everyone else, when in fact they're not. They're twisted people who have a huge, unwarranted, sense of self importance.
Keep believing whatever you like sugartits, I think someone may have just gone past on a bus who gives a shit what you think, but, probably not, as you're not important at all.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:42:19
I think, what you've stated just there, could be defined as rubbish. if you support them, or think they are ok then that is you supporting and sympathising with an organisation that are indeed terrorists and who use suicide bombings which kill innocent people. Quite a despicable line to take really.

Send 0.5 eth to tottenhamareshit.eth and I’ll send you 5 back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:04:59
the thing is, it doesn't do anything. discounting segwit, it's expensive and takes an age to send it. it has first player advantage and thats it.
ethereum will soon take it's crown regarding market cap. also, you can actually build on top of ethereum. you can't do anything at all with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:51:12
ok i will, but as of right now, what can you do on it apart from trade and buy shit with it?
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:28:25
yeah, I didn't notice it at first when i was in front of it though.
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:32:27
well if they're over 100 years old then yes!
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:51:03
You mean crypto kitties? Oh yeah sorry, there’s a bitcoin version of that Isn’t there. Can you use bitcoin to vote with? Oh yeah sorry, X factor accepts bitcoins doesn’t it. Can you use bitcoin for legal contracts? Oh yeah sorry, there’s bitcoinlawyersforu.com isn’t there. 
Please, tell me. What exactly can you do with it right now apart from trade it and buy stuff? 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:43:32
Bitcoin blockchain doesn’t do much at all apart from move coins back and forth and to a fro. Ethereum On the other hand has real world uses and there’s a shit load of dApps on the way this year and early next. It will be a game changer.

i own bitcoin and tentatively did some mining when the ledger was about 4gb many years ago on a shitty laptop. but still, what does it do? like right now, what can you do with it?
@_date: 2018-04-14 08:10:42
Huh? You *can* actually do all that with eth.  Tell me, go on, what can bitcoin do?  Go on, tell me.
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:04:21
They also take Ethereum and I asked the guy and he said they'll take most crypto currencies.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:48:33
Does bitcoin have smart contracts? Nope. Can you build applications on it? Nope. Can you use it to vote with? Nope. Can you use it to track humanitarian aid? Nope. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:51:55
haha! i might try and sell that to him as a tag line! if he buys I'll share some satoshis with you!
