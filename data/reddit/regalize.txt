Its not really a problem when alot of mining farms are located pretty much at power plants. And simply use the electricity that otherwise would have been wasted.  Because alot of power plants serve a few cities depending on the size. Lets say that the power plant generate 20-30% more electricity than the cities need. This electricity in most cases wont be stored in batteries or sent somewhere else. It would just disappear somehow (dont know how power plants deals with this) 
Soo instead they can sell dirt cheap electricity to mining farms and make a few bucks, win-win.
Also im sure that most banks also use alot of electricity, its just that noone think about it.

Personally i think Bitcoin will need to change the algorithm, but its not as soon as 1-2 years id rather say 5-10years or maybe 15-20 years. 
 
There are three issues with the current algorithm, its kind of centralized with Big companies like Bitmain controlling who gets hardware ect (also pushing bcash at the same time) 
Then its the power usage, its probably gonna get better in the upcoming years, but it could be greatly reduced by making it Asic resistant.
The last thing is that it might need to be Quantum resistant when  Quantum computers gets more acessible to the public. 
All of this will probably be in one hardfork + a block upgrade. But i dont see it anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:06:41
If u use mycryptobuddy it takes difficulty into account :) Average difficulty increase is about 12% i think :) so u can get a pretty accurate estimate.  But then again its not worth buying with BTC at this price :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:24:17
Id love to see 5k again, that would be god giving us another shot at getting rich. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:59:43
Why will u lose money overall? ROI is about 4 months if i remember correctly
Edit: It would be a bad idea to buy with BTC at this point, would be better off buying with BTC at 20k+
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:25:13
50BTC? Deal.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:49:08
If u got the public adress, u can check if theres anything on it simply by pasting the adress in the search bar at blockchain.info

Lol, gotta do this with my gf's salt lamp. Wonder if she would notice 
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:30:59
Thats ur opinion i guess. If ur in crypto to make fast profit why do you even care. Myself like many others are in crypto for lifetime, and Core is doing a great job at focusing on long term.  If u cant wait for LN to be properly tested to work flawless, u might aswell just jump on the Bcash train.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:31:12
Well, Core is working. And the Lightning Network will launch this year when its properly tested and ready for the mainnet. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:49:09
Litecoin will probably get it first too
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:08:14
If they accept LN, chances are that they are connected to a hub :)

If u truly have 1k btc, please send 0.4 Btc to help me join the 1/21000000 club.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:26:01
The btc is perfectly safe in the coin (unless stolen ofc) u can check if the bitcoin actually is in there on this site  by entering the code on the back (public key) in form of **A7Aj6xY** or so.  U can probably add an extra 500-1k on top of the btc price since its collector object(if its loaded)  :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:25:45
Yup :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:41:31
10btc for every1 incoming
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:58:38
Well, its determined by the amount of transactions in a block. When u have seen 3 transactions per second, its probably because it was a block with very low amount of Segwit transactions, and opposite on the 10tps :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:39:58
According to a post on bitcointalk, if u didnt claim ur btc before january 2014, the company considered the btc as a donation. Sorry buddy :/

[this is why we say hodl]( 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:48:18
Bitcoin itself in digital form, probably not.
Casascius physical bitcoin, already is :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:37:29
Its possible with trezor atleast
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:40:00
Im in the same boat, student aswell.. got 0.6btc atm, that i slowly accumulated from may this year.. but 1 btc seems very far away now, haha :)
Maybe the .6 will be enough to pay off my student loans tho, if we continue at this rate :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:27:10
If it has a good graphics card it can mine. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:39:50
No, it was encouraged by greedy miners and business men. Which most of the community dont want to be in charge of bitcoin development.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:01:39
If u had a wallet back in 2009, chances are u had a bit more than 1 btc :) if u doubt its anything there u can pm me the info and i can check, hehe ;)
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:55:41
About 1800$ :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:33:08
Go ahead and make ur own forks at forkgen.tech bois, haha
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:20:56
Do you have the URL? (Dont post it)
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:07:18
Maybe i didnt express it correctly, but what i meant was that if he were to sell it now, he could probably get anywhere from 500-1000$ extra on top of btc price since its a casascius coin :) 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:46:01
For direct bitcoin mining yes, but he can use nicehash and get paid in bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:35:33
I live in Norway tho. So it probably will take longer to get to you. It said they are shipping from France. But it will be way faster then Ledger anyways :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:06:18
Im from Norway. I find it easier to use USD due to 1 USD being about 8 NOK.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:56:33
Was going to, but they arent shipping before 30.Sept.. and trezor is shipping instantly
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:11:23
I were goin to buy a ledger aswell, but then i saw shipping 30.sept and 7-20 days delivery, and im like fuck no.
So i ordered a Trezor instead, this is 1,5 days ago and the trezor is scheduled to arrive later today :D
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:16:24
I havent used a bitcoin atm personally, but i believe u have to scan a ID there aswell? Atleast on some atms. Might depend on which country ur from 
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:49:38
Yeah, here in Noway we have DHL. Which deliver it right at ur door or at a local pickuppoint :) Im sure its something similar in Canada, if not the same. U also get a code to track the package, yes :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:25:45
Bitcoin diamond will have a max supply of 210m tho..  so maybe they 10X ur holdings.. idk. Might just be for them to get some free cash.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:38:30
Yes, and thats why the price of bitcoin has gone up so much lately :) but u only get both if u own ur own private key (example: exchanges keeps keys for you) then u need to find out what the exchange's stance is on the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:39:26
He/she found ur private keys
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:51:16
Ofcourse it will drop after the fork, lol. Anyone thats been into bitcoin for more than 2 weeks knows that.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:22:25
And by attacks u mean..? Forks? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:08:38
Oh sweet summer childs, the real dip is after the 16th. And i belive we might go as low as 4500$ before rocketing against 10k (personal thought)
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:58:43
Use nicehash. It will always mine the most profitable coin. U will probably make 1-1,5$ a day.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:20:24
From Norway aswell, and i just use Coinbase and Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:23:34
But what do you need it for..?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:36:55
Alot of ppl would say this is an attack, but i wouldnt. It was natural with a drop now.. i also belive it will drop to low 5000 before it rockets against 10k. 
And about BCH, id say its just another Pump and Dump, as a reaction on 2X being canceled. 
This is my personal opinion.  And due to me saying bitcoin will drop a bit, butthurt newcomers will downvote this comment.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:37:44
What do you need it for?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:20:04
Im not an expert in any way, but if 2X would have gone trough and become the new "Bitcoin" , my guess is that the amount of transactions would go up, due to the cheaper fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:59:59
Enlighten me where u can buy bitcoin for less than 1$ fee then, broski.
Where its not already overpriced bitcoin that is.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:39:00
U should buy atleast 10-20$ because the fees for buying will cost more than 1$
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:23:44
Why cash in..? Ppl would probably buy it for more than the value inside.. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:55:59
Just due to rapid growth, and past history. Ex. When it dropped from 3500 ish to 1800ish, and 5400 ish to 2800 ish. I dont think 7500 ish to 5000 ish is not a bad correction, might even hit 4k.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:17:20
I just hope no1 can somehow steal bitcoin if they get the locks open.. i can pick open a masterlock like that in less than 4 seconds with 2 paperclips..
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:01:23
Bigger blocks = More transactions = more fees
On average they probably profit even more than they do with current  fees, even though their higher
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:18:30
Well, btc was at about 3k at that time tho.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:29:56
Damn, seems like you can find them OP.. fingers crossed!!
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:22:11
Why wouldnt ppl sell after getting the free money they wanted in the first place..?  Alot of money will go back into alts. Aka there will be a dip. 
Oh sweet redditor for 1 week.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:49:40
Probably keep dipping. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:53:58
I think ive read something about a scam site being the first thing to pop up when googleing blockchain. Blockchain.info is the correct one atleast, and if u tried to log in on blockchain.com, thats probably why ur funds are gone :/
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:18:33
This man gets it. How can ppl think that a 100-200$ drop is a correction? Lul. Mark my words, we will see 4k again after fork.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:27:24
Why would you only buy a dollar..?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:58:41
I dont know any that mass-convert. But i do know programs that can generate new. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:20:12
My guess is from around 8000 to 4500.  And every pleb will panic sell. And media will declare bitcoin dead for the 900th time, then bitcoin will rocket to 10k+. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:42:07
The 34 digit key seems to be what allows ppl to send you bitcoin (u can check that if there are any bitcoin there) . The 15 digit passphrase is what gives u access to the bitcoins, the private key, but it is encrypted. U will need to find out what kind of encryption, and ur passphrase + public key(34digit) should give you the acutal private key u need to recover the wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:50:02
Im hoping that aswell m8, we are overdue for a real correction :) 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:33:27
Woot, just noticed. The correction is coming earlier then i guess..
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:40:42

i believe breadwallet uses Coinbase, so it would probably just be easier to download the coinbase app, and buy on there. Then just send the bitcoin to the breadwallet :) 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:11:14
I dont have any more fiat :'( 
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:38:48
How do you know ur private key got leaked? I did the exact same thing as you, and my BTC was fine. Only my BCH was sent to CEX.io.
I believe u just accidentaly sent the BTC aswell to the same wallet, and in that case they will not confirm and will return to ur wallet in 72 hours(?) or so.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:30:14
I dont use CEX.io personally. But for OP i guess it gets the job done, unless you want to name other exchanges that has a app on IOS, i dont know any others.
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:26:12
Are there any cryptosteel knockoffs out there, thats a bit cheaper?
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:24:20
Could work, but that also kind of defeats the purpose of bitcoin? Doesn't it? :s
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:49:03

Alright, probably read some shitpost then
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:01:03
Thx dude, didnt think that much about it. But what if they recover it in Mycelium(ive read that this is a possibility) or some other wallet? Will the PIN element still be there?

@_date: 2017-10-19 06:55:13
U have to set a passcode tho, in order to send ur bitcoins, so u wont lose them if u lose ur phone.  And as soon as u lose it, u should restore ur wallet on ur pc or something else anyways using ur recovery seed
Edit: It really depends on how much bitcoin u have tho. Paper wallet is way better if u got like 0.3btc+

What to do about what? And expect from what? Please be more spesific
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:49:16
There absolutely no reason to use cloud mining at all. Just buy bitcoin instead, much faster and safer. All u basicly do, is paying some1 money to give you back the same amount of money over x amount of months.. if u wanna mine, get a miner urself.
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:45:10
Ledger is great, its considered the best because it can store a few more altcoins than for example Trezor. And is a bit cheaper. Personally i have a trezor and i love it.  It ships instantly aswell. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:36:59
Hmm, that would be nice. But i dont think thats possible when changing the blocksize require a hard fork in the first place :/ but im not an expert at the coding behind bitcoin. Maybe some1 else with more knowledge can clearify things :)

Try recovering it in another wallet? :)
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:53:50
Im not sure. But its no problem to buy on there before the 1st. 
As long as u move it to another wallet
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:27:54
Where do you have your bitcoin atm? Do you have any? And yes, 1-2k is a great investment as long as you can afford it. You should consider getting a hardware wallet tho. Paper wallet is fine, but u would also be fine with mycelium(android) or bread(ios)
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:44:36
Yeah, it works. Its a 375€ limit every week tho.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:01:47
Because its not over 6k at coinbase....?
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:20:53
