Lmao acting holier-than-thou won't make your comments look any less stupid. I need at least 10 more vague blurry pictures to be convinced

Out of all the ways you could have tried to prove this claim, I think "a few blurry pictures of rocks that kind of resemble Earth objects if you cherry pick and use your imagination" is by far the least convincing... This may shock you, but rocks do in fact come in all sorts of shapes.

He's a flat-earther who thinks gravity and space are fake concepts made up to control people. He thinks anything that contradicts this theory is also fake and part of the conspiracy... meaning almost anything related to actual science, education, math, etc. Basically in his delusional mind he's really smart and has everything figured out, while anyone who disagrees even a *tiny* bit is wrong, dumb, evil, and/or brainwashed, no matter who they are

That would be amazing and very hard to dispute! Too bad all you have there is a black splotch five pixels wide that could be pretty much anything. Got anything that constitutes actual evidence?


"Exactly"? Really? I see a normal fucking rock that has, like, a dark spot on it. You know, like rocks do. I could probably cherry pick a blurry picture of a potato that looks kind of like that blurry picture of a rock too.
Do you just take *anything* as proof of massive global conspiracy? Because this is some really weak shit...
