Money Transmitters as defined in the regs are those entities that as a business transfer stored value or perceived value from one individual to another using electronic means for a fee.  It is abundantly clear that the regs are in fact broadly enough defined that transferring Bitcoin by the name Bitcoin or any other name from one individual to another for a fee is Money Transmission.  Using bitcoin to buy goods or services is not "Money Transmission".  This C&amp;D action was carried out by people who did not realize what the Bitcoin Foundation actually does and how it is related to the industry.  Provision of infrastructure including software and hardware and networks are not regulated as Money Transmission infrastructure unless it is a business affiliate of an entity that is a Money Transmitter.  This case will be dismissed very shortly.

With a close connection to the last five CA governors, I know with certainty that Jerry Brown is working to immediately control this issue because he clearly understands the value of the economic engine of tech innovation that provides a huge portion of the state's revenue base and he has a solid understanding of the recent innovations occurring in Silicon Valley around Bitcoin, especially as it relates to those entities with whom Silicon Valley Bank is formally and publicly affiliated with and those in stealth mode also.
Expect to see rapid containment and closure of this issue in public.
