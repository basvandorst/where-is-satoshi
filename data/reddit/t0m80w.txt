He's taking the Lance Armstrong approach to the truth. Sue the shit out of anyone who calls him out as a fraud, and hope it scares off others.
At the end of the day, like Armstrong, he's still a fraud, and history won't be kind to him or his supporters.

Wouldn't that increase the value of USD though? lol
Wait, are you the author of OP's post? Was this all planned??

Maybe he's implying that the $USD will strengthen over the next decade? /s

DataDash is a great YouTube channel.
He's one of the most common sense and well informed vloggers around.
No bullshit, no bias.

First and foremost, I'd try to seek out places which accept payments in BTC/LTC/DASH etc. Reward those businesses for supporting the crypto revolution.
I don't have any experience with localbitcoins or BTC ATM's so can't give any feedback there.
(Lastly, ALWAYS use a secure VPN service when using someone elses network. You may have to go through additional verification steps when you log in, such as email confimation etc, but it's well worth it from a security and privaty standpoint)

No it hasn't.

 twitter feed recently posted a screenshot showing Bcash hashrate increase of 480% vs Bitcoin's increase of 190%. What they're showing is % increase of their current hashrate, NOT % increase of global hashrate being directed to Bcash.
What they neglected to post was the actual real hashrate increase for both coins, in which Bitcoin is almost 1000% higher.

The coins which provide no value to the community will loose value, those which do provide some value to the community will be valued (against BTC) accordingly.

To put this to bed, it's not possible, bitcoin ledger is the most immutable ledger on the planet.  Done.
