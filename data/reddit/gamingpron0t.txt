Mhhm, if you're talking about like future analytics, no. If you're talking about in-depth knowledge, no to that too. I knew on the surface what I could do to start experimenting with it.

The factor of multiple computers mining together won't help?

I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna get a little USB ASIC miner to mess around with it. I mean, normal machines weren't effective in 2013, they're gonna be even worse with the new algorithms.

Pfft. Please. How would I cook my hotpockets if my CPU is cool?

Is GPU mining still effective? I mean Nvidia cards are still priced ridiculously.

Christ. Weren't these pools mostly normal desktop machines a few years ago?

I mean, I pretty much said all my specs. I remember back in 2013 there was an article about BTC Pools, and how they were (more) effective for low power pcs, I'm guessing times have changed drastically?

The last time I researched Bitcoin was 2013. I was not expecting it to change this wildly.

Wasn't joining a pool to make a profit feasible before?

I do have a desktop with a MX150, would that contribute enough to turn out a some BTC or do we need specially designed rigs with multiple high power GPUs on it?
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:29:20
Oh. Fucking hell, didn't even know that. Basically I'd be getting like, 0.5% of the BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:19:43
A Mining pool is where multiple people go and help mine for a bitcoin (loose definition) and then that bitcoin is split between everyone mining. You can't blame me for using the logic and saying, well hey, 50 computers sharing the load won't be as bad as one computer doing it all.

I heard NiceHash was good. Will it work with a ASIC USB miner or would I need a special software used usually for the big miners.
