goldcakes, I think this is different. You can get it to be solved a little bit faster if you have specialized hardware like I mentioned in my other post ( an ASIC that has been cooled with liquid nitrogen and overclocked to hell and back )
but because it is a purely serial computation (its a recursive function that can't be unrolled into a parallelize-able loop) the fastest way to solve it is on one really fast ASIC core. There is no branch-prediction-style  greedy "try everything" computing method that I know of which can help it go faster.
The trick is that there is a technologically imposed limit to how fast that core can be, but if you have more resources, chances are you can build a faster core.
@_date: 2015-06-21 16:51:29
Its because it's a purely recursive function with no algebra that would allow you to break it out into a parallelize-able loop. Once there is an ASIC that does this serial computation in an optimized fashion, mass producing that asic should be cheap (about $10 a chip). And also, due to the way that serial computation works, you can't actually make the process any faster by throwing more hardware at it. You have to increase the clock speed. But if you do that you melt your chip. So you have to design a faster chip. But that is only really possible if you are already one of the big chip companies like intel.
The end result is that you can increase the serial SHA-256 performance with a better asic, and maybe you can cool it with liquid nitrogen to crank up the clock speed. But beyond that its really hard to make it faster.

It could be very profitable for the author if the generator only generates one in a set of 1m known keys.
If you want to generate paper wallets like this and you don't know how to do it yourself, then you also probably don't know how to verify that someone else's tool is legitimate.
Before you put any amount of serious money in a wallet like this, you should be sure that it is actually secure, i.e., there is enough entropy and the PRNG is functioning correctly.

I agree, that their security is exaggerated, but I would like to note that it IS possible for the VM hosting company to be completely trustless. Here's how it works:
Sensitive Data goes into HSM on Coinkite device. Ciphertext comes out.
Ciphertext goes to VM provider.
Ciphertext comes out of VM provider, etc.
However, this HSM sounds like security through obscurity to me. It is possible to build tamper-proof integrated circuits, but very hard to build provably open source tamper-proof ICs. 
In the end, Coinkite probably does hold the master keys to all of their customer's funds. Whether it would be easy for them to steal the funds, and whether they would, is another story.

Most of these bitcoin companies charge lower fees than credit cards have, but like you said it is exactly like paypal or a bank.

Excerpt from the article:




This is a radical position to take, and in a bad way -- it works on some very flimsy assumptions (that income is correlated to ability, for example). 
Income is correlated with one thing... Ability to make money. But money doesn't do anyone any good on its own.  It's a means to an end. Full capitalism conflates profit with productivity. In capitalism, the individual's fitness function does not correlate with the fitness function of the whole. It leads to a tragedy of the commons, or an "evolutionary paradox". Like a peacock, the more profit (tail feather), the more investment (mating and reproduction). You end up with a bird that can't even fly or run because its tail feathers are so massive. You end up with planned obsolescence, food that has no nutritional value, companies spending more on marketing than on their product, ponzi schemes, global warming, etc. You also end up with dangerous corruption in politics.

His entire argument is predicated on the idea that volatility signifies growing and long-term interest in bitcoin, but this is simply not true. Lots of things are volatile, and not all of them generate increasing interest for a long time.
However, I like his explanation that bitcoin is volatile because it's hard to decide on a dollar-price for it. IMO, this is due to the uncertainty of bitcoin's future. However, I have a hard time believing that wide-spread bitcoin adoption wouldn't decrease volatility. What stops everyone from running out to buy things while it's value is increasing, thus reversing the trend to a decrease, causing people to hoard? How does this not yield an equilibrium?

^^^ upvote Zafolo's comment.
What the OP describes is still vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. To solve this, the exchange must send the user his own transaction details through an alternate channel, (Bitmessage is perfect for this), Authy, is decent, and SMS is pretty bad. The user must then confirm the transaction through both browser and bitmessage/authy/sms, and his confirmation must be tied to the transaction details he received. 
This is secure assuming that only the user's machine is compromised, or only his phone is compromised. If both are compromised by the same adversary, it's impossible to have meaningful security.
In other words this is not secure against a nation-state level adversary (NSA).

I think if coinkite were to produce a hardware wallet that actually stores the private key on hardware, instead of an account card, they would be positioned to take over the bitcoin POS market. Their little walled garden account card system is cute, but it lacks the security and interoperability of a private key in your hand.
The centralized nature of the system defeats the whole purpose of bitcoin.

I've been saying this for a while now. Personally, I think that the hardware wallet vacuum is a business opportunity. 
I think the biggest hurdle is the standardization of a "keyless" bitcoin client that only generates signing requests and receives the signed transactions.
After that's done, there are lots of ways to make a hardware wallet. Early prototypes could be based on something like the [teensy]( A production system might be better served by the [Quark processor](
The simplest would only require a small screen. A more advanced wallet would have a built in camera for scanning QR codes.

I think that a $20 hardware wallet the size of a credit card, perhaps compatible with the Square hardware and other POS hardware, will be the killer app for bitcoin. 
Offline transaction signing is the protection consumers need to be able to understand bitcoin and benefit from it.
It just requires new POS software, that is all. And if you can't reprogram the existing POS, just build a new one.
However, this card isn't gonna do it. This company doesn't look like they have their act together at all, and it looks like they are making promises that technically, they just can't keep.

This is very serious tin foil hat security at this point, but for someone who plans to put more than a couple thousand dollars worth of value into bitcoin (or someone who invested early and now has millions), it's definitely worth it to try to figure out ways to eliminate the possibility of malware stealing your private keys.

This Bitcoin primer fails to mention 99% of real-world bitcoin security vulnerabilities.  Sorry to be harsh but I don't think its responsible to introduce people to bitcoin and explain how wonderful it is without also mentioning how dangerous it can be for the uninformed.
   - Viruses and Trojans that steal wallets and passwords.
   - 3rd party wallet provider unauthorized account access
   - 3rd party wallet provider service failure and key leakage
   - 3rd party wallet provider 'inside job' scams
   - insecure wallet generation systems (brain wallet)
   - scam wallet generation systems (some of these could be long cons that are still going on)
   - lost wallet file, no backup
   - lost password, can't access encrypted wallet file
   - typed in the wrong address when sending money
   - attacker injecting attacker address into a merchant or exchange site
You also failed to mention that despite all of these seemingly insurmountable problems, there will be simple solutions for consumers that solve most of them at once.

I don't think that's what bdarmstrong was implying. I think they meant to say that in the event of a fork, they will always enforce the  network rules that the majority of miners enforce. 
I sincerely doubt that miners would intentionally mine some chain with no rules, weaker rules, or rules that are doomed to fail. It would be economic suicide. So, coinbase will always be enforcing some network rules when they accept coins. But they are saying they they are willing to  change those rules when the miners do.

I didn't read the entire article, but it sounds like the Paxos protocol is essentially an error-correcting scheme.
Bitcoin is very different. Bitcoin is all about establishing trust, in a final and total sense. The blockchain is really a new kind of thing that can't be compared to anything else. A good analogy is that the blockchain is "the Trusted cloud" with a very very capital T. But it has extremely low bandwidth and usually you have to pay to use it (tx fees). So its only  really useful for:
  
* Large bitcoin transactions, and 
   
* Applications that really really depend on shared trusted immutable state with a small amount of data. 
However, right now we are in a mad rush to figure out how to turn "Applications that really really depend on shared trusted immutable state with a small amount of data" into all kinds of amazing new products. Namecoin DNS is one of them. Lightning Network is another. Open source internet voting might be next. DACs, etc.
Maybe I should back up a bit. Cassandra is trying to solve a problem on the other end of the scale -- how to build applications that have soft trust which is "good enough" to handle MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA (big data) where a single arbitrator (SQL) might not be reliable or available enough to handle that volume of data.

It depends on your financial needs and reasons for buying in the first place. I never bought more than I could afford to lose and I'm still down from where I bought them -- but I don't think I would sell my BTC if it rose to my entry level; I bought them because I believed in the technology and I wanted to participate in it. Given proper security, you are the only one who can ever spend those 25 bitcoins, and that's the core value proposition behind it. No one can ever stop you from spending them. 
I think bitcoin is only up recently because people are being shown how fragile and potentially dangerous traditional banking is in the latest greek financial meltdown. No one can bail in a bitcoin.

I understand that you wish to remain as anonymous as possible, but to be honest, I don't think the purpose of bitcoin is to allow anonymous payments.  Bitcoin is really really bad for anonymity, especially if you are trying to prevent the authorities from knowing who/where you are, including years down the line.  Every transaction ever made in bitcoin is trace-able forever. In fact, *THAT* is the point of bitcoin. As a consequence, it only takes one record of one transaction to be tied to you, and unless you have made a herculean opsec effort, all your other bitcoin transactions will follow.
It sounds to me like anonymity is a priority for you. In that case, you should be using cash instead of bitcoin.

the problem is it doesnt sign the TX for you like a real hardware wallet would. So its not really any more secure than a paper wallet. It doesn't provide a secure area for signing TX.

Because if bitcoin fails, it will be replaced. It is simply too interesting and too useful. I think that widespread and prolonged internet blackout is the only failure mode for cryptocurrency. In the past, when public key cryptography was just beginning to be understood, the government tried to classify it as a deadly weapon that had to be controlled. I'm sure lots of people thought it would get snuffed out by spooks. Well, these days it is a keystone that keeps our economy running day in and day out. If you take any half-decent class on discrete math, you might encounter some basic, but still very powerful schemes like Diffie-Hellman and learn how they work. That genie is never going back in the bottle, and neither is cryptocurrency. Satoshi's paper is on a lot of different hard drives by now, and probably printed a lot too.
Just be patient -- these things take time. Lots of time. Some people were saying "give it two years" about a year ago, but I'm thinking a lot longer term than that.

Because the only thing that seems to grab the public's attention is when bitcoin gets kicked into a speculative frenzy and gets 1000% gains in a year. And that hasn't happened for while... 
Don't worry. As time goes by, more and more people that I meet have already heard about bitcoin. When I first read about bitcoin, there was no one I could talk about it with.. It was like the slow trickle of reports on NSA mass wiretapping that existed before snowden. No one was paying attention and no one had heard about it. Nowadays I feel like half the people I meet can talk about the NSA without mentioning tin foil hats. And maybe 25% of people in technical circles can talk about bitcoin. It's a big change for just a few years.

bro brandishes bud light and attempts to explain concept of partial hash collision, which he himself does not fully understand.
fails, but still looks "cool" to people who have no fcking clue what is going on

bitcoin kinda runs counter to his argument that "hard money is for soldiers and soldiers alone"
Although it also jives with his "there will be a reset" analysis. 
I really like Graeber's work and ideas, he is very thorough and brings a fresh perspective.

You should use Ƀ. It's a standard character with nothing fancy and it's not currently used by another currency. (฿ is the thai baht)

TBH if i was going to store bitcoin on some private key, I wouldn't even want to take a photo of it in the first place, regardless of how much I could blur it later.
I generated my private keys offline and wrote them down on paper by hand :\

Because Bitcoin is a protocol, not a specific program. Although many people use Bitcoin Core (bitcoind) there are lots of other implementations, and there are so many full nodes. If I hacked an exchange or mining pool, I could maybe steal a few thousand dollars. But my hack would be specific to that exchange, pool, or implementation of bitcoin. 
Your question is similar to the question "Every program can be hacked, so how do people have so much confidence in SSL and x.509?" 
In the case of heartbleed, a vulnerability was found in a very very common version of OpenSSL. That obviously shook people's confidence in SSL and x.509. But the reality is that it's all we have, it was patched quickly, and it takes a lot of effort to safely extract value from a software vulnerability like that. The impact of heartbleed was a lot less than many people expected. 
A break in Bitcoin definitely would be easier to extract value from than a break in OpenSSL. But, as perverse as it seems, there might actually be more security scrutiny on the Bitcoin code that is signed and delivered via SSL, than there was on OpenSSL itself.
In the past, problems with bitcoin (chain forks, etc.) have been resolved with cooperative manual intervention. The amount of transferred value lost was minimized and the system was "rebooted from a backup" so to speak. That could happen again in the event of a hack that threatens bitcoin's existence. 
Also, some elements of bitcoin, like the SHA256 proof of work mining algorithm, are governed by physical limits (thermodynamics) and formal proofs in information theory.  No one has ever found a SHA256 duplicate pre-image. That specific component of bitcoin should be considered un-hackable. As far as we know, even a theoretical quantum computer would not help an attacker get around it. 
Also, as a final piece, maybe people actually don't trust the specific bitcoin software as it runs by default on the OS on their system. So they bend over backwards to generate keys offline and transmit transaction data out of band, that is, not on the network, because they don't trust the hardware and OS that the bitcoin software runs on. But they can still use bitcoin even though their "trust in the program" is limited. In fact, this is primarily how enterprises use bitcoin. They manage it with vaults and physical air-gap security around the core components that hold most of their bitcoin. Enterprises that don't do this will be weeded out over time, Mt.Gox for example.

What a science fiction universe where you order a drink for 5 microbits, or micros.
Imagine parents having to explain to their children why its called that, and explaining the SI units system along the way. Cute :)

His girlfriend probably gonna leave him when/if he ever hands her that golden necklace, just from identity shock and the amount of lying he had to do.
Hope he likes hookers and blow lol. This is the worst kind of person... Bitcoin isn't exciting because it can be used to buy luxury goods. Bitcoin is exciting because it can redefine entire markets and economic practices. I would think early bitcoin adopters would be cashing out to start companies, not this BS. 
I don't think the pornowealth fetish on this sub is good for the future of bitcoin....

Coinbase is pretty easy. You have to verify your identity of course.

I honestly don't understand why people use large corporate banks like BoA, Citi, etc. Why not use your local credit union?

I'm in a similar situation, but I think that I have greed for a good reason. I'm 21, I came from lower middle-class background, and I really want to start a green building construction business after college. 
I feel like I could do good for the world if I just had a little investment money. I got in later than you did, but I'm still hoping my investment pays off and can at least help pay off my college debt.
So, I'm not the biggest libertarian or capitalist, but I think when you have knowledge and good intentions, greed can be good, it's more about will to create than will to dominate.

And then, after satoshi donates a few mBTC to everyone who applies, the NSA backdoors open on millions of machines, sending 50% of the world's BTC to Citibank's cold wallet.
miners try to resist these transactions and rewind the chain, but the transactions keep coming, with better and better obfuscation, and the blockchain becomes so unstable that it is impossible to transact.

The price is irrelevant, you can buy $1 of bitcoins if you want. However, if you believe that the value will decrease, maybe buying later will be better.

I think that DIY MONEY is one of the biggest reasons people like bitcoin. As long as there discontent with the government and big banks, and as long as the US economy is doing poorly, there will be demand for bitcoin.

Most of the applications he's talking about are many, many years off I think, but it's quite exciting to think about. I'm not sure that the public is ready for this much cryptography, lol.

Private keys in facebook messages? this is about as bad of an idea as it gets, security-wise.
