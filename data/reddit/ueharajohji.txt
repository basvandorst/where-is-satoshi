Warren Buffet got rich by playing safe. I am planning to cash out at a certain price regardless of what will happen in 2030.

@_date: 2017-12-24 23:35:59

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:20:25
what mess ? you guys make everything a big deal , we all know bitcoin will hit 100k next year. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:46:20
my mom calls it bitbomb and it is not because she can't read , it's because she is a hodler and she knows it will reach another ATH anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:59:13
ask the Linconln lawyer to do the justice for you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:26:58
He is been living here for like 7 years.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:19:38
If you are getting it on your forehead I am willing to give 0.01 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:00:08

just kidding man. You da man OP!
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:35:28
I don't know much about immigration process so I will just pray for him.
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:21:33
why didn't he die from that impact?
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:36:06
you call that a rollercoaster ? LOL , i have witness bitcoin go from 9k to 18k in weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:54:39
I will be 73 years old by that time. I don't think I will benefit that much by the time I hit 70s.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:12:41
dude you should up those numbers.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:15:11
How much tax would I need to pay if I already gain 10k usd by just owning 2.5btc?
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:15:10
I'm a bitcoin investor but your comment is too cringey.
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:09:32
a person with a BIID would gladly do it for free.
@_date: 2018-03-05 11:58:43
 Have you ever been to Indonesia or Philippines ? People there pay huge amount of taxes but never gets the quality of life that you mentioned.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:50:52
that is impossible but I want some 2k usd bitcoins lol.
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:36:25
just take care of your own hardware wallet. smh
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:57:57
It is obvious that he FOMO'ed at 20k$ and panic sold at 6k$ LOL.
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:10:52
what if it hits 999,999$ , will he still eat his own cock?
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:40:17
Mila Kunis is ugly as fuck.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:45:23
I want me some 5k bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:11:25
the cost of mining + the amount of buy walls per correction makes it impossible to even drop at 7k
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:52:27
That is possible since there are 7 billion people in the world.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:14:23
that is a good idea OP.
@_date: 2018-03-20 05:09:50
that is because I sold .
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:19:59
Hire someone to slap you every time you try to sell your holdings. Best investment ever.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:58:52
you sit back and relax.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:28:11
salty no coiner.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:29:34
I was hodling like it was nothing when it dropped to 5.9k lol.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:04:32
just sell it in dollars then buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:05:12
if it hits 1 million he can get a world class penile reattachment surgery.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:37:08
that rollercoaster guy doesn't look like he is having fun.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:18:11
Death notes, they are real.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:59:37
Nah , I wouldn't be surprised even if it hits 15k by next week.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:09:19
buy a condo worth of 150k usd. I will achieve that once bitcoin hits 50k.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:04:23

@_date: 2018-04-24 02:34:05
