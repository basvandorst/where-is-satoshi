fair. could you help me wrap my head around this a bit?
13. How will the Bitcoin futures daily settlement price be determined?
Initially, daily settlement will be based on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of CME Globex trades between 3:59:00 p.m. and 4:00:00 p.m. London Time1 rounded to the nearest tradable tick.  CME will reassess the daily settlement process as the Bitcoin futures market matures.
They're trading something they aren't required to produce, and metric they're using to settle it is a product of what other people are trading that they cannot produce, correct?

from what i understand this is cash settled. which means at the end of the day. no bitcoins change hand. i'm curious as to how exactly they derive the price (i'm sure it has to be in a prospectus somewhere), but no *actual* bitcoins are changing hands. it's ripe for bullshit

i'm not to whom you're replying but do you know if there's a prospectus that I can tell how it's settled? it's it a cumulative of exchanges, is it a single exchange price at date/time, like... this just seems like potential fuckery to me
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:23:06
but they don't have to buy a real underlying to settle that's the fucking problem

i got this far:
'CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR)
The BRR aggregates the trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges during a specific calculation window into a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin. Calculation rules are geared toward a maximum of transparency and real-time replicability in underlying spot markets.
CME Group and Crypto Facilities Ltd. designed the BRR around the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks.'
at  but for the life of me i cannot find *which exchanges*
I'm mainly curious as to if any of the exchanges have other currency pairs like CNY/BTC or in particular interest is USDT/BTC or if any have a track record of wash trading as the V in volume weighted adjusted averages is of interest
EDIT: nevermind found 
Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken are the constituent exchanges that currently contribute the pricing data for calculating the BRR.

same thing happened to me. this is on gox's end 100%

Same thing happened to me.  They purchased btc with my balance and withdrew it to another address. The reset email was never read, my gmail has 2FA and I was offline and it shows no activity during the time.

I did not have 2FA on my gox account (I had recently lost my smart phone w/ authenticator and had to take it off)

just chiming in here, I had the same thing happened to me.
100% my password reset email was either captured coming from gox (via sendgrid... 3rd party API for email), or the secret for the password reset link was sufficiently easy to predict.
the attack took over 24 hours, and I lost ~5000usd from it. Gox support has not commented.
post here: 
i went to bitcoin talk to post, but I do not have the account requirements.
just posting as a PSA to everybody that definitely your account is not safe w/ mtgox if your email address is known (or predictable), and you are not using 2FA
