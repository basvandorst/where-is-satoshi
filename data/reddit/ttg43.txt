Lol. Come here and try to run your bitcoin atm or to accept btc in your store -- you'll be smashed by the police and tax sevice.

@_date: 2017-01-07 22:22:34

Answering on this questions we can realize what we should do to make bitcoin stronger and more independent.

+1 for segwit and core. Ver, viabtc and others - fack off already, go and mine your own coin with your own rules.

For all human's history was produced about 161 000 tonns of gold. Let's imagine that 61k was lost, so we have 100 000 tonns for now. Price per kg is about $39 000.
So let's calculate btc price if all gold holders decide to move their assets into bitcoin.
100 000 000 * 39 000 / 16 000 000 = 243 750
Of course my calculation are too simplified, but if only 1% of gold holders will move in btc price of coin will go above 2k usd.

You are saying fees are high just because you dont know what you are paying for. Decentralized, private payment network worth it.

Nope, he was buying bitcoin (he said that). Titles are not correct. If he was buying it using bitcoin what for he put money in?

As i see it the difference is in logic and can be provided by answering questions what? how? who?
In first point we getting the answer on question "What we want to develop?"
In second point we getting the answer on question "What we dont want to bitcoin become?"
In third point we getting the answer on question "How bitcoin should be developed?"
In last point we getting the answer on question "By whom bitcoin should be developed?"
imho, ofcourse.

Btcc is signaling segwit too - already 3 pools (20% of hashrate). Dont panic, be patient.

In Russia im using Changebot in telegram - p2p exchange without verification. There are few orders in usd - maybe will be option for you.
@_date: 2016-11-14 21:32:55
I cant agree with you in point about elite's money. When LN will be improved you will pay for transactions much lesser than now imho.
@_date: 2016-12-06 10:20:13
Not recommended for use. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 11:29:51
Second pool that supports segwit is bitclub network - block 439502 with segwit signal
@_date: 2016-09-25 16:47:42
Like coinb.in wallet. For me its like digital paper wallet - very smart algorithm.
@_date: 2016-09-10 12:59:50
We already have p2p alternative to lbc in Russia - telegram bot (fast, secure, with no fees). Relax and use it.
