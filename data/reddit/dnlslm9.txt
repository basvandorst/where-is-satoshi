It was probably because eBay bought out paypal. By letting Google Wallet offer 0% transaction fee they risk making google wallet popular and paypal thus less popular.

Ya atm i dont have money with them its the fact they dont post it on the site that might have them freaking out.

I see everyone says its dumb but i think its actually quite a good idea if you follow the price and notice trends and buy and sell acordingly it could be a great source of income something else you could do is use it to buy a mining contract but thats even riskier.
