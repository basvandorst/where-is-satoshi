I'm still pretty new to bitcoin but this idea crossed my mind.
My question is, what happens if the thief decided to randomly give away, say 10000 bitcoins to hundreds of other people who have nothing to do with the heist. Sure, it probably might signify a loss for the thief, but wouldn't that cause a major confusion for the people following the thief? 
Some random guy getting a 50BTC deposit on his active wallet would seem kinda fishy by itself and everyone would blame him, but what if other 199 people get similar deposits? How could you spot those who are involved and those who are innocent?

yeah right

I see!
And what if the thief decides that, after tumbling, part of the coins would end up in random wallets that aren't his? Would it complicate at all the hunt for the perpetrator? Think of how a real life criminal would leave the gun used killed someone in someone else's purse. Or if some of the stolen bitcoins were sent to Tomas' wallet, your wallet, my wallet, along with the other bitcoins being sent to other "suspects."

I remember reading one where they made a guy write down a whole Harry Potter book by hand. Replicating every line exactly the way it was on the book. Then scanning everything (page by page) and sending them through email or something.
