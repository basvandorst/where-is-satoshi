That is literally not what I said at all. What an awful perception of my intended meaning. Or perhaps I should have said it better, as our statements are only as good as they’re perceived.
Everyone is responsible for their own doings, in success and failure. Responsible for their own life, be it great or dreadful. This is true in investing as it is in all of life. There is very very little in each of our beautifully complex lives that is not of our own fault, directly or indirectly.

No worries my man!

Would I tell my wife about every time I defecate? No.
Would I share a financial decision with her, no matter how small? Yes.
For the life of me I’ve never been able to understand that train of thought. It seems so counterintuitive to a healthy relationship - and I’ve yet to see one truly healthy relationship that does operate under this ideology. I’m sure they exist, but I haven’t seen it yet.
All the while, I understand that this is my opinion and has literally no bearing or any measure of importance for you or anyone else. To each their own.

I am not supporting any form of Mickey Mouse investment advice whatsoever. But... if someone invests anything they can’t afford to lose that’s purely on them.
If you’re gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough.

Only the profit.

Where are you getting the ATH from? I’m seeing that on a couple crypto sites, but on every chart I can find the highest it shows is $0.0019. And it says the ATH was 01-20-2018, but the charts only go back to September, 2018. Maybe this is a rookie question, but I’m confused? I’m not confused about the price variance, I’m confused about the timeline difference. And I’d like to confirm that ATH somehow.

I certainly am not doing so. I think we’re misunderstanding each other a bit is all, my friend. I agree with you, we’re just saying things a bit different.

This is definitely a good look for the community...
God damn it.

I think you’re severely overestimating the level of awareness the general public had during the last bull run. Yes it was in the news, yes people knew... but that’s it. Most people absolutely were not investing. People see news headlines all the time - but 90% of people don’t know the details. The entirety of the US knows we’ve got soldiers in the Middle East and have for quite a while, but relatively few people could give you any truly comprehensive answer as to why we’re even there. Normal folks still know nothing of crypto. I know several people who know what crypto is - but they still don’t see the big picture. While this is all speculation, I think there are still very few folks who really see all of this for what it’s worth. The tide is seemingly just now (year and a half after the bull run) turning from “some fad/scam/stupid internet thing” to “hmm, maybe there’s actually something here” in regards to an overall consensus. And that still means nothing in regards to your average person having any idea whatsoever how this all actually works.
And I’m a rookie. A full fledged fucking rookie, far from an expert. Imagine what the people who’ve dedicated their lives to this know that I haven’t even fathomed yet? This space is still setting it’s foundation, but I don’t think that means we can’t refer to some as “experts” in crypto if you will - and I ain’t it.

I believe the last daily candle like this was in December of 2017 as the previous poster stated.

This comment shouldn’t be downvoted. The decision to ignore and not learn about this new asset class is no doubt a poor decision that most people are making. But you’re right - the comment you posted this in response to is beyond arrogant. And traditional investments are not, and never will be, obsolete. This community needs to stop acting like that isn’t a fact.
Acting like an asshole and then saying it’s justified because of the other persons actions, no matter how poor the actions, only means you’re not nearly as wise, smart, or grown as you portray yourself. Time to re-evaluate.
