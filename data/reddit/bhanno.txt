Another MAJOR, INEXCUSABLE fail by Blockchain.info. I've never seen one Bitcoin company short of MtGox fail so consistently despite having so much of a head start and bottomless resources. That they're running BitcoinJ makes it all the more likely for their stakeholders to be onboard for Hearn's XT megablocks.






Seriously, you're connecting directly to a website that isn't even using a full node as a backend. At one point they were calling randomnumbers.org in place of a proper RNG. This is a fail on so many levels, it's practically inception.
