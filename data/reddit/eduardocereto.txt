He created one of the most popular shitcoins around.

My point is that the quote is dumb. When people say something is unregulated it doesn't mean it's good or bad, just that the government didn't put any rules in place to protect people. You can say it's better this way, but you can't say it's regulated by an algorithm. It makes no sense, the algorithm won't protect you if the price tanks tomorrow due to a new ICO scam or because your favorite stable coin turns out to have no backing.

Cocaine prices are not unregulated. They are regulated by market forces and not corrupted governments

I didn't think it would. Surprisingly the same article posted to r/CryptoCurrency is actually getting some traction.

Allow me to offer a counter argument. Try to keep an open mind. I think we are all handling this the wrong way. 
The response from OP and all comments here in this thread seem to attack the author instead of attacking his arguments. Even OP long response revolves around ultrage someone could ever write something bad about crypto and question the author knowledge or capability. Guess what? Even someone with less knowledge than you can have valid arguments. Attacking the person instead of the arguments only make you sound dumb and just impedes a conversation we should be having.
His main point is that criminals are mining Bitcoin and that is true, he also says that if you use crypto you are being accessory to the crime... Which you can also make an argument for. Whether it's through stealing processing power through, hacking or even paying for your own processing to finance illegal activities through Bitcoin gains, this is a problem that hurts crypto future. 
Crypto is associated with crime but the mining is just a small part of it. 
I don't think setting up permissioned chains is a solution. Criminals can still buy coins with ilicit money and profit from deflation or market gains, they just miss on the mining fees and reward. Not because databases are not scalable, that's moronic. It's easy to scale databases these days just setup spanner on Google cloud in 10 minutes you have infinitely scalable DB.
I believe there might be a third option. Maybe keep the system decentralized but keep wallet generation centralized so you can know who owns coins.
We can keep shitting on Forbes and the author, that's easy and fun. Or we can talk about ways to avoid criminals profiting from mining or laundering money. And then maybe we land somewhere better.

Don't worry, you can get in now before the next crash round. We still have a long way to go before we reach zero. Hop on the train to hell with all of us.

I'm not trying to sell you my solution. I'm trying to convince you there's a problem.

Just shouting FUD doesn't invalidate the argument. Your comment is exactly what is wrong with this community

Not with the current technology... But it would be easy to require all wallets to be signed by a central entity, reject the transaction otherwise.

Criminals use cash, but there are mechanisms in place to avoid use of cash for illegal activities. Bank accounts are registered, you need to report source of money when moving large quantities, government can see transaction information and know who owns each account.
Of course people still try to use cash for illegal activities, and sometimes try succeed by bending or breaking the rules. Now compare that with crypto. There's not a single mechanism in place to avoid illegal activities. In fact it seems the design of most coins is so that we make it easier for criminals to profit and launder money.
Maybe they could still launder money elsewhere, but we're making it easy to do it here. We need to have mechanisms in place as well to avoid it not make it easier.

I appreciate your passion. I want crypto to succeed, but I think the current version is not it yet. The space has to mature, my agenda is that we use this community for civil discussion. This feels more like an echo chamber than a discussion forum. It lacks diversity of ideas.
