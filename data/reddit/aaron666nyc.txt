Well congratulations, you've finally responded to something I said with context. First off, I do appreciate it, I feel less like I'm talking to a wall or a parrot that just repeats things regardless of whether or not they relate to anything I'm saying. You're not miles ahead of me tho because you are equating Universal Healthcare to being a form of government. America is not a socialist OR capitalist government. And having access to healthcare still would not mean that the people own portions of every American company. You're maybe miles away from where I am because you don't even seem to know what a form of government is vs an economic policy vs having basic human rights is.

Access to healthcare is a basic human right. Life (keyword), Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness (Also has keyword implications).  Paying huge inflated sums to an insurance company that in turn doesn't cover hardly anything is theft, Einstein. What goes on up there in that head of yours? Not much I take it.  What else do you consider FORCE and THEFT? Public Education? That get you big mad, thinking about all them teachers teachin? What else gets you all riled up, fire departments? Force and Theft Firefighters got you....HEATED?

Here's the thing with you brainwashed clowns. I never said shit about Obama or Obamacare, it's a talking point that you have assumed. Obamacare was engineered to fail by GOP congress members that wanted to ensure that insurance companies profits would remain robust and that it would have things built into it to force it to go belly up after a few years.  But let's not even be so divisive about Left or Right, because frankly Nancy Pelosi is largely paid by medical industry and as long as we have congress members -particularly, high ranking ones- that are funded by industry, we will never be a nation that puts the interest of the people first. People aren't stopping Donald Trump from taking on the Opioid Crisis by calling him racist.  In what backwards ass world are those two things correlated? You could call me racist right now, it wouldnt stop me from doing anything in my day to day. Those two are unrelated. But apart from that, telling someone who was BORN IN AMERICA to go back to their country, based on ethnicity and not even birthplace, is literally racist. That is a racist comment. I am not sure how one could be more textbook racist without using an actual slur. If anything, Trump is making outrageous "shocking" statements like this to keep the media circus turning while he and his rich crony friends rob the country blind. For instance, he drops a bomb about Chinese tariffs, stocks plummet, an excellent time to buy up stocks, a month or 2 later, meet with President Xi Jinping, mutually declare to end tariff wars, stocks sky rocket, an excellent time to sell off stocks and make an absolute KILLING on the margins. A month later, changes his mind, tariffs afterall, stock prices plummet, Harley Davidson announces they are leaving, Apple says they're relocating their manufacturing, 2 months later, changes his mind, stocks skyrocket, excellent time to sell, make an ABSOLUTE KILLING on the margins, throw in a massive tax break for the ultra wealthy despite running a compounding deficit, wealthy make huge gains, Amazon pays -1% tax rate and receive $129,000,000 from the government after making $11,200,000,000 last year, they are one of the 60 largest companies in America that paid zero taxes last year, wash, rinse, repeat.  You are a god damn fool.  And you also forgot to downvote my last comment

Authoritarianism does, yes.  I am not a fan of strict marxist socialism personally and actually if we're gonna go toe to toe on economic structures ruining lives and leading to oppression, I would like to present Capitalism which has brought us slavery, widespread homelessness, private prisons that incentivize mass incarceration and has led to the largest prison population on the planet both in general and per capita, monopolization, endless warfare, but back to your argument why my uncle shouldn't be seen for his broken knee...��

Unfortunately, part of this country's corruption and bought out politicians that sell our lives and health away (def by force and theft, no but for real) to private interests so they can maximize profits and gains (a recent proven example of this is the opioid crisis at large) is that the result of a defunded public health system means less and less access to mental health care.  I wish you the best.  Demons and witches aren't real btw. Hope u find help

WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THIS?  THIS IS KIND OF LIKE ONE OF THOSE EARLY 90s FILMS WHERE THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING AND ROOTING FOR YOU
@_date: 2019-07-29 04:31:18
Of course not because you are not a person who is interested in actually seeing other viewpoints. You have one fixed viewpoint and it's to follow your demagogues every command. Other viewpoints: bad. Reading, learning, information: Bad. You do as you're told.
@_date: 2019-07-28 01:24:08
Again, not actually saying anything relevant. yawn, sure.

The "Be Careful with those my beloved US people!" was a tell.  I used to live with, throw huge events with and toured with lots of people from Caracas, still keep in touch with them.  At anyrate, not one single Venezuelaño I've ever met warned me about socialism because of having healthcare (They DID however all warn me about the corruption within their government under Hugo Chavez, and the extreme dangers of isolationism)!  LOL @ whatever prick made this entire thing up.  I hope that person chokes on farts and that's how they eventually die is something SO UNPLEASANT to smell that it is the last thing they experience

Literally never once did I "Complain" about America, but it's okay, you are brainwashed to repeat a pre-set fabrication of bullshit that you thoughtlessly spew without question or context.  This conversation was over before it began because you literally addressed nothing that I mentioned.  btw "Western Civilization" largely refers to Australia and Europe (although does of course include most of North America), a lot of which you would probably consider "Socialist".  Scandinavia, France, England, Germany, Australia all have largely "Socialist" policies.  I'm too exhausted to have this conversation tho with someone that doesn't listen.  I can tell you aren't here for any type of "political discourse" you just wanna shake your dick around, it's really boring and people like you are extremely dull

Wait, sorry I've been laughing at how dumb you are, I tried to walk away but sorry, I can't, lol what are you talking about "by force" YOU are the one who came in this comment section a month later.  What TF would you call the military industrial complex!? Do you know what an *INDUSTRY* is?  It's commercial privately owned companies that own weapons manufacturers who buy out politicians to convince the public that we must FORCE (there's that word!) democracy on people!  Here is a list of countries the US has FORCED (ugh, that WORD again!) itself onto.  It's more countries than women that Donald Trump has FORCED (omg deja vu!) himself onto, so I will let you read...uhhhh, if that's a thing you even do?  I donno, I doubt it, but here it is anyways

Advertising is not free. Someone somewhere paid for that. Not arguing that "Bitcoin is the Future" I'm just literally wondering who paid money to put money symbols on something
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:18:43
Thats a really dumb way to spend the profits

If it's 2005 I think they mean Invent* Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:24:34
Since Bitcoin isnt a company with a marketing dept, who pays for this kind of thing and why? Whales trying to boost adoption? I always wonder this

Payroll is an intricate process intertwined with fiat banking. If your bank dealt in sandwiches this comparison would make lots of sense
