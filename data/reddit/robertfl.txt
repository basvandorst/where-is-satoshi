Shift VISA.
It's linked to a coinbase wallet.  It debits in bitcoin, no cost to you. ATM withdrawal is $3 I believe. (in the US).

I've occasionally been asked to provide an ID, but I couldn't understand why. I have 2 verified bank accounts linked, and a VISA card.  I have no desire to buy/sell in any volume.  How much verification do you need?  I've never had a problem with a suspended account - am I ok, or is the ID thing more of a concern for big traders? My main use for Bitcoin is to occasionally buy bitcoins, and to use my Shift Visa Debit card.

I realize, and they address that on their site.  Maybe you didn't have enough coin in your wallet to cover their hold amount.
The thing is, it allows paying with bitcoin to those that don't accept it.
That makes it a much more legit currency now. (I'm mean, exchangeable commodity - cuz, only the guberment can make currency).

I just applied for a Shift VISA Debit.
It ties to your coinbase wallet, and you can make ATM withdrawals on it.
It's not available in all states. It finally became available to me in Tennessee.  I'm looking forward to using it.  Hopefully this week or next.
Nice thing about this card is it isn't like a prepaid VISA you can top off with bitcoin (which is just an exchange to fiat). It actually pulls from your bitcoin wallet as you use it.
I'm hoping this furthers my transition to bitcoin.  Just need a bitcoin billpay service.  Dwolla doesn't offer the service anymore, too many guberment regulations in the US.  It'll happen.  Until then, any businesses that'll accept debit card auto-pay (ATT, Utilities, etc), I'll just point them to the Shift card.
I don't work for Shift, I've just been watching them for about a year now waiting for the card to become available to me. I've looked at other bitcoin debit card and they all seemed to fall short. XAPO had promise, but they cant ship cards to the US.
If you live in the US, Vote Libertarian Gary Johnson for President - he supports bitcoin. His campaign accepts bitcoin.

The other thing is, most people do not realize they already trade in digital currencies. How many people transact in cash today?  It's always debit, credit card, or Bank transfer.
In that sense Bitcoin is no different. What people get hung up on is, they can't cash it out. People have a sense of comfort knowing they can stuff something fungible/tangible under their mattress - whether they every would or not.
They other thing is, "what do you do with it - you can't spend it" - here you have to show them where all they can spend it.  Overstock is a great one - everyone knows that.
As for me, I donated to Rand Paul's Campaign with bitcoin - let's see Hillary or Bernie take Bitcoin:-)

Same here. Give them a 25 cent tour. If they're interested, send them youtube links and such.  Those that just think it's a scam, don't waste your time.  They're pessimist, feel everything is rigged and there's no other options than what we have right now.
They think diversifying means having mixed stocks, not mixed currencies.
A friend of mine, feels it's a scam,and everything is rigged, yet, he's invested in mutual funds. Even though I've shown him how 1)I've made bitcoin from BtcJam, 2) I've doubled my bitcoin value just in the past year, 3) I've used those gains to purchase products (including gold and silver).

I had to go through the same thing.
Its a requirement now for banks (KYC - Know your customer) and to prevent money laundering.
Go through it, get verified. If you can, keep a credit card with them so you can make instant purchases in the future.
I then went to  to hold them (formerly bitReserve) - but, they can't service me in Tennessee so I had to stop using them - to bad, I liked being able to move btc to silver, gold or dollars instantly.
I keep a stash at    paying 2.18% interest.
I use CoinBase only to buy bitcoins with cash, and if I want to sell them for cash back to my checking account.
I wouldn't be in a hurry to buy bitcoin right now - I think they're sitting at a high. Wait until they drop a bit. In the mean time, get your buying account set up.
@_date: 2015-05-18 15:04:15
I also found this: 
Your Privacy is Assured! (No Document needed)
We strongly focus on customer privacy
Cardholder's name does not appear on debit card.
No Documents needed to Get this card (fully anonymous)
I've heard there are restrictions on anonymous cards. Might not work on some websites, or some merchants might not accept a card without a cardholder name.
I only read one complaint. And the other sites that report them as a scam refer only to that one complaint.

I've made some gains on BTCJam, but I'd like to up it. I think the automation of making many more micro-micro-loans would work well.

But is the card working for you? Are you having any problems outside of that verification?
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:43:58
The problem is, ApplePay, Visa, Bitcoin is all electronic. It doesn't matter. they all move numbers, however, with Bitcoin, I have to get a debit card, send bitcoin to it, which is converted to dollars, with a high fee. What is the gain?? Using bitcoin?
If I had a true bitcoin debit card, that was attached to a bitcoin wallet, then that would be great. I don't care what they exchange it for in real time, so long as it's bitcoin to me.
When that happens, the ApplePay can support it -because it's just another Visa card to it.
Also, get a real bitcoin branded debit card so that when you whip-it-out the merchant sees "bitcoin" and they might start to think about saving transaction fees by providing direct support for it.  Until then, I can shop at Overstock, and send donations to the Libertarians.
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:54:42
That was an interesting read.
I understand the AML and KYC, but I wonder, is that really a big enough concern to put everyone's financial transactions under potential scrutiny?
If the gov't produces their own crypto, it would defeat much of the purpose of Bitcoin.
I don't know how the gov't provides credibility to bitcoin without distroying or sending it underground.
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:36:12
A stable price seems to be the "bounce back" condition.
Who would use it if the price just jumped all over the place constantly.  Merchants wouldn't - geez, they would sell something at $10 equiv of bitcoin, and by the time the actually got the US$ for it, it might drop to $5.
Opposite for a customer.
Stable is what's important.

They're legit, you just have to watch the borrowers, but that's the way it goes. learning curve.
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:41:38
I'd like to see more information on this as well.  I'm not finding a good side-by-side comparison to just a reloadable debit card.  I keep hearing, this is the first fully bitcoin debit card, which sounds to me as though its more then just funding a debit card with fiat using bitcoin. Then again, they seemed to say, the debit is simply funded with fiat. If it were a debit card tied to a bitcoin wallet that it drew from as needed, then it would be 100% bitcoin. 
I'm not seeing why I'd want this over a plain vanilla debit card. It has the same limit restriction as a debit card ($2500/yr $7500 lifetime) and it's only valid for 3 years. I haven't read what exactly happens to unspent funds after 3 years - is it use it or lose it, I know you can't cash it out.
As for the interest rate. That could be legit. A scam or Ponzi would prevent you from withdrawing your money once invested. This is just a wallet. As interest came in, you could send it right out to another wallet.
The only upside I see, right now, is convenience.  I can easily, cheaply reload the card, and I earn interest, and maybe the daily transaction fees are cheaper.  As I said, no side-by-side.
My main concern is, providing ID to an overseas entity.  I understand their claim it's for money laundering concerns and required by international law.  Then again, this is an anonymous card, so it's already restricted by it's maximum yearly use.
Which gets to the most important aspect of wanting this, anonymous. If that card is tied to me, then spending bitcoin is no different then using a credit card (which would be cheaper).
A Bitcoin debit card is about spending bitcoin as if it were cash.
Maybe that's the world we live in now. Maybe we can only get semi-anonymous.

Turn your arrogance down a bit.
I'm not talking about a prepaid VISA - I agree, it's crap.
"Shift" has a debit card that deducts directly from a bitcoin wallet.
Right now, they cannot ship the card to Tennessee because of State laws. I've been told, that they might be able to next month. That's huge.
Now I can deal with bitcoins even if a Merchant doesn't want to.
I know there is bill paying services, I've looked into them - they can't service the US...yet. 
We can't get direct deposit of paychecks here in the states...YET.
However, I've looked at your bill pay services and they charge a 2%+ service charge. It's dumb you would pay that.  If I can pay my bills with a debit card, that doesn't charge fees, above the transaction fee, that would be smarter.
The US has been slow to fully allow Bitcoin.  Great, Europe has been faster to adopt bitcoin.  Half the State are in various stages of acceptance, and some States barely allow it all.

IS it really a bitcoin debit?
It's really just a prepaid visa.  It has a $160/day cash withdrawal limit, and a $3500 yearly transaction limit. You can have multiple cards.  I want Amazon to accept a public key transfer.  That is truly anonymous.  A visa debit still has a ledger that can be searched.  Close.  It certainly makes using Bitcoin easier.

I use BC for my primary wallet, and exchange.  Mainly because of their established history.
Bitcoin is still a speculative thing.  Trust is everything.
Not saying there isn't other sites that are trustworthy, but if someone is new to bitcoin, Coinbase is trusted throughout the community.
Further, Coinbase is the only site I'm verified with (and Uphold).  It saves me from having to spread my personal information out to numerous bitcoin exchanges. All the others are anonymous.

They assume "terrorist" are doing electronic bank transfers.
If I take $3000 out of my bank account, and give that cash to someone, they can't trace that transaction.
Further, they make it sound like it's not possible to fund illegal activities with US dollars.  That's how it's being down now. I'm pretty sure and involvement with BTC's is pretty miniscule in comparison
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:25:54
The easy answer is, the government has no right to know where you get your income, or where you spend it. That is the problem, not proving the source of income.
So, where should the gov't their revenue from?  Energy. At some point, everyone consumes/buys energy (gas, electricity).  or food, unless you grow your own, or property tax.  If you're solar, and grow your own food your taxes should be pretty minimal.  That would be transparent.  The gov't couldn't hide behind shady, entangled tax code.

That isn't practical/possible for everyone yet. It takes time.
I'm waiting for Shift to offer their debit card in Tennessee.  Once that happens, I'll be able to move forward with more implementation of BTC. Not every state is allowing Bitcoin transactions and services.
Until then, I still need an exchange...that I'm comfortable with.
With the Shift Debit, I'll be able to transact direct from a bitcoin wallet with merchants that don't accept bitcoin.  That's better than a prepaid VISA that you load with fiat using bitcoin.
FWIW, I donated to Rand Paul, and now Gary Johnson with Bitcoins.
It takes time, that's no reason to call be sheep that are still transitioning.
If my employer pays me in Bitcoin, he'll have to go to an exchange, wouldn't he?  If I only transacted with merchants that accepted Bitcoin, I'd starve.  Publix, Walmart, Kroger, Whole Foods doesn't accept Bitcoin.

If merchants start seeing a lot of currency held in bitcoins they'll likely want to adopted btc in their stores.  A lot of saved btc's means there are people looking for a place to spend them.

They could make it very difficult to acquire.  They could prevent banks from allowing people to buy bitcoin through an exchange via bank draft.  Which would only leave direct cash purchase, and mining as the only way to acquire bitcoin.  If they further do away with cash, then mining or trade (gold/silver) would be the only way.
That is the justification for mining even if it is expensive.

That's ok, but the majority of money is moved in bill paying.
Coinbase might not know your shopping preferences, but Amazon would and always will regardless of how you pay them.
My concern is I don't want the government to be able to put a name to that wallet.  If I only use Coinbase (or the like) for bill pay sort of items, that's fine. All other P2P transactions, I always have the alternate wallet option.  Keep the IRS from ID'ing our onramp - should be out focus.

anonymity.  You can't be anonymous if you're paying bills - regardless of the currency, right?  If you can't use bitcoin to pay bills, what good is it?  A good, inexpensive bitcoin billpay service would drive bitcoin acceptance faster.

Well, I have a Conventional Bank acct, and a credit union account.  Not for his reasons, but because the CU's pay a higher interest rate, and I get a "dividend" yearly for being an "investor" in them.  I still keep my FDIC bank acct because I have a more local branch for depositing checks and such, plus it gives me access to two ATM accounts should the Fed's ever limit ATM cash withdrawals/account.
I haven't ruled out moving my FDIC acct to the Credit Union - but moving banks accounts is a huge hassle - easier to just spread it out between the two.

I've never had a problem with Coinbase.  The only problem I've had is with instant purchase. They test your backup CreditC on file by doing a $1 charge and return.  My bank sees that as a potential fraud attempt and lock the card down until I clear it. The solution was, don't do instant buys.  Since I hold a coin balance with coinbase I don't need to do instant buys.
That's the only issue I've ever had.

I am verified with anyone that is an exchange, or bank - the on and off ramps of bitcoin.  After you get your coin, move it to another wallet. Anyone that I purely transact in bitcoin, I'm anonymous in the most part.
Cost of doing business with fiat.
You're going to run into this more and more once you go over certain limits.

I pay for coffee now with it.  I have a Shift VISA that is tied to a coinbase wallet. The fact the they are debiting btc and converting to dollars isn't my concern.  Unless, these merchants see that transacting in btc is cheaper for them.
It's the old color TV problem.  Stations wouldn't broadcast color because no one had a color TV, and no one would buy a color TV because no one was broadcasting color.  It takes time.  Shift is providing a means of bridging that gap. Others will follow.  I'm sure the next economic whack will help push it...it's coming.

I have a Trezor and Case.  Trezor requires a connection to a computer, Case uses GSM network.  Both have their pro's and cons. Trezor is good as a store of coin.  Case is good a usable wallet (if GSM is available) - Case can buy/sell coin and transact (send/recv) (has built in camera and display for 3d barcodes).
Depends upon your intended use.
My GSM is sketchy at home.  Out and about it's fine.
My only real complaint with Trezor is that you have to caring the USB pigtail with you, but it looks like the NextGen Trezor will have the USB connector integrated.
Security on both seems very good. Trezor because of the physical wire to use it, Case uses a finger print reader (built in) to authorize a send.  Case was finicky getting my print registered the first time, but it's worked well in use.  Transactions seem a little slow to submit but that's probably because of the GSM speed.
Once again, depends on your need. Are you looking for a safe place to keep coin, or something you can use for purchases, and receiving coin out-and-about.  Either is a safe store, as I'm sure Ledger or others like it are.  Case is more expensive, but it's an active wallet.
I tend to use my Trezor as a Bank Safe, and the Case Wallet as my Checking account - and my Coinbase account as my debit card (I have a Shift Visa that ties to it.)
FWIW, Case Wallet can tie to a GoCelery account that acts as an exchange, nice and simply to use from the Case Wallet, however, GoCelery recently upped their fees to 10% (from 3%) OUCH!  High price for buy/sell convenience.

Step 1) WAIT!  You wouldn't sell your BTC if it hit $3000, right?  BCH could go up in value for awhile.  HODL it and see and how this plays out.  It won't go to zero overnight.  If it does it's no loss to you.  If it goes in half, you're still ahead.  If it gets up near BTC, you might make a tidy sum.
It's sitting at $698 now.  If you sold it yesterday, it would have been $200 - that would have been a mistake to sell then.  If BCH is increasing in value faster than BTC, hodl it, and wait for it to settle down into something stable - then sell it.
Have your trigger finger at the ready to hit the sell button.

How much are you buying?  
At around $11K/yr cash withdrawal, banks have to report that to the IRS.  If those xfers are considered cash withdrawal you may have the same problem regardless of where you bank.

Shift VISA.  It ties to your coinbase wallet and draws from it.  however you want to acquire bitcoin, just move them to coinbase and use the shift visa like any other visa debit card.
No fees to use the visa, and you can pull cash from an ATM (typical ATM fee applies)
Cards $10, deducted from the bitcoin wallet when you apply. It's not available in all States in US yet, so you'll have to check their list.

Cryptos price usually drops on a Friday.  It picks up again on the weekend.  Probably due to investors not wanting to hodl over the weekend, and hodlr's buying the dip - after a Friday payday.

Don't.  it might actually climb.  It could even match BTC.  If it goes to zero, so what?  1. it's technically "found" money (lets say "value" instead), 2. if it does go to zero, then it's probably because the value moved back to BTC. 
The opposite could happen, BCH could surpass BTC because the value of BTC moved to it.  I don't think anyone knows at this point - it's too soon.  What we can say, is that "value", whichever way it moves, will stay in the crypto-sphere.  I wouldn't consider moving it until next year after we see what/if SW2x does or doesn't.  do the same thing if SW2x causes a fork - sit and wait to see what happens.
No reason to be a BTC purest at this point.  I hodl other cryto's, why not hodl BCH as well?

But, 99% of the population doesn't understand the reason behind bitcoin, and they don't want to know.  That's something you, me, and the other redditors care about.
Does that matter?  Does it mean bitcoin becomes centralized?  The simple fact that you do not have to use those centralized payment hubs (if you're willing to pay for it) means bitcoin is still decentralized - you and I can still transact p2p.
Also, the "core" code is sound, LN doesn't preclude some other layer from being developed.  Always room for innovation.  Necessity is the mother of invention.

Nothing is going to happen.  BCH groupies think that once the BCH mining difficulty adjust that mining BCH will be more profitable than mining BTC and magically all the BTC miners will switch their mining power to BCH and BTC will fall.
Won't happen.  Some will, but not enough to matter. 
BCH value will have to significantly approach BTC before that would likely happen.  I'm not saying that can't happen, I just think it's unlikely.  I hope BCH does well. I think the BCH crowd are too focused on crushing BTC and looking to spike the ball in the end zone - that's sad.  That is why the hashing power won't move all that much, the adults control most of the mining power.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:05:53
Too soon to see a trend, but it is noteworthy that BTC goes down on Friday (as it usually does) and BCH goes up.  That says to me, traders (during the work week) aren't investing in BCH, individuals are.  Most people work during the week, and get paid on Friday.  when they're off on the weekend is when the buy BCH.
If so, I would guess, BCH "sells" happen during the work week.
Have to see if that trend continues.

If I didn't have "either" is a different case.  I would go BTC.
hodling BCH, right now, is no different than hodling LTC, ETH, NEM, or DASH.  All are speculation.  hodling only BTC is being a purest - "touch another coin and die" - right.  I wouldn't purchase BCH, but since I have it, I'll hodl it for awhile.
As for zero, I'll give you that, however, when "investing" that is always the case.   You put up money you're willing to lose.  BCH didn't cost you anything.  The argument is, "when to cut bait".  Fact is, you don't have to, you'll never have a loss on it.  You might lose out on gains by selling to soon or too late.   You only grow BTC by day-trading, and that requires timing as well. 
I have no desire to be a day trader.  I'm not looking for a quick buck.  I believe in BTC's concept and want it to achieve that goal, as such, I hodl and wait for more acceptance.

Don't blame the boomers.  SS was forced on society by the Progressives. The Gov't rigged the system to get people dependent upon it, then they failed to properly fund it. Then they expanded the distribution of SS to non-retiree's.  The problem is once the gov't giveth, they cant taketh away - which is the problem with Obamacare.  They knew it wouldn't work, but that didn't matter.  the goal was to get the masses dependent on it. Everyone changes their lives to adapt to that loss of income which now goes to pay another ponzi scheme and they can't afford to not have it.
I'm at the tail end of those boomers.  I can honestly say, I never expected I could rely on SS.  Can't blame the boomers, they were lied to and trusted the gov't too much - they allowed the gov't to grow unchecked.
You're wages aren't stagnant.  Any wage increases you would have gotten went to increased insurance cost, gov't tax and benefits (gotta share the love).
I use to get 5-8% wage increases. Now it's 2% because the increases in insurance ate the other 3-6%.
Thats not gonna change because no one has the stones to do what needs to be done "Don't touch muh SS!".  The only way it changes is when there is a complete economic collapse - Once it hits zero, they'll have no choice. The Fiat Ponzi scheme can't sustain itself much longer.
You're not the lazy one. What has happened is because of the gov't over reach, your ability to innovate and seek your own way has been significantly hampered, so fewer of your generation are able to succeed. 
Take back control of the currency, destroy the Central Bank and then Gov't will start responding to the people again.  
The fact that you're here, and you see the potential in bitcoin separates you from the masses. 
If I knew 30 years ago, what I know now - I would have focused much harder on getting off the grid.  Bitcoin makes that a much more viable option for you.  Don't get enslaved by the system.

Well, there is one major flaw, they're comparing "mining cost" to transaction cost.
To have an accurate comparison, lets look at the cost to mine gold, or the cost to produce dollars.

I've mentioned before, I have a Shift VISA, it deducts from my Coinbase wallet.  I'm not reloading a pre-paid visa with bitcoin and having converted to fiat ( I agree with you, that's not really using bitcoin).  It's converted at the time of use.  
Keep in mind, the US (and others) lags adoption.  Once merchants start to see people having access to bitcoin, and they learn how they can be saving on transaction fees, they'll look into adding bitcoin support.  A bitcoin branded debit card would help. That's advertising with every swipe.
It's a chicken and egg thing.  Merchants won't accept bitcoin if no one has it, no one will have it no one accepts it.  That Bitcoin debit does bridge a gap.

If you bought a bitcoin for $200, and held it for a year and it went to $400, then purchase a $200 item (.5 bitcoin) you technically got that item for half price.
The problem is the tax laws. simplify the tax laws such that we don't have capital gains tax, change bitcoin from a security to a currency status and I'm sure everyone would be happy.

Wait for China to announce they're going to clamp down on, or ban bitcoin. Buy.  In 2 days, China will reverse themselves and bitcoin will soar again.
Or, wait for BCH's claim of the Great Flippining. Buy. Wait 24 hours for the Great De-Flippining and BTC will soar again.
But seriously, I've found the best time to buy is Friday Late Afternoon - early Saturday East Coast time (-5 GMT??) this is usually when BTC is at its weekly low.
As for dips, you just gotta get a feel for it. Wait for a ridiculous rising trend, then wait for it to start dropping 10-15%, then buy.  It will bottom out, start rising again, then flatten off for a time (few days), then drop nearly to the previous low and that's the second dip to buy.  Look at the bitcoin historical price chart, you can see the trend.

The concern of NAND failures for repeated Writes is likely overblown - especially for a fullnode.
Since the blocks that are downloaded are never written to again, those are not going to fail from repeated writes.
The SSD cache will get hammered, but it isn't static memory and it wont suffer the from the excessive writes.
In regards to running a Fullnode, A HDD will never have an opportunity to spin-down, which is wear on the bearing and the head servo's.  Conversely, the constant spinning up and down isn't good either, for a HDD.
A "consumer" grade HDD has an expected life of about 3 years before it starts being a concern.  As a fullnode, constantly being accessed, even if only for small amounts of data, would likely show stress sooner.
I'll bet an SSD uses less power than a HDD as well.
I think a SSD is perfect for a fullnode. And if you really wanted to be way over the top...get a second SSD and mirror it :-)

Do not put a lot in it at first.
I use coinbase as my exchange, and never had a problem.
Setup an account, make a small buy to get the feel for it.  It's very different.  You need to understand and be comfortable with the security risk.  coinbase will control your wallet, but at least it's safe (in the most part).  get a phone wallet, or desktop wallet, set it up, understand your responsibility with it (back ups, recovery seeds, etc).  make some small transfers from coinbase to that wallet to see how it works.  practice using the recovery seed so you know what to expect should you ever need to use it.  By all means, view some 'how-to' youtube vids.
once you get a feel for it, if you're still excited about it, buy some more.
I got into bitcoin Fall of 2014 - after watching a lot of youtube vids.
I'm now running a full node, i love bitcoin.  I'm thinking about setting up an auto monthly buy.  In the past I just bought more coin when the price dipped and did pretty good hitting near the bottom each time.  bitcoin has had less volatility, comparatively, since then.
Bitcoin won't collapse over-night (it could, not likely) so, if you're watching it, and keeping up with the bitcoin news, you'll know if a time comes to get out, or move to another cryptocurrency.
In the end, don't risk more than you're willing to lose, and enjoy the ride.  You'll get more comfortable with it as you use/play with it.
I'm not an investor, or day trader, I actively use bitcoin, and hold it because I believe in it.
As for bitcoin dominance, that depends on how countries around the world try to control it, or not.  The US is way behind in policies - that could be a good thing, time will tell.

All through the month of June I kept emailing them directly, and on their Flatusbook page, "what were they going to do about it", and that I had every intention of closing the account if they didn't clarify it. They ignored it.  in fact, they'd delete my facebook post to them. Too bad, I was with paypal since the 90's.

I agree.  Both sides of this argument has turned into spit-balling and claims of "the other side sucks".  It was truly distracting when trying to get to the heart of the matter.  I understand why blocked the anti-segwit crowd, if they hadn't, this subreddit would have turned into just a btch board.  I believe they were right for doing that, although the 'optics' of it were bad.

Pin in not good enough.
Don't use Trezor for everyday bitcoin spending.  It's purpose is for cold-storage, a savings account.  Keep the bulk of your coin on it, and move portions of it to your everyday wallet.  If the bulk of your coin is your everyday/month use, then it's probably not a big concern. Just ask yourself, how whizzed off would you be if you phone got hacked and someone stole all the coin on your wallet?

Pin can be compromised. Face it, Pin is a minimal defense.  True, on a Trezor it's a lot harder, but still.  It should act like a Vault - you only open it occasionally.  Besides, I don't like whipping my dongle out in public - people stare and giggle.

Nail on the Head.  Bitcoin will not be fully adopted for awhile.  Hell, Greenbacks weren't over 100 years ago (and in some cases still aren't).
It will take time for people/industry to rethink how to "not have a bank/central clearing".  Until then, there will be an intermediate "bank".
In the past, you could drop $20 on the ground, and it was just gone and you were out $20.  Lose your bitcoin wallet and you lose everything in it.  That's unsettling to most.
And most people are not as tech savvy as you and I.  Hell, I tried to teach my cousin how to copy/paste with the mouse, and she nearly had a mental break down. OK, she's like 55 and never really used a computer before, but there are a lot of people like that.


I didn't say that, I said not properly safe guarding it.  Look how many people get attacked by email viruses but they still don't know when to NOT click on an attachment.
But your initial comment is dead-on, the population needs to be re-educated on money, banks, and bitcoin.  Bitcoin is still too young to be given that level of attention yet.  Next big economic hit will change that.

It's Magnr - they have the leading ad spot on Zeroblock.
CEO's are from respected fortune 500 businesses.
They're an exchange/investment - as such, it is open to risk.
Now, I could trade bitcoin myself and earn more - but I don't have time to be a day trader, besides, there are people that are better at it than I.
So, I'll sacrifice making 10% returns for a consistent, more secure, but lesser return and let someone else do the work.
It's no different than investing in a mutual fund, or stocks.
They aren't in control of all my coin - I have a wallet with them that I fund when I want to - so, it's not as if all my coin is at risk. No one puts all the funds in the stock market. Only invest what you're willing to lose.  But, at least it's making something if it's just going to sit there.
I was making good returns off BTCJam until they stopped allowing US lenders.
I have a
Wallet for working bitcoins.
Wallet for storing bitcoins.
Wallet for investing bitcoins.


I don't disagree with you, but if you have all you surplus coin in one spot, it's not working for you.  Investing always requires a level of trust, fiat or bitcoin.
With the value I've made off the increase in Bitcoin, over the years, the bitcoin I did "invest" is technically free money, so, I something did happen, it would be disappointing but not a real loss.  I do hear you when it comes to trusting.

You in the US?  Sometimes CC verification doesn't work with foreign addresses.
==Coinbase== {I didn't snip all of it}
Your limits
Buy limits 	Your buy limit is the amount you can buy across all enabled payment methods. 	
	When using a bank account, there are additional limits on how much you can buy or deposit to your USD wallet. 	
$2,000 weekly instant buy remaining max $2,000
$10,000 daily limit remaining max $10,000 
Coinbase may have separate limits for the different account funding sources listed below.
    Bank transfers (EFT, ACH, SEPA, Interac Online, Bank wire, xfers)
    Instant purchases via bank transfers, enabled by account history and a backup credit card (*********available to select users in the US only***********)
    Currency Wallet stored value (USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, etc)
    Instant buys (credit card/debit card, where available)
Maybe, I'm "select" :-)
in the case of bank transfer, the CC is just a back-up. As opposed to using it as an "instant Buy".

@_date: 2016-09-21 12:47:14
Let me tell you why I disagree with you, people keep money in banks now.  Very few keep cash under their mattress.
Add to that, the majority of the population isn't smart enough to keep their bitcoins safe, so they will opt for the security of a central repository to hold their funds.
And that really doesn't go against the principle of bitcoin.  The difference being, with cash, I need a bank to hold it, it's not practical to keep thousand of dollars on hand.  It's also not practical for me to pay bills by mailing cash (I trust the banks more than the post office) so you need the billpay ability of a bank (in today's society).
I think the point of the article is that banks will have to rethink what they do and the services they provide.  Billpay will become their main function.  As much as I could pay a vendor directly, no one wants to run all over the web paying everyone, and what if that vendor doesn't accept bitcoin?  A bank provides a one stop shop for that.
Banks could accept bitcoin, and pay anyone else in the currency of their choice.
Right now the US doesn't have a bitcoin billpay service.  If we did, I'd use bitcoin more than I do now. I'm not concerned about what they banks will do or offer - as long as I'm not forced to use them.
I'm more interested in the US eliminating road blocks to bitcoin adoption. The US seriously lags other countries in this area.

The only thing I would say there, is, "we have to see where it bottoms out at".
It bottoms out at the point where only the hodlr's are still in it.  That would tell you the relative size of those that believe in it, and those that are just looking for quick return on their investment.
If it bottoms at $3k that would probably show what value it has to real adopters.
If it bottoms out at $1K (or less) it will show this has all been hype by day traders and there is no real value in it.
That value will have a different meaning to each of us.
I look at it as how vulnerable is bitcoin.  That is, if it bottoms out at $3K it's very unlikely bitcoin will die overnight because that $3K represents the diehards.
Why is its overall value up? More people (diehards, and investors) coming on board.

Their an exchange/bank like Coinbase.  If you get capital gains off it you'll/they have to report it.
Are you investing/trading in bitcoin, or just using them?
I use coinbase as an on ramp.  I'll spend from it, but I move a lot of coin to other wallets.
If you never cash out bitcoin then the potential tax burden isn't really there.  However, "you" (at least in the US) are suppose to report your gains. That is, if you bought bitcoin at $200, and it went up to $600, and you bought $600 worth of products with that, that is a gain you are suppose to report.
If you want bitcoin to have "value" like any currency, you have to expect the government tax reporting to follow.
I would say, if your use of bitcoin always stays in bitcoin, that is you never cash it out, and anyone you deal with never cashes it out, then there will never be a finger print trail to follow/tax.  It would truly be trading. Of course, in the US, even trading is taxable.  Not sure how one taxes an equal trade. Technically, neither party had a "gain". 
I cut your grass in exchange for you cutting my grass, as a result, we owe the government - makes no sense.

Those transactions are still arriving in a sequence.  They don't all arrive at the same time.

I disagree that transaction ordering (time stamping) is the purpose of the miner, or has anything to do with being decentralized.
What purpose does a fullnode serve other than the keeper of the backup?
You have to admit, allowing cherry-picking is not serving the community, and an increase block size will have little effect on transaction through-put.

I haven't had a problem.  It's been sluggish, but with all that's been going on with bitcoin, that's to be expected.
I'm sure they never anticipated the sudden burst in demand.  No one could.  I'm sure they're also working very hard to increase capacity as quickly as possible.  Not sure what more they can do.

@_date: 2017-05-04 12:12:00
Backed up queue allows more transactions to be cherry picked.  Which is why larger blocks won't mean reduced fees.
Change the rules such that transactions must be handled FIFO - that would provide incentive for miners to process transactions faster and assure a 10min confirm cycle.  If transactions still backup after that, and the blocks are full - then increase the block size.

The Shift card isn't like a prepaid visa. If it were, I'd agree with you.

eBillPay/Checking is what's needed in the US. Once we get that, and it doesn't charge a huge fee (or any at all), with auto debit, I believe I can make the switch, provided the price of btc stabilizes - That is key.  I think it's getting there. This July should be a huge test.
Since I can't direct deposiot to coinbase or such, I'll keep my fiat, have the mortgage and car payment come from it, then buy fiat on coinbase. That should smooth out any bounces in btc price such that it doesn't hurt as much when it moves.
I've been using "magnr" for a savings account - 2.35% interest, better than my fiat bank.

As others have said, because you do not control the private key.  As such, you are at the mercy of that exchange.  They will get to decide what chain to support should the blockchain split.
If you don't have a lot of BTC, don't worry about it.  Coinbase, I'm sure, will chose the chain that is most likely to succeed. 
If you own the private key, you could end up with coin on both, and decide for yourself which way you want to go, move them all to one or the other, or keep both.
As a general rule, you don't keep your coin in the control of a third party.  Get a hardware wallet, or print paper wallets, and transfer your coin to it.  I keep some btc at Coinbase because I have a Shift Visa Debit tied to a wallet there, so I keep it funded.  I just don't keep a lot there.

If your store only holds 100 people, and 10000 try to cram into at once, you're going to have to deny some users of service.  Not like they can just expand the size of the store over night - that takes time and capital. 
I see it as a good sign - that shows demand.  True, I wanted to buy and had to retry a few times, but, it went through. And, Yes, I probably should be set up with another exchange, for just such emergencies.

"All in"??  As in, all your cash is bitcoin?  That seems foolish.  We still live in the real world where fiat is needed.
Forget Coinbase crashing, what if the gov't decrees tomorrow that crypto's are illegal and not allow you to convert them back to cash?
As much as I am all for divesting in the dollar, it is not practical to do it all, right now. This is still new tech.  Keep one foot in fiat, and the other in crypto.  Move more into crypto as it becomes more widely adopted.
If it goes down, so what, it doesn't go to zero - ride the wave.  Whats your average buy-in cost?  I've been buying BTC for over 2 years.  My average buy-in is under $1000/coin.  I'm not worried about price drops in bitcoin until it approaches that number. Even if it dropped to $2000, I'm still up compared to fiat.
If I can keep my average buy-in around 50% market price (yes, I'm way behind), I don't worry about fluctuations.  Once bitcoin resolves their scaling issue, I'll probably increase that to 75%.
Coinbase site can generate a report that will show you all your buys, how much you paid for it and amount of btc bought.  with a little maththat will give you your average buy in price.  Don't over expose yourself.

I don't consider it an investment.  I think of it as divesting from the dollar.
As bitcoin (or crypto's in general) get wider acceptance and use, I will move more fiat into it.
Right now, I'm comfortable with an average buy-in under 50%.  That is, of the coin I have, the average cost that I've purchased them at is under $1500 (&lt;50% of spot$).  Bitcoin could lose half it's value, and I'll not be at a loss.  Which is why I don't sweat price drops, it's a buying opportunity.
Once we get pass the scaling issue, I might move that average % up.
I'm not going to go all-in because the infrastructure just isn't there, yet, and we don't know what the gov't (and central banks) are going to do.
Ask yourself, do you buy bitcoin as an investment, or for the core principles of it?

I run 0.14.x on a Mac-Mini/Server with a Drobo DAS with 11Tb attached.  
The Node typically averages 256-300K.  I've seen spikes around 1M at times. Sometimes sustained.
It does seem to impact connectivity to my website (running on that server) but I'm not sure if that's because of the data load or the number of active connections.  Never bothered to really look. I have a 20mb internet connection, seems to keep up fine.  But, I am hoping for a GigaBit this summer.
You can configure bitcoin core (through its config file) to limit traffic and throughput- you might look into that.   Someone else here might know more on getting the settings configured. I've only glanced at it.
If you haven't already, go to:  and register your node to alert you if it should go down.

I'm still not convinced that UASF is wise.
I just want to confirm that should BIP148 activate, my FN is working with it and not against.
The problem UASF is a) it could break the stalemate-Great , b) have zero impact, c) torch bitcoin and any future attempts at "decentralization" by proving that the sheer volume of adopters will never reach consensus when it matters, and MOB rule will kill it.
That has to be weighed against the options of Allow Segwit to hopefully happen in November.  If that fails to happen, the success or torching by another UASF attempt won't matter than.
The potential to get this wrong is high.
The better tactic would be, wait until November, if that fails, everyone moves over to LiteCoin, then see if the miners move to SegWit.

I didn't say that.  Banks will have to change their business models.  Crypto's will force that to happen.  Many will resist.  Someone will embrace the opportunity.
Loans will not go away just because of bitcoin.
The banks will once again have real investors.  Banks will have to actually scrutinize loan applications.
Banks won't be simply deposit based checking accounts as they are now.
1) they will be exchanges, for as long as there is fiat to exchange.
2) they'll have investors so they can make loans.
3) they may provide CryptoSavings account that pay real interest.
4) they provide some kind of Bill Pay Service (whatever that may look like in a predominately crypto world.)
A smart bank would be looking to this and start transitioning to such a model.  The disappearance of Fiat doesn't have to be an absolute end to Banks.
Maybe a bank provides a custom wallet, and lightning network access with 1% bitcoin back rewards.
Banks would be important for Merchant Account reconciliation maybe (allow zero confirmation transaction processing).
Banks need to see this as an opportunity and not a threat.

If the community wasn't so evenly divided and stuck in a deadly-embrace this wouldn't have happened.
Keep in mind, BU's only reason why they didn't just split off was they want the BTC moniker.  That's not to say that bitcoin might not need a block size increase at some point, but with the time/energy spent arguing this, we could have had SW, and a block size increase by now as two separate updates.  That's why I could never understand BU's "our way or noway" approach to this. 
I disagree regarding being manipulated.  When things are evenly divided, this is what happens (look at Congress).  As the community gets larger, this will get harder - Consensus is a difficult thing to achieve. Either the project stalls and dies, or the percentage needed to achieve consensus is lowered.
SW2x is the first real test of the "decentralized" community governing itself. Right now we have the only path forward.  bitcoin sinks or swims by what happens now.  Let's do it, move on, and learn from it - and hope for the best.

At this point I'm tired of this bitching an whining and I want a solution.  The deadlock that's been going on is tiresome.
SW2x appears to be the path forward.  Bitcoin sinks or swims by it.  It surely would sink if we kept arguing over it.
It's time for the butt-hurt to shut up, let this happen and see what happens.  If it fails, you will be in your right to say, "told you so".
For decentralized anything to ever have a chance, we, the community, have to demonstrate we can reach consensus when it matters - and it matters now.

I have a problem with: 
"...The mortgage servicer and the credit card banks receive your dollars as planned. But like you, they are having to start transacting more business in cryptocurrency as the world marches toward the brave new world..."
One, If you're paying your loan, then the bank is receiving their payment as per the terms.  They're not left holding an IOU.  True, they might not be making new fiat loans, that doesn';t prevent them from making crypto-loans.
IF a bank should offer Crypto-Services it wouldn't negatively impact their fiat services (outside of them being wound down and retired).  They would likely be divesting from fiat (use interest payments on fiat to acquire crypto).  As fiat loans got paid off, that IOU would come off their books.  New loans would likely be made in crypto. Banks would just change their services away from Fiat.
The one's that will eat it, in the end, will be the FedResv, as all those Fiat loans are paid off, and no new fiat loans are made, they will be stuck with a bunch of paper no one wants.  They'll be selling it on eBay (for crypto) as Keepsake memorabilia of a dinosaur. 
The banks on the top of the fiat food chain will be hurt the most.  "Community" banks will probably thrive and be a valued service again.  Evolve or Die!  Banks will have to be businesses again, and not a government protected industry like its been for 100 years.
The problem is, if the gov't doesn't get on board.  If the IRS started accepting crypto to pay taxes, I think that would be the beginning of the end of the FedResv.
