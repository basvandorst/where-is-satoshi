Alas, the pool is no longer.

There are no miners and there is no blockchain in bitmessage. To send a message you need to solve a proof of work - that's about the only similarity. So the incentive to provide CPU cycles is if you don't your message doesn't get sent.

The pool generated a new block today. You can [see in the block]( how it divides the coins up amongst all the participants.

The defense against this is transaction fees. Doing 1 satoshi transactions will cost large fees.

A new cooperative mining server that can use standard 'getwork' based remote clients has started up.

ubitio.us has a really nice design. I think the fact that the uploaded files are only available for a limited time which gets extended when its downloaded could put people off.
@_date: 2010-12-13 12:37:12
File upload, get paid for download, services seem to be popular in the bitcoin world. There are at least three I know of. This one doesn't require registration and seems to have no time limit on the files. Nice!

[blockchain.info]( does a pretty good job.

At a guess, connect to thousands of nodes. Listen for transactions, noting the IP address of the first node you hear about that transaction from. Geolocate that IP.

The reason for the large number of namecoins moving around is [pool payments from bitparking]( when it closed.

One of the biggest problems with online poker is depositing and withdrawing money. That's the problem BTC solves in that area.

It is a fork of bitcoin with extra transactions for registering names, and associating a value with the name in the blockchain. Users mine coins just like bitcoin. These coins can be used as a currency. They can also be used to register names. There is DNS and other software that maps these names under the '.bit' TLD so they can be used from normal software.

Try the [Buy/Sell thread]( on the [NZ bitcoin exchange forum]( A fair number of trades get done there.

The 2+ million namecoin you saw moved is an inflated number. This was due to the pool paying out the final balances. The namecoin explorer adds up the 'change' address in the total. Of the 2,000 payments this gets included in the total multiple times.
@_date: 2011-10-07 00:11:23
Say the pool does 3 payments and has a balance of 1,000. The first payment of 100 will show as 100 and 900. The second payment as 100 and 800. The third payment as 100 and 700. The total on the explorer will be 2700. But the pool really only paid 300. The rest were the 'change' transactions - the remainder from the original address being paid back.

Have you tried [the NZ bitcoin exchange forum]( I can sell BTC to you for NZ bank transfer as can a number of people on that forum.

Gavin's address on that list is actually the faucet donation address. It's not his personal bitcoin address.

Satoshi's [post on preferring wikileaks not use bitcoin]( It was a while ago though when bitcoin wasn't well known. Too late to avoid publicity now.

I think the owner of the computer would notice if the CPU is using 100% constantly. Maybe the zombie could limit it to 10% or something.

You can turn this off with newer clients with the '-noirc' switch. It'll then use the seed nodes.

I don't see a point running a small pool when a number of large BTC pools will be using merged mining. That and I don't have the time to implement merged mining.

I may be wrong, but at one time the [EFF returned donations to the faucet]( which gave it a fairly big surplus.

Steve Thomas' tool doesn't decrypt the encryption. It brute forces the hash of the password in the confirmation email. If the user picks a weak password then it'll be recoverable. Given that the master key for all the encrypted data in a users account is encrypted with the password the user really needs to pick a strong one.

It doesn't have a blockchain or miners. The proof of work is done by the sender of a message.

Yes, from a security standpoint it's not optimal that the server stores the private key, even if it's encrypted. But it's really needed to enable the user to long in from any machine. An approach where the private key is stored locally in the browser would require a means to send it to other browsers when the user wants to use a different device.
SpiderOak is nice but their 'web access' method has the same flaw. Once you allow browsing of your files via a web client then SpiderOak keeps the private key in memory on the server for as long as the session is active. To their credit they advise customers about the security issues in this situation. 
@_date: 2013-02-18 21:25:48
Yes, if the site is sending any code (JavaScript, Java applet, Flash) to the client to do the decoding or private key handling then they can also send customized 'malware' code.
There are some ways to help improve trust like sending a hash of the content of the sent data that never changes so the client can confirm the hash. In practice no one would probably confirm it though.

So if you see mysterious funds in your mining wallet and don't know how it got there, this is why.

Hushmail responded to court orders to provide emails. [They sent comprised java applets to specific users]( to obtain their credentials and decrypt the data.
