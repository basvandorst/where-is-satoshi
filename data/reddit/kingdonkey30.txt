The internet and bitcoin will help its removal. Interesting to see blockchain tech and voting mentioned too. We're seeing a religous decline , the places its still strong are often the most impoverished and uneducated. Its a losing battle. No doubt it will remain in some form until it evaporates .

Yes it does provide guidance and purpose. But it was born out of being disconnected with the world and its secrets. We've seen how facebook can cause coups, its all snow balling togeather. The previoulsy silent masses, the faces of reason and fact, connected as never before. The icing on this,  the mathematical beauty of Bitcoin . Logic and fact are the way forward, the truth is far more powerful than a lie and far more beautiful.

When you say make sure your mob has full encryption what exactly is that, iv got a password on my mob, since gmail doesnt let me log out, and 2 factor on it and coinbase. Maybe a trezer? All this security is a headache.

The internet and bitcoin were all born from fact and reason.  I'm not saying they will be a religion,  merely that they will hasten the removal process. For some reason John Lennon just popped into my head.
