In short. No, LN is not censorable.
The question stemming from Roger and Charlie's debate from a joke where someone with a LN node named "Roger Ver" and refused to connect to any other node.
Payment channels are opened from one party, to another. Since nodes are incentivized to connect to alot of other nodes, it makes no sense that a node wouldn't be connected to any other nodes, except if that node wasn't broadcasting or the node wasn't funded to open channels in the first place.
So a node segregating itself is not censorship. That's what Charlie was pointing out, it was clearly a joke someone did, but Roger is spinning that to try and make false claims about the LN. 
LN enables you to anonymously connect to other nodes and make payments in a permissionless, censorship resistant manner.
Here the article gets its facts a little twisted on what the LN is...
"Lightning network is an implementation derived from the Segwitt protocol implemented in Bitcoin which was the reason that generate the fork between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash."
The LN isn't an implementation derived from SegWit. It's a separate 2nd layer protocol which SegWit did help make the LN work easier to implement on the Bitcoin protocol, but it wasn't necessary. For example, LN can work on BCH even though BCH doesn't have SegWit. The 2 are often linked, but it's not entirely true.

I think Bitcoin will eat them before the bears.

I mean, that's good to hear, but they didn't move fast enough. I've moved onto using Edge.app a long time ago.

This is a freaking brilliant idea! I might have to steal it. :)

This is by far the best wallet out there for security and usability. Great job!
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:07:31
Luckily, I don't use your wallet anymore, so this wasn't an issue.
Glad you fixed it though.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:42:30
Oh I see. 
Why not integrate with a more decentralized option like BitQuick? or Wall of Coins? These don't require user info.
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:07:34
Are these partners hosted exchanges?

Copay is very straight forward multi-sig.

The little crypto that could... indeed.

Silver is decentralized. Not as much as bitcoin though.

I would, but I've moved onto Edge, they had Segwit several months ago.

This is very disappointing. The 2 main 'selling' points merchants were willing to even use Bitpay to accept Bitcoin were the 0% transaction fees and the daily settlements. The "starter plan" does weekly settlements and charges 1% fee for doing 30+ transactions.
I suspect this will not a positive effect on the adoption of their service or of Bitcoin.
What's the next best Bitcoin processor?

1 year later.
"Yeah, nevermind about that."

BIP148 nodes will reject any blocks that don't signal SegWit... since we already know BCC doesn't support SegWit, miners mining on that chain would be disrupted by BIP148 nodes by rejecting BCC blocks causing that chain to be unusable. Price crashes, looses hashrate till it fades away to the abyss to from wence it came.

Welcome to the crypto community! 
There is little cause for concern with Aug 1st. The split will not effect your current hodlings of bitcoin, no matter where you store them, but it's always prudent that you own the private keys.
[Airbitz]( Breadwallet, and Mycelium are all good wallets where you have the private keys.
With the private keys, after the split, you will be able to import those keys into a wallet that supports the new token BCC and you will have the same balance of bitcoin that you had prior to the split. Good luck!
