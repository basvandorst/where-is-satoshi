I know you guys don't like to hear this. But remember that buffet is a conservative value investor. He looks for strong assets that the market has undervalued, and buys. But he is conservative and bitcoin is still wildly speculative. Not only are virtual currencies still questionable to take hold as a real financial instrument with long term potential, but bitcoin itself can be disrupted at any time due to any number of factors. People shave, people drink liquids, people need insurance... These are the things buffet goes after. He can't be reasonably certain that apple that is valued many times over earnings compared to other blue chips won't be radically devalued in a few years due to some disruptive technology. This more so for bitcoin. And it is fucking hard to recover a 90% loss when you're working long term on stable gains at just abov the street average.  You want your speculative instrument, that's great. But buffet is a more conservative investor.  He is also wildly successful, so I wouldn't immediately discount what he says without fully understanding why he is saying it.

Its a bitcoin joke, but not a very good one.  And probably funnier when you're drinking the kool-aid.

I would buy bitcoins from western union if I could convert through them. Although, I am not sure they'd be around long enough when I wanted to convert to something else.

I have thought about it.  I have some free time and might as well use up some frequent flier miles.   And plus, I haven't been to SF since I was 8 years old, and I would love to rent a car and drive around town and sight see.

Yeah I doubt the people who "fell for it" actually did.  I guess you now need collusion of two or three trolls to get published.
