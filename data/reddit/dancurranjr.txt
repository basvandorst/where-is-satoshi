Ok - cut, past, cut, paste, scratch head...
Finally figured out - when cutting the address from Trezor wallet it was adding a leading empty character (space) derp. derp. derp.
Thanks for the support!

So I thought that might be the case and created a LEGACY wallet on my Trezor - got the same error
"Tried 2 different addresses with a 3 prefix and a legacy address with a 1 prefix. "

It's an Excel spreadsheet - version 2 to the public, version 10+ to close friends.   Slow your roll on the "POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS" rhetoric - breathe.

Used the Segwit address too so that's not a problem.

I would like to nominate Ray Hutchings. 
In a nutshell, Ray fought in the Korean war, was wounded in combat, he earned the Silver Star, the Korean Service medal with 3 Bronze Stars, and several other medals, but refused the Purple Heart, as he said the wounds were part of the risks understood when he volunteered.
Ray never filed for his VA Benefits and is in very real danger of being evicted from his assisted living facility any day now. The VA finally submitted his benefits application August 8, as a Pentagon fire in 1974 destroyed, most Korean war records, so we had to reconstruct them. 
We have set up a website to help solicit donations-  
Full story is on this page:
I realize this is a long shot but thanks in advance to anyone who can help. 
I would be happy to answer any questions.

I don't understand why people are downvoting my post. I see the upvotes move around from 7-9 and then back down which means some people are upvoting, others downvoting. 
I created this spreadsheet, did the research, offered it for free, no strings attached in the spirit of the BitCoin  community at large - helping others out.
What am I missing? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:34:09
I stand corrected - wasn't fully awake yet ;)

True - and yes I did put a referral link, not hiding that or I would have used a URL shrinker.
My concern is that I am seeing all these people come out of the woodwork because of news coverage and as you know, they need to do a paper wallet or a fob. 
I literally spent 3 hours today with a 65+ neighbor who sold stocks, personal possessions, etc. to buy BTC and other coins. She was surprisingly knowledgable but had no concept of a paper wallet. It took me - a certified Naval Instructor - about an hour for her to get the concept of a paper wallet. 
I have been getting emails and phone calls for weeks now with friends and family asking about BTC becuase i have spoken about it in the past. 
My recommendation to them and to others  - Save a few hundred bucks (or whatever you are comfortable with) in your exchange account and USE IT TO BUY STUFF.
And get a Trezor (or two) to put the rest of your coins in. 
And then - I completely agree with you, set up a paper wallet.

make sure you don't have a leading or trailing space in the address if you are cut and pasting - that's what was getting me
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:14:02
Yes, it can - that's why we use Malwarebytes. Look, I truly appreciate caution and skepticism . . .but I'm not exactly hard to find online or in real life. Enjoy the spreadsheet if it's useful to you. v3 is in the works.

I understand cautiousness concerning crypto - I do. This is simply a gift to the community that has received very nice feedback and has more versions to come as it is refined.
Chillax Francis.

Just tried again - keep getting "Not a Valid Address" - WTF?
Tried: 114Fx6cfS46rGHt3VQqiE2AF1cZhAwehwa
And: 3BrqUsd4MR2A1n6c7Z9PxWZFr1aC1M3crv
Both on Trezor. One Modern (3) and One Legacy (1)
Not asking for a handout but if someone can try sending like $5 or whatever to the address - can you get it to go through?   I'll PayPal you back the money if it does- I have a PP balance so no fee.
Fucking frustrating! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:36:33
No, I keep them on a hard wallet - someone paid me through a coinbase address. "LOL" Ass.

I got an email saying my password had changed so I immediately tried to log in, got rejected, then reset the password and re-auth'd - you can kind of follow it in the timline
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:18:31
Check, Check and Checked. 
Guess I'll wait a while since the servers are possibly getting slammed again. 
Anyone else having issues?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:17:08
SUPER high fees at the ATMs - LocalBitcoins is better imho

Thanks for the clarification. Appreciated. Regardless of where the document is stored (Google Drive, One Drive, FTP, etc.) Excel is going to flag that there is a macro when you run the document. Mine doesn't use Macros - it uses a plugin that is embedded in the spreadsheet. If you are running Anti-Malware and Windows Security then you can breathe (fairly) easy. As we both know, nothing is certain or fool-proof, but for the average person that will keep you pretty safe. 
You are at higher risk surfing websites that you are downloading documents these days. uBlock, Privacy Badger and HTTPS everywhere are your browser add on friends.

I was having a hard time finding a simple formula to pull the prices in real-time. Read a few articles and then figured out how to do it for multiple cryptos using an excel add on. 
There are a few typos on the sheet I noticed when going back to my actual ledger spreadsheet this evening but the math works and the live updates work. 
I am open to suggestions for additions for a V2 somewhere in the future

It's a scam. If you click on the link there will be a clone of the CoinBase log in page. "Log in" and now they have your U/P - which is why you need to have 2 factor auth set up as well.
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:29:41
My wife got the exact same message the other night and she doesn't have a crypto account. I do. Told her "Click on it" on her phone and then realized what they were doing.
Account or not - make sure you have 2 Factor Authorization and never store coins on an exchange. Use Trezor or other device as a cold wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:16:07
Why don't I get this?
