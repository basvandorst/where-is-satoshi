Lol no. It's almost every comment ever made here. This reddit itself has just plummeted in quality. That doesn't mean bitcoin everywhere looks bad, the activity and influence it obviously has on the world is evident that is is important. It just seems that discussion forums about it are crap.

Why did you assume that I was laughing at this particular statement? Or that I am against or for your shitty currency analysis (ie: that I am either with or against your bitcoin plight) ? It was very clearly stated that the analysis in bitcoin fourms is utter shit. That's what I am laughing at. It's you.
Hey... I have an idea. Go take your angsty, strawman riddled debates and have them with someone in or I clearly don't give 2 shits or respect anything you have to say. That was made very clear in the first condescending post.

Low relative to what? What makes a single BTC worth $300? Just because some chart says so? If you don't understand the value of bitcoin, don't refer to this as an investment. Think of it more like gambling. And your odds may be better than the houses, or they may be FAR bellow your typical las vegas casino.

I think this really depends on the country and the decade. In some countries, the oligarchs are the only big businesses. That's my concern with btc taking off in periphery countries. The whole world is ran by these types of gate keepers. I think BTC is up against a lot. It *may* take a few iterations of new crypto currencies to iron out the kinks and to make it safe from being toppled.

Which in turns means bitcoin is killed if it ever becomes a threat the the visa/mastercard/banking cartel.
Sorry if that libality bothers anyone who has "invested" in BTC.

Yes, Russia might actually stop using MC/Visa. As well as NK and China. Big whoop. The rest of the world that is NATO or has strong ties with Nato allies (Japan/Thailand/SK/etc) will certainly continue to use MC/Visa.
If you think the "other countries" are some how more free (accepting of the freedom to use BTC) or less corrupt than America... you're in for a surprise. They're all shitty and deal in oligarchy excessively. Those that aren't get toppled by "freedom troops" and embargos (eg: ghadafi, chavez, castro)

GDP doesn't correlate to MC/Visa card purchases directly (aka one-to-one). It doesn't even correlate at all. Russia/China are semi-peripheral and peripheral countries: 
 MC/Visa are for middle class end users. Amex is for corporate employee purchases, but in general, corporations (GDP drivers) don't use plastic cards to move money around.
Now I see why ridicules this place so hard.
