Great. Once it's open for the masses and when binance does the same expect big money to flow in again

Cool, so all pre-verified users now can deposit /withdrawal fiat via wire transfer?

You will also have expert day traders, they don't care about a coins fundamentals nor the tech, just looking for a quick gain in a day before going out.
Those guys will have tight stop losses, which appear as panic selling on the books.
I'm not a fan of day/swing trading in a bear market, too risky. Prefer to hold good fundamental coins like ETH, ICX or VEN until market recovers.

Expert as in Twitter proclaimed ones?
It will reverse when the market consensus says so.

IMO more runs coming before the fork. We still have 10 days

Market cap = current price x # of coins in circulation.
It's a figure, doesn't necessarily mean there is that much cash invested in it already.

Make sure you don't hold any coins in your pocket while in the airport else the​ metal detector machine will beep.

Sounds like you first need to set an agreement with a coin exchange house. After all the ATM needs to connect to one of those to validate and process transactions / trades / fiat withdrawals
ATM model depends on what you plan to do on it:
Trading only: no need for a full ATM, a simple kiosk will do.
Fiat withdrawals &amp; deposit : get a full function machine capable of both, search for NCR 6634 ( through the wall model) or 6632 ( lobby freestanding model)
Btw I work for an ATM manufacturer :D

Isn't etoro an actual exchange to start with ?
They are a CFD, they make money when you lose. You don't own anything when you trade there. It's all virtual and they bet against you.
So I wouldn't even count them in the game.

Depends on the country you are in: generally speaking a full function machine will be around 45k usd. 
Add to that yearly hardware/SW maintenance (5-7k usd approx.)
Dont forget renting a spot to place the machine from a landlord will cost  as well.
Communication Line costs from a Telco.
Finally one time  integration costs to a BTC exchange house.

Etoro once published a 15 min ad on YouTube by someone claiming to be a random Joe who now makes 10k monthly on the platform.
This alone made me raise many questions on their operation. I'm much more content to deal with an exchange that doesnt care if I lose or win - making money on trades over a platform that bets against me to make money for themselves. That's just me though
