Bitfinex: Please reset your 2fa' 'You can't withdraw LTC.' [exchanges LTC for bitcoin to withdraw] 'You can't withdraw BTC because you recently changed your security settings.'......
 
Well I guess you guys are making money on trading fees locking people into the exchange like this. Well played, well played.

So why Roxcoin, it was released in a way that will cause huge market pumps and dumps. Can you explain the reasoning in a way that will make me (a crypto nerd and musician) comfortable with the way it was done? Because as it stands I don't want anything to do with it because I haven't seen a logical reason behind the unfair initial distribution.

Sorry for not responding, Im in the middle of a move. I'm a musician and I really think crypto could fix the music industry and bring justice to those who have been done wrong and had music stolen by corporate leeches. You should check out the cypherfunks, and tatiana coin and nice plumb, these people are trying to do it the right way. Ill keep in touch.

If you are more of a researcher, I would go with 'Political theory of open source blockchains'. Then observe each established blockchain project (Bitcoin as well as the others) and the political approach of each. It's fascinating and educational watching emergent political theories and open source political systems. 
If you are going for a project I would suggest coming to a 'Life is People' 'Session'. I'm working on this project with artists and musicians to use blockchain technology in a real world use case. This is an underdeveloped sector of Blockchain computer science and would be a great place to start a project. If you're interested to learn more, register for a Session to check it out:
