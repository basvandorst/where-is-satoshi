No, the biggest waste (or let's just say cost) is the immense amount of electricity it uses to mine and transact, which needs an underlying resource to create said electricity and the top candidates are coal, oil, natural gas or similar (sorry, wind and solar just do not cut it in real output.)
The math is quite simple.  There are many merits to crypto, but this isn't one of them.

So in other words my original comment:
\&gt;Vietnam is a single party run nation, so like China they banned Bitcoin as a payment instrument. 
Is correct, and you wrote all of that hissy fit for no reason other than to maybe say you can still have it as a novelty, like a keychain for example, is that about right?
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:04:00
What did you say about hissy fits again ��

See that's the problem with this mindset, you assume that people will want to and be ready to, en masse, do something illegal to make it work.  While simultaneously spouting how steady and legal the entire operation is, therefore it should be treated as legitimate.  
An ~$8,000 fine is more than enough to deter most people, that's why this coffee shop in this picture for example explicitly states (the small sign) "crypto exchanger" and not "Bitcoin accepted for all goods and services".

^ Yeah I'd like to know this too. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 03:07:16
I'm sorry but when someone writes 9 lines of text it's a sign of insecurity in the underlying.  Usually, you're different I guess, backbone man. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:41:00
Ok.  Proof?  Cause I posted an article out of several a simple Google search reveals and what I wrote was based on the information obtained from the articles.  Please, let me know what your sources are. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 03:23:45
20 seconds, typing that all up, researching (I suppose in this case it must be remembering right?) and linking the Greece article, instinctively knowing and typing up the legal status of crypto and then some.  I assume all without really caring, just off the top of your head right?
You should work as an analyst for a hedgefund why are you wasting your time here bro lol.

You're not really explaining anything but putting out a bunch of assumptions. 


Can you please explain why and how cryptocurrencies are more efficient?  In addition, couldn't existing systems and currencies adopt the blockchain tech (which is happening) and leave any and all alternate value systems?
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:31:22
That sounds like a buzz words argument from a crypto site, can you explain how it relates to what we're discussing here?  Financial institutions, debt instruments and all are widely traded electronically already in all currencies for debts public and private.  So how does your argument relate when discussing better allocation of natural resources taking into account what has already been established?

Oh shut the fuck up.  You know as well as I do that everywhere socialism/strive for communism has been done has ended in absolute disaster. Oh no but it wasn't "real communism" was it until it happens next time then you go back to it wasn't real communism. 
Either read a history book or be quiet. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:21:33
You're an idiot and discredited yourself by proving my point in your opening statement. 
Learn to argue. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 18:51:08
And you are obviously completely retarded if you think having the **word** socialist somewhere implies socialism I.e. a command economy (like Venezuela, the country in question.) If so either you're brainwashed yourself or an idiot whose best prospect is getting a job at a gas station for the rest of your life. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:59:41
So... the same article as yesterday then just worded differently?
@_date: 2018-06-02 00:42:38
Are you seriously trying to reason with these people?
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:32:10
No I don't do commodities, rather equity in securities.  When you decide to stop being a poor ideology fag come visit ��
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:59:10
Brilliant argument.
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:23:40


Please tell me you understand this. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:06:29
My god lol. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:49:09
I was expecting some hare brained response but a typical reactionary response without anything substantial is quite typical of you people too so I'll just leave [this]( here then.  
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:22:27
Now see these kinds of environments are where cryptocurrencies can thrive.  Stay realistic folks. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 18:02:18
Yes that's right, you people.  Unlike a lot of people who are too nice to call a spade a spade I recognize that I'm on team this society and you're on team trying to fuck this society.  I sure hope you're going through some sort of phase and the novelty of being revolutionary or different or whatever will wear off (goes without saying I certainly hope you aren't just malicious or something) but until then, or just generally, still: go fuck yourself. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:40:24
Postwar Britain was also capitalist.  You void your opportunity of using such in your examples of command economies.  Try again Trotsky, I'll wait. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 00:44:02
Yeah, cars aren't selling like they used to. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:55:29
Yes, but on the other hand this also means the area bitcoin inhabits is already inhabited. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:29:11
Then consider it a compliment!  But doesn't it speak volumes that it's in the realm of possibility someone would actually think that on this sub.

Without taking any sides I just want to point out that this is the most ignorant thing I've read today.

How much is that in Stanley Nickels? 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:41:12
Should have put them in Stanley Nickels and Alf pogs. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:33:01
That was their exact press release.  Fun fact.

Do you guys actually read the articles or just look at the headline and go "yeah this is good"?
