One is company. One is a currency. 
Am I missing something?

Just think if you only bought and never sold....

And VTC.

I mean, percentage-wise the market must really favor NEO, XEM and IOTA—just to name a few. There are plenty of competitive, climbing currencies. 
I don't think new, bandwagon investors with little tech knowledge represent the "market".

Buy ATH, Sell ATL.

Not necessarily. I feel like perception is skewed by price. 
If you invested $1,000 in BTC one month ago, you'd have roughly $2,000. That's an excellent return.
If you invested $1,000 in NEO one month ago? You'd have nearly $9,000. That's fucking outstanding!
If we're talking about "new investors", I don't think there's a clear winner. Also, take into account circulating supply, market-cap and age. I would say the leader is necessarily winning, in comparison.

They said the sell bitcoin, but they also have other merchandise.

I figured it was. I was just excited to see a physical representation of cryptos!

Top photo is our Hostel, which accepted Bitcoin.
Below is a photo of a sign at a gas station. I do not speak Slovenian, but I believe it is advertising payment through BTC. If anyone knows different feel free to correct me!

You won't regret it! Of all the cities I've visited in Europe, Vienna is quickly becoming a favorite.

Hodl and increase your hodlings. I will never sell down, but I'll sure as hell buy more when prices are down!

I'm having the same issue sending between exchanges, right now. The transaction is pending on the front-end and not showing on the recieving-end, with 0 confirmations. Horrible timing, as I was trying to buy the dip... 
I'm assuimng it's just BTC being the shitcoin that it is...
