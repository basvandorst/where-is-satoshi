Did you withdraw to Bank of America?

Heh nice one.


Please send me the link to a 2MB+ block. Otherwise just grow a pair and learn to read and investigate on your own instead of just believing everything people tell you


Yeah, the option of funneling/centralizing the network through LN and stealing miner fees is totally a better option... for Blockstream ;)

Yeah, I noticed. They kept making up excuses to make the Bitcoin.com wallet look bad. Even a mod had to come out and say that the wallet is safe. I don't know what this people win by dividing the community. smh

It's funny that you talk about decentralization when there's only 1 dev team (Bitcoin Core)  controlling Bitcoin. If they don't want to implement something then it doesn't get implemented. Period. Do you want more centralization that that? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:42:12
It doesn't matter which wallet is the default one. Even if Bitcoin Core was the default wallet, if there's more than 1 cryptocurrency in a multi-currency wallet then you must be able to know which one to use. Same thing applies to other wallets like Coinomi, Jaxx, Exodus and very soon with Coinbase.

Blockstream only allows the changes they agree with. That's why it's centralized. For example, since on chain scaling would be bad for the LN they don't agree with it and even if a majority of users and devs agree with even a small block size increase, they just don't allow that change. Therefore, centralization.
Fun fact: [Blockstream CEO]( used to agree with on chain scaling but changed his mind because he can get more $$ with a centralized LN

That wallet doesn't support SegWit
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:36:53
Post the list of the hundreds of people. Only a few have the total control of the code and commits. That's why it's centralized. If those few devs don't want to implement something then it doesn't get implemented. Period. It has been proven already.

Even newbies know how to read and distinguish colors.

Your friend is an idiot. The receiving addresses are the same. 
When you install the wallet the Bitcoin receiving address will be:
And the Bitcoin Cash receiving address will also be: 
These addresses are examples of course. But as you can see they're the same. So the funds are still in the wallet. Even if he gave away the Bitcoin Cash address to the sender thinking that it was Bitcoin, just tell him to tap Bitcoin (the yellow one) and the funds will be there available to use. If he uninstalled the wallet and didn't save the seed then that's his fault.

How are you gonna get Bitcoin Cash without knowing that it's Bitcoin Cash? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:59:07
So? If this wallet doesn't generate SegWit or Multisig addresses then you can't lose money with it. It only generates standard wallets (starting with 1) so doesn't matter if you provide a BCH or BTC receiving address, you still have the funds.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:05:46
How? It clearly says "Bitcoin Core" and "Bitcoin Cash". They even use different colors: Yellow and Green respectively. If you send the wrong coin you're either retarded or you just like to throw away money. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:21:39
You are the sock puppet and shill. Please post the list of the hundreds of people. Nice try. Only a few have the total control of the code and commits. That's why it's centralized. If those few devs don't want to implement something then it doesn't get implemented. Period. You're free to believe what you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:15:43
It's not fud. I did my research. My advice is: do your own research and don't be biased. Don't expect me to do it for you.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:36:08




Sadly you'll find out the hard way
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:48:52
Since this wallet doesn't generate SegWit addresses, your point is moot. You can't lose money with it. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:55:35
lol you keep making up stuff just to try to throw mud to this wallet. I haven't acknowledged anything because it's just not possible to lose funds by sending the wrong coin because the addresses are the same. Same private keys. 
You still haven't explained how would someone lose funds by sending to the "wrong" address. 
First of all, before sending Bitcoin Cash by "mistake" to a Bitcoin wallet you would need to buy it first before spending it. Guess what? If you're buying Bitcoin Cash then you already know they're different currencies. Therefore your point is moot. If you have Bitcoin Cash to send it's because you already know that they are two different coins. Or is this wallet giving away free money (Bitcoin Cash) when you install it?

Yeah, what's the point of having a constitution when these "so called judges" (got the Trump reference?) can overrule basic human and constitutional rights?

Try using their vault instead so you can use a custom fee.
