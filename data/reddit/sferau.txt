MASS ADOPTION IMMINENT!!!
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:57:48
Sorry buddy, it's all a scam. If you do take part, then SFYL I guess
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:51:26


And what's this sub right here?
@_date: 2019-08-01 11:34:17


When have you ever seen someone **use** Bitcoin? At least the scanners have some kind of benefit
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:51:51


"bUt BlOcKsTrEaM aNd AxA"
They say, on their deceptive sub and domain name controlled by Bitmain and Mr Ver... ironic

Then the paycheck goes up... shock, horror!
@_date: 2019-08-11 12:28:14


So what happens when the loan recipient defaults? And what happens when the facilitator shuts down (like BTCJam), and takes the rest of the money? What's your solution for that?
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:42:32


Try saying that in lol
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:11:38


*cough* BCH/BSV...
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:32:01


So, pay your taxes?
@_date: 2019-08-11 09:28:28
Worst idea ever. Have you heard of BTCJam? Bye bye money...
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:27:44


I realise that, but they claim it is - and there's plenty of confusion out there. So it essentially is creating more out of nothing.

Uuh, 2%???
@_date: 2019-12-13 12:49:07


Much less than a 10% fee...
@_date: 2019-09-30 16:34:24
No lol I prefer banks.
PS I got banned from so I ain't no bcash shill
@_date: 2019-09-30 10:44:20


So, uuh, just use a bank?
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:43:34
Uuh, doesn't this show one going down 1.3% and the other 14.25%?
@_date: 2019-09-17 08:34:53


The person who had the $200 stolen from their bank account got their money back. The person who had the $200 in Bitcoin stolen did not. So how is this a fiat problem...?
@_date: 2019-09-08 07:41:02


I shorted TSLA at $330, so I guess I'm beating you then? Made a bit shorting weed stocks too. Does this mean I'm a genius at TA???
@_date: 2019-09-30 09:50:55
So, OP.. how much was the mower? What's your debit card limit?
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:16:01


You're with the wrong super fund. Hostplus charged me $39 total in fees in 6 months, while making a return of over 10% on my money.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:41:55


lol keep dreaming
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:11:31


You're paying $1k, over 2% per year just in management fees for your SMSF.


Lol OK, I'll sell you one for $50k. Heck, I'll be generous and throw in a second one for free!
