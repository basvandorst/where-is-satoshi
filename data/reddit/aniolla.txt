I was looking forward to going to the bitcoin conference in Amsterdam last month. But they wanted 75 eu for student tickets and when those ran out they wanted 1,2 btc per ticket (650 eu or sm). Can't afford that shit. I am pretty sure the only way to pay in bitcoin was at the doorI lead a charity ( and that exposure would've been priceless! Can t afford those prices as an unemployed student ~.~so that s pretty bull ~.~

Well, for example because it includes an NFC chip in it, you could put any kind of information on it and scan it with your phone ( most of phones read NFC, excpect Iphones, but even Iphone 6 is adopting it). Let's say you want someone to send you some coins, save your BTC/ any other coin address on the card (chip), scan it on someone's phone and voila they have your bitcoin address. Say you want them to contact you, just save your contact information on, scan it with a phone, and it automatically goes into your contacts. You can also edit the information on the chip all the time, which makes it a little more useful than QR codes. You are welcome to PM for more information on different uses, colours, shipment, designs and etc.

Would it be? What if they only would sell to any other country but US? That would avoid that federal law, and international law doesn't have anything set up against it....

I just think that BTC is a start for something big. Crypto-currency is going to happen, if people want it or not.

I couldn't post a link because you would have to be paying for FT. SO I copy pasted it cause I found it interesting. And i have credited the author.

I disagree on many points with her. I see the definite comparison between BTC and Gold, i do not in any way believe it is useless.
I see a new start in BTC a new idea, that maybe we have a choice not to be succumbed by centralized authorities that print money out of thin air and sink into deeper deficits. 
This is not about worshiping something that has no intrinsic value, this is about how bitcoin made us think about how we look, think and spend money.

This is genius, dear sir. Let others expose your security threats for the better of the security of others. Bravo.
