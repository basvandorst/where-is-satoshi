One cause that is close to me is the rebuilding of the British Virgin Islands. I lived there for a while and this year it was devastated by two category five hurricanes. The local government does not have the money to rebuild the island and the British government has offered little to no support.
I know that they were accepting BTC donations at the time it happened; anything you could offer to them would be greatly appreciated I'm sure. So many lives were devastated in these hurricanes and although the US VI has garnered a lot of support from the US, the BVI is all alone.

Hmmm. If god trying to tell me to sell BTC, I’m gona stick with atheism. Maybe switch to devil worship. God just trying to fuck me over and buy cheap.

Ok, so this is still pretty incredible in my mind. Even if many other phrases are possible, the chances that this popped up when I clicked spin. So weird. I’d rate this over like finding a BTC...

Hmmm, but that’s not Base58 for a start. Also, is every possible combination used for Bitcoin Private Keys? 
EDIT: thought “i” was excluded as well as “I”, sorry.
Still pretty freaky that I clicked on spin the dice on keys.lol and this came up. Did it many more times afterwards to test and didn’t see any other words.

Ok; does that mean that every possible phrase that glass within the character length is possible? Not sure.
In any event, still pretty freaky - span the dice on keys.lol and this came up. Didn’t see any other phrases on there. Also it happened to be a coherent phrase, from all the values it could have been. Pretty weird.
@_date: 2018-09-09 04:40:13
Yea, I’m guessing people used low numbers to create seeds.
@_date: 2018-09-08 14:36:47
What do you mean? These are private keys on keys.lol. It’s weird no?
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:02:02
How did you find that? Can you search by phrase? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 14:38:33
That’s so weird no? Did you get a screenshot or the link on keys.lol? There must be a list of phrases that could be made from the available characters somewhere?
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:41:40
Yea probably!!

We have a great chance to hit $10k on Monday with options trading. This guy could have no balls by the end of next week!
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:58:44
Yea, but imagine a 100k BTC sell wall at $499k. It's gona cost him to save his dick and make that one buy!
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:18:15
If this really happens, I think there will be a huge sell wall at 499k. It will cost him dearly to break it down, or potentially more dearly not to!
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:52:33
Are you guys kidding? If he makes a buy order with a limit above current market price, it will fill from the current order book - if there are enough sell orders below the limit in the buy then he will get it below the buy price.
Go and enter a buy for 1BTC at $500k, it will fill close to current price. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:26:28
Don't leave us hanging...
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:33:17
We have another one! Two potential ball eatings.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:34:19
Hmmmm. I wouldn't go that far man. Now McAfee and dick eating at $499k/BTC i would personally love.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:32:45
How is this not a win win situation for you?
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:07:58
But that’s not how it works. I can set a sell now for 1 BTC at $500k. If someone else sets a buy for 1BTC at $500k, it buys from lowest sell order. Therefore, in order to buy at $500k, he would need to buy the book upto $500k, therefore my point about sell wall is correct. Do you guys trade?
He could OTC buy at $500k but that wouldn’t really fulfill the criteria in my mind.

Be careful making these kind of statements, you'll be the next one being called upon to dismember yourself!
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:35:42
Over Bitcoin or unrelated?

They can increase the number of decimals with a soft fork? Do you have a source for this?
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:23:42
I love his comment re: CME; you can hear the fear as his balls shrivel up in his sack, contemplating Monday and futures trading. 
If it goes $20k will you eat both u/calaber24p?
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:27:31
I'm surprised more people didn't pick up on this but yes - it is actually more than $10k there and still is I think.
