Sorry should have clarified. I mean the bech32 implementation that nopara made the bounty for. Thanks for responding.
@_date: 2019-03-10 05:24:08
The only solution you need and want to look at is wasabi.
@_date: 2019-03-08 12:09:11
But assuming someone commits what nopara is asking for, you'll implement it?
@_date: 2019-03-30 14:38:27
@_date: 2019-03-08 08:44:07
Why haven't you just done this yourselves yet?
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:31:26
Who cares about what regulators think, seriously? This is Bitcoin. Censor resistance or bust.
@_date: 2018-10-29 08:22:11
Trick title: real cryptocurrencies are decentralized and therefore saying they belong to a specific geography is meaningless.
@_date: 2018-10-17 12:33:06
This. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 11:48:50
So we should be more like and just aggressively hit the upvote button on every post? Sounds like a plan!
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:35:59
Amazing talk. Must watch even for people who've seen Andreas talk in his "normal" videos. This was inspirational.
@_date: 2018-10-18 00:24:29
It just forces legitimate people onto decentralized exchanges and further into the Bitcoin only economy. The game of cat and mouse continues...

Too much negativity toward these kinds of charts on this sub imo. If you don't like it fine, but a lot of these guys, especially the long term parabolic charts are quite well reasoned and have so far been quite accurate. You'll note the well known parabolic chart from 2014 has played out very well. You may think charting is just tea leaves, but actually Bitcoin price is very psychological. That's how good traders work, by understanding that mass psychology. Ignore the long term trend in Bitcoin at your own risk. Let the rest of us have fun trying to figure out when the next bull run will start. We may be off by a little bit in time or amount, but at least we'll be on the ride.

Bitcoin needs just two things to succeed: censor resistance and network effect. So far so good on both counts. 
Alts are inflation, but they will not displace Bitcoin in terms of network effect. The failure if BCH is proof of this. No serious fork attempt will happen for a long time because people get it now. The longer you stay in crypto, the more likely you are to come around to actually taking a look at and understanding Bitcoin.

What do you do after that address is marked and you later on want to spend the funds? Are there some best practices please to follow?
@_date: 2018-10-28 08:45:24
Thank you for this clarification!
@_date: 2018-10-25 15:29:19
I suppose one might want to tumble this address as well, for good measure.
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:27:08
What's the difference between  and  ? They seem to have different download options.
@_date: 2018-10-23 04:06:48
Not your keys, not your bitcoin. Holding your own coins is actually integral to the overall success of Bitcoin, since it is the ability of average people to take possession (and actual ownership) that makes Bitcoin markets resistant to manipulation by the big boys.
@_date: 2018-10-17 04:13:10
Everyone getting into crypto needs to spend some serious time watching this guy. I wonder if he has a sense yet of how big his role will be in 20 years. The whole world will be watching then. And we couldn't have a better person to be in that position. Thank you Andreas.

The main point the author misses is that yes many aspects of traditional banking will be recreated on Bitcoin, but with one crucial difference: Bitcoin monetary policy on layer 1 undergirds the bitcoin economy. In the current system, the monetary policy is corrupt to the core.
@_date: 2019-10-20 10:43:27
Experiment? Bitcoin is real!
@_date: 2019-10-31 07:49:10
Pompliano sells shitcoins and is not a friend of Bitcoin. He does paid shitcoin promotions. Go ahead and deny it Anthony. Say you've not taken a dollar in the past year to do social media promotion of a shitcoin. 
Yeah, that's what I thought.
@_date: 2019-08-26 06:28:39
The answer you're looking for is that we need Schnoor signatures and then channel factories can be opened with arbitrary number of participants using only one on chain input/output.
@_date: 2019-10-17 00:30:03
No, your Fiat has not bottomed yet. You're still able to buy sats with it.
@_date: 2019-10-16 10:44:58
If they're smart they sold all their shitcoins on Binance and went into hodl mode as a Bitcoin maximalist.
@_date: 2019-10-29 16:47:57
So the author never understood Bitcoin to begin with. So his original dystopian story is bs, and his update is bs. Carry on folks.
@_date: 2019-10-05 03:43:13
Interesting, why was gossiping on these deprecated? I would like to understand the incentive to do so.
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:26:51
We're not this far yet IMO. I'm not seeing the news reports talking about all the people going out buying nodes and hw wallets. Also the host mentioned that schools were teaching computer science. I don't think they're teaching Bitcoin yet. In other words, we're still VERY early!
@_date: 2019-10-05 03:11:43
I don't understand. Will this transaction not be gossiped as any other, reaching miner mempools? Miners certainly have an incentive to pick this up so long as the fees are adequate.
@_date: 2019-12-07 02:04:54
Just listen to the talk, the theory is laid out very clearly.
@_date: 2019-12-07 01:06:56
The answer is in here: 
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:03:33
Yup. The irony here is that black market prices will be higher!
@_date: 2019-04-06 12:10:57
What do you mean? They let you withdraw to bech32 or not?
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:34:41
Good except on his 100k forecast. That target will hit far faster than he says (which I assume is a joke anyway).
@_date: 2018-11-18 08:26:37
Please try to learn some more about Bitcoin before posting this kind of criticism.
@_date: 2018-11-11 00:49:36
Unless you're proposing a superior money, Bitcoin is here to stay.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:33:11
Find a good password cracker and do it yourself. Do not send your wallet file to anyone.
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:29:08
It can't. Voting is best done on paper with big empty boxes and a count done in front of cameras. End of story.

The Bitcoin welcome committee would like to welcome the people of Uganda. To the leaders of Uganda: You are doing a great thing for your country. Just don't trust your sovereign wealth fund with anything other than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-11 00:46:04
Who said they banned all websites about crypto??? Just Google huobi cny deposit. Not only can they use it, they can deposit fiat with ease.
@_date: 2018-11-02 05:21:13
I'll just wait patiently for this to happen again and we get to see all the Ron Paul "It's happening" memes.
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:25:22
It really needed that big illuminati eye, did it?

In other words, Apple users will be buying the next top. No complaints from me.
@_date: 2018-11-11 14:20:33
I found the bagholder. Please do some research on Bitcoin as sound money.
@_date: 2018-11-18 02:18:51
It's more or less impossible for a state to destroy Bitcoin. There aren't enough asic fabs out there for them to purchase the billion dollars of them that they need without people knowing. Second, even if they were able to get them OR if they marched into the mining centers in China, we would just fork and change the PoW. Social consensus will keep Bitcoin alive no matter what. More than anything else, Bitcoin is an idea, and "There is no stopping an idea whose time has come." It's users will dictate what it is and can keep it alive in the face of any challenge. 
Don't believe this ignorance people. Keep calm and Bitcoin on.
@_date: 2019-01-02 11:46:56
Afaiu LN requires a hot wallet. So not sure exactly how that would work.
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:41:37
The point is that it's not about Bitcoin. If it was about Bitcoin he would have said Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-09 09:14:33
If you're stressed out this much you're doing it wrong. Just HODL if trading isn't for you.
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:38:28
Where are you seeing this?
@_date: 2018-11-11 00:43:57
Tldr: some guy who doesn't really know says he "thinks" they may have some technical growing pains. I'm not giving this one much weight.
@_date: 2019-01-09 05:36:28
How can this crap be at the number 1 slot on the sub? The article does not even mention Bitcoin one time, and this guy works on some alt.
The quote is altered. He does not say Bitcoin is king, he says "blockchain" is king. 
Mods please remove the post for being off topic.
@_date: 2018-11-11 00:47:15
What is the point of this post?
@_date: 2018-11-02 03:22:08
If I saw two vendors side by side, one accepting only Bitcoin, and the other accepting Bitcoin + Scams, I would choose the one accepting only Bitcoin. But good luck.
@_date: 2018-12-27 12:09:29
Great reason to run a fullnode.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:30:38
Just use it with a hardware wallet.

You seriously aren't familiar with Banksy or this picture?

Your energy use good. Mine bad. Got it. Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:25:39
False: This is a fact.
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:27:32
I like how he kind of glosses over the fact that implicit in exit is non payment of tax. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:56:39
What a useless post.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:04:17
No argument from me here. But this I think reinforces my point about exit and non payment of taxes being a path to change.
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:16:26
Just stop. You have no idea what you're talking about.
