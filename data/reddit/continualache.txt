Depending on how you measure it... somewhere between 15 and 30 million.  I'm quite surprised, I thought there would be more.  They better get in early if they all want 1 BTC.

In a word "diversify".  No problem including some crypto in that, especially at the moment while it's on the rampage.  Just don't put everything in there and if you get a bit ahead then take a bit out and invest it in something else so that if crypto does take a dive you still got something out of it.   Always the same advice there, don't put all your eggs in one basket and don't spend everything you earn.  Save... basically.  There is still nothing wrong with gold and silver, they aren't going away and they do hold value.  The stockmarket doesn't have to be difficult.  With ETFs and managed funds you can pay small amounts into and slowly build up.  A lot of funds do better than 10% and if you reinvest your dividends it's surprising how it can add up over time.

1958 here.  I'm pretty sure most of the money driving up the price of bitcoin is not coming from the boomers.  It is mostly other millennials and genXers FOMO driving the price.  Personally, I've traded swings a bit and done some arbitrage but I see it as too risky to leave my money in.  I get in and out for a quick buck and leave it at that.  I really don't know many people my own age or older who are throwing all their cash in.  Bitcoin is mostly young taking from young.

Looks about ready for a big dump eh?

No, just sit and watch as it tics ever higher.  You can wait for the little drops like we just had but it's not like you're going to get a chance to buy low again unless it really crashes.
The good points are don't invest what you can't afford to lose and don't do anything in a panic.
BTC really is idiological... death to fiat, banks, govt control.
