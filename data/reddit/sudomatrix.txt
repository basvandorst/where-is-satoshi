pywallet can do two different things. It can find and export your keys from a wallet.dat file, but it can also scan an entire hard drive for a wallet file. This is what you want to do. The command looks something like this:
python pywallet.py --recover --recov\_size=500Gio --recov\_device=/dev/sda --recov\_outputdir=./recovered\_wallet 
Notes: It only works with python2, not python3. You have to tell it the size of your drive, it can't figure it out on it's own. "Gio" is a French abbreviation for Gigabyte (I think).  The command line would be a little different in Windows, eg: --recov\_device=E:

search your entire hard drive (including empty sectors) for the string 'wallet.dat' If it's there then the old wallet file \*may\* still be there. One way to do this search is to boot into a Linux live-cd, find which drive is your hard drive with "fdisk -l" (it's probably /dev/sda) and search the whole thing with grep: "grep -i wallet.dat /dev/sda"
If you find it, report back here.

That's great news!  Your wallet is in there somewhere. Go get pywallet to recover your wallet file or your keys. If you can't figure out how to use it, DM me.

I disagree with your interpretation. To me 'control' means you have a wallet with the forked coins in it and you have the ability to sell or transfer those forked coins. So when a fork happens you may not even know about it. But if you set up a wallet and 'claim' those forked coins by gaining control of them you have received value which, like it or not, is always a taxable event. If you don't want to owe tax on money you didn't get you can never set up the wallet in the first place (even knowing that there are actions you can take at a later date to gain control of those forked coins), or sell them immediately so it's simply income with tax due. -- the practical reality of the IRS knowing if you have set up a wallet of not is a different argument. They are setting the idealized guidelines of what you should owe on, regardless of the practicality of what they can catch.

Well they are better than the ridiculous stuff I was hearing before - that I technically owed money on every crazy fork ever - even if I never heard of it. And that the Coinbase tax report showing Bitcoins going in and out of my account were taxable, even though they were going to my own wallet.
@_date: 2019-11-13 19:35:49
I agree completely! Having to declare capital gains tax, and file the paperwork tracing transactions from cost basis to profit or loss - to buy a sandwich - effectively kills any chance of crypto being used as a day to day currency in the US.
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:56:51
On the first point, Coinbase sent reports to the IRS on over 10,000 people listing all the coins they transferred out of Coinbase with the 'cost basis' and profit those coins had. Until this clarification those people had to argue whether or not it counted as profit if they were just transferring the coins to their own accounts at another exchange or to a private wallet. And by 'argue' I mean hire expensive lawyers.

Yes, that was the part 2) I wrote about above. Note to  if you don't have any addresses and you don't have a Bitcoin full node I can help you skip that part. You can torrent the blockchain data from **blockchain.torrent** and extract the data you need from that. I'd have to walk you through it.
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:58:35
Realistically they can't. These are idealized guidelines for what the rules are so the IRS and lawyers and accountants can have a basis for their arguments. -- but you may *want* to show them your wallet if they are claiming you owe lots of taxes because you transferred coins out of Coinbase and Coinbase told them you have tons of profit.

If you remember most of it you can definitely recover the correct words. Either with btrecover or some custom Python. Tell us more details of what you have (don't tell us any of the words though!) and I'll give you some help.
@_date: 2019-10-25 04:25:36
It depends on how much of the original coin you have and what the forked altcoin is worth. Bitcoin Cash BCH is worth the most out of the forks, about $212/BCH right now. If you had 2 Bitcoins, you would have $424 in Bitcoin Cash.

Are you sure it was a 10-word seed? Mycelium uses standard 12 word seeds. Could it have been 12 words?
@_date: 2019-10-29 03:46:46
We are going to automate running through many variations of what you remember your seed to be. In order for a program to know when it finds the right seed it needs a way to recognize the right seed. There are two ways we can do that. (1) Look through your records and files, emails, find \*any\* public address that was from your wallet. Maybe you sent a transaction to someone? Maybe you received a transaction from someone? All we need is one address for the program to test the seed to see if it contains that address. (2) If you cant find any public address the only other method I can think of is we'll have to run this on a full node with the entire blockchain on it (I have one, or you will have to install one and wait for it to download the whole blockchain). The program can test each seed by looking up the addresses in the blockchain, see if any of them have been used. It will have to be local, looking them up on a blockchain explorer will be too slow (like years to run)

I'm going to make some new friends at the IRS when I send them thousands of pages tracking my bot-trading transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:43:40
As a client or as a CPA using your service I would request the option to choose which treatment I was comfortable using. As long as there isn't clear unambiguous guidance from the IRS I think that would be reasonable.

Wow. He never figured out the color-bar coding, he figured it out Sudoku-style by cross-referencing what color-bar combinations would correspond to valid words in the French BIP wordlist for all 6 words, then he wrote code to brute-force the last two words that he couldn't get.
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:42:13
It can't be based on the location's GPS because that's easy to get without actually travelling there...

On the far right there is black paint on black background saying '12 seed words'. this tells us we are looking for 12 words, most likely from the French word list. 
There is an old video showing PBOY painting with UV paint, showing he had worked with UV paint before. shining UV light on the painting reveals writing in three groups: to the left, above, and to the right of the woman's face. Some have found these to lead to a few words from the French word list. 
the background is made of colored bars. there are several areas (6?) where the colored bars are grouped into tight regular formations. the arrangement of colored bars might be translated into numbers then words.

Don't stare at this picture so long you get lost in the minutia.

Your solution says 'ATOUT' Caesar cipher + 20 = 'UNION'. That makes sense. Then it says 'JPAVFLU' Caesar cipher + 19 = 'CITIZEN'. That does not work. It seems to me that the clue would have been 'JPAPGLU' + 19 = 'CITIZEN'. What am I doing wrong?
EDIT: I just realized your solution page must have been auto-translated from French to English. Your seed words have also been translated, giving the \*wrong\* seed words. You should fix the solution page so the seed words are correct.

septem\_151 , conceptually Bitcoin transactions are of the form "Pay this money (unspent output) to someone with the right Public Key and Private Key". But it's actually a little more complicated than that. Bitcoin transactions are in the form of a tiny program (script) in a language that resembles "Forth" that compares your Public Key and transaction signed with your Private Key to a value stored in the transaction. However the script doesn't HAVE to just do that, it can take many other forms that implement things like Multiple Signatures (MultiSig) etc. Today almost all transactions use one of just a few "standard" programs (scripts) that have been nicknamed "P2PK" (Pay to public key), "P2PKH" (Pay to public key hash), "P2SH" (Pay to Script Hash), "P2WSH") (Pay to Witness Script Hash), etc etc. In fact they have become so standardized that nodes will no longer relay transactions to other nodes if they aren't one of the standard ones. This makes Bitcoin less flexible and less "programmable money" but is much safer from unintended bugs and problems.
The challenge we are talking about is a puzzle someone put into the blockchain in the form of a custom non-standard transaction script. Anyone who can figure out the script and/or values that will enable that custom script to run successfully can just take the money (about $20) by submitting a transaction that satisfies the script and transfers the money to their own address. The puzzle wasn't that hard and I solved it as many before me have, however since the solution is a non-standard script and no nodes will relay non-standard scripts anymore I cannot figure out a way to submit my solution transaction to the blockchain.
I suppose one way would be to join a mining pool and try to mine the transaction directly or with the help of the pool. I'm not getting into Bitcoin mining for a $20 prize though.

thanks PBOY, great fun!

What if a coin forks; I don't know about it so I don't report any income. Three years later I find out about it and of course my NewCoin is still sitting on the blockchain waiting for me so I take it and sell it. Now are you saying I am liable for penalties for not reporting the income that I didn't have or know existed three years ago?
Now modify my scenario. A coin forks; I don't know about it. My NewCoins have a value of $500,000 but eventually drop to zero and die out completely. I am not aware of any of this at any point. Am I liable for penalties for not reporting the income?
My point is that using your recommended treatment leads to all sorts of paradoxes and wrong outcomes. My suggested treatment works out logically. (not that the IRS is always logical)

By the way, unrelated to the puzzle, how do you paint such sharp clean QR code and Bitcoin address under the QR code? Did you print a template and cut it out for spraying?
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:22:36
How are the colored bars encoded? Take for example, group 2. I see 'Yellow Blue Blue Orange Yellow Blue Blue Peach Brown Peach'. The first letter is supposed to decode to 'U' in 'USURE'. There are six colors, so this is base-6. 'U' is letter  (decimal). In base-6 this is '33'. I would think the first two color bars would have to be the same color to represent '33' in base-6.
EDIT: I read how the winner solved this part, and he didn't. He cross-referenced all the color-bar codes with the French BIP wordlist like a giant Sudoku to get 4 of the words, then wrote code to brute-force the last 2 words. So he never did figure out how the color-bars are coded. Very clever.  [
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:36:47
I think perhaps I can tell the different spray strokes for the "relevant" parts just from the hi-res image, without actually being there. Or perhaps I'm completely off :-)
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:47:49
Does someone in Paris want to team up with me? I think I know how to solve it, and I thought I might be able to do it without being there from the hi-res picture, but I can't get everything I need without being up close.
Edit: I found a detail in the photo that I think PBOY staged on purpose as a "confirmation" that the method I am thinking is correct.
@_date: 2019-01-15 04:48:54
But how does the color-bar coding work?
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:25:29
hmm I see the problem. my sig script runs first then the script embedded in the transaction runs last so there is no way I can clean up the stack
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:37:46
Actually in this case I don't. I wrote my bot and it keeps a log of every transaction. Any same coin transaction is treated as a non-taxable transfer between exchanges or wallet to exchange. Any transaction that changes one coin with another or with USD is treated as a taxable transfer and calculates the small gain or loss on that transaction. At the end of the year I import the log file into Excel, filter out the year by date and sum the gains and losses.
Since I wrote it I have all the details across wallets and exchanges. Tracking this any other way trying to cross-reference several exchanges' reports would be a nightmare.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:22:23
No offense, but that recommendation is terrible.
There are many forks I never even hear about. Some gain traction, some die out without much press. There is no way I am responsible for paying income for each of them. Most exchanges don't even support forks unless they become very popular, so I don't even have access to them.
Just to prove my point I can write code to auto-generate a NEW FORK with a random name each and every day, knowing they all will die out, but by your recommendation causing a taxable income event for every single holder of the original coin in the country.
Sorry, I don't buy it. I will report the forks I know about with a basis of zero and a gain of whatever I sell it for. Just because some group of pump and dumper coders creates their own fork doesn't assign a value to it.
*EDIT: My writing sounds harsh so I just want to clarify that I think your service is a great idea and very needed right now, I just disagree with this one statement.

Based on the responses, I guess my post wasn't clear. I have all that: paper wallets spread out, TOTP 2FA not SMS, hardware wallets, etc.
What do people think about being publicly vocal about cryptocurrencies when that paints a target on you for hackers. I provided a link that illustrates the threat, but here are more:
