User-friendly web-based GUI for Counterparty (the first functioning trustless crypto exchange) goes Live!

Sorry, but your way of handling this type of incident is messed up. 
For God's sake, this seems to be a Multibit bug causing random users to lose arbitrary amounts of BTC. Not addressing this responsibly can severely tarnish your reputation.

Right now it is using a simple timer for the 24-hour delay. Of course such a system can be bypassed without too much effort by any reverse engineer, but 99% of users are not reverse engineers. Also, the coins would still be safe in that scenario.  
That said, we may switch to a timelock puzzle if needed. We want this tool to be able to operate with no Internet connectivity, so nLockTime is not an option. 
Also, remember that the security of the system is not based on the time limit mechanism. What we're trying to achieve is simply, a time safe that helps keep self-discipline. In that context, we don't necessarily want the time limit mechanism to be "secure" in a cryptographic sense. Its only function is to raise the bar high enough to keep a typical user from using the coins for some time.

Which script, which language, which modules, which dictionaries, on which hardware, etc.  Extra points if you also describe your thought process to select all of the above.  This type of information is extremely informative to the security community. 
On second thought, I will cross post this on as it's probably more relevant there and will attract fewer non-technical trolls.

The 0.101 will be paid from my wallet directly. The reason I'm not funding the brainwallet itself with this amount is to avoid somebody cracking it and running away quietly, without sharing their method or experience with the community. This is also supposed to be a learning experiment.

Amazing milestone!

Easy, just don't participate if you're skeptical. And nobody forces you to donate coins to that address.

Good luck!
@_date: 2014-06-12 06:08:03
Yes, nobody found the correct passphrase, which was:
took28 five74 gold14
By the way, it was hand-chosen (not randomly generated.)
Episode 2 (similar challenge) will start shortly and will be cross-posted to @_date: 2014-06-10 09:45:47
What language are you using? If you are only getting 100 checks per second per core, you're doing something wrong IMHO.
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:14:03
If you like this, you'll love the chainsnort script. :)  Look it up.

Try contacting flatfly on the bitcointalk forum. He's the go-to guy for Electrum on Windows.
@_date: 2012-08-24 21:33:06
Actually 0.6 already does, just click on the padlock icon to enable strong (AES) encryption. and performance doesn't suffer at all.
@_date: 2012-08-26 19:09:51
Seems that the 1-click installer for windows has just been released.
The download link is on electrum-desktop.com.

Known bug in MultiBit / bitcoinJ. I bet that's the client OP is using. 
@_date: 2012-08-24 14:37:11
In light of the increasingly unmanageable growth of 
the blockchain database (3.5GB and counting), more and 
more "ordinary" users abandon the bitcoin.org client and 
look for alternatives, such as Electrum, MultiBit, Armory, 
or web-based wallets.
So far, Electrum seems to be the one leading the bunch 
in the safety, stability, and convenience departments - 
though all of them are still early-stage software, with some rough edges.
Unique downloads now average about 2200-2300 per month, and growing fast!

@_date: 2012-08-24 19:09:34
How so?
@_date: 2012-08-24 19:32:46
I checked the source code. It's fetching the exchange rates from there. Can be modified or disabled easily if you know your way around Python.
@_date: 2012-09-18 13:32:13
To restore your wallet, you need to delete the Electrum directory, not the Electrum_SysFiles one. They should both be located in the same folder (Application Data)
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:40:16
This is a great idea. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-04 11:02:17
Electrum seeds are extremely secure. 
@_date: 2013-09-27 11:01:24
er... this is about multibit, not walletbit (which, incidentally, went bust last july)

NoBrainr is a new, simple yet robust open-source command-line tool that I made with my awesome bitcoin-obsessed buddy, flatfly. Any comments welcome, and feel free to criticize if needed!
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:05:08
Check out Electrum and its deterministic seeds then, I'm sure you'll like it.
Plus it's the only wallet that has never been hacked, to my knowledge.
@_date: 2013-11-04 10:59:50
Or, NoBrainr. It's tiny, robust and runs locally:
 
The only remotely plausible risk is a compromised RNG. But then ALL Bitcoin clients are affected.
A later version will even accept physical entropy as input (a la diceware.)
@_date: 2013-05-18 17:05:50
He did publish an unusually high number of papers on elliptic curve math... And his writing style is very consistent with Satoshi's. If that's not a compelling clue I don't know what is. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:11:43
Wait, so you're telling me there's a chance? :)
The ["Deep Space Vagabond"]( thread at bitcointalk is also a nice read about this topic. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:37:55
It is at least as trustworthy as bitcoin-qt. The only thing that makes me uneasy about it is the Java requirement.
I'm partial to the other lightweight client, Electrum.
@_date: 2013-09-27 11:05:14
You might try to salvage those keys from the raw wallet files using a good OSX hex editor such as Synalysis. Some veteran users on bitcointalk can help you with that if needed.
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:50:17
Definitely not normal. What OS / Python version?
Only Python 2.x is supported. We will check for this requirement in the next version.
@_date: 2013-05-13 08:06:02
This. If you have the Java plugin (yes, even for Chrome), there's your backdoor. Sad but true.
This has nothing to do with Windows by the way, it could just as easily happen with Linux or MacOS. Just stay away from the Java plugin.
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:46:53
The whole point of this program is, it doesn't let you select the passphrase, it does that for you. The reason why is that humans are typically very bad at choosing high-entropy AND easy-to-memorize passphrases, which typically leads to catastrophic theft in the context of bitcoin. 
You might wish to read up on passphrase entropy, and specifically the diceware method, as this is what NoBrainr is emulating.
@_date: 2013-05-07 06:23:17
Wow, the imgur screenshot filename is just one character short of being a perfect palindrome! How amazing is that?
@_date: 2013-10-10 18:07:52
Yes, sorry, "sudo pip install ecdsa" should do it. 
I'll be sure to mention this requirement on the website.
Usage: it's a simple command-line tool with no parameters whatsoever in the current version. 
Just run it (preferably on an offline computer) and it will generate a hack-proof and easy-to-remember 90-bit brainwallet.
@_date: 2013-10-11 09:09:39
I have just fixed the line endings issue for OSX / Linux. (Instead of modifying the code, I've changed the wordlist file itself)
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:59:29
Did you use an obscure song quote or something? How long?
It would be nice to disclose the passphrase once the address is empty, to help people realize, once and for all, that human-chosen brainwallet passphrases really are a very bad idea.
Another crazy example: "bitcoin is awesome" (501 BTC.)
