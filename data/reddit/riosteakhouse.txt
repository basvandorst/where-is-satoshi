The sounds and smells of sizzling steak are what Rio Brazilian Steakhouse in Plymouth, Massachusetts, is known for. But a year ago, the owners of the churrascaria decided to dabble in the hottest currency, Bitcoin.
“The main reason was to get new customers at the door,” said Vagmar Stoffel, co-owner of Rio Brazilian Steakhouse.
