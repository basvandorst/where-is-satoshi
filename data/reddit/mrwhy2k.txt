Been earning a bit of bitcoin on Listia,   ... sort of like ebay.

Howard Stern mentioned bitcoin yesterday as well.

This looks like a lot of fun to set up... even if it loses money.

Actually moving fairly quickly on this.

You can still choose not to use a business that is regulated by NYS. I think for some people like traders, this will give them a sense of security and allow for bitcoin to grow. For others, they want to be off the grid and won't use services such as this in the future. I like that both are available.

I see the problem, I just think bitpay and other services will now build in tracking services to take care of this in the near future... and charge money for it ;)

Very good point! $100mil flooding into the ETF would move the value of 1 bitcoin 2x - 10x, and a billion dollar ETF could quickly happen.

I've looked at a lot of charts, never looked at a price chart and bitcoin address correlation. 
I think the price would ramp up a lot quicker than you think if 50M+ people were using it. But other than that, looks sound to me.

CEX gets more strange everyday. I lost money trying to mine, but they keep pulling me back with strange ways to attempt to make money. 
I think cloud mining can be done with profit, but not sure CEX is offering the right solution.

But if you have a paper wallet in your home, and a fire burns down your house, the piece of paper is worth X. So the insurance company should replayed destroyed property or cut you a check... right?

The loss is only real when you sell. Unless you need the money for something, ride it out. You'll feel like shit next week when it's back up to $500.
Remember the last time it fell to $400, it bounced to $700 in 5 days.

Use Listia.com to sell your stickers, then take your credits and buy bitcoin on Listia... just free money

My guess is, lots of other papers are starting their own investigations to find the REAL inventor of bitcoin and make Newsweek look like even bigger fools.

If banks would start selling bitcoin, and handle storage and make it easy to convert and exchange, bitcoin would go mainstream overnight.
@_date: 2014-07-08 22:28:13
I can't decide if i want the price to shoot up, or stabilize making bitcoin more viable.

How is he calling out the price of tulips at "$75,000", no one really knows how much "tulip" bubble was worth. People compare it to being worth 5000 bushels of wheat. Some historians are not even sure if the tulip bubble really happened at all.
And if it was $75000 back in 1600s, then that would be like $1m+ inflation adjusted todays money. 
I'm starting to think Jamie ain't so smart.

The only problem, you're not taking into account the larger 2mb block size of 2x. If 1x falls behind, and 2mb blocks have the hash power, the 1x chain will quickly fall out of sync, and never be able to catch up. The longest chain will be 2x.

This halving will be fun to watch play out, but thinking ahead to 2020 and future halving, it will be very interesting to see what happens fewer and fewer mining operations pull the plug. What will happen in hundred years when there are no more coins mine? Will all mining operation cease?
