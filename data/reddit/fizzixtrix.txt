Update: After typing in a SCARY amount of personal info for validation, I was declined for an account because it was not available in my area yet, California. These are things this website asked me in order to verify my personal identity, beyond my basic name and address information: I was asked to choose from a variety of names and pick which name was most closely associated with me (One of the names was my father's name and the rest were all hispanic male names I don't know anyone by), I was asked to choose from a variety of zip codes which zip code was most closely related to me (One of them was the zip code from a past out-of-state address, the rest were foreign to me). I was also asked to chose which of the given groups of numbers best represented the first three digits of my SSN, where I found an exact match for mine, among a variety of others. Interesting...

I apologize if this question has already been asked, but: Will California be in the next wave of launching? I am very interested in helping out the propagation of any and all things Bitcoin, and would love to know if there is an opportunity in California for Trucoin, that I can devote my time and energy into!

Bitcoin is a digital currency system that can globally redistribute wealth and power if widely used.

I can imagine CA is a piece of work for this... Thanks for your response!

Since you took away only negativity from my post: Anyone who read my post should be able to tell that I never once implied anyone should skirt any law. And, if YOU actually read other posts, you'd realize that I already did know it wasn't available in CA, and only went through the process to see what it was like, so I could share with others. I found it interesting that, even knowing their service wasn't available to me in my region, they would still go through the whole process of collecting personal info way beyond my location, before declining. Maybe you should have read further into the content I provided, and other post interaction, before wasting your time replying to my post. I was trying to share some simple info in case someone else could possibly benefit from it, and if you don't benefit from it, that's okay. I know people who would be interested to know that the process requires the things I mentioned, and I posted the info for those people.
