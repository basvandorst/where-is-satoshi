I've used them in the Philippines and it was pretty smooth. They've partnered with one of the largest shipping and remittance companies there (LBC) where you can just cash in your Abra money into pesos. There's a small fee, but I don't remember how much it was.

This is the problem with the terminology being used all over the place, incorrectly. It wasn't a 'rollback'. It was a transfer of funds. Transactions were not rolled back and the Ethereum blockchain didn't revert back to a previous block.

Also, he mentioned the Filipina lady who sends money back to Philippines from Canada using Abra. Abra isn't available in Canada yet.

Section 5.1 in 
@_date: 2015-12-04 10:41:54
Not sure where you got that from. Read the last sentence. 5.1 says...
5.1. USD Wallets. Users who have verified their identity with Coinbase and who reside in approved jurisdictions may establish and fund a U.S. Dollar balance ("USD Wallet"). Except as otherwise set forth herein, you may use your USD Wallet only to purchase bitcoin from Coinbase, to receive the proceeds of bitcoin sales to Coinbase, or to transfer funds to and from a Coinbase Trading Account. You are the owner of the balance of your USD Wallet. Coinbase holds your USD balance as custodian, in an account with an FDIC-insured financial institution. Your USD Wallet balance is insured for your benefit by the FDIC.

None of those companies are 100% vested in the success of bitcoin and/or have done very little to add to the ecosystem. Coinbase needs bitcoin to succeed as a peer to peer cash system. They've added tremendous value to the onramping for new users all around the world and for retail involvement. I think their voice deserves to be heard as well.

Digital Gold. Very good read. They should make a movie based on it.

Overdraft protection isn't needed with bitcoin. You can't spend more than you  have.

I know he joined the advisory board of Hyperledger, but I don't think he left IBM.

I completely agree. The masses who use bitcoin don't care, or even know anything about running a node. They just want bitcoin to work fast and cheap. If that doesn't work for them and a competitor coin comes up that does, they'll use it instead.
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:34:53
Who defines what the proper use of bitcoin is? I like using it for online purchases because it's easier than credit cards. And I use it to load prepaid value of my phone when I'm traveling cause it's easier than having to go to a store to buy the prepaid cards. Those are some of the biggest benefits for me. Is that wrong?

It looks like those tweets are him quoting Martin Wolf. Hard to tell if he's in agreement or not though. Levitt is an advisor to BitPay.

If you watch the video, the guy says that the bitcoin blockchain in the long run, is unsustainable? Around 3:40 mark.

The way he talks about bitcoin in the end, he isn't being dismissive about it. Sounds like once it's regulated, they'll transact in it.

Bitcoin allows the development of killer apps.

That's interesting. Got a link?

Setup an account at coins.ph and install their app on your mobile. Send your bitcoin to that wallet. 
When you arrive there, get a sim card for your phone at the airport, with a data plan.
In the Coins app, go to Cash Out, and select cardless ATM withdrawal, sending funds to your phone. 
You'll get an SMS with a 16 digit code and an email with a 4 digit code. 
Go to one of the many Security Bank ATMs (yes, the name of the bank is called Security Bank) and voila, you can take out pesos without a bank card.

Hearn wants usability by ALL. The other side wants to limit that by making it more of a settlement currency for big spenders. I think Nathaniel conveyed it accurately.

Good answer. Everyone here thinks that Vitalik makes the final decision on any forks. He doesn't. He's just a voice with ideas. The community has to agree to any changes. Just like bitcoin.

Agreed. He doesn't seem to have the characteristics of executive management. I know Blockstream is all about decentralization, but a for-profit company is still about making money and getting the right team in place is important. Social media jabs are fun, but don't help advance the strategy of a company. He perhaps got hired because he's a strong ally.

Are other cryptos supported, or just BTC?
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:19:36
Did these companies ever say they're NOT going to use Bitcoin? Maybe they will, but don't want the public distracted by the currency aspect of the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:42:03
You can also use Google Finance's BTC price...
And you can see it in other the currencies too. For example, to see BTC in Canadian dollars, use...

This event seems to be geared towards Cisco's top tier customers. Interesting. Maybe 21inc's product is closer at hand and this is to prepare these customers for what's ahead from Cisco related to bitcoin.

He said 'participants', which is not just the miners.
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:43:42
Great explanation. Small steps at removing friction.
@_date: 2015-09-24 08:18:54
Yes, I agree it can be done with a PC and eventually competing products will come to market. But this is the first one that has an integrated function of acquiring and spending bitcoins with a simple interface. They're the first to market. If the product delivers, it can effectively bootstrap the network effect of a closed bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:13:38
This is the first product in its class. It's the first real product that can close the loop of acquiring and spending bitcoin as an economy. This is why it's so exciting to me.

That just gets me a little computer with a bitcoin wallet on it. But more importantly, without the functionality that 21 offers. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:44:19
I think he means of not having to spend a week or so to create the same functionality. It's an off the shelf solution. That's worth $400 for some. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:23:16
Every computer is not a bitcoin computer. It has the potential to be a bitcoin computer. If what you're saying can be done, then I look forward to the competition that 21 will spur. It'll be good for bitcoin.

I think bitcoin remittance companies would be a good source to buy OTC.

Andreessen Horowitz are investors in Coinbase and 21inc. The CEO OF 21inc is also a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. 21inc needs bigger blocks to support mass use of their core product. Union Square Ventures, one of the largest VCs in NYC also funded Coinbase. These guys don't get bullied by the companies they fund. And I'm sure 'a scientific framework' won't convince them to change their minds - they don't invest in intangibles and empty promises. They're smart, and put their money where they see the highest probability of success and payback.
@_date: 2015-10-13 14:10:32
Exactly. The community is so torn up that if Coinbase does nothing, they're non contributors. If they do something, they'll be accused of an evil ulterior motive. They can't win, unfortunately, in this community. I think they're doing the best thing they can under these circumstances, which is simply communicating what they prefer.

Could be. But then why wouldn't they disclose that? Although it's common for companies now to avoid the word 'bitcoin', I find it odd that they avoid the word 'blockchain' as well. Lots of room for speculation.

Your analogy is pretty bad.
1. Most users will not run a full bitcoin node on their PC because most users will not actively see a direct benefit for doing this. SPV wallets will be the norm for regular users. I mention this because you said "ordinary Windows user".
2. With torrents, you need to share to receive. This is the only reason why clients act as a 'node'. If given a client choice where they can just receive without reciprocating, most users would take it.
3. Torrents don't experience bottlenecks when too many users are active.
4. There is no burning platform for the BitTorrent protocol to change, due to insufficient network capacity.
5. BitTorrent is actually more successful when there are more active users on it.

I think smart contacts are coming up too, but 21inc's bitcoin computer is all premised on acquiring satoshis and spending them for content. Lots of potential to go around though. Fred Wilson (USV) and Wences Cesares (Xapo) believe identity management is the lower hanging fruit. In fact, identity via satoshis aligns with micropayments as well.
