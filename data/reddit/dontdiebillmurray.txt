Enough! Honestly! Give up on this cybernetic economy war amongst tech geeks! The technology was created  by and is orientated solely toward people with an IT background and will never be adopted by the other 95% of society. Wake up nerds; you’re going to have to work for a living.

It’s not about the elderly. The tech and jargon is too dense for a laymen of any age. I.e. most of the earths population.
What you’re talking will take a generations time of global socioeconomics shifting. Sure, 20-30 years from now, who knows. Solid argument. I can make the same for entirely everything not yet publicly accepted. You can throw this thread in my face in 2040 when these crypto ponzi runners have finally stopped fucking each other over.

Cryptocurrency does not serve the public like the internet. How many people need to transfer large amounts of capital on a global scale on a regular basis? This shit is not the next internet. However your argument is impossible to dispute based on the fact that it draws purely from speculation. You can soak in your tub of self righteousness for the next decade if it pleases you.

Somehow you made an attempt at a paragraph summation too dense to serve your argument. And in the meantime, until any of these conflicting self-interested tech companies come together and stop undercutting each other, which will never happen as this entire thing is about a select few getting rich, this deluded millennial fever dream you all are living will never happen.

You’re right about one thing only; monitoring this sub has been an utter waste of my time.
