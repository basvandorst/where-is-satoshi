About "Ivy for Bitcoin": Thank you guys!!!! Finally !!!


Turing completeness for smart contracts is evil. Like the contract language in Ethereum, -  the Solidity is the evil. It proved itself very fragile and not protected against developers those shoot themselves into legs. You will see disruption of Ethereum network over and over again with dumb-ass contracts as we have seen this year with many ICOs and last year with "The DAO".

sigh... If Bitcoin will only bought and never sold, then Bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is exemplary technology, however it is not the only one. And there will be always alts, cloned, build from scratch, with new and mix of old ideas. The idea of HODLing is so biased ... In 40 years we will have so much different hardware that will be like 53 times faster (by Moors law). Or if you take in account two technological leaps those suppose to come in next 40 years, then computer hardware will be at least two orders of magnitude faster, AND SO FCKING DIFERENT, that Bitcoin as a software will have to change or die.

Slang is always invented not by most intelligent individuals, but by lazy ones.  The idea of the distributed ledger working in a trust-less environment which includes not only the block chain, the gossip protocol, and as well as lot of another stuff, is impossible to translate into simple noun or sentence, which is understood by common folk. Using the "blockchain" as a noun seems to be a good idea to identify complexity of bunch of technologies those were brought by Bitcoin to ... Guess what ? To the common folk. There are not a lot of people, those would  say: "I'm interested in Bitcoin". Because it is the same as to say "I'm interested in drugs". You can't deny that for general public, those are nearly equivalents.   
So. Do not be a grammar Nazi. Use the "blockchain" noun. Simplify the idea. Make this idea leave a separate life (separate from Bitcoin or alts). Imprint this idea into minds of everyone. After they do not associate "blockchain" with drugs, terrorism and Silkroad, associate "blockchain" with Bitcoin again. Say: "Bitcoin brought the blockchain into the masses. Btw, those are two words: block chain" Profit.

Of course those alts are guilty. Not the 2 years long block size debates. Not the split in the Bitcoin community. Reading the comments here, I find them immature, overemotional and absolutely useless. Those alts taking the niche provided by Bitcoin. Ppl behind those alts working hard and staying focused in dedication to provide something that bitcoins lack. You guys can continue to spit further on all alts and call them shitcoins. The reality is, - nothing will change for Bitcoin if you'll not pull yourselves together and start thinking on what is the market need, and not what Bitcoin measure in USD or CNY you wish to see just by sitting on your hands.

@_date: 2016-06-11 04:38:19


1. How the zero sum can affect the volume ?
2. Whatever they do there in China, they trade for CNY. With no regards to what exactly happening there those deals are concluded. The volume does exist. Bitcoin network processing transactions and gets its fees. Isn't it ? 
So I can not believe that the volume can be useless in these circumstances.

It will not drop bellow $600, the halving will make it really difficult economically for miners. If it falls before halving below $600 I'll buy as much as i can, because after halving you can't expect the price below $800. Every price rise have a reason. Right now $420 is the minimum which makes mining at least profitable. But in reality halving should make prices even higher.

I probably was not clear enough: There is no China to West transfers of significant amounts to prove significant capital overseas transfers or money laundering. BTC traded for CNY are not traded for USD or EURO for equivalent amounts, not even for 10% of the BTC/CNY trade volumes.

Why someone should expect the X-Mass and NY spikes to be sustainable? What I do not understand, where the fuck those $4.5 billions, which are responsible for that spike, are coming from? I can't believe that there were so many ppl, those very craving for BTC ... Let me throw up the theory: Those were the Russian hackers and Putin himself, who put those billions into Bitcoin and then raped all the nubs buying on hype. Another one: that is the Google's Deep Mind AI playing on exchanges in Go. And another one: That was the China's government, decided to buy MOAR of BTC and drop the price to show that CYN is not devolving in comparison to other currencies, thus teaching a lesson to all the Chines ppl dared to buy in at $1130.

I do not believe all those buzz on news, and all that circus in USA-Russia relations, which is apparently made for public, has something to do with real politics. Presidents of both countries are not stupid. Russia need cold war to consolidate and to improve internal economy. US needs big enemy to revive internal industry. Why the fuck not to conclude a deal, to make a big ruckus and shit each another in public, and then benefit on it.
If US will drop sanctions, Russia will start import all the shit from outside again and internal production will drop. Huge amount of ppl will lose their jobs and businesses. The US and Europe gain from "great threat" posed by Russia, by increasing funding into military and in the end into companies working for military. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 23:03:01
Ok. I believe that I've  got your point. Let me rephrase it strait: There are same amount of Bitcoins traded on Chinese exchanges over and over to generate higher volumes and therefore look more important.
I have some problems with this:
1. What can stop those exchanges to lie about trade volumes ? Or if not lie then setup the bunch of bots to sell/buy to themselves non stop ? Because there is no evidence they are doing this non-stop, -  you see the floating volumes through the day, the week and the month, etc. And you see the prices reflecting the market prices.
2. Who guarantees that you sell to yourself ? Those are the exchanges, not the ebay or the shop. That is not how the exchanges are working. You can't choose whom you sell to  and whom you are buying off.  
3. Trading to yourself with steadily increasing price for every turnover can get the price to the moon. And this will be a fraud. Trading to yourself is a fraud. You can manipulate prices at will. 
I can't believe Chinese doing those things you say, because that they are doing business, they are efficient at doing business and as any business they care about their reputations and profits.
One more thing: OKcoin.cn does not have all accounts with zero fees, only the VIP ones.

They already do this "draconian shit". They can't control the cryptocurrencies themselves, but they can make laws to forbid for regular Russians to use it or trade it. If you are not aware, they have laws in place those obligate the ISPs to keep total surveillance on internet activities within their reach. It is a "lawful MITM" enforced this year and not yet implemented because of the costs. Though it is in process, because the ISPs and their users are obligated to pay for this. This kind of an additional rip off  of the Russian people for the taxes they pay, without even asking their consent. They already forbid VPNs and so one. So technically they can't control cryptocurrencies, but they control their people and their access to Internet. Most of the Russians are so stupid they even do not understand how the government fucks them every day with every new law.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:10:26
huh. this part exactly means nothing in context of bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. What he means really: How the fuck should we develop our financial system, when this uncontrollable shit takes money out of our hands and makes it impossible to control money flows. I've seen lot of recent Russian news related to cryptocurrencies. What they really want is the control. They try to forbid trading or exchange fiat to crypto and wise versa for regular ppl and leave it in hands of "professionals". They want to make it possible to trade bitcoin/crytptos only for those who have a broker licenses. Moscow Exchange plays not the last part in it. The head of exchange in his recent statement was against the foreign exchanges accepting Russian citizens as traders. In the same time they are preparing the online exchange for cryptocurrencies and joined Hyperledger.
So expect more pressure to Bitcoin from Russians in close future. Expect more FUD about Bitcoin from them and expect them to rob their ppl further. They will try to forbid anything they can't control.

In clear words: he wants control over it. Ppl do not need protection in this regard. Business only need "protection" if they want to seize control over it. So fu russia and any other govts, those  want to save us from crypto.

it is very profitable to shill this shit on polo to the fools those are thinking they investing in their future. Those coins are running and running over and over, hype, fud, hype, fud, btcoin up, bitcoin down, sell, buy, sell , buy... Margin trading on polo are under very heavy load all day long, and those Margin tradings provide a lot of BTC as profit.
And when you transfer XRP to gatehub, you have a chance to buy BTC for like 100-150USD cheaper then on polo.

Ok. lets do the math together. coinmarketcap.com now: Ripple cap 12,349,454,990 USD
current xrp price: 0.325366USD 
xrp tokens in supply 37,955,579,225
The market cap is 0.325366 * 37,955,579,225 = 12,349,454,990 check.
Ouch! there are unexpectedy 62 billions of shit tokens more then expected!!! Inflation?
12,349,454,990 USD / 100 000 000 000 XRP == 0.12349 USD per XRP :)
What about real cap? Coins hold by Ripple (not counted in mcap) 62 039 317 765 XRP.
62 039 317 765 / 37,955,579,225 = 1.63 times inflation ... 63% actually ...
12,349,454,990 * 0.47 = 5 804 243 845.30 oops it is a cap at best not including that what will happen if ppl will realize thier shit coins cost 3 times less then they expected :)
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:56:11
You can't be so naive, are you ?
As far as the ripple holds those 62 billions of xrp, those are virtually unavailable to anyone else and cap is calculated from circulating supply so it is 12 billions now: 
Suppose ripple has released those 62 billions xrp today to public.
It is an emission. Assuming you buying those released tokens for the same price as now in whole amount, - you will have your capitalization growth. 
Will the price keep if Ripple releases all or just a fraction of those shit tokens today? No way. Price will fall as a brick and you should pray that you'll keep capitalization :)
If my math and arguments are making no sense to you, then I'm the wrong doctor here. 
Your and that moron's Eik_NL  logic suggests if ripple to release 200 billions of xrp-shit-tokens today the price of those shit tokens will be the same and capitalization will grow for 300% that instant :)
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:18:19
How did you come with 30 billions?
Lets do it together:
MarketCap now: 11319302614 USD 
Total XRP: 100000000000
11319302614/100000000000 = 0.113193 USD per XRP ....
Ouch price is almost 3 times  less then it now ...
How so?

Lol :) it does not matter if I would run my own node. Ripple is at its limits and it is purely scales horizontally. I tryed on gatehub, - slow as hell, charts.ripple.com - slow as hell. Ripple network is at its limits with polo traffic. And polo hangs most when XRP trades are rising in volume. BTW it prevents this shit token from falling in price, because anny crash of this bubble you can watch only 1 frame at a minute. And ppl are unable to realize that it is crashing. So this bubble will go on ... Amazing

Ripple owns 62 Billions of XRP those are not taken into account when calculating Ripple capitalization: 
Coinmarketcap.com calculates capitalization from roughly 37 Billions of XRP released to public instead of whole amount which is about 100 Billions.
Considering XRP price at the time of writing 0.298225USD, the real marketcap if Ripple network is about 2,9 Billions. Ouch! It is more then 3 times less then announced.
XRP tokens are the transport tokens in Ripple network. Banks are transferring FIAT between each another, in the Ripple network it works like in BitShare, - this fiat is margin traded on ripple network FIAT-xrp-FIAT (gate to gate), and banks will win if the XRP price goes down. As far as XRP fees are more profitable for banks and XRP price is not being obstacle for their transactions Ripple probably will not release their bunch of shit-tokens. 
Nevertheless, XRP is not a crypto at all. It is barely decentrilized in technical sens - 26 nodes only. And totally centralized in the sens of governance and control over it. All the nodes belong to Ripple.
Latest press releases from Ripple are suggesting that they will add 3d party trusted audit nodes (there will be 16 only, they can't scale higher).
In the fact from the technical sens, ripple have no innovations at all. It is a middle-size distributed cluster totally controlled by one company (and  "trusted 3rd parties" in future). 
In any way at no point Ripple can make a guarantee that the next software release they provide will not increase amount of XRP to next 200 billions. No one can prevent Ripple from doing whatever they want with their  protocols on Ripple network. There is no way, that community or those banks themselves, can prevent Ripple to do whatever they pleased with it.
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:53:00
The only shit "token" on polo is the XRP (no block chain there), which causing freezes and flooding the ripple network. At the same time as polo have freezes, the ripple network is freezing as well. Almost any ripple and 3rd party services are barely moving and transactions failing because they are timing out.
Polo, move this shit token out of the normal exchange ! Make for those shills a separate xrp.bubble.poloniex.com site.
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:15:38
yeas, you might be correct. However all those freezes on polo, all that "DDoS" shit is happening exactly before that XRP bubble about to crash. Then you are watching it in a slow motion frame per 20-30 seconds, how slowly and gently it goes down and panic sells are impossible at that moment :) Excellent :) They will continue that for a long time.
Btw, when polo volumes decreasing gatehub are actually working fine ...
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:13:35
I have to admit it, I was wrong about fiat-xrp-fiat trades. It seems that it is only polo hype, no banks are listed in transactions or volumes 
Thank killerstorm for the link to the charts (see his post bellow). Btw those charts showing even more fake capitalization then CMC.
78% volume is the polo volumes. And ripple network is very crippled now, only 14 validation nodes left and it is slow as hell. I couldn't make a BTC trade last half an hour, - transactions are timed out.
I wonder if polo XRP trades are made on ripple network, and this makes polo so slow lately.
