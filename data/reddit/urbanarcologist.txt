read up on typesetting - it's not that hard and ~~straight~~ smooth lines would make it much cleaner and is needed for any irregular or slender text frames.  Lover of typography.

It's certainly important to the larger world around bitcoin. 
i.e. IRS Tax on assets.

There is no tax on fiat currency if they increase in value relative to any other currency.
I believe we are talking past one another, my only point is, wording matters as a means to classify, and those classifications have consequences, which may or may not slow bitcoin adoption and use. I think it should be in a class on its own, with 0 taxation. But what I want doesn't matter much, the laws/regulations which are enacted in the future do.

The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes.  General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.
Which I think is an overreach. So, it is not just semantics.

This will make it harder for NK to launder monies.
A simple ID requirement for accounts is not draconian, a common-sense measure to deter money laundering.  NK is right across the DMZ.

no it's trading.

No, he is trading it for a house, not trading it for fiat before buying a house. Proving bitcoins inherent value.

Turing it into fiat is selling, that's how I see it.
You don't sell a dollar bill to buy a candy bar. It's a one-way transaction. 
So if you are exchanging bitcoin for a house, you are buying the home.  The bank is selling the home for bitcoin.  In no way are you selling bitcoin.
But someone else may see bitcoin as an asset, and thus selling makes sense in that context.
Bitcoin has a dual state, both asset/currency.

And even so, your pool of suspects decreases, perhaps enough for other factors to yield actionable information. 
I have this thing about nukes, more worried about an orange fellow to be honest.
