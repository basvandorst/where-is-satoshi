Why do Americans such big troubles getting verified? Literally takes less than an hour in Europe.

He also has two feet - and that's exactly why he's a billionaire. Seriously, a person could have that exact description and be giftet a billion [money]. I'm not saying those attributes didn't make him a billionaire, but it's easy to take a billionaire, point at anything and say "and that's why".

I assume he's referring to the 200 BTC buy wall on GDAX USD

Very insightful comment. Nicely written!
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:01:24
Yup. If you have a time machine the easiest is to go back with some correct  lottery numbers.

"American stoner buddy crime comedy film".
Never heard about that genre before.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:12:10
That makes sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:01:10
Of course we can see worse. Or better. That's why its called speculation.

@_date: 2017-12-15 12:22:56
Which part of it do you consider "fake news"?
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:15:20
If you got a time machine it would by a lot easier just to go one week back with some lottery numbers for different lotteries.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:18:42
You too!
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:26:38


What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:21:10
The issue is whether we are speaking about the same thing. If I told you that you could borrow my car, and I then gave you a motorcycle because "I can call anything whatever I want because you didn't trademark it, you would not be happy.
If someone wants to buy Bitcoin and you give them Bcash, you a dishonest, because Bitcoin is something else, and you can't just change that by saying "I can call stuff what I want to call it".
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:14:03
You are correct and I was one of them until you posted, so thanks!

Only 2% can be stolen in an active hack.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:09:07
I agree, but this is the idea behind the design. Nothing is hack proof, and full security simply doesn't exist, so in practice you have to define *secure enough* and then try to implement that.
But yeah it looks like you are right about a situation where the rest of the 98% get hacked.

It literally says on their page that crypto also is.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:01:36
You are (edit: NOT) completely wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:58:19
Depends 100% on the wife in question.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:15:36
Yeah, you are right!
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:05:57
Sorry, I was wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:03:26
Yeah, check my other comments :)
Edit, I was wrong about thinking that 100% was insured.

If you have enough to sell, you can set the highest price. Why would people pay more and buy from someone else, if you are the cheapest.

And humans have had thousands of years to invent electricity and the internet. Why the fuck did they wait for so long??????

Very relevant comment!

Cool tech, cringy video.

That title sounds like a Trump tweet. SHAME! 
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:50:25
It's easy?
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:00:08
So he's the Trump of money?

Lol idk why but pre planned panic sell made me laugh. I mean, that is exactly what it is
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:06:08
Nobody knows how this will go, not even the ones who have made good money from it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:17:35
I believe that maximum is 1 year for that bot.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:47:17
Because it's easy AF.
