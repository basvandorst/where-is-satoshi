Pretty sure you can use Ether to setup such a contract ;)

Surely that can all be mostly solved by requiring, say, 5 or more exchanges. Measuring by, say, the median (removes outliers).

It could literally happen within the next hour!!! sell dollars buy USD instead

Take average of 2 or more exchanges over a 5 minute interval..

Does not mean they wont, but yeah it is less than 100% secure. Pretty sure nothing ever will be 100% secure.


Measure it over, 2 days. Then most exchanges would have to misquote for a long time for this to happen.
What system would you prefer?

Because that is the number he pulled out of his ass with little or no justification.

Sure, I thought you meant in a larger sense - Ie. The Danish stock market would massively loose volatility if it had a larger market cap or something.
Fair point on the others, good talk.

Thanks for a quality reply!

Economist here, this guy is full of shit if anyone is wondering. This is not the sort of stuff covered by economics books.

It is free for him, which is what he meant and you know it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:56:47


Why ?


Sure, but any individuals contribution to BTC is likely to be so small that it wont matter.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:16:32
You dont even seem to know the half of it, I suggest you look into the facts behind how the banks got the money to loan out (they are a front..) ... hint: It all starts in Old Old europe.. like everything else it is connected 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:12:18
Well it is a sign of increased interest from real investors, so I would say that is a positive.
However, it does not really push Bitcoin forward as a real working currency.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:15:39


You are saying that banks are directing major retailors to not accept bitcoin?.. Apple, Walmart and amazon are far too large for that sort of thing, and it sounds alot like conspiracy thinking to be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:12:46
But why not yet? obviously they have been aware of its existance for years, and if it is a better option than existing methods they should be eager to use it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:26:51
Im sure the banks are terrified
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:48:35
I honestly think moving away form a small ticker size has had more to do with it, I certainly have never heard of a similar result from the stock market.


Sure, but no developer has that much influence. If I owned 50 BTC and worked on some BTC related infrastructure then I would not be motivated by any financial gains since my own impact on the price would be extremely small.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:29:17
Well meaby but..
1. Im sure the contracts do not allow for that, so would be illegal and/or risky
2. BTC has a market cap of around 1/3 of amazon, it is hard to move it
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:12:58
If someone does not think bitcoin will continue to increase in value it is a smart bet for them.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:26:29


Well it removes the debt burden and improves exports, a drawback is it is harder to borrow in the future (amongst other things)


It really shouldnt, whoever buys debt from countries which might do it should know it is a common practice going into it. 
It is like people defaulting on their loans, yeah it is "a bad thing". On the other hand if you are selling loans at twice the risk free rate then you probably expect it to happen sometimes.
