You either lose money in transaction fees or you lose money to inflation. Pick your poison.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:16:06
Unfortunately that's just yet another poison. I'll explain why.
Bitcoin has high transaction fees because it has a large widely used network. Altcoins have low transaction fees because they are less used.
Altcoins are great! If the buyer and seller deal in the same altcoin. But which one(s?) should you own? The coin that most people will is the coin with the largest adoption and therefore safest bet but highest fees, bitcoin.
No altcoin will replace bitcoin, because the second it gets close it will run into the same scale problem bitcoin is currently in.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:40:32
Ethereum has done some good work. They're not close to visa levels, atm they're still just a crappy unscalable blockchain like the rest of them.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:44:52
Sorry but these "changes" are not technology advancements, they are simply shifts in power and priorities.
"There are altcoins that are more scalable than Bitcoin" define scalable? To me the most important metric is *users*, but there are many others: decentralization, bytes/s, development decentralization. All of these things can be weighted and shifted around but without new actual real advancements in the technology no blockchain is more scalable than any other right now, just in their own niche ways and not in others
EDIT: if you forked bitcoin and made the blocksize from 1MB-&gt;2MB you have not created anything of substance, you have simply created a coin that has no users and has different weight in priorities (in this case, less node take-up and more byte/s). These altcoins are great for exploring ideas in blockchains, but don't be fooled, they are all just as bad as bitcoin is right now.

Upvoted for Bisq.
Bisq is the best way to buy btc with fiat, I am from New Zealand.
@_date: 2019-07-21 11:49:45
Thanks for the suggestion! Pieter Wuille responded! :D
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:55:28
Ok thanks, I think I understand the issue now. It's requires a hardfork to fix, and for some reason we are allergic to hardforking. It only adds a burden to our miners, it does not affect scalability for people trying to use bitcoin as money, so we don't value it highly.

Until we have lightning routes that do depend on TCP/IP we will not have uncesorable webservices.
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:37:40
You're the one making the claim, the burden of evidence is on you. Where is your evidence that he hired someone to kill DEA agents investigating him?
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:10:54
It's three things: an application, a trading protocol, an exchange.
It does everything over tor. I have used bisq multiple times, and I have friends who I have interested to btc via bisq. It is preferable to localbitcoins because you do not have to send anything pictures of your license/passport/face etc.
But don't trust me, I recommend that you do your own independent research. There's plenty of resources out there. And the source is on github.
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:41:13
We need to be able to create payment channels and routes based on public keys alone. TCPIP is one of the largest issue of your identity. This problem is significant for "users" of a webservice, but much much more significant for hosts of anonymous services.
We also _need_ to use a blockchain based DNS. Blockchain based DNS (where names are resolved to public keys) + public key routed lightning = fully anonymized services
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:09:44
It's not perfect. It's pretty good though.
I'm not actually that well researched on tor, but what I know for sure is that although tcpip is used to _some_ degree, for obvious reasons the client cannot reference the end node (exit or internal onion address) in any message hop except for the final hop. So it's not as simple as writing a letter with a destination address on it, because if it was then it'd be obvious who you were talking with. But admittedly,  I need to do more research on the tor protocol.
Which is the issue I have with lightning today. You must make a clearnet connection with your endNode to create a route and then send your payment over that route. Imagine if you could simply write your endNode's publicKey, give that message to a peer you are directly connected to, and it somehow is eventually routed to an owner of that publicKey. That's what we should be striving for.
The problem with tcpip is that it can identify an internet connection to a small set of people.
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:00:38
Right but the whole point of having the version field is so that we can make breaking changes to the header, right? It allows us to do things like change the byte allocated to a field.
Yes my numbers were off, at 10TH/s you will need to calculate a new merkleRoot ~2300 times per second. This should be a concern though because the amount of markleRoot calculations is proportional to the hashrate, so it will continue to go up.
But to go back to my original point. The whole reason we have the nonce is for miners to change the block hash. Why is everyone ok with increasing complexity of generating a new hash, rather than extending the nonce to do what it was made to do?
Also btw, on your comment about generic CPUs being capable. For now yes, but one of the reasons BTC is great is because it's PoW is simple enough that improvements in ASICs are modest, not enormous. If we start needing to use FPGA or ASIC for merkleRoot then we raise the bar for entering mining, costing us some decentralization.
@_date: 2019-07-22 11:28:58
Yes the timestamp is why everything is measured *per second*.
64 bits is not too small. 2^64 is 19 zeroes, while a TH is 12 zeroes. 64 bits will last until we increase our hashrate by at least 6 orders of magnitude.
Just because something "has been around forever" is not a reason to keep doing things that way.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:24:08
The concern for me is that we have problem A (high fees, in this case).
If you sticky solution A to the top of the thread, you've swayed any conversation or thought for someone who may have considered a different solution.
Lightning Network is very promising. But if you promote it exclusively and disproportionality using *moderator privileges* you're actually doing yourself a disservice. Because there will be fewer alternative solutions that aren't Lightning Network to try and solve Problem A
@_date: 2019-07-22 04:10:07
Compared to generating 1 merkletree, that's still more complex.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:02:40
Another bad sticky by the mods. Why sticky this?
It isn't even on topic. You just put your own comment on a pedestal above everybody else's.
@_date: 2019-07-21 11:40:52
Yes, it is generating a new merkle tree every 2^32 hashes. But why not simply increase the nonce bit size instead of add a second method (by editing the coinbase transaction...?) to get a new hash.
Seems like we have chosen the path of more complexity, to save 32bits per block.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:30:43
Calm down buddy.
An Identity !== 1 person.
An Identity in this context is a public key. One person could hold the private key, many people could hold the private key, an automated system (AI, 0 people) could hold the private key.
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:36:02
Spender should be at the top. Holding is useless, by definition, you are not using the coin.

Hi OFrost, two things.
You said "unnecessary risk" but it's your option, and the risk is necessary in order for you to take that option. As long as the benefit outweighs the risk I don't see a problem.
Also coupling electricity to transactions is very strange as they have nothing to do with each other. Electricity consumed to ~~verify~~ discover a valid block is about miner competition. Sometimes the blocks have 0 transactions in them, sometimes the blocks are full, same electricity cost. If BTC blocks could support 10million transactions it would be the same amount of electricity per block.
I hope this was informing for you :)

I'm working on testing rust-&gt;wasm integrations in the web, so that I can run a neutrino client, and an LND client, inside an Electron App. Then that app can do things like chat with others on the app.

The question: "What is your second thought on scaling when lightning won't work out?"
Andreas Response: "Yeah! We got a BCasher in the house! Where are you?"
I think Andreas took the bait here, and handled it poorly, such that could divide the communities further. BCH is not anti-lightning. I know a lot of their trolls are anti-lightning, but the technology is not anti-lightning.
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:30:00
I recommend you research blockchain protocols, decentralization, and tradeoffs. Rather than try to claim someone is part of tribeX or tribeY. My feelings or expression has nothing to do with your inability to understand or contribute ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ sorry.
@_date: 2019-08-02 10:00:27
Technologically, they are doing things that help bitcoin. Don't be ignorant to their achievements. They're working on problems that bitcoin will run into when bitcoin increases the blocksize, and they're testing solutions for us.


Citation needed. u/memorydealers is extremely influential in the space but that's as ridiculous as saying Bitcoin is run by Bitmain.
So what if most people aren't fans of an altcoin, who cares? People are not fans of bitcoin too, should we stop believing in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-18 09:43:09
Apply your own politics to your own purchasing decisions, not others. Mining is economically driven. People should buy what makes economical sense, or they will be outcompeted.

I do follow him, I'm very educated in this space. I've never heard him say bcasher before. I agree that bitcoin development is more important for sound money than BCH development, but calling them names doesn't help anyone
@_date: 2019-08-02 10:27:11
None of what you just said has any substance, and quite frankly, is toxic. Nothing is related technology. It's somewhat conspiratorial around the local.bitcoin stuff. And it's an usVSthem mentality. 1GB blocks might be fun under some circumstances and trade-offs (like decentralization).
Every unique idea is worth considering.
The crypto ecosystem would be better off without your involvement.

Wow a bunch of downvotes, anyone care to share what I said that was wrong? Right now it just looks like people are mad because I didn't take the tribe route and say "bcash lol"
@_date: 2019-08-02 10:01:23
This is the best answer. The question was bad, and I agree that Andreas responded that way *because the question was bad*. But I'm not trying to defend the trolls here, I'm trying to defend the legitimate development going on with BCH that is not related to the anti-lightning trolls.
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:05:53
He was politely letting you know that you used "minor" incorrectly because semver is major.minor.patch, so this was not a "minor" release, it was a "patch" release.

"Piggy backing"? You think anything that is similiar is "piggy backing"?
You want only 1 type of service to exist, or any other is "piggy backing"?
I don't use and never will use local.bitcoin but it doesn't require KYC while localbitcoins does. I **have** used localbitcoins and never will again for this eason.
You would rather support a service that has KYC than a service that doesn't? You are anti crypto. Not u/deadalnix or u/memorydealers .

I 100% recommend braiins. Not only for the ASICBOOST, but also because it starts cgminer faster.
Braiins is very easy to install, you can make the s9 boot from sd card, the controlboard comes with an sd card slot, and then you change one of the electrical bridges, you will see if you research it for 10 minutes.

But you understand that different blockchains have different properties. If there are more than 1 use case for blockchain, there will be more than 1 blockchains. Because there will always be a way to configure (blocksize, cryptographic tools used) blockchains differently and _a_ configuration can be the best for _a_ use case, but _a_ configuration will never be the best for _all_ use cases.
I agree that right now the biggest use case is transfer of value. And BTC is the best at that. But stating that no other blockchain has demonstrated any usefulness is just wrong. We are learning a lot from the other blockchains.
Is Litecoin useless? Or is it a great side-by-side chain for us to see what happens if we tweek configurations, like block times? I would say that litecoin is useful.
What about Grin?
The blockchain space is new. It's healthy to keep an open mind. Yes BTC is king. Yes 99.99% of other blockchains are useless. But keep an open mind.
@_date: 2019-10-06 09:12:19

Forking BTC will essentially be killing it. The network will be disturbed and the price will plummet.
Yeah BTC is interesting because of the sha256 PoW. I'd argue that every coin that uses GPU mining except for Ethereum is vulnerable to 51% attacks by the larger Ethereum pools.
BTC PoW is sha256. sha256 is well understood and manufacturing *can* start anywhere. GPU mining is actually more centralized in the long-term because the hardware is only made by two companies, nVidia and AMD. CPU mining has the same issue with Intel and AMD.
When a new sha256 manufacturer comes into the game, bitcoin will be a lot healthier, yes.

They're still not dapps. They just use lightning for payments, which is great but it's not a dapp.
BTC maximalism is rotten. Cryptos are more like *elements* of the crypto periodic table. Each has their properties. BTC is the gold element.

Mining is centralized, China *can* get 51%. But why? The only thing that coordination would achieve would be killing their own way of making money.
100GB blockchain is ok. There is a rate of losing nodes and a rate of gaining nodes. I think we're still going up? But it's hard to verify. Nodes can be seized by governments but the nodes are spread across many countries, it would take a huge global coordinated effort on their part to have any effect node-wise on the bitcoin network.
Don't worry too much about the reward reduction for miners. If they don't make enough money they will only accept higher fees (perhaps 150+sat/byte, for example). There's going to be an equilibrium.

Nice work, you made it sound so easy, but it will not be. I don't yet understand how you transmitted data inside the lightning invoice, could you please explain that part?
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:34:54
Sending money instantly is really cool. What else can this be used for?
Does it make the usage anonymous because the invoice is routed on the lightning network?
How is the body passed inside an invoice? What is the body size limit?
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:45:50
When you send data to the server by using opennode, how is the data being sent?
Is it contained inside the invoice object somehow? 
Your examples of data being used: the user's text, the user's image
update: I've checked the opennode docs: 
Do you store json in the description field?
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:02:31
Gotcha, thanks. I wonder if there is a way for us to send lightning transactions via an API so that we don't need to run the lambda function. That would give us a fully serverless implementation. Then you are one step away from hosting a fully anonymous fullstack application. Where will the frontend live?
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:48:52
Very good. I am convinced that the lightning network will function like the tor network in terms of anonymity by using the description field, plus it has payments built in. This means that two things need to happens:
Someone needs to define a protocol of a structure similar to this
[versionCharacter, messageType, messageBody]. An example would be: `05{a:'b'}` where the version is 0 and the messageType is 5. This would allow people to send static pages over the lightning network and communicate over the network.
It's a shame that the max description size is small. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:36:34
r/bitcoin needs to stop hating people and start talking about ideas.

@_date: 2018-07-23 07:16:50
Even if every single individual human had exactly equal mining power, you could still be censored. Because if you tried to manage your own transaction you'd have to wait as many years as it takes to get a block.
So even if mining wasn't centralized, you have the same problem. Because people would pool together and then you have another group that has power over transactions.
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:14:10
It's tied to bitcoin because bitcoin is what gives it immutability.
How is tied to _a_ bitcoin? I don't think it is. It's tied to the mining decentralization and block size limit. There is 1MB of data being written every 10 minutes that *can never be deleted*. I don't think people understand just how valuable that is.
@_date: 2019-09-15 11:23:06
segwit allows for larger blocksize.
ASICs have no impact on the size of the blockchain in any way whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:34:48
Well technically nothing has intrinsic value. Things are only valuable as they are useful to individual humans. But that applies to literally everything. So anything that anyone claims that anything has "intrinsic" is wrong technically.
People will say intrinsic value when they mean utility or usefulness. I'm making the claim that bitcoin has utility and usefulness, outside of only transferring money to and from people.

I don't know if either of them are true, but your reply seems targeted at only this potentially irrelevant correlation, and not the UASF momentum correlation.
