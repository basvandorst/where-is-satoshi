BOA, if you have a direct deposit of 250 or more the service is free.
Bitcoin, if you use our service you will be charged a fee of a % of the money you are transferring, but we don't always know what that is.
See I can twist facts to suit my point too.

Won't it be 2140 when we mine the last coin?  Once we get down to visa % fees we will be good to go.

Some of the alts are gaining the same % of value or more as BTC goes up.  Some will take profits from BTC and reinvest in the alts for the next alt bull run.  It always happens.  A rising tide lifts all boats

Big selloff just hit.

10k is a psychological barrier to sellers.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:42:55
When it crashes and is still staying above 9k, I will take it.
