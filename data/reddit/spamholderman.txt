You buy 1 money X with 1 money Y. Money X becomes worth 100 money Y. Anything you can buy with money Y you can buy with money X. Why would you sell money Y for money X when you can use money Y as is?

Hah, but then the people, seeing how their cartel is violent, wouldn't give them their consumership! And then they'll form their own business or be violenced into submission, which will result in them getting violent themselves in response! Violence for everyone at a reasonable market price for your legs getting broken! Blood for the Blood God!^TM

Nope, fell all the way to despair. I missed out, by the time I will have saved up enough money to buy bitcoin, it will be way to expensive. I learned about it back in 2009, forgot until about August last year, didn't buy in, and now... Oh well, when it reaches a million per bitcoin I'll be sure to say to my children. "your dad's an idiot JimminyJamboyo"

That had to be the most eloquently put shut down I've ever read. It's comparable to Swift's Modest Proposal, without using any satire and instead just backhands the CMTA with a wet fish made of logic and elegance.

Well I'm one of those noobs, but I've stayed because when I first joined the discussion was still good and the hype didn't set in yet. And now it's back to how it was when I first found this sub. 
Hello everyone!

Wow that's double the amount I've earned using bitvisitor.
I should buy bitcoin.

Definitely agree, there's way too much speculating. Bitcoin is a currency, not a stock or investment. Just last week when I first joined, and bitcoin just hit 90 dollars for the first time, this subreddit was full of discussion and debates. Now pretty much all the posts are about the price.

Nakamoto Satoshi. 7 syllables. Illuminati. 5 syllables. 
7+5=13. 3-1=2. 
Illuminati is one word. Nakamoto Satoshi is 2 words. 
7-2 =5. 1+2=3 
There are 3 "A"s, 3 "O"s, 2 "t"s, 1 "m', and 1 "n", in Nakamoto Satoshi. 
There are 3 "I"s, 2 "l"s, 1 "m", and 1 "n" in Illuminati. 
3!!!!!!, 1, and 2 show up AGAIN!
8 consonants in Nakamoto Satoshi, 5 consonants in Illuminati. 
8-5=3!!!!!! 
There are 7(AGAIN) vowels in Nakamoto Satoshi. There are 5(AGAIN) vowels in Illuminati.
They both end in "I"s.
BITCOIN has 2 "I"s. 
Satosh"I"+ Illuminat"I"= 2"I"s!
If you rearrange the letters in Nakamoto Satoshi you get KOIN
If your rearrange the letters in Illuminati you get LIT.
LITECOIN IS THE SAME THING AS BITCOIN!
There is no "B" or "C" in either names. BC. Before Christ. 
BITCOIN WAS THE ILLUMINATI'S PLAN SINCE BEFORE JESUS!
B is the SECOND letter of the alphabet. C is the THIRD. 2 and 3 again!
There are 15 letters in Nakamoto Satoshi. There are 10 letters in Illuminati. 
15-10=5 5-2=3!!!!!!
Conclusion? ~~Half life 3 confirmed!!!!!!~~  Illuminati is Nakamoto Satoshi!
The grand daddy of all?
7+5+1+2+3+3+2+1+1+3+2+1+1+8+5+7+5+2+2+3+5=69. MY GOD.

Thanks for the answers! 
What's a mining rig?
Why isn't mining worth it?

In 11 hours we've both gained 6 upvotes. 
By using extrapolation, I predict we will soon have INFINITE upvotes!

You just need one wallet. Your single wallet can make multiple addresses, each of which can transfer coins to other addresses. If you need to make an anonymous transfer, just make a new address on your account.

Bitcoin is two things, a file that is supposed to act as a currency, and a protocol. A protocol is a computer equation that describes something. The protocol was invented by a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto.
What the Bitcoin protocol describes is a way to verify if a Bitcoin transaction occurs. How it works is the first "block" is "mined" or created from the protocol using the equation, and it grants a certain amount of Bitcoins to the "wallet" of the computer that mined that block. The wallet is what it sounds like, a code number that holds Bitcoins.
After the first block was mined, all the other Bitcoins are mined from that original block. Blocks are created every ten minutes, and by solving the block equation, the blocks are added together into a chain, and Bitcoins are given to whoever solves the block.
So back to the protocol. Every block is essentially an unbreakable code recording every single transaction and creation of a Bitcoin, and each block is made from the previous block. The difficulty of mining(solving a block) increases exponentially as the network of computing power increases(so more faster computers means harder blocks to solve) and the number of bitcoins you get from solving a block halves every few years(it started at 50 bitcoins, now it's at 25). Because all the blocks are linked together in a block-chain, it's impossible to fake bitcoins, because bitcoins not mined from blocks don't have any of the block-chain information.
And back to the wallets. The wallet is a program that holds a bunch of codes called "addresses", and you can use addresses to send bitcoins to other addresses. Your wallet can make a new address at any time, so no one knows which wallet made which payment, even though the addresses and amounts of bitcoin transferred are recorded in the block chain.
If you have any specific questions, reply to this because I suck at formatting and explaining things.

Redeem your karma from the bitcoin tipping bot!

From what I know, you get a wallet from the bitcoin [website]( or you can sign up for an online wallet from [Coinbase](
and then to mine, you download a miner like [guiminer](
However, I've been told it's better off to just buy bitcoin with fiat currency, because mining means you're given 25 bitcoins if your computer manages to solve a "block"(handed out every 10 minutes) but you're competing against computers and networks that go up to billions of computations per second, while a modern cpu only goes up to a couple million. You can also join a pool, which joins your computing power with a bunch of other computers and pays out bitcoins per share of computation power you've contributed.
Someone who knows more can correct me if I'm wrong.
