Besides, you are looking at the situation all wrong. ... Buying a more expensive machine doesn't make you any more or less entitled. To each their own. Its about ratios of the individual's net value.

**I am furious. I tried contacting Paypal two days ago and was unable to get a refund. I will try again someday.**
**People need to do something about this. I am doing my part by not sending them emails everyday. I hope to post negative things on their info till maybe a force refund.**
**BFL told me I can't get a refund b/c they are 'shipping'. Technically they are not shipping. As of right now they haven't shipped a jally since Tues Sept 3, 2013. This is fucking bullshit. What in hell are they doing over there!**
**I will devote my life to pissing off BFL**

I think that you're too well off to be giving advice. Simply by saying 'money is easy to obtain' causes me to believe so. A lot of people are struggling too much to simply disregard money.

Just called Paypal and politely told em exactly that. Was actually pretty confident something would be done. Lady there seemed pretty sympathetic about my situation but I didn't accomplish anything.
This is a very short transcript of what I said in a 20 minute conversation.
When I called she said there have been other disputes with them. I asked for a refund after telling my entire story and the tos policy.... well she said it was over 45 days from the order day and there is no buyer protection.. Said I should talk to the company and resolve it through them. Said again that I already did and they refused to refund me. She didn't know what to say... paused for a long time. Said to her what these guys are doing is criminal. Once again I said it is violating Paypals pre order policy. Stated that other people have gotten refunds even though they were over the 45 day limit. She paused. Said the same jargon again and I should talk to the bank. I politely asked her why others had Paypal act on their behalf even after 45 days. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She said she would see what she would do and put me on hold. Few minutes later she came back on the phone and said she looked into it and there was nothing she could do, again talked about the 45 day stuff
Said I should talk to my bank again. So I asked her if I talked to my bank and got a charge back, would I be in trouble with paypal. She didn't say yes or no. Just long pauses. She told me I should contact the seller again. I asked her if she could please act on on my behalf and contact the seller and help me out. That didn't work
Anyways at this point, was 20 minutes in the conversation i knew things were going in circles. I just kindly said thank you, she gave me bfls telephone number. Fuck that.
I'm not sure what charm you guys put on to get a refund but it didn't work with me. I was surprised I got nothing when some of you managed to. BTW my order was a jally on may 25th 2013. I got the upgrade a week later but don't even care about that Just want the majority of my money returned.
Should I call Paypal another time? Or just attempt a charge back through my bank. I don't want to let BFL get away with this tyranny.

**... what about vaginacoin!**
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:37:05
No i actually agree. I think what they are doing is scummy. I was wondering if there are ways to bypass it for free. I'm not attacking you. I apologize if I led you to believe i was.
However it is questionable regarding what they should do with the BTC that is just sitting there. I kinda change my mind about the customer comment I made earlier. If someone is away, perhaps not even in jail for a long period of time, maybe on tour or etc... it would be an absolute shame to come back and one's money was all gone. 
I think their policy should have some additional features to eliminate mistakes.

**Lame. This is a currency. People are not going to take it seriously with crap like this. I wouldn't have a Bitcoin background the same way I wouldn't have the Visa or Mastercard symbol as my wallpaper. Then again that is just my opinion, but fuck off if you don't like it.**

**Skill and fame doesn't mean shit to me. Those factors tend to result in close minded individuals. My money is on some autistic kid being able to crack it within seconds. Those individuals recognized for being a human calculator are not actually doing mental math. Rather their brain does the computations, they see some sort synesthesia and then just say the number that they have paired with the image. Brains are cool bro**

Yes and no. I purposely bought with Paypal b/c I know there is buyer protection. I think i'm entitled to call them and ask them for help. 
But BFL.... These guys are worse than criminals. They are the lowest form of scum. A criminal would take your money and vanish. Leaving you with despair and regret but that feeling will dissipate over time. However BFL takes your money, holds it but doesn't give it back to you. You know the money is not gone, you know who has it, but they are just dangling it in your face and laughing. They are taunting you. This is making me even more frustrated.

I'm glad you said pretty much. Raspberry Pi is quite the contrary. It's price started out small because it was designed for poor people without computers. These guys claim they like bitcoin and built this device to help it's users. I disagree... these guys like money and build this device to help themselves.

People have been trading gold for thousands of years. Money in itself was based off the amount of gold in a bank. I thought people switched b/c paper money is lighter, more accurate, and safer to use.

**Can we cut the shit. In order for bitcoin to become widestream more people have to buy it to actually use it. The more people wanting it the higher the price will be. less merchants will take it if its volatile, but if its less volatile more merchants will accept it making it's value more volatile again. Its rather a catch 22. It will eventually balance out but not anytime soon if the world is to use it. Spend it, save it, do whatever you want. Don't force people to do things. Things have a way of working out on their own**

I recently just got into software wallets. Before I would just use cold storage and imported BTC to my web wallet whenever I wanted to make a transfer. I would have multiple paper wallets with no more than a few BTC each just as a precaution. As you may imagine this is quite a pain... I refrained from software wallets b/c I was afraid that if my computer ever broke I would lose everything. 
Things are different now because I figured out how to make a paper backup of my software wallet. Now I have part of my BTC ready to be used at a moments notice. While the other part of my savings is in cold storage.

use a paper wallet. I have an okay amount of btc and hold 1 btc to each address. its troublesome but reduces risk. Never would I ever store so much money in one account. Don't buy anything, just go to bitaddress to make your wallet. I waterproofed my printout and have them stored safely. if you wanna be more secure you would have to go offline and make the wallet, but this is beyond my explanation abilities...
Most imp is to reduce risk. ill make a satoshi per wallet when the time comes if i have to.
