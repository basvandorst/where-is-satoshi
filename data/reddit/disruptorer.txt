I resent that. I recycle my garbage. This was not a recycled post. Show some manners, when speaking of original digital creations! You scoundrel!

the global finance crew wants to bring down bitcoin and they will bring down the whole house, including crypto, when they let their greed take control. there will be popular uprisings! Heads Will Roll! (as they used to say back in the bad old days).  It's going to get ugly, i am very afraid and i want to let people know there is still hope. take profits. get into something safe. prepare yourselves.  It's not just that Winter is Coming.   A crypto and economic Ice Age is coming, if we don't get out of harm's way soon enough! maybe i'm paranoid but it doesn't mean the big bag anti-crypto wolves are not out to get me!

Ooh! Yes! I do love to be included in good things! Are you coming, too? :)

Nay, nay. I am no pessimist. Me loves the bitcoin. But trading is a crazy ingredient that makes bitcoin behave much more like a hacky sack that ever before. However I, like you, and everyone, am a time traveller. It took me exactly 24 hours to get here from this time, yesterday. Just like you. Congratulations, fellow time traveller. When did you first realize you had that super power?
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:44:40
You're right! Look at that! Who knew! You're amazing!

:D So because the meme I used has typos in it, my post in invalid? That's funny. You're funny. Do you do standup? You really could. People would definitely laugh, at your total lack of any sense of humor. You're an anti-Comic. Were you born with that super power? Or did you develop it with study and practice over a long period of time? The Grinch has nothing on you. 
Have you ever seen a meme before? Typos are part of the culture. 
Peace, love and laughter!

Dollar Cost Average, which is a method of buying a fixed amount on a fixed timetable, ie: $10 worth of BTC every Friday, regardless of the price of bitcoin (BTC) on that day.

When the critic's username is "Downvoter6000" ... do you really take the criticism too seriously? :) Sounds like someone's just having fun trolling or maybe they just honestly don't know that bitcoin's value has gone up tremendously since its inception, 11 years ago.

actually if you just use Coinbase Pro instead of the regular coinbase, you can avoid fees as a market maker (setting the price yourself), or pay significantly lower fees as a market taker (buying at the market rate).

So if you haven't joined the VIP Program, it's even more than 6%? Wow. Crypto needs mass adoption. Not mass extortion. Bitcoin ATMs and other Crypto ATMs have a good use case (easy onramp for people) but those fees make it just too easy for someone to just google how to buy it for market rates or better. Then again, for average people who don't have a clue about finance, I suppose this is as good an option as any other. No thought required. Just more cost.

Indeed!  So glad someone mentioned it!  I use hashtags because they don't work on reddit.  It's just another one of my failed attempts at humor. :)

Depending on your circumstances, the opposite might also be true, yes? The more sex you have, the more gold you will get?  Be careful what you wish! Just ask the politicians who seek power, fame and glory, very few of whom ever end up righteously earning any of those things.

For sooth! Thou typeth these words with wisdom, whiteleppard. Be it knowne, that thine observational prowess is keen, adept and agile. And just as the rats fled the sinking ship, so too shall they clamor to return to its reconstituted corpus when it shall rise, yet again, from its prematurely pronounced passing, to new heights.

That said, even though the joke is revealed, I'm leaving them up in this post, or else these words would be confusing. :)
