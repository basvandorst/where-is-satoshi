Funny how Charlie Lee pulled out at the ATH right before it all went bust. Should have been a clear sign for the rest of us to follow his lead. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:25:39
TL:DR You're pulling numbers out of your butt like anyone else.

Bitcoin transactions are expensive and slow. This is a serious problem affecting adoption. This isn't FUD, its objective fact. There are other coins that handle these issues better and that poses a problem to the success of Bitcoin. Why does that offend so many on here?


I don't claim to have the solution for Bitcoin, nor is it my problem to fix.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:30:44
In that case they would be worth more. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:01:12
Because I've made good money off bitcoin. But I'm smart enough to realize that the bubble is bursting and it's time to get out. Bitcoin isn't my religion and I'm not riding this train into the ground. People here aren't being objective when they advise holding on regardless of the circumstances.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:25:35
You're not educating shit. For all you know OP could be dropping some knowledge on you right now which you're disregarding. It's easy to shout 'hodl' into the echo chamber. It's another to take off those blinders and realize Bitcoin isn't going to make us all rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:44:21
I'm glad guys like you are here to buy my coins as I take my profits and exit this sinking ship. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:33:47
Or just don't report any crypto transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:11
I've got a trezor coming in the mail today. Is it still secure to set it up on a computer that has been connected to the internet? Or do I theoretically need to purchase a new computer that hasn't ever been connected to the internet for it to be totally secure?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:11:49
Yes! We'll meme our way out of this bubble! Surely that will make us all millionaires.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:42:10
Isn't that already the case? I withdrew profits I made on Coinbase. Now I'm going to be required to pay 25% tax on those profits because the exchanges report to the IRS. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:06:13
Put it in another crypto or keep it in your pocket. I wouldn't touch BTC with a 10ft pole rn.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:02:22
Certainly could be. Anyone on here that thinks they know the future is full of shut, myself included. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:58:39
You don't know shit either. No one does. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:19:06
I thought it is only a taxable event when USD is deposited to my bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:11:21
If you think it will continue to dip and then resurface then you could always sell now and buy in at a lower price. It's really tough to time the markets, but it is an option for you. That might actually minimize some of your risk atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:19:14
So who do the transaction fees go to then if not for node providers?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:21:33
Brother, it ain't gonna pick up.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:06:27
I've never messed with a paper wallet so I can't answer that. I keep coin on my Electrum software on my computer and in my Coinbase/GDAX account. Either of those two options are just fine to store the amount of coin you hold. 
I certainly wouldn't spend the money on a Trezor/Ledger when you only hold a small amount of coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:18
Lol, well I think your dream is going to be very achievable in a couple weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:45:04
If you're smart you'd sell now and reposition at $8k if that is what you think is going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:51:26
"Even a dead cat will bounce if it drops from high enough."
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:15
Yup. Put your stop order in by Sunday night.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:11:18
I think what is stupid is those who put on their blinders and shout "hodl!" Into an echo chamber. You say it's important for one to believe in bitcoin, but bitcoin isn't santa clause and my beliefs wot make the charts go up. I'm objective when I say bitcoin is in serious trouble right now with its high fees and days worth of unverified transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:38
2.5k by Christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:08:30
How would each trade be documented or reported for tax purposes?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:56:16
Beliefs don't pay the bills. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:43
Please don’t listen to this guy. He literally has no idea what he’s talking about and probably has only been in this game the last few months if he’s making comments like this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:20:24
This comment makes me believe you're a teenager who just deposited his first $30 he  earned from flipping burgers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:15:42
You could always put a stop order if you don't feel like watching the charts. And you bring up a good point about the exchanges going down. This is the highest period of volatility in the history of bitcoin. How will the exchanges react? Personally, I don't want to find out which I why I sold. 
Edit: 32 minutes after that comment Coinbase goes down. Glad I sold when I did. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:00:44
Not this time. $10k before Nee Years. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:20:01
It's not that comparable sized dips haven't happened before, but what we're seeing today is something much different. Past dips were generated by attacks, various news stories, speculation, etc. Today we're at a point where the fees are so high that Bitcoin isnt useful as a currency. Also the mempool is so backed up that there are huge delays making bitcoin an impractical currency. I made good money on crypto, but this week i've cashed out 100%.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:07
I'm assuming another user just ordered a pizza with their credit card and sent it to his house. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:54:18
I'll bet 90% of Bitcoin holders also hold alt coins as well. Bitcoin isn't a religion. Dissent and objectivity should be encouraged here.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:11:46
Your logic is basically "We've known scaling is a problem, therefore its not a problem." "Solutions in the works" doesn't mean squat when it costs $40 to transfer Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:59:19
Except you don't know that. Bitcoin has serious problems right now which should be discussed. Bitcoiners should be objective and quit treating it like a religion. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:18:09
I'm fully in board with that, but how do I transfer my BTC to USD without paying tax?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:34:12
Dude, people finished buying gifts 2 weeks ago. This is the death spiral of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:06
This comment has aged like a fine wine. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:54
How to do you install electrum if it isn't connected to the internet?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:55:40
Except for when it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:22:32
Still you're talking out your ass. Doesn't matter if your trying to scare, encourage, discourage, inform, misinform. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:34:32
Just so I can be 10000% sure: is the electrum seed phrase all that is needed to regenerate an electrum wallet and its contents should the computer ever be destroyed?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:28:37
HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:59:29
Thats not what happened this time. BCH didn't kill Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:51:51
Made some bad trades. Lost it all. Whoops
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:34:47
If we're trading encryped currencies why would I report that I traded BTC&gt;LTC&gt;ETH&gt;XRP&gt;LTC&gt;BTC. Why not just say I held only BTC for +1 year?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:21:55
That's only one part of the clusterfuck that happened to Bitcoin this week. It's in serious trouble atm.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:41:16
0.1 Bitcoins isn't large enough to justify buying a hardware wallet. You'd be paying 10% of you investment just to have a means to hold it. I would feel comfortable keeping that amount on Coinbase or a software wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:01:18
I use it for buying steroids and other PEDs.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:03:48
Except this time it has no functionality. Fees are absurd and transactions are too slow. If this is a functional currency and not just something to speculate on then it's doing a real poor job.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:44:43
Got the same call from my dad when it was at $19k. He was right. Lost a lot of money because I didnt heed his warning. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:53:47
Where can one view these unconfirmed transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:59:36
Any theories on how this could affect bitcoin prices?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:54:55
Yup. Some of the most sound advice in this thread. Too bad it is going to be drowned out by 'hodl' memers and advice to double down. The bitcoin bubble is bursting. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:03:38
Well I don't think my little comment on Reddit is going to affect the markets too much. How do I know the hodlers aren't trying to reduce panic to drag me down with them?
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:40:47
But when you buy on coinbase you are buying at the current price. It just takes time to actually hit your account. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:26:01
I suspect an unusually high percentage of bodybuilders are familiar with bitcoin since it is used to purchase steroids online.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:44:34
So you're making $500/day on this bot?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:37:51
Where are you paying $12 transaction fees?!
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:22:59


Litecoin has a long record of stable growth and therefore has a lot more staying power than the altcoins you listed. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:03:12
Suppose I have bitcoin on coinbase and electrum before the fork. After the fork I will somehow have 2X coins. How do I access/spend the 2X coins?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:35:17
Bittrex has RSI display option
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:10:26
That is weird. I got the following email from Coinbase stating they would be crediting accounts with Segwit2X coins.






So is the Segwit2X different than the Bitcoin Gold fork?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:22:04
Thanks for the clarification. I suppose I had the two confused. Since it appears the Segwit2X has been cancelled, are there any other upcoming forks that would threaten Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:50:35
I have Electrum Wallet on my computer. If my computer dies I can just generate a new wallet with the passphrase. Right? Why couldn't you do the same?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:35:41
Aren't these exchanges online? Why can't I sell on an Indian exchange from the US?
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:25:20
Pick me please. Nice designs throughout your store. Most other bitcoin shirt makers aren't too appealing.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:05:59
What are you basing this off? Don't pretend to be some authority when you're guessing just like the rest of us.
