Thanks, guys, I changed my mind about trying to buy on MG right now. I took my bidness elsewhere.

And you cancel orders (on a whim, even if you make a mistake yourself) 4 business days after orders are placed costing clients the price fluctuation because they are unable to place the order elsewhere.
If you think you have a problem with an order, why don't you talk to the customer instead of just canceling the order. If nothing is really wrong, why don't you honor the price the order was transacted at.
You have done this to so many people and cost so much in unrealized gains I have contacted a lawyer to see if there is a class action lawsuit here. 
Still waiting to hear back, he said he'd look into it a couple days ago.

I think that's the way to go. Thanks.

And boy do they make a profit when they cancel deep in the money orders.

If it doesn't work as a currency due to volatility or government bans it will always work as a way to transfer money. Let's say it's never more than a better western union. That's ok too.

Coinbase sucks. They make an error that doesn't show for 4 days and then cancel the transaction. Apologize for it, suggest I reorder now that the price is $200 higher. I specifically wait for it to go to the price I bought it at.
Customer service takes days to respond if they respond at all.
I can wait for an alternative, I'll be first in line.

Coinbase is so unreliable. I still get mad every time I hear their name.

Hell no. Too many hacks. Too volatile.

There is no reddit, just Conde Naste

Was finally able to buy last night. I'll buy again if it crashes through $500 and settles on a lower support level.

Let them crash it, then I can buy some.
