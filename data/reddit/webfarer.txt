When you move funds to a LN supported wallet it will already have SegWit. So LN will just be a very strong driving force for more and more SegWit adoption. SegWit is already out there, and has been for a while. I already use SegWit just because I happen to like lower fees.

Now you are being biased. Insane energy costs, true. Useless? I don’t think so! Look at all the useless things humanity waste energy on. I personally think the very nature of bitcoin’s utility itself can be a driving force for cheap and renewable energy. Shutting down bitcoin (which, you will find, is next to impossible to achieve) is not going to reverse the damage we are causing every single day by burning fossil fuel on the streets. There are much much much bigger mistakes we are all collectively making that is way more devastative to the ecology. Bitcoin is nothing. You are just brain-wired to overlook the real culprits. I don’t blame you though. It is hard. I know.

I do get what you are saying. There really is no argument here. I just wanted to say that there are other cryptocurrencies that *do* have non-negligible network effects. If you are in need of a more practical crypto immediately, you can try out one that has acceptable adoption. I didn’t mean that part condescendingly. But it just is the reality.
There were myriad attempts to make an “electronic cash” that predate bitcoin. I am investing mostly my time to bitcoin for the technological marvel it is. That’s all. If bitcoin dies, another cryptocurrency will see mass adoption and face the challenge of massively scaling. I just hope that it will build on bitcoin’s promise, and be even more decentralized and censorship resistant. If that doesn’t come by, then this is a failed experiment.
In any case, there is a lot to learn from bitcoin’s story.

True. Hopefully, innovation won't stop when LN is released.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:08:30
Yea but still, I feel like the handful of powerful miners do have an unfair advantage. They can do manipulative things while still producing valid blocks. If they want to keep the network clogged can’t they just ignore segwit transactions while also benefiting from higher fees as long as they want? I am not saying that’s  what is happening now, but just that it is a possibility. We will eventually win if we outnumber the non-segwit transactions with segwit transactions (LN please...!). But still they can bottleneck as long as they can burn cash. The power dynamics is unfairly biased because they have ASIC and agenda (case in point: ASICBOOST?).
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:03:08
Scaling is not a trivial problem to solve. Any decentralized cryptocurrency is going to have scaling problems when it grows to bitcoin’s massive scale. Devs are already working on solutions, but if you happen to have a revolutionary idea for how might  one solve the problem of exponentially scaling an already massive network, you should also consider contributing.

Updates are typically done via soft forks or sometimes hard forks. The network has to agree to new rules for them to be successfully activated. Typically this is done by setting a block height deadline for miners and nodes to upgrade to new rules. If network consensus is not achieved, rules can fail to activate.

I am not an expert, but isn't a shard just a piece of the whole blockchain? Lightning, on the other hand, is not a piece of a blockchain but a separate layer that only ever settles on the blockchain. That's why validating the full blockchain is sufficient. Is there a similar validation that sufficiently validates a sharded network?

I think the idea is that a block size increase requires a hard fork, and there are many other improvements that would also require hard forking. So instead of doing dozens of separate hard forks one can batch many improvements together and do a fewer number of forks.

Hmm. I never even contemplated this possibility because I have only been using btc/usd. But this will have long term ramifications because this means soon you cannot pay cents, and bitcoin solidifies as a store of value rather than a means of payment that buys your cup of coffee. I think the divisibility of a bitcoin is somewhat arbitrarily set to a ten millionth. But maybe I am wrong.

Yes, this is a major problem as of now. Let me lay out two reasons why I think this *could* change in the future, in the order of increasing absurdity.
1.) Bitcoin is still a small fish in a big ocean. That's why its price gets kicked in every direction. To give it perspective, I don't think bitcoin will sway by 1% within a week when it hits $1,000,000 (yes, this many zeros sound ridiculous today, but I hope it gets there). 
2.) The official currency of my country is also a little volatile compared to usd. But I do not return what I buy. Why? Because I cannot do anything with USD. There's very little businesses that accept USD. But they all accept the other currency.

@_date: 2018-02-27 05:40:55
This could be total coincidence, but... in a private email to Hal Finney (which later got published) Satoshi uses a bitcoin address that starts with 1NS... He notices that NS is the same as his initials and talks about the vanity address idea for (likely) the first time. Interestingly, NS is also the initials of Nick Szabo but only in proper order. Also, Nick Szabo knew Hal Finney, and I heard that Hal Finney’s neighbor happened to be a Nakamoto. 
Satoshi said on bitcoin forum that bitcoin is an implementation of W. Dai’s “b-money” idea and Nic Szabo’s “bit gold” idea combined. He cites W. Dai in the whitepaper, but happens to forget to cite Nick Szabo.
Also, tinfoil hats look great on me.

LN is more like IOUs on steroids. You can make as much transactions as you want with your funds on LN before settling on base layer. Also these IOUs are cryptographic proof-based, so you don’t have to trust the other party, or anyone else on your reachable LN to make a transaction with them. So LN is very similar to your satoshis on a hot wallet, but much faster and cheaper to transact.

I feel like making the README.md on github more noob-friendly and resourceful, and scrapping the reliance on external websites might be a better way to do it.

Are you letting a third party control you using your money? Interesting.

If I learned one thing by telling jokes on reddit, people are dumb as fuck. Always dumb down your jokes and be explicit that you just made a joke.

Buy low sell high, and then TA if you must. Sometimes it can take years (or hours, you know) to get from your red zone to your green zone. I personally, just don’t sell for fiat.

I would link to Andreas Antonopoulos’s youtube channel or some chosen videos therein ( without hesitation.
Also a factually correct book that will get a newcomer excited about bitcoin is “The Internet of Money”.
Also would be helpful are links to reliable resources (wallets, exchanges) that do not disguise incompatible tokens as bitcoin.

I see your point. This is a very brief and quick introduction. Always keep it that way!
My suggestions :
1. A short list of dos and don’ts (never share your private key with strangers, never send your bitcoins to twitter “giveaway” scammers, etc.)
2. Links to reliable outside sources
