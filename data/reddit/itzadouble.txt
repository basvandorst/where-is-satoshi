You give Mt.Gox too much credit, they're probably yipping about the piles of cash they made and nowhere near the computer.

Yeah, I've been considering getting into bitcoin, but the price drop this morning was a bit shocking. A lot of people got 'eaten' I'm sure.  This is a cartoon I finished in about 1 hour from concept to completion. I do about every type of design including 3d, web, print, illustration. :) This is more representative of my actual illustration work:

If it wasn't clear enough, I made a gif this morning that I think illustrates it pretty well.

The problem is getting Bitcoin, the easiest way is through bank wire transfer, but there are huge bank fees associated with that. Even transfers of 100 dollars would have over 10% taken away right away, plus exchange fees of .6%, market fluctuations and no consumer protection on purchases. Essentially, there are benefits for merchants, but there is still a lot of work to do before it makes sense for the average consumer.

I hope more people will offer products and services for bit-coin soon. So many people since the media frenzy are holding bit-coin purely for speculation causing massive price instability. I'll try offering commissions in bitcoin, I hope more professionals and artists will do the same. Live free, cryptocurrency patriots. 8)
