That is not a compromise. They just want more time to entrench themselves and disable bitcoin slowly.

It also has to do with the cost of maintaining old infrastructure. The main driver in performance improvements is the decommissioning of old infrastructure. For example the largest jump from dial up to DSL occurred when dial up became more expensive, and dial up ISP's started going out of business.
Even if 8GB blocks would be too large for the internet in 2036, they can be softforked to whatever miners want.
It's just unfortunate that the core team refuses to entertain any proposals that go above the 32MB hard limit. That's not gonna be enough for any single global application. 
Even Lightning network will require 150MB blocks for bitcoin to accommodate global usage.

Did you watch the LN presentation? It clearly states that we need 135MB blocks minimum. But Adam won't go past 8MB and thats after 4 years.

No it won't. Miners will do whatever is the most profitable.

Well that's just for people, this does not include all of the use cases for the blockchain outside of people sending money to each other, such as tokens of owenership which would be much more than 4 billion, shares, smart contracts etc.
That's primarly because people see a hard limit in place. That's what is preventing Bitcoin companies from pushing for more adoption until this issue is resolved. 
I like to plan for success.

But that implementation only got ground because core devs refuse to increase the block-size for years, and they keep stalling.
They have said that there is no point in reviewing BIP101 because it will never get accepted.  They are simply against increasing the blocksize.
None of their proposals go over 32MB. What are we going to do in 5 years when everybody has at least 100Mb/sec internet? 32MB won't be enough for just one large country.

It's not patently false. None of the other proposals go over 32MB every.
One wont reach 32MB until 2030, the other one is a jump to 2MB.

What about the 32MB cap on BIP100? That's not large enough for just one large country.
What about in 5 years when most people will have 100mb/s internet and 10TB HD cost $100.

Based on standards which are available today in certain areas, which means that in 5 years they will penetrate at least 50% of the market.  Developing markets will have a faster rate of adoption as they don't have old infrastructure to replace.
Today you can get Gigabit broadband in several cities around the world today.
Trail runs of 10GB/s started a couple of weeks ago.
Singapore Trial:
United Kingdom Trial 
United States Trial
You can buy a 6TB HD today for $200

XT is about BIP101, which is the original vision of bitcoin. Not something controlled by blockstream.
You claim to be against centralization, but that's all you support.
It feels like you are the ones that are delusional for thinking that block stream wants bitcoin to workout.
FYI Maybe you have watched the LN presentation, it clearly states they need 133MB blocks for it to work.
