This comment chain was fun. I declare you, the winner. Who the fuck would spend bitcoins on food?

I told them it could be 200 dollars one day or 2. They know.

I'll start worrying about that apocalyptic dystopian bitcoin future once the Winklevoss twins are murdered.

I worry about the older ones, they'd eat that marshmallow in a heartbeat.

He's saying the same shit you're saying, just smarter and with less cringe.

Sometimes I just like to go to blockchain.info and stare at the unconfirmed transaction pool and look at all the money going through the network. Bitcoin is amazing.  
Edit: added .info

Just skimped your history, aren't you a negative nancy.

How else are you going to stay up and catch those midnight dips?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:06
Don't forget to put that tear in the pool too.

Damn, the Bcash shills are out thick today. I've always heard about them, but to see them on your own post. It's painfully obvious

I saw one that was 1200 BTC once, I wonder what that was for.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:19:41
I don't know, bitcoin is talked about A LOT.

So... If you can't properly explain yourself... I'll just write down a W for winning. Because someone with some intellect could manage to half-ass explain what themselves. But instead you decide to cop out. Whatever.

No, but I am a millennial and while the millennial struggle is typically exaggerated, I can articulate it better than you. I don't see what having children has to do with it.

I know, me too. Dad and I were waiting for a dip at 4500. When it was nearing about 7500, I couldn't take it anymore and started throwing money in.
Then it dipped

I'm hodling Tether waiting for it to take off and I still wouldn't buy bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:02:43
Still has little to do with your original post
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:07:21
... Alright, I'll give y'all that. Mentioning video games didn't help much, but in my defense, we've been off for the holidays and probably longer now because of a trucking fuck-up at work.

I just set aside an amount in my accounts that will go to them. I figure it would be cheaper to just withdraw the money when they want it rather than load them all on wallets (which they'd probably lose anyway) once the mempool goes down, or lightning network comes on I'll let them have it, but for now they can't do much but lose it. They are children after all
