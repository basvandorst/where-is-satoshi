How much are Coinbase fees? Are they flat or do they scale with your withdrawal amount?

Rather than champion the good cryptocurrencies as a whole, let's divide the community and make us all weaker. There are obviously shitcoins out there, but that doesn't mean it's Bitcoin vs. them all.

Is it possible for me to send normal Bitcoin to a lightning address? Do I need to do anything to take advantage of lightning addresses?

Lightning made you forget that having a diverse portfolio is important? Okay.

Calling all other cryptocurrencies shit is one of the reasons why crypto hasn't proliferated even further. 
Sure there are a lot of shit cryptos out there, but you can't get much more unintelligent than alienating your allies.

10% does seem like a lot. I've been working on a service where people can buy anything with crypto (usually small transactions) for 5% per transaction. Is 5% about right? [Just in case]( anyone wants to check it out.

How much was the transaction fee?

That certainly sound reasonable. Thank you!

Bitcoin was available before 2010. Not sure what they were thinking when they made this.

Heya I've been raising funds to put a Dogecoin on the moon! Even [Jackson Palmer recently got on board](

I can't imagine having 100k in crypto and not spending \~$100 on a hardware wallet.
