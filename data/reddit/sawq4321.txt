It is a poor translation because both methods are the same, something like the difference between paying with paypal at a merchant as normally done vs the merchant telling you an email and amount to send manually. I am in China and there really aren't more methods to fund than third part, instant banking and manual banking. Only manual banking remains.
@_date: 2014-04-03 10:20:40
If the tokens become worthless the network will be abandoned in time and the machines might be utilized to support other blockchains. The technology doesn't rely on a large amount of hash power since authoritative nodes can be used to prevent 51% attacks. This particular incarnation is dependent on a large amount of hash power which isn't in its favor and with concentrated power into mining pools and few large scale mining farms there is no decentralization advantage anymore.
The technology in itself is designed for keeping a ledger between dispersed entities without the need for trust and this can just as well be 50 entities in a closed network mining with an CPU with tokens representing something that isn't currency.

'wire transfer' is a poor translation, everything can still be completed online but it has to be done manually on both sides, no difference from what the other exchanges were already doing. It might be that 15th comes and goes and a month or so later the exchanges are suddenly shut down, one exhange with criminal charges in a very public way and the others finally getting the hint and shutting down within hours.

I am suggesting that a lot of people with a lot less money have problems getting their money out of gox, at least in a reasonable time, and therefore buy coins and sell them at bitstamp and other places. With upward pressure on gox and downward at other places there will be no equilibrium and the arbitrage can continue until gox get better banking arrangements in place.
I don't see any issues either regarding completing the wires. It is in the interest of all involved that this arbitrage goes on unhindered and there is nothing that indicates that gox can't access their accounts.

Not everyone wants to hold bitcoins and learn how to handle the necessary security, for an investor this is actually a good option, and the fees are not high when compared to other funds.

VISA is only a transaction system. If you use a debit card then your bank will deny the transaction if you don't have money in the account so there is no need for a fractional reserve.
Who gets the conversion fee depends on who does the conversion. If your account/card is denominated in x and you pay in y then your bank does the conversion. If the merchant offer you to pay in your currency then he is doing the conversion and it will be more expensive (which is why this is always offered at airport shops, great revenue stream).
@_date: 2013-10-20 20:34:45
There is nothing stopping VISA/MasterCard from adding another currency to their system. In all transactions it is the card issuing bank that accept or declines a transaction, so if your bank allowed btc accounts and the card networks added btc then it would work without a need for any new solutions.

You are making an assumption that the need for anonymity is so great that something like this would achieve mass adoption.
I assume most people don't care enough to be bothered by it and as bitcoin goes more mainstream that the fraction that does will get smaller and smaller. I don't hear many complain about the traceability of credit cards and even fewer who stop using them because of it.
Those who need anonymity for legal reasons should focus on a good cover story instead (before the police come knocking on the door).

The difficulty will keep increasing exponentially until the hardware meets the electricity cost, there really is no margin for anyone else to get a cut, if you believe that you can get 50 in return for 9 then you really need to read up on the network growth and potential returns.

The 50k limit has been around for many years and for most people that is enough. If you run a small business you can use your employees quota as well (not officially but few employees will say no to the request).
Swapping money, as in the article you quoted, is the best way since you can get the money the same day and at a better rate than regular banks offer.

They are the ones who need to prove themselves legit: publicly make available full identities and CV of owners, CEO, CFO and other key personnel, legal registrations, licenses and so on.
If they are not a scam they will have no problems providing this information and much more - asking for less is an invitation to scammers.

Restructure what company? It's a virtual company which makes all that a sideshow. And the total number of shares are a minimum of 25,000,000, Ken is free to release as many as he wants, he can release 10 times more after 'voting' to do so. He controls 60% of the vote - how is that difficult to understand?
He has fucked up everything from beginning until today and a retarded monkey would have a greater chance of creating an honest profitable company. Or he is not that stupid and is pulling off a good scam. Either way it is still not an investment.

It is a very special purpose fund and perhaps it shouldn't be compared with other funds at all since it only contains one instrument. For a fund where evaluation expectations of +/- 50% are reasonable in only a few months the 1.75%/year is not really significant.

It's a requirement to have less than 2%, if you have more you will eventually be closed down. Also, your break even is irrelevant, they want to hear how they make money, it starts at processing around $50k/month - below that it is not worth the bother.
@_date: 2013-07-09 11:11:26
The restructuring is totally irrelevant, how about focusing on the fundamentals instead? How about focusing on that the numbers presented was derived from what profit he wanted to lure investors/donors with? How about considering that he couldn't even put together a business plan - how will he be able to execute it? How about future dilution of shares, after share holders vote where Ken controls 60%, how do you think that will turn out?
Anyone who still believes that this is an investment and not a donation probably deserves to lose some money though.

If it was a guy on the street doing the exchange, would you trust and leave him with your money and to be on the street tomorrow when you come back, and wouldn't you like to know who he was just in case he doesn't show up? Only difference by using internet is that it is even more anonymous since you haven't even seen the guy.

It would be off chain transactions and the banks would probably run a fractional reserve but I don't see much problem with that (i.e. not more than with any other currency).
There are special regulations regarding buying currency with credit cards so it will probably never be implemented in an exchange.

You have very high thoughts about bitcoin users even though people post on reddit, if not daily then at least every week, that they have lost their coins in various ways.
Perhaps you should re brand it a bit. Launch it as a combined donation/contact method. Then people could put one address for regular donations and one with a minimum which also gives direct contact. As an example, open source program, higher donation gives you also support. It is essential then of course that the recipient can set the minimum fee.

Mining does have an indirect impact at this time. The hardware bought is expensive and to break even might need to sell the coins at twice today's price (might be on the low end for a lot of hardware bought these days) so a lot of miners will just hold the coins and limit the supply, don't underestimate humans hope for better times (i.e. higher price in this case).

That is true but that's not universally used, don't think WHM has it as default even, you really should make 2fa mandatory. Then you will also avoid people, who think passwords are reusable across sites, come crying here that you stole their coins.

So you claim that someone with IQ 70 can get equally educated as someone with IQ 130? They can both get equally good at mathematics and linguistics in same amount of time? If you really believe this then you are thoroughly delusional.
IQ is very measurable and it is not affected by parenting. If you want to look at studies then the only ones really of interest are those that involve twins separated at birth and ending up in different environments. They tend to perform equally well compared to each other instead of compared to their stepbrothers/sisters.
