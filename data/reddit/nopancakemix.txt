I would be very surprised if the price of bitcoin will not drop below 4000 dollars before the end of the month.

Hey guys I don't think it has anything to do with what you are talking about. Here's my explanation: 
Personally I don't believe the value of Bitcoin Gold will affect the value of Bitcoin itself. I think Bitcoin is a mountain that cannot be moved so quickly. It will take weeks/months for people to actually sell their Bitcoin for a better alternative. I don't believe Bitcoin Gold is a better alternative. Likely it will die, but then again: Bitcoin Cash is also still around.

Maybe you weren't, but you are replying to my comment and I am explaining my initial comment which started this thread.

Ever since we came closer to Bitcoin Gold, the entire alt coin market dropped and Bitcoin grew very fast. In other words: many people sold their alt coins for Bitcoin. Why? 2 reasons:
1. Either they believe Bitcoin Gold will be free money, by holding Bitcoin on october 24th at block 491,407.
2. They don't believe in Bitcoin Gold, but realised at least part of the market would, bought Bitcoin at a low price by selling their alt coins at a high price. Bitcoin price increases, alt coin prices decrease. They will buy back their alt coins somewhere before the hard fork. This could be hours, but most likely days (to minimize their risk). You can already see this happening today (bitcoin value declined, alt coins value increased).
So these people will have profited immensely from increasing Bitcoin price and decreased alt coin prices.
Now what do you think will happen when a decent part of the market will sell their Bitcoin and buy back into alt coins? Bitcoin price will decrease, alt coin price will rise.
People will either hop along the waves, or panic sell which means Bitcoin will drop even more. Alt coins will rise even more and then we will see a correction where Bitcoin price will increase some and alt coin prices will decrease some again.
I of course cannot guarantee this will happen, but I think this scenario is most likely.
