Well, yeah. It's our responsibility to do the right thing, which is why it is pretty embarrassing if those stats are true. However, I honestly believe it is nonsense to assume there are less idiots in Europe than the USA. I live in Denmark currently, and I assure you that idiots are idiots no matter where you are. Furthermore, being educated and being an idiot are not mutually exclusive.

Bravo.

I have so many people to thank.

Okay, and even though allegedly 25% of Americans are idiots, we still have more millionaires and billionaires, the best universities in the world, cutting edge tech, world-leading companies, and our institutions. culture, and practices influence 100% of the rest of the world.
I think we can give ourselves a pass on this one.

Okay, how about this. Bitcoin succeeded in making a currency, and Paypal failed. Success is the opposite of failure. Bam!

Marc Andreessen did not design Bitcoin. All he is interested in is making money off it. There is nothing wrong with that, however. Even if it was designed for speculations in its initial stages, that doesn't change the fact that more speculation = more volatility, and more volatility = less investors. These people are idiots looking for any excuse to rationalize their viewpoint.
Guess what? If what you were doing was going to benefit Bitcoin, it already fucking would have. Remember the November 2013 "bubble"? It started rising because there were many governments accepting that Bitcoin has a place as a currency. Then it fucking tanked because speculators saw the gains, and then swarmed in to make some quick money off it, which as per usual led to a crash.

Switzerland has a maximum federal tax rate of 13.5%, and then an additional tax whose rate depends on the canton you live in. In total, the max income tax rate varies between 19% and 46%. My family pays a bit more than that and receive shit (We are from Connecticut, though, which generally has higher taxes).

There isn't any proof except Andreessen's tweet, who wasn't even involved in creating Bitcoin. Even if it was designed for speculations, that doesn't change the fact that more speculation = more volatility, and more volatility = less investors. These people are idiots looking for any excuse to rationalize their viewpoint.

Wow. All three of the replies to this dude are on-point. has started veering left since becoming (more) mainstream, so this is nice to see.

I don't think that his recent comments contradict this statement. Just because he is personally opposed to gay-marriage, doesn't mean he would prevent its implementation... That's what libertarianism is about.
As for abortion, it comes down to whether or not you believe a fetus is a person. Abortion is at odds with the nonaggression principle in this case, considering most pregnancies aren't life-threatening and necessitate murder as self-defense. The right to life is the most fundamental liberty, and I can't see how abortion could be justified by other libertarians. The fetus is in its natural state, it is biologically a unique person, and is not aggressing upon the mother. Bodily autonomy is the only valid reason for abortion, but I consider it flawed. As a unique individual who is (usually) not posing a threat, the only justifiable option would be removing it, which is currently not possible without harming the fetus. 
So I do not think it is unreasonable for a libertarian who bases their position of nonaggression (the most common reason I've seen), to oppose abortion.
As for the free-speech thing, I really am not sure what to make of it. They were debating how best to profile potential threats, instead of just frisking any slightly brown individuals, which I think is reasonable. I'm not sure if he meant that attending these rallies is actually grounds for imprisonment, or if the people who do are the types who should be.

Not true. Look up who's more religious, liberals or conservatives, then report back. Furthermore, the purpose of separating church and state is to protect the churches from the government, more than it is the other way around. When people look first to the state and not to their faith, there is a problem.
"We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion . . . Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other." - John Adams

This is either adorably pathetic or deliciously and deviously genius. Either way, I approve.
