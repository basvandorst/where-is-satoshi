**Here's the article:**
No seriously, bear with us here...
Bitcoin just became the national currency of the tiny island Pontinha, a self-proclaimed country off the coast of Portugal.
The micronation, which is in the process of being renamed Atlantis after the mythical lost civilisation, has officially adopted bitcoin as its currency - making it “the first country in the world” to make bitcoin its official currency, as its prime minister Joby Weeks announced.
In an interview with Disruptek, Weeks also discussed the possibility of creating an e-passport and e-residency for new Pontinha citizens.
The micronation was founded by a 56-year old Portuguese art teacher who now goes by the name Prince Renato Barros. In an interview with the Guardian last year Barros said:
There are four citizens: me, my wife, my son and my daughter. I am the police, the gardener, everything.
I am whatever I want to be – that’s the dream, isn’t it? If I decide I want to have a national song, I can choose it, and I can change it any time. The same with my flag – it could be blue today, red tomorrow.
Pontinha is, shall we say, some way off yet from being accepted from the international community. But the thought experiment has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts all the same. If bitcoin were to be accepted as a currency by a more established nation, the impact would be huge, as CryptoCoinNews argues:
The tiny island could host a central bank (provided there is room to build one) where customers from all over the world could open Bitcoin accounts. Following the recent e-residency option announced by the Estonian government, the Principality of the Pontinha could offer e-residency, incorporation services and official legal status and protection to Bitcoin business worldwide.
Micronations aside, no sovereign nation has yet opted for bitcoin as a currency (although Greece at the height of this summer’s debt crisis may be the one that comes closest so far).

While consoles have exclusives (yes, I must admit that I liked TLoU), PC is:
 * customizable - you can buy a cheap PC, you can make your own one, you can choose your OS, choose if you want games from digital distribution platform (if you want one) or CDs/DVDs
 * upgradable - have an old PC? just buy new parts, you don't have to switch the whole thing
 * backwards and forwards compatible - want to run old DOS games? Here you go. Old PSX games, too.
PC also has: better graphics (at the same price point), mod support, free online gameplay (no XBL/PS+) on Steam (in some paid games you can earn money to pay the subscription [EVE]) and more games (and platform-exclusive games).
Also, games for consoles are developed on a PC.
**EDIT:** Bitcoin also was a PC exclusive (until the mobile wallets were released)!

Guys, MtGox funds were 'stolen' to destabilise the currency. It was a planned action by Federal Reserve's real owners. Bitcoin was growing and growing, they had to stop it. Our **real** government wants to kill Bitcoin, because it can't regulate it.
Also, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has made an advisory because **it was instructed to**.
BTW. No one will be charged in this case. Mark my words.

I've read the arguments from both sides and decided that BIP101 &gt; BIP100 &gt; status quo.
My anti-x arguments:
* Blockchain will get big - centralization of nodes
* No control over the block size (probably good, but doesn't sound as good)
* Miners can keep Bitcoin hostage (by using their power to make blocks as small as possible)
* Democracy never works out well (especially when it's a "special class" democracy)
* Doesn't give any control to nodes
**Anti-status quo:**
* Not very scalable
So I think that BIP101 is the best option out there.

LukeJr's UberChristianity Camp? Where decimal system is bad and you get to insert your own Bible quote into the coinbase.

It's probably the first time I'm going to agree with you, Luke.
Software patents are anti-competitive and should be not welcomed in the 21st century if we want to achieve anything.

Honestly the BIP101 supporter camp sounds way more rational than a religious dickhead who says that a ripoff of hexagonal system that no one uses is way better than everything we have currently established (decimal, hex, binary)...

As much as I support Gavin's ideas and recognize the need for bigger blocks I think that Gavin's acting crazy now.
He should get some rest and medication.
