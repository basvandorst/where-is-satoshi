Blah, so all the people who are bullish on r/bitcoin and r/ethtrader are scammers, insiders and lucky? So, I can't take their word for anything?
I'll just invest in Bitcoin and see what happens in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:43:59
You know what, I think you're right. But I did lose today on Bitcoin, I have no doubt it will return but I think I'm just panicking. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:40:42
Oh I just phrased it wrong, airplane mode is just another term for your commodity not moving either up or down until you want it to. I'm sorry if it confused people...
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:33:48
Thank you, diversifying the investment is a good idea. I'll look into Jaxx but most likely have various wallets for different currency. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:35:17
Yeah I bought late, even at $1500 and I'm losing money so I'm not sure what to do with it. I know Korea is a big player and 10am UTC is when pretty much every big currency plummets. I can't put it in something else because it's only been a few days since I started trading and still haven't figured out which currency increases while Bitcoin decreases. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:38:11
Agree, but that's not a good reason to just make graphs if it doesn't help. Half the graphs point to the moon anyway. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:33:50
$800 in 12 hours and $300 in an hour? What is going on? Is it because Korea, China, are India are sleeping?
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:46:31
What happened to all those posts about BTC reaching $3000? All those bullish posts are gone, everyone was all excited until we lost 50% of our profits. I see none of that now. If Bitcoin tops out at $2000, many people lose, but only if you bought at $2000+. You will have to sell eventually. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:32:00
Agreed, I've been watching it by the hour mostly, it doesn't look like ETH or BTC have moved at all. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:15:05
Thanks for the useless post and the down vote. "People are stupid and it's cheap" isn't the response I was looking for. ETH has an inherent purpose other than just being a currency and from the looks of it, it's not going anywhere any time soon. What happens if everything is traded through the Ethereum network?
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:15:52
I agree, you could be missing out of the time if your life, but the chances of that are much less than just looking at the trends daily, figuring out when the drops and rises are and buying and selling that way. You won't lose half your net worth, you'd lose only the fee it takes to convert BTC to USD and you'd make it back in the split second that it goes back up. From my (limited) experience, I noticed that drops happen at certain times during the day and they happen instantly while the gains happen slowly. So even if you're 5 minutes late, you can still gain. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:12:01
But isn't "Hodl'ing" keeping the money and not converting it back and forth to make more profit? I do agree that the fee is steep especially if you don't know when the high's and low's are but when you look at the trends, you can see a pattern.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:24:38
Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, ZCash, and a few others. Should I have different wallets for different currency?
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:19:58
Yes, yes and yes! While we're sleeping China, the EU, Japan and Korea are trading and you notice a dip when that happens. At least from my limited knowledge I notice dips when I'm sleeping. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:21:44
But we do know how the market will move. Trends. This is why we have graphs so we can make predictions. Economics is all about making predictions with certain levels of confidence intervals. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:05:00
Right, but wouldn't you make SIGNIFICANTLY more money if you weren't losing any in the mean time, especially half of your net worth, like today? Also, by looking at the trends, we can see that at certain times it drops and this has been very consistent. Statistically, you can infer that it would drop and you could potentially sell everyday and then buy a few minutes later when it comes back up. Because it always does. This way, you never lose money. Of course, you'd have to be monitoring it all the time or you would need a reminder on your phone when the price hits a certain point. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:06:42
On Kraken, it says the high for BTC/USD was $2589? Am I missing something because that doesn't show up on other sites. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:19:13
But if we can predict that it falls and rises at certain times, then we are sure to make profit. Like yesterday, it fell at 10 am UTC and slowly rose back up. If you looked at the trend for the past month and noticed that it falls every time at 10am UTC because China, Korea and Japan are trading, you'll definitely profit off of it.
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:11:30
Yeah, but you're sleeping when you need to sell. What do you do then? Like the dip is about to happen in an hour and I might be asleep. The price will go back up 6 hours later when I'm awake and I can put my money back in without worrying about how much I could lose when I'm sleeping, right?
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:26:24
Okay. I predict a drop in half an hour. Let's see if I'm correct. If I'm not then all of you can call me an idiot. But I've seen so many charts that drop at 6am EST that it's more probable that it drops than it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:56:19
I agree that it's just theoretical until you sell and have cash in hand. But what if you sell everyday at the peak and then buy back instantly at the drop? Instead of buying after losing $1000, you buy after losing $100 and you keep that $900 that you could have potentially lost. Or even more. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:36:49
I see. But why do you think so? I suppose that means people are buying regardless of the result? I'm iffy on buying at $1800. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:51:30
What's the price going to be today?
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:55:35
Well it dropped at around 3am just like I predicted. Not sure what that means but I've seen this happen numerous times. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:51:41
Whoever keeps down voting has some serious issues. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:05:55
No, you're not understanding. Let's say the price of Bitcoin is $2000. The price starts to decrease but you don't know how far it could go, for all you know it decreases to $1000 and you lose half your money. But here comes the part where you don't lose money. What you do is, you keep your eye on the price of Bitcoin and once it goes back up to $2000 you put your money back in. That way you're sure you won't lose anything. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:36:30
I know, but I bought now. I don't think the $80 will be a big deal in the long run now that I understand what is happening. And we can't forget about India, either. I'll probably see how it goes for the next few hours then buy again. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:29:50
It dropped by $300 last time it was denied though, from ~$1200 to ~$900. But if nobody is expecting an ETF, shouldn't people be selling and then buying again when it's low? I don't understand how the price is still so high so close to the decision deadline. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:07:52
How does this not make sense?
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:40:34
Well that's a bummer because I was hoping to buy more, I guess the time to buy would be now regardless. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:53:08
I think what I said was a mistake, but I did mean something else. Take Coinbase for example. You know that during a certain time (usually 1am - 3am PST), the price of Bitcoin falls but you don't know how much it falls. So you transfer your Bitcoin to your USD wallet and take whatever fee it may be. In other words, I would rather lose $100 than $2000 while I'm sleeping. You put an alarm on the Coinbase app that tells you the price of Bitcoin is now $1000 from $2000 and you're ready to buy. You can buy instantly because your money is in your wallet. So, you don't lose that $1000 and at 3am, you buy back in with $1900 instead of $1000. Or am I completely missing how cryptocurrency works?
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:36:31
What do you usually use? I'm thinking of just keeping my BTC in Electrum during the update, but not sure where to put my other coins. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:23:53
I mean, if we're just idiots buying out of sheer luck, then what's the point in the graphs in the first place? The graphs are there to make predictions. If we all assume we don't know how the market moves, why make graphs in the first place?
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:39:51
Okay I see. And if it's approved I'm assuming it could potentially raise to $3000?
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:14:32
That's only if the drop equals the gain. If the drop doesn't equal the gain, then you've lost. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:58:14
I just wish there was an exchange where you have a vault you can put money in without paying a fee and withdraw when it goes back up. Coinbase charges me $50 to put 1 Bitcoin in the vault.
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:56:05
I'm a student, I borrow out of necessity but I'm investing what I can afford to lose. I still don't want to lose it, though, you know? Plus I feel like this is the beginning of the digital currency revolution and I want to be a part of it. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:10:41
If you are so certain, then why did you say you can't predict how the market moves?
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:50:36

I hate never knowing lol, I feel so dumb just buying and holding like a 10 year old. It's like when your mom gives you some money to put into your bank account to accrue interest in 10 years. I don't think anyone predicted a drop by 50% but a shitload of people lost everything.  
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:30:17
The market is extremely volatile yesterday and today so I don't know if I can say the downward trend is broken just yet. ETH and BTC have been going up and down together, something else is happening that we are not aware of.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:42:41
So how low will this go? Under 2000? I'm thinking of selling and buying Golem. The price of Golem is said to double in two weeks after the update. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:19:50
Let's say you don't have that many bitcoins, you would prefer a hard fork right? But for those that are whales are invested from the beginning, they would prefer a soft fork? Where does SegWit come into play into all this? Because once SegWit is active, we'll hit the ceiling, or am I wrong on this?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:13:33
When I first read about it, people said they want SegWit and 2MB. Isn't that a soft fork? And wouldn't SegWit seriously increase the price of BTC just like it did LTC?
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:54:39
Ok it seems I need a quick and easy answer that doesn't get into all of the tech behind the soft and hard forks. First, I am under the impression that r/bitcoin wants a soft fork and r/btc wants a hard fork. I did some reading but it's quite difficult for the noob.
I am also under the impression that a soft fork would double the value of my coins giving me twice as much "money." 
And a hard fork would just split and create another chain that leaves me with two different coins (BTC and BTU) but the same amount of "money." So let's say each BTC is worth 3k now, if a soft fork happens each BTC is now worth 6K but I have the same number of coins.
I think my main issue is that I am misunderstanding what doubling coins means and halving value means.
