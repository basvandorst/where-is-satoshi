Doubt it, let's hold 13k first, that run up in 2017 was the worst thing that could happen to bitcoin

I can't lie bitcoin got me where I'm at now, but bitcoin controlling the entire market has to end in 2018, the blockchain is revolutionary and it's best use may not be a form of payment and store of value

We are seeing the last of bitcoin, hopefully it doesn't ruin crypto as a whole

Wow in what universe? Silver is cheap, at least get white gold or platinum

What is there to look forward to according to bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:30:24
It's definitely over valued
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:09:57
With bitcoin? How? And from where? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:44:25
What kind?

Bitcoin won't last 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:41:53
When's the last time you purchased something of meaning with bitcoin? You guys are too emotionally attached to this is all, there are several alts that do what bitcoin does but better, the first isn't always the last 
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:11:30
I feel you
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:04:34
The response to this guys question is the reason why bitcoin may go to 5k, this market is way too immature

The media doesn't have to, its looking pretty bad right now
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:32:37
Bitcoin is done, the hype exceeded the use case right now, the blockchain in revolutionary but the world financial systems are not going to welcome crypto currencies, the blockchain best use isn't even for currency in my opinion 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:28:00
I've been saying this since before bitcoin went crazy in 2017, it's very overvalued and now new money will be scared to enter the markets, this may be the end
