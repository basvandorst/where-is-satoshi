Thanks aha. It's weird. I can remember nearly every mathematical and physics formula I used in high school and junior college. But I cannot remember simple things

Ignore this comment. There are so many instances where debt is good.

I cannot even remember my phone number. I have tried to memorize it, but to no avail

It's not high end economics. Depending on how your government taxes income and capital growth, negative gearing let's you borrow money to buy another house and you will make money. Similarly with other capital growth investments where you can deduct your losses on your taxes and then make money when the capital grows.
It's not high economics, it's investing for the future.

It's gone, sorry buddy...

Stfu, you're talking nonsense. That's what you don't understand. CURRENCY IS WORTHLESS. ALL CURRENCY IS WORTHLESS. It is just a means to an end for efficient trading. It is too hard to trade a goat for a hamburger, so we have a piece of paper with written value. Legit the same as bitcoin. You have 0 idea how an economy works. All economies around the world who save DO NOT grow. Profits need to be reinvested. That's why governments don't "save" money when they are in debt; because it doesn't grow the fucking economy. Instead, they borrow money in order to create jobs and growth. All of this borrowing spending etc inflates the dollar. If none of this happens, you're fucked, you get 0 growth. Governments have been doing this for over a 100 years. 
This is terrible post by OP. Anyone who has majored in economics/works in senior positions in government (I have previously myself) knows deflation is bad for a currency. Period.

Literally half the redditors on this sub have no idea why it's bad to have a deflating currency that is used to buy everyday goods and services. 
*Edit: My wording
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:33:34
Exactly, you will hold it. It is a currency not an investment. Want something to hodl? By a house, a business, not cash..

Or until the oil runs out. Usd is pegged against oil prices. Too many countries use it. It's pretty much like a bank, too big to fail.

You have no idea of how an economy works. Just watch a 10 minute video and that should give you an idea. A currency is supposed to be a tool to trade for goods and services, not an investment. If it is used to just hodl, your economy will not grow. When a business turns over 1 million in profit, they will just hodl the cash because they make more off hodling than reinvesting it. That is how an economy goes down. That money needs to be reinvested (more jobs and growth).

It's because bcash is trying to look like bitcoin to piggyback off of their success. Any new user of crypto will get confused between the two. It's like me saying I'm making a new forum called "Reddit Reader". I'm just piggybacking off of reddit's success to try and grow my own forum. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:08:22
lmao. Firstly, where you're just getting into crypto it is very daunting. There are prices every where green and red. It's not as simple for a new user to understand two different prices to completely different coins. Also, someone new might think that bcash is owned by bitcoin or bcash supplements bitcoin, something of sorts.
Originally before I understood forks, I thought bitcoin cash and bitcoin were 2 different chains but can be transferable (as in bcash can go to a bitcoin public address). Only after hours of research I understood what bcash and forks are. 
tl;dr They have the same name. If 2 businesses have the same name you would think they are affiliated. I.e. Samsung 8 and a Samsung tablet have the same name = same owner. Bitcoin cash (bcash) and bitcoin, same name (don't pull the bullshit of well it has cash. No it has bitcoin in the name). So therefore we call it bcash to stop the confusion. It is self explanatory. You are pretty brainless if you don't understand this simple issue.
EDIT: typo's 
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:25:14
Well yes, but you shouldn't NEED to do hours of research to understand the difference between the 2. If bitcoin cash was simply called bcash on all exchanges, there would be 0 issue. And saying large quantities isn't objective enough because large to someone might not be for someone else. Someone might chuck $100 on btc and $100 on bch because they think they are affiliated. $200 might be a lot for someone else but not for that specific buyer. It's just common sense to have the name bcash on all exchanges.
