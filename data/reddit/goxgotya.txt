okay you're right then heading for zero then? i guess time will only tell who is right. There's many other facets to what is going on right now. If you're so confident you're always welcome to put money against it

we're in the process now.... a lot of people bought in when it went up to 600 to 1200, and then alot of people bought in between and in the dips in hopes that it would go right back up (hoping to be greedy) everything is getting to a settling point now. Things take time and people lose patience and are afraid to lose their investment when they buy around lets say 700-800$ being average and then they see it going towards 450 and maybe even lower.
Turn arounds don't happen over night

Not if there are more people selling then buying at the moment. Simple economics

Yeah, to people who may probably never have invested in their life... look at the target demographic of people that had it / bought it during the hype. Now a lot more people know about it while its reaching a more reasonable buy in price with much more of an infrastructure behind it then never before, I don't really think you know what you are talking about and just want to hate on it regardless of what you hear. How much money did you lose?

the more widespread it is means vendors can soon have the option to pay their vendors for cost of goods with bitcoin. The more its used and more exposure, the better. like i said im not waiting to flip 100, 1000, or 10000 dollars a night . but i'm sure if you let it build , it defiantly will improve.  Right now there are just too many way optimistic,too many way to afraid jumping ship, not a real good amount of cypto financialy savvy people, and too many ready and willing to shit on everyone's optimism and troll up the internet. Unfortunately this place has becoming more and more like a circle jerk. Would be better if it got back to more serious articles and questions how to use / improve bitcoin, but things happen in cycles.
It's very illogical to tell anyone that it's 100% going down is the bottom line, as it is if you were saying it's going 100% up. However, everyone that comes and fags up the forums by trolling and shitting on all the news doesn't prove any argument what so ever. There are a lot of things I can point to that show there is a lot of money and pretty smart minds being put in to the system regardless of what is happening at the moment.  
Crypto-currency has been invented, and it can't be un-invented.

No, you obviously have nothing better to do than stick around the community and try to engage in flame conversations for half an hour. 
There's nothing left to say, you can't really speak to say it positively won't go up either in the future either (Future does not mean 1 month , 1 QTR from now - somethings are more long term), so besides you starting a back and forth, pointless, argument and trying to look like an intellectual asshole, why don't we just see what happens. You can voice your concern or remark if you still have any at that time. Unless you can accurately tell me why the price is swinging and where it will exactly land, I'll catch ya in a year

My take on it is a lot of the people who bought in the bubble are panicking, and cutting their loses. But there's a new part the puzzle now. The infrastructure of bitcoin, the community, and vendors that accept the virtual currency is more built and stronger than it probably has been in forever. 
I think once the speculators flush themselves out of the market, the early adopters and smart money investors will settle in and the price will be driven up again, perhaps in a new even larger bubble. Patience is the real key at this point, just relax and enjoy the ride and appreciate the fact you are part of a grand experiment to have the option to have the power of money being given back to the people 
When everyone is fearful and there is blood on the streets, that is the time to buy and rebuild

I read an article that told of a guy who purchased $13k worth of bitcoin using his credit card.
He said his method was to use coinbase.com and set up your credit card as it ask for a "backup" method. Then purchase bitcoin when purposely overdrawing your account. your bank should block the transaction and it will use your credit card to purchase it as back up. 
Haven't verified this myself, but seems pretty plausible. I believe the guy said you can be subject to an overdraw fee depending on which bank you use, but he was willing to pay that 20 to 30 dollar fee in order to use his credit card to purchase.
