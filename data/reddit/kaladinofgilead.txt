It doesn't matter if you're buying a coffee or a house when it takes time measured in hours to confirm the transaction and absolutely massive fees.
Bitcoin isn't even the best cryptotech out there right now. Ethereum is easier to use, faster and cheaper than bitcoin.
We're trying to make a tech better than what we have. When you yell at people and say "YOU IDIOTS ARE USING IT WRONG, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SPEND MONEY ON COFFEE EVEN THOUGH EXISTING CURRENCY CAN DO THAT" you just come off as insecure.
Bitcoin has its faults, you need to admit that instead of moving the fucking goalposts.

You set up a crypto mining and a trading bot...but don’t know what RDP, SSH or hell even chrome Remote Desktop are?
It just doesn’t seem likely

So there are fee’s, op is just lying about when they happened.

Some cases with Windows look nice, others look like some Mountain Dew chugging shit.
If you want a case that doesn’t have a window, fractal design cases have that option.

I just ran into this as well -_-
I bought $20 in coins from coinbase but found out after that you can't sell on coinbase if you're in canada.
I transferred my $20 in ether off of it for 50c though which is sick.

Ethereum wasn't built to just be a currency thing. Cryptokitties is a valid use case for ether.

I'm brand new to crypto, before buying any of this stuff I only knew about Bitcoin and Ethereum (and only because a friend told me about it like a year ago and sang it's praises).
I bought $20 worth of Bitcoin and the fucking fee to send it is $30.
I bought $20 worth of ETH and the fee was .50c to send it.
I litterally just spend $20 on something that can't even do the job it's designed for.
Ether might now be perfect, but holy fuck is it night and day compared to Bitcoin. Shit ain't even a competition.
