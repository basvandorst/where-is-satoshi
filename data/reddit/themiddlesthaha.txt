My funds were substantial. Damn auto correct

But that's super risky, how many people can lend out 500k+ to an individual for a mortgage? A certain amount of are going to default. So inherently the interest rate will be very high as well, as lenders will be in short supply. 
It's very clear a large institution could come in and swallow the massive individual risk and hence offer lower interest rates. And they'd immediately dominate the market. This is basically what a bank does today.

In terms of our engineering priorities, securely storing customer funds remains our top priority. Our next priority is to ensure that our platform remains performant during periods of peak volume. Following security and performance, we are focused on adding new features for our customers.
Many of our customers have been asking for SegWit, and we’re working out a way to implement this upgrade safely. We store billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on behalf of customers and any change to our infrastructure is done with significant planning and consideration for the security and stability of our platform.
TlDR: We are prioritizing security and performance over new features

The money supply is defined as deposits + coins. So peer to peer still increases the money supply. They have a credit for their Bitcoin while it's still circulating.  That website is creating Bitcoin out of nothing according to you

BitBond.com has loaned out thousands of bitcoins. The money supply of Bitcoins is greater than the number of Bitcoins mined. I guess Bitcoin is a hoax too
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:55:04
No they do not. If a bank has $0 dollars on hand, you cannot get a loan. In order to get a loan, the bank has to have someone deposit that money first. It cannot come out of nowhere. This is what made the crash in 2008 so bad, banks couldn't issue any mortgages because they had no money. This further drove down the value of houses exacerbating the problem. 
What you are referring to is the money supply, which is defined as money+ deposits. Which... Of course banks increase the money supply. If you lend me $20, and I lend $20 to spez, did we create any money out of thin air? Of course not. We did increase the money supply though. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:48:50
And any check, you can take to a bank and redeem for cash &gt;&lt;

@_date: 2018-01-06 02:48:51
Lol the average house in the United States costs over $200,000. The average new vehicle price is $35,000. 
Almost no one is going to be able to buy both of those straight. It's just foolish. If people could buy the house straight, then the price would increase, because there would be someone willing to take out a small loan on top of the cash they had to get the house.

How? I got a auto loan for $20,000, the seller left with $20,000 in his hand. Where did that money come from?
What you're referring to being created out of thin air is the Money Supply, which is defined as money+deposits. Obviously banks can increase the money supply. Any time you deposit money in your bank, the money you deposited still exists and your depsosits increased.
 If you loan me $20, and I loan $20, did I create money out of nothing? No. We did increase the money supply though.

Literally every single one of those links is talking about the Money Supply, which first depends on a deposit. It is not "from nothing". 
Money Supply defined as money+deposits. And again, very obviously banks can increase the money supply. 
Do we need to go over the $20 example again?
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:25:58

It's not the processing power, it's the memory and bandwith. It used to be you could run a full node on 64GB sd card, now you need at least a 250GB harddrive. My data limit from Cox is 600GB/month so it'd take almost half my monthly data just to download the block chain(imagine if the block chain was 8x larger, it'd take 4 months of maxing data to download). But besides that, if you set up a node, it takes a long ass time just to download the chain to even get started.

A bank cannot lend out money it doesn't have.

We can do an example. I will lend you a $20 and then you can lend that $20 to Notice how first we had to have $20. 
Now did we create any money? No, we used the same $20. I cant spend any of my $20 you owe me, unless you get the $20 back from and give me some or all of it.
However the money supply increase by $20. Money supply is defined as cash +deposits.  This of course, couldn't have been possible if we didn't have $20 to start with. You would have had nothing to give @_date: 2017-12-17 21:48:40
Do you cover the fee?
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:53:31
This is similarly true of bitcoin. The Bitcoin supply is higher than the number of bit coins, because the definition includes bitcoins + Bitcoin deposits.
Notice for bitbond to increase the supply of bitcoins, someone has to have an initial Bitcoin to lend(make a deposit) before bitbond can lend out the Bitcoin to a borrower. This the money supply increases by the deposit+ the one Bitcoin still in circulation. No bitcoins are created in this process.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:02:31
Where did the $10,000 come from? You said the bank doesn't have $10,000. So they couldn't give it to you. 
The bank cannot print money, so it couldn't create it. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:26:21
How did I get that money out of the ATM if the bank didn't have $10,000?
If this is how you think banks work, I'd highly suggest you look up the requirements for starting a bank. Banks cannot create money out of nothing. They can increase the money supply, but the money supply is not the same thing as money. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:46:00
Your first sentence makes no sense
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:19:00
What are these magic numbers? 
Some banks are very small. You only need a few Million USD to start a bank. 
And even large banks don't always have $10,000. Part of what made the housing collapse worse in 2008, was that even people that wanted to buy a house couldn't get approved for a mortgage because banks didn't have money to give out for mortgages. I feel you were not old enough to try to buy a house 10 years ago but it was frustratinf trying to get a mortgage.
I like how you keep assuming the banks have the deposits to issue loans, even though your post explicitly states they don't have the money to issue loans.

That's different than what you typed, and different than creating something from nothing(it first needed those deposits). 
If a bank doesn't have $10,000 then how can it give out a $10,000 loan?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:53:49

@_date: 2017-12-28 22:47:46
I know what fractional reserve is. To issue a loan the bank has to have that money on hand to lend out. It'd be pretty horrible if you got a mortgage and the bank didn't give you the money to actually buy the house. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:05:33
Isn't bch more like the Bitcoin white paper than BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:58:06
A real example would be a debt transaction where the money is deducted and transferred instantly.

"Also a bank can create "money from nothing" because of fractional reserve banking: The bank can lend money it doesn't have, needing only a fraction in reserves. That's what's known as "fiat money" and this has its own risks."

How do you know? Small businesses don't start with infinite amounts of capital.
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:16:44
You should be stickied at the top of this post.
Lol at op

He is defining a hack as finding a collision on the hashing function 
@_date: 2018-05-21 23:50:12
Okay? What about it?
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:55:47
So in your comment. They would have one mining machine and it would probably take 1-2 years to recoup their investment
This company probably has thousands of them right now. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 23:03:43
I didn't buy any, but its clear they couldn't have afforded all their machines with their starting capital. Which is why they sell their products
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:51:28
I'm not sure what you're even saying anymore. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:10:06
How are those not a hack? 
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:12:58
One where they need capital to purchase the machine. 
That's like capitalism 101
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:23:52
Yes. The only way they can lend out money is if someone already has deposited money. They cannot lend out money they don't have. 
Have you ever gotten a loan? 
You say 'a bank can lend out money it doesn't have' which makes me think that you need to read that article. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 05:35:37
Or 20k was an absurd price 
@_date: 2018-10-12 05:37:37
Have you ever used it besides holding?
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:36:45
Yeah but no one buys the motorcycle, would what do you think happens to the company that makes motorcycles?
All of a sudden no one even makes motorcycles. So you can't even buy one if you wanted to.
In deflation, economic activity grinds to a halt. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:55:00
Where'd you go mate. Why wouldn't you feel comfortable making .16BTC payments every month for 30 years for a house worth $350,000?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:26:51
Have you ever bought anything with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:04:17
What's should the actual value be right now?
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:23:19
What do you actually think the value is? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:33:11
Yeah. The most famous period of deflation in US history occurred during the great depression, which is a time famous for people's purchase of consumer goods.... Oh no, it's not. 
There's plenty of sources on deflation. You can do a cursory google search.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:35:39
That doesn't make much sense
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:33:33
Yeah so the food truck becomes more expensive, I covered that :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:33:15
Yes. It's a way to make transactions. Can you read?
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:33:55
Isn't that like most the people in this sub? Sure there's some people who use BC to purchase things, but how many people on here just think of it as investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:33:06
I'm older than you. What a dumb little shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:24:12
Ah yes. The North Korean economy model.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:09:40
Sounds like if a lot of people have no idea what something is worth, yet keep throwing money at it, then that's a definition of a bubble :/
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:05:13
Again, why on Earth would you buy a stock if you knew it would be cheaper tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:40:41
Why would you ever buy a stock if you can buy more if it tomorrow? If the seller of the stock can't find a buyer, what happens to the stock price?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:26:28
Taxable income isn't the same as capital gains from the sale of BC
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:42:31
Why is that? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:43:58
I know. I asked what you think the value is. If it was 15,000 would you sell? 20,000? What do you think the value is
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:18:32
Central banks don't allow it to happen for very good reasons. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:51:02
Have you ever bought something large with Bitcoin like a car or house?
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:45:59
LCK was having people watch him masterbate before he was famous. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:43:09
So it's a currency that's not supposed to be used other than to store value? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:23:31
It ignores the fact that thousands of digital currency's have flopped.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:19:34
Why is Bitcoin at 10k if you can't use it?
You're seeing more people sell because they're getting out before they're left holding the bag. These people never wanted to use it like a digital currency or anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:51:37
Yes I did? What a horrible comment. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:13:17
Isn't the reward sent to a pool and then the pool divides it up? I guess you could follow that trail but seems a lot of effort.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:32:06
Yeah just thought I'd differentiate between the two. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:30:11
This is actually really cool. I hosted 20 airbnbs at my condo earlier this year before my living situation changed and Airbnb butt fucks everyone so hard in fees. It's nuts. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:56:16
Bunch of kids that have never read an econ book or taken any schooling on it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:57:08
That's literally taken out of a scam artist or con artists play book lol
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:15:59
Why do you think Bitcoin is worth that much? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:04:52
I don't know anyone, even the people who have bitcoins, that use them for transactions. Like all the posts on here, that this original post was about, and even you said, they invest them. But no one actually uses it. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:22:05
Yep, that was my initial thought too. I was just seeing the thought process behind someone so adamant about it, and it didn't inspire any confidence. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:50:29
How do you know the miners have a lot of coins?
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:04:39
That's not the problem. It's that small transactions can take a long time to process unless you put relatively large fees on them. So a taco truck would need to raise taco prices high. Or risk that the payment is fraudulent. Or provide exceptionally slow service. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:10:32
What do you think you'd be going through if you had bought a new car for 55BTC at the start of the year and owed a .5BTC payment every month?
Do you think you'd buy, let's say a $350k house, today, for 50 BTC today, with a monthly payment of .16BTC for 30 years?
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:20:25
What do you think it will be worth in 1,000 years? 1,000,000 years? 1 billion years? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:41:39
Would you purchase a house today in Bitcoin. Usually with houses you put 20% down and finance the rest over 30 years.so let's say your monthly payment was .16BTC. would you purchase the house? Why or why not?
(What's really funny is since I've asked you this the other day when it was 7,000$, and now it's 8,000, the monthly payment is already 14% more expensive)
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:46:47
Imagine you have two credit cards. When you pay with one, it approves in a few seconds and only costs a few pennies. When you pay with the other it takes hours and costs $5.
Which one are you going to use? Demand for the faster and cheaper one leads to a price increase.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:41:46
There are many of those tho. And they're all exceptionally risky, which is the opposite of what you want in a savings lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:43:32
They would if they didn't have the capital to buy the mining machine to start. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:32:20
Where'd you go?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:46:56
Why would a merchant save money in BC? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:19:16
You're saying when demand goes down the price doesn't go down? How absurd. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:55:26
Yep exactly. It's useless except hodling 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:42:03
How do you valuate it exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:59:19
Absolutely nothing. It's awful for an economy. 
Why would you ever buy a motorcycle when you could wait 2 weeks and buy 2 motorcycles? 
What if no one ever spent money at your business?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:49:01
Not the way it works. The more hash power, the harder the problem is, and longer it takes to solve. You can't speed anything up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:05:14
Is it? Or is it a way to make transactions, trading one good for another?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:13:18
That's because gold has uses
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:24:53
He's hoping to get more people to buy to pump up the price. It's basically a scam post 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:23:51
That's the problem with hodlers is they have no clue what it's worth. Some legitimately think it's worth $1Mil. And the ones that think it's worth something can't tell you why it's worth whatever they value it at. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:48:23
You can look at these peoples posts. They literally only bought to hodl and sell. They never we're into any other part, and now that they've taken someone else's money, they're done with it and will use USD for everything. They couldn't care less about having a virtual currency that's useable. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:11:22
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:52:08
There is 100% chance it will go to 0 at some point. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:58:56
What exactly makes you believe it's worth 10,000?
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:56:30
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:40:52
Think about what the network and activity would be if 2 people had all the bitcoins and you had a final one. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:04:35
It's literally why the fed targets 1-2% inflation. An economy grinds to a halt with deflation
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:02:02
Every large bank in the US could easily buy every single Bitcoin. Even in the future if everyone switched from USD to bitcoins, people would still need banks.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:04:09
He has no clue. He would say it's undervalued at 50k
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:49:56
Yeah that's what I meant, we should be cheering on the entire crypto community to drive it down. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:21:33
Bad guys have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:55:16
The 2 richest men in the world could buy every Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:56:54
It also clearly ignores the main criticism of volatility lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:14:21
Sure. Who's going to sell/buy something only 2 men can use?
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:26:37
Why does bitcoin deflate?
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:21:33
If you had the last one, it would be worthless. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:31:35
Everytime you run your Visa, 3% is going right to the CEO's bank account. It is a bunch of garbage. We should all be rooting for the entire crypto scene to drive these fees down.
