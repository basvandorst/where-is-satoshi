Exactly, so to clarify what you're saying is that bitcoin is in fact more deflationary because the supply is more abruptly limited than that of gold, which backs up my original point.

See my comment above where I absolutely DESTROYED that guy.

No, by my logic everyone will continue to use currency as they are, while using bitcoin as an investment tool to make money in the frenzy stage as well as to hedge against inflation, as they have done with gold and silver all this time.
By your logic nobody would use currency and just put everything they own in investments. Oh but wait, they don't do that because they need to use the currency to, you know, *live*. It's good you kept your comment short, saves you the embarrassment of being shown to be wrong and uninformed, unlike the guy below who got absolutely DESTROYED.

It's like a see-saw or balancing scale of supply and demand. Demand will fluctuate due to market forces - right now demand is high for bitcoin. Because supply remains the same, demand outstrips supply, so the see-saw goes down in favour of demand while supply is lighter. This translates to price going up. If supply isn't fixed though, for instance if the central bank increases supply to match demand, then the see-saw remains in balance and the price stays relatively similar. 
Price = demand÷supply
Yeah cryptos with inflationary dynamics built in are much more likely to become mainstream imo. My money's on etherium long term. My comment above was inaccurate lumping all cryptos as deflationary

cryptos are deflationary because they have limited supply, same as gold. so they'll never be used as a currency due to price instability. enjoy the ride but know when to get off.

Might as well remortgage the house and put it all on bitcoin, after all it's just wasted sitting there keeping that roof over your head when it could be making you money.

Yes and Japans economy has suffered immensely due to the deflation. As you said, the 1930's depression was caused entirely by deflation, as the whole economy seizes up when currency doesn't flow. It's in the name - currency - there has to be a steady current otherwise it doesn't work. The entire electronics industry has been operating within economies that are inflationary because they use fiat currencies. To use that as some kind of comparison is crazy because you're comparing an industry to the economy it operates within - like comparing a car engine to the car itself. Also the electronics industry isn't deflationary - things get smaller and cheaper, so it's inflationary because if you just accumulate and hold electronic gadgets they will lose value as time goes by - which is exactly the same as fiat currency. So you're wrong on pretty much every level, which I think is hilarious. Lastly, isn't it funny how the same people who say bitcoin will take over as a global currency are still counting their profits in USD? Makes me chuckle every time. And no, I'm not butthurt from missing the ride because I'm on the ride, just making the point that bitcoin will never be a usable mainstream currency.

It will never be used as currency because of limited supply everyone will end up hording and it will always be deflationary.
