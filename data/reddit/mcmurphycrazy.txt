Huh. I trip regularly and have no clue why I haven't made this connection before. I like these guys.

Holy shit the sound of this was really great.

I just bought my first $25 USD of BTC today, and plan to buy about the same amount every two weeks. Figure why not, could pay off massively in 5-10 years.

I bought 0.04 BTC just two days ago and waiting on them to arrive on Tuesday. So excited! I figure why not use it as a sort of savings account and put a good $25 a paycheck into it that may pay off big in a few years. If it crashes out and isn't worth shit, oh well. I lost the equivalent of one good meal a month. No big.

I bank with Chase and have been dreading to see this kind of news. Looks like I'll finally be moving all my banking to a credit union like I've been wanting to, just been too lazy to do so.

Yep.  I subscribed after seeing it and now am seriously thinking about investing small amounts of money into bitcoin a month.

I was hoping thered be a big ass crash so I could buy up more. I was tempted when I saw it in the 900s to throw another $20 at coin base but figured it wasn't THAT big of a difference

I'm buying through coinbase.  I don't really know of a better/safer way to buy.  I tried signing up for mtgox but after a week of submitting my info they still hadn't approved me and BTC value was skyrocketing.

I bought in with $24 for 0.04 BTC a few days ago.  Figured let's jump on this train before it gets too ridiculous.

You have to scan the printed out PDF for mtgox to accept? Fuck maybe that's why after two weeks they still hadnt verified me. I just sent them the PDF from AT&amp;T

Very interesting. I'm going to start investing a small amount of money per month...like $50 or less that won't hurt me and see if it pays off down the road.
