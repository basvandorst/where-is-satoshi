In this recent slump, I am sure all  giant dictating businesses may have realized that they better support BTC because of it goes down, their alt business goes down the drain and even deeply. So now I have high hope that segwit and batching will soon be adapted faster and faster. I already see mempool clearing.

Correct. But they hate bitcoin. Notice Brian's ( Coinbase CEO) recent tweets against bitcoin when they were exposed due to UTXO locked funds. They are favoring BCH and others more. Promising on segwit for more than a year with zero progress. I even tweet Brian every now and then asking for it.

This is the game of surprise whale attack. There is no money in following TA for whales who can move the market. They do the exact opposite. Tone is a trader so he talks TA. Try to do the opposite next time but only when the price is right. Think the big picture. YOU WILL WIN.

That will never happen mathematically. Blocks will still be found every ten minutes but Because block reward halves every 4 years approximately, the miner's motivation to keep the network running will be the tx fees at that time, not coin reward itself assuming coin price does not shoot up enough by then.

If I understand it correctly. Shape shift has just blocked their addresses for further transactions. Thieves probably already have their private keys for money in Monero and bitcoin. I don't think they are fools to leave them on angry exchange! Someone correct me if I am wrong.

It's a global currency I am not dependent on any third party to use the currency that I own and earned. I can buy from anyone in the world.
I am sorry to say took need to learn more about bitcoin and cryptos. It seems there is a lot in the tech that you probably are not aware of.

This is just about adaptation. Once it's adapted properly, it will be stable. Bitcoin is the most HONEST currency man has ever created, that is why I have full faith. Once China crises is over, you will see it reaching heights it never reached before. That is what bitcoin has always done. Try and not invest in it, I bet you will regret one day.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:39:31
Very Correct. Actually I can't believe people back then were so ignorant that they couldn't think about these problems with tulips.

I didn't mean to be harsh. Just wanted to be a little stern to make newcomers(and even HODLers) realize that HODL ing may also not be necessarily the best strategy in this world where prices are easily manipulated by anyone big enough who is paid to comment against bitcoin. I disagree with its trading being different. It is almost the same. Most Technical Analysis rules apply here as well. They follow the timezones also. Yes exchanges are open all the time. And major market manipulating forces do exist, which are known as whales. These are people with huge amount of coins and trade in groups to manipulate prices, this is also the reason why we HODLers have not seen 6k yet.

@_date: 2017-10-09 04:07:15
Welcome to Reddit
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:01:35
Because of no replay protection in Segwit2x fork. Which means no one is getting extra coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:37:35
But because of 51% rule and possibility of attack on each other, only one would survive
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:16:51
Once we all thought credit bureau can never get hacked. BTC can almost not get hacked for a longer time due to its blockchain based design but Exchanges, oh boy. Websites, for sure yes. Mobile based 2FA  - ask Verizon. All  companies are vulnerable.
Disclaimer: I am in core IT in a big company and I know how less than 5% of revenue is spent on IT. The rest is spent in paying CEOs,  executives (who have no clue how staff managers are showing them rosy picture that everything is fine) board of directors, lawyers, overpaid vendors, politicians donations (most likely), bad decisions, law suits.

Personally, I only regret not mining bitcoin in early 2011-2016 when it was so easy to mine and I knew about it but like many others, didn't believe it will go so high. The worst thing is that I have kept my computers, laptops always on and have several rented servers for years!

I am no developer( still doing my research on latest news) but my theory is that this fork is very risky and for that reason price will go down even more after bitcoin gold fork.

We are not taking about bitcoin gold. We are talking about segwit2x fork.

You don't check it in school??
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:48:15
Agreed. I was saying that most likely only one coin will survive since it appears segwit2x has majority of miner support and some exchanges like Coinbase which want to label segwit2x as bitcoin. So those may not support bitcoin. Some have said they will support majority. All this makes me feel this might not be a split worthwhile plotting for extra coins. People will worry more about protecting funds instead.   
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:43:51
They are doing this deliberately, knowingly. True example of fake news

What ignorant people people like you don't know if that What you get from credit card back is just a tiny fraction of money you already paid as fees indirectly because the merchant was charged buy bank huge. Imagine what the process will be of your merchant did not have to deal with these expensive banks. Your great instant payment using banks is an eyewash. Don't tell me you have tried international transfers and never got a phone call from banks or someone to ask you why are you sending money.
