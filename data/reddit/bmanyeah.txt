How do I know that that's gonna exist? How do you know? Even under that scenario, people can die and not tell anyone they had a wallet (it's meant to be able to be anonymous if you want, right). In that case, bitcoins are taken out of the market and still not replace.
It's not an improbable scenario....it's just a matter of time and if people can't be confident there will be bitcoin in 50 or 100 years, etc then it will never become mainstream.

and bitcoin itself would be worthless

I'm afraid you're completely missing the point.

People are gonna lose their Trezor. It doesn't matter WHAT it is: people will lose it. And, since bitcoin can't exceed 21M then eventually it will effectively go to 0 bitcoins in circulation. (Again, given enough time).

but, if only the competent hold bitcoin then it won't be mainstream.

But, as people lose bitcoin, confidence drops and bitcoin value plummets. I wouldn't call it unlikely. Just a matter of time. People are people and they lose stuff. If people can't be 100% confident their bitcoin will be there for them (or their grandkids) in 100 years then they're much less likely to participate.

And, how do you "reboot" it? We'll just create another 21M bitcoin? There's simply no way to know if the bitcoins are lost or are being hoarded.

But people would lose confidence in bitcoin if they hear multiple stories about how their neighbor lost his private key and then their aunt threw away her hard drive and lost hers. Confidence is key in any currency.

Clearly talking about gold in circulation. You're denying that people goldmine?
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:46:44
But even if we go on to smaller fractions eventually all bitcoin will be lost (because humans are human).
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:41:51
Sure, people lose gold but it is replaced by gold that is mined. In bitcoin, the lost coins don't get replaced.
EDIT: coins don't get replaced after 21M

I didn't imply that. Whatever the tech is people are people and they do stupid things.
