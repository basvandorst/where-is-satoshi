nah you was just dumb to buy bitconnect 
seriously a 20 min look on the internet could tell it  was a scam 
a company which has a computer program  which could  always make money   
ask yourself why they even told you about it  
if you had such a computer  program would you tell anyone
if bitcoin  dies they all die

I use my  Trezor with Exodus  wallet
everything is stored on the Trezor but Exodus makes it all look pretty cool

just wait till the next  halvening and the dips don't come any where near,the price you paid
life becomes a lot easier knowing no matter when you sell your making a profit

i dont like the way their web site is designed to trick people into buying  the wrong bitcoin 
if the product was good enough to stand on its own merit you shouldn't use such underhanded tactics
the whole  website   from bitcoin cash is to trick the  99% into buying the wrong coin

hodling is a lot easier when the price swings are always above what you paid

you only  gain/loose money when you sell 
my father used to  laugh at me when I bought a small amount  few years ago  and kept telling  me I should sell it to get some money back  but I held on 
now I'm in a fortunate  position  unless we see  less than a $1000 bitcoin i'm making money
you will get people telling you to sell but look at the long game  no one seriously expects bitcoin to be less than  20k in  5 years  and while nothing is guaranteed when you add the reduced supply , a greater infrastructure and demand the chances are   its going up 
so no matter how much you bought   its a waiting game 
at some point in the future you will feel very very smart 
and only  dumb that you  didn't buy more like the rest of us

the worst for me was  
saw bitcoin at 4k  
I  got paid  looked and suddenly bitcoin  was 7 k
waited   thinking it will drop  
next time i looked was 10k 
then 11k  
then 12k  
then 13k 
then 14k
I was so sad at this point thinking id missed out

Thanks I did  watch it and it explained it all

wouldn't a better way be  to divide the fees up between  the miners  and then no matter how big or small you are at least you will get some bitcoin
