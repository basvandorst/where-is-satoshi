I too had no problems at cvs this weekend. My first foot in the door to bitcoin! I picked up the red phone and gave them the info then paid up front. The cashier almost didnt include the 3.95 fee which would have screwed me over but i cought it before he finalized anything. I did have to to grab cash after my first attempt as I assumed cvs could take my debit card so had to make a bank run and go back. Anyway, did all this with my 19 month old son on one arm. Hopefully set up a nice bitcoin trust fund for him and I can tell him, years from now, that he was with me when I started. :)

If this is the case how will btc ever be mainstream?

Good thing it takes 10 years to get money into an exchange.. i was going to transfer massive funds into bitfloor via capitalone360 but they havent verified yet. Getting into bitcoins is a pain in my dick. Guess ill try mtgox via bitinstant...

Whys that? Their savings rate is decent too, i thought about moving my savings too. Bad idea?

Tell me why i should use bitcoin other than to "stick it to the man"? Im pretty patient but buying btc is insanely tedious and its 100000x easier to just pay in USD. This will never be used by the general public..

I have a scotttrade account but didnt do real well last time I invested.  I assume you mean to buy stocks, which unless youre a professional is just gambling.
