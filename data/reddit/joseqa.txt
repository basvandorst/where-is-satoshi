Thanks! if I download multibit, will I see my balance right away? (I exchanged these bitcoins 2 days ago and I haven't seen the balance yet.)

Will this affect my unconfirmed payment? (It's 2.41 BTC, a lot of risk)

Could I import the wallet to blockchain.info? and then send the BTC to my multibit?

We want to believe!

One last thing, if I want to delete all the blockchain that bitcoin-qt downloaded, where do I go?
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:25:22

So they made the money to buy that "support bitcoin value" from not selling right?

" sold all but one bitcoin" LMAO RITE

Yes m8 because of that one single transaction

All these price spikes and hundreds of BTC being sold/bought in a 
matter of seconds/minutes and [orders like these (caught by myself)]( further proves the point. (and blatantly obvious to some people with experience)  Then the market pretty much fucking dies for 1-3 weeks until the next one.

IMO transaction count is irrelevant in the sense of it affecting the price of the BTC or indicating bearish/bullish sentiments -- It is clear that the real manipulation is done by few individuals(or groups) that I would estimate that is less than 0.50% of the market (being considerably generous) so I doubt this really means anything palpable in regards of this affecting pricing, bear market is still in effect and will likely to resume for a couple months (maybe years?)
