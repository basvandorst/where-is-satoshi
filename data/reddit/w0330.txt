To be fair, you could consider the initial investment of opening the channel a "cost". But yeah, otherwise you're good to go.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:32:45
Is there a way to spend coins in a channel without closing (1 fee) and then spending them (2 fees)?
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:38:11
Ok, thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:06:35
Sorry, to clarify, I'm talking about the coins that are put into the channel to fund it. As LN adoption grows that'll be less of a cost as those coins will be more spendable, but for now some of your money would be very hard to spend.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:28:36
But then you encounter the transaction fee twice, correct?
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:36:19

Ouch, those are some low fees.

The 1mb limit was a temporary measure to prevent spam transactions. Satoshi himself was in favor of, and even suggested, raising the blocksize limit ([link](

It seems like one of the inputs for that transaction ([here]( is unconfirmed. That's why the transaction hasn't gone through yet.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:15:58
[One day until it becomes active]( Of course, knowing how it has been working will take time from the initial release.
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:20:40
Yes, correct. You pay the time for that transaction to confirm, and reap the near instant transactions that are possible afterwards.
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:54:15
Almost certainly a ponzi scheme. They promise to "double your bitcoins in 90 days", which is hillariously unrealistic. Also, they push existing members into recruiting new members, which is how they are able to sustain the scam.

Don't look at last 100 blocks, last 144 blocks, or any other metric that is so recent. Huge jumps are likely to be variance.

The transaction ID depends on all the inputs (at least at the moment, I think segwit might change that), so it won't have a transaction id until both signatures are added to the transaction.

@_date: 2017-05-09 02:50:22
[This video]( does a great job of explaining the basics of bitcoin, but for people that prefer text here's my tldr:
Bitcoin is a decentralized (read: doesn't go through banks/governments) online currency. It uses the mathmagic of cryptography to secure transactions. Many people find it appealing because it is usually more private and cheaper to use than more traditional systems like credit cards.
If you want to get started with bitcoin, I'd recommend downloading a wallet like bitcoin core, bitcoin unlimited, or electrum. You then can get some bitcoin with your fiat money via an exchange, and spend it at [the growing list]( of companies that accept bitcoin. You also can use bitcoin as an investment vehicle by buying some now and (hopefully) selling later at a higher price.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:36:08
That's really high, maybe there's another problem. Could you post the transaction ID?
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:45:22
There is no reason for anyone to relay a random old transaction. Nobody benefits.
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:31:26


Yep, so if you don't mind waiting just resend the funds with a higher fee once the transaction drops out of the mempool.
If you want to try to get this transaction through (instead of waiting for the funds to be returned) you can try [ViaBTC's accelerator]( They only accept 100 transactions each hour, so I'd try to get it in at the beginning of the hour.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:30:15
I've never used pycoin, so I can't help you with how to do it in pycoin, however the basic process is following the inputs backwards. Each input of one transaction should be an output of another, and you can follow that back to the coinbase transaction that created them.
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:11:19


There should be only one LN.


Probably similar to how bitcoin is used in real life, but transactions could be considered "safe" far faster than they could with the standard blockcahin.
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:39:28
That's a (relatively) low fee, and the miners have been unlucky with blocks in the last hour or two (really high time between mined blocks).
If it's not confirmed at the top of the hour you can try submitting it to [ViaBTC's accelerator]( (It's reached the hourly submission limit right now, but they reset it every hour).
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:22:18
A blockchain is useful for many reasons. It enables digital transfers that are:
* Faster than most conventional methods
* Highly secure
* Provable (Nobody can claim they didn't make a transaction)
* Resilient to attacks
* Publically accessible with relatively little investment needed compared to a traditional solution like a web app
It's similar to how banks are using ripple to transfer value faster with lower transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:00:20
Computer clocks are accurate, but the block "time" is when that node received it, which could be well after it was mined.
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:24:25
I personally use a full node. I'm currently running bitcoin unlimited, but there's other great choices too (example: bitcoin core).
If you don't want to use a full node, I've heard good things about electrum.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:17:53

One of the inputs is unconfirmed, that's why it's sitting there. Looks like the transaction it's waiting on is [this one](

Well, normally I'd say a couple days, but a recent core update changed the default mempool expiration time to several weeks, so I honestly don't know now.
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:22:02
Looks good to me, probably just bad luck with the block timing.
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:51:31




These contradict.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:04:45
Yes, because if the 90% loaned is deposited in a bank that bank can loan out 90% of that, and so on.
So I guess you can say about 9x is loaned in the entire system, but no one bank loans out more money than its deposits.
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:56:53
Yes, it's safe, as long as you aren't trying to keep the transaction anonymous for whatever reason.
The reason it shows 0.37 is because 0.16 went to the address, and 0.21 went back to you as change. Basically, every time you recieve bitcoin you can think of it as getting a X BTC bill. When you send bitcoin you take the bill, give some of the money to another address and the change back to yourself.
As for the long transaction time, that's probably just bad luck. If you want, you can try [ViaBTC's Accelerator]( I normally recommend that to people who have waited days because they payed a really low fee, but there's no reason it wouldn't work for you either. They reset it every hour, so as of the time of writing it will reset in about 5 minutes.

I've only had the time to watch the first 3 parts (I'll finish it later just in case there are any good insights at the end).

If the fee is high enough it should take about 10 minutes (the time to mine a block).
Otherwise, the average confimation time as of the time of writing is [32 minutes](
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:54:52
Look into the antminer series ([link](
Just a warning: Bitcoin mining is not an easy endeavor. Even if you do everything right you can still get screwed by electricity cost. I'm not saying don't do it, but make sure you fully understand what you're getting into and that you can afford to lose that money should a worst case scenario happen.
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:41:05
The method linked in the youtube video will never get to 1 or 2 transactions, he even says so in it ("this transaction is unconfirmed, it will stay unconfirmed").
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:41:27
Fee is based on the size of the transaction. The bigger the transaction, the higher the needed fee.
As for the reason it's split up - it's because each of those amounts of Bitcoin was received independently. The reason this happens is more techincal than what I want to put in a tldr, but basically treat each transaction as someone handing you a X BTC "bill".
If you want to try to speed it up, I'd try [ViaBTC's Accelerator]( They only take 100 transactions per hour, so try to get in quick at the beginning of the hour.
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:03:27


As far as I know, you should *probably* be fine here. Most relatively fee country won't prevent you from buying bitcoin or using it. (But check your laws to be sure).


If you never convert it back, you're probably fine. The reason countries expect you to pay taxes if you do convert it back is that they see it as income (Basically as if bitcoin was a stock or another investment vehicle). Again, this is a broad statement, and your country may be differnt from the norm, check your laws.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:47:31
Possibly, if the change output from that transaction is being spent in your current transaction.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:32:37
I don't think he ever said, but likely to safeguard bitcoin against (what used to be) very cheap spam transactions. As he proposed increasing it he clearly supported bigger blocks.

Uh, what? That honestly sounds like sovcit nonsense.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:24:13
This is a ridiculous non-sequitor argument.
From my understanding, you claim that because Satoshi implemented a 1mb limit he would be more in favor of LN than bigger blocks. That's obviously insane, as Satoshi himself proposed increasing the block size limit.
Maybe he would've been in favor of LN, maybe not. All we can do is speculate. However, Satoshi clearly was in favor of bigger blocks.
If you want to argue against bigger blocks because of techinical reasons, because you think it will centralize bitcoin, etc go right ahead. But please don't use a failed appeal to authority as the basis of an argument.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:40:46


Increasing the lenght of the chain requires solving a very difficult math problem. Therefore, someone would have to accumulate more power than the miners mining on the current chain to get a longer one.


Bitcoin nodes broadcast new blocks to each other, and each node keeps track of every block. Therefore, each node can evaluate which blockchain is longest independently.
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:02:17


I'm more of a BU person myself (yeah, yeah, get the downvotes ready), but congrats on supporting the bitcoin network!


If you want to control your coins from that node, you can load in your private keys or transfer your coins to an address it controls. This is not required though, you can continue to use whatever wallet you used previously if you want.


If you do set it up for your own coins, encrypt your wallet. Also, make sure you don't [reuse addresses](
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:49:15
Going to copy and paste my reply to a similar thread:
To be honest, mining bitcoin without specialized hardware (ASIC miners) is probably not going to be worth your money. These cost several thousands of dollars that most people aren't ready to spend. Also, whether or not they're profitable relies heavily on the price of your electricity.
However, you might want to consider mining another cryptocurrency, where GPUs are still competitive. I've heard that Monero and ZCash are pretty good options right now (Although note that I don't have any personal experience, so I can't guarantee that).
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:24:46
Theoretically exchanges could refuse to buy coins linked to the attack. Otherwise, no, because bitcoin is built so that noone has the power to control other people's coins. Unfortunately this makes it useful for both normal people *and* the bad guys.
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:27:25
There is no way to cancel the transaction unless the original transaction was marked as RBF. You can hope that you didn't include high enough of a fee. In any case, make sure your wallet isn't rebroadcasting the transaction.
Also, try to be more careful about where you send your money in the future ;) - there are no credit card companies in the middle, so a "chargeback" isn't a thing with bitcoin. Instead it's your responsibility to make sure you don't get caught by fraud.

looks like the transaction you linked just made it into a block, once that propagates to your node you should see a confirmation :) *EDIT: Seems like you beat me to realizing that, got the notification for your other comment just after posting this one*
If the other transaction with a lower fee is having some problems you can try [ViaBTC's accelerator]( (They only allow 100 submissions per hour, but it's about to reset).
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:11:18
There was just an unusually high [48 minute gap]( between blocks, so that's probably slowed down transactions. I wouldn't be surprised if your high fee was included in the just mined block.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:51:18
Yes, it's possible that it never gets in a block and drops out of the mempool. If that happens it will be like you never made the transaction, and you'll be able to spend the bitcoin again.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:05:34


Obviously, you wouldn't make a huge difference in total hashrate or the adoption of segwit/BU/whatever. Whether or not it would be profitable depends a lot on the cost of your electricity. I can't give any major feedback here because I haven't mined bitcoin in the ASIC age.

Try [ViaBTC's Accelerator]( They only take 100 transactions per hour, so make sure to get in at the beginning of the hour.

@_date: 2017-05-16 03:44:22
From my understanding, you are correct in that the transactions to move the funds have to be confirmed before the bitcoin can be moved again (Although, its probably possible for them all to get confirmed at once in the same block).
Fortunately for you, as of the time of writing the transaction you linked is confirmed :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:33:29

Generally, I try to push people to mining altcoins, where it's far easier to make a profit.
Also, it seems like most of the posts here on reddit asking for help are usually from fairly tech-illiterate users, and I don't want to see them lose their money for no reason. For example, yesterday I saw a post where someone asked for a website to mine on, because they were too lazy to download a mining client. They thought this would be GPU mining, and they'd be able to get some money this way.
@_date: 2017-05-16 04:13:46
In my opinion, the most barring resource requirement is harddrive space. The blockchain takes up 120+ GB and continues to grow. Almost every personal computer bought in the last 5 years can veryify bitcoin transactions, it's not that hard. However, most people don't have that much space laying around to store all the data necessary to do the validation.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:38:09
Sounds like they're asking for a message that you either signed in the past or they want you to sign now to prove that you control the sending address.
If so, it is safe (I can't verify legitimacy, as they could take this info and not issue a refund).
As to where to find this information, you should have generated it or need to generate it, excepting the sending address which you can likely check via your wallet.

There are basically no advantages to the overall community from having full blocks. Some people claim that the core developers are trying to cripple bitcoin/profiting off the higher fees because of the full blocks.

Transaction fee is really low (50 sats/byte, 200ish is good right now).

More inputs = bigger transaction = higher needed transaction fee
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:09:13
There isn't really anything bitcoin-specific going on here. A [ponzi scheme]( takes money from new "investors" to pay the promises it made to the old investors. Eventually, the scheme collapses and the schemer usually makes off with everyone's money.
Bitcoin is useful to a ponzi scheme because:
* Transactions cannot be reversed
* It keeps the schemer anonymous
* People are more likely to believe ridiculous claims, because Bitcoin is 'magic internet money'
If you just google 'ponzi scheme', you'll find a wealth of resources on how these schemes work and why they're a scam. Most explanations will use fiat currency such as dollars, but the information is still valid with bitcoins instead.

It should be faster to get more confirmations now, as it doesn't need to get into a block, just needs to have more blocks mined on top of the one it's in.
