You could do a manual child-pays-for-parent, if you have enough funds.
Freeze all coins but 1AuZj4... 0.00013018 and one other that is big enough or more coins if needed to have enough funds. 
Now send all to yourself with a very high fee. Like 3 mBTC or more because the stuck transaction is so big.
Check the transaction details and see if 1AuZj4... is included before you broadcast.

There is no format for a private key that uses 256 characters as far as I know. I assume the script unpacks and shows the private key. So you would need to get access to a Linux system. A VM or a "live Linux" would do.

You don't need the blockchain or bitcoin-qt on the offline PC. You start Armory in offline mode. There is an starter icon for that.
You may need an internet connection on the offline PC to resolve dependenies while installing. Just disconnect and never connect again before starting Armory offline and creating your first offline wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:32:55
MultiBit does not generate change addresses. If a new wallet is created, there is one new address created and stored in that wallet. As long as there is only this one address, change is sent to this address.
If there is a second address added by say importing the private key of a paper wallet, this second address will be the change address from now on.
So change will always be sent to the first or second address.

Really? I thought it was only in theory.
When does blockchain.info create compressed keys? Or is it keys imported into blockchain.info?
I thought "check private keys" would really check if the keys match. If it doesn't, that would be really sad. Together with the sync problems that does not bode well for MultiBit.
And I really need MultiBit HD to work with my TREZOR. :(

The coin selection is broken now. The developers prepare an option to disable spending of unconfirmed coins. But this option will have serious consequences too. The spendable coins in a wallet will drain very fast. Once in a while it takes an hour for the next block. Hot wallets will be drained then for sure. Hot wallets will have to contain lager amounts then or will have to be filled faster with spendable coins and drained from unspendable ones. Filling up from cold storage is a problem because that 5000BTC will be unspendable after the first transaction.
Bitcoin has now a glaring disadvantage. Any coin with unmutable transaction identifiers will look far more useful.

Look up the code for isValid. It doesn't do what you think it does.

Maybe the transaction is so big that 2 * fee is necessary?
Activate coin control and try to select a coin that is big enough.
I'm also using 0.9.2.1 on Windows.
I reviewed my transactions and there are only a few with 0.00005 and one with 0.0001.
Looks like the transactions with 0.00005 didn't need a fee in the first place. Sorry.

The private keys never leave the device.

Generating a BIP38 encrypted address/key pair and encrypting a given private key are two modes of BIP38. As they use a different prefix ( starting bytes ) they can't be the same.

I don't think I will have a need for it any time soon, so, no thanks.
I was wondering if bitcoinqt would really allow it but I think I found the key phrase, "Sign as many inputs as possible for raw transaction". So not all private keys are required.

To be really safe I would even say 1 purchase per hour ( 6 confirmations ).
If you add a large amount ( from cold storage for instance ) to your wallet you probably should split it to many addresses in order to always have enough spendable coins. I hope the clients provide an easy way to do this.

You can not recover the bitcoins yourself. If both addresses have been given to you by the same company they should be able to do the necessary accounting. Contact their support. If different companies are involved you have to contact support of the company that gave you the "past given address". They may send the bitcoins back to you.

So you want a method to derive the private key from the public key? Bitcoin would be dead if such a method exists.
Create multiple paper wallets. Use some to test the whole procedure. Distribute your bitcoins among the rest.
Another option is to import the private key into an offline wallet and sign a message with it.

Well, who needs a fork if the original is still around. From what I have seen they really tried to keep the changes to a minimum.

The problem is not receiving the unconfirmed change but spending it. Automated systems, like exchanges use, will create many, many spends with unconfirmed change. If the wrong TX ID is confirmed all those spends are illegal.
Of course the problem only shows so massively now because someone creates changed TX IDs for nearly every transaction.
And again, the reference client does use the TX ID itself and the API documentation doesn't state at all that the returned TX ID is in effect garbage and should never be used further.

A wallet.dat contains 100 unused addresses and some used addresses. Maybe "reserve" marks the unused ones?
How many used addresses there are depends on how you used the wallet.

You assume that the users have one of the multi-sig keys. That's wrong. The users don't have any access to the multi-sig keys. Bitstamp has one key and the backup key and an API key or passphrase to get Bitgo to sign transactions for them.

You do not need access to the private keys. At least not directly. It is enough if you are able to tell the hot wallet to send some bitcoins somewhere. As customer withdrawals are a main function of hot wallets, there has to be a way to do this. And this way involves other servers.

I wouldn't trust any such step-by-step guide as the steps are in the wrong order. The right order is:
* Create wallet
* Backup wallet
* Test restore of wallet
* Send bitcoins to wallet
The internet is full of stories about computers failing right after send. Never send to an address you don't have a working backup for.
@_date: 2017-01-15 08:56:05

Hmm, contact the snapcard support then. I figure they rather not sit on that bitcoins for two years.
"random jumble of words" is not a key but the "seed" to generate addresses. It is used so that you can uninstall and install the app and still are able to recreate the addresses used and get at your bitcoins again. Best to try it now so that you are used to it in case of need. ;)
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:36:24
No, you spend from B to C. That is the child transaction. A to B is the parent. You can only do this if you have the private key for B. Or if you got change back into say B' you can send B' to C as the child transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:50:36
Open yes, but you may choose another port.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:49:30
It's ok. But keep the number low because the transaction to spend will grow in size and with size will grow the fee.

So either wait until it is confirmed or close your original wallet and wait for the network to forget about the second transaction. What to do after the network has forgotten about the second transaction depends on the software of the original wallet.

It can't be accurate. It always depends on how long it takes to verify a password. Generating some public keys and checking the blockchain if they have been used takes some time. So it may take longer.

Looking at  you could get away with a fee of 40 satoshi per byte right now. You have to enable custom fees in Electrum and I would advise you to also enable RBF and set RBF for the transaction so you are able to increase the fee later if the fees in the mempool outrun your transaction.
@_date: 2015-08-28 05:36:12
Any decent wallet software will do this for you. Just send the whole balance to a new address. As mentioned, the fee will depend on the size of the transaction.
@_date: 2015-08-30 07:42:08
The offline wallet doesn't have the balance at all. So there is no need to update it.

There should always be a way to get at the bitcoin address and you could send to that bitcoin address.

My paper wallets are marked with "Wallet Version: 1.35c". If you find something like this on your paper wallet it might give a hint as to which backup type to choose. Otherwise just create two new wallets and use a different backup type for each of them.

I assume you sent different chunks of bitcoins to your wallet. ( technical term is unspent transaction output UTXO ) As long as you need only one of the chunks for the amount you want to spend, the fee stays the same. If you need two or more chunks for the amount, the size of the transaction and the fee grows.

That probably explains it then. There is a "Minimum Relay Fee".

Funds do not return. 0.14 core nodes hold transactions for 14 days now per default.
If there was change with every transaction you can try child-pays-for-parent.
Connect to an electrum node that shows all of your transactions or import the missing transactions from blockchain viewers. Do a child-pays-for-parent transaction with a manually set fee that covers the bytes of all transactions with a current satoshi per byte fee. Choose the change coins or the whole balance to send to a new address of your own.

It means that input is not confirmed. You should wait for such a transaction to confirm next time before you send stuff.
There is a whole chain of unconfirmed transactions probably because there is one transaction without fee. I'm no expert but I see no reason why the whole bunch should not confirm sometime in  the future.

I can't remember them having a recovery phrase a couple of years ago. They sent you a backup file to your email account.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:49:52
Look at 
There are many transactions with a fee like yours. As there was change you could do child-pays-for-parent.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:49:03
You need to sum the bytes of the three transactions ( $40, $200 and the child-pays-for-parent one ) and multiply by 360 sathosi to get the fee. You may subtract the fee for the $200 transaction if it was indeed substantial.
This works only if the $200 transaction sent change back to your wallet.
I have never seen a "option of "child pay for parent"" in electrum. Maybe it does the right thing.
Manually I would enable "edit fees manually", pick the change in the coins tab, right click -&gt; spend to create the transaction. Send the change to a new address. Use "preview" to check and get the number of bytes needed for the the child-pays-for-parent transaction, adjust the fee, sign and broadcast.

If you sweep an empty key nothing will happen. But you exposed the private key. It depends on your sense of security if you think you can get away with exposing the private key over and over again. You will have to sweep it again after there are funds on the address.

Well, I use BIP38 with bitaddress.org's paper wallets.
It will directly create a private key that is BIP38 encrypted. You are then able to extract the private key with bitaddress.org's Wallet Details or you can import and sweep it with a blockchain.info wallet.
BIP38 is new so not all wallets are able to import BIP38 protected private keys yet.

Well, actually you don't need backup but you may need restore.
So restore your wallet and sign a message to make sure your passwords work.
As for problems, it may not hurt to include a copy of bitcoin-qt and pywallet.

The bootloader is not protected either. They thought they protected it but the chip is faulty. Now they use the fault to update the bootloader if necessary.
They blow the fuse on the debugger function so there is no easy way to read the internal flash.
Use a passphrase and you are protected from any such problems.

Create a buy order with a price you are sure will be profitable. I think less then 0.09 now. If you are lucky the owner will include you in his next sell off.
With the latest flash crash someone got lucky at 0.01. should be profitable.
Replace order in time of course.

Just give them a BIP38 protected private key. It's so easy now with BIP38.

What happens if you lose your removable drive or it is stolen?
Most likely you will forget your passphrase for your encrypted wallet though.

If you are scared, you are not converted.
If you can't wait with spending your bitcoins until the next all-time-high after the crash, then don't buy any.
Yes, just assume there will be a crash and assume all bitcoins you buy will be immediately worthless.
You will be happy then every time you buy something with your worthless bitcoins.

Tools -&gt; Export Private Keys
MultiBit doesn't create new addresses for change so you don't need to do a backup ever again as long as you don't create new receiving adresses yourself.
Backup now!
As for password, can't hurt if you don't forget it. It will be painful if you do forget it and need the backup.

You have to ask your bank how to do a SEPA transfer. You need online banking for this. How long it takes depends on how complicated your bank makes it for you.
This is just about giving the order. The SEPA transfer will of course not complete in 90 min.
If you do give the order and you do not "Mark payment complete" in 90 min, you are fucked.
Just make the order and "Mark payment complete" in 90 min and you are good.
It really should take you a lot less than 90 min to do it.

Someone reported doing faulty trades while alone on the site using the backdoor. This has nothing to do with high frequency.
His lack of communication and his delusions are the biggest FAILs.
He should have started to do something two weeks ago.

Keyfiles are for backup.
I recommend to store an unencryped keyfile to CDROM. Store an encrypted keyfile on an USB stick or similar and somewhere online.
Then encrypt your wallet and never create a new key or else you have to start all over again. (MultiBit sends change to the old address)
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:33:08
This is the right thing to do.
You should announce it on the site.
If it is not a full access, you should say something about the pending orders. Can you remove all pending orders? At least announce that you will not start the trading engine before users had a chance to remove their orders.

Screenshot please!
You did get your version of Armory from  didn't you?
If you have the Bitcoin Armory ( Offline ) icon, use it to start Armory. It may complain less.
Ah, I got I now. If you start Armory in online mode, I think it is reasonable that it should have been working online at least once.
The reason they give in the dialog box "Armory is still beta software, and some users report difficulty ever getting online." is an OK warning as you started Armory in online mode.

Yes, withdrawal is manual. Most users already got their bitcoins out so it doesn't happen very often now.
You may consider creating a support ticket before contacting the lawyers but a reply to a support ticket will probably also take a few days.

I think more bitcoins have been lost to forgotten passwords now than to any other cause.
BIP38 is very hard. Didn't you notice how long it takes to create the password.
"carbon" is good enough. It's hard enough to get at the paper, isn't it`?
If you want to make it extra hard throw in an unicode symbol like e.g. the ᛏ rune or any other unicode symbol you like.
