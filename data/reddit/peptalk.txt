I don't know if you're trolling or not but you're right about one thing, if you start applying online behaviours to IRL social behaviour then people will think you're rather strange.  But if you think that IRL behaviours and online behaviours are in anyway synonymous then you must be very new to the internet.

First you shouldn't take investment advice from random people on the internet. Bitcoin is considered 'high risk/high reward (or high loss)' at the moment because it is such a new and unproven concept. While it has shown to return great gains in it's brief existence there's no guarantee that it will continue to. I suggest you read and learn as much as possible about it and then see how much you believe in it's future. Most people here will tell you to not invest more than 1-5% of your total worth. If you lose it all you don't want to be financially devastated.

Bit already has multiple meanings, do people get confused? No we don't call blue "taco" but what point does that even make? The point is we can use 'blue' to mean other things (sad, sexy) and that doesn't confuse us. In fact we like it! It opens the door to poetry and wordplay.

@_date: 2014-09-13 18:07:20
Exactly. Mining a block right now right now will earn you $12,090. So people will be motivated to spend almost that much to mine one. If value goes up then more people will spend more money on mining equipment which makes the difficulty higher. If it goes down then people will drop off the system and difficulty will decrease. Economically speaking it will likely cost *almost* as much to mine a block as the block reward is worth. So unless you're doing it on a large scale it's hardly worth it.

NO IT IS NOT OK!! Bitcoin is a DECENTRALISED currency. As soon as one entity is controlling the whole system, even if they never attack it, Bitcoin is CENTRALISED by a power we don't even know. It will completely undermine it's trust and value. This is a massive flaw in the protocol and MUST be addressed. I agree 51% is inevitable but you are delusional if you think it's not a problem. Would ANYONE have bought bitcoins if they were distributed by an unknown centralised source?? Of course not. But that's how worthless bitcoin may easily become.

Doge &amp; Bit are brothers. There's NO ONE in Doge that has not heard of Bitcoin or doesn't understand it's benefits. Mission accomplished. I personally don't own a single doge but to quote '7trXMk6Z' from another thread: 
dogecoin is amazing. it brings much needed light-heartedness to the bitcoin world and is fantastic marketing. it helps spread bitcoin because people both can't make fun of it (because it makes fun of itself) and they aren't afraid to ask questions or learn about it (because the atmosphere is relaxed). it also by extension pokes fun at the whole monetary system by saying "see this joke coin is silly, and yet it's still more powerful than anything else being used in the world of finance". dogecoin is nothing but a good thing for bitcoin and bitcoiners should embrace it. dogecoin will convert far more people due to its attitude.

Yes, you have to assume that miners want to keep their BTC and keep the value high. You have to assume that every player is rational and 'good'. You have to assume that no power would want to harm the bitcoin network or to take it hostage. You have to assume way too much and have a whole lot of blind faith. Do terrorists care about the extremely high cost of weapons? Do governments? How much would the bitcoin network be worth if it were IMPOSSIBLE to attack? It is theoretically possible to secure the protocol and what I think we should strive to achieve. Saying there's no problem with Bitcoin when it has such vulnerabilities to attack is ignorance. This is an experiment, Satoshi is not god, bitcoin is not perfect, but it could be...
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:38:47
What I'm getting at is these all make it easy to attain bitcoins, great, no argument there. But why do people want bitcoins? Ask the average person if they want bitcoins? That's my point here. They can get them easily, but do they *want* them? These things you list are cool but as I stated they don't make bitcoin more attractive to 'mainstream' users. We need cool apps for that.

I'm holding out hope that every internet browser (on phone, tablet whatever) has a wallet incorporated (or easily added as a plugin like KyrptoKit) and that this is directly associated with 'tip' buttons and paywalls. Once you give it permission you can just one click tip anyone and one click read an article for a few cents, maybe less. You would only need to keep pocket change in these things. It would be so easy to crowd fund with this way too. 100,000 people might tip a facebook post 20cents each and bam there's $20,000 direct to the source. It could be hooked up direct to Coinbase or similar with auto top-up straight from your bank account when below a threshold. When this available in many countries THEN you get universal mass adoption of bitcoin. Merchants accepting bitcoin IMO will never be a catalyst for mass adoption.

Also to answer your OP I think the world will use bitcoin for things that money right now simply can't do. Online micro transactions (this alone I think has the potential to take bitcoin to mass adoption) and an autonomous digital economy of 'things'. Think your car, phone, anything you like having a wallet and 'voting' for whatever suits it's purpose. It's an exhilarating concept. Read this:

I don't necessarily think it will kill it. Just prevent it from reaching it's huge potential. I strongly disagree with your opinion that centralisation is not an issue. In fact it's the core foundation of the entire protocol.  Decentralised trust. That's the revolution here. The mining issue undermines the promise of decentralised trust and makes us rely on incentives. If the system has to rely on people being GOOD rather than EVIL then IMO it's deeply flawed.

Well you don't speak for me. One of the most exciting aspects of Bitcoin for me is the potential for it to be the cash of the internet. Finally making paying/tipping for content seemless and dare I say fun. While I think the cryptographic science behind Bitcoin is sexy as all shit those massive crypto addresses are unmemorable and a big nerdy turn off for most people. Fortunately there is so many solutions for this that it will be solved easily. Actually It's already solved with TipBot and what not.

Yes. This. BUT ALSO I want to see Pay To Stream set ups. Imagine a web wide monetised streaming plugin. The spotify model for the whole web. You load up a browser wallet with 10 bucks or whatever and then you are microtipping for video plays, music streams, news articles, whatever. With a checkbox option this could be completely seamless, and in that moment we create more jobs in media and entertainment than you can imagine.

@_date: 2014-03-03 22:55:46
I agree, all these reasons are 'nifty' but none of them are total game changers. IMO the GAME CHANGING features of bitcoin that we have never had before are:
* Global and decentralized. Like the internet. No one entity can control it. 
* Microtransactions. This is huge. Soon enough everyone will have some petty cash (bitcoin) charged in their browser and phone and they can easily tip a video, or article, or browse straight through a paywall, pay 3 cents for a news article or something, and it's going to be seamless. It will monetize the internet. Huge.
* Its programmable cash. Anything with a computer in it (like any modern car) can have a bitcoin wallet. This is a new concept but technology can essentially own it's self. It's weird and I wont go into it. If you want to know more about this let me know and I'll dig up some links. 
* It's not just about money. The bitcoin protocol is a decentralised ledger. It can be used for 'smart contracts' and all sorts of things that requires trust (read Lawyers). Money is just the first app of the block chain, like email was for the internet.
* Access to anyone. BILLIONS of people in the world can not get a bank account. Now they can.
There's probably more. As a POS payment system Bitcoin doesn't really excite me, but this stuff blows my mind. Like the internet, it's going to take a lot of people a long time to really get how significant all this is.

I suspect we fundamentally agree. Bitcoin is in beta. There's things to fix. And the main one is the mining issue. It's not plain FUD if it's true.

Digital currency is too revolutionary to not succeed, and one coin can't be all things to all people. This is why we will always have altcoins. ONE of the coins will be mainstream and most likely won't be very anonymous at all. Another will be super anonymous and so likely banned by all major states. The argument taking place here is *which one of these is Bitcoin?* Personally I vote the former, it's just too hard to operate on a jumbo jet mid flight. Fortunately Peter can simply fork and do what he sees fit.

For the same reason they're called "Pounds" "Dollars" "Yen" etc rather than "Buytokens". It's a known psychological effect that suggests authority and trust that marketing geniuses use all the time. I guess I'm copping a lot of downvotes here because people aren't aware of it. It's not my idea that I just pulled out of my arse. Many hugely popular brands don't describe anything about what they do. It allows people to develop their own relationship to them.  Nike, Gucci, Apple, Google, Pepsi, Fox, Nintendo, Shell, Prada, Starbucks, Sony, Dell, just like Pounds, Dollars, Yen, they don't mean a thing until you associate it with something tangible. I just would prefer 'Bitcoin' to be in that abstract category rather than the "Microsoft" captain obvious category.

Great! I'm no dev. Just an ideas guy tech enthusiast (thus why I'm lurking here) I struggle to program my alarm clock...
There's a few things that need to happen that are a bit out of our control, coinbase type services in other countries (Australia has CoinJar, but they struggle to keep a bank account, nothing like this in the UK). Basically it needs to be super easy for people to buy bitcoins and that's still a little bit off. The browser wallet though, there's plenty that could be done there. Browser wallets exist (kryptokit is cool) but it's the embedable button/widget relationship that's the clincher. Bitcoin addresses are ugly and need to be hidden behind the scenes.

I know the positives of bitcoin, I hear them every day around here, I think all the speculative investment in Bitcoin has made people terrified of talking about it's shortcomings. If Bitcoin can't take critisim then IT IS A PONZI. Fact.
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:49:32
Owning your own keys is great, though it's debatable if that's 'the most important' part. I think that could be the killer app in countries with severely fucked up economies where people want to do bank runs. In the west not so much. But if you have to convince people of Bitcoin's attraction by first explaining the inadequacies of the current financial system, then it ain't going mainstream in a hurry. The value of Killer apps speak for themselves, instantly. People see it and simply go "YES!"

IMO the 'Killer App' is not about using bitcoin in brick and mortar places at all. I think that has to be covered sure but I don't think that's enough to make people go "WOW, I HAVE TO HAVE THAT". It's just a nerdy way to do what people do every day fine already. 
The **KILLER APP** must do a few things
* Do something credit cards/cash can't do AT ALL. (not the same thing quicker, or decentralised, or without charge backs, that's not enough)
* Have social value, especially for young people
* Be dead dumb simple
Your idea is cool, I like the E-Ink, but IMO it's no killer app.
So what's my idea?
I have a few, here's one that already exists in early stages with ChangeTip.
Online Micropayments.
What needs to happen:
* 'On ramps' to BTC must be dead simple. Circle are going to nail this. Bitcoin will never go mainstream unless people can get hold of and manage it dead easily.
* Browser based wallets (urls or plug-ins) have to be slick. NO raw bitcoin addresses anywhere! Just a simple handle. Kryptokit is cool but the GUI and UX can be greatly improved. Ideally it would be incorporated seamlessly with your Circle account.
* A simple widget that blogs/sites can install. Like the 'Tweet this' type buttons except it can be employed in comments threads etc. 
* clicking the button micro-tips the post your default amount, bang, one click, done.
* Clicking the button in a comment box tips the post or who your replying to. 
* You buy 10 bucks worth of BTC and can instantly tip someone online with it within 5 minutes.
Imagine when all those charity posts on Facebook can raise money right there on your wall buy hitting 'like'. All your friends can see what a charitable person you are. Imagine a band crowd funding a project right there on their wall in facebook.
This to me is much more appealing to the young generation than buying stuff at the shop in a different way.

News article about Silk Road put it on my radar for the first time, about a year ago. Looked into it as was fascinated that there was a new digital anonymous money. Asked a few geeky friends about it, one had heard about it but didn't know a great deal (told me people 'farm' them on computers, sounded super bizarre) then I forgot about it. Then in October I started reading about it again in the news, looked further into it and then the price started rising and of course that made me even more intrigued. Read more and more and saw it hit $200 and thought "if it breaks the previous ATH I'm in". It was broken 5 days later and in I went and it CONSUMED ME. Couldn't read enough about it. I got nothing done for 2 months at least...
EDIT: didn't answer OP's question. Lightbulb was Global Peer-to-Peer x Limited Supply x Programable money

Paper wallet.
If you generate a new bitcoin address on an offline computer (using (private and public key) you can print it off so it's never been exposed to the internet. You can then send your coins to this address. When you want to spend them you can import the private key to a blockchain.info web wallet or any other bitcoin wallet software. If you want a digital back up you could take a photo of the paper wallet with a camera that takes an SD card and just store the SD card for instance.

I totally agree on all points. And I do think every single one of them will be solved in time. But Bitcoin doesn't even need to attempt to replace regular money at all to be a game changer. For developed nations I think Bitcoins greatest trick is micropayments. I think it will ultimately get adopted as the universal cash of the internet, and not for buying things off amazon. I envision a time when the average bitcoin user only ever has around £10 of bitcoin, charged up in their browser and phone to surf through paywalls seamlessly and to tip the odd cool video or whatever. They'll just buy it like people now by phone credit.

The price of bitcoin is determined 100% by speculation. The majority of those speculators are in China. Before China got involved the price was below $200 and they threw 100's of millions at bitcoin to get it over $1000 and it will take 100's of millions to get it back there.

I had two addresses in Kryptokit, none of them backed up.
This is them:
As you can see they are hardly whale addresses :)
I saw this message and opened chrome, Kryptokit was still there so I quickly hit backup and it displayed this:
YES I've just posted a private key on Reddit. It only has 0.00949999 BTC The thing is when I type that key into blockchain.info wallet it says it's invalid. If any of you can import it then you might like to return it, or keep it, I request you use it to tip people around here though please if you do.
The other address has no back up. I haven't tried the above method yet.
As soon as I backed up Kryptokit it was gone, a message displayed saying has been removed.
Now I want to reinstall it and I get this message: 
I've tried restarting my machine but no dice.
Now I have Chrome installed on another computer with kryptokit. I might get a brief instant again to backup my keys before it's removed. I'm going to disable WiFi now and fire it up and see how I go. I shall report back.

I'm sure they will provide traditional currencies too, but probably with a traditional monthly subscription model. Paywall's largely fail because people don't like regular money being extracted in chunks out of their bank account for a newspaper (for example) that they don't even read all of, and sometimes not at all. Now imagine there's an option to get rid of the subscription and just pay for what you read, it may be a very small amount, and you pay a very small amount. Are you going to pay 10 cents with paypal or credit card and cop the fees? Maybe, if you're a bit crazy. What about a fraction of a cent? Now that's impossible. And the day you want to do that is the day you get some bitcoin and realise finally how effortless and easy and awesome it is. I suggest that you don't wait that long and dip your toe in now (you are on this sub so you must be a bit intrigued).

The lost coins just make all the 'unlost' ones more valuable. Don't forget a whole bitcoin can be divided down to 0.00000001 so there's more than enough individual coins to go around. Yes it makes it more deflationary. Is that good? I can't say. We've never had a deflationary global currency before. That's one for the economists to work out. I think we are about to find out soon enough if it works or not ;)

Lots of good ideas here, while we do need better wallets/exchanges/POS systems I'd like to see some development exploiting the unique aspects of bitcoin (rather than building stuff that focuses on replacing existing payment systems)
Mainstream adoption will happen quickly when we have fun and viral applications for bitcoin. 
Some ideas: (I've no idea how hard this stuff is to build, I'm a music producer...)
* Twitter tip bot
Better still a web wide tip bot. People will love bitcoin if we can give them free money. As I said, no idea if this is possible, but it would be amazing.
* Browser based wallet combined with tip widgets/buttons
Charge up your browser with some bitcoin. Make 'tip me' buttons for putting under articles/videos whatever and clicking them automatically deducts that amount from your wallet and tips them. No big ugly bitcoin addresses, just nice sexy buttons. Got to be slick and seemless.
* Pay per second video player.
Uses the same browser wallet. You only pay for the amount of seconds you watch of the video. It just deducts automatically when you enable it.
I've got more ideas. I'm convinced that bitcoin's coolest trick is micro monetization apps. This is something that has NEVER been possible before, frankly I couldn't give a toss if I can ever buy my lunch with bitcoin, cash can do that, but cash can't do this stuff.

I haven't found this whole debate particularly interesting. I agree there is a great need to adopt a smaller unit and 'Bits' is such a logical name for it. It's seems like a no-brain solution. It's a bit of a bitcoin. Easy. Everyone who is up in arms that John Citizen will get confused because 'bits' is used for all sorts of other stuff is misled. I am John Citizen, I don't think I've used bits to mean byte or something technical EVER. A bit is a bit of something. English is full of words with multiple meanings and Chinese has even more. Humans are fine with this stuff end of story.

True. People like Nathaniel Borenstein dismiss bitcoin prematurely , they don't see the whole picture. They look at it as just a currency. And a currency it's self doesn't really have value.

If you are a young professional in a developed nation that quite likes their banks and credit cards and doesn't want to speculate on Bitcoin, what's the attraction?
Well prob not a lot right now to be honest, but give it 5-10 years and most people on this sub expect it to be:
* Adopted globally by the majority of major and minor online retailers
* Adopted by a hell of a lot of brick and mortar retailers too, globally.
* THE preferred method of monetizing internet content (paywalls, media streams, micro tipping, lot's and lot's of apps for this)
* lots of other neat stuff that might not effect you directly (international remittances, banking the billions that can't get bank accounts now...)
People like you will only use it when they basically have to to pay for some content online. It's a while off, come back in 5 years, but don't complain if the price is 10x what it is now ;)

Don't forget Bitcoin is highly inflationary at the moment. It takes MILLIONS each day of fresh cash to maintain the price (assuming miners are selling and that's a very popular assumption right now).

A lot of videos about bitcoin fail in that they try to explain too much. Bitcoin is very very complicated to non tech people. When people feel like they don't understand something they don't tend to trust it. (x1000 when it's money)
I say produce some short (under 2 mis) vids in a series that focus on different aspects of bitcoin with themes like:
* what is it? (Secure digital cash that can't be counterfeited. Micropayments, international payments)
* What isn't it? ('virtual money', untracable drug money, hackable at the protocol level)
* Future applications
* Mining
* how do I get some and how do I protect it?
* etc etc

**Analogy:** (please correct me, I'm just working this out myself)
Imagine that all global currencies are backed by gold. You can buy Euro, Sterling, USD, with your gold, trade between them if you like and then later convert them back to gold. The thing is that none of these currencies are ever minted (mined) they can only ever be acquired in the first place by buying them with gold.
It doesn't have to be a currency either, it can be a share, contract, whatever. Since everything is backed by gold, then gold is extremely valuable. Now replace gold with BTC and everything else with whatever you fancy.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:36:10

@_date: 2014-06-08 17:38:24
In my mind I just wish it were technically impossible to attack the system. Like if mining power had diminishing returns as the threshold approaches. If the network were technically bullet proof I'd probably dump my life savings into it TBH.

Once Paypal offer a secure bitcoin wallet then hopefully that will be crunch time for Apple. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:10:40
No because any individual can hold as much BTC as they like, and you can't destroy BTC, so number of people and price aren't hard linked. The price moves down when supply out paces demand. Theoretically though, if every single bitcoin owner said tomorrow that their bitcoin is worth $10,000 each then you've suddenly raised the market cap by 125 Billion without spending a dollar. I'm just thinking through this with you, I'm no economist and welcome anyone to explain if this is theoretically wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:51:04
Sure. But if the protocol is also designed to be trustless isn't that a paradox?  From what I've read the Trustless &amp; Decentralised part is the crux and true valuable innovation here. Your consensus argument is in part just twisted semantics once you acknowledge that it's a single party providing said 'consensus'.

You're saving this so you can future troll me?! Lol. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:25:44
Can you, Bitcoin advocate, imagine what this protocol would be worth is there were NO WAY TO ATTACK IT?? I for one are glad this issue gets attention. I sincerely hope it gets a technical solution. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:40:55
Oh I don't have a solution! I'm no dev. The only thing I've ever programmed is my alarm clock. I'm coming at this as a curious tech interested consumer. Isn't  the beginnings of simplifying the UX?
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:34:59
This is actually news.
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:04:58
Yes exactly. Do governments or terrorists that launch expensive missiles think about the cost if their investment? I too am banking on this being solved. But it's not solved. And my point is, again, that the governments of the world are not going to store the wealth of the earth in a decentralised digital system that can be POTENTIALLY compromised. Ask yourself: If bitcoin were theoretically uncompromisable how much more valuable would it be?
This won't be solved unless we first admit it's (IMO) the biggest flaw in the protocol.
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:29:26
I agree that if 51% becomes a problem then bitcoin is dead. Further, I think if it's theoretically possibly, and it is, then bitcoin is flawed and will fail in reaching it's full potential. You can't base the entire world's economy in unknown and corruptible hands. Does your opinion that "there is no solution" have much support? I don't see many solutions proposed myself, but apparently there was a time not so long ago when many said the Byzatine Generals problem had no solution...

And the Aboriginals there are the oldest living culture on the planet by a LONG way. Amazing continuous living culture in Australia for 50,000 years! And now they are largely ruined by alcohol, ignored by the government, and treated as third class citizens by most everyone else. It's one of the saddest situations on the planet and deserves a WHOLE lot more international attention before it's going to get better.
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:18:21
Well the profitability would come from extortion. In a future scenario where Bitcoin is an international standard reserve currency, and suddenly a shedload of hashing power gets switched on representing &gt;51% and takes the blockchain hostage, the potential for extortion is immense. Would you know for sure who it was? I'm not saying it would definitely happen or is even likely, I'm saying that the potential for it to happen, the weakness in the way mining is structured, undermines the value and resilience of the network as a whole. Remember that people tend to be 1) Hyper protective of the economy 2) Spooked by technological bogeymen 3) Have nightmares about terrorism. Ideally Bitcoin should assure these fears. To be clear, that's my point here. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:57:03

Nope. A lot less than the US government prints every day actually.  And if you think bitcoin (if it grows) does not pose a threat to government powers then I would politely suggest you are being a little naive. Governments wage multi trillion dollar wars to protect their interests.

No one has EVER had their mind changed with an insult. The best way to change someone's mind is to let them believe they changed it themselves. You do this but not creating a right or wrong situation and pointing people in the direction of self discovery. Encourage people to look further into Bitcoin and it will speak for itself.

For me it's not anything that improves money [remittances, finite supply, access to banks, anonymity...] but the things that **money can't ever do.** All the ideas around your fridge, car, house, the pavement, whatever, having a wallet and creating a whole economy around 'things'. This is insane and no-one can truly yet appreciate how this will change the world.

Correct me if I'm wrong: once a single party has more than 51% of the hashing power then we have to trust them to be 'good'. We trust VISA to be 'good' as well, but we know who VISA are. The great thing about Bitcoin is that you don't HAVE to know who they are. But that's not actually true once a single party has 51% of the power and therefore 100% of the consensus. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:19:38
The internet of things is inevitable and coming very quickly. But PLEASE let's all make sure it's as anonymous and decentralised as possible or we are just inviting a nightmare surveillance world into every part of our lives. I think this is the greatest fight we have on our hands. Anonymity is simply privacy and at this micro level where your toaster could be a spy, privacy needs to be treated as a human right.  Big movements are being made already (CISCO, IBM, some Chinese ones). The privacy and decentralisation of this tech is IMPERATIVE. Humans, learn from history, **let's not FUCK THIS UP!!**

True. And sure bitcoin could go to zero and we don't know it wont. But the theory doesn't factor that in, it's based on the assumption that the currency is solidly deflationary, like gold, or indeed like bitcoin would be if universally adopted.

Whatever his agenda there is no doubt that part of it is for Bitcoin to be a huge success. He is dedicating his life to it. Unfortunately has become a place where serious discussion about the threats/weaknesses/flaws in this BETA software is highly discouraged. Bitcoin has countless challenges to overcome on the pathway to success. But if you bring any of them up here people are likely to scream FUD!! TROLL!! at you and run off and hide under their emotionally filled paperwallets whispering 'to the moon' to themselves.

Sorry I wasn't clear, I was referring to the whole 'bit's is a bad name because it means [something else] already' debate. And also sorry, bits doesn't mean bytes, OK, I don't even know what it means technically. Kilobits? I mean that's my whole point really. I don't know! It's certainly not going to confuse me for one second having 'bits' mean a unit of currency along side the many multiple meanings it has. Because I'm a human and humans EXCEL at this kind of thing. This is why a 2 year old has a much better understanding of language than a computer does. Don't think like a computer humans! Bit's is fine, I hope it gets adopted because I've never liked 'Bitcoin' as an everyday name. Too literal. It's like calling Dollars/Pounds/Yen/Euro 'spend tokens'. 'Bitcoin' is daft because it's too obvious. Having a bit of a ramble here aren't I?

Yeah that's the idea with just having a predetermined default amount based in your native currency. The 5 cent button. If only a wallet provider could hedge against volatility and you could store in USD or whatever you choose. Then people would have no idea it's bitcoin at all.

Well yeah you *could* give them a stolen card, drink there all night (most likely on CCTV) and then do a runner. You could also just mug someone for their cash and spend that on your booze...
Paying bitcoin up front for a load of drinks and then getting change later is a bit inelegant, can't see it taking off. I think ideally with bitcoin it will be so effortless to pay for each drink that starting a tab is redundant.

* Do you believe in Bitcoin long term (5-10 years)?
* Would you like to invest in it early? 
If YES to both then
* Would you like to pay $1000 for each Bitcoin or $100 or $10 or $1?
Bitcoin is FAR too risky for short term profits.
If you have held for over 18 months and you have not seen a return, only then shall you be allowed to be concerned. Until then just chill and contribute to the incredible technological breakthrough that is happening around us.
TL;DR If you believe in Bitcoin long term then the price dropping for a while is good.

Guys, girls, digital currencies are here to stay. At least **one** of them is going to be regulated up the arse and institutionalised and centralised and fully integrated into the powers that be. That one may be Bitcoin. I'm not saying this is the most favourable outcome but for anyone that wants to see global adoption of digital currencies then **one** of them will be institutionalised. It's completely unavoidable. If it's not Jeremy leading the charge it WILL be someone else. Just like the internet with it's decentralised promise became dominated by centralised powers, it will leave many wanting a more anonymous untraceable, unstoppable, alternative so IT TOO will be inevitable. Just saying that maybe it's not going to be Bitcoin. Time will tell and we will learn a hell of a lot along the way.

Yep it's a standard camera with flash drive, not iphone constantly duplicating photos everywhere, I'd prob end up putting it on facebook... The idea of the photo is to encrypt it (password 7-zip or something) and dropbox it should I ever need the funds when not anywhere near the physical paper wallets. What would be a great tool is to some how hide a QR code in a normal looking .jpg photo of your cat or whatever. And it's only revealed when you apply a certain filter. It might not be the safest method for your life savings but could be handy for certain applications. You could create treasure hunts and hide them in all sorts of places.

Def a producers fee. 10% Distribution 90% label/artist for example. If you wanted major labels on board it would have to be a private company I guess, so all files are verified, like current digital stores. ATM you would send your music to a digital distributer and they then send to iTunes/Spotify/Amazon/eMusic/etc. They could conceivably send to this site as well, or as an independent artist you send directly. As I said, I haven't practically thought it through. I do love how bitcoin could conceivably be implemented directly into software itself to automate micro payments across a user base. There could/would be a pirate version of the same thing I guess where anything goes but that's not what I'm suggesting.
