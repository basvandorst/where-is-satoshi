Bots like this operate on every exchange service in the world, on every asset, shares, forex, bonds, etc. Most success they have are on illiquid stocks. Hardly surprising they are operating on bitcoins. As long as they are transactions between a buyer and a seller they are legal and are a part of financial life. HFT's are the most common, and are used a lot by hedge funds.

Yes, they do. Multiple tiny trades in an instant used to trigger stops set by other participants at speeds you can't beat manually, also preventing them from getting the best price they can. In this instant, it has the added benefit of overloading the relatively small trading engine. The DDOS is not legitimate, the rest is, you should return to primary school if you can't manage your investments wisely.
