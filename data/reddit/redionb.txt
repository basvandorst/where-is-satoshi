Will this have any meaning for the MtGox case?

Don't forget that Google will show you bitcoin.org above other portals.

Care to explain this?

That's true, they are different. But they both (will) have the private keys of the user's wallet. Also, PayPal froze my account without giving me any reason (this happened after donating to wikileaks) so they do have that in common...

I heard a former BFL employee fart "R A I D" in morse code through a walkie-talkie.

Okay.

Bitcoin + PayPal can only mean one thing and that's more centralization. Which is far from my wet dream. In fact it's the opposite.

For example, there's
 * [Electrum for Android](
 * [Bitcoin Wallet](
 * [Blockchain for Android](

I don't see how you can jump to your conclusion from my statement. I just think we should aim for more decentralization. If we use PayPal for Bitcoin transactions, we give PayPal more power over Bitcoin and over us. That's a very hard lesson I had to learn from Mt.Gox.

They just don't want to be a part of the deception and don't care about journalists. I can't blame them, especially after reading a piece like the BBC wrote (and I bet they would've wrote it even if it would be called Rainbow Market).

I guess so. They lead to wxp URI's. The last one has a donkey in the middle and leads to wxp://f2f0hZRH9IOdJX9tPXt6UEENYBJ5gKt8di1d
