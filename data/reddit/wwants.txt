Opposing sides of discussion are a sign of a healthy community. If everyone agreed on all sides of such complicated issues I'd be more worried.

It's almost like there are multiple people with diverse opinions. Wow.

Wow, that goes to show how little I understand about bitcoin. Got any good links to read to understand that better?

You say that as if it's a bad thing and then you criticize people for having differing opinions. Sounds like you're just looking for something to criticize either way.

Does "spend" simply mean "transfer to another address"? 
Is this number meant to show that lots of coins that hadn't been traded in a while were traded yesterday? In other words, some long term investors were cashing out?

Fantastic, thanks man. I've got a lot of reading cut out for me.

Yes if they know you are offering to sell. This app connects sellers with buyers using gps and then facilitates the trade. Seems like a pretty awesome value proposition.

This. What does "days destroyed" mean?

This can't be emphasized enough. Bitcoin almost completely removes all the typical hurdles in checkout that keep people from completing the process. Encouraging more people to adopt bitcoin and learn to donate with it can only help increase Wikipedia's donations.
