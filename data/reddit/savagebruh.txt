no bitcoin's regular transactions don't need any help with that. They're already complete dog shit when it comes to back log and speed.

Thanks, I have downloaded Jaxx and created a wallet. There was a blue notification at the top that mentioned something about backing it up but it disappeared before I had finished reading?

It may fall much harder once the exchanges have gotten a handle on the traffic.

BTC will be worthless if mainstream people realize the scaling issues that have plagued the bitcoin community for far too long now. If a choice isn't made and transaction fees stay high or worse -  rise then bitcoin will begin to fail. I believe most of the buying pressure right now is exposure due to the ETF and people hoping for free ride to $. What those people don't know is that there are many new crypto's with advanced underlying code &amp; functionality itching to replace the top dog right now... I'm still HODL 'ing my half a BTC but I am realistic about the situation. BTC value is derived from its users when their are other options in the market

People like you believing bitcoin is only a currency are causing the collapse of this tech. Bitcoin is so far behind other blockchain techs now its hilarious. Have fun riding your ignorance into the ground. Bitcoin will fail unless progress is made soon.

no clue what you mean. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:10:31
No it won't but I'm not going to bother trying to change your mind. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:43:34
Kind of redundant to bet against the thing your betting with, &amp; then get a payout in what you betted against, overall gain but its weird when you really think about it. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:19:45
I completely understand. I also never said gold or altcoins were any better at any of those things. I simply said that there are a lot of new innovations happening in the blockchain world, shards, zsnarks, pos, smart contracts, right now bitcoin seems to be behind on all of these things and has been stuck in the block size debate for way too long. Idk how i was turned into an altcoin lover. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:58:48
lmfaaaoooo if you think the other coins out there cant do anything you're either high as a kite or too stupid to read. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:49:28
All relative to their wallet size i guess. For all we know he paid $10 a coin so it could mean nothing

You are wrong about bitcoin Remindme! 3 months
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:47:25
Agreed I completely get it. Just a strange bet, especially if the price were to fall by a lot more than what it is now. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:11:15
Im not an altcoiner. I believe in the full potential of the blockchain &amp; that doesnt stop at currency. I still believe bitcoin has a function and is the strongest network. This may change, it may not. But if you think bitcoin is innovating in anyway right now then you need to pull your head out of your ass

umm they actually said they'd let the majority decide by allowing the longest blockchain to be considered bitcoin. If more hashing power switches to BT2 then that is now bitcoin, thats how it was outlined in the whitepaper. The network decides who wins.

I like the cryptography in monero. Its fascinating, i like zk snarks too and am excited to see them implemented into apps as ethereum builds its tooling. 
I also like the potential in a DAG like iotas, but it hasnt been tried and tested like a blockchain. My mind is open.

@_date: 2017-10-14 02:39:02
Its not. There are major problems with proof of work (miner centralization &amp; network control when they get too big, speed of hashing, electricity consumption). POS has its own issues too (you have to own the coin to participate rich get richer sort of thing. nothing at stake problem with certain implementations, and some other game theory issues). There are tradeoffs for either one, but i feel as though software and cryptography will allow POS to gain an advantage over the hardware &amp; resource heavy requirements of POW

I have taken plenty of accounting courses. Just because you can balance the books doesn't change the fact that the banks don't have the actual physical assets to pay all the liabilities outstanding. A bank can lend 10 dollars for every 1 dollar in its reserves. The banks physical assets are not collateral for these loans. Just because assets exist out there doesn't mean that they are required to be used to pay bad loans.

Smart Contracts/Dapps -Ethereum
Privacy - Monero
Speed - Almost every other major coin
Data Storage - Siacoin
TX throughput - Bitshares
I accept the downvotes because I realize this is a bitcoin sub. &amp; you don't have to like any of these coins, hell i don't like half of them. But it doesn't make me wrong.

You’re so thick it hurts. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:43:19
You are wrong, banks can lend out more debt than their are assets to cover it. Fractional reserve banking. If a bond price falls to zero because theirs no chance of collecting than its not an asset
