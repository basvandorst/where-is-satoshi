It gets even better: Paypal just charged another 10% from the payment I received for my last auction.

"10% of the total amount of the sale
Maximum fee is $250"
Just paid exactly that fee...

Actually it seems to be even WORSE:
Just realised I have to pay 10% Ebay fees and Paypal just charged another 10% fee on the payment that was sent to me. WTF?! They must be crazy. Last time I used it.

Actually I sold something for $700 and was charged $70.10 - obviously the Micropayment fee. I am not sure what is Micro about $700 though... Might be a bug.

Not? I'm not a native speaker... Would "downright" be more appropriate?

That was my impression - brand awareness is what keeps eBay up there.

I wasn't aware they even forced Paypal onto sellers... Where I live you still have the option of wire transfer at least. Although I am not sure about larger sellers...

I agree with you for businesses. But in this case I was referring to eBay fees for private sellers.
Regarding advertising: I would be willing to pay for advertising at any time - but I don't see where eBay provides anything like good advertising. They live from their monopolistic market position - which of course is their good right to do. But at 10% fee + another Paypal fee I will think twice whether it is worth using it for private sales. Using it as a power seller with different fee structure and a completely different margin on your end is another beast.
Congratulations for your business - sounds like you have a nice margin there. For a business in the end it makes sense to take the best you can whether it is a sales channel or the highest price you can get out of a customer. I use Paypal for my business as well. But as a private person I consider their fees excessive.

Interesting, so my "feeling" for that language piece was not that wrong after all...
@_date: 2014-09-21 20:54:54
Thx for the explanation!

Interesting - will be crucial whether a solution to that problem is implemented for OpenBazaar from the beginning. Otherwise it might end in another grey market place...
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:03:10
Awesome! Will have to give it a try then.
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:35:41
Is there any ETA for an alpha or beta yet btw?
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:11:50
Right - in this case it cuts away the other 10% Paypal fee that somehow was charged (maybe a bug, not in contact with support yet).
But of course I was referring to projects like OpenBazaar as well.

Maybe tegknot has a point there with his advertising theory. Although I still don't think that advertisements make the difference for eBay. It is just the first thing everyone thinks off when it comes to buying second hand stuff.
