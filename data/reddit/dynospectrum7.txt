Well, my Alex Jones subscribing friend believes its due to the Rothschild family keeping the price low enough till it booms in price and they makes billions.

All of the other bs coins don't help and im sure if we had another silkroad type of exchange the price would jump back up. I'm being captain obvious here.

Yes. 2016. Hillary will accept Bitcoin donations for her campaign.

if silk road never went down who knows where it would be..

If the amount of money being invested into BTC doesn't keep up with the conception of the many coins every few minutes - I know others have probably said this already - price is not going to keep up. when silkroad was getting extremely popular, the coin was shooting into the sky.

Emails from Authy about Coinbase. I'll past the text. Can't format right now so sorry in advance.  
Dear Coinbase user,
We are notifying you because you currently, or have previously, used the Authy app to protect access to a Coinbase account. Due to a recent increase in sophisticated attacks targeting Coinbase users, we are taking extra precaution to protect your account.
In combination with social engineering and password theft, attackers are porting phone numbers (also known as SIM swapping). Once they fraudulently gain control of a user’s phone number, attackers can add new devices to an existing Authy account and take over access to a linked Coinbase account. 
To combat these attacks, we will be automatically disabling the Authy multi-device setting and limiting the ability to use SMS to install Authy.
Here are the steps you need to take:
* To avoid being locked out of your Coinbase account, please immediately install the Authy app on your current device if you have not already.
* If you need to install the Authy app on a new device, you will need to re-enable multi-device in the Authy app settings, though we recommend you disable it again after you have finished adding another device.
* Avoid sharing information regarding Coinbase or other bitcoin activity on social media.
* If you are still having trouble accessing your Coinbase account, please contact support
