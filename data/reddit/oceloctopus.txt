Unless I'm mistaken the total possible supply of bitcoins has decreased. People have lost, thrown away, or had their wallets destroyed. While means of preventing that have spread, doesn't change the fact that the supply of bitcoins is destined to decrease.

Not really. Personally I find it a bit hard to justify because it's a bit tainted, however irrationally, with the taste of human trafficking, which is kinda a rage button for me.
 I can justify it with dollars because it's the language of the land so to speak, but making an active investment into a market who's primary economy* is black is not really my game.
I follow them in the news because I find it technically interesting. 
^(*probably up for debate, but hey, I accept that not all my feelings are rational ones.)

The most useless* commodity in the world.
Even gold has industrial uses.

Just because its a static money supply doesn't mean it can't be inflationary/deflationary. 
I mean, on a short term scale, pretend Earl Y. Adopter found a bunch of bitcoins and decided to liquidate all at once. You get inflation.
On a long term scale, a fixed monetary supplies have a deflationary effect on expanding markets as the money can't keep up with demand. 
Also commodification of money(such as we're seeing now) causes hoarding, de facto deflation, which has a cooling effect on the marketplace. The only people spending bitcoin as a currency right now are idiots or drug dealers. 
The deflationary spiral has always been the specter haunting bitcoin.

Any black market in the world deals in human trafficking in one way or another, its just the way the world turns. Even areas with legal, regulated prostitution have the occasional underground sex slaves. 
[But]( 
^(Edit: Some actually argue that legalized prostitution actually increases human trafficking) ^[Link](

Murder weapons point to murderers by the nature of thumbprints, doesn't make them less.... uh... murder-y? Also, other cryptocurrencies base their entire nature around fixing the problem that those detectives exploit. 
That's why I also don't invest in gun manufacturers or defense contractors, despite how profitable they can be.  ��
Edit: I feel compelled to add that I fully support an individual's right to own firearms, just find that gun manufacturers and the NRA are sleazy dirtbags that currently exist solely to profit off of human misery.

meh, color me not optimistic about bitcoin as currency. I think its much more likely to continue to be a commodity until the speculation bubble bursts and people drop bitcoin for more useful cryptocurrencies.
I hope _you_ make it out good, because I bet a lot of people are going to wake up one day and find out their wallets have crashed in value.

Mmm, I'm not sure I agree with you. How can I, as a hypothetical fence sitter, trust you when you say the technology works? How do I determine it isn't a scam? A basic understanding of the mechanics is incredibly helpful.

Pretty sure Jim McNaughton counts as one of ["those conservatives"](
