There was a sell order on Gdax for 4000 BCH @ $4000. Needless to say, I ended up cutting my dick off and tossing it across the room when I saw that.

Sit on my face.

Gdax is not even working anymore. Its at a standstill due to the amount of traffic.

Sometimes I pay for people behind me in the McDonald's drive thru (pay if forward). But lately I haven't been able to pay for as many big macs as I'd like to. The economy is in shambles and my wife is taking the kids. Please contribute to my big mac charity fund. Sincerely, the dude whose wife took the kids and needs more of the money to buy others big macs.
