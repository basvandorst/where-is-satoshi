I don't see why all the down votes this man is absolutely correct
"Monetary stability of the US economy" was one of the more famous quotes that stood out to me are you fucking kidding me?
 if by that you mean running it straight into the fucking ground with almost no slope at all for the last 40 years that sure call that stability
your analogy couldn't be more spot-on the fat kid in the candy store promising the money is good the u.s. dollar is backed by literally nothing it used to be backed by silver now it's literally a fucking IOU a very quickly depreciating IOU
Many countries are getting out of it hundreds of countries no longer accept it with many more to follow 
for a fucking reason!
Our justice system is an atrocity
Our economy is almost non-existent
Our healthcare is well good luck
Our legislators have completely taken over making decisions only to fill their own pockets or that of their friends 
that is when they're not making decisions to militarize the fascist police by means of taking money and funding from the people who actually save lives like fire and EMS
how are so many people so fucking stupid to think the US government or economy is looked at by the rest of the world with any good regard?
sending a 250 million dollar plane that operates at a cost of $13,000 an hour to drop a 2.2 million dollar bomb on a bunch of people that live on less than a dollar a day
Oh yeah the rest of the world is just cheering from the stands
