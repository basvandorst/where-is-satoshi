i have added a few reasons in the post
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:30:04
I'm not angry, I'm sad.
I think a centralized company can be respected in a decentralized community. But coinbase has lost my respect.  
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:59:17
But coinbase knew about it months before and its been months since its been released. On dec 1, the coinbase ceo responded to a tweet saying hes looking for engineers to help with segwit intetgration. That is an unacceptable timeline for not even having a staff working on the issue. 
Being careful is one thing, but this seems like an agenda to clog the network as "innocently" as possible.

I love vertcoin!!!
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:16:37
Its only taxed if you sell the new coin for fiat. You are never taxed for just holding a coin. Only when you trade for goods or fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:40:16
i did not have to do this when i transferred. What bank are you using? BOA works just fine. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:53:02
This is pure speculation, but I predict they will be the last to implement lightning network when it does arrive. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:28:58
Not True. Other posts exposed me to evidence that led me to this decision. I am simply showing the community what my decisions are in an effort to promote what Bitcoin actually stands for, decentralization, censorship resistance, and community consensus. That is not what coinbase wants. I want show, through my actions, that someone can believe in something and make a difference, even if it is small.
Coinbase has lost my business because of their actions.  
If I wanted to karma farm, i would have used my actual reddit account, not my crypto throwaway. 
Thank you for your constructive input. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:57:49
i updated my post
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:44:25
Why? I just signed up for a debit card becuase i left coinbase/shift. Have i made a mistake?
Edit: i know they are a centralized company, but the wallet is in my possession and i have the keys. Im only using the card till everyone accepts btc. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:42:37
Its not that, every exchange has those problems. Its the secret agendas, insider trading, and obvious anti bitcoin sentiments from the higher ups in the organization. That is why i am leaving coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:27:41
Agreed

I have had good experiences with Gemini. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:51:04
i moved to GDAX then sent to my wallet. It was surprisingly quick. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:34:43
They all have issues yes, but all are not purposely anti bitcoin.

It has been too long. I cannot bear it any longer. At this point, I'm expecting them to disappoint me instead of impressing me time and time again. That is not a company I want to be involved with. I want to give respect, but I can not.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:15:44
Segwit is not the only reason i have left coinbase. The secret agendas and anti bitcoin stance is my main concern about Coinbase. From what i understand, [Gemini is ready to deploy segwit]( although im not sure what the hold up is...
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:21:51
Kucoin has some good stuff
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:23:08
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:36:43
Segwit is a blocksize increase. I believe, eventually, we will have an official increase as well. Just not now.
Every other coin would have the same problem if there was as much adoption and volume. 
Them being the largest means they should be leading the innovation of solving the issues.
Bitcoin is open source, anyone can contribute. They are not looking to solve a problem. They are looking to make money off whatever they deem profitable, not because of what a product can do for the world.
As i stated before, you can make money and do good. But Coinbase only wants one of those things.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:36:03
Your account has to be at 0 before you can close. I'd suggest withdrawing piece by piece till you're out. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:34:51
I know you won't believe me, but it is not about the gains to me. It's about what this currency can do for the world.
Bitcoin is the only one putting decentralization as it's  priority and looking to make it work for everyone who wants to be involved, despite how much money they have. 
I respect what Bitcoin is doing. I respect that they are sacrificing more on boarding and more money to ensure the security and integrity of the product.
Coinbase has proven the opposite and therefore, they have lost my respect. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:37:59
Yeah i hate them too, but it works on gemini. I hope to be off banks completely when this stuff is 100% stable. May be a few years...
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:41:55
Hahaha. This gave me chills. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:31:06
It is not helping the space now. In fact, [they are one of the reasons its being held back.](
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:40:00
It is not a bandaid. 
You are being willfully ignorant if you think a scalability upgrade and 2nd layers are a quick fix. 
Bitcoin is private and it was also the first of its kind. The vision has been there all along. You are only able to be tracked by the fiat/bitcoin or bitcoin/fiat transactions. Otherwise, its a guessing game on finding who you are. 
If you really are that concerned, use a great product like monero. The future will be a multi crypto world. I think btc will be the big one though. 
Stop the FUD, use the facts. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:35:41
What do you mean "nice try"? He is right, this is how you build a secure system that can hold billions and billions securely. Its the same outside of crypto. Take it slow, make sure it works correctly. Rome was not built in a day. 
Eth and btc are different beasts, and i am a fan of both. Eth will have growing pains, but it will grow. If you think his explaniation is not vaild, then you are being wilfully ignorant. 
However, this explaination does not guarantee Bitcoin's success. But personally, that kind of system is what I'd want to keep my thousands of dollars on. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:05:44
If you trade, yes, its taxable. If you aquire from the fork and hodl, It is not taxable, and when you do sell/trade, it's a 0 cost. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:17:30
You cant "change" it though. That just makes you not trustworthy.
I will not trust what you or your dad says at any point in time going forward.
I need all those stocks back please.

0x and radar relay. It's still in beta but it works. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:51:29
Look into what lightning networks will do. It is built just like TOR, privacy will be priority. 
Let me know your thoughts about it then. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:39:26
apparently they are segwit ready, but i don't know why they have not deployed yet...

Bitcoin is trying to replace banks. Not money in general.
I want a place to keep my funds free from anyone but myself and my family and transfer it without anyone's permission. 
 That is why i believe it will work despite government regualtion. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:18:45
There would be half the fee cost. I believe segwit cuts the tx size in half.
Segwit + Lightning + inevitable gradual blocksize increases = 1 coin to rule them all.

Tell me how?
And dont use that blockstream bs line
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:43:40
It will come, eventually. The 2x fork did not happen becuase of the way it was "proposed". im certain that the 2mb block increase will come in the near future when the community is behind it, not a handful of people behind closed doors. Hopefully it is agreed upon out with lightning. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:13:31
Just wanna say the Grinch converted in the end and turned into a good guy, yet we call all the no fun a-holes "the Grinch".
Shouldnt that be a positive comment now? Meaning someone who was rude before but now has changed his ways and is totally cool.

What are the downsides? Scaling and what not sure, but that is being resolved now with lightning.

Im hodling too bitch!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:56:58
No one has fixed anything with the other coins. Bcash merely moved the threshold, they did not progress anything. If volume was the same on btrash, it would have the same problem. 
2nd layer solutions that WILL scale are on the way for btc and eth. 
It takes time to build a castle, but we can live in it for generations. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:54:40
Why would Satoshi not like lightning? The white paper is not a bible. Im sure he/she/they were open to change and collaboration.

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:50:51
only if we scaled on chain
lightning could enable a crypto future, an all coin future with atomic swaps and full cross chain compatibility. anything is possible. 
I think bitcoin will prevail in being the best and most secure settlement chain.
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:11:08
They can open a channel with funds only on their side of the payment channel. Then payments could be routed to you over time. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:46
Everything dipped. It was not flowing out of bitcoin. It was flowing out of crypto. It will return.

@_date: 2017-12-26 07:04:42
Bcash cannot scale globally. It only moved the threshold of users while sacrificing node size and decentralization. It would do the same thing as bitcoin if it hit mass adoption. Look at what cryptokitties did to eth. That it why they want to do 2nd layers correctly, so they can scale.  Bcash is btrash. They have a CEO. How is that bitcoin? 
Also, Ver only repeats the same 6 things over and over. Come up with some new slander at least!!!
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:39:03
30 days is a pump and dump schedule.
If you're here to get rich quick, gtfo of btc. 
If you're here to scale the world and change it for the better. Relax and sit tight. Things will work out. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:22:57
Its made for dumping cause its was like an airdrop. Please don't buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:29:13
Are you sure you can "max out" a channel?
That is not how i understood it, but i am not in any place to state facts about LN. 
If that is true, why is it possible to max out a channel? Isn't a channel essentially a multisig wallet? You are able to have a regular wallet with unlimited btc, why would a multisig disable that? 
Edit: is it that you can't increase the amount of a "passive" channel? One that is purely in the middle facilitating the transfer? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:03:13
Did you defend the NSA as well? Jesus Christ. The "if you're not doing anything wrong" argument is all i need to hear to not listen to your opinions. Thanks.

If everyone follows this advise it will only encourage the bcash people with false volume.
Do not do this. Let it die as naturally as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:44:40
Why are they better? Lower fees and faster at the moment, sure. But how will they scale when the future is here?  When everyone in the world is using it, it wont work if its not developed correctly. 2nd layers are the only thing that can solve the issue. I can wait for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:57:43
But Bitcoin isn't about getting rich. Most other cryptos are. 
You have as much of a right to be here, but you dont have a right to set a 30 day deadline. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:51:51
Do you have proof for this? Im not trying to challenge this, i just want to back it up with a source when i use this in conversation.

The goal is about changing humanity. I know it sounds cheesey but its true.  Getting rich should be a by product. But getting rich quick is not part of bitcoin. Go get some pump and dump action if youre only in it for the money. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:10:28
Other manufacutures are getting into the game. The next few years should see some competition to bitmain. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:39:11
They have it, but not on the  GUI. You probably shouldnt use core as a primary wallet anyway since it is on network (hopefully as a node). You would keep a HW wallet and Trezor had segwit from the start, the core wallet had it in command line.
If you are using core as your primary wallet, then most likely, you are educated about security and have more advanced tech skills. These people would use the segwit command line form of the wallet. 
But yes, it should be on the GUI sooner than later. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:48:21
Hacks have not affected bitcoin directly. Fees and ease of use will come with 2nd layer, time, and education. These issues do not outway the benefits in my opinion.

@_date: 2017-12-23 22:28:21
Core is finished, they developed it.
Yes we do need segwit on core gui. But my point is lets focus on what matters.
Gui segwit vs LN is core's concern.
Segwit vs bcash is coinbase's for some reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:47:37
yes, but now there is no real incentive to run a full node. 
With lightning, you have the ability to charge fees (small fees) as a hub, and if someone cheats and your hub catches it, you get the reward of the cheaters channel funds.  
when you work a bit of game theory into the system, the growth of nodes could be exponential. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:49:30
I see your point, but this guy is just trying to spread adoption. Some stores will take bcash, its up to the communities to use the right coin. At least it's not listed bcore or some bullsh. 
Don't be so hard on the guy! Let the people dump some btrash for a grow kit!
@_date: 2018-11-24 07:02:58
pretty sure most everyone says not to invest more than you're willing to lose. 
also, you should have dollar cost averaged. 
and talking to people like that is not cool. why would you think that is effective?
and it's not a bean scam, it's a paradigm shifting combination of technologies that goes through speculative bubbles. this is well known throughout it's history. 
give your kids the btc for christmas and educate them.
also act like an adult and not an angry high school kid blaming others for your own mistakes. 
do better research. in 5 years see if hodling would be have been better.
and you still have money, just not as much. take it out if you think it'll go down. just make your own decision and stand beside it. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:47:19
How do you think individuals should approach bitcoin adoption with the general public?
Should they be those people who turn every conversation towards BTC, or just lurk in the shadows waiting to spread this intellectual contagion when "appropriate".
Someone described the fanatic bitcoiners as "technology vegans". This term made me self aware and now i'm not sure how to approach others about btc.
I'm interested to hear your thoughts
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:25:34
I agree, but this still helps adoption. As long as it’s not a bcash only option I’m fine. 
Other options will come up, and with the competition, an easy decentralized solution for out of touch merchants will arrive. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:23:00
You obviously do not understand the point of this technology. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:44:08
That will get you started.
But get a wallet that supports segwit. It will start with a 3. All you need to know about it now is that segwit is a Bitcoin upgrade that will lower your fees when you send BTC to others. 
You will most likely want to buy through an exchange. If you are really new, I would just use the Cash app on Apple or Goole play and purchase small amounts till you are comfortable with the whole situation. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:37:43
You do not understand what this technology is. It could fail, yes, but to think it's a ponzi scheme really shows your ignorance. Do some actual research and read more than just the headlines. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:26:52
Bcash is all about linear scaling. Bigger blocks equals more people using the blocks in their minds. The real innovation comes from finding different ways to solve the problem. Not the path of least resistance way bcash is scaling. 
Bitcoin will not work long term if there are no fees. What will the miners do when there is no minting/reward system? That is where the fees will go, they will support the system and its security by incentivising miners. They will never be free, but they will be manageable for the everyday user.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:20:47
You realize those are all features of the banks, not the currency? 
You could have a central bank provide all these things for you, but with bitcoin. It would not be the system I want, but it is possible. Centralized soultions can incorporate a decentralized product, but the fact you dont *need* the bank is the best part. 
 
To call it rubbish you must not actually understand this technology. Do some research on why it was invented in the first place. And if you still trust the banking system after that, have fun with that. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:32:13
This site treats bitcoin, satoshi, and the white paper as if its a religion. 
This is technology. Things develop and change. Because it is not exactly as satoshi said it would be does not make it wrong.
I believe in bitcoin. Not bcash. If they believe in their coin, that's great. Stop trying to make it a campaign against the other. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:24:02
Yes. When? is the question. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:24:06
But those projects take the tech from BTC and make small improvements. What will happen when one of those small improvements turns into an actual innovation? Will everyone flock to that chain or will BTC be able to absorb the idea and incorporate it into the Bitcoin protocol? My bet is on the latter, network effects are huge and 90% of the top talent in crypto are working on BTC. If someone else has a better idea and it's open source, BTC will continue to improve. Other coins do not have that working for them.
