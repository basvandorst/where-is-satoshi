Well said sir. Adoption as far as using it as a currency for transaction purposes has actually decreased (even though volume in trade between exchange rose up steadily, fueled by speculation) and as such BTC values is now getting more and more disconnected from its fundamental use as a currency as its value keeps on rising. But hey, buy now think later right?

This. And as the price of BTC rises, it fuels more and more power into ''securing'' its network, thus making it more and more expensive to use it. At least it has the kind of advantage of inducing a stabilizing effect to set a sort of soft cap on the price surges we're seeing.

Agreed. I'd say that in the specific use case of gpu mining, in a typical basement with few windows, 90% + of the energy will be used to heat the house. If not 99% +. Wind energy is allegedly negligible from the get go, as fans consume sub 10W while the gpu itself consumes 150-200W. This is added onto the fact that wind itself is constraint into a set of walls, which in turn means the initial stream of air particles will start to diverge around and end up as, you guessed it, heat (aka particles moving around in a random fashion way). For lighting energy, some will be loss through the window, but very little. And for the electricity powering the gpu itself, almost all of it will be converted to heat, while a small amount would go into vibrations.
All in all, I'd say a 99% + heat conversion is a likely scenario. 99.9% might be a little too much though.

At a given mining efficiency, you indeed need a higher share of the overall hashes produced globally to increase your mining income. Thus, you indeed need to put in more energy to find more coins, as a competing individual. Of course though, the total amount of coins created isn't function of the total energy consumed. But as BTC price increases, more energy is ''worth'' spending since every newly mined BTC is effectively worth more, thus enabling more miners to sustain a profit.

You are right in that innovation and risk taking behavior can happen disregarding the inflation/deflation level. One thing to mention though is that inflation/deflation **promotes/hinders** it. It's not a black and white kind of deal. It's rather a broad ranges of greys, shading from the white all the way to the black. A low rate of deflation certainly won't stop the most daring entrepreneur to bring their ideas to life. Nor will a low rate of inflation be enough to get a very low risk tolerance profile going into a risk risk endeavor. Again, to quote my previous post:


Keyword here is partly.
Another parallel can be drawn between inflation and threats to one's survival. In a high inflation, people's are threatened to lose face value on their currency. The rational response is to take a risk (whose level is dependent on one's tolerance to risk and the inflation level) and invest. That's just like when one put a gun on your head, you're pretty much willing to engage into the most daring endeavor just to stay alive. Or when war breaks out. It's sad to say, but more often than not, we humans need a kick in the butt to get going. And inflation is one of those actors going in to kick us in the butt.

Intelligent in what sense? For the disclaimer, I am myself holding on some BTC, yet I believe it is being overly valued right now. Actually, as a matter of a fact, the more BTC's are worth, the less efficient a currency it becomes since it promotes more people to ''secure'' the network, thus using more and more energy in the process. 
If Bitcoin truly favored the intelligent, I don't think those intelligent people would have jumped so recklessly into it to the point of reducing its usefulness of being a currency by a lot (look at steam and the dark net forums). Or perhaps we, as intelligent people, are trying to create a new purpose out of Bitcoin, to store value (and speculate on it being better at doing so in the future due a limited supply of BTC). Actually, I think we're not intelligent at all. I think we're straight up greedy. There's much better tangible ways to look at if one's goal is to store value. 
That leaves us with the speculative side of thing/big volume trade still feeding on BTC price surge.
Yet, the funny thing about all this speculative mania is that it'll most likely keep on going, since the interest rate on fiat are so low. Indeed, low interest rate promotes monetary supply growth, which in terms promotes inflation and higher risk tolerance in investment. Given just how high the stock market has soared up to, investors have been seeking alternative to where to make a profit in. 
Crypto has been one of those alternatives to look at and it'll stay that way **until debt do us apart**.

Interesting thought about the value of time, and the arrow of time. In which one that retains its potential purchasing power for longer is the wiser, just like one closed system that manages to somehow limit its entropic growth compared to another closed system is also the wiser.

@_date: 2017-12-19 06:15:07
Paradoxically enough, the higher the value of BTC goes, the more inefficient it becomes as a currency, due to higher relative fees. Also, the more mainstream it becomes (inducing higher volume), the longer one has to wait to get his transaction completed. At least it can still be considered a good store of value.

I'd argue that our current FIAT system promotes economic growth, via the ongoing inflation which promotes risk taking behavior (which is also resulting in the rise of BTC price, fyi). It doesn't need it. One simply gets better result by taking risks and trying to innovate than by staying idle, keeping his fund locked in a vault (on average). With BTC, this trend reverse. People are encouraged to hoard what they own, since its value is guaranteed to remain the same or increase via lost wallets and such (and that is disregarding changes in adoption level). Yes FIAT induces slavery, but guess what, slavery gets work done, for you and for others. Deflationary currency (like BTC) on the other hand induces laziness.
Back to your argument of


This is certainly true. Especially demographically speaking. Good thing FIAT do not promote exponential growth on their own. They strictly promote getting things done, at a varying level according to the inflation pace. And guess what, if we're to even maintain our current goodies we got to enjoy so much, we're not running short of things that needs to be done anytime soon. In that regards, an inflationary currency is helpful, whereas a deflationary one (like BTC) hinders the economic activity. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:19:55
How about you come to realize that these ''low fees'' are very detrimental to bitcoin as a currency. 
If you were to go to a shop and had to pay a flat 10$ additional on your purchases, I'm pretty sure you would turn back around and go at the competitor that doesn't charge these fees. 
Yet, I can see that the BTC is still in an advantageous position for high volume trading compared to most FIAT transfers, but as BTC price rise, one requires higher and higher value to be transfered via BTC to make it competitive vs FIAT. This is a concern that will hopefully be solved by LN.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:41:40
BTC on the other hand is a deflationary currency, which promotes saving instead of spending. Is that good for the economy, one may ask? 
Well it certainly won't help the velocity of money (in other word it will promote hoarding it) and it won't encourage risk investment (as people will be guaranteed to get growth out of simply holding on it) which in turn will cause an economic slowdown. 
Additionally, since there's a limited supply of BTC, the more mainstream it becomes and the more goods have to be traded to make it competitive relatively to the fees of FIAT solutions. Indeed, the higher the value of BTC goes (through the ''mainstream'' push we're seeing now), the more miners can be sustained to ''secure'' the market. But guess what, the more miners there is, and the higher a single unit of value traded will consume energy. Thus, the higher it costs to make a given trade. That also makes BTC a bad currency. Even more so given we're still VERY far from mass adoption, thus many magnitude higher of power could be thrown into ''securing'' the network if mainstream adaption fully completes. Needless to say, this has to change via LN for instance.
All in all, BTC as it is right now, makes for a very poor currency in my honest opinion. Let's hope it changes via LN introduction for instance.
In the meantime, for the disclaimer, I will keep on supporting BTC via my holdings in it, since it's one of the few ways I (and we for that matter) have to oppose to current banking system.

Sad, yet truthful. Though one needs to compare true fees level, which are the actual percent wise fees applied on the transaction like you calculated, plus the percentage of new coins created and sent to miners compared to the total coin supply. That let one knows just how much the currency lose its value to get it moving. (btw I'm too tired to do the analysis at this time, feel free to add it up).
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:42:23
It does encourage conservation, which can be a good thing for the sake of environmental issues and such. The problem arises in terms of what it does for businesses. If you have say 3BTC, you're guaranteed to get growth out of it (disregarding adoption level changes) by just holding on it. Whereas if you were to hold that same value in $, you'd probably seek to invest it, perhaps even starting up a company of your own and thus creating value for others while allowing capital less people to get engaged in the economic cycle by working for you.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:07:36
I've heard great things about lightning network, to say the least. I have a question for you regarding the impact of LN on the miner. 
Will it affect them in a positive, neutral or negative way? The way I see it (and correct me if I'm wrong) is that it would enable more micro-tx, while the block reward for confirming on chain tx would remain the same. Thus, per say, miners would get the same global reward via the BTC rewarded, and might eventually get more fees paid out due to higher volume on the market via the lower fees on micro-tx. So LN would actually be very beneficial both to BTC as the currency and to the miner.
 Is that right?
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:36:13
If one seeks to make an investment, BTC on its own serves no productive purpose. And so is money. Saddly, BTC being a deflationary currency, it encourages people to hoard it. Which is vastly counter productive, to say the least.

So are you saying there will be a side market for off-chain transaction where the BTC would be worth ''more'', while the price for on-chain transaction will see BTC price being lower?
That would actually make some sense, economically speaking, since it would be advantageous to use off-chain transaction, given the lower fees associated with it.

@_date: 2017-12-19 06:27:44
Or rather, BTC solving one less banking problems, one less at a time. When BTC was introduced, it was very competitive to buy pretty much anything with it compared to FIAT, like the famous example of that 10000BTC for two pizzas, charged only 1BTC in fees if I recall correctly. Today, if one tried to purchase two pizzas in BTC, he would have to pay around 20% in fees. And that percentage will keep on increasing as long as BTC values soar up. The goods news (or bad news) is that this mechanic will most likely help BTC price stabilize, as people become less interested in using it as a currency. On the other hand, this will also prevent widespread adoption, which is sad. 
The core problem in all this really is linked to all the energy being burned to secure the network. Indeed, the higher the value of BTC goe, the more miner can be supported via fees/block reward, which in terms means that globally, each unit of value traded via BTC is effectively consuming more joules, thus the increased cost to render a transaction possible.
Until that issue is solved, BTC soaring price (if it does keep going that direction) will rely more and more on its use a store of value/brand name/speculation and less and less on its actual use as a mainstream deflationary currency.
Food for thoughts.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:06:34
For the disclaimer, I'm myself an HODLERS.
If the economy went south, AKA GDP decreasing, that would in turn mean people would have reduced income, thus less to invest in BTC to keep it being fueled up. Also, for the HODLERS, the same income reduction would make them pressured into selling their BTC for FIAT since the latter is much more accepted (as of today) to pay their bills and such. 
All in all, in my honest opinion, BTC price would drop down dramatically in the event of an economic recession or the likes. 
People arguing for it being a store of value make a valid point in the sense that it's not inflationary, but there's much better store of value that have been ongoing since the dawn of civilization. 
Actually, to really come up to an answer about whether or not BTC price would rise or drop upon an economic recession, one has to wonder what is the average profile of a potential buyer and a potential seller. If the potential seller is someone burdened in debts, and the potential buyer is someone thinking about taking a loan to invest it into BTC, then upon an economic recession, my bet is on the BTC crashing. On the other hand, if the potential seller is someone just chilling (a.k.a. low debt/income ratio, high net income) and the potential buyer is also someone just chilling, then BTC will soar just fine. Hell, it might even see its value increase. The thing is, today's overall economic indicator points towards the first overall set of profile, which are fueled by the current low interest rate. 
Food for thoughts. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:53:49
That's a good metaphor! I mean, hypothetically, disregarding growth in ''adoption'', BTC's value would be linked to that of the world GDP since there's a fixed total supply for it. But its value as a currency is indeed dropping as its price keeps on increasing, just like a blocked drain is worthless compared to a fully functioning one.

As BTC valuation goes up, more miners can be supported which in terms leads to more power being consumed for a given tx/s rate. 
That paradigm means that the only way to keep the fees on the low side as the adaption is curving up is to increase the tx/s rate (via LN/segwit/blocksize increase). Otherwise, we're doomed to spend shitload of power on securing very few transactions, which is very inefficient.
