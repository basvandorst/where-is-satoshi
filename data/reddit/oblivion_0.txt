The stock is down along with BTC (understandably) but the NAV premium has been holding steady at 75%.  It has traded as high as 100% of the NAV (Dec. 18--the last day BTC touched 19k when it traded at 3500) and as low as near-parity with the NAV (Dec. 21--the last "big" crash when it traded at 1180).

Yes, but the NAV during that crash plummeted.  It hasn't this time.  There is something unusual about that.

On 7 days in the past month BTC ranged upward enough in a single day that, were it to continue on its present uptrend (who knows) it would finish today above yesterday's close.  I think that would require some of the hysteria about it going to zero to wane, though.  A little too much short-termism going on.  If it gained 1% a day for the next 60 days, it'd be cheek to jowl with 20k again.  I always use GBTC stock to take the temperature of bitcoin.  Currently trading at a 75% premium to the NAV.  That's pretty bullish.

We won't finish the day in the green sadly, but I think it's likely tomorrow will be green as heck.

For the people who keep saying "this is it" or whatever -- I point you to two things.  One, look at the charts.  There has not been a day where Bitcoin has dropped by this much and not retraced over the course of the following day.  Or check out the history of the 1929 stock market crash.  The market retraced after Black Friday, Black Monday, and Black Tuesday (check Wikipedia).  If the price of Bitcoin is going to fall, it's going to fall slowly over a period, not to zero in a day.  Check the price tomorrow or later today and see what I mean -- it'll retrace.  It could even potentially go on a bull run.  The fear mongering is so overblown.  But if you want out, and don't think it'll ever come back, at least wait for the retrace to sell. Jeez.

Gah!  It keeps going up! I want to buy! Please panic sell more :-(

It just seems so coincidental that the first CBOE futures settle on the same day as a huge crash.

Just an FYI:  Don't forget about the tax implications of your decisions.  I'm totally comfortable losing quite a lot just because of the tax offsets.  It may actually be a good idea to hold on and realize the losses in later tax years.  Obviously everyone's financial situation is different, but thinking of it as a tax offset on next year's taxes and the year after (and the year after and the year after ...) helps me through days like today.
