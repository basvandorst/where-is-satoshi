I just PayPal'd you a tiny fraction of 1USD to let you know how much I enjoyed this comment.
Someone from PayPal (please verify this transaction so everyone here knows that I just tossed a minuscule amount of spendable money at this guy.

It's a shame my local grocers aren't accepting Bitcoin. That's the only thing stopping me from... \*gasp\*  \*wheeze\*

If you don't ever look at the value of your Beanie Babies, then you haven't lost any money. Thus you've won the game. Keep your eyes on the field, not the scoreboard. Just keep buying more Beanie Babies. You only lose money if you sell them.

You can also save time by spending the dollars directly on the thing you were buying.

If he had that recording right now he could totally... um... prove his claim that he was quoted accurately?
Did he think the WSJ was offering him the chance to do bitcoin PR? They wanted to verify someone had lost thirty grand worth of coins. The fact that an exchange can run off with your coins with no consequences is a lot more interesting that how someone who's heavily invested in bitcoin wants to tell the world how much he believes in bitcoin.

It's all about today's subreddit theme: Entities That Have Laundered More Money Than Charlie Shrem.
You're supposed to look at this content and then ponder the UTTER INJUSTICE!!!!!

Um, as far as I know the victims of the Salem witch hunts weren't guilty of genuine witchcraft.

Tipping should be banned site-wide.
It's bad enough everyone panders to the hivemind for imaginary internet points. Having users crassly throwing money at one another isn't going to increase the quality of discussion one bit.

If you have $20k to store in insecure crypto, I *hope* you're rich.

Just like those stories where Robin Hood steals from the rich, waits for the rich to complain about getting ripped off, then gives back to the rich...
Nothing has ever been more fitting.

Because it reads like an impotent whine from a naive child who has no idea how journalism is done.

What product is Joe Bitcoin-Buyer investing in? Is the price of Bitcoins skyrocketing because everyone suddenly decided to buy their socks and groceries with convenient and anonymous crypto-currency?
I get the impression that people are buying Bitcoins because they expect the value of Bitcoins to rise. It's not like it makes much sense to actually *spend* deflationary currency. The only thing that makes the value rise is demand for Bitcoins. So, if demand levels off, then the value dips, then everyone sells, and the folks late to the game are left with a bunch of currency that's not worth the magnetic switches it's encoded on.
Aside from the lack of fraud and deception, it sure seems like a Ponzi scheme in practice.
The argument about how "it's not a bubble" are just... well, there really isn't an argument presented, is there? The author is saying "you can't prove it's a bubble, so it might not be."

"Yeah, but I was only going 0 mph in my driveway, so the net acceleration is zero: Not a crash."
