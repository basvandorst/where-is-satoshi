I'm comfortable buying/selling coins, the security not so much. He was really big into mining, pre-gox. We haven't been able to find any passwords book/list. This isn't that surprising as the man was literally a genius, he probably didn't need one. I have his computer and hope his wife hasn't cleared the cache. I'll check tonight. She has his cell phone but it was provided by his work and they shut off service. His Google authenticator shows a code for blockchain but we haven't been able to get in. I suspect anything there is inaccessible. Would blockchain work with his with to get in? The only proof is a death cert and there was a local news paper article about it. But I'm thinking we cannot prove he was the owner of that account. 
I'll search his pc tonight for a wallet or key. Along with any encryption software he may have installed.  His wife knows several of his passwords so there is some hope but we wonder about what we don't know. Additional email accounts, wallets stored online, ext.  He got really paranoid at the end.

Thanks for sharing. I could provide proof, but why.

Its too late for you to buy hardware and make money.  Only one person worldwide gets paid mining bitcoins every 10 minutes. Although "that person" may be a group of individuallys working together against eveyone else. To be that guy once a week you need to have a warehouse full of hardware mining 24/7.

Good luck selling those at that price.  I and some friends are just now starting up. As more of you leave there is still lots of meat on the bone for us little guys.  Your 50 ghs setup averages out to $1500 per ghs at $75000. I've built four 1 ghs rigs in the last month for less than $900 each. As you have used equipment I'd say getting 35-40k is not out of the question.  I am curious why you've lost faith in the market?  Is your power consumption of each computer eating your profit margin?  Did you make your investment back at least?

I got that same email today.  Bastards owe me WELL over $1000. I read this as a big FUCK you, wait another four weeks and we'll see if there is any money left...

Put the phone inside a ziplock bag full of rice overnight. The rice attracts Asians to come and fix your phone.
