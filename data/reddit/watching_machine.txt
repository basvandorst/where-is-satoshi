Wow those are like 25 bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:11:58
Fair. Just wanted to see where the %s come from.
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:00:31
Yes, but the fact that a specific public key is in use is not known to the network until it gets in a transaction. Would welcome any clarity on this.
Meanwhile, I googled and found this -

You're buying a legally permitted object and the credit card company is responsible for the safety of your privacy. Unless there is a request from law enforcement, I don't foresee a problem but I don't know your exact situation either. So you must do what you're comfortable with.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:53:08
This was my first severe drop too. I faced a different problem though - I'm sold on the fundamentals and in it for the long haul so when the price fell I got greedy and set limit buy orders, which started getting executed. Happy to get more Sats but got scared that I'm getting over-exposed to crypto in my portfolio. Never had this kinda panic for an asset class before. Live and learn!

I've tried to explore the ramps in India but I think there's only a few exchanges still braving it out. Maybe try them. I would've offered to buy and send you some but not only does it sound sketchy, but the fiat part of it will get complicated.
I do hope you can get somebody to sell you on LocalBitcoins. Let us know if/how you manage to buy.
@_date: 2019-11-19 02:47:06
Which breakthroughs are you referring to?
@_date: 2019-11-17 05:35:17
Unless you show people your wallet, i don't know how anyone would know.
@_date: 2019-11-09 15:35:07
Congratulations! I don't trade, but I'm curious how trading helped you. Do you have a trade memoir/blog describing the trades you took and why?
@_date: 2019-11-17 05:45:33
Yes but the vulnerability, to my understanding, is because of the usage of public key, and not the private key.
@_date: 2019-11-17 05:34:32
A hardware wallet never shares the private key with the computer, so even if your PC is hacked, the hacker will never get to see your private key. Another great security feature is the hardware wallets can display your addresses on the in-built screen, so you can verify that the address you copy pasted in your send transaction is the correct one.
As a side note, people suggest using a single address only once for sending BTC, my limited understanding is that this is because when you send BTC, you expose your public key to the world. This may totally not be right, but the general advise is to discard addresses after 1 use.

My concern with buybacks are that they're predominantly made by companies with expanding debt in balance sheets. They're borrowing to buy back shares and provide returns to existing shareholders because of cheap financing. But debt built up this way always outlasts the era of cheap financing. What happens to these companies then?
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:59:02
Do you have an article/survey on this?
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:07:03
But if another algo was that much better and made sense for all stakeholders, wouldn't Bitcoin get a protocol update or a fork at the very least to get that advantage?
@_date: 2019-11-23 03:35:43
I've withdrawn from Coinbase Pro before and it seems like once you want to move to an external wallet, you, rather than Coinbase, have to pay the miner's fee. Am I doing something wrong?
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:39:10
I see your point about market being more complex than just waiting for the demise. Generally, I am still of the opinion that most people with money aren't even looking at BTC, let alone have a strategy for getting in. I speak for humanity though, and not just developed economies.
What drives your fundamental analysis to be bearish on BTC? I have analysed most other assets and have a bearish attitude on then for short to medium term. Crypto, cash and PMs being the exceptions.
Also, in the absence of options, how do you short BTC?
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:32:02
Always ask yourself - do I possess the private keys to that wallet? Your keys, your BTC. Not your keys, not your BTC.
Robinhood allows you to trade BTC, but it's not meant to give you custody of your BTC. I assume it basically holds some BTC in your name on its own ledger (not on BTC Blockchain) and tranfers that ownership internally when you sell. If Robinhood goes down, you will not be able to prove your ownership or worst, your funds may be at risk of bail-in of some sort.
Get a software or hardware wallet, buy on an exchange and transfer them over if you want to hodl.
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:47:42
He's saying that your base is the starting point, not the ending point. You should be using 18k in the denominator.
(6k -18k)/18k = -66%
If something drops 100%, it literally is zero.
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:18:52
Define 'safe'. Robinhood doesn't really give you Bitcoin, it just gives you price exposure to it. Just like GLD gives you price exposure to gold but you don't really have gold if you buy it.
As long as Robinhood stays afloat and market conditions are normal, you should be able to get your money. But if you ever want to actually take possession of your Bitcoin, you will need to sell the claims you have on Robinhood and use that money to buy Bitcoin on some exchange.
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:39:00
And who's issuing the decree in BTC?
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:25:32
Interesting take, and a question for you - are the masses betting on BTC to rise or fall? With the current level of participation in Bitcoin, and the general ignorance/ apathy, I was under the impression that most money in the world is sitting out on Bitcoin, and by not being long they're actually, in a way, waiting for the demise.
In that case, wouldn't your cobrarían approach suggest going long?
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:46:33
I understand that permabulls appear dogmatic and cult-ish. Sure, everyone should be a rational investor and deal with this sanely. But markets are run by the animal spirits.
Even if we believe the bear outlook, that $20k was the lifetime ATH for Bitcoin, that we will never see it rise above this, I would still continue to DCA and HODL as long as the system has man and machine brainpower. I put in a small but meaningful amount, and if it goes to zero, so be it. On the upside, it's a disruptive investment, on the downside, is my silent protest against the system.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:51:05
The deflationary effect of Bitcoin is conditional on acceptance as money, or even store of value. Just because $ is inflating doesn't mean the cost of pagers is going up. Bitcoin will have to maintain relevance in the monetary conversation for the digital gold thesis to hold.
But don't let the above paragraph give the impression that I am bearish on Bitcoin. I'm not. Hence my point that the risk is asymmetric to the upside. But it never hurts to see the opposite view and assess the impact of any mis-assumptions you're making. I feel the more bullish you are on an investment, the more you should listen to the bears to see what you're missing.
@_date: 2019-10-14 09:04:39
Just crossed borders with both in equal value. Not an issue so far.
@_date: 2019-10-15 07:27:28
If you do have a 10,000 times more gold, you're basically rich enough to make that money move one way or the other. People forget that gold is incredibly dense SOV.
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:33:50
Interesting perspective- but isn't this predicated on you being able to successfully time the market? I for one have a hard time understanding how to time the market, hence I thought the only price I can control is my own buy and sell price. Hence going for DCA and rebalancing seems more rational than speculatively timing the market. What do you think about that?
@_date: 2019-10-12 14:01:42
... so are you agreeing with me about the hyperinflation part?
@_date: 2019-10-11 05:22:34
Hear hear!
@_date: 2019-10-14 09:05:22
@_date: 2019-10-08 06:05:49
Still think DCA is the way my dude. You may be right, you may not. But DCA keeps good either ways as long as the fundamentals are good.
@_date: 2019-10-08 16:18:01
Think of it as an option. Having cash gives you the right but not the obligation to buy BTC at future prices. Now, if I knew BTC is gonna double tomorrow,  I would lever as much as I could and then go all in. But there's no such thing as a free lunch.
In reality, there's an unknowable probability distribution of future BTC prices, and your perception of that probability distribution drives your actions. In my view, over the short term, the distribution looks skewed to the upside but still far from risk-free. Over the long term, I see a lot more upside and a lot less downside (hence I am accumulating and HODLing). Having an option gives me mental peace, keeps me on track, reduces the chances of a particularly bad entry point over the short term. That way, I can keep being objective, focus on long term and avoid any undue panic.
And in case this all seems too psychological and less financial, remember most investors make less than the investments themselves because of emotions and hunches. A mental hedge is no different than a financial hedge.
@_date: 2019-10-11 04:24:32
What is  as per you?
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:49:47
Yes but you don't need $25B to enter the market for the market cap to move by $25B. Just saying.
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:49:25
DCA is also a great mental hedge. Prices go down, you feel happy that you'll be getting a bargain. Prices go up, you feel happy that the investment is doing well. Prices don't do anything, you see money, just in some other currency. No panic selling, no FOMO buying.
@_date: 2019-10-12 04:45:33
I'm having some trouble reconciling this with hyperinflation. This, to me, seems like more of the same - buy financial assets, inject liquidity. Will see have acceleration in the increase in inequality? Yes. But is the money actually reaching the people? No. Is this helicopter money? No. Is the velocity of money going to increase? No.
Want to understand the weakness in my understanding here. Not trying to shoot down the idea. But the entire reason we're here is because trickle down economics does not work, and assuming inflation will rise because of QE is believing in the trickling of wealth to the have nots who will spend it.
@_date: 2019-10-08 13:08:04
You're saying that people should only average down, which is one way of looking at it. But that involves knowing for sure BTC price is going up, and anchoring yourself to your own previous buy price. It's called the anchoring bias in investing, and it leads investors to make irrational choices.
If BTC price goes up, yes you pay more per Sat if you're DCAing. But you're also buying less Sats at that higher price. Over time, you end up buying more when its lower and less when it's higher.
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:34:56
I thought the curves steepened again. That's why I mentioned getting bullish on the economy.
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:48:19
They do, but those funds aren't used to invest and grow. They are drained for spending. The SS program has been running deficits for quite a while.
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:56:18
If they don't inflate the money supply, governments will not be able to spend as much as they want and service the debt at the same time. Even though RE acts as a hedge, that's just an asset class. The amount of currency in circulation *has* to go up to meet the total liabilities of the state. That's why inflation is mandatory.
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:58:59
This exact reason is why I always recommend people provide a reference on purchasing power terms i.e. $100k in *today's* money. Inflation is mandatory in the current paradigm, which means a hyperinflation is always around the corner.
@_date: 2019-12-15 06:49:01
Bitcoin sometimes acts risk on, sometimes risk off. In a crisis, I expect Bitcoin to sell off just like any other asset in a firesale. But in a highly inflationary environement which the money printing will someday lead to, Bitcoin should preserve and enhance its status as a store of value.
@_date: 2019-12-17 04:08:33
What is the reason for you favoring RVN?
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:00:29
Except that the world's central banks are divesting from USD reserves and buying gold hand over fist.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:07:49
Probably hinder the ramps. But I'm more and more certain that the future of money involved sovereign currencies competing with non-sovereign ones.

The road of HODLing is not easy, and there are no guarantees. The best we can do is build frameworks like the S2F model and hope for the best
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:40:51
If it was true that we the people could terminate a bank, many banks wouldn't be around today. Central bank policies are decided by unelected officials in most parts of the world. We the people are as powerless to do all this in the current system as we can be. Bitcoin, or any other decentralized censorship resistant system, offers an escape to the oppressed. Check out the new Greek war on cash for example. In fact, leaving aside a few developed countries, the common masses throughout the world are subject to inflation and financial friction.
@_date: 2019-12-12 05:37:02
What, in your opinion, is the Central Banks' equivalent in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:11:59
Nope. Social security, Medicare, and all the other unfunded off-balance sheet items.
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:07:33
Yup it is, but people never take Sat/ounce ratio. They always wanna talk $$$
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:25:05
Many articles on it. Sample - 
I think yield curve talks more about perceived economic strength, which might make you bullish on financial assets, rather than the currency itself. Currency wars are a related but separate topic in my head.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:59:02
The lows measure the strength of hands. Higher lows mean HODLers' convictions are high. Anybody will come in when the price is rising, and most fools do come chasing short term gains. The "faith" in the system is however measured by the people who are long, and that's what is going to decide Bitcoin's worth as a monetary asset.
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:43:27
Yes, if they can. They will spend bad money and keep good money. That's why in happy to be in BTC. The investment seems a lot safer if the question is not if, but when.
And hopefully the protocol keeps improving over time too.
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:42:21
I think the word "decentralized" is used to imply the architecture. Yes, there is one ledger. Yes, there is one protocol. But there is no central actor without whom the system fails. *There's no central point of failure.* Hence, it's decentralized.
@_date: 2019-09-21 05:11:40
I think one interesting idea floating around is that as the tech progresses, we will need to upgrade security for the wallets. And in case of defunct accounts, wallets will not be updated and will be prone to new attacks. And so there will be the spawn of the bounty hunting industry which will focus on finding weak wallets in the network and claiming their funds as bounty.
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:06:47
Okay. You mind if I ask something here then?
I have been doing this for two months now, and given that the price remains stable, I find my crypto allocation keeps growing as a % of the portfolio.
I don't want to invest more than a small % of the portfolio in case the ride gets bumpy. Have you found a way to pace it in such a way that you benefit from the dips yet don't go too much in?
BTW I don't mine.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:17:46
I believe it was two *slices* of pizza :P
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:35:15
Deflation is great for savers and not great for borrowers. Usually, the biggest borrower in a country is the government. Which is why governments prefer inflation, so they can inflate away the debt.
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:27:07
This fit what I do to the T. I'd like to connect on PM with the OP if they're open to it. :)
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:28:14
Thanks for replying! I do understand scammers have made us all a cynic so I completely understand.
I came into Bitcoin world from the macro POV - it just makes sense to hold hard assets in a world of infinite soft money. But I see BTC means different things to different people, and am glad it helped you through the dark times. HODL on comrade!
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:37:52
I don't believe that investments and savings should be equated. Saving involves no risk in a sound money system (you are basically accumulating surplus value for future consumption), while investment always entails some risk. Any investment.
And by sound money I refer to any money that maintains it's purchasing power in real terms.
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:50:06
You're referring to physical risk, yes? That somebody robs your home? I agree that it's there. I was talking in terms of monetary value. Imagine if inflation is guaranteed 0%, then if you save $ bills, you are assured of what your future consumption looks like even without having to invest (i.e. lend out in some way, shape or form) it in any way.
In an environment where sovereign debt is already yielding negative in growing amounts, misratings are commonplace, and the only thing keeping the markets up is a guarantee of more easy money, investors are taking risks they would not have taken in any other time for unenticing yields. And while nominally one can do quite well, the real purchasing power can erode quite fast.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:07:51
The same argument can be made for precious metals e.g. gold. Not we know it doesn't go bad with time, so all that you're doing when you buy a good futures contract is defraying the cost of storing and insuring it. But that can be done by trading ETFs as well! Also, fully allocated gold storage vaults can easily do title changes so trading can be effective and efficient.
My guess on why crypto futures exist is the same reason why gold futures exist - easy use of leverage. You can lever up in cash and speculate of the price of BTC, just like you would on gold or wheat. And for cash settlement, you don't actually need the good to settle.
What this does is gets the traditional traders more involved in speculative trading of crypto without having to bother with the tech. On one hand it brings adoption, on the other it brings in short term ownership. It's a mixed bag.
