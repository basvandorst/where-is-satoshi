I found that when trying to restore to another wallet as a test! Was a bit confused. This explains it.

Thanks for the clarifications.  Would the extra word capability be part of BIP39?  (It did not seem like it from what I understood).  Or is it something that's very Electrum specific?
The extra word/s would be something that's an years long inside joke between my wife and I.  Something that will only ever be lost should be both pass away.  I would backup a hint with the seed.  It's maybe not the most secure thing, but adds a bit of extra security to just the seed phrase on a piece of paper.

Now that's clever!

Thanks, this is great info.  The extra word would be a bit like a "last barrier", so I won't rely on that solely and try and keep my seed words as safe as possible.
I'll look at switching to a BIP44 wallet rather.

Thanks, I think that is exactly what I'll do.  I'm pretty sure Electrum won't disappear, and it's open source, but sticking to a standard just means one have more options down the line.

I was not planning on storing it in some obvious format.  Was more thinking along the lines of encrypting it first and then splitting up the file and then uploading that to some cloud storage.
Thing is, in my country there are not many safe places where I can store it physically, to be honest. (computer hardware gets stolen a lot, safes broken out of walls - maybe I can dig a few holes in the garden...)
A hardware device could work well - but I would like to have some backup storage that I can access world wide.
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:23:55
That's why I'm asking. Duh.
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:27:53
Ok, but this means I need a piece of software (like what you mentioned) that can "unlock" my key/s by using said mnemonic, or passphrase.
How do I know I can trust "the software" any more than other methods?

Thanks for the reply.  If I do the backup, I expect to use it as long as it takes to do my trip (two to three days at most).  Once "on the other side" I will create a more secure wallet and move it over there.  I will also encrypt the already encrypted file.  I always use a long memorized passphrase as password when encrypting something like this, so at least it's not just an easy to guess password.
I any case, it's not a huge amount of money, so it's not worth it to do two trips.
Part of this question, is for me to gain more knowledge so that IF one day it's worth a lot, I know how to keep it safe.
The three devices are my phone (Android) a Windows (yikes!) 7 machine and a Windows 10 machine.
None of these devices really "interact" with each other.  I also took care to never type the passphrase in full anywhere and tried to use the dropdown and mouse as far as possible in Electrum to select the words.
The passphrases also use "extra words" which are not written down anywhere and which I remember, so even if they find my paper with the mnemonics, the extra words are somewhat of an extra barrier.

No problems. I've learnt that written text does not always convey tone, and that it can sometimes come over more rude than intended. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:41:47
Aaah, ok, that makes sense.
@_date: 2018-10-01 10:08:17
I used the "extra words" option of Electrum, and those are not written down anywhere.  I know it's a fairly weak final barrier, but it is a final barrier nevertheless.  So even if someone discovers two of the noted down mnemonics, they will still have to brute force the extra words.
And, as noted in another of my replies, it's not (yet?) a shitload of money.  I'm planning to hang on to this and add to it over the long term.
Maybe one day it will be a shitload of money, but by that time I would have arrived in my new country and have stored it in a less insane way.
Due to time constraints, my current country's absolutely unreliable postage service it's not practical for me to get a hardware device just yet.
This is a short term solution to move a not that valuable wallet from one country to the other.
It's also part of educating myself on what the best way is to store bitcoin if in the future it becomes more valuable.

I figured the android wallet cannot be backed up. I have a backup of my keys, so the wallet backups are an extra precaution for the travel time.  I will backup the two windows wallets and encrypt them a second time just to make sure.  I'll maybe make an extra backup of the android mnemonics somewhere. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 05:58:07
Honest question : why do we trust the manufacturers?  I currently run an airgapped Linux machine for signing and my keys have never been on anything else than that. I'm contemplating getting a hardware wallet for convenience, but it just feels dangerous to plug that into a networked windows machine at some point for signing transactions.

I get those basics (so maybe ELi10?) - but what I don't understand is that "where the orders meet" is less than 10 US cents apart from each other.
The person wanting to buy BTC can literally bump his order up  $0.1 and "eat" the sell order above his buy order.
Usually there won't be much volume "at the meeting point".  Here a significant volume is at the meeting point.  And the spread is not enough to even cover fees percentage wise.
