What were the further measures they mentioned in the article? The only action the original article mentions of taking is: 


Which is already in place on every single major exchange. It also says: 


Which again, is in place on almost every single major exchange, and has been for years. Major exchanges have been required to co-operate with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing for years which is the exact reason you are required to entire personal details and send ID when trying to buy/sell bitcoins. 
As SkylarkV said above, they have no data whatsoever and your entire post is doing nothing but attempting to create FUD/gain yourself some karma.

Weak hands cash out. If you're thinking about cashing out then you obviously don't appreciate the motive behind bitcoin and it's technology but instead care about fiat gains. In which case, I would advise you to sell and let someone else who has long term belief in bitcoin buy the coins, and thus the massive gains which are to come.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:23:51
Please, don't day trade based on time zones and timings. It's a recipe for disaster. If you're always buying at the same time you're bound to have days where the price drops after buying, there's no chance that the price follows the SAME trend everyday with regards to timings. 
If you're day trading: it's risky. I'll tell you that much. You need to look a lot deeper into bitcoin other than just time of day. There's a lot of other factors that affect the price, time itself shouldn't play a role on the price of coins. Anyone can buy bitcoin at any time, anyone with a lot of coins/money can buy/sell and affect the market hugely at any time. 
If you're holding: Sure, set up a daily/weekly buy order at the times you think are the lowest (do your research!) and you'll get your coins at the cheapest times. Sounds like a good way to dollar cost average, but again, I wouldn't rely on time of day to dictate your purchasing/selling. You need to be flexible and ready to buy/sell (if you're day trading) whenever it's needed.

Zzzz. Did you read the posts/original Guardian article before posting to karma-whore/create FUD? 
Basically everything they say is already in place on all major exchanges. You need ID to purchase BTC on almost all big exchanges already. The 'crackdown' is going to have very little impact on anything and is a precautionary measure that the gov. are taking. All they're saying in the original Guardian article is that exchanges and buying/selling BTC will need ID and proof of person etc. Which is already the case for almost all of the large exchanges. 
The article you've linked explains nothing to do with what the actions the governments are looking to take and merely says they want to crackdown and then proceeds to explain all the ways people can be criminal with bitcoin. 
Quality shitpost.

Because the timing is extremely convenient. They've obviously been working on it for a little while as they can't just add it instantly. Ripple is currently the same market cap as BCH was a few days ago. So shall we see if Ripple is added to coinbase in the next few weeks? I can almost guarantee it won't be.

Newcomers also need to stop branding them 'crashes' when BTC goes from $9000 to $11500, then back to $9500 over a 3 day period. It's still an upwards trend, we're still rising over time.

Gotcha. Thanks a lot for explaining, appreciate it :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:28:06
Simple answer is: 
Is the amount of BTC you own worth losing over $100? Is it worth spending $100 to ensure your coins are safe? 
If you've got $120 in BTC, there's no point spending $100 on a wallet. If you've got $1200, it's definitely worth spending $100 to ensure you don't lose $1200. Rather spend $100 to keep BTC secure then cheap-out and regret losing all your money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:39:49
So if I ONLY trade in crypto and never exchange for USD I don't have to pay tax correct?
So regardless of how much $$$ I exchange between currencies, as long as I don't withdraw to bank I won't have to pay tax?
Apologies for so many questions, I don't want to end up exchanging then getting burned by the feds for not paying tax when I didn't know I had to!
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:53:42
Waiting for a dip isn't a wise idea. You'll kick yourself if you wait for the next month and the price doesn't go down, and ends up being 15k+ by New Year. At the end of the day bitcoin is rising, and as we're at a current ATH, if you'd have bought bitcoin ANY DAY before today you'd have made a profit. 
Don't get overly greedy. To try and save yourself $3k and hope the price drops to $10k, you might burn yourself more and we end up getting to $15k and that's the new floor. Then you end up costing yourself an extra $2k/coin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:44:11
Growing pains are great but suck at the same time. Not great for people who want to get on the Bitcoin train for a start, if they want to start with $100 and get hit with $17 fees they won't be happy.
I wish us early birds had special seats, I miss when you could actually send transactions within minutes. I'm happy to wait it out and I don't mind paying fees but like...it's a pain when you pay the fee AND it still doesn't confirm anyway. It's like a double low blow!
Eh, I'll get over it I don't mind waiting too much as long as I know roughly when it'll be done, I can just see how this kind of thing can become a pain for people and push people away from Bitcoin and we really don't want that. In a time when adoption is growing so fast we really need transactions to be going through faster, I know there's nothing that can be done but it's frustrating!

Pay off your credit card, keep the rest. This way you keep yourself debt free and then you don't need to worry about losing the rest. 
Pay your card off so you're at $0. Then, all bitcoin gains are a bonus, putting you into the green. I wouldn't put yourself in debt over it because though it BTC has massive long term prospects, you don't want to be in a situation where it crashes and you get yourself into real world issues. 
Pay your credit off, then re-buy your BTC over time with money you have spare via dollar-cost-average. This way, you have no debt, your credit is paid off, you have the remainder in current savings in BTC which you can watch increase (hopefully) and then you slowly acquire more BTC overtime so you're prepared when we hit $100k :)

@_date: 2017-12-04 01:32:05
Why does it matter?
If the few that control most of the coins are holding, that's a good thing, they're restricting a huge amount of coins being supplied whilst the demand increases which helps the price rise. There's almost no negatives to them having a lot of control of the coins themselves.If we didn't have these big players in the market to buy and hold coins for the future, there would be a hell of a lot more coins on the market and the supply would be higher, meaning a lower price.
If they're not holding and are trading, they don't control most of the bitcoins. They just have a lot of fiat to pump in, as does anyone in the entire world with a lot of money, which includes 15.3m millionaires. In which case you could say 'anyone else bothered by the fact there are 15.3 million millionaires in the world that could buy lots of bitcoin right now?' in which most people would reply 'I wish they would!'

@_date: 2017-01-15 15:25:00
Totally agree. There should be someone/company/subreddit where people analyse codes for the latest updates and say they're safe to carry out or something. Pretty sure the vast majority of us with Trezors don't know how to read code in such a way that would tell us if there was an issue.
@_date: 2017-01-15 15:23:58
But what if they plant a code in the FW that doesn't steal coins until there is X million coins scores in Trezor wallets world wide? And they swipe all the coins at once? 
I know you say it's open code, but I never see anyone analysing the code, posting about how the next update is safe or whatever. With Trezor you can't even use the MyTrezor wallet unless you do the latest update, and there's no Trezor reddit or anything where someone analyses the code and says its safe to update etc.
I understand it's pretty much as safe as things will get, the whole idea just makes me quite paranoid. I want to be in this for the long term but I just feel there's so many different things that could go wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:28:44

Coinbase is one of the largest and most accessible exchanges. The majority of new investors outside China (bare in mind China are asleep) will use coinbase as it's a well known and trusted exchange.

For everybody? 
If there's no liquidity then the supply is lower, resulting in increased price provided the demand stays the same, which is good for those holding. If liquidity is increased and the demand for BTC doesn't increase in accordance to, price lowers.  Liquidity is only good those again, those who treat bitcoin as stocks and need to be able to buy often.

@_date: 2017-01-03 23:14:20
Yes, but by selling your coins you increase liquidity and encourage the price to fall. By doing so, those same people in the world who are having a 'hard time' in developing countries and HAVE invested into BTC are now losing money because people in the developed countries and using BTC as a stock to make a quick buck. If instead of selling your BTC on the margins, you hold your BTC, all those who are having a 'hard time' and have invested in BTC will see the prices rise and won't be having a hard time because they'll all become rich by having a little faith and not letting short-term greedy profits get to them.

Good point but there's no single person controlling all of the miners in China. 'China' as a country can't just shut down all miners and stop solving the whole blockchain, and this also wouldn't have an effect on coinbase going out/volume levels.

If I'm interpreting this correctly, I believe I'm right in saying there is huge support between $700-$750. If we're looking at the graph for bids (bids is the amount that people will auto-buy at because they have set orders in, so for example, at $750.01 there needs to be 467 {$3.6m USD} coins sold for the price to drop to $750).
We can see there is an absolutely massive sell blockade/wall around the $750 mark with 1200 coins needed for the price to drop from $750.01 to below $750. Meaning there will be huge resistance for the price to lower below $750/$700. From this we can see that unless there is a massive panic sale, or dump (which is unlikely because all the panic sellers are likely to have already sold) the price is unlikely to fall a massive amount
Onto the asks (like bids, asks are the orders for buys on bitcoin. When the price hits X amount, the coins are automatically bought. If I have a bid at $770 for 10 BTC, when the price hits $770, I automatically buy 10 BTC at $770 regardless of whether I'm awake, asleep, or dead) - We're looking at around 500~ coins for the price to rise from $760-$772. Referring back to the bids, for a $0.01 drop, we needed 467 coins to be SOLD. For the price to RISE $12, we only need 500~ to be BOUGHT. 
~500 coins sold, $0.01 drop
~ 500 coins bought, $12 increase
Looking roughly at it, it looks around 30k coins or so for the price to rise from $757-$834. Not unlikely baring in mind that's almost an $80 increase in price, over 10% in only 30k coins. 
What I'm trying to say here is hodl. In the time I've written this the price has risen almost $20. There is HUGE resistance for the price falling around the $750 mark in comparison to the resistance of the price rising up and above $800.
As anticipated, price has risen ~$30 since writing this.

Well aren't stop-losses basically what bids are? 
Stop-losses are the price at BTC will be automatically sold at if the price hits that amount.

I feel as if this move is more natural than the last. The last was a huge hype bubble, that spiked and burst very quickly. 
This on the other hand is a longer term, (more) steady increase that is a result of an abundance of factors. 
If you were to invest now it's quick likely you'd end the month having gained profit. There's several factors that will continue to push up the price of BTC over the next month. 
China high purchasing volume - new tax year, all Chinese citizens now have the $50,000 limit to send abroad so can invest in more BTC (likely the reason for the current hike)
Close to equivalent to price of one ounce of gold (~$1163) so enticing new investors
Close to all time high, mass media coverage and further increased price.
If the price continues to rise as it is (bare in mind the current spike is whilst China {the highest purchasing volume of BTC} is asleep, they wake up in 5-6 hours) throughout the next day or two, then it's likely we will see $1250 by the end of the week.

Isn't it really ironic that you're complaining at me for something you're doing straight back? Stop expecting people who want to invest in an online currency and who care about the price to do no research and be hand fed. You wouldn't go to wall street and start asking everyone why the stocks are changing prices. If you cared that much you'd spend some time researching it yourself.
Oh, by the way... you're making yourself look emotionally unstable by typing me up a paragraph complaining about telling someone to simple **use the internet**.

Trying to get rid of these shitcoins but Bittrex are shafting me with verification. Not really sure what other sites to use :(
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:14:10
A lot of people will do. It's a BTC subreddit, it's better to spread some positivity and shed light on the issues at hand than let all this front page FUD scare people away from BTC.

Why did anyone buy at $1k when it was ATH? If you bought any day before today and it was the highest ever was it a bad decision? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:29:41
Do you know about bitcoin? There's not going to be a snowball effect after dropping like 7% when bitcoin is up like 20-25% this week. 
If you think 7% is enough to cause a snowball effect in bitcoin then you need to do some more research.
Obviously not a snowball effect if it dropped $800 then climbed another $400 within 5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:55
This guy is just trying to create FuD, ignore it... Look at his posts, he's been posting that there's going to be a correction down to $3k.
There was a flash dip of like $800, the price is already back up like $400 since you posted it. Someone obviously just dumped a lot of coins. 
Don't invest if you have weak hands, if a $1k drop is too much for you to handle you're in the wrong market. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:11:11
I am patient. Shitcoin has gone from $300-$1500... Waiting until the price hype has gone down is a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:47
We're down 1% in the last 24 hours. There's nothing to recover from.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:00
Recover..? 
The price is still higher than it was 2 days ago, what're we recovering from?
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:12:52
This is the kind of thing that needs to be front page. There's so much FUD being spread around reddit/forums and something like this is bound to clear all the fear up and settle peoples minds. 
The more people that realise this is just one big scheme for the rich to make some money and try and take control, the faster we can get out of the dip and get back to supporting the currency we love. 
If everyone calmed down and relaxed about the slow transactions then the miners wouldn't have anything to hold against us. When people start fearing slow transactions and high fees the power gets pushed further in the direction of the miners (...and China) and they have more room to exploit.

Because currently if you ask people why the price is going down, all they can recite is FUD they’ve heard about India. They’ve done no research themselves, but they’re happy to sell because they saw it on reddit and the price is red, therefore it must be bad news and time to sell.
Realistically at the current time, nothing substantial has happened. Not enough to cause the price to go from $20k to $8k in 2 weeks. Bitcoin hasn’t lost half of its usability. In fact it’s become more usable as the price has dropped.
At $19k transactions were incredibly slow and bitcoin was awful in terms of usability. The transactions are clearing currently and fees are the lowest they’ve been in weeks. 
All things considered now is the best form bitcoin has been in for a while, yet prices are plummeting for what reason? Because people see red so sell because they don’t do their own research.
If people researched and logically thought about it, without seeing the 24 hour price graph, I feel they’d make much different decisions. Bitcoin SHOULD be going up right now, or even stabilising. There’s no reason for it to be falling other than as a result of FUD and because people see red numbers on a graph.

They're being very informative at the moment. Giving a really good, detailed but clear explanation of how BTC works. 
They noted that the banks had put a restriction on purchasing but made it very clear this was ONLY for credit cards and was done so to stop debt being built up.
They're doing a very positive job so far!
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:36:34
No - people who actually held made a hell of a lot of money.
If you bought 3 months ago and held, you’d be in massive profits today even after these crashes. 
If you bought 3 months ago today, and still held, you’d have about 20% profit at the time of writing this, despite the massive crash.
I don’t think it’s buying and holding if you jumped on the bandwagon over the Christmas period solely because you saw that bitcoin was gaining 10% a day on CNBC news.
3 months is one hell of a short investment, it’s not exactly holding. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:43:34
Agreed, very positive considering BBC is basically the number 1 channel in the UK! Very very good news!
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:29:19
1) It depends. You say you're investing 10% of your free cash. If 10% of your free cash is $100k, then yes you need a hardware wallet. If 10% of your free cash is $100, it's not worth it. Whatever you store OUTSIDE of a hardware wallet is at risk, so it's up to you to decide if it's worth investing in one. If you lose the coins because you didn't want to spend $100 on a hardware wallet, will you be happy? 
2) No one knows what will happen to the price, if we knew, we'd be stocking up/dumping ourselves. No one can predict what will happen. All coins are dropping at the moment, so you would hope to see a further drop of another few % then a rise back up to the ATH within the next month or so but this is all just speculation. The market is extremely difficult to predict, BTC is NOT A stock, if you treat it as one you're asking to be burned. Trading BTC as a stock is 'detrimental to its long term success' as you said in question 1. If you want to help BTC succeed you're better off hoarding, or using it as a currency as it is intended.
3) Invest whatever you're comfortable losing. Look at a BTC graph. Bitcoin has been around for 8 years. If you had bought coins any time in the last 8 years up until October 12th you would be in profit. There is only 12 days in Bitcoins ENTIRE history where you would have lost money if you'd bought and held. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:42:35
Fair enough.
At the same time, BBC funding is under government control, so I don't think they'd be too happy having a show on it if they were against it, I think we should take this as a good standpoint nonetheless. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:20:35
1) It doesn't mean much. BTC itself is still an incredible project, these forks are basically just money making schemes for developers. They're never going to take off and be better than BTC, it's just free money.
2) ...Are you using Bitcoin as a stock? Why would you sell because the price goes down? The idea of BTC is to replace fiat, not to be used to buy/sell to make short term profits. It won't end well. You'll sell now because you want short term profits and BTC will rocket up randomly 10% and you'll regret it. If you believe in BTC, hodl and ignore the prices. 
3) Blockchain is fine. They don't really support forks, I had BTC stored in there for the Bitcoin cash fork and they didn't give any BCH. Go onto their website and read their blogs about it.
4) Don't hold coins in exchanges... You need to get a real wallet like a TREZOR or Ledger, holding on coin base is never going to be a good idea.

And you don’t think that the people will reinvest when bitcoin goes back up?
Look at things from face value.
If you’re a FOMO/FUD investor (which a MASSIVE amount of people are at the minute) you simply look at graphs and base your investment on that. 
Most people don’t research ANYTHING that they invest in with the crypto space, and have no evidence to back up their claims. They simply invest in what is green and sell what is red.
Price goes from $8k &gt; $10k then shoots up from $10-$20k in a very short time. Why? Because people bought when they saw the price was rising to make a quick buck (FOMO)
- almost 0 reasoning for the price to double in price, not double the usability, just double the hype because of FOMO.
Price falls from $20k to $15k then plummets back to $10k then $8k in a very short time. Why?  Because people are selling because they see the price dropping and don’t want to lose money (FUD)
- almost 0 reasoning for the price to drop so much so fast, not half the usability, just double the FUD because price stopped climbing so high and people stopped making instant cash so they started to sell to cash their profits out and the FOMO bandwagon dropped out.
The FOMO bandwagon will be back when the price starts to stabilise/rise back up. There’s NO doubt about it. 
They had no interest in crypto before the price spike, they had no interest in the technology behind crypto whilst it was spiking (otherwise they would have held for its usage, not sold for the profits) and they’ll have no interest in crypto when they come back in the next few weeks to cash in some more FOMO profits.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:20:24
You’re a long term investor? Why are you worried then? If you’re long term and you purchased your coins more than 3 months ago you’ve made profits.

0.001, my bad.

2) It's not going to lose all value because of this fork. Bitcoin is $5.5k with a $92B market cap. The price isn't going to drop from $5.5k to $100 because of an alt-coin that has no relay protection. Do some research on the fork and you'll realise it has 0 potential. BTG price is $142. BTC is $5.5k. Look at BCH, it had a hell of a lot better development than BTG and went from $1k to $300 in a matter of weeks because no one uses it over BTC. 
4) 0.1 BTC is $550, a hardware wallet is $100. It really depends on your own mindset. If you can justify spending $100 to make sure your coins are SAFE, then at least you secure $450 and won't lose it. Personally I'd rather keep $450 safe at the cost of $100, than lose all $550. But that's a decision you need to make. :)

Yes, but my question led towards why there's not an equal 1:1 when the chain split and everyone was given equal BCH as they owned BTC, meaning in theory there should be 1 BCH for every BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:30:41
Yeah I know but they've royally fucked me. I sold some BCH for BTC, now trying to withdraw the BTC and they want me to pay a $5 transaction fee. Annoying!
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:17:12
Appreciate the response but would love to hear why you think so!
@_date: 2017-01-03 22:33:11
And where there's more liquidity than buyers to compensate? Prices lower...
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:37:22
Where is this option? Under settings, and security, I see nothing related to BCH. :(
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:24:00
Hi, 
Thanks for the response.
So how often do I need to be updating TREZOR? I had planned on leaving it for a year or so buried in a safe place and didn't plan on touching it. Do I need to take it out every X weeks to update it?
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:24:36
But isn't there a chance a rouge developer can add some code to an update that always him to steal coins?
