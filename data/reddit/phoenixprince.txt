Just read through your comment. Very succinct and clear. Thanks :)

Can some please explain what a sell wall is? I'm sorry if it's a really stupid question. All I see is graphs I don't understand.

I have a Radeon HD7950 which is giving me 470 Mhash/s right now in guiminer. I am really new to this so not sure if that is good/bad. But it's like playing cookie clicker in real life and when the numbers go up you actually get money :D

Awww thanks again! You are just awesome!

Happy Holidays!

Haha I just found that out. I have been following bitcoin for months but never had courage to get into it. Today I just got up and said eff it and started mining. I'm not doing it for the money. It's just to be a part of this awesome movement.

Actually it's more like finding a penny that let's you be part of a secret club :p

Even if you are selling to an exchange?

Thanks for the offer but I am actually in New York!

[Here]( is a cool link that actually let's you input a "random" sequence that you make up on the spot and then it tells you which randomness tests you fail because humans don't really behave randomly. It's quite fun to do and you can learn a lot about randomness here. It also teaches you how you can behave more randomly!

THANK YOU! Actually this is now going to be my first ever internet magic money! Thanks so much! Now just going to figure out how to get into my wallet...

I'm not paying electricity where I live right now so I think that's fine. In any case I am not doing it to make a profit.

I am actually on a full-ride scholarship as a PhD student and I am not very outgoing so I have a bit of cash to spare (apart from my savings which I don't ever spend under any circumstances unless it's a medical emergency or something). I think I might end up spending $100 or so. But I am basically a CS guy (no idea how markets work or anything) so the only thing that worries me is how do I decide an optimal buying point.

Apparently not. I am using a credit union as a bank (not a very well known one) so that might be the reason. I will get the bitcoin delivered on Dec 2.

What does the chasm signify?
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:06:07
Ah I see. The person paying the electricity is the school and I am guessing they factor electricity usage into the dorm cost anyway. But I really like your second point about investing that money directly into bitcoins. What would you suggest is a good amount to buy for a first timer?
