Go the other way, "I'm a 89 years old, self taught programmer after your Grandson Jimmy introduced you to coding 3 years ago, and crypto currency a year ago, and you decided to build yourself an app, hoping to inspire other people in your age bracket..."

Good read.

Totally man. For people looking in, this looks childish.

At some point. If the keys are out there. They will end up in Fran Finneys hands.

You won't get down voted. Hal Finney all the way. 
2-3 people would have been involved early on, but one person directed the group in the right direction. I think that person was Hal Finney. 
CSW wouldn't have been able to help himself but inject himself into the direction of the community. Hal would've been that voice that managed CSW. Now CSW is unleashed. 
Also agree - as a test, you send to yourself. Just like any developer would do. Did it work? Let me do a test send. Oh snap it worked.

Writer could have better phrased this as 
"The carnage was as brutal as something which happened to a family member of mine, on the day I was xxxxx"
xxxxx is for the writer to choose his own ending.

In his recent Netherlands rant - which I think had some eye opening and positive things, but had to consciously ignore the massive chip on his shoulder he was showing with his abrasive condescending attitude - CW had this quote on screen




Also found here:
The guy in the YouTube Video ranting, and the way Satoshi responded, obviously 2 different people.
CW is trying to delude the world into thinking he is Nakamoto. While I agree with a lot of what CW says (dont agree with the attitude and nastiness obviously), he doesn't help his cause by starting with a lie. Because then everything is based on a lie. CW downfall is himself. 
Whoever Nakamoto actually was - we've all got a stake in this little thing called BitCoin now. 
I doubt nChain will ever let CW speak publicly for a long time.

Ahhh what! This whole "Bitcoin thing" has made a lot of people wealthy. If you're a node, and you don't to contribute to the future development of the network by upgrading hardware and spending some of your easy gotten gains - I'm sorry but you got to get out of the way, you're slowing down our future.

I'm not on any side, I just want a healthy future for Bitcoin. But it disappoints me that nChain doesn't have anyone who proofs or asks CSW the hard questions about the papers he releases. Maybe they do, but they seem to be failing at it.
CSW has a hard job of proving what he is says is truth, or to even convince people of his arguments. He started with a lie, and everything he says or releases will be under a microscope by a community of passionate BTC'ers. We don't want to be duped again.

Awww why would I sue you buddy!? I love hearing other people's opinions and thoughts. And you be right... that he was never ever ever ever in a million or 2 years involved.  You might be right. But I'd never force you to change your mind. It's upto you to make up your mind. Something CSW fails at.
