This is a good point, but you should run the numbers on how many possible addresses fit a pattern like that, and how hard they'd have try to find a private key for an address like that. I'm getting around 2^38 , so for 2^160 different public keys (Edit: said private keys before; I think this is correct and 2^160 is the right number to compare to), you'd be looking for 1 in 2^122 .
This is a sort of dorky comparison because I don't know the comparison between vanity address generation and block mining, but if we assume one address = one hash, then they could mine about 3 x 10^20 blocks at current difficulty in the time it took them to fake such a key.

The most irritating is the people who derail any conversation about taxes to interject that taxation is immoral. First, not everyone agrees with you. Second, even if everyone did, some people would still choose to pay taxes, and they would want to know how to report Bitcoin-related things on their taxes. It's an important conversation to have, and interjecting "taxation is theft" every other comment doesn't really add to it.

It's showing *addresses* with exactly 50 BTC in them, not wallets. Often miners use a new address for the payout of every block, so before the block reward halving, there were a bunch of addresses created with 50 BTC in them which have never been moved. It's ridiculous to say that they *all* belong to Satoshi, though. There were plenty of people mining then, and I'm sure a lot of them have never needed to move most of their coins.

They own the majority of the XRP, which make XRP fairly uninteresting as a store of value and a speculative instrument, but XRP was never the point of Ripple. (It's still useful as an intermediary currency, for which the monetary policy is irrelevant.) The point of Ripple is to be a distributed exchange and payment platform. (There's a bonus side effect of being useful for LETS and social trust networks, but that's an aside.)
IOUs from gateways should be thought of like currency in an exchange. Ripple isn't built around being a store of value like Bitcoin – you should only keep as much in it (as IOUs) as you're willing to trust to a third party.
I don't think Ripple has ever been marketed any other way. For some reason though, people always assume it's supposed to be just another cryptocurrency.
Edit: Oh, and I think it's sad how little attention its consensus algorithm has gotten. Transactions confirmed and irreversible in seconds efficiently and cheaply, and it's gotten practically no attention. There aren't even people trying to make altcoins based on it.

@_date: 2012-12-31 08:44:42


When people talk about Bitcoin being a deflationary currency, they're referring to the slight monetary deflation coming from lost coins. The current extreme price deflation comes despite extreme monetary inflation from block rewards. There's no reason to believe that this will continue when Bitcoin has "caught on", so Bitcoin's track record has nothing to do with the situation you're describing.
If the demand for Bitcoin is constant and the block rewards are negligible, the price deflation due to lost coins will be very gentle - I can't give you anything better than a guess, but I'd be pretty surprised if it was more than a percent per year, because people generally keep track of their money. This is certainly very different from inflation of a few percent per year, but it's not going to create a dystopia where you delay a purchase for a few months to save money, or where investing in stocks is a terrible idea. You seem to be working on the mistaken impression that extreme deflation is built into Bitcoin, which is simply false.

Here's a simple argument. There are about 2^160 possible address/private keys (as some other comments mention). Pick a random one. It will hold, on average 1/2^(160) of all existing bitcoins. Even if all the bitcoins have been mined, this gives a payoff of about 1.4e-33 satoshis per key. This is the profitability of a brute force attack. You don't need to worry until this is more than the profitability of bitcoin mining.

If bitcoins are trading at a certain price, that means a lot of people think it's a pretty fair price. If everyone thought the price was going to go down soon, nobody would be buying at the current price; if everyone thought the price was sure to go up, nobody would be selling at the current price.
If you're lucky and clever, you might be able to outsmart the market and get cheaper coins. If you're not, you might have to buy in at a higher price. For everyone out there who thinks the current prices are unsustainable, there's someone who thinks it's just taking a breather before jumping up again. Unless you have some insight that they don't, you might as well just go with the market price.

Haven't finished reading yet, but every block should definitely get the full block reward... It's just transaction fees that are iffy.
Okay, having read it, I don't think this scheme works. The problem is that every block would need to recalculate the transaction fees for *every past block*. Suppose A, B, and C include transaction T at the same time. A and B are merged in block D which is followed by a chain of blocks leading to X. C is followed by blocks leading to Y. Now Z tries to merge X and Y. Here Z has to recalculate the transaction fees in A, B, and C. This is a lot of work, and in principle those transaction fees could have been spent by now! What happens?

Look at the first and second charts. These show the estimated hashrate of the network vs. the difficulty over time. If the hashrate curve matches the difficulty curve, the difficulty is "correct", so blocks are coming once every 10 minutes as expected. If you look for discrepancies between these, the largest difference you can find has the hashrate curve at about 50% higher than the difficulty curve, sometime mid-March. Most of the time it's much closer than that. If the hashrate is 50% too high, the rate of "extra" coins being produced is half of (block reward/10 minutes), or about 1800 BTC/day. The daily trading volumes on Mt. Gox are between about 17k - 180k BTC/day in March, so this peak rate of extra coins is in the range of 1% of a heavy trading day and 11% of a very light trading day.

First rule of economics: if you don't know anything that other investors don't know, you should expect the current price to be fair. If everybody knew that bitcoins would be worth $8000 each soon, they would be trading for $8000 today, because we're not stupid. The price of ~$800 today represents the aggregate of everyone's guesses about what it might be worth in the future. You don't need to ask a public forum what they think bitcoins will be worth – you already know what you'll get when you ask the world what bitcoins are worth, because that's exactly what the price is.

One way to see that you're wrong is that the bitcoins you "own" would be just as many and just as real if the miners had put a thousand times as much work into creating them, or a thousandth as much. A bitcoin created during a period of high difficulty is worth no more and no less than a bitcoin created during a period of low difficulty.
It would be better, perhaps, to view that hashpower as "fuel" for the bitcoin network – something which is burned in order to make it continue operating. Does ownership of a car in any way represent ownership of the gas which you have put into it over the years? Would you expect to sell a car for more, all else being equal, if you had burned more gas in it?

I'm rehashing countless discussions on this, but the economics relating hashpower, transaction fees, and block size are troubling to me. The network needs hashpower for security, but in the long run this is paid for with transaction fees. The only things governing the transaction fees is supply and demand for space in blocks. This means that block size and network security are linked in strange ways. If the demand for block space drops (because more transactions are done off-chain?), then the network hashpower will drop. If the block size is increased, then the hashpower drops. There's always going to be a segment of Bitcoin users which is pushing to increase block size, because they want cheap transactions, without understanding the consequences of that – which means that if you're interested in long-term viability, there's no guarantee that people in the future won't squander the integrity of the blockchain in exchange for cheap transactions.
(This is not to say that the block size should never be increased – just that doing so interacts with the hashpower in tricky ways. Even with constant block size, the above has some troubling implications.)
There's also the problem that running the Bitcoin network at the current level of security is expensive. Currently the transaction fees are deceptively low, because they are being payed for by inflating the money supply. All else being equal, this would mean that people would pay for it as price inflation eroded their bitcoins' purchasing power... but this is masked by the growth due to increasing interest and adoption. That is, the cost of running the Bitcoin network is being subsidized by the influx of money from new users. It's not clear to me that using Bitcoin would be as appetizing to people if they were actually bearing the costs of operating the network (which is inevitable as the block reward shrinks.)

The "deflationary" nature of Bitcoin is a bit deceptive. In the long run, the only deflation of the money supply will be due to lost coins, which presumably will be a fairly small effect. The massive (and as thomas points out, harmful) price deflation that's happening now is due to increasing demand rather than anything built into the system - in fact, we're still in the middle of pretty serious *inflation* of the money supply. (Something like 12% annualized.)
In a hypothetical future where everyone uses Bitcoin, you wouldn't see these huge demand spikes. The deflation rate would be very slow.

One way is to use expected utility with some given utility function; different utility functions give different levels of risk aversion. [More discussion](
If I remember the calculations correctly, if you use the right kind of utility function and assume that the quantities are small in the right ways, it'll simplify to a "cost of variance"; if you're indifferent between an uncertain payoff x and a certain payoff y, you'll have y = E[x] - k Var[x] for some coefficient k. (k will be positive if you're risk averse.) Hence, the largest amount of money (y) you're willing to part with for one bitcoin (x) will be less than the expected value by an amount proportional to the variance of the probability distribution you assign to the value of a bitcoin. (Note that this means that even if buying one bitcoin is a good deal at a certain price, it might not be a good deal to buy two bitcoins: Var[x] quadruples when E[x] doubles. This is consistent with the general advice that going all-in on investments is a bad idea.)

It's worth distinguishing between Ripple and XRP. XRP is a currency that's superficially comparable to Bitcoin, and has advantages (irreversible in seconds) and disadvantages, like the degree of central control, the unproven technology, and the currently closed-source nature.
Ripple does many things already that Bitcoin cannot do and the Bitcoin community has been wanting for a while, most notably acting as a distributed exchange. It does much more than Bitcoin, and the XRP currency is very much secondary to what it's trying to do. You should really do some research on it before saying it's just like Bitcoin.

That's normal. Those are unfilled orders – somebody has announced that they're willing to part with their bitcoins for 6100 CAD each, but nobody has taken them up on that offer. If you make a market order, it always gets filled with the cheapest coins available, so that offer isn't going to make a difference until all the cheaper ones are gone. (And then only if someone thinks the coins are worth it...)
If you look at the bottom of the [mtgoxUSD orderbook]( you'll see that there are a handful of coins available at prices like $1 million USD, $1 billion USD, and about $13 trillion USD. It's really more of a joke than anything else, but I'm sure they'd be willing to follow through on the offer if you took them up on it.

Have you seen Ripple? (In the new ripple.com sense.) Assuming the developers follow through on all their promises, it might be about the closest you can get to a decentralized exchange.

The new system called Ripple is very different from the old one. It has an analogue of the blockchain which works on a (largely untested) "consensus" model instead of proof of work. In addition to tracking debt, it tracks a currency superficially comparable to Bitcoin called ripples or XRP, and it adds a distributed exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:22:34
Okay, let me think through this. We have a heavily branching blockchain with many "orphaned" subtrees. The entire weight of the tree past any block containing a transaction counts as confirmation for that transaction, but there is still one branch selected in the long run, so the "active" part of the blockchain is a long chain with a sort of "frayed" end, with many smaller branches being built simultaneously by miners with slightly different information.
If there are many blocks which are ultimately orphaned, the transactions in them will need to be remined, possibly repeatedly... it'd be typical for a transaction to get many confirmations then drop down to zero again as the network realized it was orphaned.
Actually, doesn't this have the same sort of properties as Litecoin? The time until first confirmation is reduced, but the importance of a single confirmation is much less. The likelihood of an attempted double-spend succeeding would go down as the number of confirmations increased, but you'd need many confirmations before you could be reasonably sure that the transaction would go through, even in day-to-day terms. Given that you sometimes see transactions with one or two confirmations go back down to zero as a side chain is orphaned in Bitcoin, wouldn't you likely need ten to twenty minutes worth of confirmations to be quite sure that a double-spend is impossible?

I just realized that this works a lot better if the gateways extend trust to each other. If Alice uses Gateway A and Bob uses Gateway B, Gateway A and Gateway B trust each other with (say) 100,000 USD, and Alice wants to send Bob 100 USD, then we have a path Alice -&gt; Gateway A -&gt; Gateway B -&gt; Bob. Alice has 100 USD less in Gateway A IOU's, Bob has 100 USD more in Gateway B IOU's, and Gateway B has 100 USD of Gateway A IOU's. If enough of a debt accumulates between Gateway A and Gateway B, they're free to settle it as a lump sum in the real world whenever it's convenient.
...which has been the point of Ripple all along, and I'm just slow, apparently. (Edit: Also the banking system in general - this is the same process as writing a check.)
The new version does mean that if two gateways don't trust each other, you will be able to use the exchange market to make transfers between their users.

Here's the key: whatever you think the long-term value of that less than a cent USD of coins is, their current value is less than a cent USD. Why should you value them that way? Because that's how much money you can exchange for them. Let's assume that it takes more than, say $10 USD worth of your time to accumulate $10 USD worth of bitcoins this way. You could have just bought the bitcoins for $10 USD, and you'd be better off. This is true even if you're *certain* that the price will go up 1000x over the next few years. It boils down to how much your time is worth to you - the fact that it's measured in BTC is a red herring.
tl;dr: if you really think they're going to go up, just buy them.

The [claim]( is that 100 billion of them were created at genesis, 80 billion of those were gifted to OpenCoin, and 50 billion of those are earmarked to be given away (presumably in a way that incentivizes the growth and wide adoption of Ripple). I'm pretty sure there's no valid way for more XRP to be created (Edit: see below for source). So it's not really issued or controlled by anyone, but the vast majority of it is currently in the hands of OpenCoin and the Ripple developers.
Ripple has a built in distributed exchange, and you can exchange XRP with any other currency (i.e., gateway issued currency IOU) in the network, but I don't know what the price or volume there is – I don't know how to access that information without a funded account.

@_date: 2013-12-07 09:08:53
I was thinking about that, but didn't come up with a completely satisfactory solution. The "solution" of simply giving the transaction fee to each miner who includes it in a block would cause problems because it would tend to multiply transaction fees, which could be abused by miners. The simplest remotely plausible solution I came up was to have outputs for the transaction fees stay unspendable for a long time, then become spendable only if no copy of that transaction existed in a block with an earlier timestamp. I haven't pinned down the details, though, and I think there might be problems in the details.
You can also do things like using a constant block reward and a tiny fixed transaction fee per kb which is destroyed, with the transaction fee only serving as a spam discouraging tool. This would give a currency with very different properties from Bitcoin, but it would work in some sense at least.
Edit: I'm more convinced that the "fees go to the earliest timestamp" solution "works" at least in the abstract. The idea is that if I mine block B with transaction T in it, then from the point of view of a later block Y, a transaction of mine spending those transaction fees is valid only if B is the earliest block in Y's past which contains T. If a future block Z tries to merge a branch containing Y and a branch containing a block A which included T *earlier* than B, the merge will fail, because my transaction would be invalid from the point of view of Z. (It spends transaction fees which belong to the miner of A.) That means that if I spend transaction fees from T and I am not in fact the earliest existing block containing T, either any block containing my transaction will ultimately be orphaned or the earlier blocks containing T will be orphaned. (In practice, if spending transaction fees is delayed enough, this situation won't arise very often.) This might make checking whether blocks are valid too unwieldy, though. Also, are timestamps too easy to game? Would there be problems with miners turning back clocks?

Anyone who wants to make blocks is welcome to - you could start mining your own blocks, following your own rules. Maybe you want to mine blocks that give you millions of BTC. Feel free. Nobody else would recognize your blocks, though: no other miners would build on them, and nobody would accept your coins as payment for anything. You'd have your own blockchain of play money.
If (nearly) everybody - clients, miners, everybody - makes the same protocol switch at the same time, everything continues smoothly under the new rules. A couple small changes have already happened this way, but the changes could *hypothetically* be as large as you like. Maybe Bitcoin is now a distributed chess server instead of a currency ledger. No reason why not, as long as you can get everyone to agree that it's a good idea.
Alternatively, if a large enough group of miners (but not all of them) decided to change the rules, they'd be creating a fork. After that there'd be two blockchains, one following the old rules, one following the new rules. The standard client would only recognize the chain that followed the old rules unless the core developers were on board, but maybe the developers of a popular client back the change as well, and that client recognizes the new chain. Then you've basically got two parallel cryptocurrencies. It's technically possible that both could coexist happily, but it's more likely that this would seriously damage people's trust in Bitcoin, causing the value of both chains to plummet.
Any change of something as deep as the 21 million BTC limit would be divisive enough to fork the blockchain and seriously harm Bitcoin and anyone invested in it (like the miners). Which means this isn't a case of simply *trusting* the miners not to reward themselves extravagantly - it's actually hard to imagine anybody with a stake in the project thinking such a change is a good idea.

This is the *opposite* of the point of Ripple – it's about creating chains of debt instead of collapsing them. The point of Ripple is that if that the homeless guy wants to owe me $5, and I trust his friend, he can owe his friend $5 and his friend can owe me $5. This is fine with me because *I trust his friend*, and because *debt is not transitive* in Ripple. His friend's obligation to me is unconditional on his obligation to his friend. If I like, I can demand that the friend pay me the $5 immediately (after all, I trust him to honor IOUs on demand), and we are left with the homeless guy owing his friend $5. Whether the homeless guy ever settles that debt is not my problem. If the friend refuses to pay me the $5 on demand, I'm screwed, but I'm screwed because I trusted the friend and he wasn't trustworthy.
You can only end up holding debt from somebody you trust, and you can only end up screwed if somebody you trust defaults.

Ah, good point. The current ~11.5%/year monetary inflation due to block rewards is obviously much greater than the typical GDP growth rate, but I hadn't considered that there is an economy of scale – the network becomes more secure as the price goes up with fixed block reward, so at constant 51% attack resistance, the cost in bitcoins of maintaining the network goes down as the price goes up. Above a certain size, that drops below typical GDP growth, so all else being equal you'd expect your gains due to bitcoins appreciating to outpace your losses to transaction fees and money supply inflation. Interesting, assuming I've worked that out right. There's still no guarantee that the system will find the "right" level of security, though.

As long as there were no conflicts, I guess you'd be merging branches in some sense – although it'd be happening all the time, so you wouldn't exactly have "branches" so much as multiple recent blocks. The simplest version of this also simply wouldn't allow any sort of conflict resolution when merging: if there are blocks with conflicting transactions, one of them will get orphaned. If there happen to be nonconflicting transactions in it that aren't already included in the main chain at that point, they'd have to be re-included, like usual with orphan blocks – but this would only happen when people attempted double-spends.
Most transactions are mostly independent with other ones happening at the about the same time, so a completely ordered chain is overkill. All you need is every block asserting "everything below me is a consistent transaction history, and my transactions are consistent with it."

Let's imagine that the difficulty quadruples. A classical computer that's brute forcing it is going to have to compute four times as many hashes in order to find a block. For the quantum case, I think the difficulty change is going to be equivalent to quadrupling the size of the phonebook in Grover's algorithm, which only doubles the running time. If your classical computer and your quantum computer were on par with each other before the difficulty change, your quantum computer would now be finding blocks twice as fast as your classical computer.

You sounded like you might want to know more about this, and I felt like making a mini-tutorial, so here you go... hopefully I'm not explaining something you already know!
If you want to know how much of an effect a big buy or sell will have on the price, you can look at the market depth information on (for example) [mtgoxlive.com]( You'll see something that looks like [this image]( minus the red rectangles which I added.
The orange line shows all the buy orders in USD on mtgox. You can use it to see how many BTC people are offering to buy at various prices. I scrubbed along it until I got to the highlighted point, which is where the number in the lower right reads over $600000. This means that if you logged into your account on mtgox.com and sold 41753 BTC (at market price), you would instantly get $602424 USD in return, and the last bitcoin you sold would sell for $13.2 USD. This means that at the moment I took the picture, selling about $600000 USD worth of BTC on mtgox would drop the price from 16.6 to about 13.2.
The blue line shows the same thing for sell orders: if you wanted to buy BTC instantly, you can use the blue line to see how many are available right now below a certain price. The green line is the recent price history, which of course is a mess right now.

Hmm... I've been thinking since I posted that. You'd need to prove a couple things cryptographically, ideally in a way that hides certain information. You'd need to prove "I have control of at least X coins" to your recipient if you want to send them X coins. Hopefully you wouldn't need to reveal who sent them to you – that would kill a lot of the usefulness of such a currency, because the money you were sent secretly could only be sent to people you could trust to keep the secret. This would kill their fungibility. Also, less importantly, you wouldn't want to reveal exactly how many you'd received. Showing that you had the coins would involve proving that you'd received the coins, but it would also include proving that you hadn't spent the same coins already. Here we're talking about searching the entire transaction record for conflicting transactions, without revealing the contents of any of them!
I seriously doubt such a cryptographic technology exists, and I'm certain that it's not used in Bitcoin. It's not something that's totally inconceivable, though. If you invented cryptography like that, you could probably replace Bitcoin.
In the mean time – Bitcoin is not anonymous or private. There are measures that you can take to make them hard to track, with varying effectiveness depending on how much effort you want to put into it. (Using bitcoins to buy mining hardware and then minting the coins yourself is a pretty much untraceable way to launder money with Bitcoin for some purposes, for example.)

If Google wanted to secretly speed Bitcoin's adoption, it would be easy enough to run an astroturfing campaign to build an illusion of consensus about Bitcoin's potential, instead of having communities like Slashdot consistently sneering at it. Some carefully placed money could also have softened or averted the 2011 crash. They could even throw in some more low profile developers in addition to Satoshi to quietly build polished software to support the community's growth. Each of those things would be quite simple, and would go a long way towards making it seem to everybody that Bitcoin was utterly inevitable from the get-go. Instead of, you know, the actual history of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's history doesn't look like the sort of thing a corporation would orchestrate. It's too haphazard and amateurish. No malevolent superpower would go to the trouble of creating Bitcoin and then just hope for the best, letting scandals and crashes damage confidence. They'd prod it in the right direction.
Anyway, I'm way over my conspiracy theory limit for... the year. It's been fun, but what you're describing simply isn't plausible. Bitcoin looks exactly like what it says on the tin.

Right, I forgot that whatever conspiracy theory you imagine is obviously and clearly true and can be taken as fact. OpenCoin has a lot more to gain by being honest than by scamming people. Even if they sold as many XRP as they could to the market this instant, they wouldn't make that much profit in the grand scheme of things. All the IOUs issued by gateways add up to less than $1 million of value, and most of that probably isn't currently being offered for XRP. Let's say they got $1 million in revenue from this scam. (I think that's an overestimate.) Divide by the 14 employees, who are all in on it, to get ~$70,000 each. That's ignoring their investors. In exchange, they've permanently ruined the reputation of the company and all employees, destroyed OpenCoin's investment in all its other projects, and opened themselves up to legal action from their investors. This is despite the fact that they're sitting on a revolutionary consensus algorithm that could plausibly obsolete Bitcoin's, and they've already invested a great deal of money and development time.
It simply doesn't make sense for OpenCoin to try to make a quick buck here. They've invested too much, they'd get too little out of it, and they have too much to gain from following through. It's not that it's totally impossible, but the numbers don't really add up. The icky feeling you get from their marketing doesn't count as proof.

I want a BTC IOU. I can do things like making instant micropayments or trading it for USD IOUs, which I can't do directly with Bitcoin. You already probably use Mt. Gox backed BTC IOUs (i.e., your account balance at Mt. Gox).
I wouldn't keep a large BTC balance in Ripple for the same reason I wouldn't keep a large BTC balance in Bitstamp. This is one of the reasons why Ripple won't kill Bitcoin – because people want bitcoins.

They did pay a .1 BTC fee on each of the large transactions, or about $20 in fees. (Although .0005% fees is still pretty low...) The only reason I can see is if they want to be *certain* it's included in the very next block.

Imagine that all but one bitcoin is lost, or in permanent cold storage. The remaining bitcoin is being sent around regularly. That one bitcoin is going to lead to one bitcoin day being destroyed every day, because it doesn't ever sit still. But that's all. (If it's moved once a day, each transaction destroys on bitcoin day, once a day. If it's moved twice a day, each transaction destroys *half* a bitcoin day, but twice a day, for a total of one bitcoin day destroyed per day.) So if there's only one bitcoin in circulation, and it's being actively circulated, then you'll always have about one bitcoin day destroyed every day.
That means that if you average this over some time period, it gives a vague sense of how many coins were "active" during that time period. This is rather tricky to interpret in practice, though. If the bitcoin above only moves every tenth day (and is otherwise stationary), then nine days out of ten, you get zero bitcoin days destroyed (zero coins active that day – correct), but one out of ten you get ten bitcoin days destroyed, even though only one coin was "active" that day. Averaged over ten days, though, you get the right answer: one bitcoin active. Today was like that one day in ten: the number is really high, because a lot of bitcoins that previously seemed like they weren't really circulating ended up moving around all at once.

Is every non-XRP currency on the new system an IOU? It looks to me like it's either peer-to-peer IOU's or IOU's from gateways, denominated in whatever currency you like. Are, say, USD-denominated IOU's from different gateways interchangeable? I would assume not, partly because there seems to be some way that gateways can charge transaction fees on their IOU's.
It looks like there is a currency exchange built in at some level... would this include a market exchanging USD-denominated IOU's from two different gateways? Presumably arbitrageurs would keep the exchange rate at close to 1 to 1, but that's quite different from them being interchangeable...
Edit: Looking at the exchange tab, it looks like there is an "issuer" field attached to currencies other than XRP. So an IOU for 10 USD from GenericRippleGateway would appear as 10 USD(GenericRippleGateway), or something to that effect. I don't see a menu option for a USD/USD exchange with different issuers, though, so with the present interface it looks like you would have to use a different currency as an intermediary.

They rather explicitly don't believe "you catch more flies with honey than vinegar." They don't want to hold the hands of "shitlords" and show them step by step how to be a decent person – they want to expose them, vilify them, mock them, and generally do anything but legitimize them. It's a somewhat calculated tactic, and makes a certain amount of sense from the perspective of the Overton window – pushing both ends of what points of view are considered "reasonable". Whether it works and whether they come out of it with the moral high ground intact is debatable.
~~I really don't know where this "created by SomethingAwful trolls" meme came from, though. It's theoretically possible that it started that way, but it's incredibly obvious if you hang around the subs (particularly the secondary ones like SRSD) that they're completely serious about it.~~

All USD and BTC on Ripple is an IOU issued by some entity, and Ripple has a built in exchange between any pair of flavors of IOUs. That means you'd deposit USD with somebody in exchange for IOUs, the seller would deposit their BTC with somebody, and you'd exchange IOUs on Ripple. You're then each free to redeem your new IOUs. In many ways, this is very similar to just using an exchange. In particular, the numbers on that chart are probably for trading IOU's issued by Bitstamp, which is hardly any different from just trading on Bitstamp. Things only get interesting when you have a richer network of gateways and a lot of liquidity between them.

Accepting them like cash is very, very risky – you have no way to know if the person giving it to you kept a copy of the private key.

Clarification here: the small XRP transaction fees are destroyed, so they don't go to anyone. (Or equivalently, they go to everyone holding XRP.)
On the other hand, OpenCoin (who runs ripple.com) will be making money off of Ripple. Their business model is to hold some quantity of the initial XRP in reserve and ultimately sell it. This is why they're able to hire developers full time.

Actually, this makes me think of an idea: would it be possible to have a blockchain in which a block could have multiple previous blocks? Each block would confirm that all the transactions below the previous blocks were valid and non-conflicting (but might include repetitions of a single transaction), and the "mine the longest valid chain" rule would be replaced with "include as many valid non-conflicting leaves". The only time blocks would be orphaned in the long run is if two or more transactions spending the same coins were introduced, in which case all but one would be orphaned. The block rate could be very high, as in this proposal, but transactions that were mined would typically never need to be re-mined. Are there any obvious flaws with this?
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:16:44
One point here is that the information you see in the blockchain is much less coherent than a bank account. A wallet will contain keys dozens if not hundreds of addresses, and it's not always obvious which addresses belong to the same wallet (although you can sometimes detect that). Some bitcoin clients let you use brand new change addresses every time instead of reusing them; this "fragments" your money more but is considerably harder to trace. You can also create a new identity at will – particularly if you connect over Tor, there's no way to tell the difference between two people and one person using two wallets. If you add in mixing services, it's quite possible to make yourself very, very hard to track. It's definitely much, much easier to hide your traces with Bitcoin than any other electronic payment system. If the powers that be really wanted to trace everybody's money, the status quo would be a much better option than creating Bitcoin.
Although I suppose if you're thinking about a private company like Google trying to track the typical user instead of a government trying to track illegal activity, the fact that you can choose to hide your activity is less relevant, because most people won't go to the trouble.
Perhaps the best counterargument I have for you is that an organization that was trying to make a traceable cryptocurrency would make Ripple instead of Bitcoin – there, addresses correspond more or less one-to-one with identities, instead of the many-to-one relationship in Bitcoin. It's absolutely simple to tell how much money somebody has and what they've been doing with it in Ripple. Additionally, it's harder to use Ripple anonymously, because people won't trust you without knowing who you are.
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:57:43
Well, currently Ripple is pretty much pinned down to ripple.com and OpenCoin. But in the future, the plan is for it to be completely decentralized, so then you would be correct. Presumably rippleUSD just refers to any BTC/USD trades on the Ripple network. (Perhaps restricted to certain issuers.)

One way of phrasing this question is "If you were to set a computer to generating private keys at random, what would the payoff be?". You will get 21000000 BTC if you generate all 2^160 keys, so the expected payoff of generating one key is 21000000/2^160 ~ 1.4 x 10^(-41) BTC/key. At one trillion keys per second, this is an expected value of 4.5 x 10^(-22) BTC/year. It would take 2.2 x 10^13 years to have an expected value of one satoshi.

I wonder if it would be a good idea for large miners to adopt a protocol to avoid assisting in pool double spends. You should be able to detect when an attack might be happening: if your pool is secretly mining a fork, it won't be producing blocks on the main chain as it ought to. Thus if the time since the last block found grows past, say, three or four times what you would typically expect, you conclude that they might be using your hashpower to mine a fork instead and switch to a different pool. This is in your interests, because you don't want to risk missing out on block rewards if the fork fails, and you presumably have a stake in Bitcoin's overall health. The cost of switching pools is very small, so there's very little risk.
If even a fairly small number of large miners adopted this protocol, it would be *extremely* difficult for a pool to reverse a six confirmation transaction. If the pool wasn't keeping up with its expected hashpower on the main chain, it would start losing hashpower to the main chain. Unless it had a vast majority of the hashpower to begin with, this would quickly bring it under 50%.

I'm a little fuzzy on the details, so someone correct me if I'm wrong on this, but the address is actually the hash of an ECDSA public key. A transaction is a message signed with the a private key, together with the corresponding public key, which must hash to the correct address. This means that before you send a transaction, the world only knows the hash of the public key, and once you send the transaction, the public key itself is in the blockchain forever. This means you've done half the work of an attacker – they don't need to be able to reverse the hash function, they just need to be able to find an ECDSA private key from its public key.
And yes, people believe that quantum computers can do the latter quickly, but not the former. It's also in principle possible that somebody will figure out how to do either of these quickly with a classical computer at some point, which is why it's a little nice to have two steps protecting your money.

Microtransactions actually make sense for mining fees, because the total of all fees is added into the coinbase output. On the other hand, if you have one address receive 1000 tiny transactions, the transaction to spend them would have to be huge, and take up a lot of block space. There's a "fragmentation" problem for accumulated transaction outputs that doesn't exist for accumulated mining fees.
The claim is not that anything less than 5430 satoshis is not money, the claim is that it's not worth the block space it would take to spend it. Hence "uneconomical", not "worthless".

If you picked a line ahead of time, it would be very unlikely that the price would bottom out on it again and again. But that's not what you're doing.

It's not always going to be possible to draw a plausible trendline on random data, but it often is.

There's a lot going on. The shallow pale orange and blue lines go together, and they form a graph of the current market depth – the number of coins currently for sale on the exchange below that price (the blue line, called the ask depth), or the number of coins which people are offering to buy for at least that price (the orange line, called the bid depth). To figure out how much a 1000 BTC market buy will raise the price, you find where the blue curve reaches 1000 BTC on the left, and look at the price below that.
The shallower these curves are, the more "slippage" there is from large buys and sells.

A 51% double spend attack requires letting a transaction get a lot of confirmations while building a fork in secret which includes an incompatible transaction. If a pool operator tried to use the pool's hash power to build a fork in secret, it would be clear to the pool's miners. The pool would stop producing blocks on the main chain, which would cut into the miner's revenue. Any miner that was paying attention would be switching to a different pool as soon as they figured it out, because the non-colluding pools would be getting the lion's share of the blocks on the main chain.
Also, everyone would notice the pools dropping out and probably recommend merchants not accept transactions until they'd worked out what was going on.
So no, even if one pool controlled more than half the hashpower by itself, it couldn't really pull off a double spend. On the other hand, if a sinister entity controlled 51% of the hashpower right now, we'd never know. They could be having a fraction of it mine for each major pool while they wait for the right opportunity for a double spend, and there wouldn't be any visible signs until they started to work on their alternate fork.

           = 234466.91757 seconds
           = ~65 hours
If you don't use a pool, you'll get slightly more money in the long run (a few percent), but it'll be in lump sums coming randomly every few days. I'd personally choose the steadier cashflow of a pool with those numbers, but it depends on your own risk aversion and long term plans.

I'll check back on this thread in a day or two when I can think more deeply about this and see if I can make a stronger case that what you want is impossible, but I assure you that people much smarter and more paranoid about security than I haven't been able to come up with a better way. If you want to talk to those people directly, hang around the relevant parts of bitcointalk.org.

Not totally sure, but I think they mean that it only gives the expected value, with no adjustment for variance. Would you rather have $100 or a 50-50 chance of $0 and $200? Unless people are specifically looking for the entertainment value of gambling, they tend to prefer the former.

It relies on *reversing* a hash function, which is basically a reverse phonebook search. Grover's algorithm would probably apply and give an order sqrt(n) algorithm for finding suitable nonces. I think one side effect of this is that the effective classical hashrate of your hardware would grow with increasing difficulty. (Not fast enough to keep pace – I think it would grow as sqrt(difficulty) – but still.) This breaks some of the assumptions behind the difficulty adjusting algorithm, so difficulty might not adjust as well. I suspect it would still be able to adjust in the long term, meaning there wouldn't be too much effect.

If you make a cake and somebody steals it, who are you going to report it to? Are cakes backed by Betty Crocker?
