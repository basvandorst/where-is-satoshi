Question should be can I use segwit fee benefits when sending to non-segwit addresses. The answer is yes, but the receiver won't be able to have those benefits. So try to force your uses to receive on segwit addresses as well.

the block explorer that never works, is always out of sync, and wait.. the same with the forums too.

How to ensure that these mining pools cannot do pump and dump? Isn't the hash power of a pool based on its user's choice? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:03:25
Is this related to OWAS? 
@_date: 2016-10-05 18:40:03
I still don't get how double spends can be prevented. Explain anyone?
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:02:52
Can anyone check the legislation? What happened in the end? Same thing happened to me. I ordered something worth 5 bitcoins and now they say its out of stock. They are also giving me useless gift cards. I want by coins back. What do I do. I feel cheated!!!
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:46:27
Not really. One user on  claimed to have received BTC about an hour ago that was sitting in the withdrawl queue. No one else has claimed this. I myself can confirm that I have not received any BTC from them. I have a few in queue. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:15:31
Simon, you are testing our patience. We will listen to your problems as long as you can convince us that you are doing everything in your power. Lack of communication on the other hand will piss off a lot of people. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:28:27
We know his public key. He can sign a message under that key. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 16:43:18
oh bitcointalk.. thats ok... I first read it as "bitcoin down"
Thermos should fix it in a few days as usual.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:47:59
We are still waiting for withdrawl page. Please update us on this. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:19:24
So he expects us to get the ip addresses and verify from the two forums to check if it is indeed him. Further he took the time to register on the forum, which he could have used to write a simple update on his official bitcoin-24.com site. What more clues do you need? 
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:07:56
The poster on that forum is 100% a troll.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:17:56
1000 times better communicatiion than bitcoin-24.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:22:55
the admins should come up themselves and post it here if they have any soul.
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:22:59
Oh good !! getting my popcorn ready for your official statement. I too have funds there, so keeping fingers crossed.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:15:11
Why 0 BTC fee? I just transfered 10 BTC and paid 0.005 btc fee. This dude transferred 60K btc and does not want to pay a fee???
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:31:43
Thanks for the update. Can you also please put something on the actual site so we know its indeed you. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:13:31
It doesn't matter. Any identity of Simon registered after the incident cannot be trusted, even if it is indeed him. If it is the real him then he is exteremely stupid. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:54:42
I can feel your frustration. Please keep us updated on if you were able to get in touch personally. Clearly SIMON IS AVOIDING THE BTC TOPIC. He just keeps whining about his bank accounts and whatnot. We DON'T CARE about the accounts. WE JUST WANT OUR BTC BACK NOW!!!
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:03:01
Can you help me figure out how to get my money (fiat/BTC) off this exchange and into my hands. Me and several others will be thankful.

Logged in while sipping a Martini in a vacation spot. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:40:26
Would anyone want to be in Simon's shoes right now? 
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:50:27
Still standing by that statement?
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:55:09
When will we get our bitcoins? Why are you holding them hostage? This has no connection to your bank accounts.
You HAVE TO given an ETA for WITHDRAWING BTC. Lots of us don't care about frozen accounts. WE JUST WANT OUR BTC BACK!!!! 
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:08:14
Can you please answer the questions below?
1. When will the 2.0 site be online?
2. When will we be able to withdraw BTC?
I don't care about bank account opening. It is clearly unrelated to BTCs that I have on your site.
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:41:14
Has he stopped reading and using reddit? I think this is just a classic stalling technique used by scammers to create confusion (pasting scattered information at different places). Anyway ignore the above. This is not real. I am 100% sure. It does not make sense for any sane person to do this. A professional would use a GPG public key to authenticate his messages.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:35:59
hmm betcoins and Satoshidice. This is indeed very strange! 
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:54:01
So is the ETA Friday?
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:28:20
Well he has stated, all funds are safe. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:21:03
Any way to figure out the ip address where he logged from? 
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:36:27
How much are these monthly payments?
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:21:57
Don't tell me you lost money also on bitfloor. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:08:11
Waiting for updates. Whats going on. Any other news on when this will be sorted out. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:28:56
greed makes people blind.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:08:50
He probably left Europe in the last two days of his stalling. He was not fixing his server. He was waiting to board a plane. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:19:14
100 bitcoins? Isn't that a bit cheap? I'd go for at least 1000
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:46:53
I think if we don't hear anything by today, you need to go ahead.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:10:12
Please post all his information and everyone related to him. Friends, family, etc. We need all the information we can get.
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:16:50
It will be awesome if we can collectively "extract" or at least "invalidate" those coins.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:25:57
So the rumor that he was detailed is false.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:27:37
Forget about bank accounts. I just want my coins out of there. How does that happen. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:25:40
yes definitely ask Davout for help. He knows all the legalities of this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:06:37
Can you provide more details? Mine seems peanuts in front of this.. If you mean 6000 BTC that is.
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:20:39
Money is no longer important. We need justice now. Legal justice! I also filed an online report using the email provided below. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:40:28
Is is still on IRC? Has he been comminicating there?
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:40:02
Why is he scattering information all around? Very fishy. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:33:52
This is god's way of telling me to do due diligence. I was greedy and wanted to do a quick "dump and buy", and BTC24 was giving the best rate.
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:52:49
Hope your lawyers give the "go" soon. Good luck. Even I have funds there.. many BTC. Hope to see them soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:02:34
But with BTC there is no problem.. right?
so can you please send the BTC we have there.
@_date: 2013-06-28 19:41:47
I know a guy who works in citibank who holds a LOT of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:54:50
or its one of the "cold wallets" for running away. 
@_date: 2013-09-22 21:56:03
Sadly, even the OP does not know how crawlers work. Lots of people have no clue. They think Google and other search engines magically guess urls or bruteforce them. It is possible to bruteforce url wallets but thats the point of having a large random string in the url. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:37:12
Where exactly is Simon now? I put my honest BTC there. Why should I suffer for this? He has to take out BTC from his own stash to make up for it. He doesn't even have the sense to apologize for his mistakes which put us in this mess. He just keeps whining about banks. I want my BTC. I dont care about his bank problems. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:39:35

If all the funds were indeed in a hot wallet, then I don't even feel sorry for them. A fool and his bitcoins are soon parted.
So when are we going to see the effect on Bitcoin prices?
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:42:27
It is clear from his lack of responses that he does not intend to return anyone's money. I'd recommend everyone to please file a police complaint and legally pursue this with their lawyers before it is too late to recover anything. I don't understand why Simon doesn't realize the gravity of the situation. Lots of lost money = lots of pissed off people. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:59:24
I don't care about my money anymore. I just want him to go to Jail for a looooong time. In fact I will give 25 BTC to ensure that he goes to Prison. Please file a police report. We need to ensure that he does not leave Europe (if he has already not done so). 
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:46:27
All these are excuses to steal our coins. He would have come up with some other excuse if it was not this... "I got hit by a bus on the way to unfreeze our accounts" 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:41:23
or a well-planned scheme.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:11:29
Its a problem with blockchain.info. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:05:10
Now you tell me 80 Euro orders cannot be canceled :P I already did the withdraw, have 0 btc there and those withdrawn ones also have not come.. But anyway, I guess those 80 Euro orders will be reversed if executed. Wonder why the site on this IP is live while the other one is not. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:55:56
Please post the relevant text to support that "whatever it means" statement. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:43:20
Thanks. It was indeed in spam. I withdrew it. Funds were reduced. It shows that transaction has been accepted. But nothing coming as you mentioned that the hot wallet is empty. Can you please give more info. How the wallet was emptied, and when.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:46:13
Just my 0.2 BTC. Bitcoin-24 is down right now. Dont know about bitfloor but I've heard unhappy stories from there too. I'd say avoid both. Find an alternative.
