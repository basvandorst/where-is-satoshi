Mentioning that it's cryptographically secure is important. 
@_date: 2012-08-26 19:50:58
And what's the problem with that?
@_date: 2012-11-19 17:41:08


@_date: 2012-10-02 08:34:38
is that way.

Send them a support message. They'll answer.

This is ridiculous.

[Here's mine, people!]( It takes a while, but [it definitely gets through]( Remember to verify your phone number and your email! 
@_date: 2012-09-05 16:44:27
well, you can email your wallet to your friend but that's not actually a good idea...
@_date: 2012-08-15 19:22:44
Not that there's anything wrong on using a referral link, but you could say it at least (and not pretend you're a part of Coinbase :P)
For the record, here's [*my* referral link]( and here's a [referral-free link](
EDIT: Also, remember to verify your email *and* your phone!

This. Use a mixer.

Well, duh. But they would need to pay taxes on their bitcoin income.

I think it's supposed to be "tip" or "bitcointip"

Except I doubt cloud processing is harmful to the user.
@_date: 2012-09-03 14:07:56
Some people also think that the Internet is going to magically stole their credit cards no matter what.
@_date: 2012-08-12 22:22:08
That's because people over 20 don't understand Bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-09-05 16:27:01
You can't "upload a coin". That doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2012-08-16 02:36:24
since the very beginning, i think? no scamming going on, they just ask you to verify using a smartphone app or a sms
@_date: 2012-10-29 22:03:16
No, but I use the goddamned Google Translate thingy instead of bitching "we speak 'murrican over here!"

Networks aren't usually measured in terms of raw computing power, but on the devices connected to those networks.

OH NO! YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BREAK OUT OF YOUR LITTLE AMERICAN BUBBLE!

There aren't that many decimals on BTC yet. Consider creating new wallets on the fly.

Okay, I'm going to answer your questions. I haven't read the replies below, but, regarding the client sync, I guess someone else has already pointed out that you can use web clients (such as coinbase.com) or light clients (such as MultiBit and Electrum) to manage your Bitcoins.
1. What exactly is a bitcoin? A string of text? A hash? A file with a string of text?
Actually, it is none of the above. A "bitcoin" does not exist on the network: what exists is the transaction in which a bitcoin is created and the transactions in which that bitcoin changes hands. If I "have" a bitcoin, that bitcoin exists merely because you can follow the chain of transactions which leads to my bitcoin address "receiving" that bitcoin.
As a quick example, imagine that you and I create a new currency called "imaginary dollars". You have one imaginary dollar, and I know you have it. That imaginary dollar "exists" because we both agree that you have the imaginary dollar. Now we write it down in what would be analogous to the blockchain: "DanielTaylor has one (1) imaginary dollar". To all intents and purposes, you have that imaginary dollar, valid on our imaginary dollar currency, because both of us agree that you have it. Bitcoin is basically this, with a layer of criptography for verification and the whole "block mining" thing for generating the initial wealth.
2. If I'm not mistaken, a bitcoin wallet is made of a public key and a private key. If I want to transfer my wallet from one program to another or a piece of paper... would I need to export or print out the strings of text that form the bitcoins itself or do I just need those two keys?
You only need your private key. The Bitcoin-Qt program (among others) allows you to export your private key. To continue the previous analogy, the private key would help you prove other people that you are DanielTaylor, which is necessary if you want someone to accept your imaginary dollar.
3. How does the bitcoin system know how much balance is inside an wallet/account. Does it typically ONLY check it against the chainblock or does it also make use of any bitcoin strings stored inside the wallet?
Again: there is no such thing as "bitcoin strings". So, yeah, it is verified against the blockchain and against the unverified transactions on the network.
4. Cryptographically speaking... what happens when I transfer bitcoins?
As you said "cryptographically speaking", I'm going to assume you know cryptography terms. For this explanation, I'm going to ignore the internals of the script system (Bitcoin has an [assembly-like script language]( embedded which allows for complex transactions) 
So, when you transfer bitcoins to someone else, you are taking one or more "inputs" (previous transactions directed to your public key, which you can redeem using your private key) and creating one or more "outputs" (new transactions signed with your private key and directed to the public key of whoever is meant to receive your transaction). That person can redeem those bitcoins by using it as "input" for a new transaction. You don't really "own" the bitcoins: you're just the only one which can prove (with the private key) to be the owner of the public key to which the transaction was directed at, and therefore the only one who can create new transactions using those bitcoins.

What I learnt from pirate: man, a lot of people are dumb.
@_date: 2012-09-05 16:31:44
Uh... what's a "bit coin file"?
@_date: 2012-09-27 02:24:57
I got it and most of the ones from the people I referred. 
@_date: 2012-08-31 21:45:01
What's wrong with Linode?
@_date: 2012-08-19 11:53:58
BDT launched on the same day it was hacked. It probably didn't have many coins.
@_date: 2012-09-03 19:55:21
Tell me more about how Bitcoin is, of all things, simple.
"See, you just have to create a cryptographic key pair, store the private one, send a modified version of the public one to someone who will use his own private key to sign a message which will then be broadcasted to all members of the network, who will add it to a set of transactions which is then hashed several times until the hash matches a bitm... what's that green paper thing for?"
@_date: 2012-09-13 01:18:30
Wrong. The difficulty adjusts itself every 2016 blocks. In the meantime, BFL would be able to pull more than one block every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2012-09-28 23:24:09
Use a different client, like MultiBit or Electrum.
@_date: 2012-08-30 22:07:17


I don't think it's bigger than Tor, Bittorrent. Hell, it's probably not bigger than Kademlia.

Oh, sorry. Deleting the post now. Thanks for warning me!
