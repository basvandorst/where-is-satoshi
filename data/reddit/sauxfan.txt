Here’s my understanding, someone can correct me where I’m wrong.
Banks are required to maintain a certain amount of cash at the end of the day. When banks are below this amount at end of day, they normally take overnight loans from other banks to maintain the required liquidity level (these one night loans are REPO agreements). For whatever reason, liquidity has disappeared and therefore the interest rates on these overnight nights shot up dramatically as there was too much demand, and not enough overnight cash supply. So in order to maintain the desired interest rate, the Fed stepped in and started providing this overnight liquidity.
Where I get lost is the next day, when the financial institution pays back the overnight loan. Does the money the Fed injected into the market overnight disappear upon repayment? Or does it stay in circulation? That I don’t know

My best guess to your second question is that banks are extending credit at a faster rate than they are getting deposits. Seems bad at first, but that’s only if theres some reason to think the loans they are giving out are bad to some specific industry

Just bought bitcoin for the first time on coin base. It said the price 7520 but when I bought it was 7559? Immediately lost money why?

Ah so it was just the commission? I thought they would just add the commission to my purchase amount. Any way to reduce the commission?
