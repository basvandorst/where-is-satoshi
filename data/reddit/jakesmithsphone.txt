What percentage of foreign-held central bank-backed currencies have failed? Because that's what you are comparing, not all forms of payment ever. USD, GBP, EUR, CAD, JPY...

And yet, his statements are correct. Maybe, just maybe, he knows what he's talking about and that's precisely because he has thought about it. Maybe it isn't ignorance or economic illiteracy, as you said, but something worth hearing because he is well-respected and that respect is on the line when he talks economics.

Stimulus is needed for the exact same reason that deflation is bad: we need a high and stable velocity of money. If common citizens deleverage and hoard, stimulus keeps money flowing.

In a sub full of dumb statements, this is officially the dumbest. Congrats!

No, you missed the point. There's a fixed supply of both gold and bitcoin and gold standard currencies were volatile and, in general, terrible at being currencies. The USD doesn't have these issues previously because it is controlled by a central bank. The reason is that central banks work, despite your erroneous claims that they can't control hyperinflation. They've been working far better than anything mined ever has.

Just a warning: buying puts is as stupid as buying calls, or to a lesser degree, the underlying. Because there is no intrinsic value, it makes just as much sense at a million dollars as at ten cents, which is still zero sense. It is diverged entirely from "worth" or "value" and placing options in either direction is pure gambling.

Done.

Think long and hard about what you just said. And don't stop thinking until you realize why you might be wrong to think that's a feature. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:33:09
So those failed currencies have much more in common with bitcoin and much less in common with, say, the USD. Got it.

There's a very limited supply of my middle school art. That's why each piece could sell for millions of dollars if I was willing to part with the masterpieces for less than a few billion. Hold on, I'm going to go further limit the supply by destroying one piece of art. It's very clear that a limited supply is the measure of value.

This is all pretty much correct. It is gambling because the price has no correlation to value, which as you stated, is zero. Furthermore, since bitcoin is so volatile, your IV would be astronomical and prohibitive. Those two mean that both buying and selling both puts and calls is incredibly dangerous. Even a straddle is dangerous.  
  
Bitcoin may go to zero, but buying a put can also go to zero if timing isn't perfect, and there's no reason to think it would be. Futures are a little better, but not much. I've been trying to think of a safe way to short bitcoin, but no matter how you go about it, it should be just as much of a gamble as going long. The best I can come up with is to take the open source code, make a bitcoin2skittlesNtwix, and sell it to the same fools.  
  
Going to zero and going to zero now are two very different things with the premium you'd have to pay.

That sounds more like cash. Bitcoin isn't easy to use and it is a lot more dangerous and there is no Federal Bitcoin Reserve helping to keep inflation stable and you can't use Bitcoin in many places unlike cash on all fronts.

You mean it is available in USD. Not bitcoin. You aren't paying in bitcoin, you are paying in USD.

But there is an unlimited number of fake coins that can be invented. People will use whatever is the most useful for them and if there just isn't enough bitcoin to go around, it won't be adopted. And those that try to latch onto it, like you, are hoarding it as a commodity, not actual money. So what you are really saying is that once everybody hoards your fake currency that is actually a commodity, that actually has infinite interchangeable replacements, that's when you will be moonshot. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:25:55
That would be good. 45 cents would be even better.

Being that he just attacked bitcoin again, I give it a 0% chance that bitcoin.com has any basis of truth and 100% chance they are just lying sacks of shit trying to get people like you to keep throwing money at bitcoin rather than listening to the smart guy saying smart things.    
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:36:35
How dumb are you?
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:37:15
That's just not true at all.

You idiots are idiots. We tell you for years it's a scam and you don't believe us. Then a well-respected, intelligent, and informed observer says the same thing. Your reaction? Act like a cult and stand firmer in your belief. Bitcoin is a fraud. You wanting it not to be doesn't make it not a fraud. Listen to the man. He knows more about economics than any of you ever will and he is paid for that very reason. If buying bitcoin was smart, he would do that instead of avoiding it like every other smart person the world over does. Your cult is truly fascinating. People are weird.
