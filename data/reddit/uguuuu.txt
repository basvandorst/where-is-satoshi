I was only talking about *http* connections, not *https*.
If the user specifically types in https:// then you are correct in that now becomes non-trivial to modify/eavesdrop on the connection.

I have just tested this, and while you are correct you can *import* a wallet with an invalid label, the label *IS* validated upon secondary loading of the wallet.
Meaning, this is only an issue for the CURRENT session.
**tl;dr: This is not a persistent issue, it is only an issue until you reload the page.**

No, that is not the issue.
A tor exit node is basicly a proxy. They can fully edit plaintext ( connections sent through them and *make* a site on http:// *even if there is none*.

They use [HSTS]( which is more secure if you have ever visited over https:// all further requests will FORCIBLY be set to https:// (Well for a year anyway)
The duty of 'training' users to manually type ' is not blockchain.info's responsibility.
Furthermore, no matter what blockchain.info does, it cannot protect users against a malicious end node when a user types in ' The tor browser bundle by default will not save the HSTS header.
Infact, I would argue that blocking the majority of tor nodes actually DOES help prevent this issue, as the odds of getting an unblocked node via the automatic 'use new identity' is very slim. And a normal user will likely give up after several attempts.

Yes, but it is describing an inherent feature™ of the JVM. HttpURLConnection will not follow protocol changing redirects.
 explains the issue in more detail.


This is actually still an issue, but if you test it with Google/etc they will automagically use https (I assume due to cert pinning?)
    public static void main(String[] args)  throws Exception
    	{
    		String page = "
            URL url = new URL(page);
            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            conn.setFollowRedirects(true); //&lt;-- true
            conn.connect();
            
            System.out.println("conn.getResponseCode(): " +conn.getResponseCode());
    
            InputStream input = conn.getInputStream();
            for (;;) {
                byte [] buf = new byte[1024];
                int len = input.read(buf, 0, buf.length);
                if (len &lt;= 0)
                    break;
                System.out.print(new String(buf, 0, len));

Both can be enabled with zero code changes to bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2014-11-29 13:56:04
Simplifying this a bit, but using TOR to connect to ANY site with ** links is insecure by design.
However, verifying that the url is ** and no certificate errors are displayed (If the certificate authorities are to be trusted) is secure.

This only works if your product doesn't have heavy competition.
People may just browse around, see your price is 3% higher, and then checkout with someone else. (As well as paying the 3% extra at checkout)
@_date: 2015-05-29 11:39:06
This is actually the default Java behavior.
Edit: Just noticed they also explicitly disabled redirects as well.

In fact I would argue that Google's 2FA is more secure than Authy/MePIN as it doesn't rely on a third party to handle your keys.
There are plenty of open source "Google Authenticator" implementations which you can fully audit yourself.

Also want to point out, after looking a bit the proof-of-work seems flawed to me.
To do 80,000 SHA1 iterations:  
Higher end phone 6,000 milliseconds  
Desktop PC 3,000 ms  
Single threaded java application 220 ms.  
A competent bot would have little to no issue creating valid proofs for every request. And raising the work would create too long of a work for normal users. Let alone what would happen if you added a GPU to the mix.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:58:41
Tons of servers, anycast IPs (All ips point to the closest server to the user, so attack traffic is directed to all possible proxy nodes), custom WAF (They maintain bot ratio detection algos, suspicious post filters), but mostly just the backing of lots of hardware/bandwith a software solution cant match.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:47:34
There are two types of addresses, compressed and uncompressed. 
That private key is both of the addresses you mentioned.

Firewall modules are *very* expensive to buy/rent.
The reason cloudflare can supply them to cheaply is they are pooled/shared resources instead of dedicated.
Also, just so you know there are bots with full javascript implementations which will run your automated verification code just like a browser now.

How does this possibly hope to prevent volumetric DDoS attacks?
@_date: 2015-01-06 04:32:39
They could always do that...
If you go to the http:// and are being MITM'd there is nothing Bitstamp could do.
The redirect from http:// to https:// could be intercepted. (SSLStrip)
(HSTS could help, but only works after you've visited https:// once, and do not clear browser data. aka no tor/privacy settings enabled)
@_date: 2015-01-27 07:22:04
Volumetric attacks either bandwidth or packets-per-second would never even make it to this protection. If an attacker sends you 10gbps and you have a 1gbps link, your server is unreachable.
Equally so, if an attacker sends a few million (Small) packets per second, your processing resources are exhausted.
Another problem is an attacker can solve the problem thousands of percent faster than an average computer can via javascript. (It's very slow)

This number includes their API /  which lots of other wallets/services use.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:02:37
Yeah they are, by no means are your bitcoins lost. 
If whatever wallet you are trying to import in does not give you the option to switch type, you can use the following commands via the javascript console @ blockchain.info with any wallet to export both versions of the private keys in WIF format.
    MyWallet.pkBytesToSipa(MyWallet.decodePK("EALLyhSxcVww3yW3qWWZ2L5mB6hcNLNJzxLTjWbfBBEx"), "1CckWDvpn8MXiDJ2L9HGDGMDCpLz2DYYuj")
    "L3mq1wWkzgHRJT9BG2q4mcxP1a7rFfBT6QMGTS4bmWPqbPGiurWM"

@_date: 2015-01-26 22:18:08
That doesn't solve anything though. I'm not actually sure a POW can work with javascript crypto like this. (It's too slow)
A legit javascript client could solve it on their first guess, who is to say that is wrong?
As well as a bot could just hold onto a solution for the configured delay, having several concurrently running the delay is the same effect as single running instantly.
It can be a good block for low hanging fruit, but there is no way this will defeat an actual directed attack.

It's only an anecdotal story from a coinbase staff member, but bitcoin being irreversible and pseudo-anonymous I can see the fraud rate being *very* high.


Sure, and I think they're trying to pivot towards that model. Remember they only recently got the USD wallet support in many states, and still have half (From member) left to get licenses for.
From what I understand there are many more legal hurdles to jump with that model vs their legacy broker model.
@_date: 2015-03-14 08:51:08

If they instantly (Or even just never take your money) it becomes much much faster for fraudulent users to figure out and bypass their checks.

Bitcoin itself is an 'authenticated' protocol.
Even if you blindly trusted an attacker, the worst that can be done is lying about your balance and get you to sign invalid transactions. No matter what data they tell you about the blockchain, they cannot get you to sign a transaction that steals your bitcoin.
