From the article: "What deflation actually means is a sticky subject, but what most Keynesians .. mean .. is the phenomenon of falling prices."
It's just a refutation of the Keynesian theory, not an attempt to define 'deflation' properly.

He's good on pretty much everything else... He's just dismissing Bitcoin as "something that can be created by a computer", I assume, without giving it a closer look (which I was guilty of at one time as well!).

Good point... But doesn't that bring into question "what is an economist?"  Maybe it's not that economics *isn't a science* but that most of the people calling themselves "economists" aren't scientific.
But the whole point of that paragraph was to point out "economics is hard," because you can't have controlled experiments.

Boy, this is a tough crowd to please.
If consumer purchases fall during times of "inflation" (price increases as measured in BTC), then is it such a stretch to think they would *rise* in times of "deflation" (price decreases)?  After all, the number of purchases (as seen, say, on the earlier part of that chart) *had to* rise from somewhere (the only assumption being made that they rose during times of BTC price increases, or "deflation").

A large part of what GATA does is simply point out facts... Central bankers have openly admitted to operating in the gold market for decades; most people simply ignore it.
The naked short selling thing (though I find it plausible) does not make or break GATA's case.

It's not exactly intended for a scientific journal, but you point to no specific turds that can lead us to conclude it's "full of shit".

Gold has proven itstelf as an excellent store of value for thousands of years; Bitcoin has six now (plus one serious security vulnerability, plus one almost-serious Blockchain fork). It would not be imprudent to own some physical metal. :-)
(Long gold, long BTC, short fiat and "sovereign" debt.)

This is the big story few talk about -- the frac-reserve gold system (aside from a couple of 'fringe' outlets, including GATA). But I would take it as a reason to be bullish on gold, not BTC... That said, it doesn't hurt the case for Bitcoin.
