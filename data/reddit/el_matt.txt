It looks really good so far- almost perfect but it's having trouble authenticating my keys for Binance and for Cryptopia. I've checked them each a few times so I don't think it's a mistake on my end.

Thanks for replying! Binance fixed itself after a little while but Cryotopia hasn't yet. I'll see if the system clock has anything to do with it.

If he's using both hands to hold the box... Then who was camera?

If they want to search your bags, they *will*. All you gain by not submitting to the search is a little time spent in a holding cell.

Serious question: what signals do *you* use to identify a definite bottom?

The point you're trying to make is a valid one in that people can be panicky, unpredictable creatures and markets can swing around like crazy. Nevertheless, in poker one is playing the person opposite, not their cards. And it's a similar game in trading (stocks, crypto, whatever).
There *are* certain patterns of behaviour which sometimes repeat, and spotting them before they complete is part of the skill of trading and of playing poker. That's why sometimes technical analysis gets things right, but a lot of the time luck, chance and outside influences have a much bigger effect.
It's really weighting the importance of evidence from different sources and assessing risk.

The first D stands for "distributed". If you're doing it from one place, then you're not distributing it very far.

Why use 3 syllables when 4 will suffice?

That's not really what  he's saying. Imagine you are gradually keeping your savings in your mattress, although you know there's a likelihood someone could break in and take the lot, but you don't know exactly how. If it's going to happen, would you rather it happened when you have a tenner in there, or years down the line when you have thousands? Either way you learn something, but one way is more expensive...

I really hope you're laughing at "adoptation" (should be "adoption", OP) and not the concept of mass adoption.

At the time of writing, yours is the third comment in this layer. 3 = 3 = 3 = 3. That's 3 equals signs. [Half-Life 3 confirmed](

In which case I apologise and remove my down vote, but let thus be a lesson to you that sarcastic irony doesn't work on the internet...
