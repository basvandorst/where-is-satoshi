My Xmas paper wallet gift was lost by the recipient _(:з」∠)_

I read this in pewdiepie's voice 
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:54:59
The blockchain isn't already compressed!?!?

Mtgox is bankrupt. If you can find your way to reddit, you don't need a link
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:01:24
Read the news bub
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:26:46
"Andreas Antonopolous has examined Gox’s code to some degree, and remarked that they are using a strange **“hodgepodge of technologies that are really not suitable for running an exchange.”**"
@_date: 2014-12-20 10:39:04
Yes. Other countries are planning to do the same.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:21:07
MtGox v2.O in 2 weeks then? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:51:35
9 is mooncoin

Haha I just realised its on my set of house keys that I use daily. Its become one of those things that are hidden in plain sight but never used
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:54:13
Me too. I left because I wrote a bot but couldn't keep track of what I had bought and sold accurately because the tx id changed on every successful order. It drove me bonkers. Kind of ironic now!
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:02:49
Not trying to be smug. I suggest you stay away from altcoins because you don't seem to be able to put 2 and 2 together. Your going to get burned on pump and dumps. Stick with bitcoin. 
I'm trying to follow this advice myself of course. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:14:34
Cards?? Where we're going we don't need cards...
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:50:09
I'm saying the wallet needs an api to do this FIRST. Then all exchanges will support it. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:07:16
I once got banned from the it suite at my school for running a program that blocked the reset button. It didn't occur to anyone that they could switch the machines on and off with the power button. The entire suite was 'down' for the day.  I didn't do it to be malicious, just wanted to see if such a thing was possible. 
After that they unsuccessfully tried to recruit me. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:11:17
What are the differences between this and Ethereum? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:37:02
The fact that you had to teach people kind of confirms my point. If you have to learn, its probably too difficult. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 07:41:19
fair enough, but it seems like a poor decision to have thousands of people downloading an uncompressed stream especially considering the file size is increasing all the time. For me this is a big factor in why I don't run a node.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:41:36
It would make more sense if exchanges didn't have customer wallets at all and instead you give them time limited access to your own at transaction time. The bitcoin wallet could be redesigned to do this. 
For example you decide how much you want to spend, and the bitcoin wallet automatically creates a separate address for those funds and only gives access for that address to the exchange. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:57:14
I guess I'm kind of at that point. The next few months are looking pretty difficult for me. I'm only going to sell my coins as a last resort. I'd buy in this week if I had any money left. Instead I'll be selling personal possessions to survive. 
My mistake was not taking a 10% roi in November. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:48:20
Have you ever worried that when you click send you made a mistake? I bet others have to think twice. I know I have. 
Even for a tech guy, you have to overcome that initial WTF factor about this process to make it seem real. This isn't an issue with traditional banks because they hide the difficulty for you. That's why people left money on gox. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:43:19
I could totally see gox being snapped up by a financial institution. It's the kind of opportunity that they are waiting for. 
Gox with real backing. If it happens you will all change your tune. Today starts the new era of bitcoin.

This Fucking sucks

money related sites usually take several days to go through the vetting process
@_date: 2012-12-18 13:03:36
what's the withdraw cost?
@_date: 2012-12-18 13:04:23
how do you get a better rate?
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:23:52
Done. It pretty much is that easy.
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:09:00
ah the number 1 rule of any customer facing business... talk to your customers. 
MtGox hasn't learnt this yet either. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:03:04
All the government's would spontaneously have to ban btc for it to drop below $10. This prof doesn't understand people at all. Hopes and dreams are what drives humanity.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:43:39
Can someone explain to me why this is the case?
I was under the impression that separate exchanges shouldn't be linked together in any way.
@_date: 2013-07-21 20:25:01
nasa has declared that there is a risk of high solar activity that could cause computers to malfunction. I don't have a link because I'm on my phone, but it could be that one day everything just stops working.. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:26:11
Barclay's blocked transferwise from dealing with bitcoins. So you missed that boat I'm sorry to say
@_date: 2013-02-18 08:47:29
you cant download without flash making it unuseable on mobile phones
@_date: 2013-07-04 08:05:35
US dollars aren't the only currency going into bitcoin you know.

nearly everyone uses or has contact with linux now in some shape or form,  idk what you are saying here.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:48:35
my first sale went well.  since then I've had nothing but flaky buyers who wont commit to a meet. I blame the recent  attacks and mainstream media. Localcoins is great with a small community. Enjoy it while it lasts, because it wont
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:00:52
I did a wire transfer days ago. Just fine.
@_date: 2013-06-13 06:33:43
doesn't this kind of remove any incentive to deposit money? It's like the worst business model ever. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 15:38:51
if there aren't enough customers, that's because there aren't enough good reasons to have bitcoins. Exchanges aren't really a barrier to entry as they are easier to get an account with than a real world bank. Nobody complains about opening bank accounts... Having more stores accepting bitcoin is the defacto way to increase demand. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 14:35:09
every one except the general public
@_date: 2013-09-14 03:25:41
What makes this better to use than already existing web wallets like block chain? 
It just seems less secure and more resource intensive... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:26:27
bitstamp is dead right now. I'm not sure what other European exchanges there are?
@_date: 2013-09-06 17:02:10
not their problem. our problem. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 06:19:04
you're wrong, cats who like to walk up and down their owners keyboards are the biggest untapped market. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:02:15
Is bitstamp any good? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:45:48
This sounds really useful. Would you be willing to post that here so we can all use it?
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:25:59
exchanges only care about bid/ask volume/withdrawal fees.
@_date: 2013-02-01 15:06:43
By your logic your mind or intelligence don't exist either. Physics doesn't cover everything yet. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:37:19
He'd seen those minted bitcoins,  and assumed that that's what a bitcoin was. Trying to explain bitcoin from a starting point like that is a challenge I can tell you.  In the end I refused to sell because he didn't really know what he was asking for
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:55:49
I'm not so sure. i met a buyer recently who said he wanted to 'see a bitcoin' before he would buy.   it scared me a little. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:37:47
ok I get what your saying now. Linux is doing pretty well now though, my hunch is that bitcoin will end up the back end to a host of mainstream payment methods much like Linux is now
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:43:26
time for a trip to Germany or Poland. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 18:42:37
The fate of bitcoin has little to do with the exchanges. Even if they all die tomorrow, the protocol would keep on trucking..
