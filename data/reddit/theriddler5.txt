If the block size limit is X, blocks can be X.


And what else are you confident will happen in the future? You don't happen to be Nostradamus?

Embedded merkle trees sound amazing:






Is there any code written? How much storage is needed on light clients for the SAV proofs?

It costed CoinWallet.eu $5,000 to fill up 1MB blocks. 8MB blocks could be filled up with their spam for $40k. So, you could "be seeing 8 MB blocks" if the block size limit were 8MB. Equally, you could be seeing 20MB blocks if the block size limit were 20MB.
is trying to arrange for continuously full 8MB blocks on testnet, which I strongly support as being a bare minimum stress test.

Yes, that was my point. You couldn't have predicted BTC's rise to $1000 in 2010, just like you couldn't have predicted BTC's astronomical rise in 2020, or 2025 causing blocks to fill up consistently. Funny how humans suck at predicting the future.


8MB blocks should be tested, because if block size limit is 8MB, blocks *can be* 8MB.

1. Which is more decentralized: a Bitcoin where you can sync a full node instantly on your home PC over Tor, or a Bitcoin with archival nodes as rare as the petabyte [IA.BAK]( backups?
2. Billions of people couldn't use the main chain if a hyper-Bitcoinization event occurred tommorrow. Would massive Bitcoin adoption tomorrow be a failure in your opinion?
Is it really so bad if people have to use centralized services, like they would if Bitcoin became a world phenomenon *tomorrow*?
In which future is free and open access more plausible?

When you were buying your first BTC, did the cost of an on-chain transaction enter into your mind?
Did you even know what a transaction fee *was* at that point?

Predicting the future is folly. If blocks can be X, they can be X. It's really that simple.
In 2010, I had all the confidence in the world Bitcoin wouldn't be worth $1000.

You used to have to wire money to a sketchy company in Japan or meet up with some guy in the street to acquire your first coins. The very minimum it would've costed you to acquire BTC was $0.25. You want me to believe an extra $0.03 fee for an on chain transaction would've stopped you? Well color me skeptical.


is completely orthogonal.
