So it's a withdrawal from Binance (Exchange site), using Agama (a crypto wallet used specifically for komodo coins). I used Binance to exchange my bitcoin for komodo (accoridng to the market price, no bargaining). So I didn't send, so much as extract from Binance using Agama. If it doesn't go through, does that mean recovery is possible, or the opposite? Yes, my balance on Binance is 0 and my balance on Agama is 0. So it's either stuck in between or at the wrong address. My wallet has not mentioned any confirmations.
I'm not sure that is where, try: RUdcP2G8dzWRrPF69Kq6R65eTFi84rxvQDm or RA4H5Nts41KRQAGQBCbpehWd1Ag1QbCVXg

Reassuring, although my methods of mass monetary decay are far less satisying!

Hah, thanks for these words of understanding.

Thank you! I'd like to think I am, although I'm not completely sure... post it where? Here?

It's about 150, not too much, but enough to be frustrating.

Thanks for your willingness to help.

Yeah, I recognize the patterns of irresponsibility in myself and in humans in general. 
So that's why I only used a fraction of the cash I set aside for Krypton Currency, I will invest despite this embarrassment,
Yes, I could've easily prevented this by more tediously comparing addresses.
Thank you for your encouragement, amazing how the most intelligent folks on earth (advocates of decentralized currencies) can be such warm people as well!
Best of luck to you in the future!

I don't know who owns it, but is there any way of finding out? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:17:41
Ok. Thanks.

No, I'm saying that I think I entered someone else's recovery seed on accident, and I don't remember what I typed or didn't type, so I can't get into the account. I could guess what I typed a couple times and I might get lucky. Thanks for your ideas!

Hopefully not.

The only conclusion that makes sense to me is that a small variation in my password seed caused me to log in to the wrong wallet, and to add coins into this wallet accidentally. So the address was generated similarly to mine.

I'm thankful for any perspective on this matter! I have tried searching the address on google with no luck. I have not dealt with vendors yet, as I am relatively new to this process, but thanks for the idea.
