You should sell your crypto, it's a leftist thing... Only leftists and liberals and cultural Marxists hodl.

nice one, I love your material ;)

Sigh... Americans...

Could be!

It's a valid theory, thank you.
I agree that I don't currently sense much fomo. Last time around, Q4 2017, I should have clocked and reacted to how I started hearing colleagues that know nothing about technology or investing talk about btc and investing in alts, etc.
I kept my cool, and pulled out some at the right time, but I feel like I should have pulled all of it and missed it...
I have some real life stuff to finance, and have an exit target, but if we don't get there, I want to pull at the right time...
To do that I need information, and I'm dumbfounded by what is happening right now, which is not a good thing to be!

How do you know it doesn't? I my se indiens about what they took into account one way or another.

Why this week specifically then?
@_date: 2019-06-07 06:58:07
Afterlife provably real? Damn... And we're supposed to take your opinions about anything seriously?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:58:19
I've been in this for long enough (2016), have gone up, stayed in, got down, and up again and need to finance some real life stuff. I'm thinking of exiting.

It wasn't, at all, 2 years ago

btw, that is exactly the point of the JP Morgan guy...
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:10:55


and you sound like you only read one word in a full argument.
Bitcoin needs an economy to power. People buying and selling stuff with it.
If it is just a speculative tool, it is a ponzi.
It has the potential to be the former, and I want it to be the former,  but the current focus on price prevents that, business cannot trade with the current volatility, it's too dangerous to them.
All that leave is the speculation.
And THAT was the core of the JP Morgan guy's argument
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:27:11
Yup, hence all the memes about the JP Morgan guy. The man made a valid point. Instead of responding to the point  he made, we had an avalanche of "DAE hate bankers" posts.
Bitcoin's way more than what plenty of users here seem to restrict it too: speculative tool.

Saying that the situation in Zim is linked to the banks is sort of rewriting history to match your pre-established beliefs.
The situation in Zim is WAY broader than "just" banks messing up...

Dude you're talking about the Euro here... not exactly a super-volatile currency.
That doesnt really help providing credibility for anything else you may say...
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:51:43
Thus is irrelevant to his central argument, which is unfortunately valid. To exist as a store of value, bitcoin must  be used as a currency more. We need to have an actual bitcoin economy, not just hodling

Woo, original, never heard this counter.
You know what he meant
@_date: 2019-05-24 09:05:57
Density is all I'm saying.
I don't want to have to navigate through discarded lemonade stands, the rubbish they generate, and the potential adults waiting to steal kids money.
Bad idea all round for a million reasons.
All good in less densely populated environments, a nuisance in packed places.
@_date: 2019-05-24 08:13:21
Even without force actually. Have you seen the density in NYC? How many kids' lemonade stands could the area take if even 10% of kids have a stand open at any one time? What about the rubbish they would generate? Those stands would become a nuisance sharpish and you'd have new yorkers navigating through live and abandoned stands all around their apartment blocks.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:24:01
Oh, I was wondering actually. Was that only delta messing up?
It's gone back down now
@_date: 2019-05-24 09:58:03
You sound mental mate, and ready for whatever gymnastics are necessary to be right. You assign whatever meaning to what I'm saying to make it work for you. 
You're right. You won. Over.
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:52:38
I always triple check btc addresses when I'm sending for exactly this reason... I'll give you that it's not designed for a stress free experience...
