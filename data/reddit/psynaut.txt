Even the Vietnamese switch back and forth between names, often in the same sentence. When I was in Hanoi in December, it took me several days to realize they were talking about the same place, because people used the two names in the same conversation.

Software glitch probably. No other explanation, really.

Since this is the stupid shit cops say, you are probably a cop, which means you are probably not smart enough to know that this is exactly the opposite of how the justice system is supposed to work, and it was set up that way because of how the justice system worked in other countries when the US was founded.
What you said is exactly the same as saying, "anyone who doesn't answer questions is probably guilty of something, or why would they be afraid to answer questions.?"
fuck off

If you were magically able to get the person who said this to tell the truth about his definition of "Weak Fundamentals" it would be something like, "I don't know, I saw someone write an angry Reddit rant about evil banks, and it just feels right, because I didn't get a 7 figure salary right out of college, so fuck the US and the dollar."
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:29:05
Well, the US dollar is essentially backed by the US economy.  They call it the "full faith and credit" of the US government, but that basically means it is backed by the entire economy.
I am not sure what your definition of "over time" is.  If you mean the last 50+ years, then the dollar is an example. If you mean centuries or thousands of years, then you are correct, currencies don't outlast the entire civilization that issued it.  Also, the post was about fundamentals, not whether it is backed by gold or seashells.
But let me put it back at you. Since my response was specifically in relation to a comparison about Bitcoin, and your criticism is specifically about that, then please explain to me what Bitcoin is backed by that will make it able to endure for thousands of years while the civilizations that created it come and go?  I'll wait too.

As someone who thought he understood bitcoin, but maybe doesn't, can you explain how Bitcoin provides a savings option free of speculation?
I thought you had to buy bitcoin, which then makes your investment subject to the price movement of bitcoin, which is insanely speculative right now.
How am I wrong?  How does bitcoin allow for speculation free savings, independant of the price movement of the underlying asset?

No, because the content of news is tailored to the intelligence of the consumer.  They give the people what they want.  I don't watch TV, but when I am forced to, like in a doctor's waiting room, and I see commercials, I am brutally reminded of the average intelligence of humans, who that content appeals to.

You do realize that the value of Bitcoin is tied to the Dollar.  Without Banks, and without the Dollar, there is currently no way to value Bitcoins.  When banks are gone, are you going to value Bitcoins by gold, or chickens?

I could be mistaken, but wasn't this quote actually posted on Twitter by Abraham Lincoln.

So stick your money under the matress then.  Its a product, nobody is making you purchase it.  Jesus, I don't whine when I buy an energy drink at the supermarket because I was born special and deserve free energy drinks.
@_date: 2019-09-28 04:02:11
But yes, I am sure you are correct.  I can learn a lesson from your empathy and insight.

I already know I will get downvoted to hell for this, but where do Millenials get the idea that banks and free checking accounts are a god-given human right?!  Banks are for-profit institutions, one of the most for-profit institutions on the planet.  They exist to make a profit. Their product is a safe place to put your cash where robbers won't steal it, and ease of payments with debit and credit cards.  But they don't do all this cause they are nice, or because you were born special, they do it to make a fucking profit for fuck's sake, yet every day some entitled douchebag bitches because his bank charged him a fee for something. JFC WTFF.

We have both been on Reddit for 10 years. I have seen hundreds of these posts, especially in the past couple of years.  Certainly, you must have seen a lot of them as well, if you hang out in some of the same subreddit I do.

Have you noticed that when the interest rate on your account is low, so is the interest rate on your house, car and everything else you borrow?  It works both directions.  If you want high-interest checking accounts, be prepared to pay 12% on your car loan. It is the cost of money and it is based on supply and demand like everything else.

Well... I have both Bachelors and Masters degrees in finance, plus I work for a large international bank, and I would be interested in hearing your explanation of how this affects bitcoin.

Thanks for answering the question, but you were a condescending little prick to the last guy who asked the question since he didn't have the financial studies to warrant a decent response from you, so I informed you that I had studied finance, and you are a condescending little prick to me too.
Maybe you are just a condescending little prick.  Hmmm, something to consider.
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:42:22
Well, you are wrong.  Going to college doesn't make you a troll.  You act like a high school kid.
