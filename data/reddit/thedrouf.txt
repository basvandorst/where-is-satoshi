Precisely, "or they go to zero". The risk of investing in Bitcoins is huge. Why people don't perceive that ?
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:02:00
Then people are stupid to invest that much.

Well if these investors are there just to surf on the bubble, it's almost impossible to do. The transaction delays and costs makes it extremely risky... The only people that can reasonable manage such risky investments are hedge funds.
But that's also my guess, we have an academic case of a speculative bubble with no fundamentals.

You're talking about the demand for Bitcoins. Why people would demand Bitcoins ? Because it is the currency of the future ? That's very unlikely. Why then do you think that there is a demand for Bitcoins ?

Tell me, was this a sarcastic comment about "This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly", by Reinhart and Rogoff ?

It's not because you value the benefits of Bitcoins that you are ready to gamble money. It's not like the money you are investing in Bitcoins will develop the currency (at least that's not the most efficient way). 
"all bets are valid because they are justified to the gambler" is a tautology. This is precisely the question, why these gambles are justified to the gambler. Biased beliefs ? Asymmetric information ? Irrational behavior ? 
Kalman Filters are common use in Finance, as stochastic differentials, signal filtering, or heat equations. Indeed, we formalize a lot of our arguments using tools from the engineering/math field. Sometimes it is justified and used in a clever way, sometimes it is complete bullshit. That's what makes the difference between a good and a bad article in Finance.

It's not blulshit, I try to characterize the behavior of investor. Apply a simple Kalman Filter to the Bitcoins today, and you can understand that the value of Bitcoin will tremendously decrease in less than 10 days. 
When the value of Bitcoins decrease so much, some persons are loosing a huge amount of money. Why the fuck they were taking that much risk in the first place ?

People putting their money in such a risky investment. The risk aversion that would justify such an investment doesn't make sense.

The point is:
(1) Bitcoins are not valuable in the present as a transaction good.
(2) If you count on the future value, it's still a huge speculation, as nothing is more uncertain at this moment than the evolution of Bitcoins. By essence, the present value of a Bitcoin is dependent of the optimism of people trading it, i.e. it is a pure speculation.

I am a PhD in Finance, and I genuinly would like to understand how people can justify themselves to invest in a speculative good, in such a risky investment with no valuation whatsoever.
