Very sorry for your loss. Don't let the bastards grind you down!

Any details about why India is such a tough nut, I'm interested

Let's just hope they store their private keys offsite.. Not that that will help all that much.

Really glad that part of this doesn't involve typing in the btc address of the recipient. "Damn you autocorrect!"
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:54:29
anyone else notice that the undercover agent had been involved since October 6, 2013.. Looks like they help them set a new one up right after they took the first one down.

This is how all good scams work.
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:07:04
Layoffs? How many people do you think work here? I'm starting to think you suckers deserve to lose your money. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 21:24:50
Coinbase is a scam. Do Not Use Them! 
So many reports of money debited and coins not delivered. Money in Limbo. There is a better way people!

Confirmation bias is high in this one. No doubt. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:06:29
You work for them too eh? Is this Shane? 
@_date: 2016-03-17 19:52:51
Yeah, cuz I only have one account. I just used the oldest one to try to give creditability because what I'm saying is true. I don't give a shit whether or not people believe me. I'll at least put the warning out and then I can laugh afterwards when you all lose your money. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:53:23
I don't have any proof that I can post. Most things worth doing in life require some amount of faith. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:15:01
Lol.. alright, I'll post a bitcoin address and once you guys have lost it all you'll reimburse me with your positive vibes right? I'm not even asking for anything. I'm not telling you to take them to site XYZ, I'm just telling you that coinbase is NOT a safe place to buy/hold your coin. I'm done. They obviously have people they pay to downvote any negative articles.. If you look at the top, there's a 50+ upvoted article about them adding some new feature.. Smart on them for gaming reddit. Sad day for bitcoin.

How can I prove it to you without breaking my NDA? I suppose you think that coder that testified about rigging elections was lying because he didn't provide the source. There's some features that are ONLY built for ONE REASON. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:54:34
Everybody who thinks I'm a joke can be "safe" and withdraw their money or they can roll the dice and not believe what I say. I've done my part. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 19:53:43
I can't give more evidence without possibly incriminating myself and I've got kids to think about. It's a web-based site selling pseudo-currency. How much evidence do you need? 
@_date: 2016-03-17 19:59:42
Insured by who? Look into the "company" insuring them. It ain't the fucking FDIC, that's for sure. Seriously, do you work for them or something? Is that you Henry? 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:02:30
alas, I'm remembering why I left now.. when I started using reddit, it was mostly about coding and mostly used by coders. Now we've had the eternal september effect magnified so much that it seems like reddit is mostly now run by hoards of minions employed by companies to whitewash real news like this post. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:11:55
What do you want me to do? Paste the memos? Paste the code? I'm trying to help people out here without getting my ass sued. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:12:40
Thankfully, coders like myself have the source code so we know that this isn't the case. Do you have access to the coinbase code? Because otherwise, there's a better chance I know what I'm talking about than you. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:21:05
Then you guys would be saying bullshit because it was a 'throwaway'. I've already stuck my neck out enough. I don't give a fuck. I've already got my money out. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:11:06
Finally, someone with a little bit of intelligence joins the conversation. 
I can't imagine people find this so hard to believe after gox, so many others I could go on for days.. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:56:15
This guy knows more than anyone else that's posted in this thread except me (and I can't say everything I know). 
Use common sense people. 
@_date: 2012-06-26 05:05:07
Got it too! Remember people, hover and check URLs! 
Take the openDNS Phishing Quiz to make sure you know how to spot fake URLs and forward it to old people who don't know this stuff. 
@_date: 2012-06-27 04:25:49
I agree it's completely common sense, especially for people with an IT/programming background. Still these scams wouldn't be so prevalent if they weren't often successful. I am a ninja as well but my mother got like 4/10. 
@_date: 2011-07-28 17:32:40
status quo is awesome! oh wait
