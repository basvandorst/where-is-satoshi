Hi everyone, [Justin from Coinbase here]( I apologize if you've experienced this issue. Please PM me with your ticket number and we will follow up shortly. Thanks!

Hi, [Justin from Coinbase here]( Very sorry for your experience and the delays in getting it addressed. I've replied to your support ticket and managed to get your issue resolved. 
The fact that you had to resort to Reddit is not something we take lightly. This is definitely not the kind of experience or customer support we're trying to provide, and for that I apologize. 
I’d like to take this opportunity to give a little bit of context on what’s happening. All of us at Coinbase are very committed to helping our customers and improving the experience. It’s our top priority at the moment. We are in the middle of a tremendous surge of public interest in cryptocurrencies, and when a company experiences hyper-growth it has a way of stressing many aspects of the platform, most notable are on the front lines with our support team. We are scaling up as fast as we can, but right now the ecosystem is growing just as fast. 
Issues from hyper-growth are good problems for a company to have, but it doesn’t mean they are not significant issues. The customer experience is poor for some of our customers right now, and you’re seeing a taste of that with your deposit being delayed for so long. I apologize for that, but I also know we are 110% committed to improving the situation for customers that have issues ASAP.
Bear with us, we will make this better, we will improve and be able to handle all of our customer’s questions and requests, and we will address your issues as quickly as we can.

Hi, [Justin from Coinbase here]( Those fees are **not** given to Coinbase. They are mining fees paid to the Bitcoin miners to validate your transaction and are a byproduct of Bitcoin's popularity. Too many people are trying to send bitcoin transactions with only a limited space available. This means only high-fee transactions will be confirmed in a reasonable amount of time. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:29:17
Hi, [Justin from Coinbase here]( I believe any BTC sent to your coinbase BCH address will automatically be credited to your BTC wallet. Conversely, if you send BCH to your coinbase BTC address it will automatically be credited to your BCH wallet. 
If this didn't happen, please PM me with a brief description of what's going on and your email address and I'll take a look. Thanks!

Hi, [Justin from Coinbase here]( I've resolved your issue as well and responded via your support ticket. Very sorry for the delays, this really is not the quality of support we're trying to provide. I've responded to the OP's main thread with a little bit of context on what's happening here. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 07:43:36
Hi u/charlesfries, very sorry about the situation here. I know it's not much of a consolation, but seeing good customer's purchases get cancelled is really frustrating for us too. And as trite as it may sound, we are making some significant improvements to how this will be handled in the future. But for now I'm sorry for how the rug was yanked out right under you. It's just poor service and I know we can do better. 
Just to be clear, purchases can be cancelled for a number of reasons -- not just because we suspect fraudulent intent. I really can't talk about the specifics of your case here, but I'm confident we can, at the very least, provide you with some clarity on the situation through our support channel. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 04:49:58
Hi u/BitttBurger, it does look a bit deceiving, but I checked on our end and your friend received the exact amount you sent (0.7189 BTC), there was no mining fee or transaction fee. The tx hash confirms he received this amount. But it does look like the USD amount reported via email can vary a bit, likely due to the exchange rate differences from when you initiate the transaction to when the emails are generated and sent. I'm taking a deeper look on our end, we'd like to make sure we're being up front on how this is communicated. 
I'd also like to point out that you and your friend should try our new Instant Send feature next time. This will let you send a USD amount of bitcoin and he can instantly cash it out without any exposure to bitcoin volatility. [Check it out on our blog.](
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:44:59
Yeah, I think we can do a better job communicating these things in general. It may also help if we don't mark your ticket as "resolved" and simply merge your open tickets instead. I've found your reply, we'll proceed there. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 03:54:28
I agree that it's a crummy situation at the moment. You can largely chalk this up to friction in the traditional banking infrastructure -- the exact thing bitcoin is innovating over. 
Since we have to pay a fee to our bank to accept a SEPA transfer, we have to pass the fee on to you, otherwise we would operate at a loss. We're constantly looking for ways to improve the experience for our customers, so if you know of a more economical option to send GBP to our bank, we'd be glad to look into it. 
It may be important to note that other countries don't impose a £5 fee, this appears to be a special circumstance for the UK. For example, ACH transfers in the United States cost less than a dollar, and we just cover that fee. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:12:59
Thanks for the info! I've found your ticket, we'll proceed there. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:26:31
Hmm that does seem strange, I'm not sure what happened there. I'd be happy to take a look for you and see if we can get it straightened out! Feel free to shoot an email to support (titled "Assign to Justin") or PM me your details if you'd like.

Hi u/cubicdissection, I'm sorry to hear about this! I've located your ticket and replied via email, so take a quick look there. Part of the confusion is that we did reply to an earlier open ticket regarding your account, and simply "resolved" the current one, but I can see how that can cause some confusion. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:37:26
Hi u/iiLezso, sorry we can't support you right now, our [User Agreement]( specifies that you must be 18 or over to use our services. Contact us when you're 18 and we'll be glad to get you set up! Best of luck until then. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 20:25:53
Hi just to be clear, the £5 fee is for the SEPA transfer from your bank to ours. We do not ultimately collect that fee, it goes to our bank as a fee they impose. 
You are welcome to explore other ways to fund your account, but in the UK we currently only accept traditional bank wires and SEPA transfers.

Hi Cannon-C,
Justin from Coinbase here. I'm really sorry for any confusion here! I'd like to take this opportunity to note that Coinbase will not deny services to users *just because* of Tor usage. That said, we must exercise caution when it comes to Tor &amp; VPN IP addresses, as these proxies may provide a veil for malicious actors seeking to defraud Coinbase or its customers.
Subsequently, if you are using Tor in conjunction with Coinbase, your account might be subject to a manual review but the majority of these cases result in no denial of services. In some cases, we may ask that you no longer access Coinbase from Tor, but this is a case-by-case determination. 
Cannon-C, as for your specific situation please review our correspondence, as it appears there has been a misunderstanding with regard to your account status. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:41:17
I just want to throw out that working for coinbase as a support rep has been amazing.

If you at all think you would be a good fit, apply!!

Hi dreadlocks, Justin from Coinbase here. I'm sorry to hear about your issues! We don't like it when our customers are having difficulties either, and sometimes good accounts get caught as well. I'd just like to let you know that I can personally take a look at your account and see if there's anything we can do. I can't make any promises, but I will give it my best shot. Go ahead and email support and ask to be assigned to Justin and I'll get right back to you!

I'm glad it worked out! And I'm very sorry about your first experience. We're working to improve our service, and we might not get it right 100% of the time, but bear with us and hopefully we can make it right in the end. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:04:13
I'll take a stab, but I'm on my phone so I can't give it a detailed response. 
Essentially, bitcoin as a raw protocol is impractical for large business to use as a payment method. There would be no easy way to validate incoming payments, match the customer with their order, or issue refunds -- let alone integrate easy shopping cart payment buttons for online retailers. But the real killer? Merchants would be exposed to bitcoin's volatility. And it's far too volatile right now for just about every business model. 
But honestly, all that doesn't even matter. By supporting coinbase, you are facilitating the growth of an inherently decentralized monetary system. In the end, it's about the consumer, and as more companies accept bitcoin, more people will begin to use it and realize it's value. You'll be working to *support* Satoshi's goals, not diminish them. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 00:52:11
Hmm that's interesting, thanks for sharing! What phone are you using, and what version of the Android Coinbase app? I'd be happy to forward this to our app developers. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:54:44
Hi u/DareDeviL84, sorry to hear about your struggles, it certainly sounds like there is something we need to clear up before you can buy bitcoin. If you DM me your case number I'll get back to you as soon as I can! Thanks, [Justin](

Hi, [Justin from Coinbase here.]( While there are a handful of reasons a purchase or sell could be cancelled after it has been initiated, these are rare events and absolutely do not have anything to do with price movements. 
I understand it may be difficult to just take my word for it, and I'm not sure what sort of proof I could provide, so you may just have to accept it. I will say that we always see more of these threads on Reddit during times of volatility, and people rarely complain on Reddit when we cancel a transaction that results in their favor.

That said, we are also rolling out instant purchases with bank accounts, and hopefully your account will be enabled for this feature soon!

Hi all, [Justin from Coinbase here]( 
We're investigating an issue where some customers recently were charged incorrectly for purchases of digital currency with credit and debit cards.

**We will ensure any customer affected by this issue is fully refunded.** We expect this to happen for customers automatically through their bank. If you believe you were affected by this issue. Please contact support at support.coinbase.com.

Hi, [Justin from Coinbase here]( This is the largest factor by far, great explanation. It's also a problem unique to crypto because Bitcoin (and other cryptos) are irreversible once withdrawn from Coinbase. 
Overall, securing our customer's funds and making sure criminals can't profit through crypto is essential to the ecosystem growing. But we know this is a poor experience today and we're working hard to improve it!
