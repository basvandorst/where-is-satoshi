Sure, and if Bitcoin crashed to 1 dollar you even would claim how this is good for Bitcoin.

Don't you people ever get tired of this shit? Seriously?
And downvoted of course. Yet when we go below 260 in a few days none of you will come back to upvote me.

5 days or next month. It doesn't matter. You will find excuses or simply ignore it. Anything but saying "i was wrong and look stupid". 
Because that's how you people work. Seen it 100's of times here. Especially with the crazies like you.

Yet if he used a normal bank he still would have his money. But let's just ignore the small details.

You would almost think this was all just a pump and dump. 
Yes, that's right, just keep downvoting it till it goes away. Then we can continue like this never happened.

Obviously. Just some fear taking us down before we go to the moon. 
And not simply a pump and dump like the previous 70 times. 
It's absolutely crazy to watch how this sub went totally insane just a week ago and posted moon crap non stop. It was a party here. I rarely seen anything like it. 
Anybody who even slightly suggested this would simply be a pump and dump got downvoted to oblivion. I've seen people getting 30 downvotes for such comments. 
And here we are. In the dump phase. And everybody is like meh, this is totally normal. We expected this. Just normal Bitcoin things. Cheap coinz. Move on. 
You people are crazy.
