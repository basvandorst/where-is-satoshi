I noticed too that sometime does not work :-(
Keep trying tomorrow, and maybe open another channel also.
Overall i'm pleased by the user experience, it will end up being something managed by the wallet without us even knowing.
I installed a testnet node and i'm gonna ask developers each time i have an issue.

I profited of the low fees to migrate everything to a segwit address.
Does it change something in the way i should calculate my transactions fees ?
Right now i watch this graph and pick up the appropriate 'band'.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:34:21
what's so uncool into joining the over 1000 nodes testnet network and signaling issues to developers?
with a thousand millibitcoin from faucets, you can test it to extreme by simulating whatever curiosity you can have
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:47:00
You can try this by installing eclair testnet wallet for android.
Once installed you have a testnet address.
Go to  and take some testnet bitcoin for your address.
Wait for the usual on chain 6 confirmations.
Once you have money, select autoconnect to create an automatic channel.
Select let's say 10 millibitcoin for the channel.
Wait for the channel to be established, with the usual on chain 6 confirmations.
Then go to  and order some fake instant coffee.
Whenever you're online you can buy coffee
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:07:16
I'm just suggesting people to join testnet for free learning. In half a week i have already seen some issues alerted in chat and new version of eclair node coming out.not saying that dev teams shouldn't use main net.

If it was worth 10 bucks, why did you bother setting such a Fort Knox ?
I wonder where you keep your nuclear codes...

Your bitcoin transactions are secured to be immutable in time by a stellar cpu amount/electricity needed to rollback.
Those resources are available because miners put them.
They are rewarded with seigniorage revenues as they can 'print' 12.5 new coins each block of transactions that get secured.

So far we have the same amount of eastern and western marks so the risk is balanced.
Would be could if the winner chain, if just one will emerge, will give the opportunity to absorb the other one at a fixed change.
Actually i don't know if i have to buy my 4th BTC or my 4th BCash :-)
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:11:50
let's hope not to have a dip!

I really can't be bothered into figuring it out for such a not life changing amount of zimbabwe dollars.
When the thing will buy me 10 years of retiring, i will eventually cash out.

have you read Antonoupolos "Mastering Bitcoin" already?
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:13:22
imagine to pick up two big prime numbers from a list
now multiply the two numbers together.
From the result is very difficult to figure it out the two prime numbers that produced your result.
If you know the factors though, it's trivial for you to do the multiplication.
The relation between a public and a private key is something like that.
It's a math function extremely difficult to invert.

not exactly an exchange but i took some last year from bitcoinromania.ro

Seems nice to me.
1) Don't you track also SegWit2x futures?
2) trying to track my transactions in portfolio....is the currency i sold fixed to usd ? it's greyed...
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:00:11
And there's a whopping percentage of people, even amongst owners of hw wallets, that confuse a segwit address with something that must related to the segwit2x hard fork
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:17:53
Well, it's not that simple, you can find some examples (with real numbers)  about how private keys and public keys are related here.
Lucky me i wasn't asked for Elliptic Curves at my cryptography cs exam some 20 years ago...
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:19:28
Maybe we will buy bitcoin using LN for real, then
We will consolidate just once in a while hopefully
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:41:03
I think that would be a great add to an already good service!
I buy crypto in a local european currency.
And if possible selling currency should be either fiat and crypto currencies.
As an example, after bitcoin cash hard fork i earned some btc by selling the bitcoin cash.
For the moment i said i got them for one dollar :-)
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:19:23
That's very interesting and frankly disturbing if it's true.
Anyway, if happened, it would be illegal, on many countries, to run a full node/ have a full copy of the blockchain.
That would be like having a downloaded copy of the illegal material.
If you don't run a full node you're relying on someone else having illegal material for you.

yeah, we can sense his neutral attitude to reach an informed opinion

what do you advise to use as mobile wallet?
i've got 0.0001 btc (~0.33 eur) on my phone with mycelium and can't even transfer out such a big capital :)
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:35:54
So can't they change that text, for clarity sake?
Holy cow, maybe we are getting worried for nothing
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:11:31
If you keep all your prefork BTC on a personal wallet (trezor/electrum/paper/whatever), they will be safe, provided that you don't add (pollute) post-fork BTC to the trezor.
As the fork is contentious, wait an unpredictable time until the market/ecosystem choose the side that will be still named BTC.
In the most favourable option, you will have equal number of coins and the losing side will still have a value allowing you to gain free money.
The biggest danger here is that this mess will greatly depreciate the 'fiat' value of your crypto funds
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:37:38
Isn't 'bit' the familiar name for μBTC so 0.000001 BTC ?
If so, that was cheap!
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:42:48
where can we see if some hashrate goes from btc to those chains ?
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:39:00
So a 18 years old boy, probably an european student, with 2000 euro of savings,  is asking how to make a prudent unemotional investment and you suggest to put 200 euro / month ? I think you put an extra zero.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:02:46
If you have your BTC on an electrum local wallet you control the keys so what to do after the fork is up to you.
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:19:18
If it will be a contentious one, it will be called bitcoin new.
Imagine exchanges giving you the opportunity to buy "bitcoin" and "bitcoin new".
Then trying to rename bitcoin as "old bitcoin".
Cash and gold got names that look like 'special edition medals'. Not really attracting the mass to migrate all the capital.

@_date: 2017-09-29 15:22:44
Guys, i used that 'pollute' word in an attempt to depict a scenario.
I't not a technical status, i'm by no mean an expert.
coming back to original 'safeness' question.
1) Read all the articles about segwit2x because REALLY is something big.
2) move all the BTC (other coins like BCH are not concerned)  to a local wallet where you control the key (electrum , paper wallet, hw wallet..)
3) don't mix in the same wallet prefork BTC (which both chains consider valid) with new bought BTC
until there are two chains claiming to be the real BTC
4.1)  would say also stop buying BTC for the same period
4.2)  if you had the impellent urge to invest in BTC (can't you buy other coins?) during the chaos and the likely huge dip at least put those on a separate wallet.
4.3)  summing together different coins that exchanges pretend to be the same can lead to impossibility to split even what you had before

my heart is broken for "the rich senator's son that learned about bitcoin from a drunk friend at Harvard, and now that lost 60% of the six-figure loan his dad gave him"

@_date: 2017-10-13 12:10:36
A couple of nights ago i had a nightmare where the mess created by having two chains with similar names, without proper replay protection, and basic services selling apples for oranges was such a big reputation loss that scared the market and the newcomers so much than the combined value of the two coins was well below last month value.
Then i got awake to an ATH
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:03:08
Unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:11:17
I propose 'heavy bitcoin' ,'lira pesante' or 'republic credits' with a nice aurebesh ticker
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:42:03
Don't count on my word for such a big amount of money!
My suggestion is to stop investing for a month, maybe two.
With Bitcoin Cash fork everything was simpler because they implemented the famous "replay protection" thus splitting the coins between BTC and BCH was straightforward.
As of now Coinbase strongly support Segwit2X.
I'm under the *impression* that if coinbase sell you a Segwit2X coin calling it BTC, you add it to your wallet balance and then Segwit2X chain defeat to takeover the brand BTC, all your trezor BTC are 'unsafe'.
Maybe, if you are so exposed, you can buy another trezor and use it for your post fork funds until the thing got clarified.

if you're are using Shapeshift to sell your BCH for BTC, better to do it before mid november

that 'bit' colloquial reference for **microbit**coin is so confusing.

I don't get this hype about this premined btgold.
Probably it will be worth less than a Muttley medal.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:05:40
this look like bitcoin pyrite
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:53:25
but if miners stop mining that will decrease hash power triggering a difficulty adjustment. So mining bitcoin will be cheaper and that is an incentive for mining
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:44:27
any registerless service willing to dump segwit2x for btc?
i guess shapeshift won't.
@_date: 2019-09-09 13:01:01
There are some credit cards tied to crypto wallet.
I wonder how taxes can be calculated in case we start converting to fiat each time for normal life payments.
Would end up in a mess
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:35:11
As it's still a geeky thing, i think is very likely those small funds, given to uneducated(to bitcoin) relatives, will not be appreciated and end up being lost.
So why do it? 
To prove your nerdness ?
Keep them on their name without saying.
If you ever get 'rich' in whatever period and by every mean (maybe you won the lottery or invent a disease remedy), i'm sure you will share with your loved one
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:35:54
Will shapeshift support trading between the two chains resulting from the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:39:00
Maybe this could be a service that normal banks should offer for a fee.
Matched with the capability to cash out in fiat money if the heir decide so.
Then i guess it depends on how much your crypto is worth in your total balance.
I should study smart contracts :-)
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:31:43
Who wrote proper replay protection for Bitcoin Cash?
That served the purpose.
Can't they copy it ?
So wallet developers can start working on splitting tools ...
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:40:40
It's not just the BTC quotation in dollars.
Maybe you have 0.1 BTC, maybe you have 10 or 100 BTC.
It's when the amount you have collected so far, better if just a part of it, can be exchanged for a life changing sum.
(10 years of salary, extinguishing debts, a house).
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:00:31
