At least central banks are attempting to understand blockchain. Say what you will with regards of centralized blockchain, but its a fact that the more eyes on this revolutionary technology, the better and better it will improve. Of course, having an open community like the one digital assets has is the best way to approach this.

Cracking up at all the comments suggesting to turn it on and off. Reminds me of any IT customer support hahaha.

Ethereum is at a rise while Bitcoin has remained at a cool 11k. The time for Bitcoin to rise could happen in the next weeks as US tax returns will be issued out. New influx of money coupled with the rash and limited-knowledge trader will make the overall market, and more importantly, Bitcoin rise. Just my personal opinion though.

I've been thinking about that, it'd be pretty cool if you got a notification that the SL hit and the ability to buy back in with simple sms. Another cool thought would be to have volume and price change indicators to understand when its probable that the price is leveling out and allow you to buy back in. If it drops even further, repeat the process with the SL. Of course, thats the optimistic creator/investor within me but a system could be created.

You said that then but now I have all my fiat to buy back in at this low.

If you are informed and look at key indicators, stop losses can prevent FUD movements, in my opinion. Curious to see, how do you manage your risks?
