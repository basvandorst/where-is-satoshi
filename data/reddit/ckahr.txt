Well they told me to pound sand.
@_date: 2015-12-22 14:19:22
I'm saying you should avoid gyft
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:52:14
don't reach out. they will tell you to pound sand.  just avoid them like the plague.
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:49:13
what ever you do don't buy a gyft branded card first to use to divvy up into walmart cards of different denominations.  They will not give you your 3% back if you buy one of their cards.  I know its super stupid.
Or just do what I've done and never give them a fucking satoshi again!
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:52:37
no that doesnt work cause Gyft fucking sucks
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:32:18
I want other people to move on from using GYFT too.
@_date: 2015-12-19 11:44:19
This isn't an indictment of btc. It's gyft and its shitty policy.  I posted here because I thought it was relevant to Bitcoin supporters like myself.
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:49:59
I did not have that same experience last week.
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:08:55
You had me til the last sentence 
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:31:59
OK, how about they said it says it in their terms of service that no one bothers to read past "3% rebate for bitcoin" and that I would not be getting my rebate.  Would you believe that?

Thanks for the reply. I'm sorry for any confusion regarding my previous email and for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We may change, suspend or terminate the Gyft Points program, or any part of it, at any time and in our sole discretion. I have included the terms of service for our Gyft point program below as reference.
You can still earn Gyft points towards any of our other retailers as long as no Gyft points/promotional codes are used towards purchases made directly on Gyft.com.
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:51:35
this is the truth Gyft fucking sucks.  I've spent over 1K with them this year and they didn't give me my 3% back on my most recent transaction for 5 cards because I bought a gyft branded card first to only have to do one BTC transaction.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:00:07
my silver dealer still offers a 3% discount.  
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:01:52
You're really missing the point.
I'm not upset about the lack of reversibility with btc I'm annoyed that buying their branded card doesn't give rebate like doing 5 separate btc transactions would.
I'm trying to warn people from gyft not btc.

@_date: 2014-08-19 13:50:56
I'm relatively new to the bitcoin world myself but does anything really need to be transferred?
Doesn't WU just credit one account here and debit one account there? 
I do think WU rates are likely high from a lack of competition but I don't think they are too far out of line only because Goldman, and HSBC and Deutsch Bank haven't already drank their milkshake.
If it really is as big as OP portrays wouldn't the big money already be competing in this field?
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:00:57
And it's not pointless as you said in your first comment.
If someone is looking at investing in BTC they need to compare the costs to other potential investments, no?
@_date: 2014-08-28 00:52:37
I'm talking about spare fiat being auto deposited in BTC
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:22:05
how does community uproar work?
ELI5, do I get to determine who processes my sale of coin to you?
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:17:53
Are you serious?
You understand BTC is one avenue someone may chose to invest in?
That they could just as easily invest in a gold mine, or gold mine stock.  That gold mine has a cost per ounce.  The price differential between the cost to mine and the market cost determines if the mine stays open.
If the cost to mine BTC becomes to high in relation to the cost people might invest in other industries, no?
If they invest in other industries the price of coins will do what?
How will that effect the holder of coins?
Should that person looking to invest look elsewhere for investment opportunities?
Do you not see these are questions that someone might want to know the answer to before dropping money into the market?
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:45:26
did you get your law degree out of crackerjack box?
@_date: 2014-08-28 00:51:53
I don't want a counterparty "investing" the money for me. I want my spare change to automagically buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-08-09 00:09:34
I agree its cheaper and easier.
I disagree with the TL;DR though.
The point of my question was more about the health of the BTC market/economy.
If there was no profit motive to mine, no mining, no market, cratering price.
I'm more concerned with downside risk than upside potential.
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:39:58
This is an interesting perspective but I'm not sure I agree. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:07:32
I understand, I fail to see the point.
What do those new cards or ASIC cost?
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:21:20
Thank you for your time BTW.
If an entity could posses enough computing power to find 51% of the blocks what could stop them from doing so?
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:28:15
tattoos are photographed by officials when arrested and put into database in case tats match other crimes.
12 words tattooed would still be open to others and if they put them in correct order they would have key. now 11 words tattooed, and one in your mind with the correct order would be extremely secure.
assuming of course you don't get beat to a pulp for the word and order by your new friends inside.
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:14:46
I agree with everything you typed but that ain't the republican party.
what you described is more accurately minarchism. and nary it and gop will meet.

forgive my ignorance here but what would happen if a court order was sent to coinbase to freeze/turn over accounts?
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:25:26


Sure you did, when you said the question was pointless in your first comment.
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:28:13
Can you expound?  Yours is the only comment here that actually addresses the point in the post.
I'm relatively new to this.
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:04:30
Also, if someone were able to hook up their computers to say a Thorium reactor with a cheaper per MW cost, they could mine more effectively/cheaper. Changing the cost. 
Kinda like finding a new vein of gold.
So to be frank, I don't see how you don't see how I could disagree.
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:57:31
Well I disagree because BTC does have an actual real world cost from the cost of equipment, and the cost of electricity.
Oil and gold have costs based on geography as does BTC (via the price of electricity).  
That's not arbitrary.  
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:05:35
So what if it is arbitrary?  It is still a real world cost in electricity isn't it?
@_date: 2014-08-28 13:57:46
It's not my program I don't know. I do have some guesses though.
First, you pick which pattern you want to follow, whether that's very conservative on up to hyper aggressive. I would imagine they pool the money from every investor in each pattern and make the investments accordingly. And when you cash out they have an algorithm that determines your share based upon how much you invested and when you came in, etc.
Two, they may have gotten funding after showing someone what their potential user base and potential cash flows in was projected to be. They may be investing that money today with the goal of paying you out based upon your investment over time.
But like I said in another comment I'm more interested in a way of having my spare change every transaction going into buying BTC and not being invested by "expert" counterparties.
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:35:19
If you read  the link in the top rated comment you would see that the price of a coin is almost exactly the cost to mine the coin.
I'd say that it has a tremendous relation to it's value.
@_date: 2014-10-25 20:17:31
what I suggested a couple of months ago. a api that tracks my purchases via my debit card in dollars and rounds up the change and buys btc with it.
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:58:16
It does help.
Assume I transfer a coin (only ever traded via coinbase)
How do I make sure Ghash doesn't process or be the only entity that has the authority to process my coin?
what does anger towards ghash do, I mean substantively.  What prevents another entity from doing the same?

That is exact opposite of what I said.
@_date: 2016-10-19 03:33:01
1. I think the IPCC isn't for the US benefit. I agree with that.
2. ""I am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time. Same exact amount," yeah sounds like a real bad idea there.
3. You'll have to forgive me for not taking an editorial at one of the most liberal publications as gospel.  I think it could have some good side effects.  If it keeps Mexicans in Mexico maybe they will fix Mexico?
4.  nothing racist about it.  islam is open to all races.  
5. From the yearbook:
@_date: 2016-10-19 03:18:04
No one denies Climate Change.  People don't agree on the severity of it, or the idea that it is all man made. 
I've not heard Trump say that about vaccines. 
I'm not sure the wall would be useless.
Obama was the original birther.  Look at his bio from the Harvard Law Review. 
I'm fine with checks that keep out muslims.  
I have quite a few Jew, Christian, Women, and Gay friends and a daughter.  I know how islam views all of those groups and I'd like to keep my daughter as far away from that as possible.
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:29:59
There is a scene from a movie and I don't remember which one it is. But it was premise was an employee had figured out how to remove many levels of inefficiency.  But it was that inefficiency that afforded him and everyone in the office with a paycheck.  In short, the card that you are looking for would remove large amounts of profit from banks and they have no incentive to bring it to market, even though it is likely very simple.

I don't agree with him on every issue.  Expanded police state would be one I disagree on, stop and frisk I don't think is constitutional. 
Islam isn't religion its a virus.  He wants to stop them from coming here I'm fine with that.
Trump isn't running in a vacuum, He's running against HRC and I don't think the WORLD would survive 4 years of her.  I think nuclear war with Russia is better than 50% occurrence with HRC as President.
@_date: 2016-10-19 00:41:22
I agree with your assessment completely.  Add in the fact that Russia is preparing for war is HRC wins and it makes it a no-brainer for me.
