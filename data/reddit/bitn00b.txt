The reason this technology is so exciting is because it makes a lot of things possible that have never been done before.  We're *trying* to break the status quo now through this technology, but it's uncharted territory.  If you want to be a part of that, come along!  But nothing about investing in bitcoin is "safe".  I have invested a great deal of my own savings in bitcoin because I believe it will change the world.  But as everyone is always saying, "Don't invest what you can't afford to lose."  The possibility of bitcoin dropping to $0 is quite real.

That's because Mark didn't use Open SSH.  He implemented his own SSH server in PHP.  If Gox had lasted until today, that would have really paid off!

This is pretty retarted. There isn't a security issue. It's just a privacy issue, and it's really not one that's that big of a big deal. If this is the biggest "security" risk Coinbase has, I'm going to move my coins out of my paper wallet and back into Coinbase.

What happened to the coins?!!  Were they stolen? Were they lost? Show us on the blockchain!

Whoa, that post that was just deleted was so informative. What happened to it???

It's clear that this catweider guy thinks of himself as a 1337 hacker / security expert.  He thinks he found an exploit and is being a baby because Coinbase wouldn't pay him for "finding" this crap. So lame

I don't know the answer, but keep in mind that the quote says this problem was fixed in 0.6.1, so whatever reasons may make you think this isn't a problem may not have been true before 0.6.1.

What's this about? Someone mind filling me in?

If they were really leaking home addresses that would be a real privacy issue... but the linked report doesn't say anything about that.

Thank you! That was just the hint I needed after 20 min of trying different variations on  I knew exactly what it was referencing, but I couldn't find the right phrase until I read this. Going to wait until I have a confirmation behind me to reveal the answer :)

I'm not on there... been a Coinbase customer since December. I wouldn't be surprised if this was FUD and these emails came from another source.

2 months of living expenses for the US in 2011 bitcoin prices would be worth a TON of money today.

Totally agree.
