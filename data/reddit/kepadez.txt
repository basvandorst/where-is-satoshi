2X for every bitcoiner, we have two choice, you can use main chain or lighting. 1X or BCH give me only one choice. I have bitcoin before 2017, so I have all bitcoins and fork coins. Choice is so important,  so many thing for me have no choice in China. So I hope 2X success, give me choice.

This post just a joke. Too young too simple, sometimes naive. Current Hong Kong is not the Hong Kong before 1997, everything is under control and monitor, Li Ka-shing has escapsed from Hong Kong to Europe. Hong Kong have no future. In China, gov control everything, from your born to your death, your house and your children and your all life. You have nothing belong to you.
Richer always escape the cage, but the pool guy just can stay in the cage to die.

This crash caused by china hot money esacape, and this crash is unreasonable. Most chinese just think it's a make money tool,
not like it as a freedom curreny. And may some bankers try to get big profits from this crash.

You don't know the real china. You just look the earth in the noon.
I don't know where are you come from, you talk about the freedom in china is so ridiculous. And how about the recently air? Open your internet, 
just open the baidu news, give me some explain about the freedom.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:49:59
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:54:07
Please forget China.
China is shit.
Btc will grew faster without china.
Don't fantasy a dictatorship country.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:34:58
Huge china hot money will go to Mtgox. China Yuan is so cheap in china inland, but it's appreciation in international. I think China economy will crash very soon as BTC, haha. It's time to buy btc in china. I have checked Mayzus, it seems very easy to use it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:12:44
We trade btc/ltc never through any bank.
We think btc/ltc is network gold in china.
This is really a good news.
Chinese richer trust this and join this btc/ltc family.
I believe the price btc/ltc will go to moon.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:46:41
This is a very good news
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:06:21
China is shit.
RMB is shit.
CPC is shit.
China government fear any freedom stuff.
CPC original are bandit, they are bandit too.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:18:47
 sure, btc/ltc is become a virtual goods now. You can trade it in trade platform like BTCChina, OKCoin.  For the long term, we don't worry 
about the trade platform disappear suddenly.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:31:35
Sure, Why not?  
In china, current trade process as following: 1, Put your money into the trade 
platform by online bank. 2, by btc or sell btc . 3, Withdraw your money to
your bank account. It's very easy.

@_date: 2013-12-10 11:48:24
just for this part
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:35:46
I think this is the real reason why btc/ltc huge crash before days, The national team of china is join to collect ltc/btc
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:25:35
That's RMB service, not btc service, currently, every platform is so happly to get this news, because is legal now for their trade platform.
You can buy and sell btc freedom, no any block here. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:14:08
The trade is too much and the web is dump.
Because we have a really good news
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:52:35
And the china government let's the BTC as a goods is legal, let's the trade platfrom is legal, chinese can trade it freedom and safely. I truely believe it's a positive news. especially for long term. China government lost the finally chance to be a real powerful country. China just a eunuch country, big but have no penis. China government scared every new things.
