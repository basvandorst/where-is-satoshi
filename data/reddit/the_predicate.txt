What does this mean for the common bitcoin holder?
Can somebody do an ELI5 version?

I like to use Electrum and Multibit. I also have a blockchain and coinbase account.

Will my wallet software update for this automatically? Or do I need to go in and set the fees manually?
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:35:40
Ahhh okay that makes much more sense. It seems like the best way is the wallet that you store on your computer yourself. I think I will keep the majority of my money on my computer and just keep a little bit online when I need it. I am still confused on the fees that are charged though as I move money around and the time frame on how long it takes.

I suppose I should admit that I and for a smaller government and less regulation, but I understand the reality that our tax money keeps a lot of things going and without people paying taxes, something will have to change dramatically.

Thank you so much! That was instantaneous. I see that there was a .0001 fee charged to you though. Does the fee change on the size of the transfer or is that a standard no matter the amount?

Thanks for the advice. I will keep that in mind. I wish I would have thought about my purchase a little more yesterday as looking at the exchange rate right now I bought at the high yesterday haha. Hopefully it goes back up and continues to rise even more. I want to tell more people about this because it seems like such a great idea, but the volatility will scare a lot of them off i'm sure.

I have an IPhone and as I have been looking into this topic it seems that for some reason Apple wont allow bitcoin apps :( 
Is there a way I can still at least keep track of my accounts on my phone without actually using the BTC?

Am I the only one that looked at the picture and it all went way way over my head?
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:20:53
I there a generous redditor out there that would donate $.01 to my wallet so I can try a transfer please? 
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:40:54
Can a guy get some proof around here?

If you wanted to cash out a bunch of your addresses, what would stop someone from following to that address? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:58:19
Do you know of any good tutorials on setting up an offline wallet similar to what you described? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:18:26


Will you expound on this just for my own knowledge as to why this is a bad idea? I made an account on blockchain and now that you mention it i am looking at multibit, but that seems like it would be a pain if I am not on my personal computer. Can this program be on a USB I can carry around?
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:18:38
Okay this issue is becoming clearer to me. Thanks everyone for your input. Just as a hypothetical side question, wouldn't having hundreds or thousands of addresses become ridiculous to manage and backup if you were receiving lots of payments from different people?
Maybe this is a stupid question but, also is it possible to eventually see bitcoin in general run out of new address to issue?
