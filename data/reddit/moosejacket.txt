Awesome

I appreciate your response!

Just curious, why have they rejected it and what do they think will solve the issues instead? Thanks in advance.

How popular is bitcoin in Thailand? Isn't it a pretty cash based economy to the average masses?

Great letter, too bad this Senator probably doesn't give a shit about anything that isn't green and in his pocket.

But what about the internet, man

First two-way ATM.

I do not have an old extra laptop hanging around that does not hookup to the internet.
What is the safest and most efficient way to store my BTC? I'd also like to be able to store a backup in more than one location.

Don't hesitate to contact his office again.

This is cringe worthy now, what is the context of this video?

Wish Texas had a rep here, thanks for the info.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:57:23
Maybe and obvious answer, but is Coinbase/other companies working to add calculating selling/buying/spending/accepting for users? Meaning, I don't have to keep track when I use Scottrade or another broker, they send me the tax documents I need.

I've had 3 cases of beer since I started this comment.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:48:39
Why? That person know has a large amount of BTC and will be rewarded when the price eventually rises.

We'll go down together brother

This may be a stupid question, but as an individual investor, is there a way to invest in Coinbase (aside from joining them and getting options) or do we all have to wait until they...dare I say...IPO?
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:57:13
Does anyone else feel more comfortable trusting Coinbase than securing their BTC on their own (cold storage/paper wallet/old computer etc?).
At least if I lose it all on Coinbase, I have someone to blame other than myself and could have the chance of getting it back in a lawsuit/whatever if they lost it. I know this is silly and you should be your own bank, but man I lose shit all the time.
Anyone else?

That's how bitcoin will get a worse name. Not spam, but inform him.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:41:52
This helps traders not the average BTC community comeonnn blockchain!

Oh Chuggin Monkey, how many nights I spent pounding cheap beers till 2am on 6th street.

Is this safe? What can someone do with your API key? Not that I don't trust Mint already, but just wondering. Thanks for the update!

Wells Fargo exchanged my USD for Thai Baht...Is Wells Fargo now an exchange?

I want so bad for Coinbase to be good.

Are we sure this is not another Sacha Baron Cohen prank?

Why not always buy? Dollar-cost average.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:28:26
Is there another option we can use instead of social security 
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:32:49
Praying that it gets to $11 so I can buy all of it.
@_date: 2014-03-22 02:41:23
Could have an "other" field or just make it a text field.
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:27:41
Bought around the same time you did and have buying every time it dips. [Dollar-cost averaging]( FTW!!

Oh man that's beautiful and I want to make this. Can I get a PM of any tips, write ups, or things you would have done next time? Really interested in this project. Thanks!

No problem, I only know because I just learned as well :)

Have you maxed your Roth IRA? 401K? HSA? Have you paid off all your debts? 
Don't rush into anything, read a few personal finance or investment books first. Bitcoins are very volatile, don't put all your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:14:26
It sends it to their reddit bitcoin wallet unless they do not have one set up, which it will then set up one for them. If you get a tip it also will allow you to transfer it into your own wallet. This comes though the messages inbox.

Been holding BTC as a long term investment, but really wanted to make my first purchase to see how it worked.
This was it, and hopefully now my girlfriend will think BTC is a little more interesting and useful.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:37:20
Going to create a kickstarter? I'm interested.
