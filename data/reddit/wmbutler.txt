I helped Flyte ( get set up in Nashville, TN. I ended up getting them a Nexus 7 tablet (which looks a lot like the leather check that people get at a table). We installed coinbox ( an Android App on it. You are able to put in your Coinbase OATH credentials and it will clear the transaction while they wait. It's a little clunky, but with some training it works fine. They decided to let the bartenders manage it for any tables that need to cash out. I believe coinbox has a beta for BitPay which may be a smoother process, but download it for yourself and give it a shot.

And here was their response:
Hi Bill,
Thanks for using Harvest and thanks for the suggestion! Bitcoin payment is a feature request we've received before and it's on our radar. We're not currently developing this feature, and it's not in our plans for the near future, unfortunately.
Let me know if I can help you out with anything else! Thanks again for using Harvest and taking the time to write to us!

I believe a distributed exchange will be BitShares first DAC. You might consider investing in protoshares to take advantage of the myriad of DACs that will come from this.

Please pull your account. Oh, and would you mind recording the conversation? That should be priceless.

Nah, let them lose a customer. Capitalism takes care of these things the natural way.

Slightly off topic, but a drunk date night is also doable with very little effort.

Yep :)

My letter addressed this exact issue.
