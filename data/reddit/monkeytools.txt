Venezuela was backed by a government now look at then. America is good though our government isn't as corrupt as some. There's room for both. This shouldn't be us or them. It's what payment method would you like to use? Bitcoin, cash, check, or card?

I believe in bitcoin as a currency without the political view of anarchy
