What plans/ options you are talking about? Its the BTCs that were stolen, not USD or ETH or LTC. Those should be returned back unaffected. Ideally even BTC should be compensated fully as they were under custody of Bitfinex. We have already been cheated on Jun/20, haven't we?

I AGREE. I should have read this post earlier, at least before my last transaction with them on Jun/06, 2016. I sent $1500 to Coinbase and they got deposited in USD wallet after 5 days on EOD Jun/10. Then I bought coins from that USD wallet on Jun/13 morning and the coins are still "Pending" (which were suposed to be INSTANT), yes till now Jun/15 2016 12PM EST. Since then I have created couple of tickets (Case   sent many emails, but no response from Coinbase except the automated replies. Three days, no response from customer support. What else can that explain but EXIT SCAM? My sense is that NO ONE is there at Coinbase, no human being. You only get automated canned responses. All automated actions of the website are active but they have already "left the building". But that's my sense. I still hope all is good and I'll get back my money. Fingers crossed! I will update here if/when I get my coins/money.
Update (06/16/2016): It took 3 days for Coinbase to wake up and resolve the issue. No explanation provided what was wrong. Anyways, all good. They are alive!

Was it a sell order or buy order? If buy order, how did you do it, meaning Instant/ from Bank/ from USD wallet? Coins available at site or withdrawn successfully?
