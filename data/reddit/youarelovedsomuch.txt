Exactly. Why would anyone ever spend bitcoin? Just buy it because one day it will overtake the current financial system, which means everyone will be using it to buy stuff with, which means it will be worth tons of dollars, which you will be able to sell the bitcoin for in order to buy stuff with the dollars.

75 sat/b is extremely small. Average fees now are 200-500 I believe. Please read [this link]( in full.

Yes, please do read. It will help you understand the why.

Everyone is experiencing this. Currently there are about 200,000 unconfirmed transactions, waiting to be confirmed. This fee issue has been rising in bitcoin for a couple of years now, and there are no current solutions scheduled to fix this (segwit does not fundamentally fix it). I explained this issue in great detail here, in [this link]( which I greatly urge you to read. Hopefully this clears things up for you a bit. If you have any questions, let me know.

If you mean they can send and receive without half of it going to fees and waiting 5 hours, I would say it already is. Bitcoin has been declining in merchant adoption for several years (Steem just dropped it the other day).

Yes, you're right. The guy you're arguing with a reddit user who's a massive fan of the Lightning Network. Here's a more balanced view of the situation I wrote earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:35:35
The fees are high because there are more transactions happening than the network can handle.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:57:16
Average fees now are 200-500 satoshi per byte. This comes out to about $15 on average _per transaction_. It is part of a much bigger problem going back years. You can try to bump it, or just wait. Eventually it will be returned to your wallet if it doesn't confirm within a week or two. Please read [this link]( in full.

They accept bitcoin too.

Lol. Bitusher is known Core enthusiast. Here's a comment I wrote about the Bitcoin scaling situation that's a bit more balanced. [link](
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:21:11


Yes, but this is due to the fees of the Bitcoin Network itself. I wrote about the brewing fee situation a bit [here](

You need to understand how much is going on in the background right now. Here's somewhat of an overview I wrote about where Bitcoin is currently at. You may want to take a look. [link 1](
It is an extremely speculative and volatile investment. Never invest in something you don't understand, and always be comfortable with the idea of losing everything you invest. Be aware that this is a long-term investment. Think years, not weeks. Prices will fluctuate dramatically.
Here's a good video I recommend (ignore the title). [link 2.](

Mike Hearn left in disgust years ago.

Cool. Let me know when people are using it practically.

Good post

No, I bought it on beesbros.com with bitcoin cash.
Feel free to actually research the wesbite yourself. If you want to use bitcoin cash, you just email them first.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:44:42
This is so disgusting to me. Nothing about making the world better. Nothing about the reason Bitcoin was created. This is what Bitcoin has become, and this sub. Disgusting.
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:14:31


Bitcoin has lost that for a long time. Luckily there are other options which will continue it. 
Edit: As well as places to discuss it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:58:07
I would respond but one of my replies was already $h It was nice conversing with you.
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:51:32


False (statement from other user). I upvoted you and gilded you because you came there on your _own accord_,  _despite_ what others had said. You were _genuine_ in your curiosity, and seemed like a nice guy. I want that to be crystal clear. You could have said something like "I have observed both communities for a while now, and to me, both look highly toxic at times. Why are you guys any different than them? Genuine question."
Would not have gotten you downvoted at all. Something like this: "R-btc is extremely toxic and horrible for bitcoin" _would_ have. There is a very distinctive difference. And no, the community is not perfect. But if you are genuine and respectful, you will generally do fine.
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:28:14
You're looking pretty desperate Adam. u/evoorhees has been extremely kind to you, and Core in general- much kinder than I have been. You have no reason to be mad at him. It's your guys' fault that you refused to go along with a 1mb blocksize increase. Bitcoin is not yours, and it never was. I have a say too in how my bitcoins are run, in _my_ money. Who are you to tell me that your minority 1mb chain is Bitcoin? If you want 1mb, fine, but you will be left behind, even with all the attempts by Core and supporters to squash other views. Core's willful ignorance, toxicity, and refusal to compromise, is going to cost them everything, as it should.
If this comment gets $h I will post it publicly in multiple other forums.
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:19:41
I am a big fan of yours Erik, but I don't believe the other forum is as bad as this one. Yes, you see similar types of behavior. But I don't agree they are equals. In fact, I just got done posting a comment about how while I disagreed with you on some issues, I still respected you.
@_date: 2017-07-03 01:44:21
You mean like any person who owns more than 8 bitcoins? Which would basically be any serious miner, or anyone involved with bitcoin for a while? That number will go down, too, as bitcoin goes up in value (current price around $2500)

You guys talk about what a fraud he is and how he isn't the creator of bitcoin, etc. etc., while ignoring the fact that every one of his points was spot on. I don't care if he's Satoshi or not. He's completely right. He's not trying to take control of bitcoin. He's trying to free it by letting the market choose the best product.
