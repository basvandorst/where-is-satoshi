I just did this last week. I have gigabit internet and it still took from Monday afternoon until Saturday sometime to do a full sync.

I'm on the opposite side. I was mining many years ago, to try to pay for more GPUs and computer equipment for gaming. I sold \~15 BTC over a 1 year period, for $100-200 each.

That just sounds like stealing with extra steps.

I'd love to see a good comparison of these various software suites for those of us just starting research on the topic.

I agree they made a mistake, but instead of trying to rectify it, you withdrew it, and ran. Your behavior indicates that you know what you're doing is morally wrong. You're just ok with it, because it's in your favor.
Still sounds like stealing.

I sold 6BTC a couple weeks ago, to pay for my GPUs for mining. However, the remainder of coins I've mined, I'm holding onto to see where it goes. At this point, anything that I mine is pure profit. If it hits $0, I'm out nothing.

I work as a security consultant doing penetration testing. When I'm on an internal gig, one thing I'll do fairly early on is look for web applications on the network. Once I find them, i specifically target PHP and classic ASP applications first, since they seem to always be the ones that let me in. I typically pass on ASP.net, JSP, and newer frameworks, unless I just don't find any vulnerable. Usually the ASP/PHP ones let me in, though.

I personally bought 2x ATI AMD 7970s, but for cost effectiveness, I think I'd honestly go with the 7950s now. Lots more Mh/s for less energy. Maybe not quite as powerful (also not quite as expensive), but you can always get 2.
However, with the cost of BitCoin deflating as much as it is, I'm not sure it will remain profitable for me. At $0.12/kwh, it costs me around $50-60/mo to keep them going, and Bitcoin is hitting that rate. We'll see what happens.

It took me like 30 hours to get my Dwolla verified a few weeks ago.

Can we somehow have Bitcoin: Faction Warfare?
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:52:36
Yup, it's not profit until you cash out.

It's super great. If you're interested, check out the hiring thread on sometime.

+1 for the mental image of:
"a personal unicorn that ejaculates sprinkled rainbows"

I'll give it a shot and see if it works, once I am able to withdraw my cash.

Yea, I went to do it several days ago and I was 9080 in queue. They seem to be processing about 1000 per day.
Here's hoping I can pull money out one day.

I just wanted to cash out a couple bitcoins, and I had to verify regardless of the amount. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:47:06
The wife and I had the same feeling, and I needed to pay off the GPU and iPhone that I promised I'd pay using bitcoins I mined. I sold 6 for $102 each on Monday, and now they're $140. Now I feel like crap. But at least I paid off my initial investments.

I have a similar experience with my wife. I tell her the price daily, and when it was going up super high I would get really excited. She eventually told me I needed to only tell her once a day at max. 
Now, everyone at her work knows about bitcoins though, because she told them about my over-excitement. So in a way, I kinda became an evangelist of bitcoins, in a really shitty way.

It's odd, I was discussing BitCoin with some friends at lunch last week, and one of them said, "It sounds a lot like the Eve Market".
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:35:02
Agreed! Also as a resident of Indianapolis, maybe it's time for me to make an appointment for my yearly checkup.

You can still lose on a roller coaster. I lost my first tooth on one, because I couldn't read the "CAUTION: Abrupt Stop" sign at the end and smacked my face into the bar.

I've not really had a hard time making ROI on 2 7970s. It just depends on how long it takes for BFL to actually start shipping more than 9 units.

So if bitcoin goes on the same scale as gold, she's a witch?! she's a witch!
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:36:57
I think it's more of just an OCD thing, of seeing non-zero amounts in my balance.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:59:04
Yeppers. I'm going to continue mining for the time being. I'm hoping to see BitCoin grow over the years.
