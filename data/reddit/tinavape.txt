Dear Waxwing,
Thank you for your comment.
We were never under the impression that our shipping policy stated on our site could be interpreted in another way. With that said, we have updated our policy to clearly state that our site ships only to the US at this time. We would never want anybody to waste their time in the event they need our products to be shipped to other countries. 
Please feel free to contact us if you find any other information on our site that is not 100% clear. We always appreciate it.
All the Best,

Dear Waxwing,
Thank you for your comment. We do have our shipping information on our site. I am including the below link:
As for not answering the question, "special administrative region of china" is Hong Kong. The only other "special administrative region of china" that I am possibly aware of is Macau. So, in the event SpaceNeedle420 was referring to Macau, you will be able to find on the link above on our website, we do not ship to Macau.
Please let me know if there is anything left unaswered.
All the Best,

Sorry to not have that on our list. Thanks for putting it on your map however. If you like Unicorn's Milk, perhaps in the future try Padm3's Nectar by The Force... Strawberry Shortcake... Very good.

Hello and thanks for your comment. 
Unfortunately, we do not ship to HK or China. The only option would be to have the package shipped to a US address and from there, have somebody ship it to you. Please feel free to contact us in the event you do choose to go this route. 
All the Best to you and enjoy HK, great food :)
