I assume whoever bought the fake gold weren’t scammed and knew it was just a toy. But why buy a fake gold?

Awwhh...I miss this issue of Tintin. I had it when I was a kid. I really liked the cover, and I still do.

Not secure enough. The handle should be all metal so that if you get the wrong socket, you get electrocuted.

Well, if the only advice that you are capable of offering is just “no one knows where the bottom is” that EVERYONE knows, I suggest you stop pretending like you have invested anything at all.

I asked for a genuine tip but instead got trolled with replies from a 10 year old. Yeah maybe I’m a jerk for being a jerk towards a 10 year old troll.

No one asked you for an Investing 101, genius.

Any tips on identifying a dip?
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:31:44
Obviously, there’s no magical formula. That’s why I called it a “tip”. I just genuinely wanted to know how people strategise. 
Stating something so obvious as “a dip is a dip” and that “no one knows where the bottom is” doesn’t actually reflect the maturity of someone who’s 41.

Before that, at the very minimum, better learn how to format the letter properly.

No shit. Obviously looking for tips on identifying when a dip stops dipping.

Haha I don’t even know what I’m supposed to prove wrong. Way to jump into this fiasco without even reading a damn thing buddy ;)
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:21:11
Thank you.

Wow you sure know how to read ;)
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:41:08
Very mature indeed
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:35:13
Those were exactly what the person implied if you knew how to read.
