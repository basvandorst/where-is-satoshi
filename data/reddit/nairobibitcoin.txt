Why would a black woman have to worry about inflation when her net worth is $5 dollars?

Banks are obsolete institutions from the 17th century whose main purpose is to get people hooked on usury. Seriously who gives a shit about the products you outlined? Oh no, not no loans.
You can get a bitcoin wallet in 30 seconds and start recieving/sending. No applications, no approvals, no government tax documents. You seriously still trust banks after what went on in 08-09?

Thats bullshit. Loans for consumption are impossible to repay as no new investment is made to produce income for interest repayment. This is why we are in an economic crisis because the world is awash in credit that cannot be liquidated without a default. A 30 year mortgage you end up paying 2-3 houses off even though they were never created...
US home ownership has plunged as a result.

So you just realized paying miners $2million per day for doing nothing is stupid?

Yea and government will fix it with by passing a bill.

Looting and destroying companies for personal profit, while being angry that the government attempts to steal from you. You are correct, this is exactly the behavior this sub would condone.

You are right, they don't need to be in bitcoin. However, bitcoin is voluntary unlike most of the state institutions including banks. How many employers pay in cash almost nobody. The state essentially forces you to keep the insolvent banking system propped up, as well as accept its defaulted on promissary notes as payment for your labor.
If bitcoin remains used by even a niche portion of the population that is good enough.

People have been using the word bubble around bitcoin since 2009. If every single participant thinks its a bubble then it isn't one.
