also what's OPs twitter??
@_date: 2019-11-27 00:12:41
looks active, i see its withdrawn, so someone has control of it, there are funds sitting in it currently also so its not autowithdrawing...
@_date: 2019-10-20 20:13:06

can anyone find original tweet? i cant find it :/

technically yes, she could buy bitcoin before it arrives on cashapp for example and it just sits there until her device is setup. let her buy if she wants to :p  
just make sure its a legit device factory sealed from the manufacture, its shouldnt contain any seed word. most devices you create them on first use.  
Peace, love &amp; HODL   
&amp;  
you're  on my daily r/bitcoin top 10 videos :D
@_date: 2019-02-26 00:52:57
Awesome! Congrats on being in crypto now! Your post was also in my daily video today ;) I do top 10 r/bitcoin daily. And about CashApp I've noticed its better fees than coinbase, even when you look at buying $100 for example you can clearly see you will get more BTC from CashApp. Anyway hope to see ya around in the crypto sphere in a few years! :D

look for a coinstar that pays out BTC, or BTM(Bitcoin ATM) or... try to find someone locally that would exchange for you like a friend or a friend of a friend.  
Edit: this comment was done during my video: [
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:21:59
i did also  
edit: as in i also got the same msg from the same user, a lot of people did.  
also... he says "**Just my 2 cents"** when it should be: **"just my 2 SATOSHI"!!**
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:53:14
I didn't say whole story. I said new.
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:09:45

@_date: 2018-12-08 01:20:39
