According to [this]( they will support withdrawals but not deposits.
Also, you would need to do additional verification steps in order to enable withdrawals.

Makes sense. Thanks for your insight!

I don't how about that but why oh why would they use *only* Coinbase and suffer from all of their problems too?

Oh come on. Robinhood has millions of users already and all stock brokerages ask for SSN.
Robinhood has established an awesome reputation.

They already lost me right after the Bitcoin cash drama.

Already transferred a chunk of my coins to my ledger nano. Waiting on coinbase to bump up my limit so I can do the rest. I am also going to be using Gemini in the light of how coinbase screwed up things while listing Bitcoin cash.

How are you HODLing up after that?

NVDA can easily do $300 in the next year, they are very well placed and of course the whole crypto space is only helping their GPU sales :)

Everything you said, applies to me except that I am not a millionaire yet.
Live and learn! Bitcoin enables the kind of freedom that was never possible before especially for people who live in underprivileged places or are otherwise constrained by their environment.

Thanks for trying and chasing it down. You are awesome!

I didn't even try on testnet, went straight to mainnet for my setup. YOLO :D
What is the exact issue your are having. I ran into one issue and resolved it using help from  IRC channel on Freenode

I am amazed at the negativity. The whole reason of my excitement is that now I can begin to experiment with the tech and in the process learn it. I write code and have been meaning to get up to speed with Bitcoin and lightning.
Instead of wasting time talking about the price and creating/commenting on memes, I am instead developing a skill.
Everyone can be a keyboard warrior but very few people can actually learn stuff and then do productive useful things with it.

PM'ed. Fingers crossed for my first invoice! thanks!

I have an account with them and will close it first thing tomorrow

This has the lnd Dockerfile and the lnd.conf file I used (with some anonymization of course)
Currently, I run bitcoind within a docker container as well so lnd.conf file essentially points to the bitcoind docker.

Lol. Someone didn't get the joke.

Yo. The first step is to have an ice breaker. This is it.
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:30:03
Not really. I like to talk face to face instead of being a keyboard warrior. This post is just to show that I have transitioned from reading and understanding Bitcoin to be proactive about telling others about it. Admittedly, the shirt came later since I have been telling people about it for a few months now.
