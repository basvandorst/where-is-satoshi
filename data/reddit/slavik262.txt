I misread this as _liquor_ assets.

My, that's presumptuous of you.


Well then.
Thanks for reminding me that people on the internet like you are such quick-tempered idiots that you think I should die a painful death over a flippant comment that I didn't really mean. You know literally nothing about me besides the two sentences above, made mostly in jest. Fuck you, sir, and all of _your_ kind.

...because someone is resourceful and writes software to solve their problems? This is why we have a lot of nice things, actually.

Thanks for the hard work!

Fun fact: The FBI doesn't use 9mm because some agents in the 1980s got their [asses handed to them in a shootout](
) by a former Army Ranger.  Instead of accepting that the disaster was a result of the bad decision making, lack of training, lack of marksmanship skills, and cowboy attitude on the part of the FBI agents, and despite the fact that the Ranger was shot multiple times with different calibers that all failed to stop him, they decided it was the 9mm's fault. This led to the rise of 10mm, then .40 S&amp;W.

While I tentatively agree, I'm not quite sure what that has to do with the 1986 shootout. And modern JHP 9mm _is not_ a "less functional" tool than .40 or 10mm. That's the whole point of the story - there's nothing wrong with 9mm; it was just the scapegoat.

Aww man, when did their lifetime license become a one-year license? Half of the reason I always recommended it to people (besides it working great) was that you paid $25 once, forever.

You can usually build an equivalent system yourself for much cheaper. And building a PC is pretty much as simple as plugging things in and screwing the motherboard into the case. The hardest part is probably installing the cooler for the CPU, but even that [isn't hard](

So, as someone who hasn't bought or sold Bitcoin for fiat in a a couple of years, who should I be using? And if I still have a Coinbase account wired up to my bank, might they still be the fastest option?

10mm has _objectively_ higher recoil and expense and lower capacity than 9mm. Go troll someone else.

not sure if troll or just raging idiot who makes us all look bad

I don't have enough to warrant using either. I just thought I'd share the announcement.
@_date: 2014-10-04 05:53:00
What if I told you raw stopping power isn't the only variable in the equation?
I'm not denying that a 10mm in the right place will probably do more damage. But I'll stick with 9mm because:
- It does just fine
- Cheaper bullets mean I can practice a lot more.
- Lower recoil makes accurate follow-up shots easier.
Shot placement &gt; caliber. The caliber arguments get really old really fast. Shoot what you want and move on.

There are many, many, legitimate criticisms of Java, but it does the whole cross-platform bit pretty damn well.

Dumb question (I've only ever run the Qt client): Is this just bitcoind? It runs silently when I try it out - is there some verbosity flag you can set?
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:46:03
Could you elaborate on that one? I don't really follow Wiki(?:p|m)edia politics.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:03:22
Overwriting things isn't the issue - I just built it from source and I'm running it from the build directory. I was just asking what options you set to display that info (bitcoind currently doesn't print anything when I run it), and `-debug` doesn't seem to do anything either.
EDIT: `-debug` writes to ~/.bitcoin/debug.log, but how do I get it to just display info on stdout? Or are you just `tail -f`ing the logfile?
EDIT EDIT: `-debug -printtoconsole`. My bad.

I do, and that's not Hillary's main point. For more context:


This begs two questions:
1. How is losing loved ones or being displaced from your home somehow worse than actually having to fight, kill, be killed (or grievously wounded), and watch your best friends die next to you?
2. Back up. Why the hell are claims being made over who has it worse? War is a shitshow for everyone involved. This is a stupid argument.
tl;dr: War sucks. Arguing over who it sucks the most for is dumb.

Don't forget that "women have always been the primary victims of war".
