Edit -&gt; 
It seems the lawyer found in the imprint is not his real lawyer. its a standard imprint used on many websites published by the mentioned lawyer. 
&lt;- Edit
I think Simon has to put a statement for good. Everybody is speculating and rumors going around like there is no tomorrow. This leeds to this: 
Someone  irc-channel called the lawler mentioned in the (now offline) imprint on bitcoin-24.com and got following responce:
"They can't say a lot, but THIS lawfirm that is mentioned on the imprint has not been doing anything this weekend, since their lawyer for "Polish Affairs' is on holiday &gt;
nobody called their yet about bitcoin-24, we were the first to call
Frau Olga XXXXXX will get back to us tomorrow, she is the laywer for "Polish affairs" in this lawfirm, she was on holidays, so what simon says "his laywers are busy with it" is not true, or it is another lawfirm... but not the one on his imprint"
No news at all, as he maybe went to another lawler recently but as said, no informations leed to speculations...

How could you say "all funds are save" on the website when authorities trying to freeze all your accounts and starting an investigation? Seems not too save for me.

As long you don't reset the balance ...

Ok, that makes sense. But you see that he has to make a clear statement asap or the speculations will continue to create a decent panic.
