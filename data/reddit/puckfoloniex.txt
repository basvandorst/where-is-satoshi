So what? should we say everything is going to be fine without being able to come up with an explanation why it will be fine? I am not saying it will never be useful, I am just saying it is not that useful as a currency now, so there is no widespread adoption. There is absolutely no reason to buy bitcoin to buy something else right now even if we ignore that 15% price fluctuations daily.

Of course bitcoin being more volatile than a national currency is perfectly understandable.

Yes only past data can be used in forecasting, that assumes there should be a way to forecast future prices, when indeed there is not. Just because its the only way doesn't mean it works. You can only use past data to predict the future if the autoregression has any statistical significance. In some cases there are, there is a correlation between yesterdays temperature and todays temperature, so it can be used as a variable to forecast. Thats simply not the case for financial markets. Returns are not significantly correlated.

 Your comparison is just stupid. Forecasting price has absolutely nothing to do with assesing clients into risk groups. Also when you try to forecast the price in financial markets you are actually changing the outcome, unlike for example trying predict the weather.

My criticism for bitcoin wasn't that bitcoin could be end up like fax machines, that was towards your meaningless comparison. I am not saying it will be obsolete, I am just saying just because email ended up being successful despite criticism doesn't mean bitcoin also will.


It has a use case, not as a currency. And without having a usecase as a currency it will not achieve widespread adoption.


If there are currencies that can lose %20 of their value overnight commonly, you shouldn't be going into holidays with loads of that currency in your pockets. When was the last time you used zimbabwe dollars or whatever for an online payment or hotel booking?


It has  absolutely nothing to do with forex market. the reason you need to convert your money to their local currency is you usually earn your money in your local currency and you would preferably want to spend it in the local currency of your destination. You don't even have to do it, your bank will automaticly convert your credit card payments. Bitcoin is not a local currency anwhere and most places do not accept it. Bitcoin is also certainly more difficult to buy or sell compared to common currencies, which you can do at airport as a worst case scenario.

You don't want to buy a significant amount of bitcoin with you to your travels, since it can just lose 20% of its value overnight. And you still need to use a bank account to buy or sell that bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:32:02
If bitcoin the only currency being deflatinary wouldn't be a huge problem maybe. The thing is there is an alternative to spending bitcoin, fiat. Why would I not spend an inflationary currency instead of a deflationary one? Do you have any studies that account for multiple currencies to choose from?

Sigh this sub is really stupid. No its not that simple.
Controlled inflation is not bad, its intended for the health of the economy and you are compansated with raises/interest rates so that your purchasing power does not decrease due inflation. Apparently bitcoin doesn't need inflation to lose more than half of its value in 5 months, so it doesn't matter whether its infiationary or deflationary. There is no hyperinflation in Turkey, and there is no reason to think there will be, so its irrelevant. 
In Turkey's case, there is absolutely no reason for them to store their wealth in bitcoin instead of a USD deposit account (which yields around 3-4% if you are a mid/high net worth customer, higher than USD inflation).  Unless government do something really stupid and start confiscating USD deposit accounts, which is exteremely unlikely.
@_date: 2018-05-29 22:27:01

You are just spewing a bunch of bullshit now 


You just red that somewhere and now parroting it, it has absolutely nothing to do with my objection. This is just populist irrelavant bullshit.


I have been using banks regualarly for like 15 years and there was that one time they rejected my transaction because it seemed fishy, I told them its ok and that was it. I am not saying bitcoin has no use cases, there might be some transactions where you don't want to use a bank and bitcoin might be useful for that. But a bank will never ever prevent you from purchasing groceries. There is absolutely no reason to use bitcoin for your everyday purchases, and some once in a few years questionable purchases won't make bitcoin mass adopted. And you seem like missing the fact that bitcoin is perfectly tracable. If they want you to prevent spending your bitcoin, they can, unless you go batshit crazy and do all your transactions face to face, in which case cash is still a superior choice. You keep spewing meaningless words such as slavery but they are laughable at best.

Oh but its useful to me, I use it frequently with relatively large transactions that would give me a mild headache if I were using a bank account to do that. But thats not a case for widespread adoption. There is absolutely no reason to use bitcoin to pay for goods over dollars right now because a) price is too volatile b) you need to buy bitcoin first to pay for something else, which is too much work for no real benefit.
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:09:58
Confirmation from where? Exchanges ask for 2 confirmations but sending bitcoin to exchanges is not exactly a usecase. I don't think any business would ask for multiple confirmations, even 0 confirmations its exteremely unlikely that transaction wouldn't go through, if sent with an average fee. If you are doing peer to peer transactions 1 confirmation is more than enough.

If you are a high/mid net worth individual you don't just open a deposit account with quoted rates. You can negotiate for higher rates. 250k+ USD will get you around 3%, you can easily negotiate 4% for 1 mil+. Garanti is the largest bank in Turkey, larger the bank is lesser the room for negotiations USUALLY. You clearly don't know what the fuck you are talking about, I had an USD deposit account in Turkey which yielded more than 2%, until recently.
Erdogan has been saying that for years, almost every time TRY starts to lose value against USD, its not a meaningful risk compared to macroeconomic and political risks Turkey faces. You don't seem to understand the fact that bitcoin lost more than half of its value since december. So much for a store of value right?

I don't live in US, and please do explain mr edgelord, why it is important to not have a third party for your every day transactions. 
Also bitcoin payments DO use a 3rd party to facilitate transactions. You don't have to use it but everybody does because its a nightmare to deal with bitcoin.

I cannot express how stupid this idea is.
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:35:19
No its not, its a retarded narrative from clueless monkeys who patheticly need bitcoin to rally so that they can quit their shitty day jobs. And you are just changing the goalpost, bitcoin is a terrible store of value because it has a huge downside risk and downside risk is what matters for a store of value asset. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:09:59

Except absolutely nothing worthy is priced in btc.
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:48:09
You don't buy bitcoin to use in Russia, its so volatile there is a very strong chance that you will lose 10-20% of your money overnight to volatility. Fees and other frictions are negligable compared to volatility of bitcoin.

You are just mad people are making a lot of money shorting, while you are holding lol.

lol what
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:24:42
It really isn't useful as you still need centralized and regulated exchanges to buy and sell bitcoin, its just an extra hurdle for no real benefit in most cases.

Fair enough, I very rarely deal with Euro. 


I am not talking about smuggling cash, I am saying you can legally carry more than 10k, you are using circular reasoning. 


I didn't say I went through customs with more than 10k, I just said noone checked my wallet and I could easily move more than 10k. And I don't to tax fraud, why do you keep assuming my money is illegal lol it doesn't make any sense.

If you try hard enough you can conclude that we will never be in a bear market because price was less than 1$ at some point in time. But that would be ridiculous and people would laugh at you. Just like we are doing right now.

Yeah everything is a conspiracy. Its impossible that people just don't want to buy bitcoin.

Its not a popular belief, its just this sub being retarded.

Lol at this being bullish.
@_date: 2018-06-19 11:06:29
Sigh you are so clueless I could only last a couple sentences before getting overwhelmed by cringe. 


That applies to stocks or bonds which generate cash flows independent of what market thinks. This does not apply to commodities or cryptocurrency and thats why investors like warren buffet do not invest in gold. Bitcoin can be massively adopted and be perfectly useful with a 2k price tag because if its actually used it will be converted to fiat by merchant who accepted crypto payment, immediately. You don't even understand investment basics, please don't share your opinions.
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:52:49
They can't shut it down but they can outlaw it which would destroy the adoption in US and render it harmless (assuming its a threat, which is wrong). 
@_date: 2018-06-17 00:49:10
It doesn't matter, if price falls less efficient miners will stop mining, hash power will decline and it will be cheaper to mine.
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:09:09
Yeah yeah, we are going to beat the banks, buffet knows nothing, this is the 5th industrial revolution, we know.

No he is comparing a commodity with uninvested currency, you are also a moron.
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:02:42
And it lost more than 50% of its value in last 6 months, why do you think your time period is more relevant? Why the fuck would you assume it will always grow annualy? Shit you people are fucking retarded.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:37:37
Yeah just like it was on sale at 15k. Fuck off.
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:03:21

Why would they spend any money for a 51% attack when they can just outlaw it for virtually free?
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:19:44
Whatever supports your narrative right?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:19:04
Thats not priced in bitcoin. You can use bitcoin to pay but the USD value fluctuates.
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:34:43
You failed to explain how removing the use case of bitcoin would increase its price. Its already used in dark net (actually its not, monero is the popular choice there) so its priced in, if they outlaw it only thing thats going to happen is merchant won't be accepting it people won't be able to buy or sell it with ease.


No it didn't price crashed like 40%, than people realized it was just fud. Price increased because people realized it was lies, price didn't increase because china banned bitcoin. If the news weren't a lie it wouldn't recover.


I wasn't complaining about the fee, I was complaining about them not using that fee, sending bitcoin with 1/sat byte and making it stuck in limbo for a day when mempool is empty, I don't know which one is more pathetic, you going through my post history or failing the understand a very simple point.


I am currently 60% btc and 5% strat, thank you for your educated response. Not that it has anything to do with bitcoins use case. Once again you are patheticly trying to find an attack surface.
@_date: 2018-06-20 11:44:07
Did you really compared returns of cash and gold? What would happen if you actually invested that 20$ in stock market? Fucking moron.
@_date: 2018-06-21 21:56:38
Oh i will, keep circlejerking with your retarded narrative.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:16:30
Except literally nothing relevant is priced in BTC so this is a retarded arguement.
@_date: 2018-06-21 21:31:25
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:10:30
Lol do you really believe that stupid bullcrap? Its just bubble deflating slowly.
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:48:41
Well because when a company does and IPO, stock price is never 0 but at some point in time bitcoin was mined and traded for virtually free. Lets say someone bought 3 million btc at 1$, but when you are calculating market cap you are also multiplying those 3 million btc with current price, so its much more misleading than market cap of a stock.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:40:20
Miners expanses are prepaid (new tech, electricity) hash rate does not react to price this quickly.
@_date: 2018-06-03 04:08:04
It baffles how people come up with this arguement, I mean are you really this stupid?
Outlawing cocaine makes it harder to find but not harder to use, it still inhibits reuptake of your serotonin. It limits supply but not the demand, thus price increases.
Outlawing bitcoin makes it harder to buy AND use, as no merchant could accept it legally. Now you have a currency in your hand that cannot be used except face to face illegal transactions (in which case cash is still superior). And are you suggesting removing the use case of bitcoin would result in a surge in price? Are you fucking stupid? Do you remember what happened to price when there was a rumor last year about bitcoin getting banned in China? Did it get more expensive?
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:48:50
You are being stupid now, you CAN pay with bitcoin but if bitcoin depreciates in value you need to pay more. You don't pay a fixed amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-02 18:55:18
I know you are completely clueless on this subject but if you want to store your value, downside risk is infinitely more important than your upside risk. Your welcome.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:09:45
Except everybody knows bitcoin and they are not buying it because there is no reason to do so. Your fantasy is retarded.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:09:45

@_date: 2018-06-18 11:14:24
Why would mining become "too" expensive? If bitcoin price is too low for mining to be profitable hash rate and difficulty will drop. 
After all bitcoins are mined there will still be fees to incentivize mining.

1000$ is more than enough, the thing is, cryptocurrencies are exteremely risky compared to stock markets (or even venture capitals). They are unregulated, manipulated and we are looking at the barrel of a regulation shotgun. There is a non negligable chance that you will lose most of your money in a very short amount of time. (less likely if you invest into something solid like bitcoin or ethereum but still.)
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:23:26
We are down 60% from ath what the fuck are you talking about lol.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:18:18
Thats a terrible analogy lol, you can buy alcohol while its legal and consume it later. You want bitcoin to be legal while buying and consuming later (turning into fiat). Noone is gonna buy bitcoin if there is no guarantee for easy fiat conversion.
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:51:47
Satoshi  disappeared to prevent that right? Its peoples money and they should do whatever they want with it without a leader. Zealously sticking to first iteration of bitcoin is idiotic. Modern theory of evolution has nothing to do with Darwins work, its called progress.

@_date: 2018-02-02 15:24:58
I am not saying LN will solve everything,  I don't have the proper backround to reasonably predict how it is going to affect fees and tx speeds either. But it will probably make bitcoin one step closer to be able to properly scale. Without compromising decentralization and security.
 I just lose it when some idiot thinks bitcoin is slow and expensive because the tech is outdated and their shitcoin with a vauge whitepaper and 2 github entries is blockchain v3.0. I love eth, my portfolio is around  40 % eth right now, but it is NOT strictly better than bitcoin. Bitcoin is simply more secure, trusted and resillient. They will coexist together.

Not a good idea to tell your balance in public.
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:38:26
Thats not how it works though, inflation is a very effective tool to "control" spending behaviour of people. If you have ever experienced hyperinflation you would know that people would spend all their money on the payday. People will not save ALL of their money because there is deflation of course, but they will greatly reduce their spending and cause stagnation. Now if bitcoins yearly deflation is 1-2% of course its not a big deal, you can still spend it (altough still not as much as you would spend an inflationary currency) but it doesn't seem reasonable to expect such a low deflation considering the limited supply and historical price behaviour.
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:37:02
Nothing is happening, LN needs a lot of time.
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:00:08

@_date: 2018-03-24 21:12:07
I can't believe people are using this moronic analogy. Crypto has nothing to do with alcohol or drugs, their value does not come from adoption, if you buy a gram of cocaine, you can enjoy it whether it is legal or not. Value of crypto (especially bitcoin) is adoption, you buy bitcoin to sell it or spend it. If they make bitcoin illegal both of these will be very difficult (you will need face to face transactions). When they ban drugs they limit its supply so price go up, when they ban bitcoin they will limit demand MUCH more than they limit its supply because you can't legally invest or spend it.
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:32:41

I have no idea about mining so take my idea with a grain of salt please. 
Afaik miners buy electricity with contract, so their bills are paid in advance. So they need to mine for quite a while even if  the price of bitcoin is cheaper than mining a bitcoin. They can just not sell their mined bitcoins as they do normally which would alleviate a non negligable amount of selling pressure.
If this doesn't work I think developers can go nuclear and change difficulty without waiting for biweekly adjustment.

First of all bitcoin will never replace fiat, its a ridiculous idea imho. Best case is they will coexist and it will be an alternative asset class which is somewhere between gold and currency. Its like gold because its scarce, but way easier to spend and move.
Second, bitcoin is in its baby steps still, its a very new technology with problems waiting be solved (energy consumption, transaction speeds, scaling). Its not difficult to solve any of those, but you have to sacrifice decentralization or security (which is what altcoins are doing).




Not everybody lives in US, good luck finding USD in Africa. And gold is very difficult to move and store.


In this case you are right, there is not much use of bitcoin, but try making an international payment of 50k USD. Its a nightmare. Again bitcoin cannot possibly replace fiat.




Thats not bitcoins problem though, thats an issue with the exchange. Its also time consuming to open a bank account (maybe not in US, I don't know), but after you opened it its easy to use. My typical bitcoin payment takes around 1 minute (and 10 minutes to verify). You don't need to wait for verification for small goods, when someone sends you btc, you can check your wallet and see the funds instantly, if they have sent it with an acceptable fee its close to impossible to reverse the payment. (again you can wait 10~ minutes if you don't want to bother with it). Lightning network is starting to take off and its going to make payments even faster (close to instant).
Again your concerns are not completely baseless, volatility is very problematic, its could never replace fiat for most use cases. Bitcoin will not change the world of finance contrary to common delusion on this sub, its just a new asset class in its infancy.

Rofl are you fucking serious? Ethereum network rolled back because of DAO, good luck rolling back bitcoin. Its impressive how stupid people are, instant and cheap transactions are important, but the technology isnt there yet, your shitcoins can do that because either noone is using them or they are centralized. 
WHOLE POINT OF BITCOIN IS TO HAVE A SECURE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER. Bitcoin survived attacks from all fronts, development, contentious forks, mining, media. Eth attacked once and they rolled back their network. Please tell me how many attacks nano survived. I seriously want to murder my self when someone thinks bitcoin is old tech.

Deflationary trait is negative if you want bitcoin to be a currency. If something is increasing in value over time you are incentivized to hold it instead of spending it, this why, you know, real currencies have inflation. If, however if you want bitcoin to be a way to store, move and control your wealth and for occasional "big" purchase  deflation is good.

Pairing alts with fiat will do nothing about alts crashing with bitcoin.
Alts crash with bitcoin because if bitcoin fails for some reason alts will fail too. Bitcoin is proof of concept, as simple as that. If alts were valuable on their own they would gain value versus bitcoin while keeping their usd value during crashes.

Nope, wallet applications have slow fast and normal choices, you don't need an external website.
 "Oh, so I have to have to learn what the mempool is?"
Not really, I've been using bitcoin for 2 years and only had to check mempool once during the december congestion and that was because I choose cheap option on my trezor which was dumb.

This is survivorship bias. This sub is unbelievable.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:17:14
Umm its completely irrelevant. Stupid people always thing what happened in the past will happen again but it probably won't. There was a reason for that crash, now we are crashing because it was a bubble and people totally lost interest.

Not sure if you are trying to give investment advice or is it an amalgamation of all the stupid shit we heard in reddit for last 4 months.

9 months x minimum monthly wage.
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:39:05
Nope, gambling is more accurate.

@_date: 2018-07-02 18:23:06
So by your logic we will always be in a bull market because price was 0 at a certain point in time.
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:46:28
There is nothing fucked up about that though. Its beneficial to both seller and buyer. What benefit does seller have by selling you at a discount if you are going to buy only 2 btc?
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:00:46
Yeah but it only works because everyone else if buying high and selling low. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:02:56
Why would he accept your bet instead of buying bitcoin?

No there isn't, bitcoin core is the software, blockchain is called bitcoin blockchain. Its like calling bitcoin cash blockchain bitcoin abc blockchain, because thats the software. You are both factually wrong and and stupid, you should stop talking.

Thats wrong though, you can't beat the stock market by beating average people because most investments are done by professionals by volume and you are betting against them. Same for crypto, you are not betting against poor joe with 10k.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:12:31
Heck, its even possible to produce gold in particle accelerators if its expensive enough.

Keep holding those nano/bch bags moron lol.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:16:22

Meanwhile he calls bitcoin bitcoin core lol.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:54:43
Shorting btc is fine if you are one of few people who can actually beat the market consistently. Shorting with leverage on the other hand...
@_date: 2018-07-15 12:13:20
Because his bags are heavy and needs assurance and expect us to tell him how bitcoin is going to replace the current financial system. Pathetic really.

@_date: 2018-04-05 14:50:19
Yeah keep spewing buzzwords. If you don't incentivize players to secure the network and ensure immutability, you will have to do it with trusted nodes, which defeat entire purpose of a blockchain. Blockchains can't work without associated currencies, get your head out of your ass.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:51:25
I don't think bitcoin executives would allow bitcoin stock price to fall like that.

@_date: 2018-04-07 19:55:48
You should be concerned. December was an anomaly, increasing adoption does not mean we will go back to december in near future. If there was nothing to concern, there wouldn't be possible gains. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:24:36
I think you should stop speaking on behalf of smart money.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:40:58
Actually it shows that software engineers are not interested in exchanges. You can check prices to see demand for crypto. (hint: down 70%+ in last 3 months)

9) "Bitcoin's tech is trivial &amp; nowadays obsolete, surpassed by other, most advanced "crypto" projects!"
No: Bitcoin is by far the most advanced, up-to-date, bleeding-edge innovative FOSS/Crypto project out there, w/ likely one of the highest concentrations of brain-power ever.
I've been saying this for a while but people don't seem to get it. They just think bitcoin is slow because its old tech. It would probably take 1 hours to make bitcoin faster than anything but you would have to sacrifice security or centralization which basically every "payment" shitcoin is doing. Smartest people in this field are working on ethereum and bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:45:35
Thats survivorship bias, there are also people who made millions from lottery, doesn't mean its a +ev investment.

@_date: 2018-04-28 16:32:52
You can create and mine more of it. Its depends on price. If the price is high enough you can create gold in particle accelerators.
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:02:12
Nope thats wrong. Not even accounting for opportunity cost. This is a stupid advice.
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:30:02
Bold move.
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:33:01
Only way to cancel a transaction is to send it with a low fee, it will return to him after a certain amount of time. However currently bitcoin network load is so low, even the transactions with minimum fee are mined.
To make sure, just wait until transaction is verified once. It takes 10 minutes on average. After 1 verification it is virtually impossible to reverse to transaction. Your wallet will tell you how many confirmations your transaction has.
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:10:04
There is no such thing as bitcoin core blockchain.

Whatever tries to replace bitcoin has to be open source, if its open source there is no reason for bitcoin to not adopt the new tech.

@_date: 2018-04-05 16:42:42
Well the thing is cryptos arent really worth the effort, noone will bother with it if its not easy to buy or sell.
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:06:20
OTC (over the counter). Never bought bitcoin OTC, but yes directly buying from miners might be logical. Exchanges also can have auction sales for large amounts. That principle applies to stocks too, if you are going to buy large chunk of a company, you wouldn't do that on exchanges because of limited liquidity (ie price would skyrocket if you try to buy half of the circulating shares).
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:04:52
