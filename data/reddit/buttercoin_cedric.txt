We're open to ideas here.  What do you have in mind?  What are others doing that you like?  How can we do better?

Thanks gandrewstone, this feedback is helpful.  We will share as much of this information as we can without compromising Buttercoin's security.  You can expect more information shortly after launch.

Good point nilahiet, we'll post our engine speeds post launch and let the community decide how we stack up.   I've also edited my comments above from "thousands of times faster than existing popular crypto exchanges" to "very fast".  Our speed estimates were based on tests we conducted on MtGox &amp; Bitstamp. At the times of the tests we were much faster, I don't have the precise numbers but our engine was substantially faster.

Good point, BitcoinOdyssey.  To mitigate the risk of having coins on an exchange, how do feel about the following feature?  Giving people the option to automatically send all purchased bitcoins directly to a bitcoin address of thier choosing? We could potentially build a feature like this shortly after launching.  Tell us what you want, we look to the community for feedback to guide our development.

Hi cipher_gnome, the four pillars we focus on to give you the best experience possible are Security, Technology, Liquidity, and Usability. 
Security, we work with external penetration testers quarterly, run ultra secure multi-sig cold storage system, and go to extensive lengths to make sure your funds are always secure. 
Technology, our core trade execution engine is (edited from: "thousands of times faster than existing popular crypto exchanges" to "very fast".  We'll quantify and publish our speeds and make them public after launch) very fast.  
Liquidity, we have $2MM of bitcoin to make our markets liquid and ensure narrow spreads. We also work with external market makers who bring larger amounts of liquidity into the system and narrow the spreads even further.
Usability, we work closely with our investors at Google Ventures and Y Combinator to refine our UX and do regular user testing to make Buttercoin as easy to use as possible.

Hi tebexu, security of your funds is of paramount importance to us.  As such, one of our core values is, "Be as paranoid as possible."
We go to extensive lengths to protect your funds.  This includes, but isn't limited to, quarterly penetration testing with the most intense white hat hackers we can find, ultra secure multi-signer cold storage system, encrypted hard drives, and much more. 
We'll also be preforming regular internal, external, and public audits of our bitcoin holdings.

Hey cryptonaut420, Cedric Dahl here, Buttercoin CEO.  I can appreciate your interest in transparency, especially with what's been happening in the space recently.  
Here's the wallet address we've been receiving donations at: 1McqPj92jvWfFg5F24dwyDSUptjTosH2EY 
And here's a link to the most recent thread where my bearded buddy Bennett (co-founder/CTO) asked the community what we should do with the donations: 
Finally, here's the Blockchain record the wallet address:

We're open to alt coin order books in the long term, in the short term its a question of engineering resources.

burnobus7337, these are all good points.  We're still working out how best to disclose all the things.  The goal is to be as transparent as possible and protect customer information / security. Our transparency practices  will be refined over time and we look to the community for guidance.  Tell us what you want, what you like about what we're currently doing, and what we can do better.  Also, specific examples of what you'd like to see are helpful, for example, what would you like to see from a security audit, can you please share an example of an in-depth analysis that you like?  We'll do our best to accommodate and continue refining based on feedback.
