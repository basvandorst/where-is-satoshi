Can bitcoin do smart contracts? Can anything be built on it...Have you done any research at all?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:00:45
So ethereum then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:42:48
this is why etheruem is superior.

I sent 1400 USD for less than 1 dollar today.

Which one..bitcoin cash..gold...?

7042.46 is the exchange rate they are using when the exchange rate is 5463.93

ANy bitcoin cash atm's? I want a coin that can handle lots of transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:18:29
Maybe I should make a bitcoin atm business. I think there needs to be a legit business in this field.

Whats confusing about I put in 60$ cash and get 60$ value of BTC minus a small fee. How is it normal for an exchange rate to be 7000$ for btc when it's in the low 5000's? My intent was to trade 60$ cash for 60$ btc minus regular atm fee.

44 Million dollars of eth was transferred for less than 14$ I recently read. So how is bitcoin the leader if eth can do it for cheaper and faster?
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:27:58
Guess you didn't read the part where I use another ATm and I get 54$ for my 60$
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:09:46
I have used bitcoin atm's 20+ times. I usualy get 54$ worth of btc for my 60$.

Bittrex deposited the money into my account today :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:16:22
It amazes me that people think it's okay to get 39$ for 60$ worth of money.
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:59:58
ATM said I am depositing 60$ cash and will be charged 6.35 fee. And exchange rate of 7042.46, which I thought was really high but I assumed Bitcoin price just went up again.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:32:27
Gas companies can't charge different prices for this very reason.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:10:30
I guess your okay with putting in 60 and getting 39 back cause thats fair...thats fair. You must rly like getting screwed.
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:49:34
I like it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:16:53
I don't have a BTC calculator on me, I assumed the ATM wasn't scamming me since I have used bitcoin atm's 20+ times.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:25:31
This is...amazing.
