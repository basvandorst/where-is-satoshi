This is a throwaway account. I've held all my net worth in Bitcoin and equity in Bitcoin companies for over 1 year. I do not plan on cashing out of either of those investments for the next 3 or maybe 5 years. That being said I have cashed out at various times to eat/etc, but I have remained 90-95% invested at all times. I probably will remain that way for a long time.
When I do cash out, I would like to cash out into things that will move humanity forward. Also, nice place to live, nicer food, etc but I would not worry about any of that until reaching a much higher net worth.

Glad to help. I really like Coinpunk - in my view Blockchain.info's MyWallet is the best wallet for inexperienced users and relatively secure as well. Problem with this is that if Blockchain.info goes down everyone looses. Coinpunk seems to be the best way to fix this problem by providing a 100% open source version of Blockchain.info which anyone could run on their server. I hope it succeeds.

One of the important parts about investing when you are young is being disciplined and not increasing the amount you spend. Also - make a conscious decision about your risk tolerance. If you have a spouse/children/house then you need to be less risky, but if you are single, in your twenties, etc then you might be able to tolerate a lot of risk.
I try to keep my spending as low as possible and then every month, everything I do not spend I will invest. The last year I have been pouring money into BTC every month. If something terrible happens and the price goes to $0 (I find this highly unlikely) then I will be out of luck, but that would not effect me that much since my spending is so low.
