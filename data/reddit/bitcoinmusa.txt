Can someone explain how you could send to an ip address?

Thousands of dollars won't buy you a house.  Stop gambling, don't bother.  It's simply not worth your time.
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:21:38
Exactly.  It's easy for customer's to avoid the tax; it is not so easy for a company with an office full of employees to avoid it.

I completed a localbitcoins sale back in February and it went very well.
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:58:10
Accusing someone of theft requires proof, not just suspicion.
@_date: 2013-05-15 08:22:39
There is a common confusion however that Bitcoin's code determines its price when in fact the market on 3rd party sites like MtGox determine the price.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:59:30
They might as well use a .onion given that its probably more popular.

WTF, I'm a proponent of Bitcoin but I am **never** relying on people due to my faith in humanity.  I take the risk of trusting my money with exchanges ONLY because I know that a well run exchange with a physical address can make more money processing trades than simply stealing everyone's coins and never receiving a trade again.
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:44:03
I don't agree with everything he says but I appreciate his rationale for all his opinions.
@_date: 2013-03-24 08:30:28
I'm sure the **majority** of large internet businesses will simply ignore the tax and face no repercussions. /s
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:44:57
They are clearly undercharging.  Demand is higher than what they can handle yet they don't raise fees.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:32:00
But what is the alternative, a fundamentally weak thing that is easy to abuse?
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:40:36
Everyone should use Bitfloor.  Their volume is lower but you can sometimes get a bargain either buying or selling because of it.  They have lower fees and I want some competition so MtGox can step up their game.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:03:47
Just sent the small amount for trading I kept in MtGox to Bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:20:14


Yeah... no
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:25:28
All they are doing is enforcing the laws they already enforce.  They were "nice" enough to explain how those laws interact with Bitcoin so everyone is clear.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:11:23
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:52:32
I've experienced this first hand.  I used to tell friends about Bitcoin and they would be skeptical, but play SatoshiDice for 1 minute and everyone wanted to watch.
@_date: 2013-03-07 08:43:41
Officially it isn't any different than allowing users to give other users cars... very small cars that cost $45 each.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:13:58
I remember when people used to post "Reddit Accepts Bitcoin!" and "Wordpress Accepts Bitcoin!"
In the last month all we heard was "Guys the price is really high, how long am I going to be rich for?"

Except for the potential issue of [structuring](

Blogs generally have lower operating costs.  I was generally against pay walls until I started reading the New York Times and realized that a publication that produces well written interesting articles can sometimes demand a higher price that a blog can.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:58:56
The internet is untouchable but it is not unaffected.  Laws will never stop Tor sites hidden on .onion addresses using Bitcoin as payment but mainstream dot com site or websites with a physical presence will find it very hard to avoid the law.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:26:08
Half of me is afraid it will become the Linux of currency, the other half of me thinks this would be the best possible end-game for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-02-19 01:40:20
So do we believe copyright laws should not exist?  If so good on you but if you call Google evil for doing this you have to realize the implications of saying copyright law **should not** be enforced.

Except to sell a ton all at once it would require buying a ton.

Exchanges can and have been hacked.
@_date: 2013-02-13 22:45:27
These companies can make more money running a legit business than stealing one day's worth of money and never being trusted again.
@_date: 2013-02-15 17:21:18
Bitcoin doesn't support their business model of recurring payments and will probably not be accepted.
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:27:59
Doesn't this create a new wealth inequality, because you need people paying to play the game, and **not** making money, because if the company takes 50% of the payments, only some people will be able to get more out than they put in?
@_date: 2013-03-13 16:40:01
Surprised no one pointed this out but DAE think he can't accept the tip because it would be considered a political donation without any information from the tipper attached?
@_date: 2013-03-01 17:08:09
I would be curious how the market would react.
If Bitcoin were made illegal scarcity would increase but difficulty of use would as well.
It would still be used on the Silk Road or between people as it currently is, but we would lose **all** mainstream companies that support it.
Even further, companies that put your USD into BTC would go out of business.  In fact, I would expect a drop in price simply because people would no longer be able to get their local currency onto the exchanges!  If you didn't already have USD in your exchange account the only think you could do would be sell, lowering the price.
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:28:44
Blockchain.info is very safe because it encrypts as decrypts the wallet in your browser, so you pull it from them, unlock it, do your business, and then lock it up and send it back.  Most exchanges do not work like this.
@_date: 2013-02-03 23:36:32
Seems minor and correctable.
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:00:57
Because you base a fair point, "lack of internet taxes put brick and mortar stores at a disadvantage" on something libertarians disagree with in the first place.
What you said is absolutely true but the unfairness comes from the government's involvement and creation of taxes on brick and mortar stores.  Most libertarians see that and already disagree with you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:08:24
A man who can successfully take risks is attractive.  This isn't a fairy tale, and if we can't judge people on their actions what are we supposed to use to judge them?
@_date: 2013-02-15 17:24:44
This is the most unflattering meme.
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:43:44
When a party line is based on principles you find correct, it can lead you to making correct decisions based on the party line.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:49:35
No.  Things can get worse.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:40:29
Now I hate all the Litecoin spam that goes on here, but I do think Litecoin is interesting because of the faster block time, meaning your transactions get confirmed faster.  People say that this makes the blocks less secure (correct?) but is that actually a real world problem or a theoretical one?
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:02:32
And BitcoinStore is a freight train going uphill that needs $850,000 every month to keep it going up the endless mountain.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:02:25
Finally, a website that looks like it was designed by someone who talks to people.
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:35:09
You won't believe it until you actually pay for something with Bitcoin but it is so easy to input all your information, and then instead of logging into your payment processor and confirming and going through multiple pages and redirects, you simply copy/paste the bitcoin address they give you into your client, input the amount, and hit send.
@_date: 2013-02-03 23:35:48
Bitcoin could provide a backstructure for these payments to exist.  If you have a pile of cash there are no preauthorized payments, but if you put that cash in a bank they can pull from your account and pre-authorized payments exist.
Bitcoins are a PUSH system, you send the money, it cannot be pulled from your wallet.
However someone is free to start a Bitcoin credit card, or Bitcoin bank, have you deposit Bitcoins with them, and then have pre-authorized payments with their server/your account with them.
In fact, Coinbase.com plans to offer merchants a subscription button, which would allow them to take Bitcoins from your Coinbase account if you so agreed.

[bitcoin: money without a brand](
This is my first attempt  at making a Bitcoin advert.  I think everyone should give it a shot and release it so we can see people's ideas.
Pros to my Ad: Conveys a message, has meaning, very easy to read, catchy/shareable
Cons: Not very professional/looks grassroots.  Unsure if people view not having a brand as a good connotation, as nearly everything being advertised has a brand.  Still this does create interest as people wonder "what is it if there isn't a company/brand behind it"
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:45:06


Why can't the value increase?
@_date: 2013-02-25 17:04:58
This is an incredibly immature view.  The government considers anything with a market value illegal to use for gambling.  It doesn't matter if you are gambling US dollars, your car, or even if the casino trades your USD for magic beans.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:36:54
If I produce $100 worth of goods but agree to do it for $50 is $50 being stolen from me?
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:20:02
Governments are just going to control businesses that accept Bitcoin.  It gives us more potential power but we have to be careful.

Someone holds the private keys.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:30:14
Then why even bother with Bitcoin.  Honestly Bitcoin has no role in a company that can just operate on both ends.
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:08:51
All you people creep me out with this; I use blockchain.info as my wallet service and I personally choose what to put as a transaction fee on every transaction, and most of the time, I set it to ZERO.
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:02:53
Well Silkroad is able to create addresses for every account, on demand, with no limit, so it would be tricky as you can't recognize a Silkroad controlled Bitcoin address from any other address.
@_date: 2013-02-01 19:14:58
I think advising someone that they would be breaking the law is a decent thing to do, because "As Bitcoin doesn't legally exist to the Feds anyway, they don't need to be involved. ; )" could be interpreted as the Feds saying "Bitcoin doesn't exist, don't bother us with it" when in fact you have to pay capital gains and income tax on it, **according to their laws.**

It would be really annoying for the spy to transfer his Bitcoins into local currency though.

One solution is Bitpay.com
They accept Bitcoins from the buyer and would give you USD.
@_date: 2013-05-15 03:44:53
Both reasons I believe.

How does Gox block the Silk Road?
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:33:58
Lower costs for merchants which means they could offer you either a better product or a lower cost for the same thing.
@_date: 2013-02-26 06:58:59
Yes I seem to have gotten it backwards.
I believe the original bitcoin client should simply be called "The Bitcoin Client"
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:29:26
Because this isn't a stock market, and there are other places to trade.  It just causes a panic to try and sell off at other exchanges before people run out of money.

When you see the [Marlboro Man]( you instantly have connotations to cowboys, the old west, etc.  When you think of Apple you think of minimalist designs and their clean white and glass stores.
What should people think of when they hear Bitcoin?  (And the answer probably is nothing like "cryptocurrency" or "algorithmically generated encrypted money")
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:39:20
The problem will be with chargebacks.  99% of things that can be done with fiat can be reversed at some point in the future after sending.
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:40:06
Because it isn't true.

Bitcoin is the digital equivalent to cash.
It is also peer to peer, so it can be stopped as easily as online piracy has been.
These are the two biggest things that make Bitcoin strong.

If you don't send the Bitcoins over the bitcoin network, there is no way for the receiving party to guarantee that you don't still have the private keys to the addresses on the wallet you gave him.

The official BitTorrent client is called BitTorrent.  The official Torrent client has no name because there is no official torrent client.

@_date: 2013-03-05 11:46:54
They're entire model is recurring payments.  Bitcoin does not currently allow recurring payments but sites like Coinbase are working on it.

Bitfloor had a breach months ago and their fee is .4%.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:23:48
I like Bitfloor but nothing like telling the people attacking you to stop because you don't have the resources to stop them.
