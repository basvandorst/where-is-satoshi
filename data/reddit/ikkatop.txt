I still say
and yes I'm hurting from it too.
We're not a huge way off my very OVER SIMPLIFIED downward slope.
Looking forward to the sudden uptake as people realize it's dirt cheap then buy in droves.

If you want to minimize risk of losing your crypto, then trust in yourself, not others,  and buy a ledger nano S or similar device. Be your own bank.

OMG.. you work?

@_date: 2018-06-19 19:05:42
True, but we where still on the upswing, then the media got involved and Futures was announced and started...so quite unusual.
I try to look at the natural upward growth in price and try to ignore the anomaly of December 2017. So, putting the mad December aside, would the price line on the chart be a fair indication?
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:55:55
Lol LOL LOL I already bought my BTC and Alts... lol
I'm in it long term.. I'm just trying to be realistic, and today is panning out like many days this year before it. Don't be so butt hurt.
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:16:07
Kind of wish 2015 would come around again, but it's a double edged sword as I didn't invest back then and only started in Dec/Jan this year and now sitting at a 50-60&amp; loss my funds are tied up so hmm yeah.. lol.
Moonshot please then we can cash out and go back to 2015 prices for a while :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:07:52
funny you should say that because I posted this the other day... and I guess people don't want to see the possibility of how things appears to be playing out.

You've been around a while, you should be hardened to this nonsense.

How did you make that mistake?  'k' is nowhere near 'c' on the keyboard.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:17:50
We do; but there are groups/organizations/establishments and such that would rather it never took hold as it impacts their way of making money.

I take it "ages" in this context means 7-8 months?
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:43:51
well there's your error.
It's a long game
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:09:12
Who took charge of the Silk Road BTC funds? was it something like 300,000 BTC ?
FBi ? CiA ?  it's one of those, or have they auctioned it all off by now?
USA are in debt ( apparently ), so it wouldn't surprise me if one of those agencies had been ordered to liquidate that 'nerdy play money' by authorities above them.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:39:10

I will be weeping for my unrealized gains ( so far )
and wetting myself with glee as I go on an epic spending frenzy.
I f\*\*ked up 2010 ( HGST Click of Death and no backups ),
I missed 2015, so I'm not missing the boat again.

He couldn't remember how to spell fecally, ( which would have been more accurate )
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:18:09
it's true though, not at a micro day to day / week to week level, but overall from inception to mid December it's been a steady rise ( of course there are up and downs, but you have to smooth those out to make things less complicated. It would be difficult for anyone to argue against the statement that BTC has steadily fallen since Mid Dec 2017 to now, since it's pretty obvious and as the chart statement wording says, "if this BEAR market continues..."  I can see that price at end of this year. 
Do I WANT to see that price? heck no! ( well maybe..buying opportunity again ) but generally no, I'd rather it just kept rising. The trouble is what we want and what we get are very often different things.

@_date: 2018-06-22 22:02:05
What happens when you run out of Fiat to "buy the dips"?
How are they dips on a downward slope?  just ledges surely?
What happens when you have no spare cash left and then BTC drops so dramatically to bargain basement price and since you're all out of fiat you have no cash left to buy it at with ?
Would you commit the carnal sin of using cash that you CAN NOT AFFORD to lose?
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:58:45
lol really?  please stop breathing.  ( it means OVERALL, as in the greater picture, wider view ) jeeeez.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:30:59
Stand together HODL = do not trade = low trade to no trade = stagnant market or market stalls and falls =  price drops.  Lesser hodlers worry and sell, but not enough of them = price continues to fall...... rinse and repeat.
Whales buy up your BTC.
Is there a solution to this conundrum?
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:01:03
Well, if that's the case, I better get a second job and save up for the extra BTC i'll be able to buy.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:10:26
I got some Dorito's and Nachos, are you willing to share those dips?

It's very likely NOT the future. I'd never go as far to call it TA either.
Re-read the statement, do not add anything beyond that which has been stated.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:03:59
Might take a barrage of media led hot air to get the next wave in though;
the last lot are still nursing severely burned fingers.

@_date: 2018-06-22 20:31:57
So you totally missed the large blue writing in the box? or you just didn't read it.
Stick to what it says in the box....forget for a moment REAL WORLD fluctuation, possible actions IN THE FUTURE ( as in, not today or yesterday etc )
I'm slightly amused that so many people go off-piste / off on a tangent, or add additional variables above what has been stated.
The image has a statement and a few very very simple lines.
The image does not account for ANYTHING beyond what has been clearly stated.
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:57:48
Lol  it's not TA  it's very vary basic. I'm not jiggling about with micro-lines of trends and wedges and all that stuff.. it's as stripped back as I can see and plain as day. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:25:13
I will be right there with you rolling in agony. I would really hope it never happens as I'm invested from Dec 2017/Jan2018 like a mass hoard of other people.. I'm holding out though, I didn't  run away, my knuckles are white with the death grip on my crypto :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:31:54
and it's not beyond reason that the banksters could or would crash crypto to 'get rid of the nuisance' so that they could get back to removing the shirts from peoples backs just as they have done for decades.
It's chump change to do so ( for them ) and after all, they just print it when they want more.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:50:04
Would you agree or disagree with the following basic statements?
1. Since inception, the price of BTC ON THE WHOLE has gone up ( until Mid Dec 2017 )
2. Since Mid Dec 2017, the price of BTC ON THE WHOLE has fallen ( see chart )
3. Since point 1+2 above are true ( see chart ), then based **SOLELY** on what it says in the yellow box on the image above, the statement within the yellow box would be true. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:20:41

well funny you say that, I posed a question earlier
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:52:49
Don't worry.. you can "buy the dips" with all that spare .. oh no, wait...  yeah.. bummer.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:23:44
2009  come on, you should know that. :)
BTC came about as a result of the financial 2008 crash, although it had been an idea earlier than that.
I was into Steganography at the time and prior to that, ( some use the word stegnography ), so I was already in crypto-circles at that time , but not BTC, or invested financially in it.
Discovering BTC was a natural progression of my interest and studies of steganograhpy.
Random facts for you :)
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:53:34
You are correct of course, but as you can see, the mean average has been plotted. ( log scale chart )
The graph is based solely on historical data back to 2015 start ( Trading Views earliest charting ) and up to date then projected forward.
It's just something to consider, since we all seem to get caught up in the daily/weekly highs and lows, and it could be a case of "can't see the wood for the trees"
I ( like everyone else here I guess ) hope this never comes about, but the charts are there for all to see.
We have to all hope this bear market is short and the roll-out and adoption increase so that we can see the reversal of what has happened so far this year.
We're all told to HODL.. but surely if we **all** HODL, then there will be little to no trading volume? which in turn just reinforces the bear market.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:41:59
Good points, but they are both outside the remit of the chart image and wording.

Imagine if we were all stuck with flying the Wright Brothers first airplane design?
BTC is revolutionary, a wonder to behold, but just as Wright Bros did not become sole aeronautical moguls of the world, not will BTC be the only form of usable crypto.

Congrats.. you passed!!!
You are one of only a small number who *stuck to* the statement and graph contents.
You avoided the temptation to add data, or a personal opinion beyond that which was stated.
This shows you think logically and take data presented to you at face value.

or lets just start building and using ocean wave powered electricity stations. All that untapped energy!
Between that plus solar plus other flowing water options ( hydro-electric dams etc that already exist )  do we really need to keep burning fossil fuels?
