Do you fuckers want to know what the *real* problem is? 
I mean the much broader, more fundamental, more existential problem than Block sizes or the various blowhard clerics (or even more hilariously, the psuedo-experts talking rote technical investing book and trying to extrapolate  that to the BTC game, as if it remotely corresponds)? 
The problem is that BTC is still mired deep, deep in the realm of extraordinary autism. This isn't normal autism here. It's like, every one of you fuckers should be fitted with a goddamn Graduated Electronic Decelerator backpack and shocked into a state of permanent catatonia.
Here we have a technology so revolutionary it has the potential to literally undermine (((currency))) itself yet there's apparently not a single level-headed, mainstream minded sherpa who can help guide the BTC breakthrough from its current simpering spergfest into something suited for big-boy pants. 
Scammers and grifters and get-rich-quick herds. Losers and aspies and black market turds. It's like watching a monkey being handed the controls of a space shuttle and told to blast off to wherever suits him. 
Ease of use, faggots. 
Ease of use. 
And aggressively expanded merchant footprint, but everyone knows that. Even the spergs... but can anyone point me to a fucking Youtube video that a typical brick mason can watch and totally grasp what this thing is? 
Regrettably, anything qualitative in nature will be completely beyond your typical autist, who is much more concerned with trying to find a deeper meaning infused in random patterns. Until BTC gets a Steve Jobs rather than just another carnival barker, it remains a weird hobby for men who've never had sex.
