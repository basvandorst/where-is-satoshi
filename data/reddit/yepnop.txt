It would be as strong as your password. If your password is reasonably long (e.g. more than 14 characters), mostly random uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, and considering BIP38 is memory-hard so it takes a while for each try, I believe it would be quite safe.

If it was Bitcoin Core, there is no seed you can access. In the case of Bitcoin Core, you need access to the wallet.dat file. You will find the wallet.dat file in the "data directory" of your HD.
It is also possible to get the BTC if you have access to the private key, which it is normally an alphanumeric string starting with the number 5. However, this is unlikely your case unless you got it manually from the Bitcoin Core command line and wrote it down somewhere.

You could wait for all transactions to disappear from the mempool (probably something around two weeks). Or you can create a transaction with a very high fee that spends from 3d8a5498f89be8d8b790b62af9809cd20c05fd3430c99ccbe1fa58eedf1efff0 and compensates for the low fees of your chain of txs.
If you are not an expert and you are not in a rush, waiting may be best.

My full node only accepts new blocks with an additional maximum of 12,5 BTC plus transaction fees. It rejects every other block and so do the rest of full Bitcoin nodes.

The txid 3d8a5498f89be8d8b790b62af9809cd20c05fd3430c99ccbe1fa58eedf1efff0 is paying 115 satoshis/byte, which is OK.
The problem is you are concatenating several txids with much lower fees which are still unconfirmed. 
670045efee0b7eeade3a6186bfdc358d663e3ea063bf8b4d774f131db1aa4016 , unconfirmed, 5 sat/byte, 
which is spent by 0b1716b8d643779a1feae7643da2681c3cf3d410b47e9783505879637109e4ab , unconfirmed, 105 sat/byte, 
which is spent by 64ed744f12416684d28e7dd3a2320635e84a6cc0b21225770421a19f2f1be4de , unconfirmed, 105 sat/byte, 
which is spent by 3d8a5498f89be8d8b790b62af9809cd20c05fd3430c99ccbe1fa58eedf1efff0 , unconfirmed, 115 sat/byte. 
So, the txid with 5 sat/byte is preventing the confirmation of the chain of txs.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:25:24
I cannot be precise here because the right fee will depend on the size of the new transaction created. Just be sure to spend from an unconfirmed UTXO of txid 3d8a5498f89be8d8b790b62af9809cd20c05fd3430c99ccbe1fa58eedf1efff0 .  
Your unconfirmed txs are extremely heavy in size: nearly 5MB each of the previous 3 txs. That is a total of nearly 15 MB of unconfirmed txs with an average of around 150 sat/byte underfunded approx. This means currently 15 * 150 * 1000 = 2,250,000 satoshis underfunded approximately, which is 22,5 mBTC, which is around 380 USD in fees needed for the quick confirmation of all 5 transactions (including the one to be created). 
In essence, don't broadcast txs willy-nilly unless you understand what you are doing. If you hadn't concatenated those transactions it would have been easier getting the confirmations. Don't concatenate unconfirmed txs until you are sure about what you are doing.

P2PKH Bitcoin addresses are generated by performing SHA256 and RIPEMD160, plus additional goodies such as a checksum, on its public key. A compressed public key and an uncompressed public key represent the same point on the ECDSA curve. However, the uncompressed public key is 65 bytes long while the compressed public key is only 33 bytes long.
From a single private key, a single public key is derived. This public key can be represented as compressed or uncompressed. Since RIPMD160(SHA256(uncompressed\_public\_key)) is different to RIPMD160(SHA256(compressed\_public\_key)), the Bitcoin addresses are also different.

Yes, it can be changed. I just suppose 3 days may be a typical situation. Even without internet connectivity, if you find the cheat through the satellite feed, 3 days should be enough. I suppose it won't be difficult to send the punishing transaction via SMS message to a service with internet connection and then checking back again your own transaction from the satellite feed.


Yes. Watchtowers continuously monitor the blockchain in search of fraudulent transactions. If that is the case, they typically broadcast the punishing transaction.


As you may already know, Lightning transactions are not normally "broadcast" as in the Bitcoin P2P protocol. They are sent and received directly by the two parties in a channel. AFAIK broadcasting the messages does not forfeit any control to listeners \(except for losing the privacy of payments\). This is because these messages are still half\-signed so they cannot be enforced on the blockchain.
Many different nodes could act as watchtowers if that is what you want. The user who wants to defend himself against cheats can forward the fully signed punishing transaction to as many watchtowers as he likes.
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:56:25
Yes, it is definitely possible to pay with Lightning between those two parties with NFC or Bluetooth if there is a direct open channel between them. This is true even if there is no internet connection. 
However, it may be somewhat risky if any of those two parties can eventually access the internet and broadcast an old transaction without the other party having enough time to broadcast the corresponding penalty transaction.
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:58:44
The offending user may be able to steal funds from the non\-offending users. The purpose of watchtowers is to automatically detect if someone is trying to claim the wrong funds and immediately notify the user or/and broadcast the penalty transaction that punishes the offender.
One way to make Lightning work with NFC/Bluetooth even without internet connection, may be to download the blockchain from a satellite \(you only need a dish, not internet connection\).
If the offending user broadcast an offending transaction it will be evident on the satellite feed, and the honest user will have around 3 days to go and find an internet connection to broadcast the punishing transactions and get all bitcoins in the channel for himself.

Does the bank have proper GDPR in place? Banks are asking for very sensitive fiscal information and most of the time they don't even have the most basic GDPR procedures in place. For example, it is common for them to request you send the tax info by email, which I believe is a GDPR breach. 
If you let them know about the data breach, they must inform the supervisory authority about the breach within 72 hours. Do they do that? Probably not.
You send the tax papers (ideally directly to the bank premises on an envelope), do they later separate the user identity information from the tax information, or do they anonymize the info, and destroy the tax papers? Probably not. And this is a requirement of GDPR.
Many banks are swift to require very sensitive tax information and make you feel like you are guilty, but in the end, if you dig deep down, they are the ones who do not comply.

As I understand, if you totally want to avoid command-line arguments for bitcoind, you should place the bitcoin.conf file on the default location and appropriately set its datadir key/value pair with your custom data directory. 
On the other hand, if you still want to use a custom location for your bitcoin.conf file, you could  run: 
`bitcoind -conf=&lt;custom_data_dir_where_conf_is_located&gt;`
Finally, on Linux you can use aliases to continuously avoid the typing. This would be something like: 
`alias b="bitcoind -conf=&lt;bitcoin_conf_location&gt;"`
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:06:45
First of all, the correct default location of the bitcoin.conf file is precisely the Bitcoin data directory. On Windows, this is C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin.conf
You can confirm for yourself.
So you should have the blockchain (the blocks, chainstate and database folders) downloaded by default on C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\
To run bitcoind you can do so from the command line. Either type:
`bitcoind -daemon`
To check if bitcoind is running correctly just type this on the command line:
`bitcoin-cli getinfo`

Double spending is usually ignored by miners so double spending 07751cc32bb57fd94faaf7e4355f4f116bf80942f3b1e8b78ac502dde053ec56 with a higher fee would normally not work.
Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) is the recommended solution but you have "wasted" your bullet by doing CPFP with txid f957941a72991e521227dde56311fd8664ab496212185dfb4431a97bed9ebaea with still a too low fee. If your life were on it, the natural solution would be doing CPFP on f957941a72991e521227dde56311fd8664ab496212185dfb4431a97bed9ebaea, but that would be really expensive now because you are trying to confirm two huge concatenated txs (07751cc32bb57fd94faaf7e4355f4f116bf80942f3b1e8b78ac502dde053ec56 and f957941a72991e521227dde56311fd8664ab496212185dfb4431a97bed9ebaea) with a third transaction.
Transactions are usually sort of "forgotten" by the mempool after two weeks. If your txs are not confirmed by then, you can start from scratch with the right fee at that time.

If you don't timestamp the image, the tax man could say that, even though the transaction was registered at that specific time, the owners of those BTC were still the grandparents all time long. Timestamping the image showing the donation from the grandparents to their granddaughter gives some evidence that the granddaughter is in fact the owner of those BTC since she was one year old.
Registering via OpenTimestamps may not be completely binding in legal terms, but it gives reasonable confirmation that the donation was done on the terms specified. It may become useful in certain situations many years later.

Selling 2X and buying BTC at market price is not a good enough strategy to jumpstart BTC mining after the fork. It may end up becoming really expensive, and worst of all, success is not guaranteed.
However, if a few big hodlers (for example, those betting 1000 2X against Roger Ver's 1000 BTC) instead publicly announce in a credible way they will buy BTC full blocks from miners after the fork in a "1 2X:1 BTC" rate, you can be pretty sure the mining in the Bitcoin chain will work pretty much as usual.
**TL;DR:** Don't sell 2X for BTC. It is much better to make credible offers to buy BTC full blocks after the fork at the price of a 2X full block each. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:41:52
Good to know. I suppose there is not an official statement from Bundesfinanzministerium regarding the one year period yet.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:49:38
I don't know if I understand you properly. 
As an analogy, think of BTC miners as the power propelling an extremely big heavy train at full speed on an upwards railtrack. Suddenly, the 2X fork takes place and most of the power immediately goes away making the train reduce the speed dramatically to a near halt. From that moment on, it would become extremely difficult to put the train back in motion.
Making a credible offer to miners to buy full BTC blocks for 2X coins at 1:1 rate (possibly at a premium in USD terms), guarantees that enough miners have the right incentive to stay on the BTC chain. Most importantly, paying the premium should most likely just need to be for a short period of time. Once the 2X fork has happened and miners mine as usual because of the new incentives, the BTC chain will just keep growing at a healthy rate.
You can also make a slightly different analogy with a depleted car battery: just a spark (the premium) jumpstarts the battery which automatically charges itself with the energy of the car in motion. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:40:00
I don't know what would happen with 2X (maybe lawsuits plague those who promote it), but it is evident Bitcoin will be up and running as usual: the best developers, a strong devoted community of users and the new minted blocks could be bought at a premium by those technically adept to taint inputs and avoid replay attacks.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:59:17
Anyone who is willing to trade a handsome amount of 2X for bitcoins after the fork should not just trade them willy-nilly. They should make a generic offer to miners to buy full blocks of Bitcoin (12,5 BTC plus fees.) after the fork in exchange of 2X coins (12,5 2X plus fees). In the worst case, this action provides the incentive that guarantees that Bitcoin will still be mined at a sufficiently good rate after the fork. 
No need to make any special agreement with any miner in particular. The incentive will naturally bring the miners to Bitcoin.

Miners may well start with 90%-10%, but if the price of Bitcoin holds, new miners will naturally emerge to mine. No NYA agreement can stop the natural pursuit of profit by those new mining agents. If Bitcoin Core keeps delivering top quality code, this may probably be the most likely outcome and then we would have two competing chains with no proper replay protection in place. It is a losing proposition for all involved.
Lots of money can be lost/stolen by replay attacks. I am talking here about hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoins by separate individuals who may rightly look into those responsible, especially when most developers have warned against the 2x hard fork in such a short time. Adding two way replay protection covers the back of all involved, including users.

I don't know their exact reasons, but I normally also divide by 2.5 billion approximately when I want to calculate the world debt per capita.
