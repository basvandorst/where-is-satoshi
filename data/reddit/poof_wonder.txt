I am just baffled that a currency could just be made, and why does it have to be mined? It was mean to be "disrespectful" I just think you are sensitive

How the fuck was bitcoin even made 
@_date: 2017-02-01 19:23:51
Because I personally don't get how the fuck bitcoin is a topic to get mad about when asked about how it is created. Maybe like "how the fuck did bitcoin price go down so drastically" but it wasnt a negative topic in the first place. Want to be besties?

So you have never head anyone say, How the fuck?! Like they are not mad, not angry, but just baffled? I am guessing you just have a hard time knowing when someone is angry, happy, surprised, etc.
No disrespect.

I would buy bitcoin through moneygram and I would sell bitcoin through PayPal. I was 17, I never lied about my age, my social was linked, etc. I had one dispute where I had ample proof I sold him bitcoin (reference number, messages, etc.) and they told me it was too risky and that since I was 17 I wasn't even supposed to have an account.
I didn't even lose the dispute, I got access to the excess money in the account when I turned 18 but when I called when I turned 18 they only released the money and told me my account would be banned forever.

I'm permanently banned because I was 17 making 200+ a day trading and it was deemed sketchy. I get it, I get it, they have the right to ban me but to lifetime ban me like dafuq
Edit: Lmao do you guys actually think that's a reasonable reason to put a **lifetime** ban on somebody? My social was linked, my bank account, my debit card, I never lied about my age. That's why I'm frustrated.

What false information did I submit? I never submitted false information! They knew I was 17 darn them, they decided to take action because instead of buying stuff on ebay I was making monies. Please don't assume you know all the info, and I know I broke tos but that was after the fact, I don't actually read those things.
Edit: to add to the story I called them and they said to wait till I was 18 they would give my account back but when I. Turned 18 I called and they escalated up the ladder to this guy who told me that I had a lifetime ban on Paypal

It didn't change I just added the dispute part even shouldn't matter.
And obviously you do a bit if you keep commenting?

Could be used to build apartments and the homeless that will live in them could also work on the building or help in some way or from.
Idk thing the solution to homelessness seems so fuckin simple and fairly cheap idk why it's such a big issue
