I don't think you will have a luck to buy bitcoin with prepaid card, maybe on some [peer to peer cryptocurrency exchanges]( where maybe you can even use Paypal (where you can link your prepaid card and buy with it). But watch out of scams around this. With regular cc it would be easy. Hope you will have luck and find the way!��

In my opinion Bitpay still one of the best payment processors but by the support and use coinbase commerce is really good too. Maybe you it will be helpful this list of [payment processors]( But make your own research for the best processor because every processor offers something unique that you can use and that will suit your startup better.

That will be hard to crack for US residents, I am trading on all those mentioned exchanges but with my EU friends accounts��. So I did not even try to find exchanges which will let me in, because i know that is hard and it shouldn't be. Maybe look at this [cryptocurrency exchange list]( and you will find something. Wish you good luck with this��

As I know there is no safety guarantee, I did generate it about 3 years ago and I still got it and 1 btc is still on it.  I would gave them wallet and that is it but warn them how worthy it is and that they should keep it safe. Because as I know people heard about btc but they don't know its power.

There should be no struggle everything that you need to know is on www, maybe you can try to find all the info that you need on [cryptolinks]( where you will find everything form how to buy btc, which wallets you can use.... And you can buy a fraction of btc no need to buy whole btc. Hope it helps and remember it is not so hard as it looks.��

Trade only top 10 by trading volume on coinmarketcap, these are secured and safe sites usually. Or you can look into the safe and trusted [cryptocurrency exchange list]( and pick some out of top 10 and avoid new and untrusted exchanges so that you don't get easy scammed.

Better hold BTC then sell I think��. Maybe try Coinbase(not the best option in fee opinion) or some of [peer to peer exchanges]( can do that for you. But usually is hard to make it happen with PayPal and be careful that you don't get scammed with such conversion.

One way is localbitcoins, but I would rather hold  BTC then sell it��. Maybe you can find also some more for btc to paypal sites on [cryptolinks]( Hope it helps

The safest way is to put it into hardware wallet, I use ledger s, but this kind of safety has its cost and you will have to buy hardware wallet. Maybe if it helps on [cryptolinks]( you can find all the possible wallets with neutral reviews. But if you consider any other less safer wallet  you can go for brd wallet, exodus, jaxx....��

Can somebody from bitcoin community give feedback or did used this service? I can not find this site review or test on www not even on most trusted crypto source in my opinion [cryptolinks](
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:13:07
That wasn't too smart from your side, since we all know what happen to btc-e and I don't think you will see it again. Honestly you will have to forgot your btc and left out the part with remember. Sorry bro

Try with Gemini or Coinbase and I think you can find here [exchanges to buy bitcoin via ACH]( And try to compare or calculate fees before you buy because there can always came out ''hidden'' fees. ��

If you start like that it would be amazing, I have trezor too, it is the safest option of wallets I think. You can also look here for all [cryptocurrency sites]( wallets and things you need to great start. I wish you good luck and nice start, you are on the good way! ��
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:36:04
Nice to hear that did somebody from Bitcoin community test this wallet, because I can't find any reviews even on the most popular crypto review site [cryptolinks]( Any feedback from community on how this wallet is would be nice.��

I am using BTC ATMs a lot and a lot of my crypto friends are using them daily. When was hype in 2017 a lot of everyday joe used ATMs, that is 100% but I don't know how is now with them.
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:00:04
If you want to feel not tracked, then make more wallets and send btc there and then buy from different wallet��. Make yourself a exodus or jaxx or brd or any other [cryptocurrency wallet]( After you perform an action you can delete your wallet and that is it��

I don't think so because google usually takes Visa or MasterCard debit cards, and those providers don't want to get involved with crypto. Maybe because Bitcoin has a great future. Overall here is the list of [cryptocurrency debit cards]( that take Bitcoin, and I hope that there is one useful for google and you.��
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:40:44
Has somebody form Bitcoin community use this and can give a positive or negative feedback? Because I can't find this site listed among the most trusted on [cryptolinks]( Would be nice to get user experience info.��

Sometimes that happen usually when I have to buy something very fast I do it with my visa at coinbase(not the best fee choice) and there I haven't got problems, but with prepaid cards I doubt that you will be successful. And some banks or cards have blockade to buy crypto. Here is also list of [cryptocurency exchanges]( where you can buy with usd or eur, maybe you will find right one. Buying btc with cc can sometimes be pain in the ass. Hope it helps, good luck and buy big amount��
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:46:21
Thanks I appreciate that,that is feedback that I want.
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:46:59
The smartest way is to hold the Bitcoin in my opinion. But if you want that for real, the best way is go to localbitcoins or any other [peer to peer cryptocurrency exchange]( and there perform this action. But be careful because the most scam happens around PayPal. Hope it helps��
@_date: 2019-01-26 20:02:28
That will be hard, maybe try to find reliable people who can sell you some bitcoin on forums, maybe here on reddit can someone suggest you a person that is reliable. But be aware of scam. Also maybe you will find here [a peer to peer exchange]( that can help you perform transaction without id. Also you can try to find people near you that have btc to sell in every big city you can find someone that can sell you btc I think. Hope you will have a luck and find something good, I would sell you but I am holder����

It was, but now was the opportunity to buy some more

That is great gift, I bought it for my kids, I bought them paper wallet. The paper wallet is the best idea I picked 3rd on this [paper wallet list]( then print it on good photo paper and try to gift it with white ribbon.��
