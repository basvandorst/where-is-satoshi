Personality disorder occurs if someone has a certain set of criteria that significantly disrupt their every day life. See DSM-V for examples.
Saying that someone's beard looks like crap, that I stand behind my opinion, and  arguing with someone bout self-awareness do not fit any set of criteria for personality disorder. I don't take it as an insult I just think it's incredibly silly that you state this opinion when I don't fit any criteria or show any signs of the sort. Just cuz someone says a possibly shitty or offensive thing doesn't mean they need mental help.

Actually that does sound pretty sad.
But seriously it looks like Ur beard doesn't belong to Ur face, like it it's a toupee-beard or something.its strange. Or maybe u dye Ur beard hair?
But congrats for finding BTC and Ur beard to make the positive changes in your life....

Infinite----there's an infinite negative reflection on my life because I believe his face would appear better without that beard? 
And it wasn't an implication, I directly stated it as I did a few other items because these are the things I wish I worked on more when I was younger instead of the other things because it would make my life easier today. The actual implication is that I know these things now and have already taken action but feel there has been lost time. Of course I have to work on myself--everyone needs to work on themselves, including you and yet you are critiquing me in a manner that you don't. 
What does it say about you for going through a post history and pulling a comment where someone is showing self-awareness instead of just acknowledging this is an opinion of mine, like OP did? I didn't tell him his face sucks-- because it doesn't--I just think the beard doesn't go with his face. Maybe it was the makeup for the show with the beard I dunno but everything looks artificial. He can do with that what he wants.
Kevin Durand is a handsome fellow. In Lost, he had some stubble and looked really good. In The Strain, his beard and hair were dyed black and it just didn't look good, at least for me... I see the same with OP except I don't know what he looks like without the beard but the beard doesn't match the face. That's all there was to it

I like beards, just not on your face.
Also must have had a pretty sad life for a beard to make a significant difference.
Sorry I'm full of turkey, wine and spunk. Happy turkeys

Women have to shave their pits and legs. And it is expected of them as well. Men are allowed to have beards. Well trimmed/maintained beards go against the whole natural state thing doesn't it? I have women friends who wanna keep their armpit or leg hair and therefore have to wear long sleeved shirts or pants Bc people complain about the hair. 
And I thought the reason for circumcision was religion and not due to a woman....
I'm not advocating for circumcision I'm just saying it's not because of women.
Edit: add on
I also understand sjw crap and how 3 rd wave feminists say men are the worst. I don't support that behavior at all.
