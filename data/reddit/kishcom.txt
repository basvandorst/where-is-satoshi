When you can't innovate... litigate!

As a Canadian I'd love to partake. 
As a web developer it concerns me the "forget password" page leaks email addresses.
I'm not ready to trust my mining op to it.

There's also this stuff left on:
*

And that there's sketchy stuff that doesn't throw a 404 or render properly like  and 
And the fact that FireFox doesn't like your SSL provider.
And that it's pretty easy to sleuth out what the MySQL table data looks like: 
... the longer I look the worse it gets.

Just tried them out about an hour ago - sent only $30 via Interac Email. Still waiting for my account to be credited... to be fair it does say 1-3 hours.
Interac Email transfers are awesome. I hope this works out (I'm sure it will).
EDIT - Just got it. Took just over an hour. Sweet!

The interface isn't fancy, but I play here fairly regularly... never had an issue with bugs. In fact I've made about 0.75BTC playing there (at one point that was more like 1.20BTC ... heh).

[Well that was a quick assessment]( Never gunna use this exchange.

I think you're being a little too cynical. Clock speeds haven't increased, but work done per clock cycle has (and will continue). Also, there's been plenty of work done over the last few years things getting parallelization working better to take advantage of multiple cores.

My mother got my little sister 2 bitcoins for her birthday. She also sent me a Google+ invite before I had even heard of it. She doesn't even work in a technical field, she works at a college helping students find employment.
My Mom is not your typical Mom.

Really? Who _exactly_ did you ask?
Secondly, there is much more to reporting than "reaching out" to people. You're free to do your own research (shocking concept I know), setting up a mining computer of your own is trivial. Heading to your local PC repair shop and asking them about the safety of these rigs would have been a 1 hour task that would have stopped you from making such a fool of yourself.


Journalists should _never take a side_. This is the whole idea behind "fair and balanced" reporting. You're supposed to report the news, not report favourably on "which side" is nicest to you.

Insightful contribution.

"rammed down their throats" is a little hyperbolic, but I see the point you're making. It's almost like a reflex to a certain kind of idea that doesn't jive with their world view.

Well put. This makes sense to me.


I'm a big open source evangelist. Bitcoin seems like a natural extension of that philosophy into finance/currency. To me it's clear as day. I'm a developer, so I know that code is outside the realm of what most people will want to look at, let alone understand. It basically comes down to me just telling them "trust me, I'm a programmer" ... which in matters of money I can understand they would reject. There has to be a better way. :\
It feels so much like people claiming a car engine is "evil black magic", even though if they took the time to take it apart and see they'd see exactly what it is. How do you get people to take apart that engine... or at very least trust that their mechanic isn't Sauron incarnated?

Enlighten me. All you've done is slung insults with your hate filled troll account. 
What's it like to carry so much hate with you all day? To have to make troll accounts and bother people doing something that doesn't involve you one bit?

What gets me is that he's "Postmedia's  technology editor". Someone want to tell Postmedia they're employing a moron? Seriously, I can't believe how _downright stupid_ this article is.
Everyone who reads it is going to come away dumber. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 04:53:02
I know you're just trolling, and I'm probably wasting my time asking but I'm legitimately curious. Why the hate? Seriously.

I think this is why it bothers me so much, because it's not even hard to do the research, it's not some super secret knowledge. There are dozens and dozens of really accessible (see: no background in finance ... or anything really required) documentaries and things to read about how our currency came to be. I found that kind of stuff fascinating even before bitcoin came about.
What I'm getting out of this whole thread is one thing: people who dismiss bitcoin out of hand aren't great critical thinkers.
