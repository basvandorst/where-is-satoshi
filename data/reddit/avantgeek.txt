Side chains would be merge mined with Bitcoin and thus protected by the hash rate of the main network. I think it was mentioned in the LTB interview that they are talking to the large miners and pools about how to best create incentives to mine side chains.
Coins on side chains would be at risk, ~~e.g. if for some reason the chain borks and you lose the option to transfer back into BTC.~~ See [this answer]( for a quote from Adam.
Edit: strike that, see comment.
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:29:11
Sidechains do not generate coins. The only way to generate a sidechain coin would be to transfer BTC into it.
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:52:10
It could be more, but as far as I understand the rate will be fixed. I.e. the coin cannot appreciate in value vs BTC, lest you would be generating more BTC than exists on the main blockchain.
This is more about developing/testing/using new features on separate chains while still being protected by the Bitcoin network hashpower than it is about price speculation in alt coins.
Of course, sidechain coins could be colored etc to represent something else, giving them value that is more than the BTC it is pegged to.

The live CD will boot the OS from the CD and not change anything on your hard drives, consider it just a test to see which distro you like. You can then install the distro you like best from the live CD. 
It really is just as simple - perhaps even fewer clicks --than installing Windows. Dualboot is as simple as checking that option during install.
I migrated my main machine to Linux to keep my wallet safer, and haven't booted windows in months. (Actually, I havent had to boot my comp at all for months since it is super stable)

[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:31:27 PM] &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;	shaileshg: again, I would not recommend using bitcoind for accounting  
[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:31:34 PM] &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;	implement move in your own database  
[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:31:37 PM] &lt;kjj&gt;	accounts are almost certainly the wrong solution to whatever problem you are trying to solve  
[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:32:07 PM] &lt;Luke-Jr&gt;	kjj: no, he wants accounts  
[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:32:20 PM] &lt;wumpus&gt;	indeed, don't use accounts, the implementation is likely not fit for whatever you're trying to do  
[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:32:31 PM] &lt;kjj&gt;	lots of people want accounts.  almost none of them are right  
[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:32:37 PM] &lt;shaileshg&gt;	Luke-Jr: but I have a basic concern.. if I implement move in my own database.. user can still use his private key to send money elsewhere unless I don't give him his private key  
[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:32:56 PM] &lt;shaileshg&gt;	which I think is what coinbase etc are also doing  
[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:33:01 PM] &lt;kjj&gt;	someone should put a big "Don't use accounts, bad" across the top of that page  
[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:33:05 PM] &lt;wumpus&gt;	ehhhh if you give anyone private keys from your wallet.dat you're in for a lot of pain

[Friday, February 21, 2014] [06:34:04 PM] &lt;shaileshg&gt;	wumpus: think of running a waller service provider.. i m not giving my private keys to anyone..

[Thursday, February 27, 2014] [08:48:50 PM] &lt;sipa&gt;	bitblender: number of keys/addresses only affects startup time  
[Thursday, February 27, 2014] [08:48:52 PM] &lt;michagogo|cloud&gt;	bitblender: Well, what would you be using them for?  
[Thursday, February 27, 2014] [08:49:05 PM] &lt;sipa&gt;	bitblender: for almost all other performance, it's only the number of transactions that counts

[Thursday, February 27, 2014] [08:49:28 PM] &lt;michagogo|cloud&gt;	But do *not* use them to separate user balances or anything of the like  
[Thursday, February 27, 2014] [08:50:04 PM] &lt;bitblender&gt;	alright..  
[Thursday, February 27, 2014] [08:50:13 PM] &lt;michagogo|cloud&gt;	Basically, if you can't deal with the account data being wrong, getting messed up, and/or being lost entirely, don't use them

[Thursday, February 27, 2014] [08:50:34 PM] &lt;bitblender&gt;	why would the account balance become wrong?

[Saturday, March 01, 2014] [04:41:50 AM] &lt;CodeShark&gt;	rasmuzen, blockchain maintains a huge custom database which it updates continuously  
[Saturday, March 01, 2014] [04:42:06 AM] &lt;CodeShark&gt;	these functions are NOT essential to the functioning of a bitcoin node  
[Saturday, March 01, 2014] [04:42:46 AM] &lt;rasmuzen&gt;	CodeShark: absolutely correct, but I'm in the business of providing consumer-facing bitcoin applications  
[Saturday, March 01, 2014] [04:42:51 AM] &lt;gmaxwell&gt;	rasmuzen: we don't current have eqivilent functionality available in bitcoind as its not required for the functionality of the system, it encourages non-scalable designs that can usually be avoided, and it currently would add about 20GBytes storage over what a full node with pruning would take up... though once we have pruning available will probably make such an index available optionally.  
[Saturday, March 01, 2014] [04:43:10 AM] &lt;CodeShark&gt;	although having said that, it wouldn't be so terrible to add an optional switch to allow txout indexing in bitcoind

You are right, the currently agreed safest methods of storage use private keys generated offline (thus I wrote safer, not safest). 
And yes, Linux is generally considered more secure. This is in large part due to the design *nix operating systems, but also because there are fewer desktops running Linux and thus less incentive to develop malware/viruses for that platform. It is not unhackeble though, so all general rules re safety apply. There is still a tradeoff between safety and convenience, that's where you have to make a choice.

I could definitely see both working. A short teaser for the uninitiated, and a longer for the congregation.
Watched it again. Some more first impressions:
I really like where you have one newscaster asking one question, then having it answered a little later by another clip. The back and forth creates a good rythm. If you can keep that up this could be legen-
The start of the first Max Keiser quote is hard to catch, the end is good.
I think the lady stating both 22 mill and 11 mill coins may be cut short mid sentence, as a new user I'd be confused.
You can go even harder on negatives, lest it ends up as pure hype. More on lost coins/hacks (but have a clip confirming the Bitcoin network itself has never been hacked). More SR/drugs attention in the beginning (then the bust and subsequent bounce).
I know there was a guy asking "can I buy a pizza with it?" in a clip not long ago. I chuckled when he got no as an answer. Could be played vs the 10KBTC order and/or other pizza stories.
Some of the clips would be out of order (e.g. the "gold 2.0" VC guy at the end, isn't that from 2012 or something) if you were to do only a chronological story. Perhaps Intro (like now, lots of questions) -&gt; story w dates -&gt; visionary stuff (like now) to spur further attention.
One part of me says a USD/BTC exchange rate along with a date/timeline would be sweet, another part says this would be too much attention to price.

That was interesting. The article is not a sponsored feature, either. Here's the section for those interested. I added some italics to the brimstoney parts:


two measures that would have a significant
and long-lasting effect on the ability of online
criminals to secure their ill-gotten gains: 
 


for trading currencies online; and  
2. Introduce legislation to confiscate
the proceeds of online crime.


As highlighted by the latest initiative of the
United States to arrest some of the suspects
that were involved in Liberty Reserve (a
group indicted for money laundering that ran
a $6 billion worldwide operation out of Costa
Rica), alternative payment mechanisms, such
as *Bitcoin and a host of others, can enable
criminal and terrorist groups to launder
money and fund their operations.
Governments of the world have the ability
right now to ban these payment mechanisms.*


a user must ‘buy’ the ‘internet currency’,
and at the other end the criminals must
turn the currency into real money.
If treasuries and financial institutions
around the world were to block those
transactions and permit only legitimate
currencies to be used on the internet through
regulated payment service providers and
cards (such as Visa, MasterCard and American
Express), then the flow of many billions of
dollars to criminal groups would be stemmed.


introduced, if necessary, additional legislation
to confiscate the proceeds of such online
crime, these funds could be either returned
to those who had been defrauded or
used to fund international projects that
could bring about a more safe and secure
internet environment for all citizens.


United States could be convinced to take a
lead on these initiatives, that would be a huge
contribution to making the internet a safe
place for financial transactions. *At the same
time, it would also strike a blow against those
who would try to destroy the fabric of our the
world’s well-being.*


Protection Alliance stands ready to work
with governments interested in taking these
hugely cost-effective and sensible measures

I was expecting a sloppy back-to-back of clips posted here the last week, but this is amazing. It tells a story, showing how the reporting goes from amused and quirky to intrigued and almost regular. 
This could become a perfect introduction video--if that is what you are aiming for--if kept somewhat short, to keep the attention of new viewers. Though if you are going for a more completionist thing here, I'll be the first to watch a two hour clipshow during the holidays.
Some thoughts:
Since you are cross-cutting segments, a (ca.) timeline at the bottom might work better than the exact dates of each clip. Not sure what is harder to do.
