I'm watching on Schwab.com - no client trading yet, but I see quotes and volume.

I think it will take a while for futures participants to feel comfortable. There aren't even any market makers approved for XBT yet - takes 10 days from the application to be approved.

Does gold really merit an A on scarcity? There's a helluvalotta gold just waiting for us in the asteroid belt. Enough to flood the world's supply many times over.

So, launder the BTC with more layering? How will that do anything but raise more red flags to an AML investigator?
As an AML investigator, I will have access to the entire blockchain - no need for pesky and time consuming subpeonas and warrants. If the account application lists the source of funds as "salary from my employer", then I can look for BTC flowing into the address from that employer's account. If I don't see that, I can ask why not. 
This already happens today with analog currency deposits, but with much, much less efficiency.  *Know your customer* rules all-of-a-sudden become frictionless once you can expose the entire blockchain to analytics. 
The alternative, of course, is to keep the BTC out of a regulated institution. But that will restrict the pool of potential counterparties where those funds will be accepted. Anyone who wants to play in the "sunshine" economy will have to maintain their trust score or else will face sanctions.

In the game of Go, you can establish an invulnerable position once the stones are positioned so they sufficiently enclose two or more open spaces. These stones and all the stones connected to them have "life". Unable to capture these stones, the opponent must find other areas of the board to contest while the "life" stones become a safe foothold from which to extend. 
Bitcoin has attained the status of "life". It has an unassailable position that the centralized governments will never be able to dislodge. The question now is whether Bitcoin can extend it's advantage. What will a world look like with Bitcoin as the dominant form of value exchange?

Yes. And they can also disrupt communications among miners.
