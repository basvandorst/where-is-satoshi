Yeah i figured something like that.. i ended up claimimg my BTC, let's see if it goes anywhere ;)  they also required some data about my address etc that i had registered with mtgox and it's been so long and I've moved several times since then, that I can't even be sure they'll validate my claim. Shrug. I'm just considering it a raffle at this point, but yeah, sure would be nice to at least get my money back.

:(  wish i still had my 2 bitcoins that were on mtgox

Doesn't it take about an hour or more to have a bitcoin transaction confirmed?

I congratulate the author on his use of two instances of the word 'hacker' with different meanings in the first sentence of the article.

Haha, no ignore the downvoters.  There's nothing wrong with your approach, I think you've started a cool project.  Just that not everyone uses Windows, and this _is_ something that could be developed as a web interface.  Perhaps you could use something like wxWidgets or Qt in the meantime instead of using a Windows-centric GUI toolkit, to make later porting easier.  If you make it Windows-only, don't be surprised if someone makes their own version and copies lots of your ideas for Mac or Linux, but if you intend to support those platforms I'd suggest looking into Qt.
I can see why a local app would be nice, and it would certainly feel snappy, but here are some advantages I think you'd have by going with HTML/JavaScript:
* Local client data processing is still possible.
* Graphing using SVG or Canvas is nice.
* Cross-platform.
* Your application needs to be connected to the web anyways.
* Easier to monetize.
Anyways, keep going.  I can see that you've already done significant work that would have to be redone if you switched, so at this point it is more the ideas than the implementation that matters anyways.  Every good app gets a second rewrite eventually :)
If you _do_ plan to make it open source (yay!), then you could ignore the above point about monetization, but on the other hand setting up a web version on your own server might be even more important for you to make a few BTC before someone else takes an interest.  Of course, making it an online service means adding some more things to worry about too, like user logins, so you might not want to go this route immediately.

Windows-only then?  Why not go with an HTML-based interface?

Excellent, happy coding!

Certainly something critical that I never thought about.  It's true that the market is extremely young and I find that people on the forums seem to forget that very easily.  If you try and figure out long-term trends you quickly realize that realistically the data only goes back a few _months_.. meanwhile in real markets people try to make predictions over periods of _years_, which is impossible here.  So drawing conclusions from short-term drops like this is a little premature.

Right, sorry. Customs.

First drugs, now gambling.. exactly what bitcoin needed to get accepted as a legit currency by the world at large!
@_date: 2011-10-15 15:53:36
How do you calculate volatility? Is it just standard deviation from the trend?
@_date: 2011-07-27 13:18:07
Easier to explain a business arrangement, even if it's sketchy-sounding, than to explain frickin bitcoins, is what I'm saying.

Looks pretty nice but it seems to stall while downloading data.  I'd recommend doing downloads outside the GUI thread.  And also caching, as it seems to re-download the data if I close a tab and re-open.  Otherwise a very useful tool though.  Would love to see support for other-coins.

First, I find it pretty surprising that they felt the need to question him considering he did have $600 in cash.
But honestly... I have no doubt he's a smart guy and a great programmer, but the decision to start explaining something as weird and complicated as bitcoin to the TSA instead of coming up with a more reasonable explanation that wouldn't require.. so many words.. really makes me question his logic skills.  (Example: "My friend is going to give me $1500 when I get to Seattle.  Here, let me call him for you.")
Maybe he's naive and doesn't know about the TSA reputation, but I would never start explaining something like bitcoin to anyone in airport security.

How about a [link]( huh?

Just out of curiosity, how would you have predicted this particular fall?  I'm looking mostly at MACD and saw that it was on a downtrend but I don't see how it could indicate that this latest fall would be so drastic.  I'd like to learn though.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:24:29
I'll put myself in the blind category lol.. fortunately not much money on my part, but just enough to keep me interested in the outcome here..
@_date: 2015-10-28 11:10:47
So here's the thing.  In general it seems like it's good, back up to [the trend for the year](  But heck maybe if it flattens out, it'll drop again, so a good time to sell!
But in terms of the last two years, [it's still way down!]( but kind of seems to be bottoming out.. good time to buy?
Unfortunately, in terms of the all-time price since the beginning of bitcoin, the overall [logarithmic upward trend]( is almost surely *broken* now, so can we expect it to drop, in the next year or two?  Definitely sell!
My personal interpretation? Who fucking knows.  If anything, getting into bitcoin has made me not trust technical analysis one bit.  Charts are next to useless.  (Alternately: I am crap at interpreting them.)  All I know is that I would have done way better if I had simply kept the bitcoins I bought back when they were at 12$, and never sold or bought, thinking I could predict the price.
The [parable of the Taoist farmer]( comes to mind.

That makes:
* this
* rafflebit.com
* betco.in
* btcontilt.com
I got told in another post for using the word "gambling" but that sure is a lot of new "games of chance where you can win BTC" that I've learned about just in the last 2 days.  Is it a new trend, or am I just late for the party?  Not that I think there's anything wrong with a little responsible gambling, but man I can't wait for the media to pick up on this.
@_date: 2013-07-29 12:15:16
Maybe they tried to bribe them with bitcoin ;)

What makes you think bitcoin is related to privacy?  All transactions are recorded in a big shared database.
