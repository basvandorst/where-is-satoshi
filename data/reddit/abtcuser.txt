 &gt; If the world undergoes another global financial crisis similar to 2008, for example, each one of our members will be able to withdraw their account balance, in full, at any time. Our members are safe in the knowledge that the value they store with us is 100% safe, 100% available, 100% of the time in our reserve.
Yet, they do hold at least some part of their reserves as deposits at traditional banks. So, not sure if the above is precise and accurate.

There is another option that I came across recently: [buyer.md]( They buy BTC with 7% and sell with 5% comission. Most likely eventually goes through BTC-e.

Not at all clear what Crypto Capital Bank does with the deposits. No hint that it is a full-reserve institution.


That said, an institution that is trustworthy, secure, and really full-reserve is strictly-speaking superior to a bank (that subjects a large part of the deposits to counter-party risk by lending them out). But in practice, the risk that a US bank will default on your deposit is negligible compared to the multitude of risks with any of these crypto-shops, even if they are full-reserve, like bitreserve. For somebody without access to US banks, though, the case with a local bank is likely the opposite.

So, how much for a megabit per second for second? Or are they planning to charge for traffic (not bandwidth)? 
How does one price either? Basing price off of two year contracts makes no sense since pay-as-you-go pricing needs to be way higher to come even close to compensaing the supplier who would be paying for the contract. Can't let demand alone auto-price it either because demand will almost always be near zero because wifi range is tiny.

Bitcoin's superiority you are so excited about is a reason to use it, not to hold it. Let bitcoins go circulate, hold your long-term assests in stable low-volatility forms.
If you explicitly want to earn income as a trader/speculator, then this brave-new-world mumbo-jumbo should be irrelevant to you.
(Incidentally, bitreserve seems to an interesting way to achieve this combination of use-btc-hold-others, esp. if you don't have access to first-world fin services or if you need easy global access to your funds. Risky, though.)

Get cash at ATM from your card. Then, use one of the many e-payment services that have payment terminals installed throughout public places. Deposit to one of those wallets, then deposit to btc-e.com directly, or use an online exchanger to btc-e vouchers, or an online exchanger direct to BTC. Alternatively, some terminals might support direct exchanges into BTC.
Usually an e-payment wallet requires just a phone number, not much else for moderate transaction amounts. These terminals are like mushrooms in eastern europe but are totally incompatible with US.

BitWage + a Bitcoin debit card (WageCan, ANX, [others]( is an option. But, this seems much more complicated and more expensive in fees than just a simple MyVanilla Debit Card, which accepts direct deposit.
@_date: 2015-07-27 00:21:38
The service probably will just do what you would do manually: some combo of exchange and wire transfers. I doubt they have resources/partnerships in every country. In any case, are there any grounds at all for trusting this?
@_date: 2015-08-31 20:20:35
A service like this (and equivalently, like tether.to) might become useful when it is provided by established banks in the user's jurisdiction.
As it stands now, there's too little gain for the enourmous risk of trusting the gateway and of having you money stored in some far-away bank (e.g. tether.to stores it in two Hong Kong banks, iirc).

Gyft.com for groceries. But, yeah, what is the point of "getting paid in Bitcoin" (aka. exchange on payday), when you can exchange on any day instantly using one of many different exchanges? Bitwage method seems to be restricting possibilities instead of opening any up.

radpad charges rent to a debit card with no fee and mails a check to landlord in us. Non US issued cards are accepted. A debit card loadable with BTC let's you pay rent in btc subject to card fees only.

If depositing to the recipient’s bank account is an option, then I think services like Cashila would do the trick: specify IBAN and send BTC. Never tried it myself, though.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:35:08
If you plan on doing this regularly, send your beneficiary a debit card reloadable with BTC. You load it, they use it to purchase goods and services or get cash at ATM. 
Obviously, calculate the cost in fees for your use case, but it is competitive to LocalBitcoins (the exchange rate premium charged by lb sellers is very large I my experience, compared to card xch rate premium).
Example card providers: e-coin.io advcash xapo bitx

Most likely they selectively scammed you (speaking from experience). You can try posting to the bitcoin talk thrwad -- some posts there imply that some people got their money back eventually (fwiw, I didn't). So far had no problems when playing around at BM.io. but of course can't be sure about whoes running these services.
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:46:30
I don't understand, then. You have issuers who are established banks in, for example, US? If so, this would be a very big step up from tether.to.
If the gateway goes under, there may be some liquidity on some exchanges, but would that liquidity be enough? There's not much liquidity in USDT right now, for example (perhaps, because it is early, perhaps because there never will be much, who knows). Would the issuer honor these tokens/IOUs directly? If so, what is the mechanism of them doing so? Thanks.

Fwiw, bitwage is one way, they will receive part of your paycheck and exchange it to BTC immediately, then pay you in these BTCs. But, this no different from you yourself just exchanging some fiat into BTC on pay day.

Just transferred to Namecheap. Thanks! Been using Gyft and buying hosting via BTC already. Also, I'm going to try remitting funds via a Bitcoin debit card soon.
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:22:17
The cheapest way to remit money internationally. You load from anywhere, your beneficiary spends from anywhere. Try doing WU or wires on the same budget.

I have a WageCan card, it's one of the few that ships to US, and is very similar to ANX. It does work fine (did both ATM and POS), but there's hardly any point in using it if your income is USD and not BTC (better to just exchange to BTC on an exchange). WageCan exchange rate loss is high, plus 1-2 days to load card. Card a bit cheap-looking: has no chip, name and number are not embossed (but can be customized), labelled TransForex. The website has typos, but it is legit -- support is responsive and nice.
From research I did for myself recently:
Bit-X it has an inactivity of 0.05 BTC if less than 5 transactions per month. 5 transactions at 0.002 BTC each adds up to a monthly cost of $2.30 (not counting the extra 1% fee per transaction). Auto-conversion from BTC to fiat costs more %. CCEDK also offers the same card.
Also look into e-coin and AdvCash (both same issuer -- Wave Crest Holdings, Gibraltar). AdvCash is cheapest to get: $5 per card. E-coin has comparatively high limits with verification; allows any custom name to be printed on card. There's also cryptopay.me. And there's spectrocoin.com: 7euro to get the card (comparatively cheap), 1euro monthly, 1% to load.

Isn't shipito backwards in this context?
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:18:50
The TOS say that name needs to be real and that they *can* suspend the card and ask for verification at any point in time. Whether they will or not, who knows, and probably depends on how real your fake name looks.
A competitor (AdvCash) with the **same issuer** (Wave Crest), who also offers unverified card accounts subject to limits, actually did block my card after the card was activated but before I could make a single transaction, and required verification to unblock. Wasted the $5 card purchase fee there.
Sidenote: the e-coin card request form has the option to choose the name to be printed on the card, which can be anything and different from the account holder name.

This is basically an IOU, correct? You are just buying a claim on some company's assets. Why do this, when you can just buy Bitcoin directly? Bitcoin may be a commodity but its not like you have to accept deliveries of oil tankers or smth. Perhaps you could put XBT into a tax deferred account like IRA in US, but do any us brokers trade on NASDAQ Nordic?

Get a virtual card instead of waiting for plastic. It's instant on e-coin and advcash. The fees are lower too.

Does bitcoin impede government's ability to collect taxes? If so, what is to be done about it? Would corporate collections be sufficient? (Avoiding taxes on the pretext of not funding wars is a shortsighted view - roads, schools, research grants, and spaceships come from taxes.) Thanks for considering asking this question.
