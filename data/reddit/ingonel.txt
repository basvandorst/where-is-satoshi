And what was the reaction of Colgate, GM, Pepsi etc. for allowing them to pay in BTC? How did you find common language with them?

If you're smart enough to figure out how to use bitcoin, you can probably deal with it

Wow! That's funny and trully. Like your metaphor - sounds really good and fresh. What can you tell about MtGox?

For sure network and decentralization based systems will break all the hierarchies. So we're on the right way.

That's sounds funny, but it would work nicely as a parody to MtGox
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:45:25

Only bitcoin, I don't see something profitable in other stupid cryptocoins
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:33:27
I agree with your point of view - I also think that  Andeas Antonopoulos is the man who is the best specialist in Bitcoin so maybe this meeting will be really helpful for our community
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:27:29
And what about banks freezing accounts for dealing with bitcoin? Are there any cases of this shit?
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:22:03
I think we shouldnt take it too seriously, it dumps dollar bills
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:29:38
there always be someone who declare such thing. Just believe in your own thoughts. Cause there as many people who think it is growing right now as people who have opposite thoughts about BTC.
