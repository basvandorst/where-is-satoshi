I understand that. And it wouldn't be pleasant, but increased transaction fees could lure them back to hobble through until the difficulty adjustment. It's not the coin ending scenario he was trying to convey it as. There is a lot of hash power devoted to tons of alt coins because they are more profitable. BCH doesn't have the corner are drawing hash power away from BTC.

And perhaps more importantly, adoption yes. It's not great right now, but a path is in place for scaling. Market share counts for a whole lot. Every other coin will have to fight tooth and nail for share. BTC has it and I think they will fix the issues before they lose it. That said, I'm still looking at alt coins for a portion of my portfolio as a hedge. Time will tell.

I tend to agree with this. If we trade sideways for a bit here I think we're headed back down. I've kept some cash available in case we see lower lows still. Coming into Christmas weekend I think volume tapering off is a real possibility that may push things lower. Could go either way, though. With the bounce in market cap for cryptos in general this may come alive like a beast. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:08:51
This is entirely possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:04:57
Also possible, but probably not by Christmas.

Um... yeah, exactly. They aren't out there as an excess supply driving the price down. Ever heard of supply and demand? These guys aren't talking about hodling vs trading. They are talking about hodling vs selling.

Looks great!
How do you do stencil work with powder coating? I know there is electrical bonding to keep powder in place, but wouldn't stencil removal for the baking step cause a flurry of powder to fall off the stencil that would then find its way to the wrong places on your substrate?

Dude, this is a great story. Please come back and make you own post with details of how everything went. I saw you mentioned they are far from you, but I'm sure you'll get calls. Tell us how they react, please! 
Just a great plot here... confused/unenthused reception&gt;forgetting all about it&gt;catching wind of BTC at 1k, looks for key but  can't find it, disappointed, tries to forget the whole thing&gt;catches wind of 5k, incredulous at one's own laziness, kicking oneself now&gt;keeps an eye on price out of morbid curiosity as it moves to 8k and 10k, begins to become depressed&gt; watches breakout movements to 19k, feels soul crushing regret, the kind you feel in your body&gt;Christmas day 5 years later, a cryptic code, confusion on what it is, is this a prank 0.0001BTC from that same family member just to rub it in? What an ass!&gt;Self hatred turns toward original giver, calls to let him have it. While shouting finally hears them repeating "it's your BTC, it's your BTC from 5 years ago, I kept the key". &gt;dead silence as they digest and comprehend what they just heard, expressions  of disbelief, further convincing from the giver, finally allowing oneself to consider this may not be a cruel prank, asking how they can see it, being walked through how to look it up, confirmation of the claim, rising and erupting euphoria! 
This story/experience will be remembered and reflect on for the rest of you and your families lives. Remember that one time? Just absolutely epic. Let us know how it really goes down.

I get the frustration over high transaction fees, but if you want to move your BTC and not get stuck then you should simply increase the mining fee on your transaction. Should they be lower, sure. Will they be in the future, I sure hope so. Does it suck that they aren't right now, of course it does. But getting a transaction to confirm is fully within your control. You just have to pay for it. Don't be cheap if you want your coin to actually move.

Merry Christmas! Wish I was in Cryptos/BTC back then. I'm just a recent (November) buyer. Technology wise I believe BTC is the more solid approach, but I wouldn't have minded having free money! The question with these forks is whether or not they erode the market hold of BTC. For most others it hasn't been much more successful than other alt coins. However, BCH is in the top 3 share wise and has the potential to detract from BTC value in a meaningful way. I'm crossing my fingers that we see scalability fixes before folks decide the compromises of BCH are "worth" the usability today. I don't think they are, but there is no telling what the masses may decide on the matter.

You bring up an interesting question. This is the very reason that governments try to impose some level of steady inflation, because of the motivation I am about to illustrate...
BTC is a fixed quantity, it's deflationary in nature. If I hold my BTC it will be worth more tomorrow or next year in comparison to fiat currencies. As such, it behooves me to hold it and not spend it. If BTC stabilizes and isn't making these big surges anymore, it still becomes something I don't really want to spend because it does become a digital gold. Instead of making gains with it I will then want to hold it for my retirement years as something that will not deflate. Bottom line, I might not sell, but I might not spend it either. This very motivation is why governments impose some level of inflation. When your dollar is worth more today than it will be tomorrow then it is much easier to part with for goods and services today. 
I'm a bit new to the crypto arena, but I do kind of subscribe to the idea that BTC will become the store of value medium going forward. Perhaps all the scaling issues will be solved and it becomes the primary currency. However, what I think is more likely is that BTC remains the store of value that people keep their savings in and they convert to some alt coin with some level of inflation programmed into them for our everyday spending. 
The part that I'm interested to find is at what point does holding a deflationary asset become less profitable than investing in conventional stocks again? If BTC takes hold the rate of coin loss will be interesting to see as it will affect the value increase for holding. In a steady state will it grow by 7% a year, making it competitive with investment in actual business, or will it settle and only gain 2%-3% a year such that moving to a stock type investment becomes more attractive.  If that becomes the case then I could see it still being a spendable asset. If it doesn't, it's going to be really hard for people to part with something that will be worth more tomorrow.

It's the result of insane gains that are not sustainable without consolidation.

Thanks. I am aware of the chart. Interested to buy any final lows just  before/during/after a real reversal. Looking to confirm a reversal on a 1 day chart for a buy would mean buying after the opportunity had already passed.

His argument about hash rate is pure bullshit. If there are transactions with fees to be collected, then there will be miners to crunch the numbers. It might get expensive in the unlikely perfect storm he described, but it sure as hell won't bring it to a halt.

So the financial pundits forgot about how supply and demand works? I guess they failed Econ 101. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:32:42
Looking at the latest 2 hour and under charts, their turn upwards is already failing. Looks like you called this one right. Glad I've still got some cash ready to go. I'm recent to the market, but not so recent that this consolidation ever put me in the red. Been dollar cost averaging in on the dips and looking to put the last of my designated cash into BTC on this downturn. Keeping an eye on it to find the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:14:49
yeah, I know. Do you even read your own comments, bro?
Your hashtag reads " as in the fourth son of Jacob, and not " as in Judas Iscariot, the betrayer. I was just being a dick about your mis-type.

I think you'd enjoy learning about "the ceremony" as it relates to zcash. There was a radiolab episode about it and it was pretty fascinating.

Because you owe the government your taxes when the income is realized. This is why your employer withholds income tax from your pay checks. That money goes to the government immediately. Filing of your tax return is simply the settling up process, where some times you get a refund of excess taxes paid (via withholding) and some times you owe a bit. If you end up owing any significant amount, Uncle Sam gets grumpy. They want that money to hold and use as the year progresses.  If you owe a significant amount at the end of the year, or have two years in a row owing something less significant, but still owing, they can require you to file quarterly returns to ensure they get their money in a timely manner in the future.

So, you've been in BTC for a whole year now? /s ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:55:31
^^yes. Also because large moves can happen while one is sleeping.

The mempool has some 90k transactions in it. I don't think you are going to see a confirmation on your transaction for some time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:35:27
Mempool is backed up due to all the volume surge today. Confirmations will take longer than normal.

There is still a miner fee, but the exchange pays it for you as they batch out their transactions.

Gemini is charting again as of 12:05 pm  PST, based on charts available at bitcoinity.org. If you have limit buys set they may still be fulfilling even if you can't sign into your account. Fingers crossed.
