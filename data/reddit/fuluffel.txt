You require email confirmation to turn off email confirmation for withdrawals, right? If not, I suggest you immediately add that or make email confirmations mandatory and impossible to disable.
Seems incredibly important to me as otherwise an attacker can just disable email confirmation on your account and the feature would be absolutely useless.

April 11 13:55 UTC puts that attack a full day after the ATH.   
The attack seems to start right about where gox flatlines on that chart, which makes sense...

I'm sorry for your loss. You took a risk and it went ugly (at least right now, the future is still uncertain). That happens sometimes. You'll grow to accept it sooner or later.
Have some clichéd quotes:
"This too shall pass."
"Life isn't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward."
Hang in there, buddy! You're wiser and still alive. Explain to your wife how truly sorry you are, that you screwed up, that you love her, and that you were only trying to help your family. I hope things work out for you. Losing money is hard but ultimately there are far worse things to lose. Life goes on, just differently.

No worries.
I don't know. They might not have the resources or connections to do a DDOS attack. If spamming a few hundred small trades is all it takes (and that was indeed sufficient before Gox's upgrades) then that's a very cheap way of achieving the same goal.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:15:45
You're exaggerating what I said. I'm all for negative feedback and expression of opinions. There's a world of difference between that and just mocking somebody, as you well know. I don't know what kind of mockery you had in mind, I didn't take that part of your comment very seriously. I was thinking more of the kind that some others have suggested -- turning him into a meme or whatnot.  FWIW I upvoted your original comment. Does that help you understand my point of view?
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:32:37
Let's not mock him at all, shall we? Acting like a bunch of children doesn't help anyone, and only breeds animosity towards bitcoin and its immature proponents.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:02:26
They are? They don't seem particularly on it to me as the same kind of attack has been done now and then for a while now. Gox obviously has the account info of the bot owner so what's the holdup?
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:27:53
That's an excellent point. They, or someone else, is doing that as well: 
If I wanted to be really conspiratorial (and why not go all out while I'm at it?) I'd say the fact that this looks more like a bot malfunctioning may be a good reason to pay a little extra for it. 
A few dollars more is completely irrelevant anyway when an attacker can easily make $100k from successfully causing a panic selloff (say 15% profit on 5k btc).
I don't know. Your argument is certainly the best I've heard yet against all this, but not quite enough to convince me entirely.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:44:00
But in this case the offers don't seem to have been larger than 0.01, right? I don't see how they could have been, do you? Unless you can make offers larger than your account balance and get around the limitation that way. I wouldn't be terribly surprised...
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:55:12
I'm not suggesting they should block bot trading entirely. Like I said, just bots that are obviously trying to wreck their system. Surely you don't _really_ think the miniscule profit from those bots outweigh all the shit Gox takes in the media when their system goes down?
I can understand Gox not wanting to take action for philosophical reasons though, e.g. wanting to interfere as little as possible with the market.
Or maybe they're just swamped and a little incompetent. That seems the most likely explanation in my view.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:29:02
The lag is what causes the price drop. When people don't have access to up-to-date trading information they get nervous. It's not hard to start panic selloffs under those conditions as we've seen time and time again. The attacker just needs enough btc to sell to get the ball rolling.
@_date: 2013-04-28 15:23:01
The "attack"'s purpose isn't to take down Gox, but to affect the price  in order to make money.
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:46:42
Yes, that's certainly a good idea for individual short-term profit, though perhaps less ideal for bitcoin as a whole. Excessive extreme volatility is probably not a good thing long term, right?
@_date: 2013-04-26 00:29:12
By overloading the trading system and causing lag. If all it takes are pennies then so much the better for an attacker. I'm sure you agree that this has been an effective attack vector previously? But yes, the upgrades have done some good for sure.
I realize this _could_ be two trading bots affecting each other's decisions. The timing (after big sells and trade patterns that looked like a concerted effort to bring the price down), the specific decreasing volumes, and the known efficacy of this kind of attack in generating lag makes me doubt that's the case though.
This doesn't necessarily apply to you, but I really don't get why some people are so hesitant to believe someone would do this. Surely everyone realizes there's _lots_ of manipulation going on in all sorts of ways, trying to move the price in different directions? I trust most people have noticed that trade engine lag usually results in a (mostly temporary) price drop if it keeps up for a while. 
So, 6-step guide to riches:
1. sell
2. cause lag
3. sell some more
4. watch price continue to drop as others sell
5. buy
6. profit
It's not rocket science.

you get the idea. This bot is buying a ridiculously small amount of btc, immediately selling it for a lower price, then buying as much as he can again at the higher price, and selling at the lower. Repeat. 
The account is _losing_ money on this. That's unimportant to them though as they're making a lot more profit by lagging down Gox and making killings by trading in the confusion and panic.
The really fucked up part is Gox can obviously see which account is doing these trades and yet they're not doing shit about it.
I realize Gox is profiting (short term) off increased trade, but FFS. Take some responsibility, Gox! Perhaps they need to enforce some ground rules and not just bend over completely to every scammer and manipulator imaginable?
EDIT: unfortunately the color-coding was lost in translation... The higher price transactions are buys and the lower price are sells. Also note that they're ordered with the latest transaction first. I just copy/pasted from  Guess I should've taken a screenshot instead...

I don't know. I guess it's possible there wasn't any conventional ddos, but there seems to have at the very least been trading bots designed to sabotage their system and cause lag. A ddos by any other name... would crash Gox all the same.

Yeah, some kind of distributed exchange system could be really great... Will be interesting to see what the future brings.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:52:38
Maybe I should explain further: if you look at the transaction list you can see that a bot is repeatedly buying at 145.00000 and then selling the same amount at 144.90000. The volume gets lower and lower because the bot has to pay fees and is also losing a little on each trade from buying high and selling low. 
A few minutes prior to this the (presumably) same bot burned through almost an entire btc doing the same thing.
This is obviously not a legitimate trading strategy... You don't make money by repeatedly losing money.
I also don't believe this is simply a buggy bot for several reasons:
* the same thing has happened several times before. I've got another screenshot from the 15th.
* the timing coincides very well with big selloffs.
* flooding the Gox trading engine is a well known attack vector.
* Occam's razor ffs. First a couple of big selloffs, then this shit starts. You realize there's a lot of money to be made by selling high, creating panic (through lag) causing others to sell, and then buying again low, right?

I didn't just mean the 0.01btc bots though. You've got a fair point about the relatively low income from those.
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:31:52
I'm pretty sure the transaction volume you see there isn't restricted to unique bitcoins. That is, an unspecified percentage of that volume is the same bitcoins being moved more than once. So no, "15-25% of all the bitcoins in existence" don't change hands every day.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:34:13
Yes, it's possible that someone decided to cash out and that that had absolutely nothing to do with the repeated attempts to cause lag, panic, and selloffs immediately before the cash out. It just seems pretty unlikely. 
That doesn't really matter though, the point is that the bot doing these trades seems to have been _trying_ to cause lag (-&gt;panic-&gt;selloffs-&gt;rebuy-&gt;profit), regardless of whether its actions actually succeeded this time or not.
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:59:11
I think they've already starting doing that. I seem to recall reading something about it the other day.

Thanks for clarifying that. Could you be more verbose?
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:59:30
No? The trades are obviously done by the same bot. Trying to cause lag and panic is the only reason I can see for doing the losing trades. Please enlighten me if you think I'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:12:01
I expect Gox to protect their business from attacks. Banning some bots that are actively trying to sabotage their system doesn't seem unreasonable to me. Also, what tearr said.

What a beautiful world that would be :D
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:19:55
Yeah, absolutely, you make lots of good points. Still though, their handling of the situation both during and after looks pretty abysmal from where I'm standing. More than an hour's trading lag is simply not acceptable and is certain to wreak havoc on a market, and that press release reads like a bad joke.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:11:02
A business taking measures to protect its interests doesn't seem incompatible with bitcoin in any way. You would prevent said business from doing so?
You're talking about bitcoin and regulation in the same sentence. You do realize that, right?
@_date: 2013-04-26 00:50:18
True, the sellers are ultimately responsible for selling. That doesn't change my position that trying to cause lag (i.e. DOSing) is a shitty move that Gox should be trying to prevent.
If I was purely economically motivated then that is what I would do, yes. You don't even need to write a bot to profit off the panic sells.
I think the DOSing, panic selling, and resulting _extra_ wild volatility is bad for bitcoin is a whole though. The whole "50% price swing any day in any direction" thing is probably not helping bitcoin to attract merchants and be taken seriously. The fact that bitcoin _still_ manages to attract merchants and serious attention despite the shit storm going on all around it is a testament to how revolutionary and interesting the system is.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:56:49
It's still an attack, just a failed one. They still succeeded in causing a panic selloff shortly afterwards though.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:22:31
I doubt it. Look at the trade volumes:
buy: $145.0 * 0.0072 = $1.044
fee (assuming 0.6%): $145.0 * 0.0072 * 0.006 = $0.006264
sell: $144.9 * 0.0072 = $1.04328
fee: $144.9 * 0.0072 * 0.006 = $0.00625968
so after the first trade pair the bot loses $1.044-$1.04328+$0.006264+$0.00625968 = $0.01324368
Then the next buy uses a slightly lower volume: $145.0 * 0.0071 = $1.0295
Surprise, just what you can afford when starting with $1.044 and losing $0.01324368.
And so on with steadily decreasing volumes until all the money is spent.
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:01:20
The selling of bitcoins is not the issue. It's the attempt to cause lag and subsequent price drops. A normal seller is obviously not interested in trying to cause a bunch of other people to sell so he can get a worse price for his coins.
I don't believe there are any regulations preventing the owner from manipulating the market, no. Nor do I believe he's doing so.
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:14:03


The highest buyer and the lowest seller.


Why should they? No such necessity exists. Who will magically bid more money for a bitcoin just because we increase the mining difficulty? Can we please set the difficulty extremely high and make everyone a billionaire? How high must we set the difficulty for the btc price to be $1M? Let's do it!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:57:29
The attackers start the selloff by selling first, at the highest price. Then the fuckers sit back and wait for people to panic. They'll just keep ddos:ing until people start caving in and panic is officially on. Finally they buy back in at a much lower price and make insane profit. Rinse and repeat. Foul scum.
The exchanges need to suspend trading when they can't handle an attack. They're enabling the frenzy. This is ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:28:08
Yes, absolutely. Perhaps I should've said "You don't make money by just repeatedly losing money". But as part of a larger manipulation scheme, certainly. That's pretty much the idea behind this post.
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:56:54


It doesn't work that way for most people. Losses hurt much more than equal wins make you happy. Some people have the mental endurance to overcome that or not be affected in the first place, some don't. But the money has to be significant for you to feel any real effect. 
You say you're trading with 0.9 btc, and I'm guessing losing it all wouldn't matter much so of course you won't hurt when you lose some of it. 
Imagine you're winning and losing 1k btc instead. Or 10k btc, however much it takes for it to be a significant sum to you. That shit gets stressful real quick.
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:55:59
Whether the selloff in this case was influenced by this bot's behavior or not is irrelevant to the point I'm trying to make. Which is that this bot seems to have spent money on losing trades in an effort to overload the trading system and create lag. 
Like I've said elsewhere, I could be wrong but I have yet to hear a good alternative explanation.
Lots of people (not you) seem butthurt in this thread though. I assume a fair share of them are day traders happy to make quick profits off the regular Gox attacks' ensuing wild swings.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:00:21
I think you're reading it wrong. The last column is volume, not price.
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:55:09
Yes. Before Gox's latest upgrades an attacker could bog down the trading system cheaply by spamming lots of small trades. Gox would then grind to a near-halt resulting in people being unable to use the trading system in a timely manner, and the price reporting sites (bitcoinity, clarkmoody, etc) no longer receiving up-to-date price and trading info. 
After a few minutes of this more and more people get nervous and eventually start to panic. All the attacker has to do is sell his (fairly large) btc holdings to start a downward trend. Panicked btc owners (and calm traders trying to make a profit) will then see the price going down and also start selling, driving the price lower and lower. The attacker then rebuys his btc at a much lower price. 
Once the panic subsides and the trading system stops lagging the price usually rebounds to more or less the pre-attack level fairly quickly. 
The attacker (and crafty traders) are left with fantastic profits paid for by the people who panicked and sold and didn't have the skill, nerves, and luck to rebuy at a lower price.
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:34:17
You underestimate me. I'm certainly not going to downvote an intelligent and informative comment. Nor do I feel threatened. I freely admit I could be wrong in all this. This specific event just looks extremely suspect to me, and I have yet to see a to my mind convincing argument as to why I'm wrong.
I think you may be misunderstanding my position. I'm not arguing that bot trading is "bullshit", wrong, or whatever. I have nothing against trading bots that try to profit through efficient trading, HFT or otherwise. 
What I'm saying is that this particular event looks to me like someone is doing unprofitable trades in an effort to bring down Gox's trading engine, which is known to be pretty shitty and easily crumbles when overloaded with too many trade requests.
That would effectively be the same as DOSing Gox. I realize some people are all for hurr-durr-free-market-anything-goes, but DOSing is not part of what I personally consider legitimate trading.
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:23:31
Yes, I can. The tiny orders are not in themselves what's causing Joe Richpants to sell his coins. Prior to Gox's latest upgrades you could easily overload their trading system by spamming lots of small trades. This would then cause _heavy_ lags, both when trying to place orders  and when trying to see what trades were happening right now as opposed to x minutes earlier. 
Traders already jittery from the obscene volatility inherent in bitcoin would then get even more jittery when not having access to reliable data, and not being able to place trades reliably.
An attacker could quite easily trigger a price drop under those conditions by simply selling a bunch of btc, before and/or during the lag. The nervous (and often inexperienced) traders saw the price dropping and had no way of knowing exactly what the current price was. It takes a special kind of zealot to not sell at least some of their btc holdings when the price just keeps dropping. Enough non-zealots and you've got a chain reaction.
Fortunately the latest Gox upgrades seem to have made their trading system a lot more resilient to this kind of attack.
I know I can't prove the same bot is on both sides. It just seems a very plausible scenario to me given everything that has happened the last month or so. But yes, I could certainly be wrong. It seemed worth making a post about at the time, but maybe that was stupid. There are apparently a _lot_ of people here who have taken great offense at my idea. Experienced traders with no real interest in bitcoin other than as a day trading instrument are also profiting greatly off the panic episodes and obviously have no interest in seeing the attacks and volatility stop.
Are you buying any of this?
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:55:02
How about they spend a BTC or two per day on a guy whose only job is to issue press releases in a timely manner?
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:41:06
No, not directly from this bot's efforts. Gox's upgrades seems to have done some good. The lag only came when loads of people started panic selling some minutes later.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:52:17
No, "pal", I'm not. I realize however that the color-coding indicating buy/sell was lost when I pasted the text though. Doh. If you can't figure out the pattern by looking at the decreasing volumes you're just gonna have to trust me. The buy/sell information was clearly visible on clarkmoody when I copied it. You don't seem very interested in trusting me though. :) You're not the owner of that account, are you?
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:36:19
They should block bots that are trying to sabotage the trading system, in my opinion.
Yes, with a better trading system this wouldn't be an issue. We're not yet there though.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:28:35

They are separate assertions. Panic can be caused by things other than lag, but lag can cause panic. I.e. lag is one way of causing panic, but not the only way.

I agree it was probably a good thing long term. A decent drop while still not going abysmally deep may have been just what the doctor ordered -- a much needed reality check.

A couple of things...
1) Communicate DURING problems. As far as I can tell no one heard anything from you for something like 5 hours, while your site and everything around it was going up in smoke.
2) Are you officially OK with _all_ sorts of price manipulation? At least one of your customers was running a bot designed to spam large numbers of unprofitable microscopic trades. It was literally paying to sabotage your trading system and cause lag and panic in order to then make more money exploiting the panic. Are you fine with this? That seems very shady at best. Here's a more detailed explanation: 
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:15:55
Good news everyone! You can still contribute your computing power to the bitcoin network. You don't get paid _at all_ for running a Tor node, but you _do_ get paid for running a bitcoin node. You'll probably (and probabilistically) only make more than the electricity costs you if you're using sufficiently efficient mining equipment though. 
Contributors get rewarded in direct proportion to how much computing power they contribute to the network. That simple rule makes everyone try to contribute as much as possible as efficiently as possible. Normal desktop computers just aren't efficient enough to make money mining anymore, and so most people don't spend money running those miners. If you want to strengthen the network and don't mind paying to do it then by all means mine away.
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:05:13
Assuming they're made by the same bot or at least the same controlling owner/group (which is what I assume, and the entire premise behind this post), they're unprofitable trades made in an effort to DOS Gox's trading system and eventually induce panic sells.

It's simple math. If you buy 0.0060 btc at 178.53399 and sell them at 172.1 you lose about $0.04 (plus Gox's trade fee). They're losing a couple of cents on each buy-sell pair.
Do you understand or should I explain further?

This doesn't look like bots fighting each other though, but rather just one bot spending a little money trying to trigger the old Gox Lag, right? Of course, only Gox can tell for sure, and it would be nice if they did. Sure, it could still be an attack if there were two bots involved and the attacker controlled both. In that case even Gox couldn't be certain...
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:39:01
I don't see how that is. I think you're still missing something. There's a buy order of unknown depth at 172.1 and a sell order of unknown depth at 178.53399. The bot then repeatedly bought about half a dollars worth of btc at the high price and sold them again at the lower. You as another trader could only prevent that by buying the entire sell order and/or selling the entire buy order, in which case the bot would no doubt just munch on the next orders in line.

DDOS confirmed both on their twitter and facebook.

Could you please briefly explain what I'm not understanding? Are you saying the trades I quoted are just an insignificantly losing part of a larger strategy that's believed to be +ev overall? (Well, that's obviously true in the scenario I'm proposing where the object of the losing trades is to overwhelm Gox's flaky trading engine, but apart from that as well?)
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:05:11
Great idea. Go for it!
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:51:09
You, like many others here, seem to misunderstand what this post is all about. This is not an anti-bot post. It's just anti-bot-explicitly-trying-to-cause-lag. Read some of my other comments in this post to understand what (I think) is going on.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:07:20
 There's a checkbox for "custom time". 
The charts in the OP are from  though. You can zoom in/out with mousewheel, click-and-drag to move in time, and use different "Period" settings to choose temporal granularity.

The particular bots I'm concerned about, or at the least the behavior I'm concerned about, only has to do with small trades. I have nothing against bots in general, nor bots doing small trades necessarily, just bots explicitly trying to cause lag.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:55:53
What they get in fees from these low-volume trades are surely insignificant compared to the PR mess they suffer and everything that brings with it in terms of lost customers etc.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:57:41
Oh, and my use or non-use of Gox is irrelevant. The entire bitcoin ecosystem is obviously heavily affected by what happens at Gox.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:12:32
Not odd at all imho. $1M is nothing to some people/companies, and with the way the market is going it seems a reasonable assumption that getting the coins a bit sooner is worth paying a little extra for. And Gox have proven themselves trustworthy over and over, which is also nice.
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:37:47
Why not do both? Also, please note I'm not complaining about bots in general, but just intentionally abusive bots.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:24:11
While I'm not saying there's not a lot of manipulation going on (there certainly is), I don't think a sharp rise over a 30 minute period is particularly odd necessarily. 
How do you expect someone wishing to buy say 10k btc fast to get them without burning through a lot of asks? Sure they might spend several hours buying at a slower pace and giving the sellers a chance to replace the consumed asks, but that's a lot of time (and money). And of course, "panic buying" is kind of a thing just like panic selling. No one wants to get left behind.
The thing is that once someone has raised the btc price by buying then people in general seem pretty disinclined to bring the price back down again. Perhaps not surprising given how hard it is to put a good price tag on bitcoin, and who wants to sell for less than they can get? Eventually the price gets high enough that people get too jittery and then something starts a chain selloff bringing the price down to a comfortable level again. 
Or so I think. We're all greedy sheep in the great herd. Baaaaa!

I have a hard time classifying _this_ as legitimate trade though: 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:27:45
That's just beautiful. Thanks for posting this, and doing what you're doing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:55:45
MagicalTux is indeed the owner. Perhaps you'll have more luck trying to contact Mt.Gox on twitter? 
Or maybe not:








Then again, raising the min fee is not the exact same thing as raising the min volume. Perhaps they'd be more open to higher fees.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:26:29
Well, they're certainly losing _some_ customers because of the attacks. And the overall PR is hardly good for them...
I don't mind bots in general, just the ones whose only purpose is to sabotage the trading platform.
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:45:50
I really should've said something in the title about this not being about bots per se, but rather just bots actively trying to break down the trading system.
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:59:38
Yes. Quite refreshing to see the attacker failed to bring Gox down this time. It's a shame Gox just lets the attacker continue trying to destroy their system though. They've got the damned account number[s] so what's the holdup? 
There have been theories that these incidents are just the effects of a buggy trading bot. I'd say the chance of that is pretty damn slim now, what with the repeated occurrences and perfect timing with other attempts to induce panic selloffs.
I'd bet good money the filth controlling the attacking account also have control over the account[s] that did the big selloffs immediately prior to these attacks...
Good on Gox for not crumbling this time. Now punish the fuckers responsible as well!
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:19:04
I was explaining how this attack could cause a price drop by creating lag. In this case the bot's trade spamming failed to break Gox's upgraded servers and cause lag.
The panic selling happened shortly afterwards anyway. Eventually enough people got convinced that a price drop was imminent and started selling. This then created lag, more selling, more lag, more selling, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:50:42
I appreciate what you're saying. But you know, I'm not sure the attacker could care less about what some dudes on reddit think about his actions. And if he does, the attack profits could buy him a lot of therapy.
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:35:10
Do you have proof of this? Otherwise, by Occam's razor, I'm gonna have to conclude you're just talking out of your ass.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:28:18
That's a really good question. Perhaps the API the bots use don't have that limit?
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:30:35
You're doing it right. Keep having fun and good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:19:20
Making money by preying on confusion and fear. Cause lag with lots of small orders and ddos, trade the resulting swings, sell high, buy low, profit.

@_date: 2013-12-09 23:39:00
Nothing prevents miners from testing just odd nonces though, right? And they wouldn't have a lower probability of finding a valid one that way. They're just cutting the search space in half, but also the number of solutions, i.e. it doesn't matter.
So there's nothing saying the odds of the next block's nonce being even is 50/50, is my point. Though I'm guessing most miners do test random nonces in practice.
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:51:44
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:20:39
Aah, sorry for the confusion. I'll go look for my tinfoil hat instead.
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:35:59
Like I've said several times in this post, I'm not arguing for banning bots in general. I'm just against bots trying to break the trading system on purpose. It's essentially not very different from a DDOS, just cheaper and less efficient.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:53:12
Maybe the fact there's already 11M btc out there? Any newly mined coins are just a very small fraction of that. If all miners suddenly decided not to sell their coins for less than $1K each then plenty of other holders still would.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:54:19
It works by creating confusion and panic and trading the resulting swings.

Seriously, WTF? Your horribly inept trading system played a major role in causing a pretty big crash/correction/whatever, lots of grief, and economic losses. 
Your comment afterwards is "Hey guys, due to the chaos we helped inflict our profits for today are up almost 200%! Let's take a moment together to celebrate how impressive things were!"
lol. Wow.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:07:00
I'm certainly no expert on HFT, but I fail to see how this can be a +ev trading strategy. Please explain if you _really_ understand what's going on. Perhaps you're just not looking close enough at what's happening in the screenshot?
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:14:49
Ah. Yes, I admit it's possible there's some non-scammy explanation for the bot's behavior. I doubt  as the numbers fit together so well and make so much sense.  is an interesting thought though. So yeah, I seem to have been a little too certain of shenanigans initially, but I still think it warrants looking into by Gox. They obviously can't handle the trade load so a malevolent or malfunctioning bot should be the first to go imo.
And if you don't mind me asking, are you the operator of another exchange? I doubt you'd spend time defending Gox's integrity in that case though :) Your "the method I use" has me curious.
