So if people opened one channel a week to month then current capacity could possibly serve betwern 20-80 million people. 
Thats a start.
Then in a year or two we could easily double that or more with a block size increase or some other future idea

I'm leaning both ways on this.
Pro: It promotes Bitcoin by using the brand name and it builds on existing brand awareness. 
Con: Existing brand awareness is not necessarily positive for the layman, tying bitcoin to drugs and such. Hence "bits" might be a fresh start for the reputation. 
Anyhow I'm not sure...

I would assume that he is rather pointing to the technological aspect. If you look at the picture you see how he is showing google using 80's technology which never could have happened. Therefore, what I think he is implying is that bitcoin has yet to see its own google and etc.

"Bitcoin is in the early stages of mainstreaming today. And the signs that it's in the early stages of mainstreaming are mainstream venture capital firms funding mainstream startups, employing mainstream engineers to build services that'll be used by mainstream people. You've got big companies that are not yet doing a lot with it, but are looking very seriously at it. So every big bank has people that are trying to figure out what to do with Bitcoin; every big e-commerce company has people that are trying to figure out Bitcoin. You have mainstream regulators figuring it out; you've got people at the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury Department and IRS that are figuring it out. At the state level, people are engaged on it. And so, it's in the early stages of mainstreaming."

Three contractors are bidding to fix a broken fence at the White House. One is from Chicago, another is from Tennessee, and the third is from Minnesota. All three go with a White House official to examine the fence. The Minnesota contractor takes out a tape measure and does some measuring, then works some figures with a pencil. "Well," he says, "I figure the job will run about $900. $400 for materials, $400 for my crew, and $100 profit for me." The Tennessee contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says, "I can do this job for $700. $300 for materials, $300 for my crew, and $100 profit for me." The Chicago contractor doesn't measure or figure, but leans over to the White House official and whispers, "$2,700." The official, incredulous, says, "You didn't even measure like the other guys! How did you come up with such a high figure?" The Chicago contractor whispers back, "$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire the guy from Tennessee to fix the fence." "Done!" replies the government official. And that, my friends, is how the new stimulus plan will work.

For my self I believe that the benefits of those system outweigh the negative impact on freedom and rights by giving the many other freedoms and rights that impact the community in a positive way. 
It's about where you think freedom and rights begin. If your freedom and rights should never be imposed then you should be able to steal to keep your self alive. No one should go to prison to protect the many or be punished by the many.
On the other hand if the rights of the many are overhyped we start killing children to curb population growth and blabla Hitler.
So it is in my opinion a compromise somewhere between those two that we find the most success

He is either willfully spouting lies or he hasn't got a clue.  Saying theres a massive inflation in bitcoin because there are 300 other crypto currencies is ignorant. 
I could just as well say that the gold market is overvalued because there are 117 other elements that I can buy.

It's because a long time ago no one else was doing it. The government then stepped in to open thousands of places you could send your stuff between. The government needed to invest in a lot of infrastructure to accomplish this. No company would have been able to do this and so the government did.

Holy mother of. I saw your macro comment today and I thought it was a clever idea but then i had other stuff to do. A few minutes ago I stumbled on a post talking about it while linking to your comment. So I decided to go for it and install RES.
I was looking for the macro option but I gave up and I noticed that I had something in my inbox. When I clicked and saw the amount of the tip I thought to myself... "can it be?"
So i went back and looked at the name of the original poster and YES its YOU!
And lo and behold while writing this to you I notice the macro thing in the corner. Now I can figure this out, in the mean time spread this.

I yhink he meant that you can say you bought it from the other store. Say there are two stores close by each other. You buy tampons in store a) and leave them in your car. Then you enter store b) where you put tampons in your bag with your receipt from store a). Then when the store clerk is going to busts you, you can say that you bought it elsewhere. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 11:03:55
My guesstimate is that he is not only wrong but that this is actually what is stabilising the price.  If one looks at the price history it looks much more stable today than last year.

This is actually a clever idea. I've been meaning to sell a few things I no longer use for cheap and to offer a discount if people pay using bitcoin.  Instead I might just offer the goods for a real good price only for bitcoins. Then I would be backing bitcoin, right?

Hence he suggested an exchange that would generate on chain transactions that carry a transaction fee and by that increase miner fees from transaction fees.

I did not mention inflation, but prices are like velocity you cant say one item has a certain velocity or price without looking at it from a certain point of view. You are looking at this like those things are going up in price but I am pointing out that you could just as well be looking at it like the currency is going down or anywhere between.

Your mom takes bitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-19 05:46:55
But doesn't every little (bit) help? 
Also fees as a percentage of reward would effectively double each time block reward halves while transactions and fees stay stable. 
That means that every % increase in fees will be double the effect when rewards are halfed.
It's not going to give miners much today but longterm it may be very useful for the network so I can't see it as a bad idea to discuss.

I would actually say that it did in fact work quite well. What we learned from that experiment is: Use bits or $ not btc as a unit of measure, tip more than 100 bits, tip when people are deserving it dont spam everything with dust.
Also bitcoin is more famous and usefull due to the network effect etc.
I'm not saying that it is the best way to promote bitcoin but if done right it will.

By that logic the true market cap must have not only doubled. If the full market cap inflation is ~10% and we suspect the "real" inflation to be around 30% then you must add that math to the real market cap calculation

But is it a return from gold or is it mostly the dollar falling. Non the less what he's saying isnt that gold hasnt returned profit but that past performance isn't an indication on future performance. Especially since gold is a non producing asset.

I don't think they could. The easiness of moving in and out of their system without having to "register" too much information about you. As well the network effect is why they (we) use bitcoin not buttcoin.
There is however nothing stopping anyone to try your suggestions and if they can do it, I'll be there.

At least 10x more than zero
@_date: 2014-07-16 10:47:07
It actually does relate to the weakening of the dollar and points at a currency battle that has begun. This creates cracks in the system and that may help bitcoin to slip through the cracks and give it an even better chance.

I meant if you do a fuck up like this as an employee then you might not be super interested in letting your boss know.
@_date: 2018-10-26 03:48:48
I think you are oversimplifying this. You are thinking in a linear way but it will probably be exponential. 
First halvening saw a top of $1.000 and $200 low after that next halvening $19.000 top and $5.500 low.
If that is any indication of next time then we may see $350.000 top and $150.000 low.
I doubt it but it's not impossible 
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:01:56
Your problems are not with bitcoin, it is the monetary system

You need to check those unred emails

At that point yes gox was not at a healthy state. Not liquid, manipulated by a bot and so on. But I ask one thing. Were there people buying btc there? If so, then people were obviously willing to buy btc at that price so ATH IMO. 
But by that logic we must also look at exchanges where premiums exist today. 
So its a choice between three things:
1. Including premiums
2. Taking some kind of average
3. Taking a price from an exchange that was running then and still is.

Did someone actually loose $10m or did someone loose a part of a $10m short?
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:06:36
This is how it goes. It goes up it goes down. This is why people say: 
Only spend what you can afford to loose on btc and then forget it. Dont look at the price.

@_date: 2017-01-04 07:14:39
Now I'm curious. Are you talking about 2 point something mbtc  or 2000 somethimg mbtc?
And also isnt that the ammount that needs to be worth the same as an ounce of gold to be on parity?
Otherwise I can be on parity with anything with some random ammount of it.  
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:15:13
I agree that this is premature as a here and now statement but as a future speculation it is all right to ponder. I think 4 more years should be enough time to see if this is happening and if not much has happened in that time then that is probably not what is happening.

@_date: 2017-01-04 02:41:55
The situation in Venezuela can be a consequential factor by signaling to others to bet on bitcoin, I believe the Indian thing is this as well. 
I don't believe I've seen any evidence that the people within those two countries have played a major role in recent price movement. It might however be that they or people in other countries (as implied earlier) were the small force that caused the avalanche that had been building up since the halving for an example. 
The Chinese capital flight is however a direct proven influencer on price and the Venisuela &amp; India situation only strengthens that in the mind of the Chinese IMO
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:09:50

Well that puts things in to perspective. Its then about 400 btc if the price is still $1k or 4.3 hours worth of mining. 
But still, if it keeps doubling... that would be interesting

I'm looking forward to seeing him being... right
@_date: 2017-01-04 07:29:11
If it grows a few times in similar percentages as last year then 16 becomes 32 and 32 becomes 64 then 64 becomes 128 then 128 becomes 256 and finally 256 becomes 512.
This is 5 doublings away and a factor of 32.
Beautiful numbers, right?

It means that they hold only a tiny amount of bitcoin in relation to other holdings. If bitcoin rises 35% and only accounts for 1% of the fund total gains it is possible to estimate bitcoin to be 1/35 of 1% or about 0.03% of the fund total holdings if i am not wrong.

Aren't people worried about a 51% attack? You only need 10-15% of BTC hashrate to do it on BCH
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:10:36
But they will need to deal with the same scaling issues as Bitcoin. Some believe in off chain scaling others believe in on chain scaling. Bitcoin is betting on off chain and Bitcoin cash is betting on on chain. Having hedge funds going bitcoin shows what they are betting on and so good for Bitcoin

Wouldn't it be better to send out two blocks closer to today's setup. 
What I mean is, one key-block to announce and then a follow up tranaction-block afterwards 
The key-block has a hash or something of the transaction-block and that way you have plenty of time to seed the larger block before the next one is due.
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:15:07

I understand all that but how much delay would an extra megabyte cause? 30 seconds seems like a overestimate to me. 
Do we have any data that shows how much time 600-700-800 kb blocks take to propagate? If there is a significant delay as they grow larger we should have data supporting this.
Edit: thank you for a good answer

The way I understand it is that you gain (don't loose) these 4% if you got bitcoin instead of a currency (yuan) that has a devaluation of 4%. So your net worth is 4% higher with bitcoin than yuan after a set amount of time
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:39:41

Isn't tha a problem in it self, if people perceive other venues moving fast and btc as slow then other venues might look more attractive 
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:56:14
I like it
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:41:17
But if large sums of bitcoins aren't being used wont that drive the price up for everyone and in that way increase buying power for the ones actualy using it. So a win win situation.

I'm guessing that its bad because the effect will catch up eventually 
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:34:18
Okey so I was on the right track thinking this could be a good way to settle bets in p2p style. 
But reading your comment I realise that there are so many other things this could enable. 
Does anyone know if there a source of ideas, preferably a video where the possibilities of smart contract or even smart money is covered?

Yo mama's a bubble:

How is this possible?
"I also found a bunch of weird looking addresses, which nobody will ever be able to spend from.  shows a lot of transactions sending tiny amounts to human-readable addresses, spelling out paragraphs of text."
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:52:32
How about diversifying?
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:14:26
I think this really shows that they are (still) just followers
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:05:50
Why convert to spend if you could just spend btc. Either way you're spending
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:44:41
Thank you

Isn't it 100 keys in a wallet? Not transactions?

Awsome idea, could be called bitcoin basics and include xbtc so newbs can read before they use it. Can you put paper wallets in to a pdf?
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:36:04
Just pointing out that your website doesn't look too good on my mobile otherwise cool story bro

"Good inflation helps money supply grow with the market."
Why does the money supply need to grow?

I don't see why corporate tax or sales tax shouldn't be a substitute to income tax
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:43:58
Isnt it 3% fees?
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:34:58
So uninformed, so it gets up-votes to show it :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:57:49
maybe you should tell the world how skeptical we are.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:57:59
I think this means that the Icelandic government just classified bitcoin as a currency

There is one major problem that I see when people are talking about the market cap of bitcoins, and that is how many bitcoins are in use and how many are dormant. Some people have estimated that up to 40% of bitcoins have been lost and i expect that at least 40% are dormant. 
Considering that I don't think it is fair to take that 15 billion and divide it by the total number of bitcoins. In order to find the "fair price" we need to find out how many bitcoins are in circulation and then and only then we can try to estimate the fair value.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:11:11
You would never spend it? Or would you actually save for the stuff you otherwise would get loans for? would you not eat? How about computers, communication, travel... Would you just do nothing and eat from dumpsters while watching your fortunes grow?

Adding to the 5% leakage is all the work required to handle this shit so don't you think that you could actually save more than 5% if you include the work. Also, you have to think about that the customer is probably getting paid for his work doing the transfer and that probably costs quite a lot. Even if he's not getting paid and doing it on his own time he could be doing something more productive with his time.
Thanks for a good writeup

good balanced article
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:45:41
Actually companies do that already, you don't see companies like stores  saying how many milk bottles they have. However they do say how many dollars worth their milk stock is. So i see no difference in that and companies showing how many dollars worth their bitcoins are.
