Yeah but how much is an ounce of Bitcoin?

Ouch. Those places are costly. But maybe you can get a volume discount.

Plug each one into your PC, run file recovery software on it and them all to a few 3TB+ internal or external HDDs. Then peruse at your leisure to find where your BTC wallet might be. Save what you want and delete everything else.
But if they've failed mechanically, you'll probably need to send them to a professional data recovery company that has equipment to extract and recover from the individual platters inside the HDD.

I appreciated the humor of your comment.
Thank you.

I bought a tiny bit at $924 for, umm, certain purposes. I only spent about half of it and I don't want to spend the rest bc I wanna see it keep climbing. Granted now might be the best time to use it.

Don't pay any tax. :)
Taxation is theft.

Gotta make sure we aren't disobeying our masters. You'd think it would be enough to ask ourselves if we're hurting anyone by our actions and, if not, go ahead with whatever we wanted to do. Unfortunately that's not the case.

Probably extortion is the best fit, since the threat of violence isn't imminent. But they're all types of theft.

Fuck auditing the Fed. End the Fed.
