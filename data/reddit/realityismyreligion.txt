Breaking news:  Bitcoin is volatile
Up next:  Water - is it wet?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:46:27
There, I fixed it.  Check again.

Judging market fluctuations by percentage is the only way that makes sense.
I remember when Bitcoin dropped from $30 to $6 in a week back in 2011.  That was a much more substantial correction than this past week.
If you held $1000 worth of BTC during the respective ATH for each correction, you would have lost more in 2011 than today.

And then LN happens.
I should have sold at $20k just so I could buy more now.

I bought at $1k and I am just along for the ride now.
If it crashes to $5k, I still come out on top.  Of course, if that happens, I will regret not selling at $20k.

Discourage panic selling by shredding your paper wallet.

Before Segwit, BTC was at like $2,000.  A few months after it jumped to $20,000.
If before LN, BTC is at $9,000, then maybe after LN it'll leap to $90,000.
LN will open the floodgates for BTC.  It will be viable for micropayments again.

Good thing I didn't buy Bitcoin back then!  I sure would feel like a sucker today.

Thank you.  Because of this comment, I just cashed out all my BTC/BCH/ETH/LTC.  $400 invested, $3400 withdrawn.  It could have been $4600 the other day, but fuck it.
I had some of that BTC from 2011.  $0.50 in, $750 out.
No complaints!
But you're right.  There will eventually be bagholders, and I don't want to be one of them.
If this crashes again, it could become unmineable.

With that low tx fee, you're gonna be waiting a few more days.
Good thing too, because you sound like you're ready to sell that shit off in a hurry.
Spend the next few days meditating and reading about Lightning Network to get you pumped to HODL once the transaction confirms.

I invested a whopping $81 in my BTC.  Seeing my value rocket to $2.5k was awesome.  Seeing it slide back down to $1.8k hurt.  But in the end, 97% of my net worth is in FIAT, because Crypto is my side-hustle, not my retirement plan.

I did that already, but BTC Core says it's invalid...
It's in some sort of backup format, probably for Android, I just don't know what app...
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:30:00
Better price to but more.

You know that fees are built into Bitcoin, right?  Coinbase only charges a fee for buying - you know, like every exchange ever.

Next year it will be $50k.
Two years later it will be $250k.
Two years after that, it will be $1M, bringing the market cap to $21,000,000,000,000, becoming the dominant currency of Earth.
By 2030 it will be $1 trillion/satoshi after hyperinflating the USD into worthlessness.
Then, in 2035, a quantum computer will brute force every wallet in existence, and steal all the Bitcoin, forcing humanity to confront existence without the concepts of money or wealth.

Lightning network is on the way.  Calm down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:05:52
They most certainly can.  It doesn't mean that the prediction will be correct, but it's better than just assuming everything to be random.

I found an old wallet from when it was $10.  This is like a rollercoaster, I always feel like I might die, but the end result has a 0% chance of not being profitable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:51:03
Buy high, sell low!
Invert those gains!
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:28:38
That's dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:57:25
I was joking, lol.  You gotta wait in line with everyone else.
Should have paid a higher tx fee if you needed it in a hurry.
