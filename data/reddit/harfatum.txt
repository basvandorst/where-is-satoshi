I'm a huge black tea fan. I've never had a Myanmar tea, so I'm intrigued. However, the tiny size of your leaf pieces concerns me. That's more common with low-quality teas. Can you explain a bit more about this tea?

At best, this is a bunch of old ideas plus lack of specifics leading to a specific figure - that is, unfounded.

Somehow I doubt that you learned this today.

Do you mean gigabits?

One other question. I have several food allergies. Is this tea produced or processed with potential allergens like nuts?

"Bits" is the most overloaded term ever. Why do people advocate this? There has to be a better term.

This is an ideal setup in my opinion. I'd be happier, have more time for interests, and feel better physically.
... Mind putting in an app for me?

You should try better green tea, then!

On the one hand, it's cool to see Bitcoin in the news. On the other, Yahoo is the memetic trash heap of the internet.

I thought the whole point of small block sizes was that you can participate fully in the Bitcoin ecosystem even if all you have is a toaster with satellite internet in the middle of the Australian outback.

I think if you want to get people to use BTC, you need to quickly and without pressure tell them the benefits (low transaction fees, more secure). Then back off! They'll ask you if they want to learn more.
This post could generate a forum invasion sort of thing, which I think would be a bad idea.

Also, if it's so obvious that you can't be bothered to give reasons, then why post it?

I'd expect to pay $10 or so (USA) for 100g of good  quality Assam tea, perhaps more for very high quality. I really want to support this but the prices do need to come down a bit.

That's true, but we are already getting attention as an "upvote brigade". I just saw a post in get deleted because of overenthusiastic bitcoiners.

There are definitely higher-end Assams out there:

So what do you want us to do about it? I don't think posting this here is a great idea.
