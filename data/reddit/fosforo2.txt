Hi! I'd like to propose a small but great NGO I personally love. [Communities for Development] ( 
They are a great team that are making a change in a small community in Uganda supporting entrepreneurs in rural Uganda. 
I helped them to make  (please watch is really funny) [a fundraising campaign last year that got them running until now]( but money is over and now the project really need help to keep the charity running.  [Here you can find their BTC wallets](
I was lucky enough to go to Uganda for 2 weeks and I could see how the community love the volunteers and how their lives have changed in many different ways. Please PM or ask any question you may have, and I'll ask the founders of the NGO to answer every doubt. 
Thank you! 
And thank you for doing this, regardless this project gets selected or not, as this is what make the Bitcoin community so strong. No doubt btc will change the world!

PROTIP FOR A ZEN CHRISTMAS: Delete blockfolio. Then, install it after a while,  when the cryptoworld is green and happy again

It looks like you guys are happy  about what happened in Venezuela.  Bitcoin is as good as Dollars compared to Venezuela crisis. We have to argument if Bitcoin is better than Dollars.

The point is not to replace centralised money, etc..? One day I hope I use it for my everyday life.

A bank transfer to a bank is more traceable than a BTC one to a wallet. A thief would always prefer this last one. In my opinion..
