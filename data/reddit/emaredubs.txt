I just can't for the life of me figure out why people had so much of their bitcoin holdings in an online wallet on an exchange site. If you're not actively day trading bitcoin, why not keep it in a wallet on your computer?
I bought and sold a bit from Mt. Gox. As soon as I bought or sold bitcoin, I immediately transferred the money / bitcoin out of Mt. Gox and into either my bank account or personal bitcoin wallet. Thought this was common sense?

Or even if he did find the flash drive but sold all of his BTC for a total of $250. I bet that would be more frustrating, because if he never found the flash drive to this day, he could still hold out hope that it would turn up and he'd be a multimillionaire.

Yep I've had multiple non tech-savvy coworkers and family members start talking about bitcoin within the past two months. This never happened, even at the peak of the past few bubbles. I think we're nearing bubble peak and we'll see a significant correction - not just in BTC, but crypto-wide.

For sure. I didn't even hear about bitcoin as early as many people on here, but still early enough to regret not going all in at that point. I think I stumbled across bitcoin in June 2011 just as the first bubble was peaking. Afterward, when it was about $4, I decided to do some day trading and bought $100 worth, got roughly 24 bitcoin for that. Sold a little higher and cashed out for $125, happy with a $25 profit. A little less than two years later that 24 bitcoin would have been worth over $20,000. Oops

Am I the only one who thinks that at this point, bitcoin is worthless as a currency? Don't get me wrong, I've been interested in bitcoin since 2011 I appreciate its potential. But until the exchange rate stabilizes, truly stabilizes, for the long term, I can't imagine using it as a currency. Imagine if the U.S. dollar fluctuated as wildly in value from month to month - it would be unusable, budgeting would be impossible.

I don't understand all this talk about doom and gloom. The price of one single bitcoin is still nearly $500. Five hundred dollars. Until the beginning of 2013 bitcoin was hovering around $10-15. That's still an ENORMOUS jump in value in just over a year and a half. And an almost incalculable increase in value from four years ago when the price of a bitcoin was almost nothing. Perspective, people.

You're not necessarily wrong, it's just that most people on this sub are technically savvy and extremely interested in bitcoin. So to them, getting set up with bitcoin is a fairly simple process, and they downvote anyone who suggests that it's not a piece of cake. But to the billions of not-so-tech-savvy people in the world, who find simply using online banking to be difficult, they don't have the knowledge or desire to learn bitcoin exchange as it currently exists. If we really want to encourage universal adoption of bitcoin, we absolutely need to make it much simpler than it currently is to buy, sell, and convert bitcoins to other currencies.

I would say that the most significant financial innovation of the past 1,000 years, as measured by its impact on the global economy, was the decoupling of a company's stock price from the actual value of the assets that the company owned. Suddenly, the stock price could go as high as the market demanded without any concrete basis other than the fact that the market judged the asset to have that value. Of course, this innovation has had both positive and disastrous consequences to the global financial system. "We're creating wealth!"

For 99% of users, I think the goal is to turn BTC into more USD or whatever fiat currency they use. BTC is just far too volatile to make sense as a currency at this point, and you still can't do most financial transactions in BTC. You still generally need USD, for example, to pay your rent, pay your utility bills, buy gasoline, buy groceries, etc. Because the price has historically risen, and sometimes sharply during bubbles, people get involved in order to make money.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:29:29
In that respect, it's been the early days the entire time. Sure, some tiny fraction of bitcoin transactions have been related to startup bitcoin businesses and people actually using bitcoin as currency. But I would venture a guess that a huge percentage of bitcoin transactions are, and have been since the early days, pure price speculation.

Well, the West Coast sort of has it figured out, at least with respect to marijuana. And if Silk Road did nothing but allow people to buy and sell marijuana, I don't think Ross would have received a life sentence. The problem is the fear and misunderstanding that surrounds most other illegal drugs. Sure, that fear is often warranted when it comes to destructive, addictive drugs like opioids, methamphetamine, crack cocaine, etc. But that fear is not warranted for psychedelics and the like.
Really, it just comes down to a lack of education among the general public when it comes to psychoactive drugs and their relative risks and benefits. That ignorance shapes the law, and the law reinforces the ignorance. It's a vicious cycle.
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:57:17

You've got me feeling nostalgic. I actually first heard of bitcoin in mid-2011 by way of Silk Road. Someone mentioned Tor in a random reddit IAMA thread and I had never heard of it before, so I started down the rabbit hole of reading about Tor, its primary uses, Silk Road, and then bitcoin. I downloaded Tor and checked out Silk Road out of curiosity, and I remember it seeming so surreal that all of those products were being openly sold, sellers had ratings just like on Amazon, etc. It seemed like I had stepped into the future in which we transitioned from a war on drugs to a harm reduction model. And right there in the corner of the Silk Road site was the current bitcoin exchange rate. I think at the time, it was around $15 but falling pretty quickly after the first ~$30 bubble popped.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:49:59


Honestly, this current spike is 99.9% speculation. Self-reinforcing mania phase and like each bitcoin bubble before this one ($30, $250, $1,200) it'll probably eventually come crashing sharply down and then hit a brief period of stability at a new plateau of about 20-40% of the bubble peak. So assuming this bubble peaks at, say, $15K (total guess), it'll probably crash down to a low of about $1,500, then slowly rise and stabilize around $2,500-$3,500... *if* past performance is any indicator of future performance, which it might not be.
But my point is, we've seen this exact same thing happen in mid 2011, early 2013, late 2013, and now mid to late 2017. Each time the pattern and conversion surrounding bitcoin is the same, just each one is orders of magnitude larger than the last.

Nice ad hominem. That guy's identity and post history don't invalidate his comment. This sub really is like 95% shit posts whoring for karma, including yours here. It's all MOON! HODL! MOON! HODL!

I bought $100 worth of bitcoin around that time in 2011. IIRC it was about 24.5 BTC. I held for a week and sold all of them for $125. At the time I thought a $25 profit for doing basically nothing was pretty cool. At least I didn't lose money!

So much of this sub nowadays is material.

I bought $100 worth of BTC in late 2011 when it was ~$4.XX, I think my total haul was about 24.5 BTC. I then sold all of them a few weeks later when the price climbed up to $6.XX. That $100 would now be worth over $130K. Whoops!

Yeah probably somewhere at or around the first $30 bubble peak.

It's not even an investment, it's a gamble. The value of bitcoin is underpinned by nothing but the fact that other people believe it's worth something - not unlike the fiat currency people in this sub love to criticize. Putting money into bitcoin is like putting money into gold, but with much more risk and WAY more volatility.

Cue the "this is actually good news" comments

I agree, it used to be very simple back in the day. Bank account - Dwolla or PayPal - Bitcoin Exchange. Could all be done online in a matter of minutes. Those were also the days when $100 would buy you like 50 BTC

What, you don't try to open a bank account in every country you visit?

I used to have a desktop widget with the bitcoin price and I remember it being stable around $15 for about a year. And that seemed expensive after I was buying and selling it around $4-$5.

Or just have someone in control of the budget to ensure that overspend doesn't occur? It just strikes me as a bad idea to lock up money so that you can't even access it in case of an emergency.

An exchange "losing" millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin is like a monthly occurrence. Smh at anyone who leaves any amount of bitcoin on an exchange site for more than the few minutes necessary between buying/selling.
@_date: 2015-10-23 16:21:40
But if you're not earning interest, what would be the point of locking down access to your bitcoin for a set length of time? That's like a 0.00% CD, seems ridiculous.

I hope that is independently wealthy from BTC... if not, he dun goofed.

Stage 1 of bitcoin was when the value increased exponentially so that simply mining/buying bitcoin and waiting was enough to make enormous returns. 
Now that the price has begun to somewhat level off, we've entered stage 2 of bitcoin, wherein the only way to quickly make an enormous profit is to start an exchange and then get "hacked", thereby "losing" a large chunk of your customers' deposits.

Is this a suicide note? Sure sounds like one.

This takes me back. I first heard of bitcoin in June 2011 just as the first major bubble was peaking. I bought $100 worth of bitcoin circa November 2011, which at the time was about 24.5 BTC. Sold all of them a few weeks later for a tidy $20 profit. Those BTC would be worth about $65K today. Oops!
At least I still have 1 BTC via my Casascius physical bitcoin. It's even a first edition with the hologram typo, wonder if it's worth anything more than 1 BTC?

Man finds 4 year old bitcoin article, reposts on reddit, finds it's now worth 1667+ karma
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:04:34
Just like the post title, my 'now worth' statement is way outdated
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:34:52
Any idea where I could get it graded and encapsulated? I've just had it sitting in a ziploc bag in a drawer for the last 5+ years. Additionally would encapsulation make it harder to prove the coin's authenticity? I think the private key is located under the holographic sticker on the back of the coin, which I've left in place since I bought it.

Spot on. Prevailing sentiment like this is the reason I've gradually spent less and less time on reddit.

Why is BitInstant necessary when using Dwolla? Can't I just transfer money directly from my Dwolla account to Mt. Gox? Last time I bought bitcoins (December 2011) I simply added money to my Dwolla account from my checking account, then sent it to my Mt. Gox account.
