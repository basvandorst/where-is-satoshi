Investors are not loyal to a specific instrument, they are loyal to strategy, profits and preservation of capital. Most investors will not give 2 craps whether they invest in BTC or BCH as long as it's a good investment.

But I do think we can see 6800-7200 (or even higher) before the Segwit 2x date before coming down.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:31:49
I think $5000-$4500. See my video:

Hmm, I think $5k is first before $10k

I'm pretty sure there are already strippers and hookers accepting bitcoin as a form of payment

while that is true, it could hit 4000 or 3000 before it hits 6000, so your trying to be smart or witty in this case, is flawed :)

Epic tale indeed.
Always take good care of your seed and pin!

Negative RSI divergence forming which is dangerous, but there is possibility for an exhaustion move to 6800/7000 before segwit 2x imo

Negative RSI divergence is forming, but there is possiblity for an exhaustion to the upside targeting 6800-7000 before Segwit 2x.
If we can't break out to the upside soon then I fear $5000 is the next target.

I think we could see a push to 5800/6000 before the fork on the 25th of October

Largest amount is actually in BTC although I think it will probably make the lowest returns out of all the coins. 
What do you guys think?

Totally not true, loads of people own gold in some form or another. And there are way more people who own gold for investing purposes than Bitcoin (at present at least, that will probably change in future).

I can see that happening in 2018

Would love to hear the communities thoughts on BCC vs BTC. BCC is pretty cheap right now at $330 if it's true we could see 2-3k BCC.
