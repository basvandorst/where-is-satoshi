He didn't lay out any sort of argument.
He just complains with no action suggestion.

You don't have massacres but you are also subjects not citizens. Funny about that.
You also just had a mass shooting where no law-abiding citizen could protect themselves. The only option is to flee.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:34:02
He isn't a dickhead. It is the same exact liberty principle. 
Without the right to defend yourself you are a subject, not a citizen.
Everytime the government wants to do something you should ask yourself "Does this make me more free or less free?"
Forcing everyone in the country to bring in their guns for collection objectively makes you less free.
Sure you get the benefit on potentially evil people having less access, but you greatly slide yourself toward the Subject end of the scale between Citizen and Subject.
You now need to hope that an evil person with a firearm never wants to do you harm. You now need to hope that your government never turns toward tryanny.
They would never do that though right? I mean it isn't like they want to track how much you are spending. Oh wait.......
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:55:05
Eliminate all cash purchase and now every single dollar is traceable. 
It is one of the advantages of cryptocurrency the traceability. It is only an advantage though with crypto because the wallets remain anonymous from the users indentity. 
It is entirely possible that a fully digital monetary system is traceable

"But even when you do you will need to prove that you did everything you could before getting your gun and defending yourself."
That doesn't sound like you are a subject and not a citizen at all /s
Here is more credible argument from my other post:
Without the right to defend yourself you are a subject, not a citizen.
Everytime the government wants to do something you should ask yourself "Does this make me more free or less free?"

Could you launder money if all purchases were tracked?
They want to track all of your purchases and this is just a step toward that.

@_date: 2018-05-14 19:32:20
Try to have a massive gun buy back in the USA and let me know how that goes. 
The point is not to go toe to toe with a governments armed forces.
The point is to have the ability to defend yourself. 
They could make the United States "gun free" but the collection attempt would result in massive bloodshed. That in itself it a deterrent against tyranny. 
The 2nd ammendment guarantees that if the government were to tred too heavily on indivudal freedoms and there will be massive problems.

It isn't necessarily good for Bitcoin; however, it demonstrates cryptocurrency's inherient good.
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:12:31
It isn't tinfoil hat.
I would bet you almost anything you like that 30 years from now there are no cash purchases anymore at all.
Agreed that Bitcoin is less anaymous than cash. They need to make improvements to anonimity. That said there is no reason why it can't markedly improve.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:27:33
You are a fucking idiot that doesn't understand that this is simply a step toward tracking all purchases. 
The point of the law is NOT efficiency. The point of the law is to track large purchases and as a result limit individual liberty.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:22:57
I know how to buy it I just don't really want to toss money in coinbase and let it sit.
I have never actually done a transaction though so the specifics of how to move from Electrum to Ledger are a little confusion. 
I'll probably play with it and just move a small amount around a bunch before I commit to the whole coin

@_date: 2017-11-21 17:07:47
Yeah i don’t get the need for vitriol, i gave him a pretty clear response now. 
I don’t know why anyone would thing that a coin being used as the protocol for an entire machine economy would have no affect on the value.
It would be worth like 10,000x in that dream scenario 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:33:31
Lol yeah my bad
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:55:10
I am not an expert, but I don't believe so.
At this point my understanding is that the coordinator only exists to add security until the network is large enough that it couldn't be toppled by an attack.
In typing that, I imagine that the coordinator is helping in that regard currently.
I am pretty active in monitoring their development slack and the consensus is that we are approaching the point where the coordinator will not be needed.
That said, I again am mostly a layman when it comes to the actual technology.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:22:15
The wallet sucks. New wallet in December. 
By “issues with the wallet” it sometimes shows a 0 balance and you have to hit refresh which causes people to panic. That said, no one is losing any money. The wallet is totally secure. 
It does suck though. The UI is terrible.
The new wallet looks really good. You can do all sorts of cool things with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:36:22
You haven’t because you know  nothing about how the transactions happen.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:04:23
- It isn’t centralized. There is an IOTA Foundation but it is not a centralized company. 
- If IOTA becomes the protocol of the Machine Economy, that will be MAJORLY good for the price. For machines to do business with one and other, they need to have a currency. If IOTA becomes that currency the value will increase. 
- Bosch is a MAJOR company that is at the forefront of applying driverless car tech. If they use IOTA as the protocol for their driverless cars (which would span across multiple brands) that leads to adoption. Snowball adoption and you have IOTA being the monetary system of the machine economy 
Obviously that is a lot of steps, but IOTA is much further along in that than anyone being as they are the ONLY non-blockchain coin right now. 
There is no point in buying anything other than BTC or IOTA imho because you are “ truly diversifying by getting off the block chain with IOTA. 
Anything else you buy is just trying to copy BTC with variation on speed and privacy. All of those coins will have scale issues later anyways.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:16:29
No problem
I am by no means an expert. I really think that IOTA has substantial promise.
BTC is always going to be the gold standard imho, but there are some things it just can't do.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:30:56
I was mixing it up.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:16:22
I like that banks seem to be interested in XMR. But i still don’t think it does much that you can’t do with BTC.
What do you specifically prefer about it?
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:47:15
Nothing is guaranteed obviously.
That said IOTA has contracts with Bosch (the German auto manufacturer) as well as other companies to be the protocol behind their IOT tech in driverless cars.
IOTA is one of he few coins that has real world implementation like that.
The machine economy IS coming. 
I love BTC and think it will continue to be the digital gold of the future, but it simply isnt equipped to be the basis of a machine economy. At least not currently.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:20:00
I brought up Bosch 1 time. You asked me to expound twice. 
I think it has tons of utility with or without corporate contracts, but the fact they have them is a hugely good thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:16:20
Yeah it is because it has gone up substantially 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:43:44
When the turnoff the central node he price will go bonkers high. 
I’ll take the risk and be in well before then.
The price has already run from .30s to .90s in a matter of two months.
The December roll out i really think will push it possibly ally he way to $2
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:52:20
You could be right regarding IoT.
Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:05:50
This answers your question regarding the total number of IOTA relative to some other crypto. All IOTA that will exist already exists.
As far as the price being over or undervalued, that is in the eye of the beholder. The relative value of IOTA to ripple or BTC seems to lead me to believe it is substantially undervalued.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:02:38
They are open source. 
It is only speculation that it could be attacked. I just haven’t seen a concrete rationale. 
It i suppose is a red flag, but being as an attack has never occurred it doesn’t bother me. BTC could be 51% attacked yet i don’t consider that a flag
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:18:42
The double spend is talked about at length by the developers.
I guess i would say that there has never been a successful double spend on the network. However, some theorize that it could happen,l. The developers are adamant that it can’t but really won’t share the math on why. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:59:44
To each his own. Once the coordinator is off it is entirely decentralized and fee-less forever.
The completely fee-less nature is what I love about it. We don't have to worry about forks and the like because there are no miners to control the future of the coin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:15:31
IOTA has scarcity. It has only a few million more IOTA than Satoshi. 
It is on what they call the tangle 
The tangle is faster and more secure than a block chain. Plus it has the added bonus that the transactions are free. Which is something you need to have in a machine economy.
That said, the tangle is still growing and less tested than BTC. As time goes on with no successful breach, i will start to trust it more. 
You can read the white paper on IOTA. But all of your peer to peer transactions will happen into perpetuity. Currently there is a coordinator, but the reliance on that is rapidly going away.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:41:34
I would suggest r/Iota or r/iotamarkets for their how to guides.
They are really great communities.
If you are American, you can’t buy IOTA with USD currently. You will be able to soon. I really think we will see the price jump with more US exchange adoption.
Right now the best way for an American to buy would be to buy Ether on coinbase and then open a Binance account. Transfer the Ether to Binance and then buy IOTA using the Ether.
Like anything, you need to do your own research, but i am
a strong believer in IOTA.
They work on what the call “the tangle” as opposed to the blockchain it gets faster with more users as opposed to slower. There are lots of good videos on why iota is better 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:28:30
It is the only coin that isn’t blockchain.
IOTA aspires to THE protocol of the Internet of Things next gen Internet. They already have contracts with major corporations to be the basis of their IOT
In my opinion you have BTC, ETH, and IOTA. Everything else is a copy coin or a shit coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:15:58
I’d look at r/iota or r/iotamarkets
Basically just buy BTC or ETH on coinbase or your preferred exchange.
Then transfer those coins to Binance and buy your iota 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:58:20
Neo to me is a copy coin. I’d rather just buy BTC.
If i am going to diversify my crypto portfolio, i figure to get into something not blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:14:41
Only you can make that decision, but i would say it is worth investing what you can afford to lose.
There is a lot of positive factors that will continue to push the price well beyond $10,000 in my opinion
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:56:47
You can. You just need to use crypto to buy.
I think BTC and IOTA are the best cryptospace investments right now.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:02:25
This is extremely well put.
You said more in 1 post than and have in roughly 10 on this thread.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:26:08
Ok then don’t bitch and don’t talk to me anymore if you don’t care to learn anything about it.
The video i linked explains how a has is validated. The coordinator has NOTHING to do with processing for free. NOTHING. With the coordinator off the transactions are ALL still FREE FOREVER. Transactions are validated locally by the devices requesting the transfer (ie your smartphone)
You are just an ignorant ass in that you are going to tell me to “strongly consider” the long term potential of IOTA when you factually don’t know shit about it and aren’t even willing to look. 
Toss all your money into BTC. Be my guest. It is a fantastic  store of value. You will do quite well.
Factually, there are other economic problems in the world, like the Machine Economy, that BTC CANNOT address. The comment thread was about what other coins might have value. I think i have done good enough service of answering your questions, but you don’t care to actually learn anything. 
Good luck to you.

The future of bitcoin is pretty binary. 
You could be right. It could go straight to 0.
You also could be very very wrong and miss out on wildly high returns.
Despite the fact this is an echo chamber, I would be a lot more inclined to respect your opinion if you provided any insight as to why you have this position. However, your post history indicates all you do is FUD. 
"It's a pyramid scheme" isn't even close to a valid critique. So please contribute something meaningful or up your troll game or gtfo

I mean it has a little to do with bitcoin.
Their GPUs are primarily for gamers, but lots of people buy them for mining any type of crypto. 
They don't have cards branded for mining. 
Regardless, you are right in your assessment that no one over there knows what they are talking about in regards to BTC.
This is all further proof that we are all still very very early investors.

@_date: 2018-02-25 22:01:23
Only caring about bitcoin (regardless of if this is the Bitcoin sub or not) demonstrates that you are very ignorant of the future of this technology.
Bitcoin is great don't get me wrong. It might end up being the most dominate protocol, but over the past year it's dominance has done nothing but fall.
Even if you are a Bitcoin Zealot you should be wildly interested in the other protocols and the threat they pose.
Or just be an ignorant zealot. Your choice.

This is inherently false. Anyone reading you can now see that you are nothing more than FUD and have no understanding  of currency be it fiat or crypto.


1. If it is a "scheme" who is the beneficiary of it. It is decentralized. Is Satochi the "schemer"? 
2. Define late. As has been stated logically thousands of times, the future of crypto is binary. It either will go to absolute 0 or it will moon. We are at less than 1% adoption currently, but are seeing exponential growth and consistently greater mainstream coverage. The price of BTC will have to conservatively be near $100,000 if it take even a fraction of a percentage of all transactions. Literally everyone who owns BTC now is in at the ground floor. Even if you bought at 4,900 you are wildly early for what BTC is: A deflationary decentralized asset with a binary future.
In the future you should try harder with your FUD. Using words like "pyramid scheme" but not explaining how it applies to BTC just makes you look childish.

I HATE when people say that bitcoin is all speculative. There is millions of dollars in mining infrastructure supporting it as well as its objective value of moving money safely and relatively quickly.

Did you buy to make quick fiat profit?
If so then yes, bad move.
If you bought to have a long term return you have lost very little.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:11:06
When the Segwit 2x occurs later this month, the BTC Ledger will be copied. This copy is called a “fork”
Everyone who owns BTC will own the same amount in BTC Segwit 2x.
This fork is occurring because BTC transfer times are slow, so mining companies are trying to release a faster version of bitcoin.
People are buying BTC now so they will have more when the fork occurs.
No one knows what will happen, but in all likelihood the “new” bitcoins won’t have much value and will quickly crash (see bitcoin cash). Nonetheless people want to vulture as much value as they can from them buy building their BTC balance to get more before the fork.
What is happening today: BTC price is soaring because people want more BTC before the fork. Alt coins are falling because people are selling to free up funds to buy BTC.
After the fork, there will be a pull back as people  cash out profits. You will see BTC Segwit2x coins die quickly and Alt coins recover.
Now is a good time to Buy BTC (it’s almost always a good time to long BTC) and it is also a good time to buy your favorite falling alt coin (imho) I REALLY like IOTA
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:54:54
Don’t get me wrong I love Bitcoin, but some other coins do show promise.
IOTA for example is VERY different and solves almost all the problems that Bitcoin has. 
That said, Bitcoin has the momentum.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:52:32
I pretty much agree with you, but I believe that it could take many years for this to happen.
BTC is having lots of trouble scaling - this is happening currently,  not just at the moon levels where we all want to go. Bitcoin isn’t really good at anything other than being a store of value. It doesn’t have scalability, speed, smart contracts ect on its side.
This is why I really believe in IOTA which gets faster wit more users, not slower.
That said, I am a big believer that BTC will continue to grow for a substantial amount of time. To MANY people bitcoin and crypto are synonymous and they don’t understand it. We are in the “what is this email thing” stage of crypto. 
Over the years there are going to be lots of winners and losers in this space. Bitcoin is certainly going to be a winner for quite sometime. Maybe even 10+ years, but it will not be the largest market cap global takeover crypto currency once crypto overcomes fiat
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:32:03
I think BTC is mainly a store of value. The fees and transaction times are hard to overcome. 
That said, I totally believe in BTC increasing in value.
As far as a currency option, I believe that we could see something like IOTA start to grow.
