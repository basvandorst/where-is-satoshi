Hey Jimmy, thanks for taking time to write up here.
A request, don't please convert BTC to fiat. Just keep the address for accepting bitcoin donation for a few days and see where it goes. It will help you and us also by getting some good press since we have been goxed and doxed lately. It hurts when people cash out immediately. This is the start of new era and kindly try and be with Bitcoin.

Do you plan to integrate other popular cryptos such as LTC and Doge in future? Is there a possibility?

Are you kidding me. The world population is about 7.5 billion.

What if gox has already decided not to come back. The price is being pumped so people will run to buy, once people line up, they will sell what they bought at around 100 , make profit and leave...
Just another theory

Well, lets think about youtube videos or other informational videos or articles, the author who is publishing things out there would really appreciate the micro donations or tips. Also on a personal note, i would rather tip someone on youtube than paying a flat monthly service to some  corp. Please don't forget , there are more struggling talented people who post things that are useful on the internet and the internet currency like Bitcoin or other altcoin can help significant amount of people.
Tell me one thing, have you never been moved or feel helped by a video that you saw for free on the internet? How awesome would it be to give out a few cents/dollars to those folks?
