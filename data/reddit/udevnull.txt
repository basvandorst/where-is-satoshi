Glad to hear that. Bitcoin is experiencing quite a lot of welcomed growth, but with it, we are facing some challenges on how to best scale. We've got some solutions on the table but we have yet to come to an agreement on the way forward. These kind of issues will be solved as Bitcoin grows but as 'early adopters', we need to accept that these things will happen from time to time.

If you're in a hurry, you can always pay more fees. I'm not saying that that is right or wrong but I'm saying that it's a method to deal with the current situation that we find ourselves in.
Also, 2 weeks is a bit excessive, maybe like 2/3 days max.

It means, it'll be mined anything from 3 blocks after the submission until it expires (
If the transaction never gets mined, you'll "get" all your money back so to speak because that transaction "never happened".

This is not a scaling solution. This is an alt coin that does not follow the consensus algorithm of Bitcoin. It fundementally introduces centralisation, increases the cost of running a node to the point where the only people who can run nodes are bigger companies.
Not to mention those bugs which Greg Maxwell alluded to which, by his own words, are much worse than the DDOS attack BU faced.

this, the overall cost of eventually paying in Bitcoin if you don't already have Bitcoin is higher than just taking out your credit card and paying.

Nah, at this point we're fighting what is basically a fashion movement for them. As Gavin Mcinnes describes the movement on the left in the US.
Most arguments coming from Core/small blocks are from a technical basis whereas most of the argument from their side can be broken down to: "YOU'RE A CORE SUPPORTER, THEREFORE I AM AGAINST YOU". Without actually critically assessing the risk or what they stand for. Which is why there is no end game for them unless they 100% take over.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:37:47
Keep in mind though that there are a lot 'firsts' here for mankind. We've never seen something like Bitcoin before. We've never seen a trustless, decentralized system working on this scale, we've never had to work on such a vital system and find consensus on how to do this on a global scale which involves: Freedom of expression &amp; Peer to Peer, trustless value exchange.
(Aside from Linux, but that is being run very differently).
So it's understandable that we are still finding our feet, even with regards to how we tackle issues that we are clearly very divided on. This does not only set up the ground work for how human conflict will be resolved within the code but also how human conflict will be resolved in general in Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies.
It's a very complex topic from all aspects.

 - BU isn't production ready, we've seen this with the last two critical bugs which brought the BU network down
 - BU devs haven't responded to those issues in the most appropriate manner, leaving a lot of people skeptical.
 - BU takes a truly decentralised system and puts a group of people (who are only in it for the money) in charge
 - BU has the abilty to further centralise the system by slowly mining blocks bigger and bigger without compensation to nodes. Meaning, miners can force nodes off the network over time in a passive way. This means that an external actor such as the Bank of China or the US can intervene here and subsidise nodes for running bigger blocks. Creating a scenerio in which nodes are now at the whim of this external actor.
 - BU doesn't think that killing the deflationary property of Bitcoin is a bad idea (removing the 21M BTC cap). Basically, it's no longer digital gold and we've gone down the same path as fiat currencies in the 60's.
**Both sides are NOT sound.** We are not just throwing around opinions here. We are genuinely concerned for the health of this network. We have a really cool, albeit sometimes difficult to understand, solution to our scaling issue ready to go. If we can just get over this BU hurdle.

That's terrible! You should not leave your Bitcoin on an Exchange unless you're actively trading them and are willing to lose them. If you don't hold the private keys to the coins, they don't belong to you.
Coinbase has a proven history of trying to break Bitcoin to suit the personal needs of their CEO. Their CEO hates Bitcoin but keeps making money because of it, so they keep it around on their platform.

Yeah, the pattern is clear. Jihan has created a business model around Bitcoin which is clearly putting himself at an advantage (backed by government, i.e. patents) while holding those who have purchased Antminers at gunpoint to follow him or suffer "technical difficulties".
Also, he has created a scenario where he benefits financially by preventing certain improvements to the Bitcoin protocol.
And yes, the pattern is very clear, the core team has some very skilled people who are looking into things which, for them, make no logical sense.
Yeah, the problem with the argument that "If you don't want then don't buy", is the fact that many have already bought.
If there is a backdoor, anyone can exploit it and it doesn't need to be Jihan. Which makes proving that he did anything very difficult. If he even did anything and the Antminers go down like BU nodes.

Andreas isn't interested in such trivial debates. He's more interested about getting Bitcoin flying and to the moon. He's a geek (a good one) and doesn't care about the politics within.
So I don't think this debate would be fruitful nor in the interest of Andreas. Which I think is right.
Also, the only thing I see from Roger are high pitched rehashes of the same sentences. So it's kinda pointless even for him to debate a recording of someone else.
**Edit:** Also, none of these debates help solve any technical issues.
@_date: 2017-04-27 05:08:10
Your post in itself is FUD.
Also:  - the code which proves the claim.
You're right, none of this has to do with Core vs BU and literally nobody should be saying that. In actual fact, I've seen comments from both camps saying things along the lines of "If anything, this should unite us". This is a problem for Bitcoin. Even for the BU guys.
So stop trying to blame core. The problem exists, now we need to deal with it.
@_date: 2017-04-27 04:47:26
An Antminer is not a person. It doesn't matter who discovered this problem. The fact that it exists is the problem.
We should be discussing how to move forward in light of this, rather than playing stupid blame games like you're doing.
Ironically, core attacked an idea here and you attacked the people who contribute to core.
@_date: 2017-04-27 06:10:23


Obviously not, but that doesn't mean the possbility doesn't exist.


This is such a tired debate, you can do your own reading about why just increasing block size is a problem. I don't need to rehash every argument that has been presented to the BU camp.
Cool, so it's not a problem that Jihan is doing all of this because the people who found it are people you don't like?
@_date: 2017-04-27 04:35:48
what does core have to do with this?

@_date: 2017-07-25 12:51:19
Bitcoin ABC is most likely a bargaining chip/threat used to "ensure" the 2X part of the segwit2x agreement. Jihan must know that it is impossible to actually force people to run btc1 and is therefore using this as a threat.
In order for it to be a viable threat, he needs to take this quite far (get it listed on exchanges etc). So my personal speculation is that the devs don't actually care about the code/project because it's not intended to actually be run for anything, unless the segwit2x falls flat.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:16:37


I assume that this is partially the idea behind the thread.
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:37:43
They're most likely running core and just signalling BU.

Don't let them into your country.
The UK's troops were in the Middle East for at least a decade and then they let a lot the people from those countries in. Why? I mean surely it's a perfect opportunity for ISIS/AL Queda/ISIL/IS/WhateverThey'reCalledNow to slip in some/a lot of their current/ex soldiers as refugees.
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:46:37
I like how they single out a crypto currency for positive news and then brandish crypto entirely for 1 exchange's flash crash on ETH.
This is obviously based purely on the headlines.
