Thank you!
I'll definitely check Netagio and Trasferwise!

Good job! Are you planning on continuing development with Swift language?

Don't know about cheaper, but yeah, probably faster than Kraken.
If I'm not mistaken they do charge a £5 fee for withdrawals (Kraken's SEPA are free). Also trade fees for Kraken are at 0.2% against the 0.35%-0.55% for Coinfloor.

Can't the BTC Spender get in trouble because they received an item bought with a stolen credit card?

Oh man, I want that House Blockchain poster! Where can I get it?

I'm studying in Edinburgh.
Not a very active BTC environment from what I saw on Localbitcoin and Coinmap, unfortunately. Will definitely think about starting a Cryptocurrency society though.

That'd be awesome! GoT and bitcoins are basically the essence of my nerdiness. Thanks!

That's exactly how you get goxed

How much is there in it?

I thought Urbandictionary would have an accurate definition for *"gox"*.

Never heard of it, but it looks very interesting. I'll have to change my mind on what I said about cryptocurrency in Scotland, thanks!

If that is the effect of an article on Time Magazine's website, everyone now believes that [Bitcoin is a company](

I looked into Barclay's foreign currency account, but apparently I need a Barclays sterling account as well before I can open one. Also I don't know if it would be that convenience for purchases in GBP through a credit card, might get extra conversion fees\horrible rates.

Lots of domains on Namecheap!

I am not eligible for a student account as I'm a non-UK student, unfortunately, though most banks will let me open a regular account. Looking online I found that [Natwest]( and [RBS]( both have an option for International student bank accounts.
It doesn't exactly have the same benefits as normal student accounts, but I think I do get a small overdraft of £10 and a free tastecard (yay!).
As most of you said though, I'd just have to pick one as they're as bad as each other.

Wow! Thanks for doing this!
