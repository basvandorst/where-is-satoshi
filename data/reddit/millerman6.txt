*" He did so in the programming language PHP, which is a dangerously unsafe language"*
Seriously? This author doesn't know what he's talking about.

Seems kinda weird that the streamers have to enable to option themselves.

Sure, you might be running 81 servers but they aren't dedicated like the ones mtgox were/are running.
I imagine downtime would be due to poor practices (database running on the same box as the web server, direct code deployment to production etc) rather than the sheer amount of servers.

This 'bubble'? More like this bull run. We've barely started.

"It's too late to invest in bitcoin"
How many times have I heard that? People were saying it after bitcoin rose to $266 and dropped to $50, and they'll say it again for years to come while the price continues to rise.

Don't pay too much attention to the chat.. It's called the trollbox for a reason.

This is awesome! I happen to live in wellington as well (specifically, further north) but I don't see much point in coming in to town for a bottle of Pepsi. Neat idea though.

Thank you!

It just sounded from your post that you only attempted contact with them in the past day. They're a big site with a small amount of staff, I'd imagine they may take a few days to respond.
You'd be better off asking if anybody else is having issues instead of assuming they're stealing your deposits.

What did you use to purchase in NZ? I'm weary of using localbitcoins because the rates are so high.
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:09:56
I assume the shipping is US only?
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:09:01
That's correct, see my comment above.
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:02:08
Awesome, great to hear your opinions. I'll keep this in mind!

Bitcoins are definitely not infinitely divisible. They're only divisible to 8 decimal places, aka 0.00000001 or a 'satoshi'.
Basically there will never be more than 2,099,999,997,690,000 (~2 quadrillion) satoshis.

That kind of behavior with the deposit address is normal - this might sound stupid, but are you using the right BTC-e account?
The whole process at BTC-e is automated, and this isn't a widespread issue. There's no point throwing accusations around on reddit, I'd wait at least another few days for a response.

BUT JUST LOOK AT ALL THE SUCCESS!

The fees won't drop to zero, as nobody would want to process your transaction. If you want to use bitcoins it's necessary to pay transaction fees. As I understand it, the amount of transactions in each block will increase as the popularity of bitcoin rises (meaning more rewards for miners, or auditors as they might be called)

MtGox changed their API URL, meaning the application needs to be updated in order to work properly. A ton of other applications broke as well.
