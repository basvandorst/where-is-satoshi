Yes. Have a drawer full of Japanese legal papers and no bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:10:41
Not all....not me
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:14
Really? I spend most of the time worrying that it will all crash back to 600 :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:43:12

Ghash/ CEx are down too... 
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:42:03
Used it for 6 months and no probs. Can get expensive as you need to convert to Lindens first, and they take a cut each time.

Who feels a petition coming on?

Second language speaker is my guess: he think he means a lot more than a pinch
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:10:05
Thank you Sir. A bit of 80s humour wasted on the kids there ;0
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:30:48
Been working hard for them. Have you contacted them?
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:37:51
Yep, that is the symbol for baht. Bitcoin prob needs a new one. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:31:21
What's the geek injoke? Is this some mathematically pleasing figure?  
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:46:01
Well yes, that's pretty much the size of it. I can't begin to imagine how good a blog would have to be to make me reach for a credit card, enter details, etc. Tipping is an impulsive thing, a gesture from the heart. It needs to be quick. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:18:05
You could (just)make a TV ad for that much. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:46:19
THere was an advance notification on Ghash about an hour ago: supposed to be up in an hour i think 
@_date: 2014-01-27 13:49:46
Saw this a while ago 
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:09:35
Fine guys, but WHEN will it be fixed? Thanks for the update @_date: 2014-01-02 01:04:36
Hey so I sent you a friend request :) Good idea, I will do the same. Just to expand on the idea, maybe "to play with" is not the best wording as it implies just trading.
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:06:54
Having the same problem and not a peep out of them. Soon as I get my money they can do one for good.
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:50:57
Did you hear anything? They have not opened my response after thre days
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:36:40
Ah, ok I see now. Random. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:39:59
It was on the Telegraph so a good chance it's true. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:25:51
But exactly what i was thinking. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:14:22
Yep, still nothing despite the above claiming that TX should be fixed now. Shocking

I have 1.1 BTC stuck six days
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:32:57
Cool. how about sharing the presentation? 
@_date: 2014-02-02 10:06:22
Just trawling reddit and bitcoin talk  
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:37:57
That would be stupid IMO, we need to minimise panic until the picture is clearer.  
@_date: 2014-01-03 12:32:42
Interesting angle, but how can you not do all of the above with fiat? Are you expecting that the deflationary nature of BTC will help? 
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:57:44
Maybe, but why will they not respond? Shady
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:57:17
Me too. When i use this tool 
I get this message:
OS = Outpoints already spent - Some of the outpoints have already been spent meaning this transaction is invalid. MtGox will double spend this transaction and re-issue (Bug) ETA 24-48 hours.
@_date: 2014-02-01 13:00:46
me too :( Like talking to a wall
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:00:29
That works. It's just an evangelising idea. Put it in your own words if you like it. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:12:14
FINALLY, signs of life (although not bitcoin). Just had this. 
Brendan Support, Feb 05 01:12:

NOte that the TX he points to was never a problem, it's the nogger older one that's stuck... 
@_date: 2014-01-18 20:04:09
Can someone else please sit through it for me. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 18:21:16
Good news. Did they ever reply to your email or did BTC just appear?
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:16:11
I have just deleted my paypal account. Had to happen anyway. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:41:34
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:29:58
What if the cryotank was run by a bitcoin agent  that paid rent and electricity with BTC? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:34:13
Self fulfilling prophecy. People anticipating fallout from Gox incompetence selling, thus causing fallout. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:31:32
It never ceases to bemuse me why people like yourself hang out in this subreddit. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:29:18
Well I stand corrected. Every day's a school day
@_date: 2014-01-04 12:19:42
British humour for you, intended to parody expectations. author playing up to posho stereotype.
@_date: 2014-01-01 17:24:34
Sorry to hear that. Let us know what they say. FYI they sent me a free Yubi and it works great.
@_date: 2014-02-01 13:01:17
Three days for 1 BTC
@_date: 2014-02-01 13:20:24
Can you tell us what the message said? I dream of useless messages now
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:38:14
Hey, a guy earned it if so! How long did that shit take?
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:53:39
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:59:55
Man dropping coins like it's nothing 
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:45:06
nailed it
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:38:18
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:01:20
Very good though, I hasten to add. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:31:06
Yeah, my research likewise suggests that we are in the minority. It's just the lack of contact that worries me. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:21:51
He's just being droll 
@_date: 2014-01-05 14:54:45
I have had no problems at all with them. Careful with that word, you'll need it. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:01:02
For any non English peeps reading, some context. *The Spectator* is just about the dustiest, most right wing, upper classiest old rag you can imagine, so I see this as sign of how far the bitcoin fever has spread.
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:39:31
They told me point blank today that their BTC are not fractional
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:24:07
Just wait, they will eventually get to you
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:39:49
Yeah, write their press release for them, why don't you :) 
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:51:52
So who is Ryan Galt then?
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:39:01

@_date: 2014-01-04 19:51:41
I heard americans don't even have passports mostly. And I once met an American who asked if you could drive to Germany from the US. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 18:15:49
Ah the old beanie babies comparison. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 09:58:11
Ah, was all set to pay before i realised only US. It can wait. Great site. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 10:40:33
Cheers. Your panic withdraw has made it even less likely the rest of us will get ours :)
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:50:33
Wonderful! A heart warming bitcoin tale and I will sleep easier tonight. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:09:43
Yep, same shit happened to me last night. Cousin is a geek and should know better. I find, as ever simple sound bites are effective. Just tell 'em how much your outlay has increased (BTC is so much more, but we're talking their language here). 
Security? To hack bitcoin, plug a quantum computer into an exploding star. (can't now find this excellent post on reddit) 
Why? Because you get to be your own bank. 
Many very clever people have worked very long and hard to make bitcoin. You can't dismiss it in five minutes.
Yeah, there were loads of people who didn't get the internet when i was at uni. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 08:05:24
Just had this: 
We can see that your withdrawal is yet to be processed. The transactions are being re-issued automatically.All BTC are safe ,the transaction will be processed and they are not lost or stolen.We are working to resolve the issue, but at this point we are unable to give a definite date of resolution.Please be advised that BTC on MtGox are not fractional.
We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused and Thank you for your patience.
Best regards,
MtGox Team

That’s funny, the clunky art direction and bad copy made me think great, they don’t waste money on an agency. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:36:35
Quantum spin is a thing right?
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:00:41
Diversifying against the coming property crash, smart.

@_date: 2013-12-30 17:06:29
Nice! One day we'll score big with bitcoin ... 
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:24:42
Well put, I hadn't thought of it like that. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:55:48
Good point
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:10:51

@_date: 2013-12-30 19:50:15
That's weird. I wonder what the rule is? No living animals are proper nouns, except perhaps when the species is being referred to i.e the Horse. A wiki search reveals that *Dodo* seems to be capitalised, though *moa* is not. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:20:22
:) Bookmark The Oatmeal, for he brings much joy. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:57:54
Pounds and dollars aren't capitalised in normal usage though, unless in full i.e. US Dollar. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:42:42
Silly internet people being idiots
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:32:34
Awesome idea, i might nick that. My ad however would say "Please note, you must be up for a laugh and fully into it; if you feel anyway demeaned by the caper it'll kill the vibe and make me feel like a dick."
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:41:32
Server space for starters
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:32:34
It's an all round win. One thing that puzzles me, the whole of Britain is fuming about the banks, wondering how to stick it to them, and here we stand with the flaming sword that will drive them from the garden, hesitating. Edit: typo.

Smart guy, I look forward to applying for a job under him one day. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:53:05
That's not ad hominem, just a little chippy. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:52:06
maybe because i mentioned bust...
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:52:13
Fair enough. Usage wise though, I note that Bitcoin is only capitalised when referring to the network, not the unit. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:56:23
So when you mention dollars in a sentence, meaning US dollars, you capitalise it?
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:47:04
Woah, you just spilled the guy's production secret. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:55:36
Because they got greedy and starting pricing castles and sportscars. Or was that just me?
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:28:40
Someone care to explain?
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:20:54
Why is this rising so slowly? Upvote so more people comment on the Freakonomics blog: it's just the kind of site to bring bitcoin to the masses. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 01:54:01
Or if you have any imagination, or if once you didn't know everything.

@_date: 2013-12-20 11:22:06
What would we moan about then?
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:40:54
Very interesting 
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:47:28
The amount is regulated by production (supply) and by demand. Big question and I am probably not the wannabe geek to answer it but this is what I know, distilled in the simple terms I use to understand it myself: bitcoins are produced when blocks of encrypted information are solved. By design, this encryption process gets harder every time, so the supply dwindles as time goes on, and there is a finite amount of bitcoins (solved puzzles) that can ever be made.
