I've got an HK card.  I may be sending BTC from overseas, but this money isn't 'foreign' influence.  Use it well, and good luck.

Looks like Gavin was trying to get Bitcoin to be successful. Something similar is going on in /btc to help that currency become successful?

Just look and you will see so many complaints regarding their trading engine.  But no exchange has everything one would want... Yet.

Fiat means government issued.  So if it is non fiat...it isn't government issued.  
Virtual non fiat.
Other fiats are less trust worthy because they're government issued.  If there is less trust, then it isn't as valued...

If freedom and oppression are so important to you, then shouldn't free speech also be important as well?  
On the other hand, I do love the post.   Thank you for taking the time to write it.   I really like how you state that Bitcoin is Freedom.  I do hope that bitcoin is on its way with lightning and segwit; but I am just wondering about your opinion about bitcoin cash vs bitcoin.  
I mean - I really want to understand the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash from point of view - but it seems mods disallow any sort of discussion.  I am curious as to why this is the case as it isn't healthy or democratic for any subreddit to quash discussions on this topic before they even start.  I only get point of view on this topic .  It's only fair to bitcoin that I get to see more discussion on the comparisons from point of view, isn't it?
