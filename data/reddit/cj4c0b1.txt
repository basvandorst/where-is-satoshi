Hi. I use MB with the lowest fee possible and it always confirm and work. You cannot cancel it. Neither double spend.
If the transaction is good you should be patient.

Relax. This is another honey pot for DUMB asses.

Hi. its not the miner rate. i send btc with multi and use the lowest possible miner rate without any problem and as fast as the normal fee.
If you wallet is syncing with the blockchain, it should not be a problem. BUT if the transaction is not showing in the block explorer, that is.
If you are reading anything lower than 10 peers your are not connected to the nodes.
Close the wallet and try to update it or just install a new one and try to recover your old wallet using the 12 passphrases. good luck.

You can buy bitcoin with PayPal at VirWox. You just send the money with Paypal, buy SSL, then you can buy BTC. Beware of the HIGH taxes applied to funding with PayPal..
