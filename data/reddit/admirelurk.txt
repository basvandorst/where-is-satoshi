Maybe not everyone NEEDS to be on the train. Maybe the huge cargo containers can be transported otherwise.
With a fully operational implementation of Lighting we can support 16 million heavy users for an almost unlimited amount of transactions. Sure, it might not be ready just yet, but when considering upgrading our (train) infrastructure we should keep in mind that it might be obsolete soon.

SegWit also burdens the nodes extra. The big difference is that it is a soft-fork instead of unlimited hard-forks and therefore much safer.

You can totally ban bitcoin. You can even prevent most people from using it. China chooses not to because right now it works in their best interest.

The transaction fee is recorded for the entire transaction, from which the sat/byte number is calculated. I can make a 200 byte transaction with 1 Satoshi fee, which is 0.005 sat/byte.
What you describe can still become a problem at some point, when a Satoshi becomes worth too much (BTC = $10M+). But by then we can probably figure something out, like forking to allow Satoshis to be split up further.

This is completely false. You can have a 2 of 3 multisig wallet, meaning if you lose one, you still have all your coins.

Are there people only mining when there is an excess? Because in my understanding miners use a very constant amount of power.

Faith has everything to do with it. Faith that the currency you have today will still be worth anything tomorrow.
Contrary to what most bitcoiners believe, monetary policy does ensure a more stable valuation of a currency. Of course that comes at the price of freedom.

This is just not true. Hard forks are indeed enforced by the users, but the miners do have a large influence. What if after 2X forks off there is only 10% of the hashing power left? The original chain will either be crippled with slow blocks and unprofitable mining for months or needs a risky difficulty adjustment hardfork that opens it up to wipeout attacks.
Having the mining power is not absolutely required, but it helps a great deal.
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:30:34
If you're not a heavy trader, leaving your Bitcoin on an exchange where you don't control the private keys is always a bad idea.
I would absolutely move it for security's sake. The best time to do it was a long time ago, but the second best time is now.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:39:34
Depending on the amount of hashing power they lose, you'll get a proportionally larger mining reward eventually. But not much.

That number doesn't mean anything. I can put in a buy order for 100k Bitcoin for an extremely small price and it would still be counted for the total.

There are other, better ways of limiting bandwidth. Pruning removes old blocks, but you can also just disable/limit the sharing of old blocks. You can do the same for relaying unconfirmed transactions, which is unrelated to pruning.

I understand that inflation is bad for those with savings. But that is exactly what the working class has less of.

Yes, that's what inflation is. So why is it unnecessary and hurtful for the economy? There's enough sources that say it is actually essential.

While it probably can't be stopped completely, legislation can absolutely impact usability. Consider mandatory identity checks or account termination for transferring money from/to exchanges.

@_date: 2017-04-21 09:39:50
That's too easy to game. First of all, the mempool is not part of the consensus; Everyone can have a different set of transactions in mempool. Second, it is easy to create gigabytes of transactions with small fees. Third, miners can include transactions in their own blocks that only move their own coins around with an arbitrary transaction fee; They won't lose a satoshi as they will receive their own miner fees back.
In the end, such system would always mean the miners have full control over the block size.
@_date: 2017-04-21 10:37:47
What I'm referring to is that one miner can create transactions and not broadcast them. As such, other miners can't profit from it (unless the block is orphaned).
@_date: 2017-04-17 00:32:43
SegWit doesn't solve any of those things.
@_date: 2017-04-20 22:10:41
It can, we just need a hardfork to increase the speed of light.

The EU can regulate financial transactions to exchanges even if they are located overseas.

SegWit itself already defeats asicboost. Also, they can block SegWit even without asicboost. Defeating asicboost first and doing SegWit later doesn't make sense.

The network has more than enough nodes to work. Running a full node is only useful if you use it to verify your transactions.

SegWit will still increase the load on full nodes linearly. Verification does not get faster. It requires more computational power proportional to its increase in transaction capacity. The only performance improvement (for full nodes) is that not all the witness data needs to be stored.
SegWit is a great improvement, but in itself (without layer 2) not much better a scaling solution than a pure block size increase. It is not logarithmic as you claim.


There is nothing wrong with a fee market. Supply and demand is a vital concept to Bitcoin. The problem is that fees are too high (possibly due to spamming) because of the full blocks.
Lastly, SegWit (or layer 2 transactions) will hardly limit the influence of miners; Your commit transactions still need to be on the chain

Right, but if BIP91 locks in, that doesn't guarantee that there will be a hardfork. The miners can get back on this promise and t's unlikely that any of the large pools are actually running BTC1 anyway.
I'm convinced that if BIP91 activates, there will be yet another debate about the 2MB block size increase (with possibly including some other HF improvements), with a significant portion of the community opposing any HF.

If you expect both chains to survive, it's better to wait because the exchange rates will likely plummet in that case.
