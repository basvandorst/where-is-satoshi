I gave the film a 4.5/5 myself. I enjoyed the parts when a few viewers were asking how they can get their hands on some BTCs.  😎
Perhaps the seed was planted.

I'm waiting to watch this now. Too bad the theater is empty.

I wonder if Mr. Rogers would make his audience aware of the power of Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:21:11
Amen brother.

Bitcoin used as product-placement.  I never would have thought I'd see the day.  :)

Love the story!

I love technology. I embrace them all.

Great find!

"Bing the Google" is my new phrase of the day!

I am simply speechless!  :)
Thank you Rep. Polis for sticking up for us little guys (and gals) supporting this revolutionary idea which I believe will only unite us as a world--not divide us.
...I especially loved that part where you highlight that "no politicians can manipulate it".  Nice touch.  :)

Great story that shows the true potential BTC has to offer in a global economy.

I understand the reason for doing it.  I'm a Circle fan too.  :)

Where did you get your source for that buying price?  Preev is listing $655 on my end.
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:57:55
I agree. I am a loyal Circle fan too.

I lived there for many years. I never got the impression that German consumers didn't prefer credit, I got the impression that German commerce didn't prefer credit. 
My understanding was that it had to do with the high service and usage fees that credit companies charged for each transaction.

I selected the instrument (Planet) and it sounds amazing! I just discovered it today while looking for a price chart and feel like I've been missing out this entire time.  I saw that other users have brought it up in the past over a year ago but today feels like a special day. I hope the mods don't mind.

I couldn't stop laughing when he turned back and told them to shoosh.  :)  That's exactly what I feel like doing too when I see or hear new BTC owners complaining about the price dropping.

I just wanted to say thank you for doing this. Your one block in promoting economic freedom in human history. 
Never give up!

I don't appreciate price speculation. There are too many variables for anyone to predict the future buying price for bitcoins. 
Instead we should praise its power for real economic freedom and aiding those who wish to raise a peaceful middle finger to the FED and all central banks around the globe.

This could have been prevented if their government had a more powerful FCC like the U.S. Who had the people's interests. Too bad they don't have a net neutrality equivalent

Our economy is small now. The Internet was small once too.

I remember the feeling to finally own my first one. Next goal will be 2 of them! 
@_date: 2016-10-17 13:45:59
Excellent delivery. Thanks! :)

He has my support at our convention.

I said it out loud right before I read your comment. 👍
