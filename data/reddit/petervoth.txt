I made a purchase on bitcoinstore dot com and so far they've updated my order status from "ordered" to "purchase confirmed". 
This was 2 days ago in the AM, right before the price drop - I got $249.89 usd/1btc so they stand to lose on my order right now... nothing shipped yet though, I'll report back with updates as I'm concerned too.
UPDATE: Well, placed my order Wednesday AM (11am-ish in Ottawa, 4/10/13)... it's now almost 4pm here and no update that my order's shipped. I know they're in California so there's still a few hours left in their work day... really hoping to see an update otherwise I don't think my purchase is moving until after the weekend. 
Just a note to other merchants, just because btc is behaving erraticly doesn't mean your business should too. If you want to build consumer confidence, keep up with other businesses. You don't build the products you sell yourself, your business is to distribute. You're up against eBay sellers, Amazon and frankly everyone else online trying to earn my btc/dollar. All I'm saying is..... you had 1 job :p Ship me my goodies plz so I can START advertising your business to all my friends :)
UPDATE  Just got my shipping confirmation with tracking order :) Feeling much better now. I'll post a final update once the product arrives if anyone wants? Otherwise I believe we're safe to shop at BitCoinStore.com :)
UPDATE  April 22nd and my order has arrived in Ottawa, Canada. Took 12 days despite "rush" shipping but I'll hand that one to the usps :) Product arrived in brand new condition, no complaints on my end. 
Of all the scams that ARE floating around, bitcoinstore.com is legit and I will happily do business with them again. Viva la bitcoin! :)

Happy birthday buddy :) My own cake day is next Monday, maybe I'll continue the tipping tradition :)

Bitcoin is just as "illegal" as cash. Anything I can start doing illegally with btc I could have done illegally with cash already... printed by our very own gov't too... think about it...

Payment was fastest / easiest I've ever had. Shipping on the other hand... :)
