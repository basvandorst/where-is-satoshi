ok, but your comparison isn't valid because you lack consistency in measurement.
You can't have one part talking about yesterday's BTC value and compare what things cost today in today's BTC value.
You have to either use today's or yesterday's value consistently. Not both.

This is an interesting viewpoint. What will happen? Well, someone holds the pursestrings to that debt. In order to be in debt, you have to have a debtor.
Who is our debtor? Who are we borrowing from?
If it's ourselves, yes, this can just go on forever. Robbing our later selves to pay our current selves' toys for generations. Each generation puts the next two in debt indefinitely. Eventually it will come to a head and a revolution will occur. Who knows when that will be.
If it's another country? Well, eventually they'll want their money back won't they?

Who the hell would risk buying Turkish money with a straight face?

I didn't explain myself fully I believe.
So, lets say for sake of easy math, that back in the day when he purchased these units, he paid 110BTC at $5USD per BTC, so $550USD.
So the second portion of the comparison says that it would mine 55BTC. He's still thinking of that 55BTC in terms of **back in the day**'s value.
*I'm not sure how this thing mines stuff, I've not looked at it, I'm just going by the time+math here trying to figure out if he's making a good profit or if he's suffering a loss). 
Everyone seems to be implying that he's suffering a loss here. Let's work out the math. If he starts making this 55BTC when the value is at $100USD (versus the $5USD, the **back in the day** price). If the value of BTC never drops below $100USD/BTC, or at leasts averages that, then 55 * 100 = 5500 - 550 original investment = 4950 profit (minus maintenance fees).
Seems like a good investment no?

/meh. Tumbling Service?
@_date: 2013-05-31 10:14:33
Yes, that's possible. Only it works a little differently than you described. THe methods are available on TrueCrypt's website.
I really should do something like this with a largish usb thumb drive.
As far as confiscating bitcoins...put your wallet on the truecrypt thumb drive. They can take the drive, but they'll never get your coins!

Yet one more reason to hate the CC companies.
It must be this way. Tie your BTC to your bank account for cheap slow BTC convrsion or pay cash with increased fees if you want it instantly.
On a side note, I can pay for moneygram (zipzap bill pay) with my debit card at the Walmart counter. I've not yet tried it at the gas station down the road. They do moneygram there too.

I just got through doing this and I had to get verified, but I had one slight thing going on with mine. I had another account tied to the same address and had to remove one and get the other verified in order to be able to withdraw bitcoins (I only use Gox to move bitcoins from bitinstant to my wallet, looks like from this point on, I'll just move from bit instant to my wallet directly. Then from there to a tumbling service of some sort.)
What we really need is something that will let us use a debit card to directly purchase BTC and send it to a bitcoin address. Not just a something, but several somethings - competition lowers prices.
From there, send it to a tumbling service then to your wallet. Where it will sit, nice and anonymous, until you decide to use it on something.
