Sorry if the owner was advertising it wouldn't look this bad. I will find someone with a screenshot of it. I can take off the site name if it would help. 
If there is a way to edit site name out of topic name please let me know how.

Everyone has fantasized about winning the lotto and making it big! Well with a well timed deposit of just 0.02BTC it became reality for E.Snowden and members of the dice chat room even if it was for 1 night.
E.Snowden started the night with a .02 deposit with full intentions of "going big or going home". After several respectful wins he ended up winning 26 btc on .001 bet, 20 btc win on .01 bet, 11 btc on .01 bet, and 5 btc on .01 bet. Talk about a lucky seed if there ever was one! This is just the beginning of the fun.
Whats the best thing besides winning big? Tits! Some may disagree but I'm fairly confident the majority of us enjoy a nice rack and that's exactly what we got! E.Snowden posted an offer of his winning if anyone would flash the chat room on live stream. We will just call her Double D's stepped up to the task. The final amount tipped for these fine pair was roughly 0.3btc. After the show Snowden generously decides to make it snow by showering multiple members with bitcoin.
Is E.Snowden a legend some may ask? No, hes just an average man that knows how to have a good time. Great night overall at in the chat room.
