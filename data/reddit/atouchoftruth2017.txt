Where do you live? USA is usually restricted to options and futures. look up CFD's and see if you have brokers that offer them in your country. IG Markets, CMC Markets, Plus500 to name a few

Lots of people make money arbitraging, as the spreads can sometimes be $1500 per coin.
I've work a guy who is very very good at, so good he had his last day on friday. gave up a $150k P.A Job as it pales to what he makes

Lets say apple was first to do the mass adoption smartphone, they owned market penetration and market share until it became a behemoth. it now has competition, very serious competition. 
I'd say Bitcoin is to block chain what apple was to Smartphone.
You are right, one day someones tech will possibly out block chain tech bitcoin, its just how evolution works.
but does that mean they'll become the dominant position?.
Look where apple is now, its so dug in, so part of the market and environment. That its taken this long for other manufactures to start knocking off its tower, is a testament to the strength behind it. Even with bendy wendy phones and all the other downsides they have had over the years, they still are in the position they are in, and who knows how long, if ever they are going to be a non-player.
Same with Microsoft and Windows operating systems.
I believe there will be/are definitely better block chain companies out there. but they didn't have first mover advantage, branding and the market penetration. BITCOIN has the 10 years advantage, its now for the others to catch up. Moving into 2018 will bring renewed eyes on alt coins and their value compared to BTC, especially because of this recent leg down in bitcoin prices. who's going to be bringing the competition? if no one then BTC with thrive for a while longer

Lets take a tally, 
are you:
a speculator hoping for a rise in price, buying in and not spending coins 
or 
do you convert your Fiat to Bitcoin, and then spend bitcoins as a source of money.
if you decide you cant fit within either category, where do you stand?

bitcoin is Illiquid as fuck, hence the price swings.
watch the market it real time and you can see where actual buyers and sellers are placing positions.
I've been watching the offers ramp up continuously today,  with larger and larger offers coming in as the price goes down. 200 coins now offered at 1935, this will be the next big hurdle in the very short term (hours)

You forget a large amount of Bitcoins are in the hands of TRADERS.
this has nothing to do with stock markets or bond markets or FX markets, this has to do with how traders trade, which is why if you look up any financial product you will see the same repeating patterns over and over, its how humans trade and how humans have written Algos to trade.
something you shouldn't discount or brush off, and this is coming from someone who has traded all the above, including bitcoin

Agree with you there, but maybe a day or 2 
before we get between $1400-$1600.
you cant discount everyone who thinks 1500-1600 will be the steady low, it might hold it, only for it fail to get above 2000 again.
then we'll see 1400 get some action
