its the same app that was in the app store. Like how you can download the flappy bird APK for android devices, ios has a .deb extension for apps you can only install once jailbroken.

I don't get why everyone is up in arms. It's not like btc is as liquid as a debit card or cash. You're not going to be spending them to get gas in your car and lunch. So why does everyone need the app.

Okay he was at defcon tho. And I highly doubt that any software injection could actually ruin any of the hardware. You can ALWAYS put it into dfu and restore through iTunes. I love that shit. Easy and it always works unless there's an actual hardware issue. Never software. I hate flashing android to stock with Odin. Shit is obnoxious and temperamental. Plus the app is published by blockchain. The fuck does "Getting owned" mean for a cell phone anyway.

Network? Which one? 4g,3G, edge, GSM/CDMA, wifi, hell even Bluetooth could be considered a "network". All of those have antennas. If they don't work it's a hardware issue. Which most can be replaced except wifi since that shits built into the board.

Or your job? I get all kinds of shit delivered to my work because I'm actually there during the day and can sign for shit.
