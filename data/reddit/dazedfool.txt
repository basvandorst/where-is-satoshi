Uh-huh... "thousands upon thousands" in the hole and you've been holding for three years?
Do it. Dump it all. Like a champ!

There's a quote somewhere about hindsight being 20-20 or something like that...
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:58:58
Nope. Well probably not. But maybe?

Problem is most TA theory is based on the stock markets. Not saying it's accurate or nonsense, but Bitcoin isn't quite a stock.

Well WA still has Bittrex.
And Bittrex has a damned picture of the Space Needle on their front page.. so hopefully they won't go the route of Polo, Bitstamp, Kraken, etc

Identifying locations with restrictions is not surprising, my point is they have not barred WA yet^TM

He did say "Uh" "Uhm" and "You know" a lot.

Digital currency only? Or will you store my gold bars too?

You're telling me that institutional investors dumping billions of USD into these investment instruments "for dumbasses" and all those that follow will have nothing to do with bitcoin? They won't hoard bitcoins, decreasing supply? They won't create some ridiculous paper derivative market affecting conversion rates and valuations? They won't raise more awareness? Sure these won't affect typical transactions or the ideal marketplace. But you really think nothing at all to do with bitcoin?

I've had no problems. But there are several similar posts/reports of this issue. Be aware all those questions are pulled from your credit reports. Get a copy, scour over them, and you should be able to answer the questions.

Nice, too bad SecondMarket and the Winklevii are working out ways to charge those fees.

Are you high? I have no idea what you're rambling about. But I am in for one satoshi!

Try Craigslist if you're in/near a major metro. I've done a few silver/gold -&gt; BTC trades this way.
