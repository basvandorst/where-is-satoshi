For consumers, sure they can ignore the regulations. Corporations however cannot. Corporate executives must act in the best interests of their shareholders. That means being regulatory compliant. A currency restricted from commercial corporate use is unlikely to expand beyond the consumer fringe market.

This video is a great explanation! RibbitRewards is going to take blockchain technology to the mainstream.

Exciting stuff. Ribbit is taking the blockchain beyond currency into the cash-back rewards industry.

The global central bank cabel prints hundreds of millions of dollars every minute. It is not even a grain of sand to them.

Awesome! RibbitRewards is going to finally bring the blockchain to the mainstream!

Paypal will never have a PaypalCoin because the first person who uses it for illegal activity will destroy the brand value. It would only be possible if the coin cannot be used outside of Paypal proprietary systems. That is not a Crypto currency.

It was a pleasure working with you Bruce and Austin to put together an outstanding FIRST Dubai Bitcoin Conference. It was also an honor for Ribbit.me to sponsor the event and share the excitement of soon to launch RibbitRewards, helping Bitcoin to take blockchain technology to the mainstream.
It was fantastic to meet all of the brilliant Bitcoin technology entrepreneurs from MENA. What a bright future Bitcoin technology has there. I think this may actually warrant splitting my time living both in NYC and Dubai next year. There is so much going on!
I am already getting started working on the SECOND Annual Dubai Bitcoin Conference. With one year under our belts, next year's conference will be EPIC!

Great news!

I completely agree! Everyone here should be signing up to attend the Dubai Bitcoin Conference coming up later this year.

Put a gun to someone's head or threaten to kill their family and most people with authority will do just about anything, including the unknown humans controlling ghash.io. Do we even know who they are?

LOL! If true, that is awesome.

This panel was amazing. Phil was the visionary who foresaw music as currency. Blockchain technology can do so much more than just currency. It is going to turn Phil's vision into reality with branded coins. The brand becomes the coin, and the music is the currency.

A more appropriate question is: who will still mine when mining is unprofitable for everyone? The answer is the miner mining at an economic lose for other reasons, such as control, power or malicious intent. This is the question Bitcoin's are afraid to face and answer, sadly.

The Bitcoin killer app will be the app that kills Bitcoin, making it an inferior competitor in the Crypto Ledger economy.

Disrupting the loyalty rewards industry just as Bitcoin is disrupting the money industry? This is long overdue!
