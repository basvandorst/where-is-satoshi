Venezuelan here. 
High end houses are going cheap (In comparison as before). This place is called [Fortaleza]( (literally Fortress, kind of give you an idea of what they are trying to sell) and is one of the newest residencies in one of the best neighborhoods in Maracaibo (Venezuela second largest city). Prices were 3 million USD per house two years ago, now they are going for 300k (Maybe less).

That's the way most new houses and apartments are sold in Venezuela, 'en gris' (in gray). That way the new owner can decorate it to his/her liking. Remember people buying this place is not by any means poor, they are still spending 300k USD for a house.
I mean, yes, Venezuela is pretty bad and lot and lot of people are starving and having a bad time (like our Venezuelan OP claims he is). But is not everybody. There's still a percentage of  the population (10-20%) that makes money and can afford basic (and not so basic) stuff. In fact, a new economy is being build on top of the disaster, wages are improving and people are second guessing leaving the country.
In fact if you go to a supermarket now you will see it is full of food, big part of it imported and most probably not affordable to the average Venezuelan. Even the Chiguire Bipolar (Kind of Venezuela's The Onion) jok about it [Walmart blames Venezuela for their shortages in snacks](	
(I live in Venezuela, own business here, and also work regularly abroad as a contractor, so my experience is vastly different from OP)

There could be plenty of ways. There could be a faucet, there could be give away using social media, there could be a group of people giving out paper wallets with a small amount of bitcoin on it. People would be wary of anything that force them to reveal their identity (As this is still a grey area) so any passport related distribution should be approached carefully.
Anyone all over the world could contribute to this "Venezuelan Bitcoin fund" in charge of distributing bitcoin in Venezuela. Remember, you don't need to give btc to every single one here, nor change all the bolivares to btc. Just spark the ecosystem. Venezuela could become the example of an actual country running on btc and this will raise the price as it will prove you can use it as a currency. So anyone investing on the fund will benefit indirectly.
Now, I don't think a massive donation it's necessary (although it will surely speed things up) as btc is better than bolivares (as dollars or any other currency is better than bolivares) so people will naturally seek them. I believe you mainly need more easy to understand and easy to use Wallets (even if there's a middle man) to make it easier for people to buy some bitcoin (even if they are just buying a few satoshi). I think that's the main issue, getting the average Joe (the average Jose on this case) to use it on a daily basis. Getting local business on your side setting payment options for them (and make them pay part of the salary on bitcoin) will surely help as well.

I'm from Venezuela and I actually did the math two or three weeks ago :)
It takes 81.634 btc to change every single Bolivar (Venezuelan devaluated currency) to bitcoin at black market rate (Then 700.000 bolivar/USD, now around 850.000 bolivar/USD), of course, you don't need to change every single bolivar, the whole point will be spark the use of bitcoin for every day use. You don't want to give money away, you want to give people a better money (and any money is better than bolívares) 
Right now, some people are asking for payment in USD in their US bank accounts. So, if I want to buy a car from you, I pay you 1.000 $ from my USD bank account to your USD bank account, the money never entering the country, but the transaction taking place. The goverment can't tax this or do anything about it. This started with big stuff (Cars, real estate, rent) but now due to hyperinflation people are doing it for small stuff (I heard gym trainers asking to be paid on USD!). People are really smart when they need to go around goverment regulations.
So, what do you try to achieve? Hyperbitcoinization in one country. The goal will be to have people transacting on bitcoin instead of bolivares for most every day stuff. You need people buying coffee and business paying wages on bitcoin. The goverment couldn't tax this and most important, it will give people some kind of stability (Bitcoin can go up and down, but bolivar will only go down). Bitcoin is resistant enough that the only way to shut this down is to shut down the entire internet.
So, if somebody is willing to sacrifice say 1.000 btc and receive worthless bolivares with the goal of sparking the use of btc for daily transaction, people will gain interest, demand payment to be made in bitcoin (Some people get bonuses on USD, but most of the population can't as they don't have an US bank account ... no issue getting a bitcoin wallet though) and people will start changing THEIR worthless bolivares to btc. This process will end up with people not taking bolivares and only accepting btc, the bolivar going completely worthless (no one wiling to buy it or receive it) therefore removing the power of the goverment on economic issues and the ability to print money out of thin air to pay for stuff (and destroying any ability to save).
I believe that if this happened, it will lead to regime change. The government is broke and can only pay for stuff by printing worthless money. The government will be unable to buy BTC (as is broke) and mass resignation will come from the military, ministries, and every mid and low goverment ranks (people won't be willing to work for worthless bolivares and the goverment won't be able to pay on btc). This will led to a goverment unable to exercise power and crumbling apart.
A man can dream, right? :)

I'm Venezuelan. I'm giving you first hand account of what's happening and is not as you said.
1) Venezuela can't print paper to pay 'their world bills'. Bolivares are only good to pay internal debt and internal bills (Like government wages). They destroy the economy by printing money no stop, obliterating the value of the Bolivar and the savings of all Venezuela. They've been doing this for year, without any help of US Sanctions. The economic disaster is 100% fault of the Venezuelan Government.
2) There is no sanctions on 'toilet paper'. Toilet paper has been scarce since the government took over the factories and guess what, they stop working. The Government or any individual citizen can import a container full of Toilet Paper to Venezuela (and probably pay a lot of bribes to get it in country) The problem is that toilet paper cost the same as any other country but the Venezuelan minimum wage is 6 USD (Due to hyperinflation). This is true with any other item. You can buy imported food (or almost anything) in Venezuela, but they are too expensive for the average citizen.
3) Oil prices was just covering the HUGE economic mismanagement done by the government. The economic went to shit not because oil prices fell (They should have been prepared to that), but because they stole all the money and when oil prices fell it him them in the face (beside leaving no more money for then to steal). 
You're spreading misinformation either by ignorance or malice. Probably both.
@_date: 2019-03-19 09:32:54


What? There's no list of sanctioned items by the US. Stop spreading misinformation. 
You can actually buy toilet paper in Venezuela. It just cost one month salary. The problem in Venezuela is not due to US sanctions, is due to the government economic mismanagement.

They are suffering because of Maduro and socialism, not because of the sanctions.
To end the suffering, end Maduro.

Nobody exchanges dollars for Venezuelan Currency anywhere in the world. So the government can't just print Venezuelan currency and exchange all that for US dollars. Is not how it works.


There are not. Look for it. Sanctions are mainly for individuals that belongs to the goverment. It affects them, not the regular population. You can go to a Venezuelan supermarket and buy everything you need, if you have the money to pay for international prices. Most Venezuelans do not.
The lack of medicines and food is due to two simple reasons 1) Government stole the money assigned to buy food and medicines 2) Government destroyed the currency so most people can't buy food and medicines themselves.


In their bank accounts.
[Just one guy stole 1 billion dollars](	
[Overprice on oil contracts](	
[Gold being stoled from the central bank and sold at Uganda](	
[Buying low quality food in Mexico and selling in Venezuela with a HUGE markup](	
[This is a former regime member who just defected and is opening the lid on millions of dollars stolen on what should have been used on medicines](	
This is just a few examples. Some estimate the amount stolen from the Venezuelan people in the hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars.


Guaido US education does not matter. This is not about Guaido. This is about a corrupt regime who has been murdering the population by repressing it.
This attempt to oust Maduro is just the latest of a series of fights we Venezuelans had done to reclaim freedom (Look for protest in 2014 and 2017 ... hell, look for protest in 2002).
By making this an attack on US policy, you're defending a murderous regime that the population itself wants out immediately.  We don't care about US policy or about Guaido. We want Maduro out so we can start rebuilding our country.
Now, tell me something. Do you support Maduro? 
@_date: 2019-03-15 05:13:24
Except that most Venezuelans are actually asking for US intervention as the Maduro regime has failed us in every possible way (blackouts, lack of food, lack of rule of law) and refuses to step down by any peaceful means.

Scandinavian are not socialist. They are capitalist countries. There's free enterprise, freedom of the press, the goverment won't confiscate your labour. None of this stuff are available in Socialist Venezuela, ruled by the Socialist Party, and by the sham "president" and self proclaimed socialist Nicolas Maduro.
You don't want socialism. You want capitalism with a stronger safety net. If you really wanted socialism you will move to Venezuela.
You socialists should be the first in line to get rid of Maduro. He gives you a bad name. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 10:21:39
The US sanctions has been in place for weeks, Venezuela crisis has been going on for years. Previous sanctions were against specific individuals, so they are not to blame for the crisis, that was 100% Maduro's goverment fault.
Do your own research. Don't go around repeating what you hear. As they say here, don't trust, verify.

Is an old exchange rate.
Currently is 1 usd = 3200 bolívares for the official rate and 1 usd = 3400ish bolívares for the black market (the government jack the official rate some weeks ago as they need hard currency to stay in power) 
@_date: 2019-01-19 13:54:53
It says it will take cash money where the largest cash bill is 500 bolivares (which is 20 cents). And I have never actually seen that bill (Is easier to find 100 bolivares notes).
It does not make sense.

If they are using your password and the FIRST 2FA you give them to login, how can they withdraw your money if they need a SECOND 2FA? They only got the first one anyway.

Venezuelan here.

@_date: 2018-04-16 04:19:34
The brown 100 Bolívar note you refer is the Bolívar fuerte. When inflation started to kick in, they release a new set of bills (still Bolívar fuerte) but just adding three zeros and changing the color palette. If you notice the bill in the picture it says "Cien mil (one hundred thousand)" written just under the 100.
Now, the government plan to remove three zeros again and call the new currency "Bolívar Soberano (Sovereign Bolívar)". This is scheduled for June. If (when) hyperinflation continues, they will have to take three zeros again probably around October/November.
And notice Bolívar Fuerte was a new currency released around ten years ago when they removed three zeros back then (Hope you're still following me!).
So the new 100 Bolívar Soberano note will really be 100.000.000 old Bolivares from before Chavez took over. The exchange rate for one single dollar was 500 bolívares back then (1999). Now it's 700.000.000 (going with the old Bolívar)

@_date: 2018-04-16 02:28:17
Brown is 100. Greenish is 100.000, the Venezuelan government just changed the color palette on the new bills.
Nobody is counterfeiting Bolivares that aren't worth the paper they are printed.

Bolívar went from 250.000/usd to 700.000/usd in the last two weeks. Hyperinflation is really kicking in now.
