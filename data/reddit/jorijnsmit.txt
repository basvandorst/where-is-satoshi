You cannot link multiple overseas accounts to one PayPal account. You can however create two separate accounts but a heavy commission fee will be charged plus exchange. I did this a while back and was not very happy with it.
I recommend doing it with bitcoin.
You might want to check localbitcoins.com or other alternative exchanges if you don't want to get charged GST.

Looked promising until I read the "from the creators of Skype".

I advise you not to create this whole Santa Claus letter around your question. The whole thread is now discussing your decision to invest instead of answering your initial question.
You are looking to buy bitcoins at numbers larger than 4 digits and Localbitcoins.com cannot be of sufficient service anymore.
Try [Circle]( [Bitstamp]( or [Kraken](
For a more complete overview of current exchanges see [this table on Bitcoincharts.com]( sortable by their volume, price etc.

I'm already having a hard time sorting out the uBTCs from the mBTC etc.  Then there's the still necessary conversion step. I don't really see room for more currencies there.

So pay for items/services using Bitcoin unless you can't, then use Xapo--it's the next best thing. Plus you can finally cancel your bank accounts!

Get a bank account with API support and buy bitcoins automatically when your salary comes in.

That doesn't sound like Kraken at all!

Chrome caught it and doesn't even display the site without warning me first.
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:02:54
Who cares? What do they have to say about it? 
Plus buying bitcoins doesn't look much different from any other transaction; it's just a transfer. To an exchange in this case, which you can then automatically let it convert the funds to crypto.

SegWit is 100% agreed upon by Bitcoin Core and 100% implemented. Adoption is just slow because it requires us to manually update which a lot of people are not doing. This is just a reminder. It's like hey make sure to change your tires this winter because it's very annoying to be  driving behind people that get stuck in the snow all the time.
It is a cut-and-dry positive but why people still believe otherwise is beyond me.
What is your argument against adopting SegWit?

Can't believe some people here find this acceptable/understandable. A limit on USD I can get into due to regulations but regulating BTC flow?? That's takes away the whole point of what we are trying to achieve with bitcoin.

The FCAC provides a nice online tool to help you compare different fees for a lot of banks: 
@_date: 2015-11-11 01:38:43
Try [Celery]( for USD side. EUR can be handled pretty cheap by [Bitstamp]( CNY and INR I have no experience with. Maybe [ANXBTC]( Compare some exchanges or parties mentioned on [BittyBot]( For a list of markets per currency take a look at [Bitcoin Charts]( Maybe avoid exchanges all together and hook up with some [Localbitcoins]( merchants, depending on your banking needs. 
Your biggest problem is going to be weaving it all together, finding one single exchange that can handle all your currencies is going to be tough.
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:29:05
It's not an investment it's a currency.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:53:35
I say Celery because it is definitely the cheapest option for my CAD. Not sure how the USD exchange rate compares to that of others.
@_date: 2015-03-06 21:13:57
They're in the process of integrating KYC measures, there have been other users reporting the same problem. You have to send a copy of your passport etc.
Just forget about Xapo, it has nothing to do with putting the power of banking in your own hands but it is just another bank.

As of now there are only two arbitraries, one of which is the lead developer. There is a list you can check in the app.

It opens a connection to a WebSocket of unconfirmed transactions. It then keeps two lists; one of input and one of  output addresses. Each cycle it counts the output addresses that are not in the list of input addresses and prints this total. After 24 hours it stops.
