When it doubles from 15k to 30k your 1k investment will be worth 16k.
Imagine you are 1 year old and your brother is 15 years old, by the time he is 30 you will be 16, so your 1k investment will be worth 16k. Good luck investing!

"If you now send all of them to a new wallet, they will be merged into one address, revealing their association. If you do this, you might as well not have used an HD wallet in the first place, because its entire purpose is now in vain."
