OP mentioned 10K and 11K.
But since you mentioned 9K and 11K I'll do one for you.  That's like going from $45 to $55.

Ha!  That's like my friends who join an MLM and change their profession to the CEO of an international distribution conglomerate.

coinmarketcap is where you need to look.  It weights different exchanges by volume to come up with the price.  Anything else is just an alt.

A little more than doubling is the moon for you?  So $450 was the moon back when BTC was $210?

Many people here made a few day trades where they got lucky, and now they are iamverysmart day traders.
Yesterday at an all time high, Coinbase went down.  And it happened to stay down all through through the crash to $9000.  These day traders all imagine they would have sold at the peak and rebought at the bottom.
So they are pissed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:10:56
Yay!  One lucky move!  Not I'll go on r/bitcoin and give authoritative advice about buying dips!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:36:05
After reading through the comments posted thus far your answer is clear: no one knows.

Go post this at r/arktrader !   (But change "Bitcoin" to "ARK")

Of course you can avoid being cheated on... just avoid a relationship.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:21:49
It's unlikely, but people say to avoid Coinbase because of the risk of bad actors trying to steal their money.   Bad actors could work at Ledger, Trezor, or the chip manufacturers as well.  
You're also trusting the firmware is what they say it is and that the RNG that creates the seed is legit.
Again, I think it's unlikely to be a problem, which is why I use a Ledger Nano S, but I also keep some in the Coinbase Vault.  If I die in the next few years, there's a decent chance my heirs won't be able to figure out the Ledger :D  At least they'll get the Coinbase money.

2%?  Who offers that?!

Analogies have to be 100% accurate in every detail or else they don't make sense.  What point is OP trying to make!?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:55:42


Or it could simply mean a lot more people have bought.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:18:18
Not exactly the answer to your question, but Coinbase is just fine to hold your Bitcoin for now.  It carries risk, as does holding your BTC in a cold wallet, the risks are just different.  I would not spend the money on a hardware wallet until you have a couple thousand worth of BTC.

Crypto could provide a Universal Basic Income.  No reason Bitcoin or another Cryptoasset couldn't build it into their fee structure.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:55:15
huh?  Dips aren't recognizable until hindsight.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:11:44
It's a trick of the mind!  Going from $10,000 to $11,000 is the same as $3000 to $3,300 which just doesn't "feel" that big.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:03:10
Buy a little now.  Buy a little after.  Keep buying at regular intervals.  Diversify a bit into Ether and some other reputable alt coins.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:49:25
A girl in high school cheated on me.  Best to just avoid relationships. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:48:57
Ha!  So many people think they are able to time the market.  It's just confirmation bias!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:54:41
Coinbase is fine.  It's not a day trading platform.
When you get your Trezor send a very small amount to it.   Send part of that back to the exchange, but leave some in Trezor.  Wipe the Trezor and set it up again.   Make sure your small amount still exists.
Managing your own money privately carries risk as well.  One wrong move and you lose it all.   Also, no harm in leaving a percentage in the Coinbase Vault, and the rest in your own cold storage.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:57:04
Either one could have a hardware backdoor on the chip.  Use at your own risk.
I keep part in Coinbase vault, part in a Ledger Nano S, and part in an old fashioned paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:15:28
The sentiment of the article is good.  The source is absolute garbage.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:52:07
Like the others said, Coinbase.
Don't worry (if you don't want to) about a hardware wallet, paper wallet, or anything else until you have a decent sized chunk (depending on what that means to you). 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:03
ummm......  you do do know how percentages work.... right? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:56
Your return on investment is the same on each.  You can buy BTC in fractions.  You can invest $1000 in BTC when the price is $10K, or when the price is $3K, or when the price is $45.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:16:36
Do your part.  Go buy!
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:56:29
If you want usability, try Litecoin.  Beats Bcash in speed, fees, and merchant adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:56:03
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:15:09
I can't help you on the specifics, but if you're planning on buying less than $10,000 total, I'd worry about that later :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:01:35
+1 Coinbase
No complaints from me.  Thank you for bringing BTC to the masses :D
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:15:13
Does your business make a million dollars a year?  Oh it doesn't?   Then I'm not listening to you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:53:15
My opinion sounds the same as yours.  I was cheated on.  I can never trust another.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:17
You have a community of people here making all sorts of wild and random guesses based on how they "see" things.  Obviously it's all bull shit.  However, over the coming days and months, "something" will happen and some of the people who made random guesses will be right.  People will look at their post history and see THEY WERE RIGHT!  They get credibility and people listen to them, but they were just lucky.
If you are long on Bitcoin, just buy consistently over regular intervals and you'll be fine.  Also consider adding a bit of Ether or one of the other top alternatives.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:08
Ha!  Update this to the $9K price thread!
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:57:26
I want to agree with you.  (and I love Bitcoin!)  But my current transfer with a $4.50 fee that's been stuck for 20 minutes disagrees with you.
I &lt;3 Litecoin for transfers and payments.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:48:09
But.....  he posted on Twitter recently that Bcash has 6+ teams working on development!
I guess they're "his teams".
I liked the part where mocked the other guy since his business doesn't do $1,000,000 per year.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:07:29
AND they've done it while allowing people to buy $20 at a time.  They could put a $200 minimum, keep 90% of their business, while dropping 90% of their accounts.

Depending on your budget, just keep buying a bit at regular intervals.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:15:16
Coinbase was down yesterday when Bitcoin reached the all time high, and stayed down while the price tumbled down to $9000.  All of the iamverysmart day traders are pissed because their hindsight shows them that they lost a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:46:14
Elliot Wave is such BS.  It's just confirmation bias.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:25:52
I think that was pretty obvious, but thanks for telling me!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:49
Oh god stop making your random ass guesses and thinking you can outsmart the market.
If you are a long term holder of Bitcoin, just hold and ignore volatility.  If you just wanted short term profit or needed to cash out for real life reasons, you got your profits and be happy.
You will NOT outsmart this or any market.  Any "success" stories of timing the market you hear are just confirmation or survivor bias.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:57:25
I guess it will settle in at $7500 - $9500 for a couple months while it gets primed for the next big run.  Ether creeps up to $650.  Bcash swings between $300 and $3000 depending on Rver's mood.
These are just GUESSES.   Cost average!

India has a great history and culture that involves holding gold as a store of value.  Bitcoin will be a good fit.

Fiat is a Latin word which means "let it be done".  It's the term to refer to government issued money that has no other backing than the government saying it has value.  The US and most (maybe all?) other countries for a long time backed their currency with gold or silver.  The British Pound Sterling used to literally be 1 pound of sterling (92.5% purity) silver.
Another fun fact is that in 1964 a gallon of gas cost about a quarter.  Until 1964, US quarters contained silver.  The silver value of that quarter today is about $3.  So gas prices, in terms of the 1964 non-fiat coinage, is pretty much the same!

It might!  Cost average!

You really didn't seem to grasp the concept that you could buy Bitcoins in fractions based on your comment.  Instead of calling you an idiot I figured I'd explain it since you could be new.
From the perspective of an individual investor, the ROI from 3 to 3.3 is exactly the same as 10 to 11.  That's all I ever said or claimed.

Coinbase is fine for non-day trading.  It has problems on big days, but 98% of the time it works just fine.

This is not an issue with my Legder Nano S.  They use a secure RNG.  Oh shit I have no way of verifying that.  Trust is still in the system.  :(....
Oh well, I still like it.
