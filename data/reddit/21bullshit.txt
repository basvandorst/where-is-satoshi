Thiel, Skoll, Levchin, Ravikant, Pincus can all kiss their moneys good bye. AH and QCOM can afford it. These kids have no clue what consumer electronic industry is and no clue why would millions be handing them over 75% of stolen electricity. Btw, when is the coveted device coming to market. Cant wait to be making even more fun at this ludicracy !

and why the hell would I buy their charger and get peanuts. If I were to steal electricity I would get one of BitMain Antminers and plug it in and get 100 prc to myself ! Anyone else sees idiocity in thie proposal ? Who the fukc are they to make me want to make them rich ? Absurd..

for a company that was in a "stealth bull shit" mode for all of last 2 years and burnt through Thiel's; Levchin's and Pincus's money. Never mind Andreesen Horowitz. Hwr they are a large VC fund and Marc is a God so he can afford it :) Running out of of VC money and being "stealthy" 2nd-3rd tier miner at best, now they are dupping equipment providers to go with the "free elecricity" concept and putting together millions of chips into an efficient pool. Qcom Ventures eager to be affiliated with Andreesen Horowitz, was the first victim … with couple more to come. Hwr soon they all will realize its all a hoax. The BitSplit idea is a hoax and millions will be wasted.. There is no free lunch and consumers will always ask - what is there in for me ? why do I have to steal electricity at school; uni; starbucks and give away 75% of this to 21.

you got to be kidding me .. has someone addressed the backhaul problem ? why would I want to steal electricity and hand over 75 prc of revenues to 21/Qcom ? Ridiculous! Cant wait for a "working" model to appear on the market. Hope its not a toaster

I am ready to give a bounty of 100 BTC to whomever will prove linking millions of individual chips into an efficient pool is possible !
