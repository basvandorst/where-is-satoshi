Yes. And when those vacuum cleaner like machines lead underground, that is a process known as "Carbon Sequestration" When they don't, and they lead back to the atmosphere, that is a process known as "A Colossal Waste of Money"

When [these]( hit the market (or the next generation or two), we are all screwed.

Yeah, you're right. But OP was implying that counterfeiting with bitcoin is impossibru by saying that the author went full retard. Counterfeiting is a problem with any currency (or currencoid...whatever you wanna call bitcoin)

So looking forward to mega cheap FPGA's when the ASIC's hit :)

If it's symmetric key crypto they are using, they are boned. I mean, yes, Quantum Crypto is a POSSIBLE solution to this, however, everyone as far as I know is still using crypto based off of factoring large numbers, and so all that crypto and all the messages they shield will become vulnerable the day someone buys one of these things.

FPGA kinda killed GPU, and ASIC is gonna kinda kill FPGA. The days of getting a good return on mining on your home boxen are gone for good, I'm afraid :(

[Shor's Algorithm]( makes it possible to factor large numbers in polynomial time.

You are wrong. [AES uses large prime numbers to generate the ciphertext. ](
@_date: 2012-12-18 22:15:30
You're right. AES does not use large primes to encrypt things, and only RSA uses them in that way. However, seeing as how encryption keys for AES encrypted material are transmitted across the internet using RSA encrypted channels, material encrypted with AES could be compromised if RSA were to be broken with quantum crypto. Thanks for the clarification.

Yes, assuming a majority of nodes local to you in the network are not bots who are engaging in double spending. 
@_date: 2012-12-27 02:17:26
Botnets + double spending = free money. Pretty much the same as counterfeiting. Not that the author is not an idiot. Smuggling coal? Apparently he does not know that it is not the coal itself that would be monitored, but emissions from coals plants, which themselves are pretty hard to hide without concealing the emissions. At that point...you wanna make a coal power plant and sequester the carbon emissions? Our work here is done. :)

Wait, you mean you SHOULDN'T build your bittorrent site on a machine running Damn Vulnerable Linux? :)

Yeah, speculation did wonders for the stability of the housing market, amirite?

Since when did become a freakin' stock ticker? We don't need 3 posts a day talkiing about what the price is...
