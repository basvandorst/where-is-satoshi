WOW! What a great service!!! I can't wait to hurry up and send them all my BTC, BUT QUICK!

The Winklevoss Twins are my heroes, because they're so smart and honest. I saw it right there on the Internet.

And I understand that it's very beautiful. And a quick trip to Barcelona.

No. I just bought a bunch of bitcoin, then used some of it to buy some other coins. All downhill since then.
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:24:19
Honestly, I haven't looked at my wallets in probably 5-6 months.
edit... I really need to start 'em up and get up to speed with the chain.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:26:04
I'll second that.

I thought the tragedy was the music I lost when my drive crashed.

I think that was sarcasm.

*" The current volatility is maybe just teething pains, but otoh it is completely killing the utility value of bitcoin as a currency. Whoever accepted a $900 bitcoin yesterday night for goods is now $200 poorer, this is not a great way to do business."*
I agree with you about that. 
I think that someday people will look back and say that bitcoin had 2 stages: first it was a speculation-type thing, then it eventually matured and became stable and was useful as a currency.
It's not just the dips impoverishing payEEs, but the sudden surges impoverish payERs, in terms of opportunity cost. Why do I want to pay with this thing today knowing that it might be worth twice as much in a week?
Also, for both payers and payees there is the need to CONSTANTLY keep up with exchange rates, just make sure that you are not getting instantaneously shafted in realtime.
Once most of the coins are mined and it's been around for a long time, it will be useful as a currency. For now, I think of it as a good retirement investment. I think it will keep going up. I think $100,000+/BTC is a little optimistic for the foreseeable future, but $10,000/BTC within 5 years is certainly plausible to me.

Mr. Wire Transfer Fee and his buddy Long Delay are stopping me.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:33:16
And dollars do?

I have zero sympathy for people who step into a thing that is supposed be a step toward a new currency and try to use it as a get-rich-quick scheme, then lose some of what they invested. They are disrupting what should be a steady, natural process by which people become able to transact financially without the control of governments and large financial entities. Bitcoin and some other currencies will rise again, and hopefully you big-money market payers will be practicing your buy-sell-bottrade bullshit shenanigans elsewhere.
The only reason I give a shit at all is because I bought Monday at ~$700 and I still don't have my coin and now the value is lower. All I am going to do is buy other coin anyway, but this absurdly fast up and down is only due to the actions of ....
I'll say it: capitalists. You want to use your money to make more money and your greed makes you stupid and you're fucking everything up for the rest of us. Not completely fucking it up, just making it a complicated pain in the ass.

The pre-order price is factually the price of it, today.
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:01:14
to test and prove, like he said.

But I can buy it today. For a price. That price is the price of the software, today. 
You talk down to people so snidely like we're all so stupid and you're so smart. But it seems that you can't understand this very simple thing: the pre-order price buys the software **today**, and it'e the only way to buy the software **today**, so the price **today** is the pre-order price. So it costs roughly $800 **today**.

I'm thinking he wants to buy long, but he wants it to stay low while he gets his money in.

There is a speculation market for pretty much everything on this planet. There is no way to exempt bicoin from that.

He-e-e-e-ey, sexy lady!
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:34:09
No, the point was to make a sale by attracting people who are all into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:36:13
That's the decision I've made -- to wait at least for the gap to close somewhat.

crypto-rap -- you just defined a genre, yo!

LOLOLOLOL! Master of understatement, you.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:23:52
No, I think the offer was withdrawn after the buyer got a closer look at things.

Well, to be fair, a lot of people think homosexual orgies are not ridiculous at all.
