It seems you made a sound financial decision based on your current assets/debts, risk tolerance, etc. Locking in big gains by taking some off the table is always prudent. If you can get to the point where your remaining holdings are funded by previous gains then all the better. You're playing with "house" money at that point where loses are severely limited or impossible. That's a wise choice and something to be proud of for sure. There will always be future opportunities to purchase more bitcoins if you want add again to your remaining holdings. Personally I'm in for the long haul barring any unforeseen circumstances. The best days for bitcoin are still ahead but there will be plenty of opportunities to trade in and out for those so inclined.

Right on! The reasons to be a strong buyer now are practically endless! GLTY!

There neither is nor was a bitcoin ETF on the pink sheets. You're thinking of first bitcoin capital (BITCF) which was mainly mining and bitcoin investing company. That is not an ETF. They had questionable management which is why they were on the pink sheets to begin with. The new ETFs that are being discussed are fully compliant with all SEC regulations and will be listed on major exchanges just like SPY or GLD.

You answered your own question. If you have bitcoin as a store of wealth already... why would you not use it to pay for food at a restaurant? What value would there be in changing that back to some fiat to make that payment?

Welcome to the future of money! Make sure to research and learn how to possess your bitcoin and private key(s) personally. Exchanges like coinbase are pretty safe but nothing beats securely storing ones own keys. I'm sure you'll be very happy with this purchase when bitcoin is ~$100k+ by 2021. GLTY!

Search duckduckgo for bitcoin or blockchain use cases and you'll see why...

Congrats and good work. I'll be joining you one day as will many of us early adopters and evangelists. Great idea to take some off the table and let the 50% ride for the fun times ahead. :)

This is only one of 1,000 reasons that bitcoin is at, and will continue, new all time highs.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:28:30
That is due to bitcoin store of value purchases exceeding bitcoin medium of exchange purchases. Both use cases will continue to drive the other to wider and wider global adoption.

Don't think of it in terms of the network (LN)... that is transparent and behind the scenes to the user. Think of it in terms of coins. LN (with atomic swaps) enables users to purchase/settle across coin chains. In other words, you could go to a store and they only accept litecoin.. You only have bitcoin. Instead of one of you having to sell one coin and purchase the other to complete the transaction... you have the LN do that for you with an atomic swap. You see what you pay in bitcoin, they see what they receive in litecoin, and the deal is done.

Just a nice round year for price projections. Not too close but not too far (like 2030). I'm expecting $500k per BTC by then if my analysis is correct.

This has been my experience as well! Luckily she knows my expertise and hasn't gone back to stage 2 once that passed.

You're spot on. Bitcoin is becoming an asset class in and of itself. Even more interesting is this new asset class does not directly correlate to any other asset class currently in existence. This makes if fairly unique in history. An opportunity now exists to create generational wealth for those who "get it" early and hold for the long haul.

Depending on what you recently put in you'll probably own the nursing home in 10 years.

Thanks for sharing. I must say you're very wise for your age! I have a feeling you'll be very pleased when BTC is over $50k in a few years and even more by 2025. GLTY!

Further segregation is not the solution but it is a likely outcome for an intermediary period. Crypto millionaires/billionaires will probably be forced to congregate in certain geographies/neighborhoods to advance the transformational work they are doing as well as to ensure their security. 
The poor souls whose wealth has been stolen/destroyed by the corrupt establishment will be out for revenge. They will not possess the knowledge and education to understand that it's the bitcoin/blockchain people who are building the fair and equitable societal fabric of the future. The corrupt establishment will attempt to place blame on these visionaries and innovators in their last desperate attempt to retain power and control

Well said! The implication that this can be re-hypothotecated as on wall street is ludicrous as well. Once a coin is sold it's sold and it can't be sold again to someone else! It's incredibly refreshing watching bitcoin lately and seeing true supply/demand fundamentals at work. Not some algo driven, three times sold, re-hypothecated thing they call the wall street casino.

Exactly... when it's done well it is something that can be solved with more compute and more storage. But most startups are FAAAAR from doing it well and DEFINITELY not prepared for this type of growth... not in my experience anyway....
