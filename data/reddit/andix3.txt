With this you've said everything. It is indeed a hard correction. One for people who are familiar with the crypto market and understands its volatility. I personally made a bet with a friends that it will be $25,000 by 14th July - my birthday. This is just based on the past year's crypto market evolution. Let's see how it goes out 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:15:30
At least now if not then. 4x return in one year? Pretty good for some experts.

He's the type of person who cares more about providing something useful to the community instead of getting rich. Bitcoin needs more people like him!

Yes, you need to store the private key/seed on a paper. Somewhere safe. 
I had a friend who actually stored it in an online ebook that he wrote and only keep track of the page-row-word. 
Its up to you how you store the private key, but the chance of a ledger 'hack' is really really low.

You deserve to go to the moon with this comment!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:19:57
Forgot about "New Bugatti, Lambo,Tesla " 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:32:31
What we learn from this? 
Never bet against [Bitcoin](
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:28:58
It's not the moon yet! Keep HODLing. 
But we might put this day in the calendar. [Bitcoin made history]( today.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:37:17
HOLY SHIT HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?!?! Savage!
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:29:00
There are more details here about the PROs that the new device have. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:43:33
Sorry if you feel this way, we're trying to offer the latest news to the community. 
We might be a bit late with the news, but there's no reason to be rude about it.
All the respect,
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:03:03
At today's [price]( - some people surely afford one without even selling all their bitcoin. Amazing
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:39:52
Yea, 
But its not a Tesla or a Lamborghini. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:41:02
WSJ wrote this first. Sorry if you didn't likeid the article, any feedback is great!
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:24:15
That's amazing! This is a day to put in the calender. Bitcoin made [history]( today. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:11:31
Thanks for the feedback! I changed it now to the correct form.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:35:57
Couldn't agree with you more, though I explain my vision poorly. 
I'll leave this here. Even though cards are now controlled by VISA - maybe in the future a company would come and introduce a card meant especially for cryptocurrencies. The card won't be connected to a banking system. Instead, it will be available for a certain crypto and would be use in a limited number of places that will expand within a certain amount of time. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:16:14
maybe it will help
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:35:45
Congratz R0myt. Pareting done right. 
Bitcoin made [history]( today. 
Thanks Satoshi Nakamoto and thanks to everybody who made this possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:00:56
Sorry, I thought you were tired of hearing this news - as it was posted 7 hours ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:39:26
10K memes? Man, 9k memes felt like it was yesterday. 
Amazing [Bitcoin]( growth though. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:44:14
I personally believe that the Bitcoin was born when Satoshi mentioned it, not when it was implemented. But this is my personal opinion only. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:38:31
[Actually, No!](
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:33:16
On multiple [exchanges]( actually. It's also over 12k on Bithumb
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:15:20
Had a friend named David who wanted to buy Bitcoin at $5900.
Managed to do that and sold it at $6200.
He waited for [Bitcoin]( to reach under $6000, didn't happened so he bought at $8.7k
Sold at $9k again. Bought a car with the profit
Today I received a message from him telling me that he's thinking of selling the car to buy BTC again. 
Don't be David. Not yet
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:08:50
For the people news to this : [calaber24p]( said that he'll eat his [left nut]( if bitcoin [reach 10k]( by the end of 2017 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:05:18
Feels like yesterday [was full of vegeta posts.
Hopefully we'll see another increase in [Bitcoin's price]( over the next days
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:40:34
Anyone 'member the days when [1309.03 BTC = $1]( 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:57:28
Bitcoin is not the universal cryptocurrency - yet. Might be, or might not. Depends on us. 
But cryptocurrency cards are not such a bad thing. This way, people would use cryptocurrency - even though they'll spend it as FIAT. 
Also, Bitcoin can't become huge without having a card. People like to use cards. It's more easy and secure than with cash. In the future, with more and more people that use Bitcoin - FIAT may disspear. But it cannot go all at once, we need to understand this. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:02:09
You're right, modified the title in the article. Thanks for feedback! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:33:11
According to their website : Ethereum Based one.

@_date: 2018-02-06 14:16:39
Already did, it mooned!
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:43:38
There are options. Bitstamp &amp; GDAX looks like the favorite ones from some traders I've talked with. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:34:08
Please elaborate why you consider this is FUD news. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:45:57
IP address and probably other things too. I do not know this. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:28:54
you lost me at butcoin
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:59:24
Quite true! And they adapt to new things easier than anyone.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:23:25
Check them out :) 
 
TL;DR Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey, CoolWallet and OpenDime.

If Bitcoin hits only $100k we'll see John McAfee eating his own dick. Go for $500k. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:53:31
A moment of silence for Jamie Dimon. 
Who's also going to be silent about Bitcoin as he declared.
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:46:59
Heh, they could close another exchange at any time and seize $600 million worth of Bitcoins.
