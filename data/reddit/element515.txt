Import tax. Owning a car in China is an impressive thing. A nice car, even more so.

That's also what makes them build post good things. You don't just but the image, you buy how good they make things. You said it yourself, need to maintain that image.

I dismissed doge as annoying too, but now I'm considering if litecoin  will live on over doge..
