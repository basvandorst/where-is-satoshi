Most people are too caught up in the status quo to understand the store of value use case. They disregard thousands of years of human history, which shows that the stability of institutions, governments, companies, careers, currencies, etc. is an illusion. They can't be convinced until their savings halve overnight, their funds are confiscated to pay for the mistakes of gambling bankers, or their previously stable government ceases to exist.
I feel bad for them, because the next few decades are going to really, really suck for people who aren't good at abstract thinking.

tldr; bandwidth improves in both cost and throughput every year.
In my personal experience, I've seen my internet speed increase by more than an order of magnitude over the past decade, with very little increase in cost.

The prevailing order is unraveling. Expect increasing economic and political turmoil.

See what happened in Korea when they floated the idea of a ban. Huge backlash for the guy who proposed it. Petitions calling for him to be fired got hundreds of thousands of signatures within 24 hours. Banning Bitcoin won't be politically viable because people won't tolerate their money being messed with.

Wallets are not people. Many of the richest wallets belong to exchanges, which means those wallets are holding the funds of  thousands of people.

They know that Bitcoin will bring down the house of cards that they've built. Good for humanity, bad for economists and other fake experts.
