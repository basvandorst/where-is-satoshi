Which would still be true if the blocks had increased in size as he also suggested.

Not block difficulty or block reward. Just block size, i.e the number of transactions that can be packed into one block. Difficulty and reward would be similar to what they are now.

Yeah, before an ICO was a thing and people were flooding in just for the money. If you wanted to acquire 5 percent of the entire supply back then it wouldn't have been difficult, but who would want to do something like that?
Totally different situation now.

I don't have a suggestion, I just want to say that you are an amazing human being and a real inspiration. Thank you for your kindness.

 "It is better not to use Segwit until Lightning is ready."
Use Segwit? Don't use Segwit? Segwit is bad without lightning? Lightning is on the way? 1MB blocks are good? Smaller blocks are better? The blockchain is great? Let's make payments off the blockchain?

Top post is currently: Day 4: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like SegWit &amp; order batching are mass adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low. ARE YOU PART OF THE SOLUTION? News: Unconfirmed TX's @ 174K, more exchanges adding SegWit, Core prioritizes SegWit GUI
Yet a core dev is telling us not to use SegWit and I have many downvotes for questioning the lack of consensus.

What if you wait and demand goes up higher?
