@_date: 2017-12-13 23:58:01
I'm confused, I'm doing research on this guy and he seemes to be bringing the focus back to how BTC has failed in its objectives. He clearly lays that out in lots of his interviews. How is he a scammer? I see people touting BTC at this obsene prices and yet not getting any clear value proposition anymore?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:06:21
I'm confused, how is so called higher fees good for its users let alone time lags?

you are acting like bitcoin was just some accident launched with no thought, backing, etc
you are completely wrong. in fact there are strong nsa or cia connections to this. and those guys don't release crap . in fact, the fact bitcoin can be updated to btc 2.0, etc...shows you don't really understand how this protocol works. sorry, but you lost cred to me.

BTC just hit 500 today, you know you missed 200 bucks a coin while you pontificate BS, although its at least well-reasoned.
no one is going to want to use a NSA SPY GRID company like apple, google, Facebook, amazon, etc and their "coins"

if a retail store who sells APPLE IPHONES ( traditionally its been a hot item and people have WANTED to steal them as they have second hand value) steals the money from the accounts of people who bought those specific phones, or even scammed them selling fake iPhones , should we LOOK DOWN on APPLE , ban apple, destroy apple, devalue apple, etc...because of it in the medium and long term?
or SHOULD we put DOWN the store/exchange who made the transaction? 
in fact the fact people are stealing them proves their worth. people steal things or covet things of value.
you are lacking common sense if you don't get the analogies my friend
bottom line is you are bear and just wanting to argue with ANYONE who sees the amazing value of btc

Loads of people fought it and knew exactly what this meant 
U don't need a private bank government could print interest rate fiat free
Look hoss...go find out the real shareholders and people controlling the fed then you  see who the front men were
Find out who the fed of the fed is,,,the bis
Read creature from Jekyll island
Read tragedy and hope, the one key book that proves unabashedly that the private bankers set up the fed , BIS, etc and used power of government along with the unlimited fiat printing press to consolidate control worldwide

i can't find 1 reason a consumer would use this to buy stuff
if that is being a troll I stand guilty
without the capital appreciation and excitement most people would just be using as another potential trade going boom/bust
i DO understand the value as a business
most people live on credit though..and btc is like cash

exactly right as others and myself pointed out. He is either CLUELESS about finance...or is a schill for his own dollar paradigm investments.
which one IS IT buffet blowers?
only an IDIOT would conclude bitcoin has zero value as buffet has done. He is wrong a great many things and just because someone has a good background on things in a sector or in MONEY doesn't mean their argument is valid
its pretty much 100% fact his argument is invalid and thus so is his opinion
if bitcoin gave tax breaks to him I'm sure he would be on the btc train. 100%

I used to believe what you believed at 1200. I told people to sell for now
but back here sub 500 and the market cap here, get in ...no doubts
the market cap will literally skyrocket once big retailers like amazon, get in and hold a % of it. No doubt they will try their own versions maybe as well, but doesn't matter. Bitcoin is the standard now and is universal, not affiliated to the growth or death of any company or country as well
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:57:53

brand new selling pressure into the market not buying
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:13:44
I know
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:08:15
that is a shitty argument  and completely fallacious
first off:
bitcoin is tiny in market cap....not even a truly fair argument to relate the magnitude to begin with....but you asked for it.
2- all types of money laundering, and even official FED cabal criminal activity and money printing occurs on a daily basis and you will never be told its a crime or even how much was stolen. I believe RUMMY admitted on Sept 10, 2001 that trillions were stolen from the Pentagon unaccounted for, etc. Did that crash the USD? NOPE
3- normal people are ripped off daily from scams and petty crimes from their USD...but they go right into the so called "logical argument of yours" that something IS WRONG with the currency or MODE of delivery of it, being physical in all
wake up out of your SHELL man. OPEN your eyes. You are a BEAR..just admit it. 
6 billion market cap and you are on here bashing.

Has anyone here read tragedy and hope by Carroll quigley? It's a book that truly does lay out logically and factually the Anglo American banker conspiracy 
In it he had years to use secret and primary sources 
It's enough to convince brainwashed CEOs who are in reality central banker or wall st slaves
Bottom line is most libertarians have infinitely more knowledge and experience collectively to how the system really affects people 
Anyone who can read this book and not get it should be banned from the country
All the proof u need or seek is there 
When u have infinite money what can't one do?

why is bono at davos...where people like soros and fed governors hang out at?
why has bono met popes?
why has bono pushed for debt forgiveness of countries to the US
also he was at davos in 2008 as things were crashing
why and how did bono get into the Facebook ipo when no one could ( hint - elevation partners look it up)
he is not just a regular entertainer and hasn't been for 15 years or MORE now

first off they are wrong. there is an issuer behind it..the miner's no? then its shut off because the program shut off from creating new coins, thus scarcity sets in
also, there is no need to trust people, like snake oil salesmen like fed governors or worry about money printing, etc
a much fairer market actually

I think you are dead wrong...what little bono KNEW..he now knows...he had 15-20 years hanging around these people after they grabbed him for the LIVE AID crap and blew him up for Joshua and Acthung Baby.  They used him for that whole thing..or he was OK with being used for it. The other fact you completely ignore like a moron is BONO OWNS a Private Equity/venture capital firm. and made a billion off Facebook. you sir know nothing about banking at the level he does. He now knows what mitt romney knows.
the fact is bono danced on stage dressed as a devil. fact. mr maphisto...
what a calling card
He's been knighted
I remember people a decade ago complaining online that "bono sold out"
I know who he sold out too..do u? same f-ing people that everyone is complaining about for decades who has infiltrated every single system out there. 
do you even know WHO the first international bankers were?
I'd guess you don't...because if you did past history would make a lot more sense of who is ruling the world and laughing at us

are you concerned that there is clearly no major benefit for a consumer yet to buy and use btc? let alone tax issues
i mean, most people use credit cards and they do have benefits
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:51:20
i'm saying that is what the elite, big corporations, politicians, etc are already doing. the government breaks the law every second and you don't realize that. its scary.
by all means pay your taxes, I pay mine. But do not fall for the mind control you are in. If it was all clear cut you would just be taxed, end of story. NO ONE would be pontificating on here. our tax system is a game and a scam because of all the  loopholes, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:50:47
so if gold is useless as a currency why give it value?
that is basically what the btc bashers are saying :)

sure bits and pieces of truth are now admitted they can't deny it all now.
what will happen when people revolt agains the fraudulent debt? debt is money...so in reality if you don't pay your mortgage back ever you are not really hurting any one just numbers on a screen

there are people who believe what the state DOES, using violence against people to take their money, etc, is a CRIME.  and also the mantra "pay your taxes or you are a criminal" has been brainwashed by them for 100 years.

2. The government is always right
3. Listen to your government officials

nope, eventually the btc will rise on bad news. being decentralized all of this is mainly hoopla
watch as assets tends to rise eventually up a "wall of worry" once major players have priced in news

Delusional is thinking a 8 billion market cap is a BUBBLE when there are 100s of crap us stocks at that valuation
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:52:39
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:16:51
No you are a statist and brainwashed i would tell it straight to your face
Income is profit and Supreme Court did rule on the definition of it
Many things might earn revenue but not be profilt or income 
U are just repeating like a parrot what you were taught by the mind control 
I dont care but dont expec not to be called out on a bitcoin forum 
If congress can tax anythhing why cant they tax air, etc
Silliness to blindly act like u are trying to help people and repeat the 16th amendenment propaganda.they didnt tax common man wages until ww2!!!! Yet they has all that power yeah right
Use your accounting skills to chsnge the whole system you are in it and u are just profiting off wasteful gaming of resources

a big HMMMMMM
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:31:06

the dollar protocol is already out there and reliant on big banks, ACH, wires, etc
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:15:48
coming from a guy who thinks WB/ BILL gates and oprah are the richest americans I call that a compliment
you are fully delusional in the matrix
btw, BUFFET reaped windfalls via all the financial bailouts
the truth sucks don't it
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:04:52

and bitcoin crashing right now thanks rogan
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:18:02
you are very late at this point. and because everyone is likely going to get into bitcoin in the next few years anyway, the business idea will die
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:36:17
HUGE news...buy all you can 500-600 btc

Best thing rogan has ever said.
Straight up 
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:36:50
if you are truly bullish on bitcoin u should be cheering the death of it here so you can buy cheap
this is how bottoms are made , wake up...with people throwing the towel in and headlines like "death of btc" and mt gox on every financial rag ) as it is)
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:24:53
the same guy protesting at gox in every photo! hilarious...
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:19:47
i disagree here is why. lots of the MEDIA is owned. Many of the journalists are OWNED...meaning they are told to write a biased article, etc
you people giving free passes to reporters are NUTS! they are some of the most well educated people in the world and well trained in the human arts of language and propaganda. anyone working for the WSJ is going to be familiar with finance, stocks, the fed, madison ave, how the economy basically works, etc even if they write a COOKING section.
i am sorry but once you get it thru your head that bitcoin is simply a digital currency, protocol/ledger...its not excusable for anyone to continue to bash like I see on the boards out there and sites like this. They know exactly how powerful this can be.
quite honestly I don't think uncivil people deserve civil treatment in 2014 at this stage of the game after trillions have been used to bail out BANKERS and WALL ST..this reporter works for the WALL ST JOURNAL IN NYC the city OF MONEY...call them out, rout them out
that's how we win. Good luck being nice to people who have an agenda.
the financial interests control the WSJ and many others. They are not independent
they love to play good cop/bad cop as I've said about 100 times here. its a scam. expose it

I agree with you. I know all about Schiller...and he is a fed mouthpiece. you won't see him start a movement to stop the fed from causing these bubbles

stand up
be a MAN
be a WOMAN
when a company or official or "entity" commits Injustice, fraud, or lies, to NOT act at this point in 2014, is criminal IMO
if you are mad at apple, google, the NSA, etc...and you have EVERY right to be, then you have at your disposable multiple tools of the trade as well things they don't want you to even think about

its ludicrous!
the market caps are so RIDICULOUS to compare you should know this

the lower it goes the more its worth to me. again, keep selling
last time people expected 200-300...never happened, i raised my range a tiny bit
around here I wouldn't hesitate to start putting new money in bad news or not.
and continue buying it from weak sheep from there.

yes, but just because someone nailed 1 top doesn't make him RIGHT and unable to be wrong
he is a YALE BOY...and he is ALL about the fiat and protecting the fed. please show me where he has taken his wisdom and used it to change the fed or government from relentless money printing?
you won't find it. he is just a mouthpiece on the trail like many
there are MANY people like the prechter's of the world who NAILED a top along the way and then kept the same prediction and blew it several others times.
appeal to authority is a classic logical fallacy. it worked on you I see

of course, we have been talking about this for a year now...and the NSA/CIA connections as well as the crash in the price right after gavin presented
my bet is they are creating controlled opposition type outlets by design to harden us and the system 
this is very BULLISH and also at helping developers improve it

thank you cowboy....
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:45:06
Yes no doubt....by why are you HERE if you are not involved with bitcoin? you realize the whole point of bitcoin is to get people OUT from under the power of the FED, the IRS, etc right? Whether they pay taxes or not is moot. 
the fact is we have a hybrid voluntary/mandatory system...by design. its the only way things can pass constitutional muster. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:29:33

if the business is legitimate and listed in yellow pages, in yelp, and is well known in the community, why would you assume they are a scam and would screw you on bitcoin as well?
to see if someone is legitimate as a business itself should be GOOD enough to determine other things IMO
the fact that someone would open up a shell company like bitcoin4eggs...well yeah...they are trying cash in on the bitcoin thing
seems stupid. if you have a legit business taking bitcoin is just another payment option
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:52:29
you are in a fraud market with no truth or real transparency..that is why bubbles and busts can occur

exactly, why isn't this type of journalism being used against the current oligarchs, the fed members, the rockefeller/rothschild complex?
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:08:24
He is still a statist 
Not nitpicking, some of us here want to wake up these dam sheeple lawyers and cpas who perpetuate the same system we have when the point of btc is to completely change that
By most of those guys logic, air is taxable or the co2 you breathe out is taxable because congress can tax anything , any source derived, especially if used in  this Grand Canyon term of income 
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:19:01

@_date: 2014-03-27 15:32:27
they are working on it, don't worry
btw i said about 10 times here that the weekly PUMP AND DUMP, good cop/bad cop routine is because the powers that be cannot get in bitcoin without surging it to 10k USD per btc. fact
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:33:46
its not that hard. all your transactions are logged.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:08:43
yup, the bad cop/good cop routine continues
buy all you can down here folks....marketwatch has like 3 articles a day about this 6 billion market cap item..which is so tiny 
they keep pumpin and dumping so big fish can get in....
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:04:50
yeah, but the decreasing ability of it to give great returns will stop usage by consumers
i cannot find one reason why a consumer would use this for normal goods unless products are discounted if they pay btc cash
most people live on credit cards
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:45:39
actually it does MATTER what people think about the state. Why are you involved in Bitcoin if you are a statist? scary to think about all the sheep that might come into bitcoin and ramp up its tracking, etc in some type of orwellian currency.
people have a right to choose how they report their taxes that's just a fact. YOU report, You track, you analyze, you give them the proof, etc. that iS the way the code is set up and you are right, the state then puts the fear of GOD into you to enforce "voluntary compliance"

no new HIGHS have been hit
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:08:39
my issue I will continue to stand by...is what clear benefit does the CONSUMER get out of this?
I see none at this point
most people are living their life on credit and 30 day grace periods, not cash
only if you were an international person needing to be in and out of countries would I see benefit at this point to hold and transfer between it
lots of people pump why business will take it, but if no businesses pass on savings of avoiding the banking system...we might flatline
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:59:29
so when bank robbers steal USD, is that a reason to crash the forex markets?

@_date: 2014-02-17 23:12:18
yes they will. or craigslist, or any # of consulting sites online...
 anyone who is anyone will accept BTC once you explain it

bitcoin is great because there is no trust needed in the exchange.

when is the auction of coins? that would be a great OPP for a large retailer to buy bulk without affecting market prices much...say like an overstock or tiger or whoever like a new entrant. i'm sure some hedgies would want it too
also news out today about banking issues in china as well as growth slowing....one would think some millionaires would be looking into bitcoin again

@_date: 2014-04-01 22:59:11
I look at it this way...the system as is was set up under false pretense to the US let alone the world
The central banks knew that if they could legitimize the racket, they would guarantee infinite profits and place at every table in the world.
there is also a BIS system above the Federal Reserve, let alone tie ins to the UN, IMF, and the various round table/working groups as verified by amazingly researched books like Tragedy and Hope.
The system is designed for perpetual inflation where the insiders or networks at the top parasitically live better off financially, let alone thru social engineering ( which the government programs help with )
We need to empower and educate people at the individual level and get a system back that is PEOPLE centric.  
I was brainwashed in college as a business and finance guy to accept inflation, the FED, social engineering/economic control, etc.  I now see my clueless financial friends parrot the FEDSPEAK without critical thinking. The fact is there are always other ways. Anyone still parroting this are obviously OWNED by the system and profit off of it, or very Naive in how real finance works. Most people still don't know the FED gathered gold from around the world in the early 1900s and sent billions and billions of gold guaranteed US BONDS to other countries. This is the secret history here and several books and recent stories confirm there is a shadow economy of amazing proportions behind the curtain.
BTW When you back out the FED balance sheet expansion and money creation the economy is negative growth for a decade at this point I believe. Karl Denniger has covered this a lot on his blog and book.

You don't get it...You are talking a guy who knows all about the logical fallacies
All the evidence I have researches shows Bono is in as Big a CLUB of the elite..as allowed for a guy of his class. simple as that
he is not just another dude..HE created ELEVATION PARTNERS after being in the biggest grossing band for 2 decades.. HELLO. Wall st was pissed they couldn't get into the FB ipo but bono got in
Bono has regularly been ALLOWED to speak on africa, debt, money, AID. etc..this is the latest incarnation that the OWNED MEDIA will spin on him. I don't care what bono says my bet is HE WILL SPEAK on bitcoin.....in fact I predicted it based on what I see.
Speaking of Microsoft and appeals to authority..why is a guy who started Msft pontificating about vaccines and GMO's the last 10 years like he is an expert? Mr Bill Gates...
@_date: 2014-02-17 23:14:49
i am saying its not the big deal you think it is...find the right vendor...then explain to them about bitcoin
find the right business or people you want to deal with...first
unless you have 100k or 1 million + in btc and are desperate to deleverage out of it... then who cares at this point
its inning 1-2
unless of course you think adoption is about to crash

@_date: 2014-01-03 22:24:26
it was built without wall st and can thrive without it. like I said, the whole point of bitcoin is to set up a new paradigm outside of you people. look man, I have the finance degree and the experience just like you. Wall St ruins all it touches in the end because they are parasites. Only a few % actually do GOOD things and create wealth in the end
we want a new paradigm away from you guys. its common knowledge ETFS, WEEKLY OPTIONS, etc are all ways they hedge and scam the common man out of money in the markets
stop creating derivatives of derivatives. if someone wants bitcoin they can simply buy it right now

yes, it looks for real this time, banks like JPM are about to launch/trial run their own platforms on their own LEDGE...circumventing bitcoin completely. The morons at bitcoin have blown it by hesistating  as I have learned, and now while they are hesitating at making bitcoin a clear leader the BANKS are doing their own thing without bitcoin. I wouldn't doubt this finds its way to retest the 200s recent lows in days or weeks ahead. This last few days is a warning. I'd take SOMETHING off the table while you can up here. Just my opinion,but not good when I see several old timers finally selling 
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:43:32

not sure how you cannot sell some with it vertical up 50% in weeks bro
btc to me is not like it used to be. see less value in it now actually the more it rises as the protocol fails more and fails to serve the expectations. banks are using their own blockchain tech as well, no need for btc
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:37:43

@_date: 2017-11-23 03:50:49
The stories here are exactly what u hear once everyone is widely aware
Better keep breaking highs or watch out below
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:34:46
All of these bitcoin forks and btc are overvalued
Severe damage to the bitcoin brand today that will last
No major company will support
Any btc coin now
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:04:20
Btc is like buying a home in 2007
There is no better time to buy houses then now
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:15:51
Stories and posts like this are always around a top not a bottom
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:37:30
Stop supporting btc and related forks
They are dominated by crazy commie
Chinese miners and gambling asians or anarchos
Eth had hundred brand name companies behind it
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:11:20
apparently the utility, credibility, and decentraliziation case of btc is dwindling 
ironic but yet its not. often things are priced at parabolic highs just as the most irrational things are occuring to actually support that price
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:40:30
Eth is soaring again
New highs coming as people come to my side of things in this debate
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:36:01
People in cold wallets could
Be selling for days to come
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:30:04
14,000 people in this echochamber actually liked this?
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:14:40
Move to eth for that
Btc will die with drama and whimpers eventually
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:30:12
You are done with nothing
Ltc already beat u
Eth will crush u all
U are in a mass hysteria money flow bubble
The fundamentals have shifted away and btc and its forked scams will never recover for years
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:56:25
Already in the works
Btc is unsuable
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:03:12
There will be 4 btcs
I suspect the next crash permanently cripples btc
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:41:38
Omg u guys keep schilling for newegg and btc
Eth has 100 major  companies
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:55:11
800 to 10k in a year
New buyers missed it baggies
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:30:00
when are you and the guys here going to realize btc is controlled by chinese miners and a few vocal wall st types?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:28:00
i thought btc wasn't centralized?? lmfao 
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:12:25
Please read opinions outside this

All real investments pay interest or dividends
Like i thought you dont know the diff between speculative assets and real investments 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:25:19
Yikes dude relax!
If you honestly cannot see how ethereum is a whole blockchain system while btc is one facet of it regarding money then this convo goes nowhere
Btc is full of drama and everyone of sound mind knows that. Lots of cfos and institutional money has been watching as well and learning who deserves that money flow
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:13:51
He is right
We are giggling on the eth board as slowly u people wake up that btc sucks!  Thousands of pending transactions, up to hours to clear vs eth or ltc
U guys drank the koolaid. The fees to transfer money are insane
For the love of money please protect yourself before the chart breaks and u are screwed for years with big losses
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:22:51
Total loss of faith
 Btc looks scammy in all forms tonite
The brand is going down

@_date: 2017-11-12 05:54:47
No large companies will embrace it
U need chinese commie miners to keep your coin up
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:01:28
Its gonna crash
4 btcs
A scam
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:04:54
Btc was 4160 a month ago
Btc is a strong sell here
U got free coin move on imo asap
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:21:55
Btc is trash at this price point for what you get
Only someone neck deep in the bubble can’t see it logically

@_date: 2017-11-12 05:39:10
I speak the truth
This community doesnt remember what it was like when btc was cheaper and wasnt dominated by chinamen
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:02:42
you guys are gonna miss the train
eth burn and pos is coming
to crush your btc dreams
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:29:37
It proved btc is a bubble ponzi
They manipulated it and made tons of moneys and now stopped it
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:19:11
excellent article folks!!!!! this is the  key everyone needs to read!!!! BILLIONS and BILLIONS In value of blockchhain savings just in displacing a portion of DTCC work

Ethereum will receive the most
@_date: 2017-04-20 22:18:40
it is failing...distribution always is quiet when it happens
pro's distribute near highs, not lows dude
@_date: 2017-04-20 22:06:50
its worse than that...most of you since day 1 of bitcoin going mainstream are pumping it, touting it, knowing that COMMUNIST CHINESE investors, radical anarchists, and wall st hedgie/trader scum are in this as well
SHAME ON YOU
wake up
@_date: 2017-04-24 13:20:16
you said a whole lot of nothing
the fact is some fake front guy or group owns tons of bitcoin and is likely CIA
all set with this
all set with people pontificating about how great bitcoin is, how its this and that and meanwhile they won't admit it was CIA created likely if not NSA/ You don't know who your founder is?  Its same as a virgin birth, complete BS and illogical!
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:07:03
looks like it successfully emotionally and rationally retested already...and now resuming/confirming the recent move up
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:54:29
how is it fair if some unknown CIA plant satoshi owns it all? and chinese miners control as well? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:54:47
Btc is toast , heavily reliant on china
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:14:37
Holy sheeet
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:50:37
Buy eth
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:02:22
Yeah its crazy
There are literally billions of slaves on this planet that need to wake up
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:14:31
Ico is one out of many eth apps coming
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:12:30
Btc was overvalued no doubt
Eth will replace it
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:15:58
Eth 
Eth to 2500
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:14:02
I thought the same thing when i saw the news
Still think btc is a sell up here
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:14:58
Never trust china!!!!!
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:03:42
lol, or they accept ethereum and diss bitcoin since 100 other companies that are massive brands, support ethereum
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:52:17
The fools here dont even know jpm supports eth
Wake up btc is toast
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:02:22
Yeah its crazy
There are literally billions of slaves on this planet that need to wake up
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:49:45
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:09:14
Who is the nsa cia or deep state infiltrator?
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:21:27
of course its fake. If they were going to accept a crypto to start it would likely be ETH. LTC might even have a better chance
BTC has no front person, zip, to help interface with the world and with large companies
eth is literally backed by a foundation and 100 companies in amazon's league
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:05:52
What did you expect here? Dude they dont realize russia is joining eth case they are so blind with btc price up here
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:46:27
yes I do, now that its served its purpose and being left in the dust
i also can't stand some of the infighting in your community, lots of anarchos are the worst people to deal with .  You guys are hurting crypto at this point of the game, not helping it, especially with a 3rd split? lmfao
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:56:35
hey turd, what price will convince you to buy, 800?
seriously wake the f up to what is going on
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:06:55
Great news for eth
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:12:30
Btc was overvalued no doubt
Eth will replace it
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:19:31
4 btcs by november means a massive hyperinflation event
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:04:27
Eth baby!
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:11:29
you should have bought ltc or eth man. sorry but btc is like investing in a dinosaur to me
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:32:58
Btc is losing cred and look like adam before the fall
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:47:18
It's nuts. and now that amazon is shifting to a stock that is trying to hit EPS  DOES matter. so this thing should be cut in half easy but this market is rigged and bezos is CFR
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:44:40
it would go to 100k a coin if a significant amount of institutions and people shifted into it as an asset class...i don't quite think most people know how many trillions are out there in worthless assets, etc that need ponzi finance and subsidies to work
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:30:18
hope you bought! 400 soon
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:14:42
its a joke reading some of these comments. LTC is ahead of btc you idiots
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:49:23
yes, no one would ever worry that their dollar is worth 2% less OVERNITE LOL
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:37:52
not sure why people like to badmouth. cs responded to my issues pretty quickly
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:36:37

Strong SELL
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:02:53
he called the top!
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:48:19
Exactly...real bad advice on here
Btc is like year 9 i to its run...its exhausted and new leadership wil overtake it as pumpers sit here
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:10:24
amen brother you nailed it
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:31:04
the joke is falling for the action as a sign of anything anymore....most stocks of well  known companies out there are worth 10s of billions plus all the billions  and billions in bonds and no one bats a lash anymore even though trillions printed by fed
without it market is 1/3. 
at least bitcoin has a real future without subsidies
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:52:12
with crypto we have a very real probability to do an end around these parasites man
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:50:44
btc might be sub 1900 tonite
the momentum is really leaving this carcass. Developers will flee, miners next
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:06:57
thats crazy. btc can't even break 3k. What a fool
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:35:06
lmfao, so true!!!!!! could be worthless
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:53:14
buy everything in sight! btc, eth, ltc
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:02:20
Good luck bro
Btc crashing
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:22:38
awesome....and still WAY undervalued as an asset class

@_date: 2013-11-27 19:51:25
in a bull market....a 10% move from the top is an entry. you have clear entry points
20% would be better
the dips will be less shallow now as this goes upo. you won't see 666 again for example.ever
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:18:20
pull up a chart man..lots of people yet to cash in. there is still time to LOCK it in...
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:14:12
At what price  do the bulls say they were wrong
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:38:51
you are clueless there's only 1 hedge fund or so in this
unless you mean "retail" are the pros...
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:22:04
No it's not. lower courts and fisa courts are allowing this stuff already! do you not think that the plaintiff already LOOKED into the routes you guys are talking about? they decided to go straight to the supreme court for a reason. they didn't even give an legit answer to the rejection.
i can't think of anything more important to the democracy of our country right now.

artificial volatility being created because this is inning 1. seen the same thing in stocks with HUGE potential. market makers need  vol. to accumulate
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:04:34
if everyone is hyped....and this pos can barely break 1000 USD...sounds like a top ?
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:11:46
so true!
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:53:26
agree, fantastic post OP. right on. F apple
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:44:15
i guarantee most of the people bashing have little or no stake. or they SOLD way too early
you guys will be bashing the whole way up as you cling to your old world stock market and 401ks
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:51:35
hilarious! exactly, they will probably just sit and look for illegal ops using bitcoin and confiscate them..and add to treasury or to fed. lol
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:56:43

A world based on bitcoin and discipline means sp500 below 666 again

@_date: 2013-12-06 02:50:28
Great to see libertarians and anarchists ,most of who are in bitcoin, are some of the most moral people on earth
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:37:37
did you pick any up sub 1000 yet?
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:10:38
The people in bitcoin are overwhelming not traders and i have that angle and know how these rats work
Rolling out an eft this early is not bullish ,rolling out to accredit investors is not bullish
 whole point of bitcoin is to get out of the wall st illuminati fraud banking control
They are all siphon and distort wealth and redistribute it with their tools
Saddens me to see it so soon here already being taken over 
Bankers can use the eft to short bitcoin to pennies 
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:53:06
Sorry but basic math demands , yes demands this rises beyond your egos limitations. Trillions in fiat out there and my prediction of 5k is nothing
good nite
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:33:11
last warning..stop stalking me or I am reporting you to every mod. by your own words you have an agenda with me
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:01:26

Yup 15 bil market cap was top
It's now a show me trade
Quark looks better risk reward 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:26:15
exactly, the higher it goes, the more cred it gets..and the less pullback. this is how all markets work..like stocks. once new price levels are reached it becomes sticky. and the % math of pullbacks, etc changes
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:45:22
4. Buy every panic dip
5. Nsa or cia helped fund creation of this so ignore anyone saying no banks or government will allow. Let alone what ben said
6. Ignore the bashers who will be buying at 5k

I can't believe you got 1400 up votes on this. what a joke
a small group of people who have been bearish the last few weeks like me...saved some of you your financial life! you should be thanking dissenting voices being heard. to believe in bitcoin but not in free speech...and feeling the need to squash a negative viewpoint...makes me sick to see
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:47:50
Ethereal, you are killing on here! keep it up
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:56:50
congrats...feels good right?? lots of people NEED to do what you just did to get some clarity and separate emotions before they lose it all
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:35:48
yeah but they ain't buying officially in their hedge funds or client ports if legalese prohibits.

@_date: 2013-12-06 02:09:53
you'd be wrong. pull up a chart. it can go either way here. major st resistance above 1200
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:23:22
any of you folks still watching cnbc...just admit you are a sheep. the shows suck...they are there to herd sheep into overvalued stocks.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:47:59
how you feel today?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:58:27
it could go to 100, 200, etc. its NOT simple at all. people like u will lose all their capital
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:20:43
Its likely nsa or cia  helped at some point in history but at least they kept limited supply and will likely fund their criminal op with it 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:44:41
watch out! most of these new prescriptions, no?
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:19:55

@_date: 2013-12-07 03:39:07
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:39:46
So many bulls need to see people post9'g on how they lost everything

Spoken like a true statist stuck in a statist paradigm 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:08:06
exactly, great idea...and people will realize that buying worthless cheaper currencies is not the best bet. just buy fractions of bitcoin who IS the gold std at this point 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:28:52
well its 15 billion market cap...not like this is 10 million anymore

@_date: 2013-11-29 23:11:36
All u gotta do is basic math my friend
it can get to 100K very easily if any SMALL part of the world puts some into diversify
its not hard to figure out. there is also tangible value in the amount of FEES saved for the next say 30 years..just discount it back
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:51:10
HELLS YEAH
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:50:25
Bitcoin can be used in offline world face to face..not just online
and the scalability does produce massive savings in the end..I just haven't done the math.

Cnbc viewership is at all time lows...,fact
They are desperate to get bitcoin audience

@_date: 2013-11-29 23:56:37
sounds good!
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:35:02
Exactly you proved my point
Most of u in it at investors or businesses
Consumer experience much different angle like getting a bad product or lack of credit grace period etc
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:47:04
you are gonna have to raise your buy levels bud...cat is out of the bag at least for 30% of the small 5% financially aware people in the US and Europe

@_date: 2013-12-19 00:10:35
and the quality of your reply. ouch
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:15:41
you are nuts...they renewed and changed the patent to compete with bitcoin . close your eyes though to the worlds biggest bank threat to btc. i'm not

I'm so bad someone paid for my reddit gold
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:12:15
finally someone who gets it
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:17:02
thank you SO MUCH Displayer.. yes i already got attacked 3 times since this one post. this is a huge deal...for example, coinbase allows checking account funding from a bank. taking that away in china kills the ability to fund and trade it easily.

very positive. also patrick byrne is WELL KNOWN on wall st for exposing very vocally naked short selling and the fraud committed against people every day on the stock market!

what if a majority of the country or world refuse to do business with the banks?
OUR POWER..OUR TIME

what this means is if its viewed as a payment system not a currency replacement...major upside will be ELIMINATED and the whacky 5000, 100K tgts will look like tulip mania again
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:50:14
Its horrible if your system is based on debt
It's not horrible if the deflation builds equity for people or gets them to save money
Its bad for banks and big companies will rely on marginal fiat to ramp their growth 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:44:58
as of right now he called the top...hard to put him down now..he nailed it
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:32:55
Lots of heroes about to lose it all
No reason to buy in this volatility 
Lots going lower the market is warning all
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:56:58
Why are you here harassing me? it's called free speech. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:00:40
i love how businesses and vendors are pumping bitcoin but then fail to realize that the consumer is addicted to credit and a 30 day grace period on a credit card. SALES around the world would crash if people adopted bitcoiin as a real currency
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:20:50
You proved the WHOLE Point of my post! you are so desperate for it to crash you can't stop calling a top and a bubble. seriously, look in the mirror. you are on the wrong side of the trade yet again!

Dude get a life, turn off cnbc 
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:25:59
What is sad is guys like you likewise dont see the ludicrous nature of the fed printing 85 bill if not more a month for years
And yet people pick on btc
Twitter and facebook are extreme bubbles and yellow page directories in the end
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:39:39
apparently you think its bullish the biggest companies in china just dumped bitcoin?

If he is bullish on bitcoin i would listen
Nailed apple top and nailed google at lows
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:10:37
I'm looking all over the boards, et..and people on msm sites keep bashing this too
as i've said before, if you are going to bash it, bash it because it could turn into a technocratic control mechanism of the world. I'm down with attacking that. Otherwise, bashing a bull market trend that's in inning 1 is ludicrous
currency can be worth trillions with broad usage. anyone part of the new money paradigm will ensure they have a fighting chance to make sure bitcoin in not corrupted by the statist sheep and controllers
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:58:16

@_date: 2013-12-19 00:11:47
it was 1000 a few short days ago and people like me said SELL
jesus..and we were attacked
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:10:13
selling your btc at that rip off price at coinbase...no thanks....
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:26:20
Why would u
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:24:34
Some did..govt and major corporations said no in a way
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:24:27
there's a flaw in everything you dunce. All that matters is its 100% true btc is getting mass adoption already
litecoin, etc will all crash and burn in the end 
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:48:23
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:46:14
then you literally do not get it. "they" always MAKE the general population FUND their operations whether thru taxes, prices, subsidies, etc. By having this go parabolic for years..they ensure crytocurrency gets accepted by the masses. No one is gonna hate bitcoin when they are making money on it. 
it's a perfect trojan horse..because liberty people have been right about tons of issues...and this is a solution they usually like. Bitcoin could someday be used in so many different ways including helping the state manage cash transactions. if paper cash goes away, bitcoin could be million/usd 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:08:56
Manage risk
Do not marry this
I see 250
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:14:30
exactly, the bozos don't understand there is a HUGE difference between a currency of exchange/architecture...and a simple asset class 
the exit is the entrance, the entrance is the exit...
alpha and the omega..like i said 100 times here...the ultimate bubble is fiat currency. now this is the perfect asset and bubble as finite supply, and if it becomes the new paradigm there will never be a need to an exit unless you want to convert some to silver, etc
they will figure it out at much much higher prices.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:55:59
that guy no doubt. Quark is going up
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:26:18

Fck the big corporations

Good to hear
Sounds like u wont be that guy who capitulates at the lows 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:11:57
yeah, because it gets clicks...market cap of bitcoin proves no one is in there
ask anyone you know,  most have no clue
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:08:00

@_date: 2013-12-13 18:51:14
yes, no new highs are being hit on all this SO CALLED good news. as of right now I've been right to be bearish and you don't need to track everything I say.
in trading its called things are priced in. as it drops a slope of hope is created...if it doesn't hold here we got problems, if it holds could be in this pattern for months not moving and all the hot money will be so pissed..let alone january is a big profit taking month since almost everyone still holding has massive gains and no exit plan
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:23:39

@_date: 2013-12-07 19:18:23
you'd be wrong. if you can't fund a bitcoin trading account easily with bank help...it's relegated to the cash market and grey market again
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:11:18
true...but won't happen until they take payment IMO
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:27:40
Wromg bankers are attacking now
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:08:34
i'm worried bitcoin bulls have bit the hook line and sinker and believe they already won
the haven't
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:50:26
Stock market traders would know it
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:50:54
hence why they can go after the people or businesses using it

please stop harassing me and spamming me this again
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:31:50
look at the market cap and transaction/vendor growth. then you can stop relaying that stupid tired saying. this is not a stock. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:25:51
HE FELL for the Y2k hype. nothing happened...not even 1% of 1% of an issue
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:05:40
this is going much much higher...because all of the risks you mention, everyone knows and has priced in
have they priced in china telecom, baidu, paypal/ebay, or amazon yet? not even close
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:22:42
went straight up 200 from lows after i posted and now down 100 from top come on man. take responsibility for your trading
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:31:14
HA HA
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:06:26
yup...awesome huh...especially since the world is huddled for 100 years and more , into paper assets.

Heralding a new age 
Enrich yourself with 
Knowledge 
And act before its too late
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:56:07
I think trading BTC for another crypto currency would be viewed as a like kind exchange...When will the IRS come out with guidance? or will they at all any time soon? world is locking down cayman accounts, etc...this is like the last place the elite could defer taxable gains, etc as it IS a grey area no matter how many accountants say there are taxable events here.  The state has no control of cyrptocurrencies from a tax standpoint IMO. they can only  say they do. a like kind exchange to me looks like no taxable event...i'm sure they are looking at allowing that..so their rich buddies don't pay taxes on it
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:17:57
other alt currencies are dead now as popular talking heads like PAUL weigh in....millinos of fans

darkwings..you proved the point..you are jealous as hell! admit it
you guys are gonna continue to miss the boat because your ego and you dig in
the price could go to 10 million someday if they want it too. stop fighting what is so obvious to see here.
prices get sticky ...u might not see below 900 ever again....and once 2000 is breached think 5k happens even quicker

@_date: 2013-12-19 15:06:45
I agree..magical thinking is actually believing in the government and government backed fiat currency at this point. You can tell your friends I think he's a sheep if he doesn't get this point
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:02:08
i think ltc is dead....
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:59:26
the transaction usage overrides the need to have this go parabolic and trade like a stock, etc
it could mean the protocol survives but the monkeys pumping 10k, 100k, 1 million, look like fools
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:56:18
Not at all i criticized it at first
Volume shows heavy btc accumulation on dips
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:07:34

extremely bearish news

You said that last time
Now we are at all time highs with half the euphoria
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:51:58
right, exactly. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:33:28
people will spend it when it gets to fair value...with .0001% of the world in this...how soon is that?
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:38:15
10000% agree
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:20:10

this just guaranteed bitcoin doubles a lot quicker than i thought..
good cop/bad cop routine by Paul and Greenspan. both  huge rand followers...and both know decentralization is good for people except one can't admit it
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:00:17
they didn't do anything to elevate btc really
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:37:35
bitcoin is never going to displace the credit card market as long as banks exist.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:39:13
One more time dude, and u will be banned 
U are warned 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:45:23
believe it or not...I have the facts. Currency markets are infinitely bigger than stock markets. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:29:49
To bail out winklevoss and rich friends
U are 100% correct
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:20:35
I can't post there for some reason and no mod will help
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:27:50
every CRASH from here is the biggest buy of your life
pray for a crash and this thing cools off
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:25:50
Please happen again
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:07:34
This guy is very questionable and like many of you..you have have gone to business insider.com and there are LOADS of CLICK BAIT articles. They only make money off eyeballs...you know like in the 99-00 dot bomb bubble and crash. in fact the owner of the site is henry blodgett and even Jeff Bezos of Amazon has a stake. they are ALL BUBBLES. 
Lastly, this guy is calling a 3-4 billion market cap in total Bitcoin worldwide a BUBBLE? that is literally INSANE! I can find you 100s of Stocks who are not offering anything break thru, etc and trade much higher than that.  This guy defends wall st and the bubble market cap of stocks and bonds worldwide on a daily basis...and Can't see the truth in front of his faith. A massive bullish move is happening in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:32:40
Agree which is why i said bitcoin is a tool but nowhere near what needs to be done
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:23:44
I never said that, i said replacing belief in humans or government or religion  with a belief in computers is creepy as hell as well
Not only that but it's exactly what the technocratic elite want..bitcoin to be the new religion or anti statist statism
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:57:21
not a troll. a troll is someone like you just waiting to JUMP on real people who have real opinions or things to say...and you are wasting my fuckign time. good BYE
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:08:36
Very bullish to see all the people who still need converting
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:11:15
If u believe in bitcoin it cant breach today's low again ior my tgts are in play 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:51:24
i'm in for the collapse of the dollar to .001 cents
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:54:31
I have no doubt in 10k, 50k someday. This is a once in a lifetime bull ride where you get to be part of a new money architecture paradigm.....and experience the capital appreciation at the same time. really, the guy who said this was akin to being able to buy some fraction of the federal reserve system in 1913, nailed it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:23:23
the btc has the biggest market cap...litcoin is going nowhere in the elite's eyes
big boys need liquidity to even consider
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:04:53
so far i'm not seeing many stories...need to see lots of PAIN posts before a bottom
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:43:08
U are looking backwards like most in this thread 
Government fiat is on the decline
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:55:50
How much is government spending
How much is propped by infinite QE, corporate welfare, social welfare, etc
A huge chunk if GDP is fake and reliant on dumb consumers

I lived thru it dude...there was NO GROUNDBREAKING manhattan project and of 10s of billions of dollars spent to avoid a doomsday or something
the guy was dead wrong...he thought it was the end of the world
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:41:02
Good, I hope they laugh. they won't be laughing at 6666 per usd.
anyone who ANY financial sense at all can SURELY realize that stocks, bonds, etc...let alone a banking cartel/empire..can't exist without an acceptable CURRENCy. that currency can be worth INFINITE amount when all they do is print more and more per day and month and year as our fed has done especially last 50 years..and went parabolic the last 10
I think the chart of bitcoin will continue to go up maybe even 100k, 250k..before most get what is happening as even a mere 1% of worlds wealth transferred into this new gold std will make many millionaires ...and people in this really DO DESERVE to be the new millionaires for the foresight and for being right. Central banking cartel is an old paradigm of parasites. anyone who accepts that, even if BTC is just another nwo trick, deserve to be the sheep they are treated as.  I believe the btc rise is also forewarning about a currency collapse next few years..somewhere...

HAHAH the guy who is not in btc is posting non stop on it! 1 link karma trick poster! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:50:57
his whole show is about bitcoin now. lame...the thing is he will pump and pump because he has a position at like 1 buck along with everyone on the show
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:25:43
Could grind down there in weeks
Lots of bulls still
Few bears
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:10:19
U lose by thinking this is a sure thing
Lots  still believe that they will magically be rich off this at any price
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:18:56
this is what i feared..people said no don't worry..and now we have confirmation
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:39:49
not good...that means people who want to crash bitcoin or manipulate it beyond normal supply/demand...will now have an extra tool
fuck me
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:03:12
looks like wall st is in., not that bullish anymore
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:02:13
its not really abstract. asset prices, including bubbles, most DEFINITELY follow psychology phases like this. the greater fool theory is a real phenomenon 
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:04:19
This guy makes me want to load up on bitcoin not sell it
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:00:25
yes, I agree..the higher prices means more liquidity for bigger sharks to continue to move money in. no where close to the peak
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:06:51

@_date: 2013-12-21 15:24:07
Disgusting to see
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:33:35
The article proves that new currencies by people sick of control is nothing new
Alignment with history as nothing is different this time
This kills the bubble argument as well
Thhat is bullish
Also it didnt mention dollars off the gold std about 40 years now which is the end life of most currencies due to debasement
So this is the catalyst of why btc would show up 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:32:35
I'm concerned with all the people calling BTC a bubble...but then ignore the other 80 crap crypto currencies..and no one is warning them
at least BTC has earned it and has rich people in it supporting it
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:38:37
of course bro...this is the reason people are leaving these stupid ass banks!
they continue to justify why people will continue to leave. pay nothing in savings accounts and harass you. LOL

@_date: 2013-12-13 18:56:25
thank you for being honest. but what price does BTC have to drop to before you realize you were wrong, that its not wise holding?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:15:23
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:16:51
not good if he thinks its another napster. napster is history
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:39:13
Thhey used bernanke to top the thing
Now its crashed back to a nice entry
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:45:14
he called the top to the day....
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:06:46
and yet, that is exactly what gives it a DIFFERENT market and risk/return
its dirt cheap in beginning years and will appreciate greatly in future. and actually USED and afford by people unlike bitcoin bubble
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:37:04
Put the connections together...Did you not know he's a bleeding heart liberal turned capitalist? He is as rich as any billionaire you read about now. Most don't know. He will help make Bitcoin even more sexy for the masses...they are all in 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:03:37
if I can save someone money...to stop them from panic buying here..and take some time to sit back...I win.  There is NO RUSH to buy here anymore. the MOMO has ended and the chart shows a classic parabolic chart that is now breaking. it can easily break MUCH LOWER. why not relax all and wait- see what happens. As I said you can always BUY BACK.. but if you are buying high 2 days in a row...you are catching a knife and will be selling at the lows while the banksters buy there because they are patient
that is assuming bitcoin is here to stay of course. it could crash to 200s and stay there for a year. who knows..
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:10:40
what are you thinking then?
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:49:34
good one! Patrick also exposed the bankers illegal naked shorting schemes and how the SEC is completely OWNED
get your money out of stocks up here
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:29:55
and the price crashed on this. because he says 1300 is the top and cap on btc for a long time unless more major things change from here...old news
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:19:20
Accordong to every bubble before 250-300 could be a perfect reset capitulation. Then bankers would support
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:21:19
U nailed it
And that's why i hate them right back
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:15:30
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:11:25
I've noticed lots of imminent bitcoin death news the last few days...the chart looks great here IF it can hold above 500
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:19:00
why didn't you man? coin base is one of the best

Erik destroyed the case people made for dumping btc
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:38:03
7-1 downposts..because people are married to their trade. not a good sign if bullish. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:13:42
OUCH....like i said, remove your bids if you are still bullish...let the winklevoss dudes sell at the bottom and you can buy from them.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:45:01
I actually agree with you it about adoption. That has been my last few points recently. It is very conceivable this goes DOWN for months....while gaining adoption by merchants or consumers. That is because things are priced in before the manifestation when it comes to asset pricing. 
Like I said before its a tuff road for Bitcoin if the price goes DOWN and adoption tops out or more countries like china warn/ stop it penetration. most people are sheep you know this...so if government like France, etc says don't use it its risky, adoption slows. In my strong opinion what china just did will slow or stop adoption for now. dam right you are stupid to pay over 1000 after that until we do the time.
Like I will say again, i do understand all your points I WILL NOT PUMP this to people after this parabolic move. If you still believe in this I guarantee you will have shots in next few months and years to buy cheaper. there is no reason to right now after a 10000% move or whatever it is. dumb money has been buying above 900 IMO. god forbid the IRS comes in and taxes this at 50%, etc...could be a RUSH to lock it in. again, its vapor unless you have converted to FIAT. I hate fiat but you folks are delusional who hate fiat, then RIDE bitcoin down to 200 and puke up your btc, meanwhile you use fiat daily. LOCK IT IN so you can sleep and think clearly again. 
you better consider that if the price tanks to 300 that could be a headwind for adoption down there. especially if the news backs it
if no new news comes out like a ban, etc..then buying panic selling where everyone is bearish will be a good entry.
I am saying bitcoin is a momentum trade right now...when they break, get out of the way. you are seeing signs of it cracking so that is Why I am super bearish. I don't see MANY like me so I am not changing my view. most people are super bullish and up 10000% and refuse to sell. that is INSANE. same thing happened in 99. greed. people bought apple at 700 and it was cut in half . and nothing really bad happened to apple. with bitcoin lots of things can go wrong its not a company. people might just get sick of it like a fad, etc or realize they want credit cards. and merchants pumping this might not like that but look at it from other sides. I think btc is great as a transfer method worldwide that's the biggest thing I like about it. not really as a currency
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:41:18
Thank u haha
Are you worried its gojng to 300 cuz i think it can go there easily
Also consumers are brainwashed to use credit and use the 30 day grace

U are seriously out of your MIND. even in the great depression 70% of the country worked...just like in our mini depression in 2009+

there's no rational reason to think that dollar will last forever either...in fact most currencies are dead in 50 years...
smart people are moving into this escape valve called bitcoin. and notice they are doing it now right with stocks at highs and infinite qe being priced in.

You must be completely under the spell of another dictionary. All a fallacy is is an logical error in thinking. Whether something is physical or non physical, there is productive physical INPUT costs on almost everything. Even now as you live and breathe..it costs Something to think and type. there is something tangible backing everything in the physical world including the output on this screen you are reading, which is just light and pixels.

not if history rhymes..never buy all at once. trade lesson  anyone going all in at one price thinks they are god..and that is nuts. NO ONE knows what the market will do unless you ARE the market maker with unlimited money.
I am sure more stories like yours will show up on days and months ahead. investing in this vs paying rent? nuts..

@_date: 2013-12-06 21:01:35
its looking like a classic bubble cracking the last few days...250-500 is implied descent
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:34:54
many people are mystified because they don't get that this is a CURRENCY architecture....its not like a traditional bubble on a typical asset like tulips, stocks, etc.
this literally is the ultimate bubble...like every currency is. it can go on decades 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:56:41
the dollar is the bubble. guess where bitcoin will be once the masses realize it?
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:23:32
Never buy day one or 2 after a bubble starts to crash.l.this was 100 late aug

@_date: 2013-12-04 20:06:03
its just the opposite. in fact anyone in bitcoin doesn't care about others opinions.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:33:58
he's out of his mind, as usual. 
the stock market is a bubble, and so are currencies..currencies are especially a statist PONZI scheme.
yet he can't admit that....
the exit plan for bitcoin is to have it become so well used you don't need to exit.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:45:58
it is actually a real improvement unlike most alts . someone bashed it as a scam because they got very afraid it could catch on
it now is... crypto and will unseat litecoin in the end

i know what fud is but u are nuts if you think this is ALL fud 
if businesses pull out, like we have seen, and you can't fund an account easily, its pretty much on the down low over there for now

dude, could go to 100k easy if a small % of worldwide cash goes into this
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:45:03
the facts that 100s of people bash quark without knowing about it, like i did, proves it all.
you have all fell under a spell by someone or group of people who looked at quark and got scared
trust me, most alts are nothing special. quark actually DOES improve things including speed of transactions
and that is why market cap is now 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:42:42
bingo...you don't need any state or authority in this...and hence the dip is bought

if you say this is bullish news today you are nuts....i can see letting the china government news pass for a few days..but once companies take action and deny bitcoin..that is BEARISH

I think I need someone who understands and can at least attempt to build or find people to build the a similar or better code to bitcoin..and applications. I got some of my own contacts but I'm not plugged into this hacker community at all. Cryptocurrency is absolutely the correct conduit to allow this to exist. I have no doubt this could be worth billions

I said sell some above 1100. that IS helping people dramatically. I posted multiple times...cause I was serious. I also said do not wait for KEISER, STEFAN, ETC to tell you to sell. they won't
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:19:54
Can u believe me guys yet
Every dip in btc is buyable again 
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:10:51
It's because they know and see the cats out of the bag
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:14:55
nothing but bad news coming now..and market cap of btc has to go down..wouldnt be caught dead in the other cryptos after this
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:13:10
I don't need to analyze anything...I already did. i said 250-300 could happen weeks ago
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:17:12
If are in sell mode, sell in tranches..just like if you buy.
so every ramp up, you would take some off. again, it has a lot to prove from here to get screamingly bullish again. and that is my point.

does it really matter ?
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:28:14
I don't think they are unfounded at all. I also don't think just because you deal in bitcoin that you are really "changing" anything .  If you wanted to infiltrate the liberty movement, you'd create and control the alternative. You'd let it prosper for a while and suck in your worst enemies and dupe them. That said it has positives no doubt. It's just not a cure. in the end private entities who control the most bitcoin will be able to manipulate the price at will..and having scarcity guarantees they can corner market faster.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:17:31
hello all check out the guy with 1 link karma. 
he bought at 1200 and posts non stop against anyone bearish on bitcoin. a total flake who always needs the last word.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:59:04
looks great 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:26:42
sure..but like the USD is today, BTC will be to the others...more breadth...and the master-coin and thus more highly valued
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:45:09
how you know its fake???? people came forward to say it was real

@_date: 2013-11-29 17:36:51
the fact he is comparing bitcoin to STOCK in a company says it all! completely irrational. Bitcoin is akin to creation/innovation of the internet
it's not a business. it's an architecture. it has limited supply as well. Stocks do not. Fiat Currencies do not. he is just another jealous person who  missed out...all he covers is negatives...and never points out the  positives. again, just like stefan M talked about..the shiffs of the world refuse to see the positives nor to put a value on that. they are ALL still in a 100 year old FED induced money paradigm.

You are also wrong on the manipulation. its simply not BIG enough market cap wise to allow massive "manipulation" 
yes the bots are in this but its small fry money

And yet people are so greedy and wont sell
It was 100 in late aug
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:55:05
 This is a once in a lifetime bull ride where you get to be part of a new money architecture paradigm.....and experience the capital appreciation at the same time. really, the guy who said this was akin to being able to buy some fraction of the federal reserve system in 1913, nailed it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:33:51
You are way off. i have almost 20 years understanding them! 
please don't pontificate unless you know my knowledge and background. this thing will go up for years..its inning 1 of a bull market of a new asset class...digital currency. stop living in the past paradigm of death and debt and the FED.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:18:16
the people who didn't sell at 600 the other day..shold be looking to sell some here
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:37:42
not theoretical at all! this chart plays out MANY times a decade in various assets! I am sure big corporations will not be accepting bitcoin after this crash. when its known, what price will btc be at?
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:06:46
you are also woefully ignorant of the real banking system and shadow bannking system and the trillions involved.
banks are warning they could charge people to have cash at banks.
i am telling you, if that happens, this is over 100k easy and quick
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:35:18
It's going 250-500 before this is over
The moves are a massive warning and yet bulls hold on
More losses coming

Terri, you see why I am excited? plus if this is the nwo currency they will bring it much higher than that..much
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:57:19
you are comparing a stock to a new digital currency at like .0001% of the planet knows about? You're out of your mind...
if there is any "crash" you should be running to BUY. this is not going away. 
i don't call a 10 billion market cap brand new asset a bubble. I can point you literally to 100s of 1-10 billion stupid stocks trading out there right now with nothing close to the potential of this anyway
You really don't understand what's going on here. the NSA/CIA helped create and push this...and also as safety valve currency for their elite friends. they will drive this to infinity if they want too. Believers in bitcoin like winklevoss guys have their OWN exit plans like ETFs, etc where they will be able to hedge. trust me, you have no idea how wall st works, I do.

you guys are way off if you think bitcoin will take on the credit card market at this point!
first off...MANY people , even if not in debt, use CC's to get that 30 day Float..its like a cheap or free loan
don't see btc attacking that any time soon so sorry to say. 
Again, lots of wild eye predictions but if you can't see WHY consumers would be reluctant to give up credit cards...you have no basis to judge anything. most people are broke
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:31:38
how come there are 100s of posts like this in the last few months and reddit community continues to allow?

you are refusing to invest in the internet of currency. and that is what will make you DESTITUTE in the new paradigm for currency

@_date: 2013-12-07 02:39:24
Yup. Banks will make sure of it

and honestly...bitcoin NEEDS to cool down.
the fact that everyone is going crazy about it and even ron paul and Greedscam weighed in proves its out there in the worldwide public consciousness..risk/reward is now towards SHOW ME
SHOW ME this can break 1300 with volume and conviction and I will tell someone to buy with fresh money. not now though

bittorrent is meaningless for most of the world that is my point. if same happens to bitcoin the ludicrous pumping of 100k, etc will be exactly like tulips

why would you want to buy the dip when they are killing the upside?
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:55:07
you mean like how they crushed napster? and torrent, etc are so MInizmied in the end... the big corporations always win when people believe in government
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:10:38
this has no emotion involved...a wall st firm put on a very real number of 1300 MAX at this point in time..btc has sold off above 1200 several times now as if that is resistance
if it doesnt make new highs from here...we will have a NICE retracement and grind down.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:07:47
800 dollar is irrelevant. the market CAP is what matters, along with usage
I can find you 100s of stupid stocks right now with 5 billion plus market caps that the Banksters support. Truly you sound uneducated 
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:59:33
no threat...that means they can all call each other up and ram this up for years...they will eventually sell a little here and there..or hedge with a btc etf.
stop worrying
if you knew how rigged the stock and bond market was.....
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:02:10
very easy...and can hedge with the bitcoin etf, etc
also each day it gets easier and easier as 1000s of people around the world wake UP to it

@_date: 2013-11-28 15:22:06
litecoin looks like the bubble..its not going to get big penetration and yet market cap assumes that. 
one big retailer or name takes btc again...and its not good for ltc, etc
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:05:14
its use and value doesn't depend on banks...
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:56:24

@_date: 2013-12-07 17:05:45
that's a problem for you techie and math guys I get. There is a thing called psychology and this chart shows the phases one goes thru. Things can rise much more than real value, and they can crash below fair value as well. Over the long term things even out to fair value at any given phase.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:01:35
yeah, but they use points 1-4 to manipulate it...so u could be waiting years to make money on silver again as people love fiat and the elite love pumping fiat 
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:43:09
the market cap is still small dude...before "the public" is in it will be too late for them
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:31:28
that's the way I take it too! people have it back-wards!!! ass-wards!
we don't want the BANKS involved in bitcoin at all that's the whole dam point of this currency. we don't want their manipulation and spec shorting, etc as you pointed out as well
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:07:04
the market cap says its being adopted. if you can't see that I don't know what to tell you
and vs others...this is literally the only one with a chance of mass adoption at this point
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:16:34

20 cents for a quark and you think its a bubble? bitcoin is the bubble
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:37:18
I see both sides thats what you don't get. I was cheering just like you when the chart was going up, it now looks broken and I don't want to cost people moNEY if this really does break down after a parabolic x 10 move
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:08:18
what about the PAPER DOLLAR? it has no intrinsic value either. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:27:25
yup..the question is how long do they hold off on it? they might allow a window their crony millionaire friends to make billions before irs ever enforces anything. They could take this up to 100K easy
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:36:28
Not impressive
There is no liquidity dude this aint IBM 
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:10:11
For all we know china wants it cheap so they can accumulate away from usd and price was too parabolic they hate bubbles there

you are being too kind..they are creating it to allow an easier escape plan to build their own wealth as the dollar falls. staying in the bubble stock market won't work forever....notice how bitcoin is really going up as the stock market sits at highs being propped up on no volume daily. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:40:00
too bad the public is not in yet..no ONE of any net worth is really IN yet. LOL

@_date: 2013-12-06 20:14:55
possible. i think 250-500 range
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:19:04
and check out the comments on BI..almost everyone posting negatively to his post...and want bitcoin to go down, etc.
sorry folks, not even close to a top

yes, and bulls might have to come to terms with reality about bitcoin as well. 100k targets being pumped when it can't even break 1000 at this point says it all

not only that but because its so cheap there is not enough liquidity for the fiat elite fraudster kings to get in. Clif High was right!

@_date: 2013-11-29 23:45:31
i think you are missing a big point...the FED chairman bernanke, Baidu, and many other things have changed and justify that the price of btc is too cheap. the downside volatility is going to disappear. When you get a 10% correction intraday..take it for gods sake. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:18:16
as liquidity and market cap goes up....it will continue to attract more and more for a store of wealth
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:43:27
yeah old news..why you think its a 15 bill market cap not 10 mil
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:00:13
coinbase doesn't work like that..its an online wallet for bitcoins based on what I have found. so it kind of works like a bank account
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:47:52
yes, the E-Dollar is here with a vengeance with every penny, quarter, dollar, and credit card I take out of my pocket. But you know everything right? I sure don't. My research shows this platform could ultimately be exposed and manipulated somehow whether thru algos that bid up, or down the price. its perhaps happening now on this run to retest the highs...same as the stock market which is prone to manipulation on a 85 billion a month scale..and yet you or your friends don't care about it because you all have 401ks.  ( you are in masses)
I am skeptical...and no its not beyond technocratic control at all...it is not going to 20, 50, 100 billion in market cap without these scum in DC wanting backdoors and controls. that is what i fear. You are looking at Bitcoin today and assuming it will stay that way. it won't. this is a testing ground IMO.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:48:39
everyone should be reporting these scum bags...lets put them all on a Blacklist

I can use a cc to buy from amazon and get 30 days to pay it why pay with cash or btc 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:57:11
I am very sure it can happen
Check out ,u posts where i warned people above 1100 to sell if 1200 doesnt break hard up
Warned of a bit crash 
It now looks like a real bubble now
250-300 into fear and loathing would reset things and make bulls get a grip on reality
300 is stil 3 times higher than late summer 
There is no rush to buy
Broken chart and real bad news happened
If more comes?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:21:03
there is something to say about black-markets though...for example, what happened in prohibition?
feds are allowing this to exist...its bullish even though a lot of us don't want these creeps involved and hijacking it.
i think these technocrats are in bitcoin and will push it for years...and even pay interest someday to force the world in it
but tracking will be a part of it
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:01:22

merchants can pump btc all they want but the fact is consumers enjoy credit cards
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:08:35
me too...I have posted some of the best opinionated posts on this board as well
let me sum it up for you
bitcoin is NSA/CIA backed as well as Bilderberger backed
it's going to the MOON by design and buying in is like buying a small piece of the FED in 1913
if someone wants to argue with me, you are literally insane or haven't done the research to the degree I have
either way, those people's OPINION is wrong. PRICE matters. the price is going up. there is no reason for it ever to pullback again as not even 1/100th of 1% of the worlds savings and cash accounts have moved over a tiny bit yet
watch market cap and transactions for signs of success and adoption
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:05:39
exactly, he's still a moron. all he has to do is look on this site, 1000s of people posting their goods

why pump when clearly the facts have changed here guys. amazing. ride to 500? 300?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:19:53
exactly you nailed it. by owning bitcoin you can get capital appreciation as part of the new world currency
someday code /overlays could pay interest on your investment as it becomes globally accepted

the fact that these posts are all over the place the last few days CONFIRMED it was a BUBBLE

LMFAO...hence why everyone is bashing and calling it a bubble. they know its going higher
if it crashes to 300s again i hope you will finally buy
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:58:12
Me too, looks like lite coin is the bubble
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:09:47
me too, i'm not parting with these things for dirt cheap money. if 1% of the world's cash and savings reserves were diversified into this..how about 1/2 of 1%, where would it trade
anyone selling is completely unaware of math and the greed out there as-is
we got trillions in currencies, bonds, and stocks at 2000 valuations again like FB/LNKD..but people are short selling this in inning 1

That guy really nailed it!! Everyone should see 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:18:30
because adoption partially hinges on the prices going up and getting people to seriously look at it as another currency. people don't get attracted to things in the gutter
also, for big money to take this seriously, we need to be at 100 billion market cap. its not liquid enough now, that is part of the reason for volatility. there is nothing crazy about this at all. 
with the NSA/CIA and Bilderberg connections, wouldn't doub they drive it up for years. Avg Currency Life Cycle is about 50 and US is way overdue...fed found ways around it with going off gold std, fasB accounting tricks/ scam in the market in 2009,perpetual war and pillaging, etc. the moral std of this country is complete shit now just look at the walmart bs today
the elite know they need to corral folks like us into this along with them. be part of the new currency or DIE with the old world currencies
how about the other 200 countries out there? there are trillions out there beside the US.
there are more anarchists and liberty people being created today then ever before..this is a way to get us all on their team. I know it, do u?
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:53:24
It could go sub 250'even 100 to go back to original breakout points

exactly the higher it goes, the more people will come in as the higher price has credibility/popularity. people dreaming for 500 again are nuts
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:33:27
you can't price bitcoin at 20, 30, 50 billion like some of you want yet...
bitcoin market cap has priced in a lot..that is why you hear someone else famous talk about it every day this week
the big money was made for now
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:42:59
its true...if you already missed it at 5, 100, 500...that IS the reason you buy here..you see it really is going to change the paradigm 
the only people bashing here are people who don't get it and are jealous
if you believe there is a crypto bubble...bitcoin is the one who you want to be in though..litecoin, etc are the ones who will crash hard and not hold their value because btc has first mover advantage
I believe people will be calling this a bubble all the way up to 50k

I am agreeing with you...bitcoin is not V 1.0. this is a long time in the making. they rolled it out almost perfect. this is the chosen currency. join or get run over IMO. no one knows about it. at 100 billion with Facebook, people will know. but they won't be able to afford 1 btc
i disagree that they shouldn't get in on any pullback. currencies around the world are being destroyed and it has taken decades for the sheep to wake up. when that herd runs and buys much much higher....a decentralized cloud based p2p digital currency with no money printer at the helm...is sexy as hell
can go to 100k easy in years ahead.

Number 8 is very real
People could speed up usage of bitcoin for transactions and stop playing the cap gain bubble game
If u want btc to succeed u should pray for no more bubble action or btc etfs

@_date: 2013-11-29 18:40:48

@_date: 2013-11-30 06:13:16
No ramblings utter truth
World is waking up to the fraud perpetuated on us
I never said out all your money in this not once
What is your  target.
I still think inning 1-2 here
People who missed it are jumping into all other alt coins. I think u should be warning them about a thing called best of breed and penny stocks 
Market cap of btc says who is winning

Most of the intellectuals are rational
It either took one a few hours or a few weeks to realize it could take off
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:58:30
It will save billions in transaction fees over current fiat
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:14:26

@_date: 2013-11-30 05:52:37
It doesn't ...but the current fiat currency model is way more expensive to transfer internationally for example

same as gold etf. they are there so people can SHORT it and hedge
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:46:34

@_date: 2013-12-07 05:42:46
A man no one knows with potential cia ties created bitcoin and quark is the scam?
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:58:26
Hi maine, I agree with much of what you said. the whole run up in bitcoin looks to be chinese speculation mainly. I'm looking for the next 100+ crash in bitcoin before thinking of more. but who knows.
  I don't believe it can't be backdoored in some way. They said the same thing at Google, Apple, etc. hell even the NSA said it..all can be compromised IMO if technology is involved. 
And I do think it WILL be backdoored by design in the future..or done in the OPEN...or even easier...NSA can just tap into all the bitcoin wallet accounts, or sniff out the particular codes via the net that lead to an IP. Most people are not going to be able to hide every trail. But really there is nothing wrong with bitcoin its a tool anyway. These statists will just use it to further the agenda in time...and the liberty loving folks who ate it up hook line and sinker won't believe it...like yourself. I just want people on guard. Doing everything in Bitcoin is not a full SOLUTION to reclaiming our liberties. And just because someone accepts bitcoin doesn't mean they are a liberty loving, valuable person to do business with. That's why i created my site to connect all in the movement.

@_date: 2013-12-19 04:24:40

Huge volume last few days 
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:40:31
I respect this guy immensely. don't agree with him..but he he even closed his short seller fund in 2009 or something and just reopened. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:25:20
give me a  break
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:37:30
looks like a bull trap....selling has stopped for now and people are chopping themselves trading it...when they realize its not gonna resurge back to 1000 any time soon next wave of selling comes.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:44:06
They pumped and sold the lie
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:59:23

@_date: 2013-12-07 05:37:39
Your cost is not impressive to me that should say something
A troll is someone bragging about money but booked nothing
Vapor profit is not profit

@_date: 2013-12-05 21:59:22
price matters..watch as it falls back in weeks ahead if momentum doesn't increase from here. simple trading 101 and psychology.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:40:15
