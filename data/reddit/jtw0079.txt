There's only so much I can warn about. I'm also new to bitcoin. My stocks are primarily on KOSPI, which means they're particularly vulnerable right this minute. I'm holding them expecting a recovery, but in the meantime, I bought into bitcoin about a week or so ago, and I'm impressed with the growth. My comment was more of a show of solidarity to a fellow newbie and my personal experience rather than actual financial advice. Maybe my wording was poor. 
I am absolutely not an expert, my interest in bitcoin started when my stocks took a hit from the "fire and fury" comments, which was about a month or so ago. It's possible that I've made a grave mistake buying in at this time, but if so, I don't know it yet.

What do I have to gain? Just sharing my experience so far. Of course there's risk involved and it helps that I'm patient and like to hold my investments. There's definitely some types of people who would have a hard time with the volatility of cryptocurrency.

I bought just a 150 dollars worth last week or so and I was at 165 last night. That's a 10% increase in less than a month, compared to 5% on my stocks and funds from January or my 2% from my savings account. I'm pretty impressed with the return so far. I'll definitely be putting a portion of my investments in BTC from now on. I wish I started a couple years ago, but I guess today is the second best time to start

I don't even have a 401k option, but rather a national pension (that I can't opt out of) so a portion of my income goes to that anyway. I'd feel iffy devoting my whole portfolio to bitcoin, so I'm still putting some into my index funds, but being willing to shoulder more risk could definitely bring you more returns

You can take a train from Russia into North Korea and they have flights from Beijing. They're closed off, sure, but not exactly under siege
