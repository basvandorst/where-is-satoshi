That professor is a moron lmao. If he knows this. He would take all of money out of those retirement bullshit(which will most likely be “obsolete” soon regardless of bitcoin and funnel it into btc. Especially a year ago when it it was 5% of the price.

Lmao. Because the status of professor automatically stops you from being a moron. I’ve had plenty of professors that were morons and plenty that were brilliant. What that professor said was moronic. Sorry bud

The real big ones do not advertise it because of the amount of money they generate.

They can put it on their flag. Something they can finally be proud of after all of the trash the kharadsians brought to their countries name.

There was one in Iceland or something that was in a documentary. They spent like 1.5 mil on electricity per month alone. They just didn’t want to show how many gpus they had.

Are you dumb? I personally don’t carry any cash on me 99% of the time. I carry a debit card with no money on it and transfer from my main account when I buy shit. Sounds silly but makes it nice if my card is lost. 
No cash means I have to transfer to my friends as well or go to an ATM. Go to an atm over a sandwich would be silly. I’d rather get them next time.

It can be legal but this is a federal case. Nebraska, for example, sees anything under an oz of grass as the same as a speeding ticket. While has oil, even .1mg as a felony. Or even edibles. I got caught driving from Colorado to Wisconsin and they weighed the full container at nearly 2 lbs of edibles. While it was only 1000mg of thc and tried to say I was selling 2 lbs of edibles lol. I got off on no jail time and a misdemeanor but they’re fucking vultures.

Not sure :/ unfortunately the feds and the dea are pieces of shit.

Got off for gas and the gas station was 2 miles off of the high way. Should have just waited. But ducking cops were waiting at a speed trap. Second they saw my CO license they go, “I smell something”. Searched my car without my consent because apparently they don’t need it if they “smell” something. It was some bullshit. Ruined a perfectly good bachelor party.
