I stopped reading after you listed Coinbase as an exchange.

do you check your mail? i typically throw out a LOT of bank mail.

what about cold storage on a Windows PC that hasn't touched the net?  for example, installing Win XP on an old netbook with a new HDD, or newly-built computer.

and yes, there are returns that are greater than 0.  if you want 1 BTC in 5 years, good luck with that.  take that mining money, buy BTC now, sit on it for years, and you'll get returns on it as it grows in price.  lower risk, higher reward.

forgive my ignorance, as i've never traded before, but is there a time limit you can set on your orders?  not sure if it's more complex than that.

And if it drops under $1k/BTC, people will be back to buying stuff in decimals...just to challenge that argument.

Coinbase's Authy will utilize your phone number and email to verify.  For Gmail, make sure you've linked your phone number and a secondary email address.  I know you can create a backup of these, but I am not an expert on it.

i take the stance that doing the cold storage on a Windows product as i mentioned may be a safer option than someone, who is unfamiliar with Linux/LiveDVD, creating a wallet on an unfamiliar OS and somehow fucking it up.  Linux and everything is the smarter move, but it's not necessarily safe if you do not know what you're doing.
i guess i'm looking at safety not just from the theft side but also from the user's own technological skill and aptitude side.  either way, just figured it'd be food for thought if some tech illiterate folks read down this far.

seriously... please let these people continue to sell.  i almost feel like those that are nervous for the drops post these notices as if it will not jump back up within a day's time.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:10:06
given your absolute stance, i sincerely hope you have several tens or hundreds of thousands at your disposal.
searching the internet is pretty easy.  if you're relying on this thread and for mining information, you are mistaken.  do some of the leg work yourself.

Is this about Casascius or did I miss something else in particular? Or just general frustration? Thx in advance

that's why everyone post is pretty much "why would you do that?"  returns are diminishing, and most people see more potential value in mining altcoins that can be traded for Bitcoins.
 &lt; scroll down to the bottom and have a look.  see how far Bitcoin is down on that list?  by the time you receive your miner, BTC mining difficulty will only have increased (aka even few rewards for miners).
i think you have some more research to do.

Why do you need a webcam? So it can scan a QR after printing to begin the transfer?
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:09:25
$0.975 per mBTC!  Decimals.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:26:19
this is an interesting idea.  i'm on mobile and can't view, but how much do you think would be a realisitic ROI?  i have no clue about altcoin values.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:01:27
even though that may resolve the issue, i really do not think most users would feel safe reusing the accessed account.  you may, but i do not think most would when money is on the line.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:28:48
hope so... trying to buy-in for 3 days, and it's escalating like a motherfucker.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:50:56
noob here.  so, is Coinbase essentially an online wallet?  can you get your priv keys from them?
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:26:15
oh i know.  i'm just celebrating the fact that all those who wanted to switch to mBTC so people didn't have to deal in "fractions" of a Bitcoin now get to deal in fractions of a dollar.

He could tattoo a copy of his private key to his asshole.  100% unless someone blasts him in the ass.

i figured it was obvious, and i can't edit from the iReddit app. sorry, guy.
