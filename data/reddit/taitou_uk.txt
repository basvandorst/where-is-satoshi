Noob question - When you say an equal amount, does that mean if I had half a bitcoin, I also have half a bitcoin cash? Or if I have $1,000 worth of bitcoin, I also have $1,000 worth of Bitcoin cash? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:25:57
Thank you!  That's very useful and reassuring.

You'll be kicking yourself this time next year if you don't. I was going to invest last October, but waited, then February, but waited, finally invested around May. Could had at least doubled my money if I trusted my instincts early on. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:38:15
Thank you. So I shouldn't worry about a potential flipping? If BCH becomes double the value of BTC, I could swap my hyperthectical half a BTC for half a BCH?  Do you know the process for that on blockchain.info?

Could be the beginning of the end for America. It's time for China and Asia in general to become the world leaders. America will go out like a toddler tantrum. "It's not fair, US Dollar is king currency of the world, wahhhh" Missiles, bombs, fake news to try and destroy Crypto by linking it to terrorism.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:22:03
Ok thank you.  Am I right in thinking that if I have half a bitcoin, the total $ Blockchain.info tells me I have is based purely on that (~$2400) and doesn't add on the extra BCH I actually have?
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:52:08
1)  The banking industry trying to destroy it by joining up with Governments to claim it's linked to terrorism.
2) Scaling - widespread adoption would mean the number of transactions per second would have to be many, many more than it can currently handle.

Arguably Satoshi himself..? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:28:02
Now there's the slight smile of a man who knows he's sitting on a secret - he is Satoshi! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:25:09
Great post from them, they've done it for the community and Bitcoin as a whole, respect. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:30:28
This. 
Can you imagine this sub if S2X actually 'wins'? It dangerous out there, be patient and hodl both chains.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:02:05
"and all alt coins"?? No need for that. Come on. Not all altcoins are Bitcoin competitors. What a dick.
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:26:38
*cough* UK here... 
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:34:58
Plot twist - US Government have done this to taint Bitcoin so they can try and ban it.
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:48:20
It clearly mentions Bitcoin in the coindesk article. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:30:48
Ok thanks.  I did the same with BCH - used the keys to get the BCH from a BCH wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:35:48
Thanks, I imagine this process will need simplifying somehow for the masses to use though.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:44:14
Low fees helps with adoption though.  If you get a friend into Crypto, then they find out it costs them a large % to send their Bitcoin to an exchange, they're generally not impressed.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:19:47
Yeah, it's odd.  This article seems to take a positive outlook on it, but surely this means less privacy and more chance of someone getting hold of your personal information?
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:36:37
Yes I agree.  Whoever it was, or is, decided to be anonymous on purpose.  It's perfectly democratic that Bitcoin doesn't have a known leader, there's almost a poetic beauty to it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:32:52
Yes I read that too... although it also fits nicely with 'Sergey Nazarov'.  I like to think there's an alternative explanation, that it really is a guy in Japan called Satoshi, and they just haven't found him yet...
Personally, I've got an inkling that the guy really was English though, judging by how good his English seemed to be, and the times he was active on the forum.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:36:45
I haven't downvoted it.  Surely if Blockchain.info and Coinbase are both accepting the hardfork, then it will be the main Bitcoin?  They have millions of users don't they?
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:40:03
FUN FACT - Bowie has adorned an alternative currency already - Brixton Pound, a 'local currency for local people' in London:
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:06:27
How does this compare to the TenX card? I'm waiting for them to release NFC on their app! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:46:38
Blockchain.info provides you with your private key which you can use in any Bitcoin wallet to recover your funds. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:57:00
We are until at least 2022 now...  But yeah, I doubt we get many Italians on here.
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:59:31
I accept it's an alt coin, but considering most people on this sub will be automatically receiving it, i'm sure it'd be useful to many to know how to exchange it for BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:49:02
This seems like a massive, exciting step forward, can't believe it doesn't have more upvotes. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:45:51
I think another question is how quickly they'll allow access to both. I like blockchain.info but it took them a long time to support Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:29:36
Hmm, yeah, but it would handily explain how he's never come out as Satoshi, or moved his coins... because he can't unfortunately.  What about Nick Szabo?
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:44:41
Where are these stories? I've had no problem with Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:38:36
Coinbase now offer instant buying...
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:36:52
Well this is certainly very confusing. Thing is, if 95% of miners are signalling for S2X, won't BTC just become that chain effectively?
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:20:12
Ok thanks, but will they support both chains like Coinbase has come out and said they will?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:09:07
Are you saying Putin is unofficially the richest person in the world?  The official is Bill Gates at $86bn, which means the price would only need to reach 87k per BTC for Satoshi to be the richest?
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:54:15
Ok, maybe politics could learn something from Bitcoin? ;)
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:40:40
Same, in perfect equilibrium.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:41:38
Why does no one ever mention Adam Back? He was one of the first contacted by Satoshi, and he's English. I thought the time stamps for Satoshi's forum posts linked up nicely with GMT standard waking times...? 
I mean the guy invented hashcash proof of work, he's the CEO of Blockstream and I never seen his name mentioned!
And look at his face... If that's not the face of an English man who secretly knows he created a worldwide phenomenon, I don't know what is.  He's got the look of an unassuming genius.
Britain invented, or were heavily involved with inventing...  the Internet, Steam Trains, Submarines, Computers, TV, Telephones, Lightbulbs, Lawnmowers, Thermos Flasks, Chocolate bars, Carbon Fibre, Tanks, Jet Engines, Cement, Hovercrafts, and they're currently the leaders in Graphite research.
You can add Bitcoin to that list.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:59:29
I'm all for the original utopian vision of Bitcoin, but a lot of people are going to follow the money and the rising value of whichever Bitcoin the mainstream adopts.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:41:04
Coinbase.com or Blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:53:19
Yes, if he is alive, you can understand why he'd keep his head down...
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:33:41
How can you say they're going against concensus? First of all over 80% are signalling for S2X. Secondly, they're going to offer both chains and bascially call the 'winner' Bitcoin. They can't really do anything fairer than that.
You think I want to confuse newcomers? You think I'm part of some conspiracy or something?
 Absolutely not. The best option is an offline paper wallet, but not everyone wants to do that. Blockchain.info is better than keeping them on an exchange and I'm just sick of the FUD against them because they won't 100% support the Bitcoin you like and instead are going about it in a fair way.
It would be far worse if they only supported one chain, then that went to shit and you ended up with nothing. They're doing the right thing.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:41:49
When looking at mainstream adoption, yes.  The real/successful Bitcoin won't necessarily be the one with the best morals.  The main Bitcoin will be the one that attains mass adoption by the general public.  Where are the general public going to go to buy Bitcoin?  Mostly likely Coinbase and their ilk.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:08:01
So is the top theory that Hal Finney sent the first BTC transaction to himself?
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:42:39
Most sensible, unbiased comment in here, thank you. Everyone is always so quick to bash blockchain.info, but the fact is they give you your private keys. I've used these keys in the past to get access to my Bitcoin Cash on a Cash wallet, so I could sell them. My BTC wasn't affected. I've had no problems with Blockchain.info.
In terms of S2X, it sounds like they're going the same route as Coinbase, which is to support the one with the highest difficulty. I think considering the circumstances and nature of Bitcoin, this is the correct decision as they're following concensus.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:24:14
Yes, but like with BCH, you hold around the time of the hard fork, the snapshot is taken, then you see how it plays out. Don't move your BTC afterwards, and you still have both right? 
Then if S2X starts to dive, you can use your private key on a S2X wallet to get to those funds and move them back to your BTC address, or vice versa. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:37:15
That would make a lot of sense.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:08:08
Are you safe if your email is hacked and you lose your phone?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:10:09
Individuals. I'm just thinking that it's possible with Crypto Currency to make some insanely rich people, when you see gains in the 1,000s of percent. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:20:59
True, but how did he fake it - just easily with two different PCs, or easier than that?
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:34:18
Well they do give you your unique phrase which can use to restore your funds in a wallet.  There seems to be disadvantages to all methods.  If I get a PC/Mobile Wallet what if my PC breaks, or I lose my phone?  Paper wallet - what if my house burns down.  Ledger - costs money, which isn't worth it considering I don't have millions in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:58:04
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:59:31
That's fine, thank you, I'll do some more research. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:42:57
That's what I was thinking, but is there still a chance they could be hacked and my password leaked? Although I have activated the two step security. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:03:05
Great thank you.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:45:29
Thank you. With the phone wallet app, isn't that risky if I lose/break my phone?  Is it easy to switch/move an existing wallet onto an app or hardware? Does the process of doing that remove it from Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:37:56
Oh no, he's ruined! 
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:01:15
Indeed, it's painfully obvious CW is lying in those clips. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:51:49
Could be worth giving hypnosis a go... The answer may be in your brain somewhere!
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:24:50
I guess what I'm saying is are they wrong to try and fight it and they're definitely going to lose, or do you think they could bring it down?
