Does everyone who uses Bitfinex automatically get a Bitgo wallet address?  I don't recall ever setting one up.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:47:00
I used Bitfinex to margin trade, however I never did any verifications for my account, nor followed steps to set up a BitGo wallet... I wonder if that means my funds are likely safe?

My account says it is on withdrawal hold when i try to withdrawal. Anyone else having similar issues?  I didn't change anything in my account except for the forced password and 2fa change.

As someone who had over 700 BTC stolen in the hack, I personally am shocked and outraged that we haven't heard any formal statement from the CEO himself.

withdrawal page currently says, "Your account is currently on withdrawal hold. All withdrawals will be held in a Pending Approval state until the hold is lifted. The most common triggers of a withdrawal hold are account password changes and the changing of certain security settings. Please contact support with questions or concerns. This hold will be lifted at August 12, 2016 18:11."

This morning at 2016-08-02, 08:52:03am, my account balance was moved to a wallet address that began with a 1 (normal wallet).  I did not initiate this transaction.  Does this mean my funds got stolen?  Or is it possible that Bitfinex moved user funds for security purposes?

What's the difference between wallets and accounts on Bitfinex?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:19:53
Hypothetically, if a user's account lost all 100 BTC in the hack... when bitfinex goes back online will that user be able to log in to see roughly 64 BTC in his account?

There is one alt coin that is already a first mover taking advantage of mesh networks... XCurrency ( has already implemented them to provide distributed content via Web 3.0 services. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:54:31
Go read xcs threads... Web 3.0 was planned and discussed well before projects like eth...
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:16:18
The code is open sourced on a delayed timeline with the intention of going fully open source by REV3 to coincide with xcurrencys official public launch. Currently, REV1 code has been open source for almost two months now, and XC just finalized and released REV2 which contains trustless ad hoc mesh networks (among other tech) that we are reading about in this subreddit. 
Please get your facts straight before vehemently attacking XCurrency and its development team.
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:30:37
REV1 code is open source and can be found on their website.

Good thing projects like XCurrency ( are building a decentralized Web 3.0 distribution platform as well as decentralized encrypted communications platform. Fuck the NSA.

XCurrency ( already uses an improved variant of coin shuffle. And they just implemented ad hoc mesh networks to deliver distributed content through Web 3.0 services.

Blocknet has no competitor.  The claim is that xbridge benefits the BTC community in a disruptively superior way than sidechains (i.e. xbridge obsoletes sidechains).

Check out Blocknet (  The lead developer is Dan Metcalf ( and he is also the current head of Ethereum meetups in Boston.
They have developed "xbridge," which they also deem as a "sidechain killer."  Rather than pegging everything to BTC's blockchain (i.e. sidechains), xbridge is an open-source decentralized p2p cross-chain communication network.  Essentially, xbridge creates interoperability between blockchains, allowing nodes on any blockchain to deliver services - for a microfee - to nodes on any other blockchain.  
They are also currently working on a true decentralized exchange, something much needed today.

I'd offer a $20,000 reward if I knew Roger Ver's forgery claim couldn't be disproved also.  Heck, make it $1,000,000.

Roger Ver is clearly a bad actor and BU is an attempt at a hostile takeover.  
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:05:16
Why did it take the SEC and W. twins 3+ years to reach this conclusion? 
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:09:38
This is correct. Historically, withdrawals are usually made 1-2 weeks prior to deadline rather than receiving rejection from SEC.  The fact that they are still making minor adjustments to proposal details 10 days prior to deadline (i.e. Increasing number of shares from 100,000 to 500,000) is incredibly bullish.

This is his true motive.  Of course he doesn't really want BU... but he would take that over 2nd layer protocols like the LN that segwit allows.  However, LN is currently being developed to work apart from segwit, last I heard... so, either way Jihan is going to lose this battle.  It's a shame he doesn't understand that miners' fees will increase anyways as the value of the network increases exponentially with 2nd layer protocols like LN.  Segwit + LN is a win for everyone.

By the time any of these are enforced, there will be mainstream, user-friendly, true decentralized exchanges (sad that I have to say 'true,' but many flippantly use the word 'decentralized'). i.e. - Blocknet's DX, currently alpha testing.

The Blocknet is the worlds first fog computing service bus for value transfer protocols. Recognizing that there will never only be "one blockchain to rule them all" (as humanities data needs are too great), the Blocknet serves as an opensource, decentralized, inter-operable framework for all blockchains.  This will allow communication between blockchains (including bitcoins) and their services (ie - encrypted messaging, anon, instant transfers, etc.) through a chain-agnostic p2p network.
