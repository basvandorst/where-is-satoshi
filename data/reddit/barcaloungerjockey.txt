Ahaha, good one! Which language?

Wait, are you saying I can't store an infinite string using a string that I would have to generate infinitely? ;)
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:36:41
That's my point. There's also the claim by the OP that one could find a full-length HD move in pi.
Movies follow a format and are far from truly random. Pi being an irrational number is. Searching through a string representation of pi to find a string representation of a movie is not computational plausible. The example he looked up is small. Imagine doing it for a 40k JPG or a 1GB MP4 to get an exact match. And those are lossy compressed and not exact.
Ultimately the issue is that someone did (although I have yet to see solid evidence that it's true) or can (certainly possible) burn copyrighted or illegal info or images into the blockchain is true, and it's a problem, because immutable data is rarely a good thing.

You keep stating money laundering laws hurt more innocent people (assumably without correction or recourse.) Not counting seizure and RICO laws, can you provide solid examples of "way more" innocents being harmed?

Say I want to store pi with a zero prepended to it. What's the index?
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:46:50
I read that SE post, and most of the replies didn't seem to be from serious mathematicians, just some folks talking about what pi is known to be.
I've looked into this debate periodically for over a couple of decades and it's always in contention. Strongly suspected but not provable, and I know a few in the "disagree" camp. From a purely mathematical take, finding pi + 1 in pi can't be done. From a "we're dealing with infinite numbers" take, it's probable but not realistic.
Given the computation needed, it's probably a safe $100 bet that nobody can find the index of the DVD encoding of Terry Gilliam's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" in my lifetime.
Fun to discuss, though.

Yup, I'm a nerd, I know my P and NP, and the mainstream pi algos. The BBP algo allows computation starting at any point, but as you say, the question is knowing where to start, and BBP doesn't give a leg up on that, much less then matching large numbers against what was computed.
While I'm hopeful that you're right about a quick search, I'm doubtful. Search and pattern matching is not a mathematical problem per se, so while that's also advancing I don't foresee any big breakthroughs, outside of quantum computing. That might yield some results in the way Shor's algo did with primes (also a maths problem.)
Interesting paper on using BBP:

But you do trust exchanges and the likes of Bitpay? Or do you believe everyone will be swapping BTC in person without intermediaries? And that people will save up enough to buy cars and homes without loans?
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:51:25
LOL! Interesting thought:
mypi = str(pi) + '1'
I guess the str() call never returns since pi is infinite.

Great post, thanks. You've blown past what my currently addled mind can handle. I'll have to do a little research to catch up on the world of pi.
Has there been any recent insights on dealing with finding repeated numbers in pi? If I make a movie that encodes into 1GB worth of zeros, while I'm down with infinite time and ability to compute pi infinitely as non-constraints, last time I checked it's far from computationally possible to find that in pi, and as the size of the all-zeros file increases, finding it increases in such a way that it can be proven impossible. Last time I took a glance, there was contention that there exists an answer for that one.

The data for routes is stored in smaller subsets. Say you have to go through a couple road from point A, across town and then a couple roads to point B. That route isn't calculated as a whole.
The route is calculated from A to the main route (say a highway) then from that exit to point B. It's done in three parts, each weighted dynamically by traffic. There's no reason to store a route from A to B - you chain together segments to complete the route. You can do "good enough" pruning on the smaller, localized segments ala Garmin.
It's a large map but broken down like that is certainly storable, because the data is rarely updated (new roads, etc.) Common routes can be calculated and stored, esp. for the smaller segments.
That's not the case with LN, which is changing constantly. That's the real key here. We're talking static vs. dynamic maps. You're looking at how GPS works but that's a different problem than LN has. Does that make sense? We're saying that the P2P and GPS models, while at first glance might look like the same problem, don't apply. Cheers!

Perhaps I misunderstood your statement, even in the context of what you were responding to.
What outside information does that site use? Do you count "known data formats" as such? Because that's all it's using. I don't consider being able to find something in JPEG format "outside info."
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:51:35
Does pi contain all number combos? For an given example of pi, look up pi + 1 or pi with any digit appended or prepended to it. Not found. Pi is merely transcendental.

Good question. So far search engines have avoided getting into most legal troubles for linking to copyrighted and illegal material by trying to filter/avoid it, processing ECD/DMCA requests and cooperating with authorities. Torrent sites, on the other hand, have been eliminated repeatedly although they too are just just hosting links. In a sick sense, it's riskier to link to copyrighted material because you end up angering Disney.
The problem I see here is that the blockchain has no way to filter what's put in it, and being immutable cannot respond to ECD/DMCA requests or lawsuits.
Ultimately, if someone sticks something copyrighted, illegal, etc. into the blockchain and it's found and decoded, then each node with a copy of that can be accused of having, hosting and distributing it. That's a key thing: nodes don't just copy the blockchain, they also upload parts of it to new nodes. As such, that's distribution of said material, which is legally far, far worse.
Disclaimers: not a lawyer, etc. just have worked with DMCA reqs and lawsuits, web hosting, etc. The above are guesses, not answers.
Edit: I think I'll see if I can get a solid answer from or such.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:44:50


That's not true. People have put encoded messages in the blockchain since the early days and people have been finding and decoding them since.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:21:45
Assuming you're serious, nope. Combining it with any rational number (such as 1, or adding a digit or character) still gives you an irrational number, but not pi. Pi +1 != pi.
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:13:07
Gut feelings are fine with me. I have enough sense of it as well, and my gut says this one might be intractable. There's just too much in a large, dynamic network like this, with nodes going up/down, new routes being (re)mapped, and then having to weigh them based on congestion, where the funds "are" to be able to process transactions efficiently, and other factors.
If this does get solved, even somewhat, on a large scale, I'll be the first to say neato! Fun discussion, cheers!

Heh, I used to have ASCII memorized in hex decades ago, but it's been at least two since I've touched assembly.
I don't understand how some (many? most?) BTC fans aren't concerned about this?

Can you provide examples of increasing use as a currency? All I've been seeing is more and more people who were accepting it as such abandoning it, due to the volatility and difficulty in use and liquidity.

That's an excellent point.
I've posted a question over on for now, asking if it'd be appropriate for the main sub. I'm not a regular reader there so I didn't want to just wade in.
I'm fairly certain that bad data in the blockchain can and will lead it to being declared illegal and that people might end up getting prosecuted for hosting and distributing it.
I'm not sure what the solution would be, other than a complete rewrite of the blockchain format so that it cannot hold anything other than transaction data in such a way that bad stuff is almost impossible to store on it. A hard fork or prune of the existing chain doesn't stop it from immediately getting "corrupted" again.
This problem is inherent to any publicly distributed immutable datastore. There's many reasons immutability is not a desirable nor useful property in the real world.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:30:11
LOL, I should have been more clear in why I brought this up as a thought puzzle. I was trying to illustrate that the author's example of finding movies in pi was a red herring. It's a really fun discussion, but it is in no way related to being able to store copyrighted or illegal information in the blockchain, which has already been done.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:55:41
That's what makes 'pifs' so funny. Storing a file of all "0" chars by index becomes computational intensive as the file size grows because pi does not repeat, and at some point the index itself becomes bigger than the file itself.
I adore silly projects like 'pifs'.
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:24:02
Roads aren't being build/removed and routes don't change often, so they are calculated and stored. GPS uses that data to make a "best guess" estimate, because with GPS it's "good enough." LN would have nodes being constantly added and removed. Generating all routes dynamically is computational intensive and is a big issue.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:10:05
That's absolutely right. Now trying looking that up in pi.
My point is that working with irrational numbers has zilch to do with blockchain, so it's a red herring. Blockchain is a known format that people have been storing messages, images, etc. in since day one, and can be used to store copyrighted or illegal data, which is a big problem no matter how much hand-waving justification is presented.
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:05:38
Absolutely. Just wanted to clarify for others, and hopefully you won't owe anything more. Fortunately the IRS seems to understand that mistakes are common (esp. given the complexity of tax code) and are reasonable when working through them.
I went through an audit and, in itself, it was fairly painless, just an enormous unpaid and joyless time-suck.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:46:14
Just FYI "audit protection" doesn't really do anything. It and good faith answers will not prevent penalties from being assessed on top of what you owe plus interest accrued. Inability to settle that debt will then move to a payment plan with interest, if necessary.

As soon as you sell, trade or convert you have a taxable event that must be reported to the IRS, regardless of gains or losses. In the latter case, it's worth reporting for the loss offsets or amortized write-offs.
