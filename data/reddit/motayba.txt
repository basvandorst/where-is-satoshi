Derp. What's worse is I had switched to ETH/USD and didn't think to try those buttons then. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-12-21 19:37:10
Thanks for drawing that distinction. Makes sense. I can probably handle the small risk of losing $100!
@_date: 2016-12-19 13:25:36
Because it's not actually expensive...yet.

I had to upload a photo of the front and back of my DL for Coinbase, but I didn't have to take a photo of myself. But the worst are the limits. 8 weeks of $250 deposits to get your weekly limit raised...?
You should just call your CC company. They probably blocked it and can let it go through next time you try.

How do I get my ethereum address for GDAX? I see the bitcoin address after clicking Withdraw/Deposit, but not ethereum.

Roger. Agreed on the last point. And I think attempts to create state-sanctioned cryptocurrency will just legitimize bitcoin further—at least in the short term.
Thanks for being brave enough to say something. Lol.

What is regarded as the benchmark price? I've seen different depending on the exchange.
And what's your usual place to look at charts?
Edit: Answered! Thanks, y'all. Those sites look good.
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:54:45
Thanks, yo.
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:30:33
Great. Thanks again—and I like your site so far. Yeah, trailing stops would be my number-one feature request. Good luck to y'all.
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:57:12
Too funny.
So there isn't a consensus benchmark? People just quote...whatever?
@_date: 2016-12-23 13:38:18


No hyperbole here. Lol.
@_date: 2016-12-20 14:18:22
Yeah. It's all the GS guys that scare me.
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:21:49
Lol. Sorry, I was asking for a URL. A good website for charting BTC and ETH for starters?
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:52:41
Can't you tell?
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:14:36
At least in the US, you may be wrong about millennials losing interest in gold (but not about their awareness of bitcoin). Apparently, they were the biggest buyers of gold (and therefore the biggest losers) when Trump won:

Oh, wow. That's helpful—and that's the UI I saw in the screenshot I mentioned. Now it all makes sense. Thanks!
Any plan for trailing stop/limit orders?
Do my linked accounts and limits carry over? I can't seem to tell after digging around for a couple minutes.

Thanks. As a bitcoin newb, I appreciate this.
So what's the safest and most reliable way to buy BTC and put it on a hard wallet for cold storage? Or straight onto a hard wallet for (probably infrequent) use?
Unless there's a safer and/or more discreet way, I was thinking of Coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:24:10
Haha. Is their app considered insecure? Yeah, I don't wanna use a hot wallet of any kind more than I have to. I'm not ready to have it on my phone, at least.
@_date: 2016-12-20 14:19:58
Lol. Yeah, Trump prefers to pick fights with *actual* superpowers like China.
