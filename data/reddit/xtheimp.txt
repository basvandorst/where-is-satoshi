Why not? The fee is kinda high, but I've done this to buy coins instantly. Then I transfer money from my normal account to my credit card account. As far as one had the money to use I don't see the problem.

A month? I got mine verified last Saturday after a couple of days. Probably resent my documentation 7 times. The last time it only took like 30 min before I finally got verified.

I experienced this this weekend, bought 10 euro worth of btc to test Coinbase. Was more expensive to move the btc to my wallet than what it was worth.

How come when one buy coins from Coinbase the buying rate is higher than the price on their dashboard? For example its been under 15 000 euros the last hour, but when buying it says over 15 000?

If u new my luck and I sold, it would never dip again :/ lol but, yeah. I would rather just play it safe and hodl for some months. See where it goes. I know there is a chance it will won't grow anymore, but I personally believe it will.

Yes, I kinda figure that's the reason, and I won't blame them for it. I got an account at Coinbase, but want to buy some other things like ripple. And I've heard bitstamp is one of the best in Europe. Not sure if this is true since I'm an infant at this. Still learning.

Ok, but a marshmallow or two is definitely not bad for your health. Sugar is inherently not bad for you. Its just simpler carbohydrates than for example sweet potato, which has more micronutritions. The body breaks both into glucose, release the same amount of insulin, but faster for sugar than sweet potato.

Bought in at 17300 and 18000. I'd rather it went to zero and I lose all than selling now at a loss and feel like a failure. Because it will go back up again.

Yeah, would like to know this also. Their fees are pretty high I think.

Can litecoin please increase and btc dip so I can turn all my current ltc into btc? Typical of me to buy high lol

Haha I recognize myself there, just that I thought about it in 2015. But that doesn't matter, I never bought anything.
Will do now though, as soon as Coinbase will verify my identity. Takes forever...
