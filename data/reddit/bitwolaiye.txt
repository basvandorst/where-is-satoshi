I am a developer of Bither.
Here is a video of how to use HDM.
You ask why so few downloads. I think there are two reason.
1. There are a lot of Chinese users which can not download direct from Google Play.
2. We are a small team which is focus on developing our app, so we have no time to introduce ourself.
You can download Bither and try to use it, I think you will like it.
