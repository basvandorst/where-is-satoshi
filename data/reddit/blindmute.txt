The only reason it's having trouble being used as a currency is because too many people are using it... It hasn't just stopped being a currency; as usage declines its value will increase again. There is market equilibrium.

There are hundreds to thousands, because literally anyone can just make one whenever they feel like it. They are only given legitimacy by their followings; maybe 5 or 6 have a fair bit of users.

It's gotta just be a formatting error, it should basically look like a block of random text. No headers, no commas, no empty lines, just 32 lines of private keys. If it still doesn't work then idk what's wrong with it.

Download 'Electron Cash'. Move all your BTC out of Electrum wallet to a new wallet address, if any is in there. Then export your private keys of the old now-empty wallet from Electrum and import them into EC and the rest works as normal
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:09:33
When you export the private keys from Electrum, you choose CSV. This gives you the public,private keys. EC wants the import to be just the private keys seperated by new lines, so open it in excel or do whatever you gotta do to format it that way

It hit a ceiling and has low growth? It was at an ATH literally 3 days ago. It has steady growth and has tripled in the past month. ETH and LTC flatlining for the past year and having a spike this month don't make them suddenly superior, healthy coins.

FDIC does not introduce new currency into the market to when it replaces someone's money. There is a federal budget and a coffer where this replacement money comes from.

Agreed. As someone from r/financialindependence with a buy and hold mindset, this sub is ridiculous. I bought a coin at $2300, I'll buy more throughout this fall, and I feel more than fine with holding onto them for 10 years if necessary. Anyone panicking right now is simply a gambler who never thought a bear market could happen to them.

If some kid holding a sign up is affecting your investment proceedings, you may be a bit too conservative to want to invest in btc
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:03:27
It requires the future to imitate the past, which there is absolutely no guarantee of. It requires believing that BTC is always going to rise in the long run.

$330k can in the long run turn into over $10k per year for nothing. You invest that all right now along with your job earnings and you could retire at 40.

When you send bitcoin, you send it to an address that looks like a long bunch of random letters. This is a public key, and it's fine for everyone to know what it is. But once you send that coin, only the person with the associated private key to that address will be able to access and spend the coin. The private key is a secret and is generated when you make a wallet, along with the corresponding public key.  
You could send bitcoin to any random address that may not even exist, if you wanted to, but then nobody would ever see it again unless someone got extremely lucky when they made a wallet. So therefore if you generate a wallet offline and then send coins to your public address, you still get the coins. There is no network of wallets like you're thinking.  
To actually spend the coins from an offline wallet, you have to generate the transaction on an online computer kind of like a blank check, then you transfer the transaction file to the offline computer and sign it with your private key, then transfer it back and send the transaction. This is obviously tedious which is why people with large amounts of bitcoin will have an offline 'savings' wallet and a less secure online spending wallet.

I disagree with that excerpt. "Bitcoin is very useful, that’s why people are willing to pay an average of $0.94/tx at the time of this writing to use it."
No, they are willing to pay that much to buy and sell it as an investment. The vast majority of people are not 'using' Bitcoin, they are just trading it for profit. A lot of people buying and selling Bitcoin as traders is not actually indicative of a healthy currency, because the threshold for "fee too high to buy things with" is different from "fee too high to buy and sell coins for profit".
Bitcoin is a currency, not a stock. It has literally no utility value outside of buying and selling things. If people are unwilling to do that because it's being misappropriated as a stock, it's not good for the currency in the long run and is bound to crash.

But when USD deflates, you don't pay tax on that.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:20:48
There's no reason for this to keep rising at the moment. Until Aug 1 happens and/or a solution to high fees is settled upon, the rising price is illogical. There's nothing driving this growth at the moment, and for that reason, I'm not buying any more until the crash

An ATH can by definition never be a dip.

Have your money in a 'bank' (a corporation) or be your own bank.

Yes, basically as long as the private keys and the seed never touch anything connected to the internet, you should be completely safe.

There will likely be a crash July 31 and a resurgence after regardless

The only negative is that whoever holds the money could just decide to scam everyone and steal all their money. This has happened with one of the exchanges in the past. While it is illegal for them to do, your money isn't insured or anything so even if they got caught you probably are still fucked.
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:08:37
Yes, it is. You are taxed when you earn the money, and you are taxed again on its gains when you sell the coins as capital gains. In Japan, it is recognized as currency, so when the value of the currency goes up it just goes up, there is no taxable event.

Okay, this is r/personalfinance talking. You have about $300k USD at 22. This is life changing stuff.  
I would strongly recommend selling some of this off. Like maybe half. $150k can grow safely in index funds and become a huge house payment. Yes, BTC may get even higher and you could become a millionaire, but in my opinion getting $100k at your age is life changing to the point that I wouldn't risk holding it all.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:37:01
The only problem is that with the fees, each time you do this you lose a certain amount. So if the price went up like $5 you could not actually profit from this, because the fees to sell would be more than $5. You also need a fair amount of liquid capital to do this frequently, as it can take time for your transaction to go through. Before you receive your funds, you would not be able to buy more unless you had enough cash already.
