I don't understand how you can live longer if you don't eat.

BCH is not doing very well in being cheap and fast either.
There are altcoins in the $500 million and above market cap that have below a cent transaction fees, a few seconds confirmation time, and are arguably more decentralized than BCH.

Me 4 years ago (but learning otherwise didn't get me to buy because of other misconceptions I had).

try Purse.io
other nonkyc escrow sites like paxful are generally too expensive to use gift cards on

Like-kind exchanges do not get taxed, and crypto used to fall under that but then they decided it only counts for real estate. This means the tax applies for trading game items.
Though sometimes items aren't compared with dollars so not sure how it works. What happens if you otc trade an altcoin that isn't on an exchange?

 seems like a more exciting experience. Especially seeing your Bitcoin amount go up when your fiat is priced in Bitcoin.

Demand is limited to the world's population. I don't understand people who think its value will keep going up forever, since the world population will reach a cap (there can only be so many humans/robots on Earth).

If you're near a store such as Walmart you can buy giftcards to buy bitcoin with paxful or localbitcoins instead of waiting.

No you need to buy a whole bitcoin, just like how dollars have no decimals.

Will cost a bit more than $50 though.
