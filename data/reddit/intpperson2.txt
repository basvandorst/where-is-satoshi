Gold is a pain to buy, sell and store. You need to be in the same physical place at the same time to buy or sell it. It can be fake, and there's always a large % difference between buy and sell price. 
Gold prices are subject to manipulation by governments and large financial institutions. 
Bitcoin solves all these problems.

Don't be surprised if it doesn't do that because you're expecting it. Markets always have a way of doing what you least expect.

So with this model, I would just borrow as many bitcoins as possible, then wait for them to appreciate in value. 
Because you can't charge interest on BTC loans, how would that work? I mean you could charge interest, but it would lead to higher and higher bitcoin price, the price would always rise at a faster rate than interest. If BTC price didn't rise faster than interest, there would never be enough bitcoins to pay the loan and the interest.

Exactly. I forgot to mention that one.

Given the lack of enthusiasm for 2x and its inherent problems, I don't think the price run-up resulted from demand for 2x coins.
Every market seems to have a way of surprising people when they least expect it. If "everyone" is expecting a drop, then it possibly won't happen. 
I think when it's over, and if Bitcoin remains the dominant chain, it will give the market more confidence that Bitcoin is resistant to these attacks. That may be enough to spark the next wave up.

These are the last people I want to see promoting Bitcoin.

Oh, OK. 
Personally, I wouldn't stand within 100 feet of them. People might associate you with them.
