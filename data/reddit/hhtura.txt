Where is this ledger entry stored?

I get that the chances of finding your particular drawer are very low, but wouldn't literally every drawer have something in it?
Or, from another angle: he shows a 160 digit binary number near the beginning. I understand that my chances of guessing a particular combination of ones and zeros is very low, but why would I need to guess one particular combination? Can't I put in any combination I want and have it be accepted provided it's the required length?

Oh. I think the problem I had is when I heard people talk about how mind-bogglingly vast the number boxes is, I thought they were talking about the number of apples, like the only reason my bitcoin is safe is there's lots of other bitcoins to choose from.
If the ratio of actual bitcoins to empty-space-that-potentially-could-hold-bitcoins is also mind-bogglingly vast, things make a lot more sense than what I was imagining earlier today.

But then what, in this analogy, is the actual bitcoin? Is not the bitcoin itself just a string of characters?

I suppose what was important in your post is that bitcoins aren't actually tied to that 160 digit binary number as I thought they were. That number is just a holding cell, and the bitcoin "itself" is just information on a torrent file somewhere. (Or so that's how I'm currently imagining it.)

It says the satoshi unit is only used for convenience and that bitcoin itself is infinitely divisible.

Speaking of completely useless.
"Your questions have answers, but I'm not going to tell you what they are. Hah!"

So it's stored on various servers somewhere, which are then synced together somehow?

Well, is the idea that everything should be fine *until that point*? ~~We're already more than half way there if I'm understanding the FAQ correctly.~~

Okay, so is what you're saying that if I send you a bitcoin, I'm only really sending you the public string, not the private one, and that by doing so my own private string stops working? Does the client create a new private string for you to use, perhaps?

What does the 21 million limit refer to, then? If there's only 21 million potential bitcoins, but 145\*10^39 possible addresses, I'd think that would mean there are 145\*10^(39)–21\*10^6 addresses that can't be used.

But how could they know this if they don't know what my private key is?

Is what you're saying that most 160 digit binary numbers can't contain bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:47:19
That's what I'm doing by asking these questions.
@_date: 2015-07-02 15:43:58
So we could fill every address despite still only have 21 million bitcoins in total?
