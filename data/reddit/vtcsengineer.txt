I expect that [Verifiable Computing]( will play a role.

Yes these same vectors apply not only to all software but hardware as well.
With banking info there's a limit to how much damage can be done.  ACH transactions can easily be reversed.
Not so much with crypto.  Sure the devs could decide to fork to fix a heist.  But what if it was done slowly over time so it isn't obvious?  Or if a coinjoin scheme or similar was used to blend the coins into oblivion? With enough effort it could be next to impossible to reverse.

It's happened frequently before because people are using predictable seeds for their private keys such as the public address of a previous transaction, words from the dictionary, their birthday etc.  A random collision is considerably less likely than two random people picking up the exact same grain of sand.   See the [Birthday Problem]( for an explanation.

It may very well be a fork of a trusted open source project but the application is closed source.  So until you've stepped through every machine code instruction with a debugger you can't say with any confidence that it wasn't nefariously modified.  Even then it's easy to miss.

Blockchain solves many more problems than bitcoin does.

One of the most severe security vulnerabilities in recent memory was a tiny one line bug called [Heartbleed](  While I personally agree with the vast majority of researchers who concluded it was an accident, there still exists a chance, however small, that it wasn't.
My point is, blame may not be so easily attributable.

You know that forked code made it into the production application how exactly?  I haven't seen a bitcoin wallet using [verifiable computing]( yet.  Someone get on that.  You'll be rich.

A malicious application on the phone would have access to all of those same sensors.  The algorithm could be reverse engineered with a debugger.  Pretty good but not perfect.  A blocking [hardware RNG]( based on quantum effects such as nuclear decay would be my  choice.

The private keys could still be generated in such a way that [Bitcoin.com]( could recover them **even without phoning home**.  This is just considerably more sketchy.  The only remotely valid reason for phoning out would be to source truly random entropy say from [random.org](  Without the source code or until someone performs network analysis there's no way to know.

Guessing it was a vulnerability in TeamViewer such as [this one from December, 2017]( or similar.  Wouldn't trust anything but a multi-factor SSH session for remote access.  You could tunnel VNC through SSH for the best of both worlds.
