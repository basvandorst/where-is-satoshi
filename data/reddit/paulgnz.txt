Square and Metal Pay are the two top dogs in this area, Metal Pay are integrating crypto in to merchant facilities which is super exciting.

The deep state.

In fact why is this not some sort of Web app. Meteor or something. So much potential.

This is such a waste. Considering it's a for profit website that is ranking incredibly well, it's simply not polished enough.

Technically this is a tender is it not?
