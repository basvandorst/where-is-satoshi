I would use a shoebox or plain paper bag, rather than a jar.

Interesting. Did not know this was possible.

Sending to the wrong address? That means you don't know how to copy/paste.
Lost your keys? Should have made a backup.
Customer support? Who do you call when you accidentally lose a $100 bill?
Some people would call those features. It's just like cash, but digital and inherently deflationary.

1. Coinbase to Coinbase transfers incur no transaction fee because they are not written directly to the blockchain. Coinbase runs on a sidechain.
2. The Shift card with Coinbase allows you to spend your Coinbase balance from a Visa card and not incur a blockchain network fee.
3. Outside of Coinbase, I use BCH because the fees are less than $0.01 and it works just like BTC back in the day.

Something tells me coinbase doesn't have much paper money laying around that they need to count.

Since when can you just write whatever data you want to the chain?
The only good use case I see for LN is probably recurring subscriptions or as a substitute for third party escrow when delivering a nonreversible service. Besides those situations, I don't see any benefit to scaling off chain. It will only be worth the cost of opening a channel if both parties transact often. I don't see anyone using LN to pay for a meal in a strange city or send money to a friend.

Who said anything about trading? I use coinbase in order to spend crypto as a medium of exchange through their shift card, but I keep most of what I own in my own wallets where I control the keys. I already do more than half of my daily business in crypto and trying to move more in that direction.
And I'm not blaming anyone. I'm blaming the fact that we've become complacent about our money in this culture, to the point where almost no one knows how to truly protect their own assets, and we've become dependent on third parties (banks) to do it for us. Historically, central banks have abused that trust with inflationary monetary policy. Bitcoin is an answer to that problem.
Your concerns are legitimate, but I'm trying to say that there are solutions already being offered for the exact issues you brought up. The difference is that with crypto, the ideal solution will always be one in which YOU are the one controlling the keys to your wallet. Coinbase is not ideal from that perspective, but it offers the features you want from a bank, only with crypto.

I think I'm the one being trolled. My responses have been clear and what you just said doesn't even make sense.

I lost a cat last year to a careless roommate who let her outside while I was out of town. The roommate couldn't understand why I was so upset and told me "it's just a cat."
It took all my strength not to go berserk.

Ok. Now imagine back when the internet was being built if some company came in and refused to implement higher bandwidth on the physical layer even though the technology allowed for it.
I don't hear anyone saying the solution is to keep increasing the block size forever, but 1MB almost certainly isn't ideal. It takes experimentation to find out what block size works best in practice, just like we pretty much settled on 1Gbps as the modern standard for ethernet.
Blockstream has people believing that even increasing blocks to 2MB will be catastrophic to the network, which is asinine. It's almost 2018 and even a $300 laptop on public WiFi could run a full node.

For people like you, there's Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:15:05
What exactly is decentralized about micro transactions being priced out of the market? What is the benefit of keeping the block size small even when current technology easily allows for a small increase for little to no expense?

Read my above comment. The murder for hire allegations were dismissed with prejudice. It was all fabricated to make Ross look like a murderous kingpin.
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:31:12
Sounds to me like you're just being an apologist for the state. Can't even admit that Ross did nothing wrong and should never have been sent to prison, much less for life.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:14:10
You can see his eyes moving to read the teleprompter.
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:44:18
Well I suppose you have a right to that opinion. My opinion is that you are a bootlicker.
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:37:19


Yes they were. Stop spreading lies about something you know nothing about. You are just parroting what you've heard in the media.
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:16:48
Fine, but double life with no parole? We literally have mass murderers being found guilty and receiving less harsh punishments. Is that your definition of justice?
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:06:37


Actually none of that is true. Other sites after Silk Road allowed those things, but SR actively banned anything that could be used to harm others. There certainly were not "murder for hire" services on there. That is just a bunch of lies meant to turn the public against Ross.

"He's a spy - blow him up. I'm gonna go take a shit."
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:33:41


Actually, a lot of people say that.
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:22:03
Yeah and everyone learned their lesson and now there are no more dark web markets.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:36:12
It actually is.
