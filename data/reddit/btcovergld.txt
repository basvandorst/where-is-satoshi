Yeah, it sounds like he's referring to something like the coinbase card though. A custodial solution works as long as you realize the risks involved in keeping your Bitcoin with a third party exchange vulnerable to government confiscation, hacks, and fractional reserve lending.

Again, I don't agree. Bitcoin will continue to be injected into the system via miners regardless of any restrictions any governments put on its use or ownership.
That, combined with even a few people interested in acquiring some will cause the price to increase solely due to scarcity, and miners setting the floor based on the hashpower required to mint a coin.
You're overlooking a very important part of the economic incentive mechanism built directly into the protocol.

I see a lot of people in assuming that their altcoin of choice will only follow Bitcoin after Bitcoins meteoric rise.
I'm going to feel bad for these guys as BTC Dominance climbs to 90% in that period and they still can't figure out that Bitcoin isn't fast or cheap but solves the problem that exists today : an insanely secure monetary good with a set in stone deflationary economic model.
No other coin has the security, track record, or decentralization behind it.

The only way you could stop these coins from being 'dumped' on the open market is to violate the spirit of decentralization.
What happens when the coins are seized by the arresting party?
You think the police can just keep them and not sell them?
No transaction on the blockchain is a 'bad' transaction. Sure they misled people. But the solution is to teach people not to be stupid with their money. Not to try to police the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:52:51
Lol. How misinformed.
The reason capacity is being shown as decreasing is because large node operators are realizing they didn't need as many channels as they once thought. Also, more and more nodes are going private so the count is actually increasing.
Secondly, I can still get an on chain transaction across for 1 sat /byte in under 6 hours.

Holding it is it's real intention. I think you've been caught up in the 'it should be used as a currency for every day purchases!' mumbo jumbo.
Sure if you ignore what Bitcoin is becoming, do that - and promptly miss the train.
If you look deeper you'll see that Bitcoin, which has a worse ability to make these smaller cheaper faster transactions, is doing MUCH better in terms of dollar value and adoption than the coins that have these features.
Most people don't care to try to understand WHY that is the case. Those people go to and  get 5k different answers to which coin does those things the best.
The problem is, they didn't use their critical thinking skills to help them understand that Bitcoin is better because of its massive hashpower being used to secure the code that ensures Bitcoins unchangeable monetary policy. Due to the hashpower ensuring this policy, many more people run nodes than people that do on any other network. This means that Bitcoin is the most decentralized option by a MASSIVE margin.
This is precisely why its value will continue to rise, and other crypto will come and go.

Bitcoin is a long term investment, not a short term one. If you're uncomfortable potentially losing 80% of the value of it in a 3-4 month period, while still understanding the upside potential of 10x + in 4-5 years, then you shouldn't do it.
Edit : also, after reading your post fully it's apparent that you don't fully understand the store of value proposition of Bitcoin.
That should be the first thing for you to look into.

This guy's first post on reddit was directly after the 12/2017 crash. Kinda sad really. What a train wreck.
"First post. I joined Reddit after jumping on the bitcoin craze.
Ah... Wow. Bitcoin turned out to be nothing I thought it was/what (i thought) it claimed to be.
First thing... Easier than banks?? You have to days to convert fiat to bitcoin and endure anal probe level of scrutiny.
Second... Privacy??? Are you all insane?? ID photos. SS number. Facial recognition photo. My bank account log in credentials. ATM have facial and Palm Scanning.
Third...fees. Yah. My 200 turned 150 by the time i.got it to my investment. Lets hope i make 25% to cover my transaction fees.
Bitcoins the future? It's bleak. It's 100% Orwellian and my opinion of it has changed profoundly. I assume my identity has been stolen so i won't even bother investing.
Good luck. I predict massive profits from bitcoin and IT WILL BECOME THE WORLD CURRENCY. Who wouldn't succumb to 100% privacy invasion in order to access there newfound wealth.
I'll have to wait for a real decentralized currency."

Honestly it’s hard to mess it up as long as you’re somewhat careful each time.
You just have to check that the address that you pasted has the same 5 or 6 first or last characters from where you copied it. In the case of very large transactions I check all the characters.
There are clipboard hijackers, but since they have to generate an address for their own wallet that looks like the one you copied, it’s never close to being the same (maybe they’ll get the first or second character right but never past 3 or 4).
@_date: 2019-09-15 20:17:10
Uh, no. Both are equally shit.
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:55:47
Your argument is bad. 
Bitcoin is partly ingenious in its creation because it is a complex system that takes time to understand. Once people finally do understand it, they feel like everyone who dislikes Bitcoin either isn't smart enough to understand it, or hasn't put the time in to understand it.
This is what in part drives adoption.
The fact that you either weren't smart enough to store your dad's Bitcoin, or you didn't put the time in to understand how to secure the Bitcoin, similarly makes the people who do understand that aspect of it more bullish because it means less Bitcoin in the system overall (more deflation).
It sucks about your dad's dementia, but using that as your argument about why Bitcoin won't work in a Bitcoin sub isn't going to end in upvotes.
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:09:34
I disagree with this completely. 
Part of the reason why Bitcoin is gaining traction is because when people finally understand it after a ton of research, they realize how smart other people were to understand it years before themselves.
The Bitcoin protocol is the simplest it can be without giving people a false sense of security. Tell them to remember their 12 seed words and maybe a passphrase. That's the best you're going to get because that's what's defined in the protocol.
'Improving' on that system on the protocol layer would only make Bitcoin less secure, while 'improving'  that system on the application layer would the application controllers a vector to steal users Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-05-15 22:04:45
When a lot of people are queuing up to send BTC, it takes longer to send because only so many transactions per second can happen on the blockchain. 
Although it may seem like a negative, this incentive mechanism will allow miners to continue to make money once the block reward becomes negligible, thus allowing the bitcoin blockchain hashpower to keep rising.
Some blockchains (bitcoin cash) decide to increase the blocksize in a trade off between lower fees, with less security. Bitcoin has decided that its best to not make that trade off at this point, and instead focus on layer two solutions like the lightning network, which allows for instant feeless transactions without compromising the integrity of the underlying blockchain.
You can decide which approach makes more sense to you.
