When you say 'regulated' do you mind elaborating or linking me to who regulates these things?

Maybe not 10x, but something. Why do I need to be in it for the bad? Early adoption doesn't have to be bad, I just dont understand the stage bitcoin is in vs the risks and I suppose this is where I stall.

The difference between me dying and a financial crisis is foresight and warning as far as I can tell. Sounds like every "hack" either comes without warning or its covered up.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:32:32
Thanks for your advice.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:30:57
This makes the most sense to me to shift the paradigm I've been dealing with thus far. Thanks

I mentioned in another reply that I do know enough about bitcoin however I dont understand enough about the risk quotient. I do understand there can be false claims against the system but I'm well aware how to be diligent in the current way the system works. With Bitcoin I simply do not know the course of action if something were to go horribly wrong. I understand the volatility aspect however I can appreciate the value retaining quality a 'future' currency or platform will have. Thanks for the replies, a good discussion.

I'm looking for constructive solutions, not passive aggressive comments. Bonus points for Cyprus, a few people beat you to Greece.

Sounds like exchanges have a TON of risk. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:21:16
Is that a product?
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:17:47
I have a hard time believing that its limited to two uses. I could likely do a better job of understanding if you took the time to explain with perspective.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:53:31
These metaphors make perfect sense to me so thank you for understanding what I'm asking. Why do people use exchanges if this is the case? Why not direct to the next person willing to pay what BTC is worth at that time?
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:25:12
I guess I cant say much more than "sounds messy" but hope the BTC are returned at least in part.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:58:57
Also not if I die tomorrow. I'm talking about the current way things work and will work for a long time as an investor.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:33:43
Yes I understand these points clearly. I'm more curious as an investor how to promote as well as profit I suppose.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:03:31
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:11:22
I see, is there some sort of compass for high risk exchanges or potential hacks on exchanges?
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:37:13
I pay no banking fees in my regular day banking. Who pays for the appreciation in BTC? Do you also object to exchanges charging fees? There are transaction fees as well no?
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:14:35
It almost sounds like exchanges would benefit from some sort of mediation to mitigate risk for traders? Day to day stuff doesnt sound like it has the same kind of risk. 
Since I've not done any transactions I guess I'm unclear as to purchase transaction turnaround times to compare.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:47:29
I do appreciate the characteristics 100% however I have questions and am looking to address the concerns. Much of what I know is over my head to the extend it puts me off investing. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:43:43
I suppose I dont understand the difference between the wallet and the exchange. Is a wallet not a risk?
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:05:33
I suppose I go on like I know less than I do. I suppose I just dont understand the risk quotient but I appreciate the direction.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:57:16
Im not American so investing in US dollars already sounds like a bad idea, and I understand your reference to target but I do not generally hold loyalty to much more than convenience as far as retail goes; everything else is online purchases.
You're the first to bring up anything about Coinbase from what I can tell. Do you mind elaborating why Coinbase is different? Is it because of their average account size or because they're the only one who offers insurance?
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:01:21
I was thinking more like "shit-a-coin"

No idea, I figured I'd just toss it up to see what everyone thought. Whats the best way to get a script benchmark?
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:02:00
Total hash rate?

I think this is why they got rid of the Canadian $1000 bill. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:47:40
I really wish there was something out there like this for regular joes. I've been lurking since $1000 and just haven't been able to buy. One day.

For a second I thought the Trailer Park Boys just got a BTC
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:01:30
The-fuck did I just read. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:00:11
surprisingly quiet. A gentle breeze out of the top
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:07:43
But can you check email?!
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:47:32
Thank yee kind stranger!
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:05:55
Well look who finally fuckin' decided to show up instead of whoring himself out for cheese burgers?

Should I create a second profile on my mac with a password totally unique from anything else as well as run FileVault encryption strictly for wallet based stuff? Any reason not to?
I also have a mac mini server that handles my time machine backups. This happens under a general house log in profile (for media simplicity) but the backups can be encrypted, no?
