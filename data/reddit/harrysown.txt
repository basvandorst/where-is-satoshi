I think its combination of both. Someone is triggering the selloff and then selloff panic comes to effect.

The point of this post is that he says it is not a asset and also it is not investment. And then he contradicts himself by saying that IRS will come to collect taxes on money you made from this investment made on this asset class. 
Doesn't it make pretty clear from title?

Why do weak hands need to be shaken to go higher? Those weak hands are the reason that we are going higher. This isnt stock market that people can short bitcoin officially, all they can do is sell what they have. This is purely supply and demand.

Whats the point of this post? Either you are making money or you not. Clearly you dont have any bitcoins so you are not making any money. So whats the point of this post?

Do i need to remind u that this drop is not based on technical indicators? So mentioning ATH is dumb, its a news driven event, whoever gets the news first is in the money.

How credible is this news source? It seems like some sort of news org?

Everyone becomes "analyst" it seems when price is falling. Oh and other one is "I told you so".

Sell it quick so it can finally go up.

Robinhood is way better platform than coinbase. Unlike coinbase, robinhood doesnt go down every second day. 
And frankly, coinbase can use a good competitor so they can fix their shit customer service and their servers.

Well jokes on them because there's no revenue to be had haHaa.

It will be used even more. If prices go down then most of the speculators in it for easy money will get out asap resulting in lower volatility which makes it a desirable instrument to move money around and other uses.

People who are buying bitcoin for quick profit might as well give money to charity and get tax break. Or better yet, give it to me so i can put it to good use, which usually is buying good cryptos and hold them until the end of the world.

I think there are lots of shady things going on when it comes to trading bitcoins. From discord groups to CME that created bitcoin futures, big money wants to milk all the retail crypto "traders" that are prone to panic.   
Even coinbase which has now become institutionalised crypto exchange is playing its part. There's no doubt they are selling customer data to big institutions about when retail is most bullish or bearish.
