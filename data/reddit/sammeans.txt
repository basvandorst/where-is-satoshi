First off, Happy New Year!!
Second.. "Where is my BTC sticker?!?”  That's the question..  and YES we're just as pissed about it as you are.  We feel your pain.. We have to.. Because we’re Bitcoin fans too.  
Long story short, the first company we used for production totally screwed us and we had to switch places, when it became increasingly more realistic that they weren’t ever going to show up. The good news is, we're never using the original sticker company again and the fresh batch is on the way to us this very moment. 
What we’re trying to say is, you’ll have your totally radical FREE Bitcoin sticker very soon; shipping next week, guaranteed! So sorry for the delay, it won’t happen again.
Take good care of your crypto buddies.  
P.S. As an apology, the back of each sticker has a special promo code for 20% off anything in the store.. We’ve already added a bunch of new stuff and have some really cool pins coming next week too.

Dude, I'm seriously so upset with this place making the stickers. I don't know if it's a holiday rush, or what, but they are still very much in queue. They said it's in line on the next gang run, so they shouldn't be too much longer. I'd imagine we'll be shipping first or second week of Jan. SO SORRY FOR THE DELAY, everyone. I know it probably seems sketchy. We were just trying to make some bad ass stickers and got totally hosed.

We had a feeling the stickers might go quick, so we didn't order them until we added the second batch of 500 the next day. Unfortunately, the company making the stickers for us has a bit of a backlog. They are in queue and shouldn't take much longer... But, FREE STICKER! Promise they will go out ASAP :)

So yeah, just want to point out again this is 100% free. We aren't charging for shipping. Wouldn't try to scam you guys, promise! Anyone having problems with shipping, all I can guess is you have something else in your cart. Free shipping is working for everyone else, including me. Sorry dudes!

Still, not even close to stooping to his level of childish nonsense. I'm assuming you didn't watch the video. He's a big millionaire baby that wants everything to go his way. You can't just let him continue to lie to the new people coming into this space.

Shitty meme? ��
That would be the screen grabs with some overused phrase, typed out on Impact, complete with black outline and shot through a generator.
My intention was a clever use of artistic expression, to spread awareness of an incredibly sketchy person manipulating the Bitcoin (Core!) space. Not to mention, it’s a printable flyer and the nod to Twin Peaks is fun.

Great advice for sure. I assure you, we’re reputable people, but never hurts to be cautious.

Couple questions..
1) How much will this sticker be worth next month? You guys think the price is going up?
2) Is there any possibility of a hard fork for 2 stickers?
