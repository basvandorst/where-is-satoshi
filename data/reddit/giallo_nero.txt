Golden rule of Bitcoin, never bet what you can't afford to lose. What's happened today is a 10% dip, people weren't freaking out at a 10% rise...

It's not a crash. It's a dip. 
Your still 6% up on the day

Hmmm, I'll have a think over today. Would others use it do you think?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:33:44
Yeah but I think he meant speed/drop
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:06:00
That is essentially what Escrow does for other currencies and no, as far as I'm aware there is no similar service. yet.

I would put in half right now - Buying BC. Around $300 there will be a massive rocket/crash and a perfect chance to spend the rest.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:26:25
OK, bad feelings about Butterflylabs aside. 
If you were running it 24hours it would take you 4 days to cover the hardware cost and you'd be making around about $800 a day according to  but thats according to current values.
Once everyone gets ASIC hardware the difficulty will ramp up exponentially meaning your profit will take a massive hit.

00:07	skinnkavaj	gmaxwell:  &lt;- Apperently there are some nerds trying to DDos and create chaos on monday
00:08	CodeShark	operation april foolscoin? lol
00:08	skinnkavaj	I cant understand since the nerds that even know how to ddos should like bitcoin.. maybe its people behind alterantive coins trying to do it?
00:08	Perdos	what losers
00:08	warren	skinnkavaj: could be people wanting a crash so they can buy
00:09	Perdos	skinnkavaj: i've heard rumours about this kind of nonsense, bitcoin people talking about doing the same to ltc
00:09	skinnkavaj	But to get the mainstream media to write bad things about bitcoins will just be a loss in the future
00:09	Perdos	idiotic
00:09	skinnkavaj	Pure idiotic, it really defeats what we are trying to archieve here
00:09	Perdos	heh, anyway,  i thinks, not topical for this chan
00:10	warren	We're past the point of a temporary attack causing a loss of confidence. The March 12th hardfork had no lasting impact on the exchange rate.
00:10	Perdos	skinnkavaj: short sighted greedy/stupid morons
00:10	gmaxwell	oh, you're the same person who was promoting that in  too.
00:10	gmaxwell	skinnkavaj: you claimed to not be involved with it.
00:10	gmaxwell	skinnkavaj: but then why are you mentioning it elsewhere?
00:10	skinnkavaj	gmaxwell: I'm not, but since you asked for it i posted it again...
00:11	skinnkavaj	I just want to discuss how we can prevent and avoid it..
00:11	Perdos	warren: but an attack on an exchange might enable a double spend attack
00:11	Perdos	skinnkavaj: it's unlikely that such attacks could yield a great deal
00:12	Perdos	but then again
00:12	gmaxwell	Perdos: uh... no.
00:12	gmaxwell	skinnkavaj: where is this being discussed?
00:12	skinnkavaj	gmaxwell: It was posten on reddit
00:12	skinnkavaj	posted*
00:12	Perdos	exchanges should look for synchronised activity with DDoS and pay close attention to all tx's going on at the same time that could be users seeking to do the double spend attack

BFL have had some major issues shipping out their stuff and it's been no stranger to controversy - You'll see your order, sort of eventually.
By the time you get your board though, difficulty will have ramped up to such a level that will make it a token effort. Hopefully this is just a daft mistake and doesn't leave you too much out of pocket.

There was a status message saying it was lagging and they were trying to fix it. Probably related to that.

Yeah, I'd probably add an extra incentive like downloadable extras. I've been following bitcoin for a little bit now and finding it fascinating. Hopefully I can help out in my own little way.

Negative, the speculative bubble has burst and we fall back on the intrinsic values of the currency. If you're in it for the money then you're in for a nasty fall... it's a long game and it will grow.

Bitcoin will grow into a brief stable alternative currency before demand outstrips supply and other more affordable cryptocurrencies take off in the next year or so. If you have the money - dive in.

Considering it's just bounced $240 - the longer you leave it the worse it's going to get. When there is a dip (say $300 mark) then there will be a slew of investors waiting to take their place. If you have the capital - do it now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:56:32
"We are not shipping ASICs yet as we are still testing the chips. 
Prepayment is the only method by which your preorder is entered into the queue.
We are working to start shipping in the next couple weeks and have a backlog in the queue, 
so new pre-orders, regardless of product, will likely ship sometime in late July or early August, sooner if possible.
We ship in strict order of payment date with absolutely no way to move ahead in the queue.
Thank you for your interest in Butterfly Labs, and our products."

You could possibly do direct sales - maybe find someone to barter with ?
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:49:49
I emailed them last week with the same idea, they aren't looking to ship until July/August - don't bother with it, by the time they come out the Difficulty will have increased exponentially.

ASIC miners are the golden goose, if they arrive then they will dominate the mining market. IF. THEY. ARRIVE.
I'm looking at you Butterfly Labs
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:09:17
Don't do it, Bitcoin is not a miracle cure and if it fucks up then what little stability you have in your life, you will lose.
I'm sorry that your situation is rough but there are plenty of other ways. Look at Bitcoin as an expensive scratchcard, the odds of winning are high but the risk is still there. If you lost everything you put in, could you live with yourself and the impact it had on you and your family. 
If the answer is yes, then by all means go for it - and I wish you luck. But if the answer is no, then please try and resist and breathe a sigh of relief with being cautious.
I hope this helps.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:30:33
Thanks, yeah - that's the main draw about BTC is the lack of transaction fee to recieve and lack of borders.

The Market has been rocked by various attempts at manipulation including DDOS attacks, market flooding and other attempts - when the price bumped over $200 - it was a constant 8 day rocketship. When it became wobbly at $260 the price starting falling because of the market lag and flooding which would have recovered to around $220/$230 - but of course, panic sets in and a flush of selling begins. 
Market Correction, plain and simple.
