Their circumstances do not exclude them from being scum. I will call a thief a thief even if he is stealing bread to feed his family (albeit a thief one can easily symphatize with). And I consider people who would rob others of cash by way of manipulating their trust to be "scum".
Admittedly, the people they're scamming are rarely any better. They are (at best) extremely gullible and/or greedy and believe they have legitimately come into way of money. And make no mistake, many 419 scammers do indeed attempt to pass off the money as being "legitimate" and the transaction as "completely legal". "My uncle hoopla died and asked me to give 20 million to a kind stranger. I found you, Mr X, to be just the right man after hearing about all the good stuff you've done".
At worst, the people they're scamming are made aware that the money they're getting may be slightly "dirty" ("I'm a convict who's fleeing X country and need your help transferring funds out. If you help me, I'll give you 15% which is 19 billion dollars"), and said people go along with the scam anyway. These people do not have my sympathy.
EDIT: I believe there was also a case of a scammer taking advantage of a woman's good will (she thought she was donating to some charity or giving money to process an adoption or something). Will try to dig out the link for that.
Edit2: Couldn't find it. Did find a puppy adoption scam, though (

The difference is that we'd be on the winning side. ;)

Twas' a joke. I suppose if you wanted a serious answer, it'd be "No, because they're scum. And I don't feel particularly bad about the idea of a scumbag being hoisted by his own petard, even if the methods of bringing that about are somewhat ethically questionable".
