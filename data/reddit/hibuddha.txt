Plenty of people hate on luke-jr, he's one of the most vocally insane devs in crypto.

Yeah, really running into the ground right now compared to BTC lol.
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:34:11
As a name for BTC.

You're devolving into incoherence, maybe it's time to go to bed or stop drinking.

This is a sentiment echoed on by the more divisive users, you should realize you're just hemming yourself in on TA, insight on news, perspective and investment advice if you only believe what you see here.

Bcore isn't, I kinda like it actually.  What's wrong with Bcore?

Yes, you can see that it also creates use cases for other cryptocurrencies, since Bitcoin often becomes too expensive and slow to use during market spikes.  
Core devs could be handicapping Bitcoin because they're holding large amounts of other tokens that advertise low fees and fast transactions.

This post hasn't been removed, there's part of your proof.  I can link you thousands that have gotten users banned for mentioning altcoins or Bitcoin flaws.
Why are you lying and calling other users dishonest?  You're one of the worst offending mods yourself.

where posts aiming to find your destitute dad are welcomed, but mentioning that LN isn't blockchain, or anything about another cryptocurrency, will get you immediately banned.  
And you all wonder why the capital flowed away from "digital gold."
