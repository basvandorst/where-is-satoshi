What good is that when you don't have *electricity*?
My point is that BTC is a pretty good store of value....in some ways. But when it comes to serious crises, it's nowhere near as good as the kinds of things you can actually put in your backpack.

@_date: 2018-01-02 02:50:50
Dunno about that.
Zombie apocalypse?  Gold will still be useful. War, famine, natural disaster? Gold and currency will still be good. 
Heck, people were still trading with gold and jewels during the *holocaust*. 
But bitcoin? How useful would it be if you were living in Puerto Rico after the hurricane?

People who were around for 2013, what was it like? Could you see the peak coming, or did it sneak up on you?

So let's say I trade BTC for some ETH. Do both parties pay taxes? What's the point of capital gains on a (presumably) one-to-one exchange?

Nice try, Mister Trump.

@_date: 2017-12-16 04:47:42
actually its only capital gains if he makes a profit. if it loses value when he cashes out, he can write that amount off
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:24:22
That's....not true at all.
Just about every society that could work gold, attached value to it. If a significant amount of online infrastructure(not even all of them) got fried, it's perfectly possible that people would stop giving a fuck about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:49:41
there never was a lawsuit...

I think the only thing made clear is that you suck at anthropology.
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:28:12
To reiterate: yes, gold would still be valuable as humanity emerged fro the apocalypse. No, it would not magically stop being valuable.
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:58:03
Again. Every single civilization that could work gold has valued it. There are no maybe's and this is not a matter of speculation.

@_date: 2018-03-05 13:38:38
Fair enough. Basically I'm trying to brainstorm ways that an auditably-secure, or secure-looking, software could nonetheless be used maliciously. 
Here's a second example. Suppose BitcoinScam used the exact same signature protocols as regular old Bitcoin, and I started buying up Bitcoin Scams at 11$ each.  You sign a bunch of transactions sending BCS to me.
Since each address that I buy BCS from probably has an identical twin on the BTC chain,(and since you're probably hodling your BTC) could I copy those signatures  and reuse them to also steal your Bitcoins?

I've found that [it's surprisingly easy to store them in your head.]( I memorized mine in a few minutes, and I find them *really* hard to forget.
Obviously you still want to keep a paper backup or three. But at this point I'd probably misplace my trezor before I forget my seeds.
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:37:25
There's a not-that-hard [trick to quickly memorizing your seeds.]( You have to recite them to yourself every so often but it's surprisingly reliable.
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:26:39
And for ffs, spend a few minutes MEMORIZING your seeds. Its much easier than you think.

Good man. which technique did you use?
Don't forget a hard backup, but I find thats mostly for peace of mind. Once you've had them memorized for a while(with regular reminders) you'll find it easier to forget your own birthday.

Milton Friedman was also in favor of having inflation be regulated by a central computer.
One of the shortcomings of the Bitcoin system is that there's no such system in place.
