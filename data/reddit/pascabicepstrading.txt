Then give me a reason why Bitcoin core/bitcoin is better than the other crypto currencies?

If you invested in any other crypto, your returns would have been double bitcoins. Bitcoins growth is halting.

I think you should buy bitcoin cash. It has imo a bigger potential.

With that being said, why bitcoin? Bitcoin is one of the worst cryptocurrency out there though. I would gladly invest in something usable

I love the propaganda telling people to hodl and buy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:53:38
Why though? Bitcoin is so bad to be used as a currency.

Invest in Bitcoin Cash, come back in 5 years and name an arena Bitcoin Cash.

They could have leveraged which in most cases they did.

The more I look at this sub, the more I like to cringe. Although this advice is probably accurate, everyone is basically trying to actively pump up bitcoin. Every other post is BUY AND HODL. BUY AND HODL @ 17k, 18k, 19k!!!

Why would you buy at 19500? The slope was greater than a 90 degree angle almost. Why didnt you think a correction was coming? Everything was pointing that the market was going to crash with a couple hours of research.

Yeah, I own BTC just because it makes me money. I could really see BCH, LTC, ETH as currencies though. Even XPR.
I would agree that holding is good advice for a blind newbie, but there is much better things to do with your money than just hold.

Bitcoin cash is so much better for this kind of stuff. Other currencies are even better than bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:20:52
This is a bubble mentality. You don't want to pump BTC's price. Just let it be

if you are out of the country for a certain amount of days, you dont pay tax

They gotta be careful though.
