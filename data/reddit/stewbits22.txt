If they were so concerned for our wealth then ban bookies which are concentrated in the poorest areas, or they could just leave us alone.

Golds biggest use case was backing national currencies, since Nixon took the USD off the gold standard it has only kept pace with inflation.
What is Btc's biggest use case? I worry that speculation will drive price but not maintain above inflation.

HODL is that SpaceX terminology?

Not Nigeria then?
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:08:02
Great advice.

Andreas Brekken did the testing, his technical expertise and step by step analysis saved me a lot of time and trouble. He ran the biggest LN node for a while, maybe address the technical limitations openly would be a start.
@_date: 2019-03-21 11:55:24
Why did he do that Satanic pose on the Rogan podcast?
@_date: 2019-03-09 20:28:21
Communism? Naah I don't think thats what Bitcoin is about. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 20:32:11
As is evidenced in this thread communists are all over bitcoin. We cant have the goyim getting financial freedom.
@_date: 2019-03-24 21:51:36
This whole thread is really saying without saying 'should have increased the block size. LN becomes unecessary ( I mean who is smart enough to invent a whole new p2p cash system, when that is the revolution that is changing the world. The answer is no one and LN is a mess and will fail.
@_date: 2019-03-05 07:15:56
Such hostility for a common sense answer doesn't fill me with confidence. I am wondering why I am not banned yet.
@_date: 2019-03-05 00:46:54
Why? LN does not work reliably yet.
@_date: 2019-03-05 01:09:39
I will wait and see if LN can handle real commercial volume before using. I don't beta test with hard earned money.

You are the winner of my 1st ever down vote on here, congratulations ��

@_date: 2019-03-05 10:40:47
Appreciate your answer.
@_date: 2019-03-05 09:27:08
 None of what you said applies to me and the last line was rather unecessary and crude.
@_date: 2019-03-10 00:29:52
Ok comrade.

Better to use purse.io for a 30% discount, I have hundreds of dollars in Amazon gift cards in locked Amazon accounts after purchasing in good faith fron Paxful traders that were dodgy!
@_date: 2018-10-03 17:57:01
As a new user I think Purse has lower limits! I bought Amazon gift cards in good faith and loaded them on my account, then after a time I could not log into my account. I spent hours on the phone with Amazon proving my identity as the legit owner of my account! They suspected my account was hacked! Even after unlocking the account it would be locked again as soin as I placed an order! After several weeks of this I simply gave up and lost a good bit of bitcoin in the process!
@_date: 2019-08-21 08:33:38
Once everything is priced in Btc globally it will be mission accomplished. We must do everything to make Btc money for the world.
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:27:26
If Bitcoin destroys the central banking systen and all the sickos that feed off of it then its worth investing in.

Are we hodling or spending?
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:04:38
Why dont you do something?
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:04:31
There is no kyc at local.bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:29:31
Dont do it. Why would you show any exchange where your stops are. That makes you a juicy target.
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:02:43
The key to freedom has no price, Hodl power is all you need, who needs innovation.
@_date: 2019-08-03 05:26:23
Who is HODLING when exchange volume is 18 billion dollars or one third of crypto volume in total?
@_date: 2019-10-16 22:18:43
Without utility there is futility.

2011 is early what are you talking about? He was at the first ever Btc conference and bought Bitcoin when it was about $3. I will take my chances on him using me, thanks for your concern.
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:09:32
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:04:31
You people are either fake, sub par IQ or a joke. Roger Ver has done more than anyone to push Bitcoin adoption befor the split. The Stop Btc being cash campaign backed by well financed sources won the day and all they have to offer is Hodl, smear and block.
@_date: 2019-10-05 07:09:25
He invested in all the early startups to support Bitcoin, genuine crypto fans wouold be applauding him not using the same tactics of antifa and corrupt politicians.
@_date: 2019-08-26 12:46:17
Your welcome

@_date: 2019-06-30 20:53:35
I agree with you we need adoption but how?
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:11:12
You can buy goods on Amazon in exchange for Btc or Bch at purse.io. You will pay a premium but worth it if local Btc price where you are is much higher.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:44:23
Btc is the new shitcoin

Swing trade without leverage and play the long game. Buy at a discount from the last high (say 40%) and sell when new high is say 20% above last high. Context being an up trend. Tighten margins for sideways action and reverse strategy for down trends.

The first two books are not about Bitcoin then.

If you make a living in Crypto by selling Btc on Purse.io, then you would have had the opportunity to buy during the correction.
