Where can I check if a bitcoin is tainted or not?
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:51:40
Could you just but BTC off an exchange (from the exchange's LN channel balance) to top up your channel? This way you would only need to open your channel once, and with the same exchange.

I have checked the stats at  and it seems the top 8 mining pools together have 75% hashpower? So if all 8 of them plus the average joes upgrade to a new version of bitcoin software (a hard fork), is that enough?

I am thinking: saying "there will be a watchtower service" means that there is none yet? And if any party which tries to steal BTC, they won't be caught?? (Currently?)
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:11:56
It's ironic, but if the only people buying and selling crypto would be the techies who understand, we wouldn't have much of a market. For the price of BTC it's good that millions of people were convinced to buy, because "this is the future". The more buyers, the higher the price goes.

In most of the EU  countries the fees are limited. I think google could maybe get away with fee as low as 0.2% for debit card payments. But yes, it does seem that the bitcoin/LN is the biggest threat to Visa.

I'm new to 3d printing, still learning about the calibration, but yeah, I can already spot some things. You can also sand/polish prints for a nicer surface, that can work.
For business cards, though, you are better off with dead tree. The most common hobby printing material, PLA is in theory biodegradable, but takes months or 1-2 years to decompose in the sea. ABS is in theory recyclable, but will end up in the landfill and does not really decompose. The other plastics aren't much better either.

That's an easy question: made in China, of course.

Not true. If it goes below 5-6k, some miners will exit and thus the profits for the remaining increase.

As I understand, new Tether tokens are created when people sell crypto AND someone is putting USD into the whole system from the "real world" (eg. the people who buy the crypto).

Yes, that is true, but he still is rich.
His ways might not be the most ethical in my eyes, but they work. Example: he went to private property sellers and offered 50% of the sell price in cash. 19 out of 20 kicked him out in the ass, but 1 in 20 negotiated a bit and sold him their property for about 60-70%. So he kind of found the vulnerable sellers, and exploited them, in a way.
This is totally legal, but it requires some skin on your face.
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:45:43
That must mean internet is working there.
Because: no internet = no bitcoin transaction.

Use Revolut or Monzo for debit card spending. They will show any balance changes instantly.
For international transfers, use Transferwise, which has some fees, but those are pretty low and fair.

And that's when you realize ASICs are called application specific for a reason. At least with GPUs you could sell it off to gamers, but who needs optimized SHA256 solvers?
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:34:03
Yes. Though it means more 'centralization'. A smaller set of more powerful and funded nodes will form the LN 'core', and users will connect to edge 'gateways'.

Yep. Won't save McAffee's dick!
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:25:48
But how can you buy property costing that much (eg. 500 000 USD) for cash? Is it legal to give the seller a suitcase with 20 dollar bills?
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:49:56
2495 nodes? So that's roughly 2495 users of LN? Plus a bit more if some are merchants. Doesn't sound too much yet.

Anyone can build mining farms - who has enough (large) capital to risk and invest and access to hardware, and relatively cheap power.
For GPUs, anyone can just go into a shop, buy a GPU and mine with it (not bitcoin at the moment).
However, Bitcoin miner hardware, like Antminer S9s are produced solely by Bitmain, and it's certainly not as easy to just buy one off the shelf.
This means the barrier to entry is much much higher than with GPU mining.
Not everyone has $2600 to buy an Antminer, but a lot of people do have $200-400 to buy one or two, or more graphics cards.
For the proof of work, there were already articles:
"Bitcoin Community Members and Developers Propose Changing Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work"
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:20:04
Yep, I get that totally, but just waiting 10 more minutes (for the next block) and doing that would actually have that kind of proof for the previous commit.
I mean, in that case, the "previous commit" was made "before" that certain block was found.

10 year+ bet is buying Nokia stocks before iphone came out.
At the time, it must've sounded pretty logical.
Now, BTC can still go up or down in a few years, no one knows, people probably need some time to forget early 2018 until they will buy in again.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:58:22
Why would you pay with BTC on ebay? You have to pay transfer fees that way and lose buyer protection, if i'm right.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:01:13
Because bitcoin is decentralized, noone can actually enforce that rule, that would mean censoring transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:45:35
Actually, not less than Transferwise, which is about 2-3 GBP for transfers of around 300 gbp

I am thinking whether some of the (US) government knows who Satoshi is? I mean, they have one of the best secret service, the CIA, spies, etc. and mass surveillance at their disposal.
If that's not enough to find a person like Satoshi, then it's all kind of worthless.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:54:33
I think the Lightning Network can work and work well, it will be more centralized with some bigger nodes, though.
Think of the SWIFT system: you have an account at your bank and you can send money to someone else with an account at another bank.
A positive difference that here your "bank" can never take or freeze your BTCs, which is great, an transfers are low cost and very quick.

I am trying to find a good analogy. Maybe it's more like a private game of poker (not a casino).
If I play poker with someone else, and I bring 1000 USD to the table and he brings 500, we can leave each with 0 to 1500 USD in one's pockets after a night of playing poker.
So it might be me going home with 1500 USD (and the other guy with 0), or vice versa, or anything between, as long as it adds up to 1500. Of course, this is just the opening channel, the one "hop" in the lightning network, not the multi-hop channels.

It actually also went to 7500 for a short period.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:14:07
But that's the exact problem. To even enter the Bitcoin mining scene, you must buy specialised mining hardware for $2000-$3000 from only about a few suppliers.
How is that "decentralized"? Was that really the "Satoshi vision"?
 
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:07:38
Another big concern for me is the P2P nature of bank transfers: would I want to be associated (as a bitcoin buyer) as sending money to a drug dealer or mafia's bank account?? How do I know the seller isn't that? I mean of course later (in an investigation) I could prove my innocence, but still.

@_date: 2018-03-14 17:06:41
If the entry barrier is high (lot of capital needed to design and manufacture ASICs) and the risk is high, it's not easy to enter the market.
I'm surprised there wasn't already a mining-hardware ICO. They could've set up a company to design and sell mining rigs, and pay "dividends" for the ICO token holders from sales.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:01:07
True. Now we need a few months until people "forget" history and can be persuaded to buy in again.
@_date: 2019-01-19 09:07:29
Funny that the headline says "still profitable" but in the detailed comments you admit you pay $450/mo for the rent, $45 for electricity and i am estimating equipment amortization at $100-200. 
On the income side, you have about $350.
That sounds like a monthly loss of about $300??

@_date: 2018-03-06 04:31:31

Don't laugh. I have never seen such a thing in Europe. Is this some USA thing?
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:51:34
Yes, the problem is that 90% of the people will never be able to be that competent and responsible with crypto. Even today a lot of PCs are infected with malware because some people are just dumb with computers. Imagine if they had to manage their bitcoins on that machine. But it's not just the malware issue: accidentally send 1.00 BTC instead of 0.1 BTC - whoops, say bye bye to that money.
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:38:24


Transferwise already did that. They are not free, but quite cheap (about 1-3 USD/transfer) compared to WU or MoneyGram.

It doesn't make sense for countries to exit the EU, they just don't stand a chance by themselves on the world maket beside giants like USA, Russia, India. A country of 5-20 million will be easily "bullied" and be on the short end of the stick.

Partly true. You get the amount of money locked from your card (bank) account immediately.
Have 1000 EUR, spend 10 EUR with a debit card, instantly only have 990 EUR as "available balance".
So it's more than just authorization.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:41:51

@_date: 2018-03-08 13:00:07
Also, I would guess Amazon is probably paying only about 0.2-0.8% merchant fees for debit card processors in Europe. 
Bitcoin would probably mean much higher costs for them (or the customer).
If Stripe can process transactions for 1.4% + 20p in the UK, I am sure a huge shop like Amazon can do an ever better deal.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:42:59
Not necessarily. If people find out that 1-2 sat transactions are "blocked" by mining pools, they will have no option but to increase the offered fee, eg. to 5 sats or more. 
This of course only works if the majority of mining pools filter and censor these transactions, once a smaller (5-10%) pool or an individual accepts and adds such a transaction to the blockchain, then it goes through.
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:20:12
Yes but you cannot transfer crypto from/to Revolut. Only buy and sell inside their walled garden.
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:16:08

I just don't understand why bitcoin?
My company was looking for professionals 2 years ago, and then they said any referrals resulting in a hire and at least 6 months working time result in a $500 reward.
Actually if recruiters brought people, they would probably ask for $2-3000 or more, so it was a win-win for everyone. (Actually, a bit cheap of them.)
But now, is the above company supposed to buy bitcoins and send that to Coinvet? Why not just dollars?
Although there might be one advantage, and that is transfer fees, but I'm not sure that's an issue (there's always ACH in the USA or SEPA in Europe).
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:32:45

@_date: 2018-03-22 08:10:27
That wasn't a real bitcoin payment, it was a coinbase payment. I would guess it was off-chain in Coinbase's internal database, so it was fast.
Paying with Visa costs 0, so if there are fees for the customer for bitcoin payments, it's more than with visa.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:47:14
You are right, my mistake.
I mixed it up with the 60 million USD account (also part of the 442 million) which was "XXXX for the benefit of Tether Limited". XXXX here is an "individual" and not a company.
And there was an "engagement letter" with this XXXX to handle the money for Tether. But, FLLP didn't evaluate the substance or legality of the "engagement letter", so it might not be enforcable.
Also, "FLLP did not evaluate the terms of the above bank accounts and makes no representations about the Client's ability to access funds from the accounts or whether the funds are committed for purposes other than Tether token redemptions"
I seriously wonder what the auditors did for their money, as it seems, not too much.

6000 is the cost because there so many miners. If it goes below that, some miners won't have their electricity costs covered and will stop mining. Then difficulty goes down and the cost to mine lowers.

Doesn't saving that way take money "out" of the economy? If you're saving in a bank account, the bank will lend and invest that money, but if you're just hodling (like: money under your pillow), you are slowing the circulation? I remember in the 2008 crash, swiss people were holding off their purchases (eg. television, car), because every week their CHF was worth more and more.. so you could get more the same TV for the less amount of CHF if you waited a month or two (TV was an imported good).

There would be, actually. eBay + PayPal takes a nice cut of transactions, eBay takes about 10%, PayPal a few more.
The PayPal fees could be reduced, though it also means eBay would need to provide or partner with some escrow (buyer protection) services, which would also have a cost, let's say 1%.
Currently: "Once a buyer pays for an item, the seller's PayPal account is credited with the full sum, minus PayPal's own fees (typically 3.4% plus 20p, as mentioned above)."

It's a common strategy/advice.
Let's suppose you have a value of 50000 USD invested in total (stocks, bonds, bitcoin, etc).
Out of that, make sure bitcoin is always 10% (in USD value), that's 5000 USD for the above total number.
If bitcoin goes up, doubles, it's worth not 5000, but double 10000. So your total wealth might grow:
- from the original 50000 USD (5000 USD from BTC + 45000 non-BTC)
- to the new value of 55000 USD (10000 USD from BTC + 45000 non-BTC)
- This means bitcoin is 18% of your total wealth.
You don't really want this, because this leaves you more vulnerable, should a crash happen, than the 10%. So you sell off some of the bitcoin and invest that USD into other items (stocks, bonds, etc.).

This is when I lost my confidence in Tether (see quote below). I mean, really? We have to prove tether is fake? How? Only an auditor has that power.
 "The burden of proof is on people who are making claims. If you claim Tether is a fraud operating on fractional reserve, please form your argument and provide evidence. Tether has had third party auditors prepare memos demonstrating that there is backing of the tokens by bank deposits. There are multiple people who aren’t auditors who have seen the bank balances backing the USDT. A full official audit would clearly be optimal, but jumping to conclusions just because it is hard to get completed is hasty."

Well, if you would do a teardown/reverse engineer of crypto ASICs, I would guess you could even sell that data after, even if you don't actually design and a new chip.
I wonder what's the value of a 20% speedup (with same power consumption) in crypto ASICs? Or a 50% speedup?
If I'm right, it would give the same 20-50% income advantage of those who have mining farms where electricity is cheap. But how much does an "average" mining farm make a day? Let's say 100k$, that means they would get an extra 20k$ / day. Of course, minus the cost of getting the new modules/ASICs and setting it up.
The only downside is once "everyone" starts using these new ASICs, the advantage vanishes, and there's no more +20-50% gain, since everyone's at the same level.
