Coinbase is okay. If you want to avoid fees, learn about limit orders and trade on GDAX (exchange owned by coinbase). You can link your coinbase account fairly easily. Eventually you should do this.
Remember, always hold the majority of your cryptocurrency in a safe place. There are a few different methods of storing cryptocurrency, all providing varying amounts of security. Learn about different wallets such as paper wallets, software wallets (electrum, mycelium, etc), hardware wallets (ledger nano s, trezor)
It all depends on how much you are investing and how far you feel comfortable going to protect those funds. For example, some who have only invested a few hundred or less might feel comfortable storing their money in a software wallet on their phone 24/7. If you plan on investing over $500, buying a hardware wallet or figuring out something else that is more secure would be a good idea. With crypto, you are your own bank; you protect your own funds.

All you have to do is get the ledger wallet address and send your btc to that address from the exchange wallet you use. Seems like youre over complicating the process

This isn't "it", necessarily. Cryptocurrency is still a relatively small thing and largely unregulated. It is a challenge to the government. The govt of Dubai will start distributing their own Cryptocyrrency soon if they have not started already.
My point is that there's a long road ahead of us before it is adopted by the masses

If you go on GDAX and open "accounts" and look at the transfer history, it should tell you when the funds will be available.

Coinbase keeps logging me out. 3 times in the last month. I know my user/pass, but when it comes to 2fa, I dont get the SMS, therefore leaving me unable to access my coinbase account. 
I was logged out when I opened the app this morning. I was planning on buying more when it finally dipped but I couldnt. Tried for hours to get ahold of a customer service rep but was unable to. 
I'm pissed. Fuck coinbase and their bullshit. As soon as I get access to my account I'm sending it into a mycelium wallet.
Any recommendations on which btc exchange I should migrate to?

Leave coinbase ASAP.

I used coinbase since I started buying bitcoin. It's a very simple app. Works well for the most part. Their customer service is garbage.

Ill look into that. Thanks
