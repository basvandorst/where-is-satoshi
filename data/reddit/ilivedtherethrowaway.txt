1. Move bitcoin from coinbase to gdax for free.
2. Withdraw from gdax to your bitcoin address for free. 
3. ???
4. Profit

Fair. Maybe everyone should refer to them as joy and core then, and learn the history of Happiness as an ancestor of these 2 new products.
Humans and chimpanzees have a common ancestor, but neither one of is is that ancestor and we each have our own name.
Seems the only sensible option is to have 2 separate names and nobody claim to be the original

Most newscasters don't know in-depth details of the stories they read. That's how the news works. Sometimes they will interview an expert in a field.
It's weird for you to mention their gender so many times and even weirder you list your level of attraction as a reason they should or shouldn't know about crypto. Do you have to be ugly to like crypto? Do you have to be a man to read the whitepaper?

With BTC and BCH, I was under the impression BCH changed how it works, that's why that is the branch. Core is the same as it was before the split, therefore can continue being original Bitcoin.
I might be wrong, but that's how I understand it.
Back to the cola analogy, if you change the recipe you aren't the original drink.

You draw an s, then without taking your pen off the page you draw a circle round it. The lines would be added at the end like crossing a t or dotting an i.
See comment above that removes the upright lines, personally I think that's neater.

Thirdly, none of it is real so let's discuss things that are, like a banking revolution

Nobody has yet provided a good answer for this but people in this sub seem lightning focused so let me ask.
7,000,000,000 people in the world.
212,000 bitcoin transactions onchain in the last 24 hours.
That means 90 years for everyone to open 1 lightning channel? Never mind closing channels or topping up. Is this genuinely how bitcoin is going to work? How do we get mass adoption if people can't start using it all at once?

Rebellions are built on hope. This is the digital currency revolution and it is just beginning. Be part of this for your children, and your childrens' children even if you won't directly reap the benefits. They will be grateful.

Also from the future, op could get in trouble for sharing this information but is accurate. We won't see sub 13k between November 2018 and Bitcointember 2045 (we renamed the months due to how popular bitcoin became)
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:11:41
That's a great point. I wonder if OP will provide the source for their data on this very scientific post
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:11:06
If I were to buy a bitcoin using bitcoin, I'd be paying transaction fees so technically wouldn't end up with a full bitcoin. Therefore 1 bitcoin does not equal 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:23:54
A book store where you open a lightning channel, and tiny payments are made for each page you read.
If you don't like a book you started, you only paid for what you read. If you finish the book, you can keep it for reading again.

Yup. I legit thought I was in a subreddit mocking bitcoin. That guy is enthusiastic to a weird level
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:59:32
Lightning is a whole separate thing though. Surely bitcoin would be faster of every 1O mins more transactions were mined (e.g. bigger blocks) or the blocks were mined faster.
Also eliminating the features that mean 0-conf isn't trustworthy. Nobody wants to pay for something and wait 10, 20 or 30 mins to check it goes through. While it's possible, and easy to double spend (looking at you "replace by fee') there's no quick and easy payment with bitcoin.
Of all the cryptos I've looked into, bitcoin seems to be least useful for day to day spending but is very secure due to the hash power devoted to it. 
Maybe worth storing crypto as bitcoin like a savings account, converting so much each month to spending money in another currency (e.g. BCH/ETH/LTC)  then use bitcoin for large purchases like houses and cars, or online orders were the payment doesn't need to be immediate.
@_date: 2019-06-14 06:36:02
Could you please explain how it has the security of bitcoin? 
I was under the impression the transactions only occured between 2 nodes and that each small transaction wasn't written to the blockchain. Bitcoin is secure because of all the miners and the fact blocks need multiple confirmations, right? Maybe I don't understand how lightning works but I thought it was a separate layer that was only secure once settled on the blockchain
@_date: 2019-06-09 12:57:47
How will people know wallets are lost? Just because particular coins aren't circulating, I don't see how this would drive the value
@_date: 2019-02-06 18:41:05
Essentially, I think they're saying we consider what might be our limitations e.g. human reading speed, and they aren't. The real limitations are things we haven't considered, e.g. bandwidth of copper wiring.
People don't think it be like it is, but it do.
@_date: 2019-06-12 11:07:03
Yeah, lightning is a whole separate conversation. It doesn't have the security of bitcoin because it's not a Blockchain right?
I wasn't planning to discuss lightning in this thread but if you can explain in a way that makes sense I'm happy to listen.
From what I understand you need a Blockchain transaction to open each lightning channel, and most people will need multiple lightning channels. It costs each time you open or close one of these, and that process itself is still required to fit into bitcoin's schedule.
There aren't enough daily transactions for everyone to use lightning so this can never be a world currency while the layer 1 Blockchain keeps the same size blocks and frequency of blocks mined.

People could use it as a currency before it was a "store of value". That's why it was invented. It wasn't a feasible cash alternative when people were using it because of congestion. Bitcoin should be able to buy a coffee and be able to buy a house. Not one or the other.

Can you share your one weird trick explaining how you "came into some money"?
Lots of sexy singles in your area would also like to "came into some money" if you catch my drift?

Apart from segwit adoption being slightly higher, how have things changed?
If everyone decided tomorrow to use bitcoin instead of fiat, how would the network not be clogged and transaction fees through the roof?
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:01:40
The problem I see with that logic:
$2MM might currently be enough to retire, but how bad will inflation get?
If bitcoin becomes the major currency and you swapped it all for dollars, you could end up no better off than you are now.
