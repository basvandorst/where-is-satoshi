Bitcoin's biggest tech advantage right now is the battle-tested code.  Bitcoin's code has had the most eyes on it of any crypto for the longest period of time and changes had to be made at certain points to correct errors.
It is without a doubt that every crypto will have code errors at some point and certain ones will be catastrophic.  While bitcoin is held back by making changes very slowly, it is also safer because of this.
A fast developing coin that gets new features every day is amazing until critical vulnerabilities are found.

Right now you pay a fee for your transactions but it is heavily subsidized by the block reward and having plenty of room to put transactions in blocks.  When blocks are full, some transactions will not be able to fit, so there will be a market of people choosing what fee to set based on how much they want their transaction to go through and some will not make it.

BitTorrent has a problem that content is lost if people don't continue to seed it.  Laws and letters from ISPs have made the average person have zero interest in seeding due to potential risk incurred.
Private trackers are unnecessarily restrictive and pretty antiquated as an idea.  Yes, the MPIAA can get into your internet club and find all your torrents; it is a false protection.  If we could combine the incentives private trackers have with a smarter distributed system there is a lot of value there imo.

The problem I have is people have financial incentives to try and make alt coins appear more legitimate in this subreddit if they have some.  For people who haves used bitcoin for a while, they realize alt coins started as interesting spinoffs but now they are pumped and dumped by people trying to make a quick buck.
Someone holding dark coin or peer coin will post saying "why can't all the crypto currencies be friends?" And it will be up voted by alt coin users because outside of them, no one gives a fuck about your shitty altcoin.
I have the same problem with Dogecoin.  It's a funny "fun" currency, and people will keep pushing that, but the problem is when it's not actually funny anymore but people keep pushing it because they don't want to see it lose value.
And bitcoin is no exception, but it does get called out on people's "to the moon" related posts.  It's just people who want their investment to increase in value, not actually rational thought.

Bitcoin addresses all having a matching "private key" which is a random but meaningful string of letters that allows you to spend bitcoins at an address.

The difference between Google making rules and the government making rules is very large.
Google would make a curated app store.  You don't have a right to have your app in their store, so if you wanted whatever benefits it had, you would have to play by their rules.  If you are denied, you can spread your app by whatever other means you would like.
Government would have a curated... life?  If your app didn't follow their rules, you would be taken to jail, or ordered to pay a fine.  If you do not pay the fine, they will take your property, if you do not allow them to take your property, you will be arrested, if you do not allow yourself to be arrested, you will be beaten and subdued, if you do not allow yourself to be beaten, you will be shot.

I remember when I used to use Hulu.  I would much rather pay a certain amount instantly than have a show I am watching interrupted throughout it.  Not all ads are ignorable.

And this experience lead to a huge push for the lightning network.  The truth is people don't care until it breaks, so it had to break in order for people to be motivated to fix it.

What is "when the BTC price doubles"?  The BTC price has doubled over and over again from when it was $.00001

If you don't do it someone else will.  Patents suck but don't hate the player hate the game.

It's called a lottery

I would rather buy a $100 device and a WHOLE Bitcoin (more than a device would generate in its entire lifetime) than a wallet that costs $400 and generates tiny amounts of Bitcoin.

WTF is an AbbeyBitcoin?

It will appear on the network the instant it is sent.  Confirmations come on average once every ten minutes.

You need a secure blockchain though and how do you get that without the financial incentives of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-21 02:53:53
Oh don't worry they will soon enough.
@_date: 2015-10-25 21:53:55
This sounds dubious.

It is the "approved one" that hasn't really gained any traction.

Not because of any phony fiat currencies...

They sure seized a lot of coins for there to be more hidden.

You don't choose to use dollars because they are demanded as tax payment even if you barter and never use currency at all.

Money laundering is no longer using the money from a crime, it is now an innocent until proven guilty world of financial monitoring and regulation.  Accept too much money without investigating the people sending you money and you will be charged with money laundering, without any of the money coming from illicit sources.

"Masta" is strong and should not be underestimated.  Slaves didn't end slavery.

I'm guessing that GPS location services on a phone could be faked and therefore it wouldn't provide much security.

What is wrong with all of you?  You're acting as if a bank robber could walk around town with his big black bag of money and ski mask still on his face and have no issue going store to store buying things, and then I'm sure he can just go to the bank and deposit the rest into his savings.  A distastrous attack on fungibility, or the most basic level of community based theft and fraud prevention?  I think it is the second.

Are there any open source firmwares for hard drives, flash drives, or any storage medium like that?  How hard is it to get a flash drive where you can put open source firmware on it?

And unfortunate for the people that will be losing their homes after paying the fines for violating the laws.

The reason the blockchain is "secure" is because of the financial incentives backing it, which is Bitcoin.

[Good on Stunna for calling them out](
The best thing to keep businesses in check is always competition.

Which include not having an open fundraising.
