Blockfolio tracks you with their servers. Plus, this app doesn't use their own servers so as long as exchanges are up the app will work!

Sweet, the next two forks are named bitcorn (BCN) and bitcone (BCO)! Glad that's established.

That's because they dump billions of dollars into our ecosystem.

You're right, Bitcoin will never be a global currency. It wasn't meant for that.

If you purchase something with Bitcoin, the community is still hodl. If you want to hodl too, buy an equivalent amount of BTC at the same time you spend some. We all have to buy things regardless of what currency we use. If you are hodl, it is in your best interest to increase transaction volume.

You're describing deflation, which is exactly how bitcoin and crypto works. Hahaha

The general level of prices for goods and services is falling, as it takes less BTC (monetary units) to buy the same products than it took a year ago. Thus, the purchasing power of one BTC is rising. This is called deflation.    
    
Think about it this way. There are only 21 million bitcoins, ever. People are still earning them through mining, but there is a fixed total monetary supply. Make sense?

Any chance you'll make a string of these lights with more different tokens? I'd love to see more than three tokens, including EOS, BAT, XMR, XLM, ADA, TRX, etc....
