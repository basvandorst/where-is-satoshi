You could presumably setup a script to "lock" your private keys when you lock your screen. I think KeePass can do it. Most of these programs are written in such a way that they can overwrite/clear regions of their private memory on demand.
That being said, they could still distract you, and even if you're fairly vigilant, you'll probably make a mistake eventually. After all, the feds can have an entire team dedicated to taking you down, and you're just one person.

A broad-market index fund is a hell of a lot more diversified than holding bitcoins, or even a variety of cryptos. Even a house is a generally safer bet. I can absolutely guarantee that people will still need a roof over their heads in 10 years. That's not at all true for cryptos.
I'm not saying you shouldn't hold any bitcoin, or that it's likely to crash to effectively 0 and never recover, but that's still more likely than the entire US economy crashing to 0 and never recovering.

That's entirely beside the point. The loans exist, they're for significant amounts, and they're unsecured, so it makes sense that they'd have a higher interest rate than a secured loan.


That's a pretty dumb point, then. The risk of a random 20-year-old with possibly no income and definitely no significant assets defaulting on a debt is substantially higher than the risk of a bank defaulting.

@_date: 2017-12-15 04:15:18
It's a bit of a catch-22. Until Bitcoin starts being used as a currency, I don't think the volatility will significantly decrease.
Unfortunately, we're a really, really far way from it being used a currency. Yeah, you can use it to purchase things in some places. But the prices are always given in fiat and converted to BTC at that moment. When online stores start listing products for, say, "5 mBTC" rather than "$85", *then* it's being used a currency.
Which won't happen until the volatility settles. A lot.

Doesn't that also leak information about how much your coworkers are paid, and possibly even how much bitcoin they hold?
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:39:27
Bitcoin is very literally deflationary. The fact that there's a hard cap on the number of bitcoins, but the amount of wealth in the world will continue to increase (because people are undertaking economically productive ventures), forces it to be that way. When you consider that bitcoins can also be lost forever, and in fact probably around a quarter of them already are, it becomes even *more* deflationary.
This means that if somehow all fiat was replaced with bitcoin, the value of bitcoin would have to increase over time. More wealth + limited coins -&gt; each coin is more valuable. This creates a pretty strong incentive to *not* spend or invest money, but to just hoard it instead. Which is exactly what the central banks are trying to prevent, because when almost nobody spends or invests money, the economy grinds to a halt.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:04:40
It's still critically important for a currency.

Oh please. Lots of banks in the US offer accounts without any fees. I don't pay any fees and I get free ACH transfers, bill pay, check writing, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:19:55


I think it's basically designed that way. It's designed to be deflationary, which effectively means that you can generally come out ahead by hoarding your stash rather than spend it.
That's the entire reason central banks try to target a reasonable amount of inflation. It encourages people to spend their money (even if they "spend" it on investments).

Until Bitcoin is classified as a currency and not an asset - and, let's face it, in the last couple months it's very clearly been a speculative asset more than a currency - yes, you'll have to record the basis of each purchase you make.

Why do you think this? It seems really easy for them to ban. Simply regulate away exchanges that let you buy BTC with USD. Done.
Yeah it won't be gone entirely but most people aren't going to try to setup mining rigs for it here and no business will accept or pay in BTC. That seems pretty dead to me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:38:16
Anyone who put their entire life savings in what is effectively a speculative asset is awfully foolish with money anyways. They got lucky with Bitcoin but that doesn't mean they made a sound decision.
You could take out a second mortgage on your home and bet it on 00 at a roulette table and even if you actually won, you wouldn't be any less of a fool.

Exactly. At least here in the US, domestic bank transfers (ACH) are almost always free, and many banks have accounts with no monthly fees. Credit cards are very convenient - most actually pay *you* to use them, plus they provide a good amount of security through the ability to issue chargebacks.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:35:29
I disagree. If I use bitcoin to buy a new mattress, for example, I could pay anywhere between $400 and $600, depending upon when this week I bought it. That's a huge swing, even higher than changing gas prices.
Until bitcoin settles down and changes less than like 3% throughout the day, people won't see it as a currency.

Cute article. Interesting that they decided to use the much more useless nominal measurement to make the US look smaller. Oh well.
At any rate, if the US moved to more heavily regulate the use of Bitcoin, you know damn well that other countries will probably look at that too. The price would drop immediately out of its new uselessness in the US and would drop further on fear that other countries might follow suit.

Not really. You could create a smart contract system to safely transfer information, but not electricity. At the end of the day the electricity would flow and you'd have devices to monitor it, but it's still possible for someone to "short" you the fee for it. Not to mention just tampering with the damn devices.
Not that it matters in this case. If someone doesn't pay their bill you can take them to court. Or, more realistically, because we're talking about like $50 tops for a monthly payment, you just shut the nonpayer out of the service (even small claims court wouldn't deal with a $50 debt).
Or just sell electricity to the grid, which is way simpler anyways, and probably cheaper since you wouldn't need to build out and maintain the transmission network between houses.

Bitcoin isn't terribly stealthy, though. It's a public ledger.

They'd get a judgment against you very easily. Realistically, they'd probably just sell your debt to a debt collector and wash their hands of it. Then you get to deal with debt collectors and all the fun that comes with that for at least 7 years. During that time you'd probably be unable to get a loan, including a mortgage.
You could make it through without actually paying the debt in full, but it won't be pleasant, and could disrupt your other life plans.

Well the US makes up nearly half the world economy, so it's pretty damned relevant.


They have not. There are no laws in the US that prevent you from using Tor or from hosting your own hidden services on the Tor network.


Most piracy cases are civil, not criminal, the government doesn't have a whole lot to do with it. Besides, money typically doesn't change hands when people pirate stuff, so the reach of the government is limited there anyways. With Bitcoin, it does.
Again, if Bitcoin was banned in the US, then no reputable company would pay their employees in Bitcoin (which, along with government positions, makes up like 95% of employment). And certainly no merchants would accept it. It would become basically useless to anyone living the US.
Maybe it doesn't die entirely, but I could guarantee you that it would crash the market for it. Hard.

They could do that with fiat just fine. It would probably be cheaper for them, actually.

Yeah, my alma mater has been building new dorms. They're nice as hell. Honestly they seem like borderline luxury units.
For example, the old dorms were smaller and had no AC (I went to school in New England, there's no need for AC there, it's a nice-to-have appliance). The new ones all have central AC. Plus the rooms are all larger, bigger windows, nicer furniture, etc.
The same goes with the new academic buildings. They're very flashy, and they look nice, but it seems like they're focusing more on "how can we get our campus to look nice?" than "how can we rein the budget in while still providing a great education?"
Personally I think new student loans should just be dischargable under bankruptcy. Then lenders will stop lending money to people who obviously won't be able to pay it back. With the money stream dried up, universities will have to actually focus on their budgets, instead of engorging them with student loan money.
