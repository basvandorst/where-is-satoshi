I don't really like John Mcafee, but I feel the need to call out your bullshit. There isn't any evidence afaik that he had anything to do with the incident in Belize, I don't know the details but tbh it wouldn't be the first instance of corrupt law-enforcement trying to extort money. As far as his statements about the iPhone, he made it very clear that he was speaking on the subject to show that the FBI did not (or should not) need help with the phone. The FBI was trying to set legal precedent to more easily conduct similar investigations. He was also fairly obviously getting free press for his political campaign.

Disclaimer: I actually thing Ben Lawsky is supportive of Bitcoin but following orders (hence his soon abandonment of his position
The amount of comments on the second draft I believe is not only a result of positive changes, but also, apathy. Personally, after the initial announcement of BitLicense details, I was angry. After successive announcements, I did not care. Not because I thought it was not harmful. Simply because I did not think that I could have a positive effect, and also because as large as New York's population is, New York is simply a small portion of the planet. Bitcoin can flourish even if it is heavily regulated in a portion of the US. With time, the regulators will realize the reality of the situation. Ben Lawsky even mentions this in various ways at multiple points in time. 
Overall, I think that even with this being a semi-significant event, it will be more of a learning experience for both sides, than an actual push towards either side.

I think he was saying this is what he wants people to do.
BTW, Usenet predates the WWW, afaik it is mostly used for filesharing these days. I'm not very familiar with it but if I recall, it started out as something like a mailing list system for sharing text and files over a group of computers and users
@_date: 2015-06-04 02:56:41
That is an interesting perspective. As odd as it may sound, I did not consider Ben Lawskey as doing this for personal gain. Somehow I got the impression that after his research, he agreed with the general bitcoin agenda. This is probably his intention, and I know that, but maybe I'm just gullible and think he agrees with the cause/community.
Anyway, Lawsky, is a very generically acceptable character. I don't doubt he is capable of moving in to multiple fields and improving his income. Such is the nature of our modern world.
Possibly in spite of what I've said (and maybe public sentiment), I do not think that he is money-grabbing. This speech, more than anything else, spoke to the true reality of bitcoin from the perspective of lawmakers. If we don't care for the regulations, we will just avoid them. If we don't like the way things are, we fix them. Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency exists because we are idealists who have the technical skills to execute real changes.
I truly think that Ben Lawsky recognizes the futility of regulating cryptocurrency. Either because of his understanding, or his support. This is a small chapter in Bitcoin. Other countries have been so much harsher. The New York BitLicense won't kill Bitcoin....
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:08:29
We have been talking about this for years. The fact that a "regulator" acknowledged it is a win for us.
Sure, the uneducated fools that work in FinCen, etc, might try to control the future. We all know what the power difference between us and them is.
As much as they try to regulate cryptocurrency, we will devise ways to avoid regulation. 
Even if the internet becomes censored like some countries do... We have the technology ( that the US military created ) of Tor, and multiple experimental decentralized internet platforms.
We can do what we want. It's not about avoiding the laws, hiding from them, following them, overruling them, whatever. It's about creating a new society that doesn't give a fuck about the formal system. 
Maybe I'm an idealist, but bitcoin is a platform to change the world. It doesn't matter who tries to stop us. Like Lawskey said... , you can't stop software. We will control computer systems the way we want. Not only that, but computers are increasingly controlling our lives. Who wants to go back to the old times when we used fucking printing presses and couriers? There are some of them, but the bottom line is that we have more power... even if 50% of the world avoided our technology, we would still have an advantage.... It isn't a question of regulation, it's a question of software design &amp; development
Maybe I am crazy or something, but I think that this is a movement that won't be stopped via traditional methods...............

Yes. Although, usually when I've heard of torrenters having problems with Comcast it was either: related to their usage slowing down the network, or for copyrighted content. I've personally gotten a letter from Comcast for downloading a game illegally. I've also hit the bandwidth "cap" and had my connection slowed down.
The way I see it is that people will be fine as long as they limit their bandwidth usage and avoid copyrighted material from big-name corporations (some corporations have ways of watching for their copyrighted material being shared). 
Edit: Another thought occurred to me, that many [virtual] server hosts have restrictions about file sharing too. Again though, it tends to be about covering themselves and less about policing their users.

Usually if you can't find seeds for it, then it's also not going to be on netflix. Also, I can't tell you how many times I search for something on netflix and can't find it (then proceed to torrent it). They have a limited selection of good movies imho.

Money laundering is possible, especially if you are willing to give up a cut of the money to do so. I would imagine that it's more common for people who have access to the TPP to have access to money laundering services also, not that a middle man is necessarily required. I have no proof, but I think many people who get caught for money laundering didn't even realize that they were laundering money. Either out of stupidity or ignorance. 
Anyway, IDK if you were even being serious so I'm not going to rant about this. The only reason it bothers me is that money laundering gets talked about a lot in relation to bitcoin, and most of the time it is (IMO) just a way to prevent the growth of bitcoin's userbase.

Ripple was intended as a "bridge currency" or something like that. It was never supposed to stand on it's own and act as a currency in the way that bitcoin or litecoin intend to.

Here's a real answer: It's going to be just as risky as selling any illegal substance. Just because bitcoin isn't the same as most currencies doesn't mean much. You are still trading aka buying/selling. If an undercover agent trades you a pack of cigarettes for some meth, that's still distribution of an illicit substance. Make sense? 
If you really need the money, maybe you should take things more seriously and open a brewery. If you are just doing it for fun, just keep things d/l and share with your friends, if they compensate you for making them beer, they are just giving you a gift because you are such a great friend, not the same thing as buying a product from you

Do you truly think that liberalism is equal to totalitarianism? I would argue that liberalism is opposite of authoritarianism, which I would relate to totalitarianism. Many liberals do not realize that their beliefs align with totalitarian beliefs, but that is an issue of it's own. Most liberals simply believe that everyone should be free to practice their own lifestyle. Their failing is when they try to apply their beliefs, they have to push extremes to avoid cognitive dissonance.
In America, liberal mentality is extremely common, and many times it is not at all indicative of core beliefs.
You have a belief that liberals do not like bitcoin. In my experience that is totally false. I have attended bitcoin meetups and events, in addition to having many friends who are bitcoin enthusiasts. I would say that the percentage of liberals interested in bitcoin is basically the same as the percentage of liberals in any random population. Of course, my experience does not equal reality. I have also met many liberals who share the libertarian ideal of reduced government (in spite of the fact that liberalism is enabled through force, which I think you are hinting at)

I have developed a private trading bot for myself which can access Cryptsy, among other exchanges. I don't understand how to ignore fake orders from a secured API. Two ideas I just thought of:
 * A) comparing prices &amp; volume with other exchanges, or 
 * B) making it ignore pairs that change in value at an abnormal rate.
Neither of those solutions seem foolproof. I'm curious what you'd propose to make my bot invulnerable to valid yet incorrect data.
I do understand that in this specific case, there is one simple check that can be added to software using the API: if the bid is higher than the ask, ignore the pair. In fact, this is something that I realized I needed to add early on. Cryptsy in particular seems to have this problem quite often. At least, far more often than I feel is acceptable. Cryptsy isn't alone when it comes to buggy trade engine / API though. I've yet to see any website that I would recommend to a serious trader.

Wait. So checking if balances are correct causes them to be incorrect? I don't understand. I know that I have personally seen my account balance go negative permanently and the only way to fix it was to deposit money. It was during a big dogecoin pump IIRC, I traded a bunch of dogecoins and by the end of the day my balance was all messed up, I guess because of too many people trading or something.
@_date: 2014-11-23 03:10:59
Agreed. This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:49:54
Personally I would use it in conjunction with a database like PostgreSQL. MongoDB is fast for storing documents, which is exactly what it markets itself as. So maybe it could be used for storing data loaded from other websites, user created content, basically any large documents that don't link to anything.

Why is everyone excited about this!? It's like a certificate of deposit without interest. What happens if coinbase goes bankrupt or gets hacked or has an employee steal, or has a hardware failure, etc.? Seriously, just print out a paper wallet, and if you really are keen on the idea of trusting someone else more than yourself, put it in a safety deposit box. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:30:10
If they were using a big bad scary database system like Postgres how would they be the first exchange to implement every new pump and dump coin?
edit: also, this reminds me of coinbase, the "exchange" where you get a different balance every day even though you didn't do any transactions
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:57:34
This is actually standard behavior for an exchange. If you put in a limit bid order at $9999 for 1 bitcoin that is saying "I want 1 bitcoin, and the most I will pay for it is $9999, but will accept any lower price."
Some exchanges put caps on how high or low you can set the price, but this can be problematic with a volatile market. BTC-E had limits like this (idk if they still do) and it occasionally caused problems when prices went way up or down
The problem here isn't that Cryptsy is trying to scam users, but rather that many crypto traders are newbies to trading.
If Cryptsy is truly intentionally scamming users, then I don't think this is how they are doing it. The real place to look is the mining contracts and alt-coins. Most of the time when I look at the new coins they add, the github has no information, they have some shitty website (or no website), many times they have no volume anywhere but cryptsy, they get pumped and dumped a few times, then everyone forgets. How unlikely is it that at least some of these coins are made by someone at Cryptsy or some friend of Cryptsy? Then you look at the mining contracts, these are designed to lose value, and have a set "IPO" price. Sure you might break even, but in the time that takes you could have earned more money through interest. The only way to really benefit from these contracts is if you are the one selling them, or if you take advantage of the low liquidity (through scalping)
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:36:14
I like the idea. I don't know how you can assume Cryptsy is solvent simply by looking around in their office though.

Are you serious? The core dev team is paid. Anyone who runs a bitcoin site is making some sort of money. Everyone needs to eat. Everyone needs a roof over their head. Some of us have spouses and/or children. Some of us have dependant family members.
I think this mentality of working for good and working for pay being mutually exclusive is why we have so much corruption at the high levels of our society. We have folks like Richard Branson and Mark Shuttleworth that have proven time and time again that you don't need to be a charity or non profit to do something positive.

The blockchain is a ledger of every transaction that ever happened. Every block (at the moment) there is a block reward which is publicly (through the blockchain) given to the miner of the block. This is the source of every bitcoin in existence. A bitcoin is just a sha-256 hash on the blockchain. The first 50 bitcoins were mined in the genesis block, which essentially just says 'there are now 50 bitcoins at this address'.
To answer your question: a bitcoin is just an entry in the blockchain stating that you have a specific value at a specific address. Bitcoins are basically created out of nothing. It's like asking what an actual piece of WoW gold is. The important thing to realize with bitcoin though, is that the creation of the coins is heavily controlled and counterfeiting is impossible

Okay, here is the problem: Xapo did not deliver what they offered. There is another bitcoin debit card that has always been straight up about the fees and no one seems to complain about it. The only reason I ordered a Xapo card is because I thought it would be free to use my bitcoins at the store. There is no reason for me to use it if it is not free. There are dozens of people I can sell my coins to for cash at inflated prices. If Xapo said from the start that they had fees, people wouldn't be angry

Yes. I bought the maximum amount allowed with a credit card, i think around .35 btc. The whole process took me around 2 hours to buy and withdraw the bitcoin. I don't think i'd ever use the website again due to the large fee involved. I was kinda just feeding my inner adventurer/compulsive gambler.

Almost the same exact thing happened to me. Had to pay a loan on BTCJam which I took out for local trading. Five attempts to buy bitcoins have all been canceled because they are 'high risk.' Luckily I made just enough from mining to make a last minute payment. Otherwise I'd be late and everyone on BTCJam would label me a scammer. The rest of the bitcoins I'm going to have to buy at a loss just to pay off my loan on time. Now I have to go back to low-volume trading since the strategy of using loaned money and rebuying through coinbase is too risky.

I disagree 100%. I have seen multiple people, who I was close to, go through heroin addiction. Heroin is a huge industry and people make money all the way down from the growers, producers, suppliers, and importers, down to the street dealers. The newsflash is heroin already is easily available. A friend of mine became addicted at the age of 15 in middle school. His dealer was a high school kid 2 years older. The only way to make it less available is by crippling the current market which can't be done with violence aka the drug war, as we've already seen. Unfortunately the only way I see to help the problem is to make legal heroin sources with better quality and cheaper prices to drive the black market suppliers out of business. At that point you have to focus on harm reduction, which is ridiculous with a drug like this, I agree. The only other solution I see is to do some sort of genetic engineering to wipe out poppy plants that produce active alkaloids, which may or may not be extremely expensive and dangerous.

By the way, those swings weren't because of bitcoin being regulated in China. The bans were a factor, but there's no way they decided the price.

Hindsight is 20/20. You didn't know what was going to happen. I'm sorry you lost money, even if it wasn't much. 
What I was saying in my previous post is just that if you want to trade, learn to trade. Otherwise it's like trying to drive a car without being taught. Sure, anyone can do it. Some people even end up doing it well. But if you don't know the traffic laws you are going to get a lot of tickets and potentially an accident.
You are lucky you didn't lose a lot of money. I'm sure you tried to play the market in a reasonable way. At the end of the day though, no one can predict if the price will be $1 or $10,000 tomorrow. It could seriously change like that overnight too, considering the low market capitalization. In that aspect, Bitcoin is like a penny stock you know nothing about. We all understand the technology underlying bitcoin now, but that's not where the value comes from. 
Bitcoin the asset is like the stock shares from inventing email and doing an IPO to get the infrastructure in place. The cost to buy a share might skyrocket because of speculation, but how is email continuously going to generate revenue? 
Bitcoin has fees, but we can't run the network off fees right now. Block rewards keep people mining, but as long as we have block rewards we have new bitcoins entering the market. Supply vs demand. More bitcoins, same market size, bitcoins are worth less.

PHP alone doesn't prove anything. PhpMyAdmin helps the case a little bit, since it is **bad** for **critical applications**. Karpeles isn't known as a software guru, more of an enthusiast. 
*note that I am no guru either, but I do believe that layered security is a good idea, and the less exploitable software you have on a server the harder it is to find an exploit(duh). PhpMyAdmin shouldn't be on a production server, it was probably on there because Karpeles doesn't do local testing*
It would be interesting to compare the source code of the websites, and maybe the database structure. Unique duplicated code would be killer, but even similar styles could build the case against him.

It might not mean anything, but Mark Karpeles has been more and more active on the web recently (past four months). Maybe he felt like he got off the hook.

Your argument is valid. I think the downvotes are from "bitcoin zealots".... 
A counter point is that: in a world where bitcoin is widely used, it's inherent deflation combined with central bank note inflation would naturally increase the value of 1 bitcoin compared to bank note x. This still doesn't require the price of bitcoin to be very high though, it just says that it will increase vs bank notes.
 Also keep in mind a counter counter argument: If bitcoin is indeed widely used, it would follow that eventually bank notes become deprecated, after that point the value of them would be more and more meaningless (who cares if a bitcoin buys $100,000USD if no one takes the USD?)

So you honestly think it's a good idea to buy and hold? This isn't Proctor &amp; Gamble this is a new experimental technology. Sure maybe do that with a little bit of money, but don't consider it safe. Like they say, don't invest what you can't lose. 
The point about professionals might be true but it's hardly as important in this new market as in old markets. At least here you can see actual market price in real time.
Look, my assertion is this: When you are involved in a volatile market for a short time period rather than a long time period you are less likely to lose big. 
For instance, look at altcoins. If you are only in for a day at a time, most days you won't lose 75% of your investment. If you are in for 6 months you pretty much always lose 75%. This doesn't mean that doing either is intelligent in the long run. Every day trader knows that even if you gain 10% a day every day, one day you could lose 100%. At least if you are day trading you might realize how little control you have sooner. I'm suggesting that no one invests in bitcoin because it's primarily useful as an exchange mechanism, not a store of value. If the US goes into hyper inflation, maybe I'll change my mind. Maybe then I'll say holding long-term is a good idea.
IMO the days of huge returns through bitcoin are gone. Invest in startups that actually produce something valuable. Bitcoin might be worth $10,000 in 10 years, but how much money could you have made in that timespan actively using your money to make more money? 
EDIT: Also, if you are a day trader you learn signals. Of course you will never KNOW what is going to happen. For example though, I bet a lot of people got richer off this recent price dip because they had the foresight to short bitcoin. These people know a lot more about what they are doing than a buy&amp;hodler . I'm saying this and I believe in the Efficient Market Theory. I could have told you that once we gain a bit of selling momentum under $300 there would be a crash. It's psychology. I don't do any technical analysis BS, but I watch people, hell I read this subreddit almost every day.

Protip: If being bad at your new hobby means you'll lose money, you might want to research it before getting into it.
Not to be a dick, but you could have saved yourself money if you just read books and maybe took classes before trading. You also might have been able to get into stocks like your original intention. Most books on trading will tell you not to use real money until you have a working strategy, and have the discipline to follow through with your strategy. Discipline is really the big part. You need clear rules when to get out. These rules will help you know ahead of time how much you can gain or lose. The biggest thing you probably would have learned from your research is that it's extremely difficult to make money trading. You probably would have decided not to do it at all. To make consistent returns you need a niche. Any obvious strategy to earn money trading is going to quickly become unprofitable.

**Generally, if it can be done in C C++ or Java, it can be done in VB.**
Originally I was going to explain why I wouldn't personally use VB for such an application. I decided to save that for the end, and you don't need to read it.
People have created Bitcoin wallets in Javascript, PHP, Python, Java, C, and probably any other popular language.
If you are just doing it as a learning exercise, go ahead, have fun.
If you seriously want to make your own wallet with specific new features: again, go ahead and do it. Just consider what advantage VB has. VB might be easier (I assume this is why you'd want to use it). As you have seen though, it's not a popular choice for bitcoin wallets. The lack of existing code might be reason enough to try a different language.
- - - -
On the topic of the usefulness of Visual Basic vs other languages:
Personally I would use Java if I was going to write a Bitcoin Wallet. I hate Java. You can't deny how portable and universal the language is though. Java gives you access to more developers if it's open source, and access to more users regardless. Visual Basic is theoretically cross platform, but not in the same way as a native Java app

I don't invest in bitcoin actually. I've invested in miners, and I made a small profit with those, I kept a bitcoin when I shut them off because hey why not. I don't buy bitcoin unless I'm going to use it for some sort of good/service though. Like I said, I don't think you should invest in it.
I can't tell if you are serious at this point. Altcoins can make you some good money. How do you feel about people who trade penny stocks, or use massive amounts of leverage? Or people who trade these any of these insane derivatives? Most of it is gambling, but some of it isn't. I made money trading altcoins by arbitraging and scalping. Easy low risk money. If I could I would short altcoins because you know they are all shit, but no one wants to lend large quantities.

I've been looking over available examples of Mark's code and rereading old bitcoin code. I no longer think it's impossible for him to be Satoshi on the basis of their code.
I agree with you, and the bad quality of code we see from Satoshi and Karpeles aligns less with a bad programmer and more with someone trying to quickly get a rough version of their idea out. 
One person can't create a stable, well-tested exchange in any reasonable amount of time. The same goes for a project like bitcoin.
Maybe it's unlikely Mark Karpeles is Satoshi, maybe it's not. We can't tell by looking at source code. Hard evidence is needed. I'd rather have Mark in prison than know if he's Satoshi. There are much bigger problems in the bitcoin community than finding Satoshi.

not everyone has the same margin he does. I don't have a farm but I do mine and I had to stop when it went below $350. some people pay rent for their location, some people have higher electric costs. also consider the time cost, many miners aren't diehard bitcoin believers, meaning they will pull the plug and move their money elsewhere once they see a better opportunity
I'm not trying to say the price will go back up, or even stay here. I'm just saying that $152 isn't some magic number. My personal opinion is that since we broke the $250-$350 area by a significant amount, there will be a lot of panic selling until we hit an equilibrium. I'm no economist but I would guess that around $25 it will be much more difficult  for the price to keep going down. I'm not saying it wont go lower, but essentially what I'm saying is that we can't sustain a price below that anytime soon. So it might crash to $0.05, but there's no way it's going to stay there for long unless the sentiment is that bitcoin is dead. 
The reason people love investing in bitcoin is because of the inflation tapering which eventually turns to deflation. If bitcoin doesn't die completely, then I guarantee you that in 10 years, if you still have some bitcoins from now, you'll be happy. That's why people call it a zero-sum investment. The thing I think a lot of less-informed people don't understand is that when we say it's going to be worth $10,000 dollars, we don't mean any time soon. The people who think it will go that high soon are insane. If we get enough momentum after we reach an equilibrium, there might be another bubble. There also might not. If you are trying to make money here, either stop watching the charts for a few years, or invest in startups that actually produce something.

It's the underhandedness that bothers me. They could have made an announcement that they were switching licenses to combat copycats. They could have asked their customers how important the license was, or mentioned they were thinking of changing it (which would start discussion). They didn't do any of that, they either tried to sneak the change in, or are oblivious to the importance of licensing changes.

The way he keeps changing his defense makes me feel like 1) his lawyer is shitty and 2) he's going to prison. It doesn't matter if he's innocent of the charges at this point, he's shot himself in the foot. You can't say they broke the law to get the evidence, then be like "no man I didn't do that" then change it to "will I might of done this but not that" then "okay, I did some of that, but I was framed for the rest of it i swear" ..... If he had a good lawyer and a solid case they wouldn't have said shit until they knew their defense and they would have stuck to it until the end of the case.
EDIT: I don't want to say his attorney is bad since I honestly know nothing about the attorney. Maybe the attorney is good and Ross is just doing a lot of stupid shit. All I know is there shouldn't be all these statements from him before the judgement

You inspired me to look over the supposed mt.gox code, and old bitcoin code again. I take back my statement that you can tell the difference just by looking at the code. It would take deeper analysis to get a better idea, and since it would prove nothing I don't think it's worth the time. 
Both have the feeling that they were mainly developed by one person (we already know that's the case though). Both of them have bloated statements and general lack of structure. I would say that both of them had the goal of getting out a rough functional (if buggy) application. It has been said that Mark doesn't test his code. This would align with bitcoin not having automated unit tests until v0.3.24. The only thing that stands out with my amateur and quick analysis, is that bitcoin has better comments. Open source projects tend to have comments if they want anyone to contribute though.
Everything said, I am reading into this way too much. I am going to keep pondering it though because it interests me. It would be very fun to get a look at The Silk Road's source code. I'd also like to hear opinions from other people who are interested in this. There is probably more code from Mark out there that we could read to get a feel for his style.

His lawyer has tried to show in multiple ways that there is no proof that this 'evidence' is real. It's pretty hard when the deck is completely stacked against you though.
It's not as simple as just saying "that's not real, you are a liar"
edit: I don't know if all the evidence is real or not (obviously), but it doesn't take an idiot to see that this stuff could be manufactured evidence. Doesn't matter anyway. It's clear that Ross was involved enough to go to jail. At this point, it's just a question of exactly what sentence he gets.

This is irrelevant. What happens when the supply of bitcoin or oil is gone?
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:42:08
it doesn't actually matter much because once it re-targets, the supply is the same again. all this can do is delay the inevitable. bitcoin won't be dead until the user base shrinks so much that it is too volatile to use. if that doesn't happen, the floor will never stop rising, which is why people originally started speculating on bitcoin. 
what we should be figuring out is how low the difficulty can get before the network is no longer secure

It's actually nearly equally unlikely that desktop PC mining would be equal at a high exchange rate as at a low exchange rate. 
If the price was $100,000 tomorrow then you would make money until the difficulty changed significantly. The reason you would make money is because right now PC mining only gives you dust (i.e. 0.0000001 btc a day, I think the reality is even less) Well if that dust became valuable, you'd make money for a while. It wouldn't last long though because ASIC miners would start making enormous profits and certainly they'd reinvest all that money into mining. The difficulty would skyrocket until eventually PC mining is just as pointless as it is today. 
A low price would cause a similar scenario. Only difference it's unlikely that you'd actually ever make money. Before the time the difficulty is low enough to use a desktop PC, ASICs will get turned back on. The scenario where ASICs don't get turned on is where bitcoin drops to $0. At that point it doesn't matter what the difficulty is because even if you generated every coin until the supply cap you still wouldn't be earning anything.

okay, I definitely agree with you. I've followed bitcoin since 2012, and closely watched the silk road case. Ross definitely seemed out of place as the "mastermind" or "kingpin"... they pushed him into doing what made their case, and it doesn't seem like he was the original creator of the website. 
There is a clear campaign against bitcoin though, it's fairly well known these days and in my experience bitcoin is seen passively. Like, bitcoin is a useless virtual currency, pump'n'dump/ponzi/whatever scheme, drug dealer money, isis money. Bitcoin the currency is being subverted also, the focus gets shifted to the blockchain, or it's seen as a proof of concept. Whatever bitcoin is, it's definitely too technical, dangerous, and weird for everyone to use. That's the narrative I'm seeing.

On Linux you can use an experimental kernel module called zram which compresses the data for a block of memory. I don't know how well the compression works for bitcoind specifically, but it has had impressive results with some other applications I use. Unfortunately bitcoind has lots of essentially random data, which tends to compress poorly.

I think you are joking. If you are not, I want to say that the blockchain is really inefficient for, well, pretty much everything. It's a really cool system, and it solves the digital currency problem. I don't know that it should start replacing everything though. A technology based off the blockchain to do DNS would be cool, IDK if namecoin is it. Namecoin is IMO, more of a proof of concept than anything. It seems like the blockchain could be simplified and altered for such a use case.
