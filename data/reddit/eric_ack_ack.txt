If I used a flip phone for the rest of the year I’d be more productive and make more money this year. I wont though because I’m addicted to reading cringe Facebook posts from people I hardly know when I wake up.

I agree with this, know this and still do it. Even though I’m less productive in that time, i still enjoy doing it.

Just not how you trade profitability

He’s saying he’s buying on red days and selling on green days. Try this out and let me know how you’re going a year from now.
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:55:23
With this strategy long term and even medium term I think your chances are 0% of coming out ahead. Anyone who tells you otherwise either doesn’t know anything or doesn’t like you.
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:22:40
So you buy when it’s falling and sell when it’s going up? That’s some terrible strategy and you will go busto very soon doing that. Don’t fool yourself, you have been very lucky to be in the green from this. This might sound mean but anyone who encourages you to keep doing this is actually going to cause you harm.

Everyone was saying it was actually good for bitcoin when it got banned
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:28:51
You mean the average bitcoin redditor thinks they know more about the future of the worlds monetary system than the experts.

If it drops to 1k and stays there, will you apologise to them for giving them bad advice?
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:33:03
They are saying the fundementals look the same. Patterns on charts from different industries do a lot of the same things because of human nature.
Bitcoin doesn’t have to turn a profit but at some point it’s use needs to justify its price. I don’t think anyone would disagree that it’s value to value of use is inflated today but people are banking on it being of a higher use value and therefore price value in the future.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:08:56
The right answer would be “I don’t know” and not a confident yes. I doubt it will go to 1k in the near future but I still think it’s over valued by a decent amount today.
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:30:43
Yes it can.

Fooled by randomness
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:00:53
Although I strongly disagree with the way you are valuing it as a currency, at least you have thought about how much you believe it’s worth and are buying based on the price being lower than you believe it’s actual worth is.

You mean the next high is when you will be doing Facebook statuses about how everyone should be buying crypto but of course tell them not to invest more than they are willing to lose so it’s not your fault when it goes down and they hate themselves

Buffet probably understands it better than the crypto experts here but the difference is he knows what he doesn’t understand
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:20:38
Do you have experience trading currency’s or are you more from a stocks &amp; finance background?
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:07:02
Just out of interest, what percentage chance do you think bitcoin will be worth over 100k in 10 years and what chance do you think it will be worth under 1k?
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:12:11
Yet 0% do

It’s like people go to university or college for 4 years and still don’t know what the hell they are doing. The same people learn about blockchain and bitcoin for 4 hours and are experts. Real traders &amp; funds wait for opportunities like this to collect free money from the 4 hour experts.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:57:03
It does have some value for its use. That value is just way under what it’s priced at.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:02:12
Somewhere below it’s real value which is likely between $200 to $1200.

Yep the people who invest with emotions lose money to the ones who don’t.
