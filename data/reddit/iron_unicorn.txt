Overthrow the government? Nah. Obsolete the Federal Reserve? Yes please

I love this. Its important to remember the true purpose of bitcoin: decentralization of wealth ownership. Its easy to get caught up in the hype of "to the moon!" and "hodl to 20k" but at the end of the day it's making the big banking cartels sweat.

True, we have to convert it back into dollars before we can withdraw or trade stocks. But I don't see any reason why the ETH wouldn't exist.

Idk, my fianceé is Chinese and she is highly skeptical. I've been trying for ages to show her that bitcoin is the future and she still hasn't bought in. Apparently other Chinese girls are more open to this idea!

So you're saying it would be unwise to buy cryptos on Robinhood? Fair enough. I appreciate your reasoning.

Yeeaahh that's the problem with hodling. I sold enough back when it spiked just to break even with my initial investment to satisfy her concerns that I'll lose money. She views it as too risky of an investment, but I legitimately believe in the technology and want to hodl!

I can't say that does much to legitimize bitcoin...

This. I look at cryptocurrency as a way to revolt against the Federal Reserve system. Instead of trying to stop the central banks through conventional means, mass adoption of bitcoin simply makes them obsolete.

Thanks m8, I appreciate your views. I also appreciate how we are gaining friends in high places. This helps legitimize crypto for mainstream adoption. I personally adopted crypto not as a moneymaking venture but as a way to obsolete the US Federal Reserve. Seeing a man in the US government not acting like a corporate shill is very refreshing!

As an avid Dragonball fan I heartily agree with you. BTC will go super saiyan once again!

I love seeing good news like this, it really helps mitigate the FUD.

I don't know what you're talking about, that's Tim Allen from the Santa Clause.
