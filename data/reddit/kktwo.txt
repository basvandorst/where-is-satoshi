People like you are the reason I've never posted here before. The one and only reason. The attitude of Bitcoiners is pathetic and annoying. You can't even ask for help on IRC without getting flamed. Congrats on alienating more and more people from your currency.

You being Bitcoin as a whole, not you as an individual.

Well said. I'm 30 and I've never donated to any charity before. I've been mining dogecoin since launch and can proudly say I supported giving water to people in Kenya and sent some Jamaicans to the Olympics.
Do I care they came last? Absolutely not. It was their dream to go and if it made them happy and gave me a laugh thinking of cool runnings then I'm as happy as can be.

Funny thing is, you throw abuse around and make a negative feeling in this sub to anyone new. The opposite happens in that place that won't be named. Even people insulting Bitcoin there get downvoted and told to act more mature as we're all in it together. 
Then you wonder why people think it's unfriendly here ?

He's currently staying in a hotel in Japan with one of his moolah staff and Chelsea his moolah pa. They stupidly posted it on Facebook. Staying at the Hilton no less. Just go look at those room prices and you'll see where people's investment is going.

Wow that is awesome. I'll check that out right now thanks!  I've been away from the sub for a number of months now so I've missed out on a lot.

I was a Bitcoiner first. Still am. Nice attitude you have going for you.

So the negative is you can't sit in your basement hoarding coins trying to get rich? 
Sorry, I already covered that with the statement that it's a coin meant to be spent rather than hoarded. 
I'm also sorry that you think giving water to kids in Kenya is a stupid cause to donate to.

Then they wonder why people think Bitcoiners are up their own ass. Because of people like him.

Thanks I'll check them out!

Depends what you define as sucking. Great community, fun, raises money for fun things, doesn't take itself seriously, intends to be a coin to be spent rather than hoarded.
Negatives ?
