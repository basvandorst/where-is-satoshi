I'm not trying to start an arms race here.  Hardware wallets have not been shown to be vulnerable to attack, especially Ledger which uses a secure chip for protection (vs Trezor which uses software).  If you want bomb-proof protection, look at something like Xapo.

It is, until it isn't.  When it comes to protecting your investments, you should be conservative.

Coinbase is also a juicy target.  Say it gets hacked; do you really want to wait around for an insurance payment?  What if the insurance company files bankruptcy due to the magnitude of the losses?
Using a hardware wallet is a no-brainer to protect your investment.

I wish I had a nickel for each time someone proclaimed Bitcoin will/would be fucked if _______ happens.

What if it hits $25K, then immediately dumps to zero.  Tattoos should be things that you are, not things that you currently have.

Because BTC is:
1) the main trading pair for all teh coins, and;
2) the daddy.  
Daddy somehow immaculately conceived lots of children, but all were born stupid.
ETH is the mommy and she fucked around a LOT, like a lot a lot.  She had a few children that grew up to make something of themselves, but the other hundred still live at home and pretend to be looking for a job.

I can already tell that you are in trouble.

That little stinker has research to do then.  Teach them young to wipe their own ass or you're going to be doing a lot of ass wiping in grade school, high school -- then in prison, worse things will happen to their ass.  Not as slippery of a slope as it may seem to the untrained eye.
