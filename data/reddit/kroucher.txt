I'm not sure how rebooting it would give the chance of loosing the Blockchain, it's just a database of transactions. Only if the Synology is setup as a stripe raid for speed and it's just the chance of data loss that he's talking about? Unless the docker software for Synology is still in beta and has bugs, I'm not sure.

Actually going really well hey. It definitely seemed that after a long time of having it open it would not update properly or just freeze up, so I'll have a better idea by the end of the day. Thanks!

You just answered your own question (safety deposit box/safe)

I guess you're right, I more mean that due to telnet's nature, you are at the whim of whatever you're connecting to, and what it's allowing to receive command-wise. This connection is just offering dynamically updated text which you can't customize from your client.

Ah yeah, nice, clean and simple, but no Coinbase which is my primary buying platform.

Yup lifetime contract owner here, even then the return is reaaalllyyy low and the ROI point is like 4-5 years away, and that's on 0.4TH/s. I just like to think of it as $60 that I could afford to spend on this hobby of a rollercoaster ride of learning about BTC and the mining behind it.

You can always redownload apps that you have downloaded before, even if they get pulled. Take AlienBlue for example, a Reddit app for IOS that's no longer available, can still find it in Updates &gt; Purchases &gt; Not on this device.

Rough math shows ETH has grown 35% since when I personally bought (just after Jan2017 crash) and only 20% for BTC.

Unless you have pretty much any router made in the last 10 years that supports UPNP and will map the port for you.

I wouldn't say terrible user experience, it's just running a full node as well as a wallet. Of course people don't need to have the whole blockchain sitting on their HDD to be able to make a transaction, but most people new to Bitcoin are often directed to Bitcoin Core in order to get up and running (not knowing what 'up and running' means), I know I was and felt the same worry that OP had.

Article has nothing to do the with the title, and why the fuck is there a random kangaroo up the top?

I keep seeing 'more stability, less volatility' etc, what kind of time frame is this? The market is the complete opposite of stable at the moment, how long before we see these beneficial effects?

Except when you switched 'banks' from BTC to bcash, you moved from an actual functioning bank to a bunch of beggars with a sign that says "b

1. ETH supply is limited, it's just extremely high, because the main purpose is not supposed to be value drawn from supply and demand, it's to utilise the Ethereum network, and to prevent large scale attacks causing them to be extremely expensive.
2. Resiliency comes with time. I bet no media article was boasting about how good/strong Bitcoin was in 2013.
3. If you can't change an issue with your protocol for the good of the future of the network, then your ego is above your technical capabilities.
