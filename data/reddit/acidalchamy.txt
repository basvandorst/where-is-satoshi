Or just pay attention to all the dumb hype that happens time to time, some times renters are willing to pay 10-50% above going rates that the rentals yield just so they can mine a new coin with your hash or to try a new system out or to test their own pools out. I have a friend who for months dominated all rental sites dumping thousands of btc just to host own pool and test network, was amazing for him and amazing for the renters as well. I am currently mining out right normally with about 40 TH but at any second I am willing to switch em to rentals if prices shows obvious reasons to do so. Play it smart, maximize profits, don't miss out.

I am honestly speechless about this. Very impressed and very happy for you to have gotten your funds back! 
@_date: 2016-04-18 16:26:33
Sites like nice and west hash are only accepting bitcoin as payments, this is normal for most rental sites. The goal when renting is to pay less btc per Th then what the Th yields in a day. Easy to figure out. Check Bitcoin wisdom for what the current rate is for 1 Th. for example let's say 1 TeraHash yields .00100 a day, you would want to pay less then that; you ALWAYS have to factor in the sites service percentage (usually 1% on both ends, the rental site; and the pool your mining into) so this makes it so you'd have to pay less then .00098 just to brake even your goal would be to pay as low as possible. This works best with PPS because you can do accurate math. With ppnls you'll be taking a gamble either way on winning or losing. 
So the lesson to renting, do the math; if it adds up; it's worth it; if it doesn't; it doesn't lol :)
I've personally found 5 blocks renting for the private pool I was apart off but I've also (now) dumped 70 Bitcoin into my rentals wallet lol. So you win some you lose some ;) 
@_date: 2016-04-18 20:22:09
yeah but I wasn't ready to blame the bitcoin payment function. I had opened and placed the order through ZeroApp newsfeed App on my iOS device, returned bad Java or something which as we know isn't supported via iOS, but I'm sure if I would've opened it normally in safari It would've adapted and worked. Either way! Happy I placed the order, looking forward to putting these on the coins before taking them to the bank! 
@_date: 2016-04-07 23:19:25
I mean I use coinbase to buy bitcoin and sell it as well as send it around as I need it. Never had any major issues; I've never replied to their "interest" emails about my volume of coins being moved. I also have Coinbase tied to a bank account I specifically use for online sales/purchases and whatever other internet expense I have. This limits the activity on my bank account, and keeps things easy for me. But again, never had any problems with coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 23:34:22

well I mean to some thats a lot, for my pool 2 blocks a day is what we need bare minimum not to fall behind. So for someone like 21 inc to mine two blocks, it would be cool to either figure out if they've gotten a bunch of hash; or simply got lucky. Gonna try to monitor to see if they find any more quicker, or just consistently. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:36:53

We did some test a few weeks ago when we found out about the hashrate exploit, and of course BW was a victim to the vulnerability in the pool. 
You can literally repeatedly send the same hash to the pool over and over and over and over and over again, showing your hashrate as a miner of let's say 20 PH when really it's just 30 Th ping ponging back and forth with a different ending HEX.
Pool OP now has to go back in DB and verify that every share submitted was a legitimate share and that they weren't taken advantage of, though of course BW was. 
This ping ponging hash doesn't find blocks, just represents a fake hash rates, though the pool thinks it's legit so they will pay you out for the hash your account has, fake or not.
We fixed this in our pool; and hope they do to.

Finding blocks is all luck. each single share has the same equal chance as the next to find a block. Technically the more hash you have, the greater the chance of finding a block (in a sense..), But having a pool full of fake hash thats really just riping the Pool OP off, thats a little different.
So yes, they have had a nice streak.
But ALSO yes, the huge hash jump is people using the exploit on BW

I live in the States and live in a place with a nomral price of electricity which isn't on the low side. But..... My neighboring state has incredibly cheap electricity so now, we have two farms. One located in this state, and one in the other. 
Even in this state we profited from ALL of our small to large scale mines. Only trouble we have here really was battling heat problems from the climate. Some of us have even found simple loop holes here with the electricity company to get very cheap electricity for at home mines. 
Our goals were to always see a return on our investments (ROI) from anywhere to 30 - 60 days and I would have to say we did just that. We also did a lot of trading on the side and other investments that helped shorten days till ROI. 
So in our situation, theoretically after 30-60 days we get to make the decision to either reinvest our income from mine  to expand it and reset the ROI date. Or, to simply leave the rig alone and let it pay for its maint. fees and you can keep the rest and start saving bitcoin or start cashing it out or whatever you want to do. 
We've expanded both a few times to where we are comfortar with how they perform and the income they provide.
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:05:55
Switching pool or not wouldn't result in a network overall going down or be missing. We were at 948 PH and now at 735 PH that's 200! 200 PH lol. I dunno about you guys but I've been in some amazing farms, and to even physically try to visualize 200 PH missing or offline, sitting dormant some where is pretty hard to do lol...

Only takes me about 5 minutes to completely finish my taxes. I think the service fee is well worth it, keeps it nice and easy for me.

To another IP? Do you mean stratum/pool? Wouldn't make sense to do that if it was 40 Ph/s of pure Bitmain hash. And for exactly 40 Ph's to drop (sure... Not EXACTLY 40) is still a little odd. Plus, then we wouldn't have seen a 100+ Ph/s network drop in last few days if it was simply shifted else where.

@_date: 2016-01-14 16:35:08
Lulz... I'm fully aware of how that works. But for one company alone to drop 40 Ph's is fairly big. We were close to 900 the other day. We are at low 800 now. Again; that's fairly big for a 1-3 day shifting. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:33:58

@_date: 2016-01-14 16:24:54
Bitmain drops 40+ Ph/s. Possible loss of a farm? Unplugged older hardware? Regardless, 40 Ph/s is a lot and the network all together has gone down a substantial amount in last few days (which still doesn't "seem" to matter considering diff is still increasing increasingly fast!)

Could still SORTA happen with btc... And it does... Hard to see it happening over a dispute from a sale; but the place you do BANK your coins with (if you do use a bitcoin financial institution/third party/hot wallet) then they could simply lock your account over a clerical error and stop your access to your funds... Just saying :) 
I've bought some nice $800 items/accounts before for online games and I've always made sure my large purchases were going to be worth it in every way for me.

@_date: 2016-06-06 08:54:54

Set up your investments and don't check daily, Check them ones a week; ones a month whatever is the absolute max limit to let time lapse. 
I've learned to leave some of my out sourced investments take care of them selfs, I've also invested into some trading software (Haasbot) to do some trading for me; I celebrate that ones a week or when a huge change occurs.
But be happy bro!
Be happy your a apart of something beautiful, take pride in what you've done, what you've created; but don't forget also how amazing life outside crypto is.
The amazing feeling I get sitting in a nice green big part and thinking about crypto is insane, almost euphoric.
We've come so far, and it's only the beginning; take what you've learned and embrace it but don't let it get the most of you :)

"copypasta for every time a post like yours comes up:
Copied from the last time this came up:


If your the guy on the internet that believes that every situation is always the same, you must live in a very small town, in a very small bubble in a very small apartment who sadly has access to the giant world wide web. Dont think all 2 situations are the same my friend.
We have a 25,000 SqFt Tier 2 Data Center where we are currently hosting 5 Ph/s. BTM's are poping up every where inside of our casinos and the only thing that is missing is the publics eye on all this.
We all at our DC Vape daily (probably more then what we should), So wouldnt seem logical for us to pitch something to the vape store, not only for us as Bitcoin Users but for a small business to avoid taxes and fees.
and yes...we do have our own stores, and e commerce, we know exactly what it takes to start accepting bitcoin; not much to it honestly...
So again, go outside and realize that the world is bigger then the 10 topics you've found with people with similar concerns, as much time as you spend working against the community with your nonsense posts, you should really consider helping out.

That was honestly a pleasantly nice break-down paragraph to read.
Kudos to you for helping others understand this.

At max verification at Coinbase you'll get this:
"Your limits
Buy limits	Your buy limit is the amount you can buy across all enabled payment methods.	
$50,000 daily limit remaining max $50,000
When using a bank account, there are additional limits on how much you can buy.	
$1,000 weekly instant buy remaining max $1,000
$50,000 daily limit remaining max $50,000
Sell limits	Your sell limit is the amount you can sell."
Not to shabby, mix that in with a few other vending websites and you can buy a nice amount daily, weekly, and/or monthly

I was wearing a bitcoin hat at my doctors office and my doctor was sorta mocking Bitcoin saying "it isn't real" which is when I informed him I used my Bitcoin Shift Debit Card to pay for that appointment and my meds :) guess that makes his practice  worthless if he's accepting currency that isn't real!

With modern technology it's pretty easy to kill a whole row, section, room, area down from a short or anything else as such... I'm fairly sure this big investment is properly taken care of. Not to mention, believe they use hydro electricity for this mine, with water close by; I'm sure a simple fire hose is set up. Everything in their has paid for its self well over by now...

That's a nice bit of handy info, thanks ;)

Pretty interesting. From their unfortunately their is a $300-$500 cash atm withdrawal limit (this is why I've made everyone i know  a business debit card to help move the funds around). But on the other hand you'll be able to use the debit card freely as a normal debit card to spend the funds. Might as well also set this up just for shits and giggles.

That wouldn't even get close to leveling the playing now field, but whatever.

Logos in menu should go on the left hand side. On iOS they are a bit scattered on right hand side
