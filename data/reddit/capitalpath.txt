I saw this project [ so I guess maybe? It would probably be slow but someone should try for science

I've setup my first lightning node, exciting times!
@_date: 2019-03-10 16:41:40
ye so the whole linux distro is running in the background including bitcoind, lightning and tor. I have an old moto g5 with 2gb of ram. Right now Im using chroot which requires a rooted phone. However it might be possible to get it running using proot like termux or UserLAnd

nice detailed explanation!
@_date: 2019-03-10 16:01:54
I have an android phone which runs a linux distro(using chroot). To store the blockchain I use a 400gb sxdc card. I plan to write a blog post detailing the steps
@_date: 2018-10-24 16:16:06
Ahh I thought it would be running a bitcoin node
@_date: 2018-10-24 16:27:16
Shameless plug, my friend sells these [phones]( which actually run a full bitcoin/lightning node
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:59:21
nice! it runs without root aswel!
@_date: 2019-03-11 00:11:03
ah kool, maybe add HiddenServiceVersion 3 to get v3 onion address(not sure if it defaults to v2, I think v3 is like 56 characters)
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:07:31
Here's my site giving out sats once your channel is open with inbound liquidity,  . Nobody likes ads but it's a quick way to play around with lightning :)
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:59:35
Have a go at 
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:19:12
thx u/veganic11, ads4satoshis is my project! Its a low payout for now but a great/fast way to try out lightning
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:24:17
one of the ideas behind ads4satoshis is that the current system of tracking users around the web is terrible for privacy. It would be great if people could opt out of ads and just pay really small amounts of money, ie instead of a 1000 ad impressions giving you $1, people can just pay $0.001 and not view ads/get tracked. The only problem is that onboarding people into bitcoin/lightning is a lot of effort, so you can **choose** to view ads for some sats, hopefully spending those on bitcoin lightning content providers/services.

Thanks! The email list signup is a good idea. This was just a fun little project for me but given the positive feedback, Im gona carry on hacking on it. Im open to having others work on this with me, pm if interested!
Open sourcing is on the roadmap, although I need to clean up the code first! Tbh there isnt any secret sauce, I've got a c-lightning node and Im just making jsonrpc calls over to it. Heres a project that does something similar: [
@_date: 2019-06-04 06:47:11
Thanks! The idea is to make it super easy to get paid out as other attempts always end up with it being impossible to be paid out until you reach a high threshhold. So far 5 people have tried to withdraw, 4 succeeding!
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:58:13
oops, Ive switched to firefox recently, should be fixed now. Thanks for the feedback

Some good videos here: [
Also this is a great resource: [
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:50:23
ahh I forgot to say its using the lightning network, I've found bluewallet the simplest to get started
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:27:55
@_date: 2019-06-04 06:47:29
yep, mvp right there
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:02:16
Yes BAT/Brave is very similar. Although Im not sure you can exchange BAT for anything yet? This was a learning project for me :)
@_date: 2018-11-14 14:29:07
You can use tor and use an onion address. If you run tor service, it will update when your IP changes
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:08:02
What about encrypting the seed?
You build an unsigned transaction, you put that on a USB. You have a raspberry pi in Faraday cage, you plug in usb, unencrypted seed, sign transaction and put signed transaction on usb. You destroy the pi �� and broadcast transaction

Haha I scroll down and this comes up
