lol...no, but I feel trusting a centralized authority like a bank or government is falling out of fashion. Why would ANYONE ever pay taxes, or speeding tickets again? It did not fix your roads, schools or hospitals. It's all going to some fat cats offshore account anyway. Wait for the Panama Papers news updates in the following days. Anyone Pro-government is out to lunch and being taken for a ride. Criminals...all of them. We all fell for it. Just wait for a few more days...

But...you said it was FAR away from ideal. That implies there is MUCH to do. You are looking for ideal money you said. There is more wrong than just the block size debate, or discussion (not a debate anymore).

Well, it seems this GLARING, bright beacon of hope, transparency and promise...seems to be just too good to be true for many folks I speak with about it (I have been holding for 4 years). I have gotten my short elevator pitch down pretty good, and the mid length, educational version is good also. When I usually start the chat most are TOTALLY into it, and love it....then, it just seems to good to be true...aww it will never catch on....I will wait for the banks and governments to decide before I get it, mentality.
Maybe the folks I am chatting with are just way too conservative, or scared, or dumb? Maybe it's a Canadian thing, let everyone else decide if it's good before we get involved? We rarely commit before someone says we can.
My biggest problem with bitcoin? It seems too good to be true...and most do not trust things that are too good to be true. Unfortunately for them....this one seems to be for real, and yes, it's too good to be true, but it's true...don;t get left behind....dummies! LONG HODL!
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:02:07
92% of all Bitcoin is NOT being traded. BTC could go to $1 and no one that has had BTC for a few years would care...because we STILL have our Bitcoin. The price is the LEAST exciting part of Bitcoin. Price is set by someone that wants money...Bitcoin was created to allow people to transfer value, that's not always money. Its a language as  suggests.... it cannot be destroyed no matter how hard they try or how much they spend, it will be futile.

Hmm...so, its printed...but anyone, can print anything, anytime, and it may not be true. Just noise, and perhaps no other evidence to suggest it may happen. I have been hearing about the Bank of China to collapse for 6 years now, or Deutsche Bank was supposed to get wiped out a few times....and now the American Debt ceiling is OVER, 20 Trillion. What does that even mean (nothing really). The current global fragility is so pathetic, Im shocked anyone still uses it, so I would not be surprised re: this article...its just, all I hear is "blah, blah, blah...". Bail outs, print more, who cares about anything that has a number on it, etc.
The monetary system of the world is ALREADY over....now we just have to allow everyone to come to their own understanding of that fact. It's so broken so blatantly obvious. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:35:46
Will they be Segwit enabled...thus WAY, smaller transfer fees, thus it's almost cost effective to charge, as they say "zero fees"? Of course their will always be SOME, fees....but maybe they are willing to eat it, and perhaps increase their spread by a very small amount?

Anyone with internet connection (or Blockstream satellites soon), will have access to BTC. in a few years that will be almost 5 Billion. The market share that can now to banking like the west is about to open up...its not for the west, we already have pretty good (slow/expensive/centrally controlled/censored), banking.
One more bank has to collapse....just one more. It has never, NT happened....always does. Just wait and you will see. Imagine a Euro or US or Asian large bank goes down....what do you think will happen? War?? BTC will skyrocket...black swan events...just wait, it has ALWAYS happened.

The capital requirments are not as high as 10%, no one believs they have it. I heard someone on Bloomberg speculate many have less than 3%.
You can take the risk if your comfortable with that...many have decided to take control of their wealth, and not have to depend on others making false claims (or true...you will never know), about how much cash they have. Ask the Greeks and Venezualeans, or Germans, etc.

I can GUARANTEE, its not 25%. I LITERALLY have given BTC to hundreds of people I know...most are elderly (which is hilarious), none have a handgun (Canada), and there is not a lot of meth in this crowd. 
Lets spin the question then, of all criminal activity, how many use cash or wires etc.? ~98%? Thats the problem: Paradise/Panama papers....thats all the proof anyone needs. All the money to save the world sits offshore by our leaders and noble business leaders. They WILL turn to BTC to protect their wealth someday, but not today.
LOL...25%...what a lark. Thats 1/4....what ever. Now Im going to read the article. EVERY single person I know, holds, minus maybe 10%. They want to buy food, or pay rent...not cocaine. As taxes are imposed on the middle class, more will turn to crypto. 
Let them do illegal stuff...our rich leaders have shown everyone how to do it. Dont declare ANYTHING, EVER, hide it in your Swiss bank account in your pocket, and let the tax man come to you. When they say you owe taxes...just ask them how much? They will not be able to prove anything...then you negotiate like every offshore account does.
Is it true, 46% of every taxed dollar in America does to the Military Industrial complex? Stop paying that as soon as you can.
The criminal activity here is that the law only applies to those that can not afford a gaggle of lawyers, accountants, and banks. Those that can, get to walk away, with profits. The citizenry is turning the tables....forced by feeble, short-sighted policymakers. They made us do it.
Yes. The 111th Congress, which took office in 2009, was the oldest in U.S. history, with an average age of 57 in the House and 63 in the Senate. 
It's about to get funky. I do not want to sound like I am taking the piss out of anyone (I know you did not write this), but I read these articles every few days, written by another middle-aged white guy that seems to know best because they had been around in the "crash of 83" or the dot-com, or the...what ever. Clueless and irrelevant. When EVERYONE knows this, they start to fend for themselves, not relying on the system, because its not there for them when they need it.
I have several companies in crypto, paying all my taxes and declaring everything constantly, but they still have no idea what I am doing. Its so crazy....especially when they leave sick for a few days...uugghh

The 7 network effects of Bitcoin are as follows:
**Speculation** - As a novel, cryptographically-backed asset class with the potential for appreciation and high volatility, Bitcoin is perfect for speculators with a high tolerance for risk.
**Merchant Adoption** - Merchants will increasingly accept Bitcoin because they can increase their profit margins by avoiding credit card fees and chargebacks.
**Consumer Adoption** - Consumers can use Bitcoin to save money at certain vendors. For example, getting a 20% discount on Amazon by spending Bitcoin through Purse. Additionally, consumers can buy things with Bitcoin that they cannot buy (easily) in any other way. Consider: An American can buy Persian rugs or Cuban cigars online despite trade embargoes. Bitcoin increases the efficiency of the economy, particularly in niche areas such as these.
**Security** - Merchant, consumer, and speculator adoption lead to a higher price and thus incentivize more miners to participate and secure the system. The decentralized, immutable transaction ledger also serves as a form of Triple Entry Bookkeeping, wherein Debits plus Credits plus the Network Confirmations of transactions increase trust and accountability across the system.
**Developer Mindshare** - Bitcoin is a dumb and predictable network with simple rules and a publicly-auditable codebase. It is fertile ground for the development of complicated algorithms, machine-to-machine payment protocols, smart contracts, and other tools. Its decentralized nature allows for innovation without permission. Altcoins (such as Litecoin and Ethereum) pose little threat as Bitcoin is already dominant as a store of value and as a medium of exchange in the cryptocurrency space. If you harbor doubts about the importance of this currency network effect — or worry about altcoins overtaking Bitcoin in some other way; I would point you to Daniel Krawisz with an insightful and though-provoking article on the subject: The Coming Demise of Altcoins. Ultimately, developers will continue to flock to Bitcoin.
**Financialization** - Bitcoin will eat up progressively more of the market share of legacy banking institutions in areas such as remittances, micropayments, peer-to-peer lending, and the exchange of stocks and securities. This process has already begun (consider NASDAQ's support of Open Assets/Colored Coins for the transfer of securities, NYSE's investment in Coinbase, etc.). Old money risks dying out lest it embrace new protocols such as Bitcoin.
**Adoption as a World Reserve Currency** - Eventually all transactions will be settled on the blockchain, including house titles, stock purchases, car titles, and other monetary instruments and currencies. Network effects one through six culminate in this final network effect. Any newcomer in the realm of cryptocurrency or traditional currency, for that matter; would need to beat Bitcoin in all seven of these areas. This is unlikely considering the pace of development in Bitcoin Core, the level of investment in Bitcoin companies around the world, the growth in Bitcoin's user base, and on and on; Further price increases will only accelerate the process. Finally, a speculative attack could dramatically boost the value of Bitcoin almost overnight.

Honestly, its a bunch of people fixated on what others think the price is...finance people making claims its work "X". Rarely I hear ANY person that makes a market prediction, consider or present the valuation from a technology standpoint...what does it do? Is it getting better or worse etc.
The tech is advancing at crazy speed...it really does stuff...it has never been compromised....more than a million accounts a day are being registered still....it can scale.
In the new future, we will look back a laugh that this is even a concern. Dollars are nothing more than a metric of appreciation. Most do not appreciate BTC for what it is, what it does, how well it works, and what the market size is potentially. 
I think it could EASILY moon any day....or just fumble around for 8 months. The Tech news is FANTASTIC....the finance news is, meh. 
It will not disappear, how long are you willing to wait? The upside potential is massive, I think its worth the risk. HODL!

All very valid and well thought out. I personally think we will see another 2009 collapse easily...no one will be keeping money in banks after that. They can create fake financials all they want (its already going on all the time), they will just be trading amongst them selves monopoly money. The people will not allow another rape of their accounts...it may happen, but they will not allow it, so it will be stolen. Lets see how that goes.

1.) "Forgot your password?"
I have had several cheques (maybe 30-40) held back from many days to weeks. Wikileaks and many others have had bank accounts seized...they remembered their passwords....or wrote them down.
2. Banks are there for a reason
Manual overrides...thats called manipulation. You ever heard of a bail out...I will suggest you read about 2008-2009. Never again.
3. Transparency is not something we desire in reality
For some it maybe, who are you to decide, my choice not yours and never will be.
4. Cause of climate change
when you send $100 from bank to landlords (anyone's bank) bank, there are many thousands of employees that go to work every day, in cars, to a concrete building, that uses aircon and heaters, etc.....to build the infrastructure of a bank, to be called a bank costs BILLIONS, takes decades and has a carbon footprint that decimates the tiny footprint of BTC. Get your facts straight.
5. Current use: criminal activity &amp; tax evasion
I use BTC everyday or 2...so do most of the people I fly around the world to work with. The only criminals I know use fiat for their drugs...and wars. I declare my tax... You are not even close.
It expensive to use....so don't. It will be cheaper later...then use it. It's not rocket science. This is literally a vote of confidence against financial institutions. BTC would not be a thing, if they were fair, cheaper, available when customers wanted them, faster, and did not fuck them. Banks did it to themselves, game over....or they can get better....which they will not...and more will leave them.

nope. If one country bans it, all economic benefit of being in the game is lost to another country that will HAPPILY take the potential income. Every country in the world would have to agree to ban it...and that has never worked before in history.

First of all, what you just said is not true regarding all ming farms and exchanges being shut down. Second, IF it was the case that they did....ask yourself, "did they succeed in stopping bitcoin?".
No....they did not succeed in stopping bitcoin use, adoption, demand or transfer. In fact, all of these numbers are increasing, which you can find the metrics represented by country, if you do the proper search.
If the almighty "America" decides to deem bitcoin illegal....and it continues to grow in adoption, demand and use....well, then it just proves what most people already believe. Individual sovereign states that decry what you can and cannot do....should be ignored as they are feckless, weak, and insignificant. 
That's the REAL fear in America...if they say one thing, and the people say "who cares", then they are irrelevant in the eyes of the people. Governments are only in power because people fear them....not because of respect. The Government should be fearful of its people...not the other way around.
Bitcoin has become a direct reference of respect and relevancy of a governing power...if it continues to prove, to be disappearing (the price of bitcoin continues to grow, after they say you are not allowed to use it), then you must question centralized decision making and issuance of currency by decree. 
The paradigm shift that bitcoin offers is the most significant invention the world has ever created. True sovereignty is now possible for the first time in history. Right now, everyone can participate...no matter what the US Gov says or does....they cannot stop it, they can't even agree on immigrant crossings, gun rights, taxation, telecos, etc. it goes on. Imagine them trying to convince another 190 countries to ban bitcoin....lol!
They can't even tie their shoelaces the same way.

Even if it goes to a penny....it still works and cannot be stopped, thus those that have an independent mind CAN (no one has to, it's volentary, not issued by decree...that's why it's superior in everyway), use it if they choose.
If you like to be controlled by others, use government money. If you like to use your own mind, you may use Bitcoin...or another crypto. No pressure. Fiat, is pressure by decree...by force.

Not at all. Its more true than anything you have seen before regarding taking personal responsibility of your own wealth.

I like analyzing the symptom of the fear...they know they will be out of a job soon if they don't try and stop it now. I wonder if they will require citizens to declare it, once they realize that they can not stop it. Even then, who cares. As a few million are told to stop using it, 10's of MORE millions are racing into the market. The price will continue to rise and the citizens will be upset that they could not do it....then do it anyway. 
Once that begins, it will be evident that governments are irrelevant, expensive and antiquated. The first few countries that declare that they ARE buying, will save their country from crushing financial realities....because every other citizen of the world ARE still buying it...and banks, and governments, etc.
Its a self-fulling prophecy. If Bankers and Politicians did not keep ending up in the news and financial scandal papers and had a good product and where competitively priced...and where not able to seize our money (Im looking at you Cypress/Greece/et.), well then they would be fine...but they are not.

This is WAY bigger than Wall st., and if that sounds strange to you, you really should learn more about Bitcoin. America has never ever had to deal with something like this before. The slogan came from Wall street, but it took place in more cities around the world than any protest in global history...did you know that? More than any war ever produced, it was not all about Wall St.

These guys are paid by taxpayers, that already do not trust them or respect them....now they are proving that point even further. Press, politicians, bankers, and economists...irrelevant. As the price goes up, and the public sees that they again have lied, the speed will increase and the demise of the system will be evident. They did it to themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:09:07
My point was, lets see how many get caught...or decide to declare. It will be a small number (most old timers are never going to get caught, and are willing to risk it). Its not taxable if its not used or sold....in America, so i will spend it in another country, cash always goes to where it is treated best, ask the offshore tax haven business. 
The NEW crypto declaration in the American tax code will be futile, ESPECIALLY if its overreach. If they ask an American to "declare", all their crypto trading from last year, and the year before...do they want you to declare from 6 years ago etc? How far back will they reach? Terrifying implications really...so, I foresee most (not all), will learn how to hide, move, etc their crypto and trades and purchases to favourable jurisdictions...like tax havens do today for the uber-rich (because they can afford lawyers and accountants etc.).
If the people are able to circumvent the government, it means lack of respect, that my friend is a VERY slippery slope which has repeated itself many times over history, and NOT to the establishment's benefit.
Thats the fuck what im talking about. Hodl, it will be worth it if you can see the tree from the forest. Its a self-fulfilling prophecy...if you have been paying attention to the nuanced genius that is being worked on at a fever pitch...for free...all over the world. The sovereign states do not have the resources, nor the support (or the smarts) of the people. Sometimes head get cut off for far less. 
This may sound altruistic, perhaps it is but it literally is happening. Many smart companies left NY because of the NY License, and they walked across the bridge into NJ, because it was favorable...and I know through experience, that MANY are just leaving America. The brain drain is very significant, this talent will change the world...will it be done in America, its up to the people.

Russia / China and few others have tried to ban it, and it went to an all time high. Just imagine if America did that? That would mean that no one cares what America says and their credibility (what little is left) will disappear. If no one is afraid of you, then NO one will respect your laws. Its a HUGE political risk, especially if they get it wrong. A large part of this debate seems to revolve around "America". You know people in other countries have money right? Americans are so narrow viewed in this discussion...its literally a gloable currencey. If America bans it, it will be Americas loss, as every other country will be buying it....and IF (just a hypothetical), it goes to 1 million....Americans will be burnt...again. 
The WHOLE market cap of BTC is less than $300 Billion USD (Approx). every day between 3-5 Billion is traded a day ...they can not buy BILLIONS...it would drive the market through the roof, and take months/years.

@_date: 2017-12-09 00:44:46
In a Ponzi, you borrow from a new investor, to pay off the last, there is always someone wanting their money back...so you have to keep the charade going.
Bitcoin has been paid in full up front, with no debt owing. A a scarcity of a settlement tool (trust machine) that can be owned, and proven to be owned. There is no debt attached (until the futures begin).
There is NO ONE, chasing me down for the Bitcoin I have paid for saying, "Hey, you still owe me a bunch of money, because you took my Bitcoin last week". That is a Ponzi.
A bubble, is also when someone borrows money to buy an asset they can not afford...then that asset goes down, but you can not get the same amount out fo the asset because its worth less than when you bought it. Bitcoin is paid, in cash, up front, in full, no debt attached. 
It's not meant for speculation (I know it is now), its a trust mechanism, that is limited in amount...that can do things that have never been able to be done before, its a utility, and the technology is worth a lot to some people. Some just like that its going up in a metric that we understand called "cash/money/dollars", because if you do not understand the technology (which is paramount to understanding what its "worth"), the quantifier is its worth "this many dollars". Its much more than just worth "this many dollars"...it brings trust to trustless society, its global, it's programmable, and it has not been compromised. 
Triple entry bookkeeping for the anyone in the world to have a more trusted bank system than the world has ever seen, in your pocket...it ain't no Ponzi...its evolution and it's unstoppable. Once you understand all the tech stuff pretty well, you will see a MUCH bigger importance than "$40,000 or more USD per BTC". It's not about the cost of a Bitcoin, it's about, what is the value, what does it really do and what will it change. 
Often people use these terms only because its all they understand, how they quantify. There is a new group appreciating things that are less interested in the price but the function. How much is the internet worth to you or the other guy to own 1 of 21 million pieces of it...but it worked way better and had all the features of BTC? More than 20 G? 
Good discussion....everyone keep thinking, and in my case, HODL!

So Bitcoin always ANYONE, ANYWHERE in the world, to control, handle, transfer, share...THEIR OWN MONEY! The dicks on Wall st. have no idea whats goin on...all they see is potential profits...FOMO. 
I will ask you this, when did they start buying Bitcoin? A few months ago? Last year? All I hear from wealthy folks is its for drugs and porn and "that dark web thing". Thanks to the GREED of the current rich FOMO, the less wealthy (from all over the world), started to acquire more wealth.

Its not available. They would have to come ask people that are holding, like me to sell it to them. 
I know for fact, there is A country trying to buy $900 Million worth, a sovereign nation. The team that will "buy" for them (brokers, OTC, etc.), are saying that it could take MANY month or even a year to buy that much....while there are other groups competing to do the same. The liquidity does not exist for sale.
It will make the price sky rocket (which is what is happening).

This commerce, offered to the whole world for the first time in history, and you don't have to TRY and open a bank account in a lesser privilege place. The numbers are staggering, and there is a lot of phones out there. This will be honest capitalism, with real checks and balances and terms built into it. I fear the Fractional-reserve banking issues may come home to roost, at some point, as we enter a currency struggle/war. This is a truth mechanism, for commerce/capitalism/wealth transfer, and more.

Well, it won't cost me much...on the contrary, most in here SHOULD benefit. There are large defaults on the near horizon of considerable sized companies before the fed hike, this will just expedite that process I believe.

The idea is...no tax dollars for the military industrial complex, and the losers that run the current joke of Democracy. 43 cents on every U.S. Dollar goes directly to weapons/war....not their people. If you take that away (Bitcoin), the middle aged man that is addicted to power will run out of steam. Tax is theft....I invite anyone to show me how their "Sovereign" Governments spend their taxes. Huge inefficiencies will drive citizens to the protection of their OWN wealth, thus strangling useless politicians from taking your money for insane and completely stupid reasons. This maybe the last chance for the status quo (current, pathetic, narcissistic, self enriching, etc. ) and the current leaders to steal as much as they can. We are literally in a revolution.

Exactly the idea my good man! Id like to see that in a list with your review and allow people to up tick or down tick , upon their agreement or peer review of your comment. It will then allow the public to have access to a verification system determined by others like them.

@_date: 2018-05-21 01:27:48
I think \(im not a lawyer, so please verify for your self...just my understanding\), he exchanged cash for crypto, without verifying that the money was "clean". If you sell BTC in the US, you maybe considered a Money Service Business \(MSB\), thus requiring licenses, incorporation, etc.
It was seen as a business...if it was only a little here and there it may have worked out better, still risky in some states as you can see what authorities may want to do if they are concerned. AML and KYC will be enforced as we have now seen.
Speaking with several large exchanges at Consensus this year about these kind of concerns with the relationships they are building...every one said they are trying to stay out of America all together. Its to legally unattractive for small margins.
The **sovereign** state is scared of Bitcoin, and lack of income that it will lead to if it continues to thrive. Here is a tip for these people, it will continue, change your policey to encourage this great technology. If you do not, you will lose, and you will be on the wrong side of history.

Quadriga is great, and there are no limits. Just go theough the KYC (use Canada Post to verify). Do not freak out regarding the time it takes to wire Fiat in and out...that's the banks fault, not Quadriga. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:39:22
...or ATM's is best. If the banks do not want to do business with you, just go around them \(if you live in a bigger city\), and use ATM's. Cash only, but you will not be held hostage by financial institutions like banks.
Another GREAT reason, and I am not a financial advisor so please do your own research...I think, if you use cash only, no one has a record of your new asset \(Bitcoin\), so CRA will never know what you hold. If you do it through your bank account the tax man, and bank, and anyone else will have access to YOU, buying Bitcoin and may choose to ask you about it at a later date. This is a big decision to consider as you build your crypto position and tax planning.
I know people that have many Bitcoin that they bought from ATM's and from people at Meetups that will never declare it or discuss it. This will literally blow up any centralized business \(banks\) or Government in the long run, as they depend upon YOUR money to survive. Most of the people I talk to have very little respect for the poor job that these people do. 
If the banks make it difficult for you to spend YOUR money....make it difficult for them to make a profit from YOUR money. Peer to peer, ATM's is the best way even if you pay 2 or 3 percent more. In the long run, your have financial sovereignty and no one can take that away from you.
Im just saying.

Not if banks have to write down their assets, because a huge amount of defaults are occurring. If no one pays back the loans, the banks will repossess the assets, which could strengthen the Yuan, but freak the heck out of everyone else that holds cash, or is able to get their hands on to cash. Capital flight will accelerate, even if the Yuan gets stronger by that chain of events....but confidence in the government and the finance sector will collapse. The house prices will start to fall (as interest rises), and people will start unloading any over valued homes for a discount....house of cards. It's all very fragile right now, not just in China, and they are all intertwined.

WOW....is that what a Prof can say once he in tenured? Does he get paid? Better start doing some homework Sir. The purchase power (value) has destroyed the USD over a 6 yr history. Thats a lot of drug dealers and speculators...or maybe people value it more over the long run compared to fiat?
Confidence and scarcity is the underlying symptom of value. If someone WISHES to trade you dirt rather than USD, then whats worth more, even its for a short time? There is a massive adoption rate to BTC, because confidence is slipping in the global, debt based fiat Central bank practise (a band aid here or there). If you have a trillion bucks, then print a Trillion more...but the same amount of "things" in the world....you still only have a Trillion dollars, being pushed up by more spending power...not scarcity. 
How much gold is there is there in the world? No one knows, but I know how many bitcoin there is....and I have NO confidence in the accounting or auditing of a corrupt, monopolised, greedy, power, hungry, global finance system that is destined to fail....by sheer logic, facts and numbers.
Scarcity in bitcoin in real...there are only a few. Dollars? Its a never ending supply...that scares me. The global banking system is on its knees, about to have a heart attack, its inevitable. 
What will you be holding when its all over? Bitcoin, priceless. HODL!

We may get a bump or 2 in the road (everyone relax, we know what you want to say...WE know, chill), but the bigger of adoption is rolling out very well. Fixes are being found, and being work out very fast....solutions are happening all around this space.
Every screen in the world can very soon participate...oh, and negative interest rates on deposits are set to climb. It's coming! 
Robert Duval in the movie Colors said to his younger police partner, "Relax, don't just RUN down that hill and fuck one of them cows.....walk down there and fuck them all!" (when the time is right).

But....its "the people" they are trying to curtail. Some like your self will have a great buying opportunity, and do well off of it, but those that get spooked (the people) are the ones they are trying to stop from capital flight. They will have a hard time keeping up with mortage payments that will be going up. As you state, it may do some great stuff for the country and its currency, I just find it an interesting coincidence that the rates are going up a day after the PBOC is telling BTC exchanges to not allow any bitcoin withdrawals for a month. It leads me to think (and of course I may be very wrong), that first, you try to control the outflow of capital, then you raise interest rates...to strengthen the Yuan. It seems a little coordinated. I may be totally wrong of course.

For the fist time in global history, anyone with access to the internet and electricity can participate in an ACTUAL free market society without the permission, or interruption, or manipulation. This is honestly the most even playing field the world has ever seen. Sure, some have the majority of the trading chips (BTC), but if you are a true entrepreneur in a 3rd world country, and you are smart and able to create business, you have an actual unfettered chance of success...without government or business license or fancy people interfering. This is unique and very important. In today's papers, 63 people, own more wealth than 50% of the world population. This is because they have special relationships with banks, governments and armies. If you or I are REALLY bright, and we become that rich in bitcoin, as of today it would be because we actually deserve it...not because of corruption and our alliance with a powerful force. Did that make a little sense?
The new wealthy, as of today in crypto world will be rich because they succeeded with skill and smarts, not because they are tricky and evil.
Free market capital. for the first time in global history...truly and honestly. The unbanked, or underbanked (68% of the world) will have the same access to commerce and tools that you and I have in rich countries (trading tools, instruments, investments tools, etc.). This is a truly a leveling of the playing field.

I agree, this is JUST the start! It sounds like so many foolish, short-sighted people TRYING to disrupt the progress. I honestly thin that they are PAID shills from the finance world trying to scare people away from bitcoin. Well...they are really looking foolish. Bitcoin has never been stronger, or advancing quicker. The writing is on the wall....this is going to the moon, whether you like it or not. Things are looking the best they ever have!
2mb will come. Relax everyone, it will come. If you don't like the speed of progress towards 2 mb, then fork off. Thats how it works, you know the rules.

Why would they restrict them selves? It does both....REALLY well. Try not to be so narrow in your dreams, if you can be both....and more, why not take advantage of it? Everyone already (the holders) in bitcoin knows its both settlement and currency and programmable technology and more. I am a holder (HODL), and an everyday user with decent volume used. Transations everyday....value holding everyday....program it everyday....and some other things also.

Not if you can't afford the rate raise, and you default. Most of these "zombie" cities have apartments with greedy people that are FAR over extended in debt...they just found some money lenders that would give them cheap loans. So they got 2 or 3...but can barely make the payment. Raise the rates little bit....and you if you can't sell it....things can go tits up really fast. It almost brought down the global finance industry in 2008, as we are still remembering (and feeling the effects of).

When you have a monopoly on something....you do not let your monopoly get destroyed, even if it's inferior. They are VERY greedy, and super fearful, all powerful (until they are not) and dickheads. In the end they will capitulate and adopt or die. The current global monetary-financial model is on borrowed time, it is destined to die, built on a debt based system that can create infinite liquidity. Fear and greed will drive a cartel to crazy limits to destroy others and protect what ever funds them. The writing is on the wall...the curtain will fall.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:09:43

This is the largest financial exchange tool in the world that has been robbed of trillions of dollars. The fiat system honestly, is rigged for only a few to benefit. These guys even admitted they manipulated for gains! The current system only works for a few. Bitcoin is really our only hope to disrupt the current fraudulent judicial and financial model! Let's not mess up this wonderful opportunity. If the laws of the land do will not provide justice, then we must create justice.

This is the new "intellectual capital" struggle for sovereign nations. Just like being an offshore tax haven for the last generation, it will be a race to to attract the new smart money. Any country that over taxes this new asset, will be left in the cold, and I (many of us) will pack up our laptop, ipod, and socks, and move. Smart countries must now compete for the new economy...because the old one is dying. 
For decades, countries competed to be the most attractive tax haven, offer the best deals to bring in the commerce. Now, its regarding a new monetary paradigm.
Why in the world would I stay in America if they tax me 35%, and Canada taxes me 15%....or Mexico 5% etc. If I have lots of crypto currency, you had better be good to me, or I won't stay.
The goal lines are shifting. Make sure your local politicians (still a little old school tied to the new), understands the importance of "brain drain", or capital flight in their soon to be new economy. 
I forget who said it recently in a tweet, "once a currency does not respect a sovereign nation, neither will its people". Be mobile, make the policy makers WORK for you. The ball is in our court for a change...use it to your advantage for something better. Countries will start competing, maybe starting with Japan?

By no means have you missed the boat my good man, I am mining 2 crypto now, and turning a great profit. My energy is fairly cheap in Vancouver Canada, so I pay$250 CDN for my juice, and return about $600 in return. I trade my crypto  on Poloionex, and take the BTC. Then, as BTC is growing, I held my BTC from last month, and its now worth $700, and maybe worth more if I hold for another month....you see?
I do GPU mining, so I cant do Bitcoin mining, but I can do most of the others. If that does not work out for me in the near future, I can use the GPU cards for computational power, and rent it out. If that does not make a profit for me, thenI can sell the hardware that may have depreciated a little bit...maybe 20% per year approx, then I can maybe get half of my initial investment if I sell the cards on Craigslist or something like that...I have done it before, no problem.
I think mining for Bitcoin directly, maybe a little hard to start up now...but any progressive looking business that are wanting to offer a good service is starting to allow you to work smoothly within any business model. 
The trick to appreciate a small trickle of this stuff, treat it as a passive income. I have a very incomplete site that I am trying to get started that will help others like you look at our simple roadmap of a small "Drip" of income. Get a few working at the same time, the moon will become clearer. (&lt;-being silly).   dripbit.org

This is VERY true....buy some (I would buy as much as I could personally), and dont look at it for 3 years. You May never have to work again in your life. Or, if it tanks....you may have to work, just as you thought you would a month ago. Bitcoin IS, going to succeed, those that understand and take a small risk will be rewarded. Before you do anyting, read as much Global news as you can as fast as possible, and then ask yourself, "are things getting better, or worse?"
The "Black Swan" is about to rise up...and I do not want to be holding Government issued paper money when it does.
Do some research, really ask yourself geo political and geo financial questions about the future, be really honest with your self about your answers. Then realize that only those that take SOME risk will be rewarded. 
Very soon there will be those with BTC and those looking for BTC. In this reply to the original poster...I am trying to save you some time as I have done the research for 6 years. I am not a coder but an analyst, and the people that I speak with are buying as much as they can now. 
I will apologize to you in advance IF you lose all your money because you invested in Bitcoin (I will be out also), but thats the risk I am willing to take to never have to work again and apply all my efferts into helping others and actually solving the worlds issues...because the guys in charge right now, are doing a very poor jobs and will be removed one way or another.
This will be the largest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen....ist coming. HODL! The moon will become clearer for the many soon....

The moon is coming.
March 15 the US debt ceiling will max out (20 Trillion) and they must ask for another 5-10 Trillion dollar limit. This will create a government shutdown and ever more financial uncertainty and fear. There is a stampede of chaos coming over the hill, I am getting ready.

@_date: 2017-03-26 19:22:18
I participated, and received a "colored coin", which was sent to my Colu wallet with ease. Because I invested in an earlier round, I got an additional .1 of a share, or 10% (1.1 MyCellium asset...or shares).
It is a NON voting share (which is a little frustrating), which is fine as I just wanted to help out the company in its expansion ideas...with a small hope that IF there is a distribution of dividends, I MAY receive a little here and there. If not, I can perhaps trade it, or sell it to someone that sees value in this company...that does not disburse or distribute value to its shareholders (so may not be worth much).
It was a pretty easy, seamless raise of funds...impressive to see the process and understand that ANYONE or company can attract investors without oversight...so it MAYBE riskier if you do not do you due diligence. This is just common sense of course, but I am very confident in the MyCellium group, they have impressed me with their products in the past, and I am in no rush for any sort of return. I will HODL, like most of my other crypto, or shares.
This is a patience game. I like going long.

Not the same amount, but the equivalent to their dollar rate. So, I stock up un BTC now, and its easier for me to pay them later in a depreciating currency. Its a wise move for any company or group that wants to hire in the future.

@_date: 2016-01-10 19:10:55
Well, they cant do anything really. You can see that in China as a great example...its illegal on the books, yet its most of the volume? Like POT in Canada, its illegal in the federal laws, yet you cant stop it.
As banks and Governments attempt to "round up" and control those BTC involved, you will find more people WILL circumvent the rules and it will have the opposite affect the governing bodies had hoped for. Its a lose, lose from this point forward for those that will try and control or overreach with legislations as was the case in NY state. Last week, NY is NOW changing/altering the rules of the bitlicense to TRY and attract/entice that talent back (you see what happened there...they scared them away, then said "uh oh", lets get them back cause they are smart folks). 
Establishments are no longer in the drivers seat, think about that.
Within a month of the "Bitlicense" being SUGGESTED in NY(not even implemented yet), 82 % of the "innovative human capital" (business licenses working in crypto currencies) working, funding and hiring in the state of NY wrapped up and left the state to somewhere more favourable. Its a cat and mouse game...imagine that on a national level? Thats a great way to convince anyone doing anything innovative, creating jobs and income (which could be taxed, if its fair in the future, its a careful negotiation) to just leave. 
The public really understands whats going on with the basic mistrust of governance in finance, and central authority is not looking out for their best interests. A great way to bring down a SUPER frail, rickety, broken, greedy, inept, self serving, egomaniacal, pompous, antiquated system....is introduce MORE of the same rules/firm handed legislation that the "people" do not want. Its a sure fire method to collapse the existing confines of control...fast.
Its already over for the establishment...they just do not know it yet, and it cant be stopped.

Banks are dead...at least in Canada. The MOST democratic and antiquated models ever, and they don't care. As long as they can keep milking retired grannies for $5 here and there....and a little offshore hiding of funds for rich folks and companies, they do not care about the people.

This is a crime...happening again (or still). Hold your BTC, this game is coming to an end soon. There are two sets of rules in the world...one for those with money, and one for the rest of us. Why in the world would anyone ever participate if they understood they dont have to? If individuals do not particpate (what ever their comfort level allows), I'm afraid they will be very sorry in a few years. You are watching nothing more than a Cartel/mafia in suits in the legacey banking system. Time to wrap up that ongoing scandle. If you every thought there was something of important to learn in life...I ecnourage everyone that is just hearing about Bitcoin, to spend 3 or 5 days learning as much as they can. Why work....when you can retire. Most will learn and understand more about Bitoin in a few days of good research, than anyone can leanr after a lifetime of tryiing to understand how the banking system works....because it seems to change with every meeting, or bail out, or new government...nothing more than a moving garbage heap that morphs into another form of stealing from the people. Banking is not made for you and I to benefit, its served its purpose for a long time, the new form of holding value is now upon us. Spread the word, patiently and carefully. Your friends will thank you later.

I can walk around anywhere with the value of any house in my pocket, and its appreciating (minus the last 10 months....look at 12 months or 24 months for example). Throw in ALL the other benefits of BTC, and yes of course this will "replace "part of the value of real estate which is a Store of Value", it already has. If you own a house, its REALLY easier to seize, or place a lean on it (ie: for outstanding disputes, owed taxes, ownership arguments, etc.).
As we witness ANOTHER real estate crash (did we not just have sub prime 11 yrs ago?), of course anyone that knows how to use Bitcoin...will.
This is just beginning.

Why doesn't China attack Bitcoin? Because they are making money from Bitcoin. You don't bite the hand that feeds you...
If the Chinese JUST wanted profit from "attacking" Bitcoin, there is FAR more money available in the fiat currency than Bitcoin.
If I wanted to make money, do I attack a 14 Billion dollar business that I use to funnel my money out of China, OR do I "attack" a VERY weak, multi-Trillion dollar banking business that has nearly no security? Which one would give you a better return? You say the Chinese are calculated then there is your answer.

Stupid tortoise. 
Unfortunately, this is how Darwinism works. Just as unfortunately, in this world of utter greed, entitlement, and self-serving, narcissism...it seems most other tortie have no interest helping their own kind. For the first time in world history, 7 billion plus tortie are greedier than ever and are racing for their own accumulation of junk. This will be the downfall of all Tortoises. It is a primitive and foolish focus on the individual, self-serving. I hope most will clearly see the need to help others, and be willing to share knowledge as we gain in the ability to solve most of the worlds corrupt systems with the ability to accept that all we need is...just enough to enjoy. Can you REALLY drive 5 Ferraris at once, and watch 6 Televisions, etc? You can be part of the problem or the solution. Think wisely. We have the chance to change the world...lets just make it for the better. Poor little Tortoise...maybe we will grow up and someone will flip you over.
This is our time Tortie! Make it count.

They do....about as aggressively as watching molasses pour. The market has proven MUCH swifter than enforcement my friend. Im not suggesting you evade in any way, anything. But as you know tax "planning" to minimize taxes is totally fine. Until this gets regulated (take ages, but they are getting there), many will choose to be voluntary or not as usual. Once folks (around the world), understand there is someone/agencies that want what little they have, they sometimes become informed with what those people want their money for...and the powers that do this "collecting" are losing trust. This is all about trust, but you know that. Capital of large size is being absconded...not by the poor, but by the wealthy are a much larger scale. Now, all you have to do is learn about some tools, and you are more immune (thanks Panama Papers) than the more expensive (traditional bank/offshore/lawyer/accountants etc.) method. Its just a matter of time now. Like the discussion regarding encryption. Banning it is Futile, you cant enforce someone NOT to think "one plus one is NOT two". It is, thus its fact...so is encryption...so is using readily available tools, to circumvent laws that cant keep up.

Will there be any Consequences for the manipulators? If history has proven to us....no there will not be. This is why Bitcoin was invented, to NOT work with the rats and scum of the financial world. Their industry is all ready over (and they know it), so they will try their best to grab as much wealth as they can possibly steal.
To participate in the rat race...you have to be a rat. Send these clowns to jail. The Governments of the world want to TRY and control this new industry so bad...well, here is your first REAL test to see if the Governments/officials can do anything responsible....take them to jail. All the evidence is there.

This is a done deal (in my humble opinion). Just a heads up. HODL!
@_date: 2016-11-17 20:09:56
False statement I'm afraid. It has lost value (never collapsed), and its has always recovered. If my correction were not true, Bitcoin would not be in existence today, nor would it be worth the price that people are paying for it everyday. A collapse is a "cessation of function", as in its over. Recovery is proven in the fact that it will cost me about $740 USD to buy one today...maybe more tomorrow, which will verify even further this correction.
@_date: 2016-11-18 01:32:35
Andreas has always said, Bitcoin is an alternative to fiat, not a replacement. He still gets paid for many other projects, and consulting in Bitcoin and says he has lived on Bitcoin for 3 years. Maybe he is stretching it a little, but as an entrepreneur he could get paid in mud, and still be a strong proponent for BTC. Maybe he accepts another altcoin for shoveling snow...he still took the time to write a book to educate folks about Bitcoin, and I know for a fact he gets paid in Bitcoin for some work.

Just sit back and watch the empire collapse...everyone out side of America knows whats coming, but do the folks INSIDE know? This is childs play, predictable and anticipated. I have more important things to do, to prepare myself and to benefit (gain), from watching this obvious demise. Writing is on the wall, if your an American, do you see it?

Become a "contract worker", and get paid in Bitcoin (there are service that can arrange that for you easily). Then you have to pay your tax at the end of the year, not your employer....but if you do not pay it, the Government/tax man, can not seize it, as its in Bitcoin. Then you get to TELL them, what you want to pay taxes for...or they put you in jail...if they can catch you.
.24 Cents of every dollar taxed in the USA goes to the military...I don't agree with that, and would maybe not pay that one (im not American). Yea, this is going to blow up the tax code, HUGELY!

If I was a business, I would keep all my profit it BTC and pay no tax. Thus the owness of responsibility of declaring my income would become....voluntary!? Can't be forced, seized, controlled or seen. Write off's are only useful if you declare income. No income, no tax, no write offs....full profit, hidden. Scary, yet exciting. I may be wrong...just playing devils advocate. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 00:26:02
When anyone (everyone) can decide what to spend their income on in taxes...because their accounts cant be frozen...anyone hodeling (&lt;-On purpose) can opt out of what they disagree with. A major problem for sovereigns. Its borderline anarchy. If you have a few million $ in fiat today, you can hide your money...the very rich, pay for lawyers and accountants to hide their income. Now with Crypto, anyone can. The Panama Papers proved that rich folks dont like giving up their money. Daunting, but society has shown us that most are not happy with the way tax law is forced upon them. I see a struggle coming.

If you're going to post in the Reddit, think about it and make it good..as it used to be. These days it feels like bots and bankers and b-cashers. It does not matter really as the intelligent thinkers and "real" Bitcoiners are not using this Reddit anymore...they have moved on and are communicating in more secure environments.

It seems the swamp is growing, everywhere. Time to put a stop to this repetitive [insanity]( There is no accountability in today's system, and they do not give a shit about you or me. The status quo is about to get their balls squeezed! No one trusts third parties anymore. Bitcoin is the solution! I hate to offer my opinion, but for me personally, Im glad a drained my bank and bought something that's actually worth something. The current system is going down...hard! Time for plan "B". Things are going to get funky...

These people, are your politicians and banks, that are not interested in "Mitigating" their taxes, but avoidance which is illegal in G20 countries. If they do not pay taxes...I'll bet you are and,  are paying for the things they did not want to....like schools and hospitals. Sooooo...if they are not interested in paying...why should you, is my point?

And it not a bubble. Everyone has paid in FULL (no debt) to buy equity in a finite resource. Houses, cars, Credit, Student loads, etc when you BORROW money and there is a future risk of price fluctations (interst etc), THAT leads to a bubble. Sure, it maybe expensive so are iPhones. Are iPhones in a bubble? Gold? Houses...maybe, because people are borrowing for something they do not have the capital for. BTC, paid in full..no bubble. BTFD and HODL.

When ubiquity is achieved. At a certain point you will be able to frictionlessly, instantly, seamlessly be able to just pay for what you need at that moment. Why have $100 USD in your wallet when you just want a coffee, pack of gum and some beer? As you require these items, your NFC type interaction will shave off $5 bucks here and there when required...otherwise, it will stay in BTC. Cross atomic swaps, which will be available soon thanks to SEGWIT will allow seamless integration. Payment channels will remain open for example, starbucks and Exxon for gas. Ie. I will add $100 to my Starbucks payment channel..but it will be increasing daily, every day they deduct % bucks when I walk in for ajava...the other 95 % will be increasing every day...so its constantly topping up. When I realize Starbucks sucks for coffee, I will close the payment channel (which costs nearly nothing to interact), and withdraw the rest. Perhaps Exxon and Starbucks (whoever you transact with) will have their own token...rather than buy their shit coin, I HODL in BTC and just exchange my $5 of BTC into BUCKSCOIN at that moment and remain in BTC with my balance which is appreciating. Imagine your NFC or Bluetooth as the intermediary tool for exchanging. Maybe your fingerprint will authorize the transaction. You will NEVER want to cash out, because...what will you cash out to? USD,Gold,Eur? Sure, if you like no return you can most likely do so...but it will most likely be less lucrative. BTC will continue to go up and down, but over the long run (like 1 or 2 or 3 years), you will not want to.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:25:50
I think you are correct. But all we have to do is buy BTC. No need to get violent. Its becoming the perfect storm.

Because what this shows is, if your rich you can not pay taxes (and in many cases take your citizen's tax revenue and hide/steal it)....if you're not rich, you still have to pay taxes. Bitcoin is the 99.999% best chance to play like the Queen and the last 4 Prime Ministers of Canada have done...plus another several thousand tax dodgers.

Yes it can...and if the development is allowed to continue, it will. There are several solutions that will allow this to happen that are being created. The transaction times will be fixed and become much cheaper with these solutions. Give it some time....this is about to get funky, and its great for the world.

You know they cant. Russia tried...went to ATH. Then China tried....it went to ATH, and BTC never missed a beat. Imagine if America tries....and it goes to a new all time high? That will prove the insignificance of the Fed. They can not afford to get it wrong...or else poof, there goes what little confidence the world has left.

Dooode. Tax mitigation is legal, yes....tax avoidance is not. Individuals would set up companies. 
Tax mitigation is obtainable if you can pay for all the services that you have to pay for (banks, lawyers, accountant, politicians in other countries etc.). If you can not pay for all those services (most people int he world), that means you and I have to pick up the "bill" for all the stuff we dont want to pay for.
In the G20, tax avoidance is illegal (im involved in a case right now about this) , you are allowed to mitigate your taxes....all these guys do it make that line very blurry. It's VERY illegal. But for all of us, we can now do the same thing...stop paying taxes like the big boys do.
Its illegal...but its going on at every level of income that has a phone. And whats even better, that BTC is more secretive than an offshore bank account for 1 million dollars of fees.
Im not suggesting anyone stop paying tax....but if you wanted to, BTC is literally better that an account in the Cayman Islands. 
If tax avoidance is illegal in UK, US, Canada yet there are loopholes to make it look legal for really rich guys to not pay taxes...then fuck this paying tax thing.
Its kinda like having a party. Your super stupid rich friends show up and trash the bar, drink all the booze, break all the windows then go to the bathroom and run out the back door. All of a sudden you have to pay the bill.

I have been using paper wallets for years with a BIP 30 password on them. But now that I want to move them, and upgrade  to bech32....the problem is, I dont know any way to "sweep" and be able to use my password to then move them again. 
I have been chatting with Blockstream Green wallet team, and they can sweep the keys and in one of the upcoming updates with allow me to then input the password so i can move them again.
Can anyone inform me, if I can get that done...will my coin automatically become bech32...or do I have to "do another step"? I dont really understand how they just become bech32 from a p2sh.
Any other ways to sweep my keys? Thanks team!

Who cares, what are they going to do? They cant even remove the stupid in the white house, Im not worried about them taking my BTC, after I Zcash it, send it to South America then Europe and buy Gold bars with it on the street etc. They do NOT have the resources. Wait until MAST, Schnorr signatures, Mimble Wimble, etc. The US government is literally 50 steps behind...they should worry about the next financial collapse...not $110 Billion dollar market cap. Russia Ban it, ATH...China Banned it, ATH, if the US Ban it and then ATH...then America will continue to be ignored as a force to be reckoned with. It is a very touchy political move, especially if they come out firm and fail. I welcome it. BTC will dip...and then the dust will settle and NO ONE will then answer to the US. It could literally be the collapse of the USD if they play this wrong...or close to it. What are they going to do the next financial collapse....print more? LOL! They are painted into a corner...and everyone knows it.

You do not have to subscribe, no one will be asking you, just be aware that it is becoming a very real possibility. Keep your head in the sand thats cool. Just do not be surprised IF it happens. And for the record, I am not saying it will, or that it would be good. It would be terrible, AND I would be happy to lose all my bitcoin value...just to wish it did not happen. I would gladly lose all my BTC and the world economy turn for the better.

It's a mockery of the law and of the people intelligence. As much I smell revolt in the air, I see no action on behalf of the people, so I buy more BTC. It will all come crashing down soon.

Thanks captain obvious, investment 201 (which I graduated from awhile ago): when global markets are crashing (thanks to criminal activity and impunity search "libor" as an example), what you do is get out.
There is no no guarantees in this world my friend, just past facts. The "facts" that can be "proven" today are on charts and constant criminal activity. There are TONS of facts about it. If you want to debate (there is no debate, only facts) this then perhaps you have an alternative motive for being on a bitcoin discussion forum, saying bitcoin sucks over and over. Suspicious really.
Most mega rich will not understand or feel comfortable with this system...yet. Wait until their portfolio is cut in half...or less and stays there. History is the only deciding factor, I remember some really bad things with trusting financial markets that no one understands, don't you? Schizophrenia has grabbed the attention of financial power brokers, fear. You thought 2008 was bad...you ain't seen nothin yet!

If Bitcoin is really understood by the people....then there is NO way the banks could ever control finance flow ever again. In 10 yrs, what will they say, "ok, we are back and we are better than ever...trust us!". "We are still centralized, private and connected to other banks, but faster and a new logo".

I believe they are called "shills". Usually paid for by financial institutions (not always) to push an agenda or stock on message boards. Or get enough people that want manipulate something. It's a VERY common practice...and they get paid. In North America you can make 100,000 USD as a shill, but over the years institutions with a base of greed as their foundation decided to "offshore" this skill set to where it's cheaper.

I can understand a few months of it slowing down because of fear or misunderstanding of the block size debate, but I really must agree with you, its time! The debate seems to be clearing up with some good understanding, the blockchain is stronger than ever (maybe a little crowded, but being fixed), the world markets are in shambles and NO One believes they lies that "everything is fine". Central banks are freaking out (Federal Reserve today said some pretty heavy stuff), stocks are literally plummeting, and there is WAY too much cash sloshing around the world thanks to Quantitative Easing (Q.E.) 1/2/3/etc. There is literally no excuse that I can see why this has not exploded. If we have to wait for a few of these heavily funded stratups in the bitcoin or blockchain space to come to market...it will create an ever LARGER price explosion! All signs are green I think...please, if anyone has a different opinion, I would really appreciate the education, concern and thoughts. Lets discuss this! I am so excited, I need a shower!!

This is money that has ALREADY been spent. If the someone wants to stop it, they can...and may.
Even if bitcoin replaces USD, government still has to be funded and government needs to spend to keep working. 
Sure it needs to be funded, but it will not be. Government will stop, or downsize considerably. They over overstepped, now its time to face the music...if not this time, then next. Its almost over, there are no more cookies in the cookie jar for these fat bureaucratic criminals to steal from. Sure they can print more, and that plays right into the hands of deflationary currencies like BTC and LTC. You see, the more officials spend, the more the "peoples" worth devalues. What would you rather HODL for long-term at these insane decisions? Not USD by a long shot. They have done it tothemselves and we have to thank them for the amazing rise of decentralized, immutable (very important), fixed supply, currencies. 
Song the hymn of bitcoin all you want. I do too. But don't tie government spending with success of it.
I encourage more of this reckless, indiscriminate spending with no accountability from Governments, all it does is compounds the success of BTC. They have done it to themselves....sorry, this horse has already left the gates, now I suggest you position yourself for an amazing few years of many black swan events.

The demand is not represented in the markets...but in the merchant processing. There is less and less liquidity in the market because no one is trading or selling their BTC, thus the mantra, "HODL". If everyone hodls, then the market can not be manipulated the way traditional markets are. You can not make "phantom" stock in Bitcoin world...if you can understand that, you will be very rich. 
If there was only 100 BTC being traded because no one wanted to risk trading theirs in the market...what would happen? You can't create more...
Look up the term "naked short selling" and "phantom shares". That's what the bankers WANT to do, but they cant, so it's just a game of wills right now...don't panic and don't sell, unless you really want to. The fundamentals of BTC have NEVER been stronger. HODL!!

Ok...I'll bite.
If EVERY government in the world agreed (that's pretty rare...never happened before, but maybe they will this time) said tomorrow, 15 years for using BTC or LTC....and lots of people still use it (they can not track them down, don't have the resources, focus or skill ), and the price goes up higher/faster than any fiat in the world (as it's been the best-performing currency over the last 5 of 6 years)....that would mean, Governments are irrelvelnt and no one cares, thus justifiying that what ever central authauirty demands, it will not matter. Irrelevance of Government. They risk proving to everyone that Governments do not matter at all....if they get it wrong.
It's a VERY slippery slope for sovereign nations. Think of it like this, the country says you cant drink booze (prohibition in America), yet business is flourishing and prices go through the roof and everyone LOVES playing in the underground economy....the government capitulates. They reverse their laws with their tail between their leg...and they want the tax money instead. Now, think about drugs in America...exactly the same thing.
The United Nations voted Unanimously about 3 weeks ago to stop the bombing in Syria/Ghuta...thats REALLY rare. You know what happened? Nothing...they kept bombing, and no one lifted a finger to enforce the world demand that the bombing be stopped...and that's more the point I mean to make.
You can make all the laws you want, but can you enforce them and how. You really think the world will FINALLY, all come together and work at last, in one direction...to combat this SCURGE called cryptocurrency? I feel your lack of understanding of the geopolitical complexity limits your ability to really understand the fragility of what governments can actually do or enforce (lots of history of them failing before).
This is a direct challenge to small groups of people that control invisible lines in the sand (this side is ours, that side is yours...pay 2% to cross, 25% for steel import, blah blah). This challenge cannot be countered...they cannot enforce anything, naive if you think THEY can. ever heard of offshore tax heavens? Every democracy hates them, yet they always get caught using them. In addition, there is thriving competition to attract more people (business) to one jurisdiction over another for "preferential tax rates". Bitcoin is like an offshore tax haven...with no one to go after, with no lines in the sand between nations, with no authority to reprimand. If you think there is, Id love to hear your opinion or thoughts on how it COULD be done.
We may disagree on this, but...who cares. Im buying like always since 2011. Good luck to you, all the best. HODL!

Look at the 200 day moving average for Bitcoin and the USD. Done!
We are above what BTC was Dec 1....so, 98% of the time it goes up. I'm really unclear on what your concern is....almost all the time it goes up, that's many times better than doing nothing or going down (which the USD is doing over the last 2 months).

I ain't going to pay for that if I have a choice...are you? Are you into paying for more prisons, bombs, rich guys on wall street making a profit for doing nothing with your money? Come on man, read! This is a pivotal socioeconomic turning point in history...because the people demand it, and the success is quantifiable. If the public did not demand this, the price would be zero. Your watching history and the use case is growing every day. Wake up. I can PROVE ownership of any information attached to a Satoshi, and transfer it around the world. Sell my house for Euro, US Dollars, Gold or beer...attach the deed to my house to a penny of bitcoin and send it to New Zealand (where ever), and I can PROVE by math the transaction was completed, no lawyer needed.

Jaime Dimon calls Bitcoin a fraud...yet JP Morgan is a criminal enterprise, as charged. 
Both can be manipulated, but one is a company that lies to the public via it's CEO. The other is a tool, like any tool can and has been used for negative uses...like the car, phone, guns, roads, etc.
All these tools can be used by bad actors, like Bitcoin and precious metals markets. Yet these tools have no leaders, like a CEO that lies.

Yes....the bitcoin is not the scam...the e-transfer is. The CASH/BANKING system can be scammed from the E-transfer side, it can be reversed, manipulated....not the Bitcoin. Once the Bitcoin has been transferred you cannot get it back.
Bitcoin is 100% transparent (thats what a public blockchain is),  and cannot be reversed. Banks like to think themselves secure...they are not, and they are not transparent. 
Did that help clarify? The fraud can only take place on the "cash" side, not the bitcoin side, as you must make the action to move your BTC. I cannot take your bitvcoin...only you can GIVE your bitcoin. 
I hope that helped.

There are ETF proposals on several exchanges around the world. If the SEC does not allow it...another country will soon allow it. This is Americas' to loose. Another thing, if the SEC does not approve this(there are actually several in this proposal) or the next few ETF's, and Bitcoin all by itself becomes successful, then the American financial system had nothing to do with it. This would be a massive win for BTC and a blow to any confidence in "The Old System".
Imagine BTC gets to $50,000 with no ETF? How many angry rich dudes on wall st would there be? Wall st must be involved or it will be rendered irrelevant. Its a self fulfilling prophecy.

Just announced tax free crypto gains in Portugal. Who cares if its free speech or not (it is), in America. It does not matter what America thinks, says, does, or rules. As long as one country (in this case Portugal and the others to follow), America is not relevant. 
Jurisdictional arbitrage...wiser countries will compete with one another to win my capital (BTC), our business creations and the ability of you and myself able to hire locals to build. 
This struggle is just beginning, but it will be a futile journey for the few that try to control it and force their rules onto others. If you restrict my ability to work, pay, invest etc....I will just move...simple as that, to another place that wants me more.

Yes I understood that, and I was meaning to refer towards they ALL deny service. That points to collusion and after doing my year-long research am coming to the conclusion that they deny any Bitcoin service provider. I have found two friendly banks that we are in discussion with, to open those services up, one has committed with caution, as a test but willing non the less. The other is an ongoing dialogue to facilitate these types of services in the near future...just trying to learn how to do it as properly as they can. 
I am always amused when reading my local news and another casino, real estate, government inadequacies are being exposed...when the solution is often the things we are talking about on this thread.

On the futures market, they don't even have to take delivery \(or send\) and actual physical Bitcoin...its just a paper contract. This open up massive potential for manipulation, as its only a paper contract...its just phantom shares \(if they desire\). This is exactly how the commodities market has been manipulated for decades....its a known joke.
Example: I believe BTC will be $14,000 in 2 months. You give me a piece of paper saying that you agree to give me the Bitcoin \(no need for the physical\) at that 2 month deadline...no matter what the price is, but absolutely no one transfer any Bitcoin, just the paper that says thats what its supposed to be worth. The difference will be settled in cash at the end of the contract...no asset needed. Just print some more fiat...
There is a new book out from, [Nassim Nicholas Taleb]( called "Skin in the game". In the example above, none of these guys actually have skin in the game...its a lark. Old dogs, behind computer screens, that have no idea how to open a BTC wallet.
If you are not committing/risking the actual asset...there is no risk to you. No skin in the game is why the markets are a scam, lets not be in a rush to "praise", big money and fancy tools...they are built for the little guy to be burned.
I would like to buy 1 trillion contracts saying Bitcoin will be worth $1 in 2 months....don't give me the bitcoin, just write it on a piece of paper, then tell the market that a huge whale is in a MASSIVE short for BTC. LOL! It's all IOU based.

Sure....they can try, and have been for awhile now...but look...its going higher, and will continue to do so. They will look like the antiquated, non-progressive sloths that they are at the end. Darwinism is at work here. Middle age white guys fear mongering has been going on forever, they usually end up capitulating, embarrassed.

lol...the largest money laundering locations in the world for Russian Money (and Chinese and Middle East...), is, and always will remain the US, UK, and EU. These are ALSO the largest laundering locations for drug cartel and organized crime. ALSO...the most off shore accounts of any individuals in the world...are citizens from US/ME/EU, and a few Russians and Eastern Block and African war lords etc. Iceland is not the problem, select rules for a few with political power, lawyers and banks that help them is the problem. Here is a current GREAT example of how to launder ill gains back into "civilized society":   .  Steal money from I dunno, Greece....pay bonuses in stock maybe? The current banking system is nothing more than a farce, and Iceland caught them red handed. Go Iceland! Schadenfreude to the current system....it's like watching a slow train crash, everyone know whats going to happen....don't they? I am not wanting it, it will be bad for everyone, some more than others.

You are correct my good man, It makes me happy that more folks are seeing the truth...keep learning, like all of us. The world is about to change very fast...with or without the relics approval. There is 200 Million South Americans that are sprinting to learn how to use BTC. This requires no approval from Wall St.
What helps, is to have 2 or 3 well rehearsed elevator pitches, to teach others depending on their sophistication or understanding of finances, and Bitcoin tech. Remain calm and listen...then teach them something they did not know or understand.

@_date: 2017-05-14 22:25:12
Why "cash out" for a billion? Wait for it to be worth trillions (of USD), then you never have to "cash out", because BTC will then be the reserve currency.

Hmmm..i see, so banks, and countries will continue to remain solvent, and have enough capital to battle the economic outlook? Have you not read whats going on? The massive concerns of global finance? All it takes is one more Lehman bank, or Greece, or Cypress, or Argentina or etc. Do you really think people TRUST the system with their money? Give it less than 24 months....then go to you traditional bank and TRY to withdraw $1000 Euro. I dare ya. The global debt has doubled (100%) in 7 years, yet the GDP has only in risen 1.7%. Hmmm...someone gotta pay back some money, especially if interests raise rise (they have to, because governments have no cash). Printing is ALWAYS an options, and the more they do, the worse it will be in when it reverses...which it will. tomorrow, or next decade. Inevitable. Hodl, long, buy, or trust the system to work for you, and do not.

@_date: 2017-05-25 08:11:49
A possible trick that could happen soon is whatever country starts to accumulate some bitcoin and diversifies its capital reserves with BTC....silently, then announces it to the world at a certain point then all other countries will participate. Whichever country does it first or second will give their people one of the greatest gift we can give...no debt. Utopia? This game is going to the moon. Whatever country does NOT ban it, will win. The game is on.

I have lost patience with the other half (a few percent is all there is really). They declared what they would like....now "my half" (a much larger percent), are dictating terms. 95% will never be reached...time to take action, and now we have the tools to let our voice be heard, rather than message boards and Twitter. Sorry, it maybe hard to swallow, but the people will speak . This is Bitcoin, let it win!

Sigh...after many months of trying to find a compromise, and seeing nothing competent coming from BU, no suggestion, no solutions, just constant failure in order to hijack and control BTC...I must agree. We MUST blow these turkeys out of the water. There will be no half measures, there is no sign that this disagreement will end, so UASF is the ONLY solution to get this over with. Less talking, it's time for action. Please for the love of Satoshi, let's end this NOW! We are wasting time, energy and focus because of a school yard fight by fools that have already lost on one side. BU has lost all credibility and respect from the majority of the community and they know it so they *have* to win as they are finished as pioneers, now they are just bullies and criminals. The most current history of their actions is what they will be remembered for not the past positive contributions (if they actually had any). Crush BU now

Same here, always works great, low fees....no problem, I use it everyday.
I usually don't buy coffee though....flights/hotels/purse.io/Newegg/etc.
Its amusing to hear people saying it's too expensive to use....don't be silly. I bought a plane ticket yesterday for $400 USD....I used BTC, which cost about $1.26 USd.

I was listening to a podcast and it KEPT stressing the importance of doing your OWN network validation. Does that mean I should use something like Armoury? It was suggested at best practice for security.....but I am not sure how to do my own network validation. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 02:58:47
Ever wonder why some countries ask for the end of offshore tax havens and some insist they continue to exist? Government greed to make money will always supersede collaboration. The first few countries that invest in Bitcoin for their basket of reserve currencies will be the richest. It will stop poverty and pay for medical and all retirement. 
If 3 or 6 countries slowly accumulate Bitcoin now silently....once all the other countries find out they will rush to buy some themsleves. All governments should be buying, if they want to survive. 
Like money, governments are about to become decentralized. 
No one respects governments anymore, or listens.

Yes it will...fundamentals are sound. Its the first global currency (that can not be denied). Every fiat currency in the world is in SERIOUS trouble. All sovereign allocated funds are inflationary...bitcoin is deflationary, that's enough said...fundamentals are great. $100,000 with in 5 years.

No...literally, once you set up an account (some kyc), you add them to your bank as an interact payee I think, and they tell you what email and code to add to the details before you send it.
Then $100 leaves your account, and a few hours later (took about 40 minutes for me), I got an email that there was $ 98.10 in my account to but BTC on their exchange. 
It was about $200 cheaper than one of the other exhcnages, quadriga for a whole BTC.
Once I bought the BTC, I transferred to Quadrida exchange which took 4 confirmations....then sold it for $106 .
