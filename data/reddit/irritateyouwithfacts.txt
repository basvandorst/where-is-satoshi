Are you verified on Binance? I don't think they can verify your identity with just a level 1 account. Not backing up your 2FA code is on you though.

This is the same with Bitfinex. Nothing too special.
The important question is: Did you send your verification documents before or after you were locked out of your account?
For me, I needed to take a photo with ID and a paper with the word "Binance" written on it.

Use Gemini then transfer to Binance or the other way around if you wanna withdraw. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:37:45
Switch to Binance

Very good point.

I guess you don't, but that goes for any exchange. What's important it that it isn't the same right now.

You feel safer using American based platforms like Coinbase/GDAX and Bittrex that has been confirmed to lock up funds (hundreds of thousands of dollars worth) for lots of people numerous times over a Chinese based platform that has no record of doing that? Ok then. Binance isn't perfect. It has that whole problem with dust but it's probably the best of all exchanges right now.

They have been more honest and straight shooting than Coinbase and Bittrex, American companies.

Yeah I use Gemini to convert fiat to crypto then transfer it to binance and do the opposite when cashing out. It's really great but the vol is a little low. BTC and ETH is more expensive there. Those 2 are my favorite as well!

I'm not in Europe so I have no idea about that. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:39:37
oh yeah, sorry about that buddy. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:51:02
There isn't a perfect exchange right now but Binance has been the best so far.

You sent your documents before or after you were locked out? That makes a difference. 
I back it up the moment the QR code shows up while setting up 2FA.  I can use it no matter how many times I've lost my phones or uninstalled Google authenticator. 
Seems like you've done everything in the wrong sequence.

Basically daily life in China with Alipay and Wechat for many years now. The exact same experience from an end user's perspective. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:01:11
Being controlled or not, isn't at all perceptible to the end user's experience.

I'm talking about the end user's experience. Bitcoin is obviously better for many reasons outside of end user's experience but it's great that bitcoin has reached a level that's able to provide the end user with an experience that's successful tried and test, and doing extremely well for hundreds of millions of people in their daily lives.
