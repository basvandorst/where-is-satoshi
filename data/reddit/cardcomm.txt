Your reply makes it clear you've never been a software developer. Or if so, certainly not in an enterprise web application, live money transfer setting. Software security goes FAR beyond the control of the developers. Yes, their code must be correct and secure.
But as others have said, the security burden rest far more on the system admins than the developers.
I believe most security problems arise from
1. Using hosted or co-located services where the admins are careless or corrupt.
2. Developers trying to "do it all" and develop the software as well as managing security. It can be done, but it's risky, and not for the faint of heart. Especially when irreversible financial transactions are at stake.

I made that assumption based on your naive remarks about security, and the responsibility of developers. 
Yes, on a desktop application it's critical that all code be correct. It's especially true of c/c++ applications that are so prone to buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
However, MUCH of the responsibility for the security of a live money web application fall on system administrators, and NOT the developers. If there are vulnerabilities in the http servers, app servers, load balancers, user account setup, etc. the application can be compromised before the developer's code ever runs!
It was your apparent lack of recognition of these issues that cause me to form my assumptions.
Tell me again - how many of the thousands of applications your company has deployed are WEB APPLICATIONS dealing with live money transfers or trading?
