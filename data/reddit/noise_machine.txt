This looks good. 
The original inspired me to try and make one too. However, I didnt/couldnt finish it and left it half way.
Yours is way better, but here is [mine](

Leverage is a loan that is provided to an investor by the broker that is handling his or her account. So a leverage of 1:2 means, if you have 5 bitcoins, you can trade with 10 bitcoins and the margin will be calculated on that. 
If  there is a 5% profit margin you will get,
5+(.05x10) = 5.5 
and not 
5+(.05x5) =5.25. 
Essentially a leverage of 1:2 will double your profit. However the downside is that if you trade at a loss, your loss will be doubled too.
