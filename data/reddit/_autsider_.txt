Can somebody just tell me why there are always two sides on The one who always HODL and if you discuss with them they virtually spit in your face because they can't discuss with you and the other side wich always foresee the bubble has bursted and BTC is going to die. Is there anyone out there wich take the situation cool and are like "Let's look what's happening and then decide"? Someone who doesn't sell because some people say it bursted and don't hodl until the very end because it's stupid.

Reddit is a only german speaking website? Didn't know that. And because it's interesting for everyone to see that it works very good. Some people here are interested in the progress of LN.

Yeah. Had the same problem. Living now somewhere in Austria where I have to get my internet from trees. But it was worth it. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:37:02
Maybe Asia panic selling since it is allowed in south korea again if you have a verified bank account OR it's because of the Tether problem that currently was (Tether is connected to the USD) OR maybe chinese new year. Who knows but that's the info I got but I don't really know wich one it is.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:29:55
Have u tried bitpanda.com?
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:21:27
Hopefully it will turn good for you. Good luck for 2018

Been into BTC since 2014. Really like the idea and especially the technology behind it. The side effect (wich I personally must say I never expected) was the extrem increase of it. I work in a tax office and was into the whole stock market things before I even knew BTC so BTC right now is connecting two things I'm very interested in it.
I think (both market and technology sides) it will increase again, for sure, and yes, it'll hit the 20k again and I also think it will go higher. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:41:44
What do you think I have done with that. I literally made gold out of shit. Real BTC magician here lol
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:35:21
Sold. Bought btc when it was 9k € :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:45:28
The "until the very end" was only pictorially. My opinion is the same as yours.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:43:05
Because Australia isn't Austria
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:26:02
Got it for free if you had some BTC left on coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:37:15
Wow thats stupid. Thats as stupid as calling bitcoin old, making a new crypto currency and just add a "cash" behind the bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:33:05
bitte gerne geschehen :-)

Transfer your btc to GDAX.com, a trading site from Coinbase. Then from GDAX to electrum. Boom, no transfer fees. Oh but fyi, the transfers from Coinbase aka GDAX are delayed atm. But it's never a bad thing to get your BTC off from Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:37:52
Localbitcoins, btc atm
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:44:41
It worked quite good. As you can see in the video it worked very good. You can skip the talking. They only explain what LN is and how it works and that they wanted to test it on BTC ATMs. Then they showed how fast the transaction goes and that was the first time LN was tested on a BTC ATM. That's the story
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:40:51
Fuck Coinbase already

Naa I'm pretty happy when a dip appears. It's sale time again
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:34:26
And stop posting shit like "It's a bubble". Or my all time favourite: "I saw a post on 9Gag, the post compared a Bubble with the BTC price. It must be true!"

Haven't you read the subreddit guidlines?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:33:59
Best solution for it would be buying it from localbitcoins or use mycelium marcetplace (from the app). 
So in short answer: Face to Face via Cash would be the best anonymous transaction. For the most of the exchange markets you have to verify yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:34:15
Slushpool. For sure.

Welcome to the Coinbase World! Where the support only says to you "f**k you"! Isn't it nice?
Anyways, when it fails to verify your gdax account, you get a coinbase mail. Click the "Send verification again" link in the mail. Then you get into your coinbase account on a site where all your failed tries are that you made. Try verify there with your passport on coinbase. If you are lucky, like me, it will work. 
I had the same problem. Had a verified coinbase account with my passport, couldnt verify my gdax cause cant verify my passport again because I had it before on coinbase, tried my drivers license, failed horribly, asked the support, didn't got an answer (yet, tried it 4 weeks before), clicked the link in the mail and got onto a coinbase site where there was a link to verify again, choose passport, made photos on the phone, clicked the link in the SMS verification service from coinbase on my phone. Uploaded, done. 
Hope that helped.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:36:04
Found the link
Try uploading your passport (or whatever) there. If, lets say, drivers license didn't work, try passport :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:46:27
And I can't sell that shit on Coinbase cause all the Bitcoin Cash transactions are paused. Stupid shit.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:01:04
Depends on from where you are. The prices of BTC won't change much but the fee prices will. Gemini for US Citizens is pretty good on having low fees atm. If you are an european citizen, try kraken, bitstamp or bitpanda
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:25:13
Only available for US citizens. Sitting in Europe and crying

If you live in the US, I think so. If the rest of the world: dividend tax is normally automatically controlled by your bank or if you gain over the income limit, you have to report it to your local tax office. But as I sayed, if you live in the US, i have totally no idea :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:39:14

Decentralizing the banking system is just a small (but very effective) side effect. I don't really think that the government would trying to stop bitcoin because they can earn from it too. Only the incometax. But anyways, the government could definetly not ban miners, miners are nothing more than computers build for mining (sort of) and the government couldn't just ban that things. GPU Rigs are 95% computer parts. But the government could definetly do something about bitcoin transactions but the possibility that this would happen is pretty low. I work at a tax office in Austria and all my collegues and also our whole financial system (excluding the private banks) all think, that bitcoins are going to have a future here. And gladly our government and co are very open to this things. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:30:08
So glad I moved away from that shit site
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:21:02
Sorry but. A what? And why? We don't have that here in Austria but I'm interested on the topic. If someone could explain
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:39:24
Hmm. So you also can't call someone down there? 
When did you made the account? I would never do that due the financial crisis going on. Normally for opening a bank account the bank also needs a copy of your passport or drivers license. Can't you just send that to an e-mail? Or try contacting the greek embassy in the US.

What? Really? Try messaging there support. I think they are pretty good. They message back pretty quickly. I got verified (except for the ID live webcam thing because of christmas lol) in about 2 days. Starting from christmas 24th to 25th.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:34:02
Wow thats...a lot of work for them. Gladly we don't have such things yet.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:16:47
wtf was that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:47:26
I think it's because of the delay atm. 
I'm also still waiting for my btc to get transfered. Wich transfer fee did u use?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:52:11
Why should they? With what reasons? They had to ban computers too? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:03:09
Every btc you don't have in your private wallet isn't your btc. 
If a company get's hacked like nicehash, you can loose alot.
