I don't think you understand the concept of money laundering. Please read up on it before proceeding with this discussion.
Hint: there is NO money 'launder' if no crime has been committed.

He has drunk the bitcoin koolaid man, there's no reasoning with him...

Of course you will.

Elaborate. Why would you need to 'evade' a corporation? How does money laundering aid you to achieve that goal?
I think you are confused. Money laundering is ALWAYS originated from an illegal activity. If you haven't commited a crime, it is impossible to commit money laundering because there is no dirty money to launder (as in, originated from illegal activities)

Where the hell do Bitcoin Fanboys do their internet banking that: A) closes down for the holidays?
B) Doesn't have security measures?
C) Charges fees for everything? (granted, avoiding fees does require the person to think)

*sigh* What other reason would you have to launder money other than evading authorities?

Yes I mean, it is a nice thing and all. But THOUSANDS of other charities both big and small receive donations and work just fine without BitCoin... I think people are holding this Hobby in too high esteem IMO

If I was in say Australia, wouldn't I be able to wire him some money to a bank account?
