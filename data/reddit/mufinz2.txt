The crypto community, awareness and publicity has increased by orders of magnitude.

everyone when markets rise: "wish a dip would come so I could buy more!"
when dip shows up: "Don't want to catch a falling knife bruh"
rinse &amp; repeat.

Absolutely nothing has changed with bitcoin since it was 20k. “Markets marketing” have put the deal of the year on a silver platter for us. My year end bonus couldn’t come sooner.

When price drops, ppl look for reasons why its dropping and ignore the reasons why it could or should be rising.
When price rises, ppl look for reasons why its rising and ignore the reasons why it could or should be falling.
Rinse and repeat ad nauseum.

They cannot shut down bitcoin. They CAN shut down the exchanges within the United States but the bitcoin network itself is unkillable unless you turn off the internet entirely. The US can't stop China/Russia/South Africa from trading bitcoin or running nodes &amp;amp; mining. The US also can't stop its own citizens from using vpns to access the network or trade on exchanges outside the US. Nor can they stop US citizens from owning bitcoin since wallets are cryptographic keys that are completely neutral. 
The only way for governments to deal with bitcoin is to adapt to bitcoin. If they try to fight it they will lose and look like idiots in the process.

They’re a business, not a charity. And offering a very unique service that almost no one else is able to do. They’re allowed to make money and the amount they collect is driven by competition, not catering to an entitled community. I still cant believe Binance gave in to this shit last week.

Lol, this isn’t some stock index fund with expected annual returns of 7%. This is crypto, where shit goes up or down by 10% fucking daily. Give me a break on the annual 2%.

If the hardware in your trezor dies you can buy a new trezor, import the seed you hand wrote down when you first setup your trezor and voila, you have all your wallets back.

Decentralization means any rag tag group of developers can fork your chain and start a new one with different rules if the current chain is not satisfactory to the majority or even a subset of the majority. Thats how governance is done. Has nothing to do with partnerships of the core developers. Assuming open source code, communities can deviate from the core developer’s agenda at any time on other altcoin blockchains just like bitcoin can.

Bitcoin is cryptocurrency the way the Lord intended.

Value would collapse but the network would still survive.

There is not enough money in the world to do that as the price would keep going up as that individual bought more and more. Think 1btc = $1M levels of price absurdity from an action like that.
