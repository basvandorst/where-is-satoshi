Corporations literally give millions of people cancer every year through cigarettes. They manipulate people into buying addictive things.
Many big corporations evade taxes in a massive way.
They do bad things, but they are usually things that do not directly affect a single person. They do things that benefit themselves at the great expense of everyone else.
E.g. if a company started massively polluting the atmosphere (as many already do) then no single person would be able to name the pollution as a cause of their cancer or respiratory disease. But overall the detrimental affect is massive as it would indeed increase the rates of cancer and respiratory disease.

Yes, it's very anti capitalist. But it's also very anti government too - everyone in the government seems corrupt or incompetent. That's not very in line with socialist values. It's more anarchist values.

I'm guessing you don't watch the show then?
Besides, the show has many guns in it. This is pure right wing propaganda. I'm surprised you haven't realised it, they're brainwashing people into protecting the 2nd amendment and being constitutionalists.
See? I can be stupid too.

If you believe in free will then you may as well believe in magic. I don't have time to explain to you why free will is an illusion.

In this show there's quite a bit of tension between USA and China.
