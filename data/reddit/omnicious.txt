What does that even mean?

Damn I made a joke limit order last night at 12000. Did not expect it to actually fill.

Is Capital one faster at getting the money to coinbase? It's always around 7-8 business days for me.

Man you would be a terrible sponsor at AA.

Keep in mind that's only the funds. Cryptos are not protected I think.

Those are not the words I would say when the IRS comes for their cut. Unless you're the church of scientology I would just face the music now and realize they'll take their pound of flesh one way or the other.

So wait till next week to buy then?

Is there a downside to this? I'm thinking about doing the same but also wonder why everyone doesn't do the same thing in case of a big drop. Or does everyone do this and I'm just out of the loop?

And I just fucking bought in last night...
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:08:14
This is part of why I didn't trade for other crypto this year. Probably going to dabble in it a bit next year. Seems like a headache. Wanted to give myself a whole year to figure that shit out.

It wasn't even that hard. I bought it at 18500 (such bad luck too. I'll admit I had been telling myself to wait for it to dip to 17000 but then bought the night before the "crash" due to FOMO). After I saw all the BCH news I pretty much didn't check the prices at all. My bad habit of avoiding my problems allowed me to blissfully ignore the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:03:58
Man I'm just hoping my funds fucking show up on gdax in time to take advantage of the dip. Been a week now.

Why are they not worried about the lions going after the humans?

I am not looking forward to having to sit down and figure out my taxes with all the buying of alt-coins I did this year...
@_date: 2018-10-15 01:01:05
I wasn't aware there was a way to get alt coins besides buying and trading Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:15:15
It's not really the financial loss. It's the having to sit down and do the maths.
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:52:03
But I had to buy Bitcoin or Litecoin and "sell" it for other alt coins.

Man I went Eddie Murphy in the Klumps for this scene.

You can kinda ignore code. Bomb is going to affect you whether you want to or not.
@_date: 2018-07-15 21:05:09
When you say precious metals are you suggesting that we buy gold and silver and bury them in spots around town?
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:43:03
So would bitcoin suffer if drugs are legalized?
