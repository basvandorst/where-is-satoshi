May they provide you with much velocity as we ascend back to the moon. Amen.

Actually, that was then. Now is now.

That's what a stop-loss order is for.

It's mostly priced in, but that doesn't mean we aren't going to keep tumbling a bit. [Bloomberg estimates BTC falling to $2,877]( and that's if it can hold.

China is closing crypto exchanges and everyone's panic-selling.

Place a stop-loss order on an exchange at the maximum price you'd be willing to rebuy if this was the bottom of this dip. If it keeps dropping, you can cancel your stop-loss and buy at market value, and if it ends up going back up, you'll have a failsafe.

No one knows for sure, there's a lot of speculation that it's going to slow up transactions and cause a crash. At the same time, we're still waiting for the Lightning Network to be implemented, and atomic swaps.
Bitcoin is currently a high-risk investment.

Unfortunately, Coinbase limits their deposits to something like $15,000 per week after verification, and they have a [base rate fee of 4%]( unless you're making a cash deposit from your bank.
I don't know enough about depositing large amounts to skirt around the limit and fee issues. I know the limit increases the more you use their services, but if you contact them directly there may be a better way to go about getting that much deposited at once.

While the China ban is still speculative, there have been some big names throwing around the rumor. Bloomberg and WSJ have been kindling the fire and the fact is no one is positive about what's going to happen.
It could shoot straight through $5,000 just as easily as tumbling back to sub $3,000. We're all crossing our fingers for the former, but until the People's Bank of China makes an official statement, we're going in blind.

Chill out. This crash is news related - J.P. Morgan investors are dumping, and this is hurting a lot of external sources, most likely because of the anxiety in China about whether or not BTC is being banned.
Bitcoin will recover; it **always** recovers. If you needed this money in the next couple of months, you shouldn't have invested it. That guy saying we're all in the same boat is right - and the price will crash for a while because people are panicking. Pull out now if you're scared or want to buy at a lower price, but the truth is **no one knows how low this will dip**. We might be at the bottom right now, if you sell, you could lose hundreds. If you hold, you could lose hundreds.
I personally want to improve my position, so I'm selling and buying incrementally with the crash.
**Edit**: *I also want to point out that in the time I wrote this, the price rose, fell, and rose beyond my last purchase. You can't let your emotions play a role in this. Read the news and think about what you want to do.*

OKCoin and Houbi are probably next, they just met with the regulators today.

Buying on an exchange is your best bet, but you'll have to wait for your money to transfer. You could try to wire it in, which is supposed to take about a day, but I've heard people complaining that it still took a week sometimes.
Frankly, if you intend to hold your investment and then sell down the road, the fee is negligible on a large scale. Buying with a fee guarantees you lock in the price - if you transfer money, it could have easily gone up a ton in value by the time you're able to spend the deposit.
