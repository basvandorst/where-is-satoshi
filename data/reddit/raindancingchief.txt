I've been getting a few questions from family I don't normally talk to until the holidays. I'm sure I'll be explaining what bitcoin is when I'm home at Christmas.
Really want to tell people some absurd amount of money I've made off it and then laugh in such a way that implies "I'm kidding" but leaves them wondering "Is he really?".
This is going to be fun. I already had some guy at work accosting me about how much I've made, etc. Was hilarious. Yet if you try to explain it to these people they really don't give a shit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:02:32
Congrats mate, you just summarized the entire crypto market.
This little correction is nothing to get excited about, we're still 30% up on the month ffs. We'll likely hit 20k by mid January. Look at everything set to happen in the market in the next month or two. That's all the evidence you need.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:38:52
Think it might be, especially if there's a huge rally again after this dip (healthy one at that). Would have been nice to get in on that.
I had tried moving this originally when it was still floating just above 13k, then it jumped to 17k+. So it really was a sort of blessing in its own way. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:36:32
We really need to get the point across that buying bitcoin is basically the same as buying another currency. It IS currency. It's the same as travelling to a different country and having to buy their currency with your home countries.
For ease of understanding, Bitcoin is a currency, not a thing.

Something to do during the day
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:54:03
I paid my car off last year using some extra money I got for working out in the field (I work in engineering, let's call it "camp pay" for ease of understanding). Ended up paying about $17k (CAD). So that was obviously a big chunk of my savings. In May I started slowly buying btc, then buying larger amounts in $1k increments for a total of about 6k.
Needless to say in the last 6 months I've gotten that $17k back and then some. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:54:36
Yeah, because the US dollar isn't
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:47:42
A guy I work with was like this. He was insufferable. Mostly because he put money into a bunch of different alts just to be different. He refuses to put any into bitcoin out of spite and I think that he's been telling his friends to do the same.
And no, he has no idea how any of them work or what they're for.
Meh, more for me.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:41:11

This is what I tell people who think it's too expensive now (other than explaining that it's not a stock you need to buy 1 of, etc). People thought it was too expensive when it was at $200, look at where we are now. Never too late to get involved. Throwing a couple hundred bucks at it could very easily turn into a few thousand.

And I was anxious after throwing another $1000 at BTC when it was below $2k a few weeks ago...
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:31:57
I'm in this boat from the most recent boom. I bought in initially at sub $1600 earlier this year. When it spiked up like it did (ether included) suddenly I'd made double what I'd put in so of course I pulled it out.
Then I had to rebuy at a higher rate. You're much better off using any trading to simply increase your personal bitcoin volume imo. Trading the waves on alts until bitcoin goes to the moon. Not trading with everything you've got, but take 10% and play with it.

Some of the execs at BC Hydro have been talking about crypto miners and cannabis grow ops and how we should be trying to get them to set up shop in BC and use our power. 
Been an interesting year for us since we went through a reorg. They make some pretty good points though. Power out here is cheap, there's lots of land and fresh water that could be used for cooling or otherwise. Be a good spot for miners.
@_date: 2019-08-08 04:34:55
Someone who's more familiar with this:
What is the likelihood with today's current pools, etc. of a 51% attack? My understanding is that's one of the sort of "core" benefits of bitcoin is that it's, ideally, supposed to be virtually impossible because of the open nature or at least that was one of the original intentions such that it being completely open to anyone to do, it would take a MASSIVE collaboration and effort to do this. 
I might be butchering the terminology.

This is what I don't understand about all the bitching. BTC is still WAY in the green. Take advantage of this pump and move on back when the coast is clear. I've more than doubled my hodlings by taking advantage of this pump and will move back to BTC when it's all overwith.

And irrelevant. That was 40 years ago. He doesn't personally direct every single one of his subsidiaries on what do think and say.
Safe to say most people don't know who you're talking about without looking it up. If you dig deep enough into any paper trail you'll find some asshole at the end of it.

That's all I'm here for, I'm not into jumping off high things.

Newbie here:
Is there a place I can go that will breakdown what all these things are? I have a pretty basic understanding of how bitcoin works and would like to learn more.

Can someone bring LTC back up a little temporarily so I can sell it for more BTC? 
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:34:21
Good, I've been increasing my hodlings and am now ready for them to moon with all the new buyers after the hype train cometh. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:08:23
You're right, I'd rather sit.

Keeps you young. I showed the charts to a buddy at work that does a fair amount of day trading, I thought he was going to have a heart attack.

I can definitely see where he's coming from though being relatively new to cryptos myself. I had 3ETH at one point and it made it easy to keep track of how much money I had if I sold, little trickier with a fraction of a bitcoin for newcomers. 
Being cheaper also helps the appeal with potential money growth short term. ie I don't have to invest as much of my own money to see it grow substantially in a short term. $100 swing with BTC is nothing, but with altcoin it can be the difference of hundreds, even thousands of dollars, which may be all some people want to see. Especially some Joe Blow off the street just looking to make a quick buck.

I'd even go higher than that if you include Rogan. Depends how far you stretch "associates" I suppose.

I wouldn't say a lot of money as I'm trading with small amounts and haven't sat down and played the bounces as much as I'd like to (still learning to read the charts, etc), but I doubled my portfolio the first time crypto jumped up back in May.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:24:18
I'll be honest, I have no idea what I'm talking about. Looked to be a bull trap but the nosedive hasn't happened yet.

200 was the ATH once. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:01:19
I definitely started out in the "get-rich-quick" sort of mentality after hearing how much a colleague was making while trading it. You quickly realize how much bigger it is than that.

If this has done anything, it's created a lot of seasoned hodlers
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:57:34
and then down 15%, then back up, then down...
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:33:38
For sure, I just think most newbies only really care about dollar amounts more than %. Especially on something where $50 is a huge swing where as with BTC it's like a minute by minute thing (with CAD anyway).

You and I share a lot of the same sentiment. I'm still pretty new into it (last June during the start of the rise) but am in it for the long term as I'm in full support of the idea behind bitcoin and how no one entity can control it. I throw what I can afford to invest in every now and then thinking not a few days, weeks or even months down the road, but years. Trade the giant swings if I can even be bothered to and wait for cool downs to buy again (a luxury when you invest this low, everything is profit!).

Heh, fuck you non-believers!
