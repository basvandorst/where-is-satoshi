BITFLOOR.  It took me a couple weeks of trying before I gave up on Mt. Gox.  With Bitfloor, I had coins within the hour.  Can't recommend it enough.

So far it seems that the price on Bitfloor is generally a few dollars USD higher than Mt. Gox.  I've seen them anywhere between matching and about a 6$ difference, but generally the same ebbs and flows apply to each.

Thanks for replying.  I was at your site again today and tried to live chat, but after about an hour of leaving the window open, didn't see a reply.  
Just wanted to know what payment methods you accept, especially if Dwolla is among them.

Thanks.  I was at ziggap earlier today.  It seems these sites are setup for users that come to them already knowing the drill.  It's easy to be dissuaded from signing up for a company if you're unsure of how exactly the site works.  Especially when bank info is involved.  It's definitely on my radar though.
Though I rambled about my own issues, the crux of my post is mostly about the user-unfriendliness of bitcoin and related services at the moment.

This is the issue I'm running into.  I think bitcoin has a huge and ready user base, but sending pics of highly personal documents and bank info is keeping them(us) out of it.

Seems to me that there is no legitimate, fundamental reason why this dip is occurring - just the vagaries of a new, unstable market.  This makes me believe that it won't last and the price will rise again.
Of course, the argument can certainly be made that there is not a good enough legitimate, fundamental reason that it rose this high this fast to begin with.  Either way,  Anyone completely changing their strategy in the face of this  probably shouldn't have been  risking the money to begin with.

Isn't this a repost on ycombinator from a comment originally made on reddit?  We're in danger of destroying both sites in a feedback loop here.
