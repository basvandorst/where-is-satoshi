I tried to review again. It was big stake to bet who will hold these. If could not find on time, then would be deformed very fast just like Bitcoin. Of course after understanding, some people pay a very large sum of dollars to protect that one believed at all cost. Have you studied tencent company (China PRC) or Nintendo ? These people seldom say dot com. I personally seldom say this even I do something like this. I am here acting like a high class waiter Or A rider who can operate Honda(R) CB250,5 speed manual old model, to deliver food on site and on time. This can be Ramit's plot. Before his talk, I already got that during being a Bitcoin trader, he just reminded me once again , I accepted.

No one know the results. For me , I was a bit late when asking how deep it is.
For some people, they are lucky. For some people, If dump all today, you only are able to use at most 70% of the money. (in Canada and USA)

The stuff is on updated patch of android 7.0 which I have been using months.I also have reviewed my side before I post this.  Just like others, 2FA, long pass and etc. if the things were stolen,then could be stolen within 10 seconds.  To conclude, it seems someone such as old exchanges luckiky get the number, or is done by an insider. 
Even BIP44 is designed as theft resistent.  I even follow these rules.  it only reduces being robbed.
Bad luck? This can be being robbed, being crashed, being mad, died of bronze John and so on.

I am still finding. But it seems the address should be accidentally found by someone as I am using BIP44. I also read a note from pastebin. There are some addresses cant resist from the form of attack mentioned.

There are at least two things which All have to be careful, BTG is coming, and the SegWit2X is coming too. The second item can be major problem.

Actually, the Japan is not the coinman. They knew the potential of the play after the the outsider blasted because of his own front software faults.

Possibly yes.
When someone in, then someone out. Let see what will be last.
I believe, There are lots of things to do. The first important thing is, getting permits before more actions.

It's hard to know which is the actual one. If in a hurry, then try buying from others. Or bet on alt-coin.

This is what a user who create directory.io says.
