As a Chinese BTC investor, you hurt my feelings. 
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:40:24
I f""king said it once and I will say it again: bitcoin and Blockchain are not separable, there is no such thing as "bitcoin bad, Blockchain good". Have banks and governments produced anything remotely successful with blockchain?

Can anyone please piss off trump so he will ban Bitcoin? We may really moon if that happens.

Couldn't agree more on this. Data vendor is a f\*\*king legal business, everyone sells your data. Also, there are so many cases of data breach, and you know why online/telephone scam have a high success rate in China? Yes, you are right the scammer actually have all your data. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:16:22
Can't remember where I got the data. The data you quote is probably correct but bear in mind that 120 million of Chinese are over 65 years, plus another 150 million under 14 years, that's almost 25% of total population. If you count 14-65 years only, it should be above 80% and 14-55 should definitely above 90%. I have yet to meet one Chinese who does not use Wechat.
In rural China, you can buy fake iphone for $50, and it actually functions very well, you can install WeChat (or even Facebook) in there. Huawei or even Xiaomi are not in this market segment. One online-retailer (which just listed on Nasdaq) specifically target this market, they sell 50in LCD TV for around $100 and these TVs actually works.  They also sell washing machine for around 480RMB (about $70) and it functions pretty much the same. You can search the website yourself ([ or just google story about it. The site utilize WeChat to group customers for discounted deals, it will not work if no one uses WeChat.  Anyway, 2018 is definitely the year of rural China.
@_date: 2018-09-11 09:02:43
I am at work so will keep this short. WeChat's current market penetration is about 98% in the city and 97% in the rural area. So everyone uses Wepay even in remote rural areas. Your statement is probably true 5 years ago, but not in 2018. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:18:30
You obviously don't know China. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:42:13
Well, a lot things are banned and yet still exist in China. For example, Facebook is banned, but Chinese still use it.

Zerohedge again, they told everyone to short the US stock market for the last 8 years. They also said the Japanese economy will crash. What else, oh, they said gold is going to be $10,000 per ounce. I will read it as a science friction.
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:04:42
The massive gains and losses could happen for other reason : maybe we are in a crypto super bull cycle right now. In this super bull cycle, every time price drop comes with more aggressive rebound. If this super bull cycle last 10 years, which means we are near the end of it, then something completely different will happen in the next few years. For example, price could crash to 0.
I say this because this is exactly what happened during 1992-1998 bond market bull run. Massive crashes and huge gains during these 6 years.

@_date: 2019-11-20 11:15:49
Thank you very much so far, do you know anything else that can measure Bitcoin activities on the ground? Any way people can trade? I want to see the actual data. LocalBitcoins is good but do we really have anything else?
@_date: 2019-11-20 11:13:34
Just as I guessed, the irony is that when news break out about a crisis in a thrid world country, adoption in the USA actually increased. There was a research paper about this "Bitcoin and Bailout", 
About data, there are actually some data from LocalBitcoins, but their volumns are heavily affected by google search trend. Even in Turkey during rapid currency devaluation, not much evidence about "the Bitcoin is saving the people" claim. Though, I want to be proved wrong. I want to see Bitcoin as everyone here claims it to be. But data wise, it is just not there.
@_date: 2019-11-20 11:16:09
OK, got it, thank you.
@_date: 2019-11-19 19:20:08
There was a research paper about this, they examined the Cyprus bank bail in clause, and bitcoin related app download. The results is that bitcoin adoption didn't increase after the introduction of the bail in clause. I am on mobile, I can show you the paper later.

Dollar is still the go to asset for moving large sum around, well, you could get robbed in the process, and government can easily take away your cash.
@_date: 2019-11-19 19:17:31
I do agree, but general population still don't use it, even during crisis times.

I will chip in my opinion. I doubt the compromise is Trezor related, there was already a lot that dicussion here. I don't think I can offer anything new. Maybe think slightly outside the box? Probably your PC is compromised in other ways? Does anyone else use this PC/laptop? Do you use it for any other purposes? Do you mine bitcoin using this machine? Does your relative/colleagues/friends know about your bitcoin holdings? Have you received any scam email? Is it possible your wife opened a  malicious email on this PC? Also, how do you spend BTC? What do you use it for? Who do you pay BTC to? Do you have USB drive, could it be compromised? 
If I were to steal your coin, I would find the weakest part of your entire digital/physical life. Probably not Trezor which is design to be foolproof. Anyway, you don't need to answer any questions here, I am just suggesting avenues for possibilities. Hope this can help you in some way.

Move Staoshi's bitcoin or i don't believe anything written there.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:08:26
This will zero impact on Bitcoin!
Why? If government ban mining completely, OK, bitcoin lost 51&amp; of mining power. So hash power drops and it will be profitable to mine even in some high electricity cost places, .e.g. California 
If there is no government ban, there is even less problem. Why? Because all the miners in China do not and will not work together. They all want to make money and be the self-ruled king.

Something that can be explained in 20 seconds runs on and on for 20 minutes. At least write the three things in the description. When he mentions these three thing, it's literally 1 second, so I can't even find these 3 things by skiping the video. He is good at one thing I am pretty sure, and that is wasting other people's time.

I know at least two book published before 2007 that predicted the 2008 crisis. Try search them: 
1. Black swan (2007) by Nassim Taleb
2. Dollar crisis (2005) by Richard Duncan
Then there is a lot research papers before 2007 talking about the systemic risk from government mortgage garrantee. I am on mobile, but I can find these paper for you if you want to have a read.

I guess I will get downvoted again, but here I go anyway.
The past few years see a lot of financial innovations, banks are starting to get very competitives now. I still remember my credit cards charge 3% foreign transaction fee a few years ago, then Revolut came and all credit cards stopped charging fee for foreign currencies. Then there is a lot of FinTech firms, payment processors, p2p lending, online investment funds,etc. I just feel at this speed of development, Bitcoin will slowly faded away as all its advantages are copied by conventional banks or tech start ups. But I could be wrong, I have been wrong in the past. The upcoming halving will be a good telling time, if prices do not agressively appreciate at that time, people will just slowly lose interest.

One question from me today:
Two previous all time high are achieved by manipulation, 2014 is Mt gox fake buying bots, 2017 is the Tether printing. Not sure about ATH earlier than 2014. So, unless we have some sort of manipulation/exploitation, we may not see another ATH again in 2020. What do you guys think?
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:21:54
I don't think anyone has made this point before but here is what I see. All previous crashes occur when the global economy  is fine. Bitcoin is created in 2009 right after the last crisis, so the price moved basically alone the economical cycle. Since 2009 we haven't experienced any globalised crisis (something similar to 2007-2008) yet. Sure, they are regional crisis in emerging market but they always have problems economic wise. 
The booming economy has a very special feature - QE created large amount of financial liquidity, which means more funding seeking less investment opportunities. This policy is pretty universal across all major countries, US, EU, China and India. So despite Bitcoin crashes, there are still millions of capital that need big returns. Naturally, FinTech and Startup are where money goes to these days. These funds would pick up Bitcoin again after price stablised. 
But what happens when there is a real crisis? Something so serious that 2008 looks like walk in the park. US dollar had survived at least 10 different crisis. Can Bitcoin do that? When credit really dry up, and there is no money flow in, what happens? I don't think a 5-year hodler mean anything, your observation is simply not long enough. No one really knows what would happen. 
 
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:32:54
US dollar has survived countless crisis, how about Bitcoin? Since creation in 2009, it's riding the economic booming trend. Can it survive a real crisis? All previous crashes happened when fundamentals of general economy was fine, so your hodling experience since 2009 does not even count. We have seen nothing yet. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 18:20:42
My thoughts today is that Bitcoin will get side-tracked, meaning prices won't go down nor up. It will be there for many years but will gradually lost popularity. Revolut was such a hassle free app for exchanging currencies. But I just recently find out that my bank has also introduced competitive exchange rate without commissions, don't know when they did it but they definitely aim these changes at Revolut. So Revolut immediately lost its charm when banks start maneuver and being competitive again. Maybe the same thing will happen to Bitcoin, it is still difficult to use and too complex to store for average consumers. Browsing post here feels like reading news a propagenda machine. I guess we will have a long long time before anything get interesting again.

Thank you very for doing this AMA, you mentioned food support from government. Does that mean most can literally live for free, with government supplied food?
Second question, what is the easiest way to transfer money into the country? Does USD transfer work? Or you need to use crypto for money transfer?

Well, its zerohedge, the site keep telling everyone to short the US stock market, and also buy gold. I am actually quite surprised they still exist.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:51:23
There are just regular e-banker, which do a lot of things. E.g. Deposit, withdraw, transfer, pay utility, even open a new account. The machine can even generate a credit card within 10 minutes. But they are not cryptocurreny cash machine.
