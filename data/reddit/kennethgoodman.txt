Depends if any of the words are the same.
Second, question is ill formatted. Assuming the words are all unique, there are N=12! possibilities, and the probability of guessing the order in one guess is 1/12!, The probability of guessing the seed after n guesses is P(X&lt;=n)=n/N!. Probability of guessing in exacting n guesses = P(X=n)=1/N!. So the expected number of guesses = Sum(P(X=n)*n for n in range(N!)) = Sum( n/N! for n in range(N!)) = 1/N! * (1+2+...+N!) = 1/N! * (N! * (N!+1)/2) = (N!+1) / 2 -&gt; N!/2 as N grows large. 12! / 2 ~= 240M. By adding one word, 13!/2 ~= 3.1B, EV(X=14 words) = 43B

the 57B of trading volume is bulls and bears trading with each other stabilizing the price.
In the last 24 hours, BTC volume is ~4.5B USD (according to CMC). If I added 1.7% or ~75M into the market on the top exchanges: Binance (20M), BitFinex (20M), BitFlyer (15M), GDAX (15M) and Bitstamp (5M) the price on these would go up 20% immediately. Not including all the TA people: "Breaking through the resistance layer" and the momentum traders and short squeeze that would occur. 1.7% is more than enough to move the market &gt;20%. 
But, wait, tether only printed 39/365 days, so about 10% of the days. So in reality, if they traded the 39 printings over 3 days each time. Or on average 5% of trading volume when they traded. 
If they did that today, that would be ~225M, easily able to move the market themselves &gt;20%.

it is not adjusted every block, it is adjusted every 2016 blocks.
