If an asset is inflated by 10% per year, do you think ppl want to keep on holding it? 
If you think that this will make ppl spend their BTC then you will have to recognize that spending BTC also suppresses the price. Ppl could also sell their BTC for USD instead of buying stuff with it (if they dont need any ´"stuff" atm). It certainly doesn't create any additional demand. 
DPOS would make it possible for Bitcoin to pay interest instead of dilution coinholders.

Rather simple point with respect to crypto but a rich article in terms of money theory. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 09:05:33


in which sense?
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:26:01
There is just no need to create new bitcoin for transaction processing. Miners could be paid by tx fees instead of block reward.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:06:31
That was a level headed post. Nothing you say is wrong! It is also my assessment that three mining pools could not really reverse tx that lie back too long since miners would notice that the pool doesnt produce anything for themanymore, so the pool will loose his 51% after a while. How long? You could reverse tx with a few confirmations probably.
BUT... :) 
Centralization is not the biggest issue with POW. 
The biggest issue (which also was the main point in the video) is that it is super expensive to keep the costs high an attacker would have if he wanted to buy up and/or lease 51% of the hashing power. You can pay miners either by inflating the money/bitcoin supply as it currently is the case (25 btc per 10 minutes -&gt; 10% more bitcoins per year = 10% inflation) or you have no inflation and let miners be paid completely by transaction fees which, if the hashing power and therefore the security should stay the same, would be around 30 USD per transaction. BTSX has 1 cent atm.
Bitcoin would become profitable (and scalable (not discussed here)) if it adopts DPOS. Profitable in the sense that network security would not have to be paid by diluting bitcoin holders. 
The other big issue (not mentioned by the video) is that IF someone bought 51% of the hashing power it would take really long to fork since you would need to implement a new POW algorithm -&gt; permanent network failure. 
With DPOS you can just fork if someone has acquired 51% of the stake and not honor that holder in your fork and users would use this fork since the old network proved to be unreliable. That would work within hours.

in fact it doesnt have usd backing but people are willing to trade 1 usd for for 1 bitusd. Do your own research :) 
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:34:03
I didn't really read into this. Does someone know how NameID and the bitshares solution here are different?
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:47:59
Because the USD (and the EUR) are relatively stable (at the moment) and AT THE MOMENT serve as a better medium of exchange and measure of value than Bitcoin because Bitcoin is too volatile. 
But there is also BitGLD (pegged to the value of one ounce of gold)...
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:32:42


It is so simple: 25 new btcoins are created every 10 minutes (additionally to the btc already in existence) this means that the money supply of bitcoins increases (by 10% per year) which equals inflation. 
The argument in the video was simply to avoid the inflation and do Bitcoin holders a favor by not diluting their holding through inflation.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:20:31


They where distributed to PTS holder (a proof of work coin that could be mined for half a year) and to those who donated to the cause of creating DPOS (overall about 5million usd where donated as far as I remember).
It does not matter how efficient ASICS are to the argument that was made in the video. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 21:53:53
I read that. The author makes a good point. But it is not an issue. Why? See 
@_date: 2014-10-11 23:05:00
BitShares is the name of the overall project. 
BitSharesX has a blockchain that is seperate from the BitShares Music blockchain.
The units of account in BitSharesX is BTSX. The units of account in the BitShares Music chain are called Notes. 
You can buy Notes through the fundraiser. 
As for whether those are currencies 
@_date: 2014-11-18 08:59:49
Sure there are working alternatives already. NXT and BitShares use two forms of proof of stake that differ a bit from each other... It's not that long and under a high market cap tested like Bitcoin's POW but in theory it is magnitudes more efficient in terms of security per cost. 
The standard arguments that POS can't work are not valid, at least to a big degree. This  contains a very valid discussion about POW vs. (delegated) Proof of Stake, especially the conversation between arhag and vladzamfir.
Now I was interested whether the Counterparty team is looking at other alternatives that are not yet practically implemented. I would have been interested to read into those. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 01:26:29
Hello Gavin, 
did you read about DPOS (delegated proof of stake)? It does not have the nothing at stake concerns pointed out here  
The argument about nothing at stake can be found here 
General explanation of DPOS is here 
@_date: 2014-09-23 21:59:06


Shareholders vote. Delegates produce blocks. Non of these two groups can do both. They are separated in terms of what their functions in the system are. 
The argument about buying old private keys is not a thread for security. This post is addressing exactly the point made in the paper you linked: 
@_date: 2014-10-22 12:55:55
Thanks for the hint. But that is a very general logic principle. The question is whether it applies to this specific case. I would say no. Did you read the post about the nothing at stake concerns I quoted above?
@_date: 2014-10-02 11:26:51


Right. DPOS secures the public ledger solely by tx fees, no block reward. Part of those tx fees goes to those who secure the network and the another part (the miner part) goes to the holders of the currency. 
Bitcoin would greatly benefit from this  
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:22:21
Inflation does make holders either spend their coins or exchange them to fiat if there is nothing they want atm which can be purchased with BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:03:27
Only delegates (elected by stakeholders/shareholders) could create a fork. Those that would sign two blocks at a time will loose their delegate position or can even be fired automatically.  
Also a fork that prevails longer than 16 minutes would require the collusion of 52 delegates which is more than highly unlikely plus evident anyway.

It is not as much a chicken-egg problem as with a non price stable crypto currency since something those would require ~ world wide acceptance in order to reach price stability which would be necessary to adopt it....
Something like BitUSD is much more easy to bootstrap.

No counterparty risk in the sense that a central party could default on the collateral. Here is the whitepaper (incl. the risks): 
@_date: 2014-12-30 20:38:20
Conclusion: "All attempts at pegging a crypto-currency to a fiat currency are flawed if they violate the core principles of no price fixing, only voluntary trade, no socialized risk with centralized profits, and over 100% reserve backing." Read it :)

Not directly "interest" but...BitSharesX uses the concept of yields: The trading fees of the build in prediction market go to the holders of the Assets. And the transactions fees go partly to the holders of BTSX which is the token for BitSharesX (like bitcoins for Bitcoin). 
For example: The Asset BitBTC follows the value of Bitcoin (the better your predictions are about the future value relation of BTSX (BitSharesX currency) and Bitcoin the more money you make. If your predictions are false you loose money. The result of this prediction market is a crypto currency that is price pegged to BTC and the trading fees go the the holders of BTC. 
The same can be done with anything that has a well defined / measurable value, for example the Dow Jones Index or USD. BitUSD has the price stability of the dollar, pays a yield from transaction fees of the prediction market and has the properties of a crypto currency (you have the private keys not the bank, no middle men, low fees, fast (10 second block time in this case)).
This explained what the result and purpose is but I did not really explain how it works. See here for more info  
The whole thing went live a little more than a month ago and works decently by now.
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:46:42
Getting payed by the blockchain (stakeholders) (like it is soon possible with BitShares) is an experimental field but one of the most exiting. It certainly wouldn't mean that you would get paid less than if you work for USD. 
I would read into the most prominent Bitcoin 2.0 projects and decide which you think has the most potential. This ensures that you are enthusiastic about the project you contribute to. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:46:10
You need to trust the market mechanics but you do not need to trust a single individual or company to be honest. 
The market mechanics (if they work right which they did for a few month now) force all traders to trade close to the peg of 1 bitusd = usd. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:22:39
Proof of burn is not a method to secure a blockchain (ensure the unity of the ledger)...but a method to allocate the coins initially.
So you did not look into any alternatives to POW yet seriously? 
@_date: 2014-10-01 18:52:58


IF Bitcoin is best described as a currency :) 
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:38:10
Great project! Two related questions: 
1) Which are the most interesting alternative algorithms besides proof of work you have seen/analyzed?
2) I am making the following assumption: In the long run proof of work will be too expensive to power a blockchain (given that there are alternatives) and in the long run the market will adapt to it which will weaken the Bitcoin security.
So, in the long run, do you see more potential in side chains or moving your platform to another blockchain? Would the side chains option effect the value proposition of xcp in any way?
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:27:04
I think that this is not the end of Bitcoin. The enthusiasm and the prospects are too great and speculation by traders always overrule long term challenges like the mining challenge described here which will already be only half as problematic with the next block reward halving. 
Many also will buy again in these price regions just because many sold when they saw a price peak a year ago just in order to buy again when the price is sufficiently low. 
All that said I think we are all well advised to look at the long term dynamics of what has been invented in 2008. If done right Bitcoin has the potential to make society more transparent and accountable without the need for a government to force accountability on us. There has been a great article on future prospects where this might all go  Not saying that this development will replace Bitcoin but it seems worth investigating since basic technological breakthroughs  (Blockchain technology) are rarely only used for one use case (Bitcoin). 
On the topic of the OP: There has been an interesting in depth analysis of the matter at the Las Vegas Bitcoin Conference in October 14.  I don't agree entirely but has a lot of relevant points!
Counterparty is also worth a look too. They try to facilitate stock trading via the Bitcoin blockchain: Overstock.com will issue their stock on the Bitcoin blockchain sometimes next. So there is a lot of prospect in that too for Bitcoin, many are not aware of really.
