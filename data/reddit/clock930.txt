Not everyone does, this is a zero sum game. Every time time you make money someone else loses the same amount. The objective of big players/whales is to zero it in their favor.

This Forbes *blog post* is just the original news forcefully re-written to look good. It is just like China, news from Korea will keep coming with everyone in denial until all those exchanges are effectively closed and only then most of you will believe.  
Creation of new accounts is already banned while regulators review closing all exchanges.(their own words)

Bitfinex is now accepting Bitcoin Cash deposits, requires 15 confirmations. Selling before it is worth $1 or less. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:12:02
The reference client of Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin ABC. bitcoinabc.org It has nothing to do with BU.


It is mostly about money really. But i don't know what the game is, this is some shaddy stuff. For the developers it is not, they started the project when Bitcoin Classic was around, they wanted to fork anyway regardless of hash power and did the thing on their own without receiving any attention or support until it was finished.


This is no attack, people are free to use the equipment they own to mine whatever they want.
But there is hostility and large disagreement among individuals from all sides and that is is killing Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core got unusable, Bitcoin Cash is usable but full of shaddy people around. I got into Bitcoin in the early days but i don't use it anymore. The whole scenario got insane and destructive.

You are never coerced, you can opt to use other real nodes(miners) with different consensus rules or something else.

@_date: 2017-09-15 09:16:11
This is very misleading.
A network node that you refer as "full node" can't reject anything, other nodes/miners will broadcast it and mining nodes are the only ones that actually reject or do not reject a tx. The only reason to run a node that does not mine is to have extra security, i.e. you are a big business accepting bitcoin directly. 


Again miners do validate but i know what i mean. However from your point of view it is still misleading, an economy *produces* something. Those zombie nodes do not produce anything and so are worthless.

It is estimated that BIP148 will have at least more than 40% of the hash power. BIP91/Segwit2x is smoke and mirrors.
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:34:19
This is smoke to keep the price bubble going on for the longest possible so that miners can sell at high. The Network will fork to BIP148 and ABC, Bitmain made it clear that if BIP148 is for real they will hard fork to Bitcoin ABC as a contingency plan. Is not BIP148 for real? Will Core and we all just give up? Of course BIP148 is for real. There won't be any Segwit2x. 
Even Jeff Garzik is not confident and commented we may see no Segwit2x but instead a split between BIP148 and Bitcoin ABC.
Bitmain is doing a fake BIP91(Segwit2x) signaling, it is lacking the Segwit bit. See block "version", version ends in 0, not 2. 2 is the Segwit bit.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:47:05
Bitmain's pools are all improperly signaling for Segwit2x, it is possible that Segwit2x never gets activated.
My analysis is that Bitmain is waiting 1 august to activate Segwit2x because of this link below and so we may never see Segwit2x, but instead a contentious fork of BIP148 and Bitcoin ABC. 
Jeff Garzik is also considering that possibility himself. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:35:57
What if he also hacked Bitfinex?
@_date: 2017-07-18 09:16:25


And Bitmain which is suspected to own or have very close ties to ViaBTC is fake signaling, if Bitmain does not change their current block version they will orphan all sw2x blocks. Bitmain and their pools like Antpool and BTC.top are the only ones fake signaling. Some minor pools are not even signaling. 
**When will 336 block window end exactly?**
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:00:32
You are wrong, the Signaling section of the code says that it is both.
Still anything other than 0x20000012 does not enforce anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:37:25
Yes, block version must be 0x20000012
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:40:53


That's exactly because there is nothing speculative in what they(Core) do, they do what they believe. They believe in Segwit 1mb and they also believe that consensus is 100% hence the 95% threshold. And we used to have 100% consensus on everything, it is the first time it is not happening. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:12:11
They need to signal bit 1 too to enforce Sw2x, as far as i know all miners are signaling on both bits except Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:57:51
With enforcing i mean accepting sw2x blocks and rejecting non sw blocks. You must signal both bits to keep yourself in the sw2x chain once it is activated. This is basic, i don't know why you are so nervous. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:04:45
It should stay below 75%, it takes about 24 hours to adjust correctly. It is also likely to be seem as a breach of agreement and could trigger others to stop signaling. Looking like HK 2.0
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:27:22
BU is compatible with ABC. nChain just announced support to BU including its development.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:37:27
They did not say that, they twitted about a network failure already fixed. They keep mining without Segwit2x signaling.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:38:21
Look for the SW2X tag in the list of blocks "block version"
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:35:40


How not? He is the owner or share holder of most of those companies! Including some mining companies. See DCG website and get informed on what he owns, the list is huge and not complete 'cause as an individual he owns even more including a share of virtually all Bitcoin Exchanges around the globe.
And when it comes to overall miners, you don't really know what to expect until it is factual.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:45:50


@_date: 2017-07-19 10:42:43
Bitcoin.com also stopped signalling SW2X 
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:28:24
Signaling on bit 4 does not enforce anything when consensus and activation block is reached, it has has ho practical effect. Symbolic.
@_date: 2017-07-18 01:37:36
I don't know, everyone is keeping whatever they were signaling before in the *coinbase* . The coinbase is a symbolic signal of support, the block version is actual support of the system but Bitmain is using a block version that means SW2X without Segwit. SW and SW2X signal is the same at bit 1 so to differentiate each other they added a signal at bit 4. Bitmain is only using the bit 4 which is as symbolic as something in the coinbase, it won't cause a fork by signaling that incomplete block version. I believe they will never properly signal, they will wait BIP148 and hard fork to ABC, just speculation, i don't know their plan. SW2X was planned by Barry Silbert, the biggest bitcoin trader insider and it should tell you something.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:16:31


*Everyone is* signaling on both bit 4 and bit 1. Those who are not enforcing on bit 1 too are not even signaling for Segwit2x.
Bit 4 and bit 1(Segwit2x): 
* BitFury 
* BitClub:  
* BixIn: 
* BTCC: 
Bit 1 only (Segwit):
* F2Pool: 
* Slush: 
No bit 4 and no bit 1 (current bitcoin):
* Kano CKPool: 
Bit 4 only:
* ViaBTC (ties with Bitmain): 
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:41:14
I don't have much of an opinion about it but the 100% consensus seems legit and not helpful to themselves.
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:48:51
Surely it is much netter, actually in this case it is not a matter of being better but a matter of being rational.

Yes, BIP148 is better. BIP91 is a speculative technical Frankenstein. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:06:44
They were supporting BIP148 before the nya.
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:47:52
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:07:16
They are are actually signing Segwit2x without Segwit. False signaling that does not enforce anything when consensus is reached.
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:28:24
Bitfury also stopped signaling for Segwit2x. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:43:55
It is impossible to trust miners, look at the mined blocks instead. For now it is still not sw2x. Bitfury stopped signaling and is completely silent about it, what they would say would not matter anyway. I'm watching the blocks. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:06:57
BitFury did stop sw2x too.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:32:02


You are the one not understating, they are signaling 2x and enforcing Segwit at the same time so that they are ready when it is time. There is no need to enforce it right now, sure, but there is also no need to not too, and everyone is enforcing.
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:34:01
It is Segwit2x with the additional signaling at bit 4 and 80% threshold, the 2MB part does not have a BIP of its own.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:09:31
This site is getting it somewhat wrong. They are are actually signaling Segwit2x without Segwit. False signaling that does not enforce anything when consensus is reached.
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:00:58
That's old strategy. You buy the asset and when you want to sell you start promoting analysis as a specialist investment bank or something like this. The herd will buy while you are selling.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:43:20
And Bitmain not using bit 1...
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:41:39


Invalid argument.  BIP91/SW2X are a few big businesses commanded by Barry Silbert forking themselves off the network. 


It will happen, it is happening already just not activated yet. It will be activated 1 august.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:40:40
It is lacking the Segwit bit, completely fake.
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:26:16
That is what i thought and believe, the FBI or Thai police stole at least a big part of the coins and killed him.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:07:56
Bitfury and Bitcoin.com stopped signaling Segwit2x, it is going to get less than 80%.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:35:40
Old and non relevant anymore. By the way their chart was wrong the whole time, it does not matter if got to any price point they pointed because it was already wrong before.
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:40:35
Big blocks are bad for some, i get it. Segwit is bad for some, i get it. Segwit2x is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the best of the two because they are simply non compatible, complete non sense. A true Frankenstein, must be a joke.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:11:52
They announced Bitcoin ABC mining and said nothing about SW2X.
They had nothing or little to lose experimenting with an alt coin, Bitcoin is a different history. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:50:46
SW2X agreement was planned by the biggest speculator and insider in Bitcoin trading: Barry Silbert. He and other whales have been playing pump and dump since we first reached the 2.8k price more than a month ago, this time won't be different. Only inexperienced traders are falling for it *again*. Expect a dump or major price drop soon.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:03:42


And more delay. With bugs appearing often we may see BIP148 before sw2x which would be nice.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:31:10


What you said is not wrong, can be done that way. But as i said Bitmain is the only one i know of not enforcing on bit 1 and look at it:

The history is much older, it is going on since Satoshi made the public release of the whitepaper. In the first day it was already being questioned.
@_date: 2017-06-25 11:25:48
 I do support BIP148 but does it have significant mining support in case of a network split?
