I'll remember it for next time. I still wanted to buy before the Big Bang episode, and I'll probably buy more before Christmas because I'm sure it'll hit new ATH around then

Very new to bitcoin, so I wanted to properly research before I bought anything (and possibly mess up in the process). That and all the talk of a "dip" had me convinced to wait a bit more until I just couldn't lol. It's a fair question..should've would've could've, but now I'm hodling!

I almost pulled the trigger today on a few, but I have to be responsible and buy when I can and what I'm prepared to lose.

Worst case I buy more if it falls :)

@_date: 2017-11-29 06:28:37
There is for sure fomo but also I want to be a apart of the excitement finally 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:32:18
Haha thanks for the encouragement! I believe it too for all of us, it's only the beginning
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:27:23
I won't but man the ATH keeps changing so how can you ever know?
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:17:06
Man if I had any idea on how to do that lol, I am not that computer savvy
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:49:24
Where did you switch over to?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:52:04
Yeah I know, but it's not something I can't lose ATM with my situation. That's the best advice I've seen on reddit so I'm sticking to it.
