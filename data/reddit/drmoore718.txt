This is the correct answer, assuming bitcoin survives long term, but only because OP did not give a time frame. Since bitcoin is deflationary and USD is inflationary, you could argue that the exchange rate will reach any value given a long enough period of time.

edit: and this type of transaction is just begging for schnorr

The FAQ covers this.

It was 3.0.3, but like I said, opening it first on mainnet then testnet was a workaround for the error.  I'm going to give core a try today because electrum defaulted to segwit addresses and I couldn't find any faucets that would send to them.

I suppose now would be a good time to introduce the bot I have been working on.  It's lightly tested, so let me know if you have any issues!
Also it will need some upvotes in this sub to prevent reddit's throttling.

I had a problem with electrum saying "Failed to execute script electrum" or something like that.  After opening electrum without the --testnet parameter, they trying testnet again, it worked.

Would it work behind a load balancer?  Say I want to run three instances so that I can bring one down at a time to update to the latest while maintaining 100% uptime, would an invoice given to a customer by the host that was taken down to be updated still work while that host is down?

I never said arbitrage trading is being parasites. Please think before you post.

No, but arbitrage is.

My node was down for a few hours today, sorry about that!
As for your previous failures, it looks like you're running a private node so I can't queryroutes to investigate.  Can you make sure one of your channels has enough remote balance?
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:54:51
Thanks for all the work getting this out!

This is true, but when you opened a channel from eclair to your large node, it likely had those large fees. When you tried to route a payment from eclair, it may have rejected it due to large fees on the only path it found

Someone, probably an exchange, is consolidating outputs with 1 sat/vbyte transactions like this one.
There is an overall reduction of the utxo set, which is a good thing.

Bitcoin nodes 
@_date: 2018-07-12 04:54:05
I think this should be possible, you just need to find a node willing to open a channel with you.  If you expect to get payments for some reason, there would be some incentive to do so as they'd be able to collect some routing fees for each payment sent your way.

Hey guys, bot creator here hijacking the top comment.  First of all, really appreciate everyone taking an interest in the bot and LN in general!  Unfortunately, it looks like my LN node went down yesterday and I'm out of town for the holidays so I won't be able to bring it back up for a few days.  In the meantime, tips with existing balances should work fine, but deposits and withdrawals will be unavailable until I get the node back up.  I'll keep updates over here:

Thanks everyone for using the bot!  It has gotten quite a bit more usage in the recent days, so bear with me as I fix any issues that pop up.
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:23:07
I had a similar problem and while I never did find what was causing it, I was able to fix the problem by putting the Blockchain on a different hard drive. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 05:54:18
Thanks for the kind words!
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:22:23
I had a very similar problem - I ended up fixing it by pointing the client to a different hard drive for the blockchain and re-downloading it.  I have no idea why the corruption was happening on one of my hard drives but not the other.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:33:40
I tried, but it keeps getting corrupted then ends up hanging bitcoin-qt when I open it.  I have had nothing but problems trying to run a full node :(
