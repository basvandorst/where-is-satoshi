When Mt. Gox crashed the price was around 1000 dollars, right now anyone getting their coins back from Mt. Gox has made a hypothetical 6x their original investment when they finally get their money. If you made 6x your money right now would you take profits or let it sit and be paranoid you would lose that money again. Most likely you would take some of that 6x profit. This means that there is now a flood of supply trying its best to get as close to what the price is right now.
However, as a buyer, knowing that those people taking profits originally bought in at 1000, do you think it is fair for those people to ask to sell for 6k when those coins they are selling originally were worth 1k? Most likely you would answer no, thus you would ask for them to sell for lower since there is a 6x wiggle room in which those people selling would still be making profits and willing to sell at.
Anyone getting their money back from Mt. Gox is totally okay to sell anywhere between 1k and 6k because they would still be profiting off any price in that range. Buyers want the lowest price so they will try and push price to the lowest part of that range: aka 1000 dollars. Will it fall all the way to 1k, most likely no because sellers will put pressure on a specific resistance level (maybe all Mt. Gox people really want to make sure they get at least 2x profits and no one goes lower etc.)
