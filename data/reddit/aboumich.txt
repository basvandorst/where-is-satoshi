The canadian senate had a committee on Bitcoin. Here is the Report. 
 
EDIT: Quote from the conclusion "After hearing from a broad range of witnesses in Ottawa, and traveling to New York City for a factfinding
trip, the Committee has concluded that digital currencies and their technologies present a
variety of opportunities. In the Committee’s view, it is likely that the innovation underlying these
currencies and technologies has applications that have not yet been imagined. There is evidence
that they reduce transaction costs, increase the choices available to customers and merchants,
protect users’ identities and record all transactions. A key focus, then, is the actions that the federal
government and other entities could take to maximize those opportunities."
