Lost just over $200k.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:05:40
Not enough.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:33:03
I really, really hope they don't turn into another Kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:31:48
I think it's your terminology that is throwing me off. When you say "sold" your bitcoins into your EUR wallet, do you really mean to say transfer? Because you can't simply withdraw BTC into your bank account. Did you sell it on the exchange already? In other words, is it now EUR fiat? That might explain why you are having a difficult time trying to take your money out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:48:21
Nope. Better to follow the advice of internet strangers I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:53:35
And when it moons, I will buy 10 girlfriends. And a Lambo.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:57:21
There are two. Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) launches on the 10th.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:36:20
Good on you. I plan on keeping mine so that my future son or daughter won't have to.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:59:15
As someone who is not really familiar with futures, how would this be possible? I mean what are ways they could actually game the system?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:49:02
That was not your question, but I'll try to answer your new one the best I can. First of all, yes I have bought and sold BTC on the GDAX exchange. No, I have never "sold my bitcoins" on Coinbase as my understanding is you only buy from there. Selling is done on the exchange. If you are referring to withdrawing into my fiat account, then yes I have done that as well. So yes, it works.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:02:11
Spiking now!
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:49:44
Yes it usually takes a while to receive funds in your bank. The bank takes time to process, it is not the fault of Coinbase. Especially since we have the weekend coming up, it will take longer. Be patient.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:44:35
There is nothing to analyze. He is telling you to follow your gut. Your own words man.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:40:27
10 pounds lighter.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:59:46
Cool story, bro. Now go beg somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:11:41
Oh God. Not this again. Don't do it, unless you don't mind potentially losing everything.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:15:28
Consider it an heirloom.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:34:50
No I believe they get back the difference. Lost $200k+ though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:34:47
Guys, give the man a break. We are talking about a thousandnaire here. What's it like up there?
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:16:08
How can you say that when it is ALREADY affecting the price? The futures market is supposed to use the existing market to determine their contracts. Problem is it can be easily manipulated and people will also look towards the futures market to make their trading decisions even though it should be the other way around. Prices will definitely be affected. How much so, that is yet to be seen.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:38:28
You know, the more I think about this, the more I have a feeling that BTC itself was never meant to be used as a day-to-day currency. Maybe whoever created Bitcoin, regardless of what they said, anticipated the creation of all these other coins as a result. So in that sense, Bitcoin did bring about the change, but not in such a straightforward sense. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:47:06
Futures could potentially make BTC drop even more. Nobody knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:51:49
Downvoted because you don't agree or because of something you don't want to hear?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:33:07
I try to give all news, good or bad, the benefit of a doubt. But this is clearly FUD. Check your sources people.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:41:08
I use their GDAX platform and never had any problems so far.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:05:30
Most people here didn't get the joke. I got it because I've read it at least a dozen times already on this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:59:27
So rather than hold a healthy discussion or debate, just downvote. Right on. Here is a slow clap for you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:52:48
I used to have a girlfriend. Now I just have crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:32:27
I don't think you actually understand what HODL means.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:09:15
I agree. Paying the electrical bill would be the only fair solution.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:00:09
You might get your coins by New Year.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:36:45
BRO ... maybe you don't get it. Why do you think there was a spike to almost $20k the other day? And then the dip today, less than 24 hours before the futures launch? People have been trying to put the chess pieces into play for some time now. They're not waiting until the actual launch to get things started. If you don't understand the concept of market manipulation, then you're in the wrong game. The get quick rich idiots weren't the ones buying coins in bulk, but they are the ones selling right now. Selling because now they are hearing "news" and rumors that the futures launch will crash the market, etc. That's what I mean when I say the whole futures thing is affecting price already. If you're talking about AFTER the launch, then I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:55:48
Fair enough. The way I understand it is HODLing is a long term strategy / philosophy. Yes, they will not sell even during large dips or even crashes. In fact, many will even buy during these times to accumulate more. The key point is however, they won't even sell during massive rises, even with the potential for returns. HODLers simply let their coins sit until ... I dunno ... the moon I guess? But I got into all of this late in the game, so I'm definitely no authority on this matter.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:07:37
No, we should invest in our 401k instead. This way when we are 65 and are no longer wanted in the workforce (retirement), we will have that and Social Security. Oh wait. Darn.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:41:31
People like to throw around the phrase "fake news" because that's the trendy thing to do these days.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:33:24
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:38:50
That alone doesn't make them a scam. Throwing baseless accusations is very bad taste.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:08:49
Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Sorry but Kraken has to be one of the worst.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:37:23
I got so fed up with them that I converted all my USD into ETH and transferred it the hell out of there rather than have to deal with their website issues that prevented me from even withdrawing my money. Crooks? I don't know. Completely incompetent? Perhaps.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:01:38
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:54:33
Exactly. I understand everyone has their passion and beliefs, but we must think before we act, and not let our emotions get the better of us. I know, it's not always easy.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:47:01
A co-worker of mine bought a used car with Bitcoin back in the day. I mean entire, whole Bitcoins. He never said exactly how much, but just take comfort in knowing that you are not the only one, and there are MANY people who did the same thing. Hindsight is always 20/20.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:21:21
Here we go. I think it might be happening now.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:47:10
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:42:50
And ... now I want Taco Bell.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:04:44
Also the fact that Ether is unlimited and can be produced ad infinitum.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:39:46
It just forwarded me to shapeshift.io website. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:41:13
That ... that's not how it works. These are valid concerns held by many people, and if the general public fail to adopt the technology because of all the confusion and drama that exists now, it will only hurt ALL crytos. At the very least, the damage will hinder progress and prevent the tech from reaching its full potential.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:39:30
I can see this turning into a violent confrontation. It's one thing to be a keyboard warrior and fight with words, but it will get ugly if this type of behavior spills onto the streets. I'm not taking sides here, I'm just saying be careful.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:00:32
Over $7240 now. This HAS to be a pump and dump. I'm just waiting for it to DROP ... so that I can buy some. :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:00:59
Whoa. I literally pulled everything out yesterday. I had a feeling things were going downhill for them.
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:04:38
When is this dude going to finish writing his books?
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:36:26
Cringy on so many levels.
@_date: 2019-01-12 08:10:14
BITCONNEEEECT!
