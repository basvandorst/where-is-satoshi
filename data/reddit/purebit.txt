We URGENTLY need on-chain scaling and we need it yesterday. This can kick the can down the road ~2-3 years until we have layer 2 solutions.
I am seriously afraid that otherwise a more agile altcoin will take over.

Is there a way to run a node without verifying/downloading more than the last few days?
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:16:47
Median is also pulled up by spam transactions with too small fee. 
More useful data would be a chart of the average fees of confirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:46:22
It is ok to run bitcoin with a small number of nodes.
In case of an attempt to censor bitcoin, the community would very quickly add additional nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:44:06
Having more diversity in terms of clients would be good for Bitcoin. It makes Bitcoin more resistant to bugs. It would be nice for BU to get more professional development support.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:31:04
...and think about all the other fun things you could do if you can predict the future!

In what sense is LTC a scam?
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:13:43
We need a compromise and people talking to each other.
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:13:22
Yes, I know. But we need a serious compromise and unite the community to move on.
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:00:24
segwit is blocking BU!!1 /s
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:30:42
We are only talking about an attack on the nodes. So the miners (who should have the full blockchain) would never confirm a transaction of someone who falsely pretends to have 5 bitcoin from 2008.
The task of the community during an attack on the nodes should only be to make sure that correct blocks (that are mined after the attack on the nodes) can propagate.
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:06:04
Signing a transaction does not expose your private key.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:44:33
In order to fight back an attack it would be fine to run a pruned node. CPU time and bandwidth wouldn't be a problem since nobody could afford to run a dedicated attack for a  long time.
It is not easy to bring down a p2p network. I am not running a node right now, but I would run one to defend bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:25:05
A critical DOS bug in core would imply no blocks until the problem is fixed. -&gt; loss of trust in bitcoin.
Having a second independent implementation (50% miners) without the bug would lead to a doubled block time until fixed. -&gt; less bad
Your argument that a common effort is more successful is only true if the total number of developers does not increase with a second implementation.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:30:33
Data caps might be a thing in the US. But you just need to run extra nodes as long as the network is under attack.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:42:25
I am pretty sure there are more than 100 Million people with internet connection that could support 10 MB blocks.
In case a government would attack the network via too few full nodes, the community could easily fight back by setting up new nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:18:25
Would there be a way to avoid downloading and verifying the whole chain? One could just start downloading and verifying starting from the time when the attack started.
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:40:04
Currently half of the economy thinks that the price will go up and the other half that the price will go down.
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:43:34
Many people including me believe that low throughput and high fees are a very real problem.
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:07:34
You could always independently check with a trusted person of your choice to confirm the attack (and get the missing blocks). If you do not trust Roger Ver, you could ask Greg Maxwell.
And given a nation state attack on bitcoin they might even agree with each other ;).
Distribution could be through conventional file-sharing. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:20:21
This is why you could start verifying just before the attack.
Currently most people use thin clients, which is perfectly fine as long the network is not under attack.
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:01:16
In general I agree. But I would sacrifice a small amount of trustlessness to end the stalemate of the current bitcoin scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:32:11
Open source P2P networks are hard to attack. Bittorrent has not been shut down by the music industry either.
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:17:36


Bitcoin is 8 years old. Most new technologies saturated the market much faster.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:49:34
Even many Core developers say that we need bigger blocks in the future. With the NY agreement it is the ideal time to get this done WITH support from miners and WITH support from exchanges.
In my opinion a risky hardfork with consensus is worth much more than delaying the problem further.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:30:07
Negative side effects:
1) Money locked away in payment channels.
2) Easy for governments to control since they can force "kraken" to reveal transaction information and customer information. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:29:53
Thanks for the explanation!
I guess there might be an attack vector if someone intercepts the double-spend on one chain before my transaction propagates on the second chain?
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:45:15
Yes, that's what I mean. And even this will just buy us 2 years max to come up with better scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:43:04
Is your node mining or running an exchange?
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:14:29
It would just require one "good" person that detects the attack and mobilises everyone else. The goal is only to keep the correct blocks propagating. The few blocks between start of attack and mobilisation of users could be easily distributed by other means.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:43:44
Asicboost will not work anymore with Segwit2x. It would require making changes to the Segwit code to keep Asicboost running. I have not heard of any plans to make such changes.

Most people live in countries without data caps
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:19:00
Do your own research on how bitcoin works. Blindly following other people is never a good idea.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:29:41
The whole of Europe and most of developed Asia including China has no data caps. 
Data caps are a thing only in the US and Canada. The rest of the world abandoned them already 10 years ago. Even Australia has internet without data caps now.
Couldn't find a useful statistic about this. Feel free to check for broadband ISPs in a country of your choice if you don't believe it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:44:44
Is there a replay protection in case of a chain split?
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:47:51
Sorry for starting the confusion between chains and transactions.
I believe my point remains valid. Say you do your double spend on two chains M and N. There is no way of actually doing this 100% simultaneously. A well connected node on chain M could see your first transaction and immediately start a replay attack on chain N. Asumming the attacker has very good connection to chain N, the replay attack transaction could propagate faster than  your own transaction on chain N.
This is all assuming reaction times of the attacker at the millisecond level, which might not be  practical.
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:28:05
I see the UASF as a nice stress test for bitcoin. Hopefully the outcome will show that PoW doesn't care about politics and disinformation.
@_date: 2017-06-02 07:24:54
Sweeping your wallets will not reduce the total amount of fees you are paying.
And sweeping only at times of low fees is not user friendly.
Currently it just doesn't make economical sense to use bitcoin for small transactions. Unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:37:23
In order to scale transaction throughput with the lightning network I need to be able to reach an arbitrary other node through LN. This only works realistically if every node has more than 2 payment channels open simultaneously. I cannot follow you how this would work if you just open payment channels while transacting.
Anyway, this discussion is dead and two days too late.
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:27:09
Thanks for the nice explanation of splitting the coins!
However, your transaction would not necessarily propagate simultaneously on chain B and C. Hypothetically, if you send your transaction to an evil node on chain B, this node could instantly send a replay attack transaction to chain C. Assuming it is better connected on chain C, the malicious transaction would propagate faster on chain C than your double spend transaction on chain C.
I assume this would require a lot of network control, but might be feasible. Please correct me if I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:02:55
That is a strange understanding of bitcoin. How can miners make proposals? 
Bitcoin's strength is that miners can chose to run any software they want. 
Apparently there has been no software upgrade around that miners wanted to run.
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:57:22
They are afraid of network centralization with bigger blocks. However, the thing to worry about is mining cetralization (which actually looks more decentralized now than a few years ago).
We should go to 10 MB blocks now. When blocks will be full again after a year people will realize that increasing blocksize is not a sustainable scaling approach.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:31:28
Even the Wikipedia article on data caps just talks about the US. Searching for customer complaints also just brings up US results mostly from Comcast. 
I am sorry that you live in a third-world-Internet country. But it is naive to assume it is the same everywhere else.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:37:17
This would be only true if you live only using bitcoin. For any realistic usecase that involves conversion to fiat, bitcoin doesn't make sense for remittance.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:03:48


What a pointless comment. You are smart enough to know why this will not happen. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:53:50


... which would severely undermine the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin, since governments could request transaction details + user information from bank A and bank B.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:54:32
1) I cannot think of a realistic scenario in which you would open a payment channel just during transacting. That would require to accumulate a list of debts/credits first (based on some kind of trust).
2) "kraken" knows that Bob paid Alice (KYC laws + "kraken" is participant of both lightning channels). And with lots of fee pressure only big companies like "kraken" could afford payment channels. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:37:33


Would be happy to see some evidence beyond conspiracy theories of all Chinese miners being controlled by Jihan.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:58:27
The obvious answer is that it currently doesn't make economic sense for merchants to accept bitcoin.
I can come up with the following reasons:
1) It requires a lot of customer support (people pay the wrong fee, transaction doesn't confirm,...)
2) Not enough interested customers (missing customer protection)
3) Problems with volatility of price (how to process refunds?)
Please feel free to add reasons.
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:45:59
...and in order to make bitcoin scale back to useful levels we need Segwit + lightning + bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:40:04


So an attacker would have a few seconds to do a replay attack on the second chain (assuming the propagation takes a few seconds longer on the second chain). He needs to be a bit lucky that his transaction is mined and not mine (but he could achieve this by a better connectivity to the network; similar to transaction malleability).
But I don't understand the details of a replay attack well enough to know whether this would be feasible.
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:52:27
quote Garzik: 
"The WG agreed to "segwit AND 2M", and that what we are focused on delivering. To the extent that current segwit disables asicboost, or not, that remains unchanged and unmodified.
This issue asks the question, therefore, do additional changes need to be added, to further ban/disable/render inert asicboost."

This has been a result of the infighting and stagnation in bitcoin. The blame goes to everyone not willing to compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:04:18
Here is one of Luke Jr's strawpolls about blocksize increase showing more than 60% approval for an increase this year:
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:52:29


Great idea, how about supporting segwit2x?! That would destroy jihan's incentive to block segwit and destroy asicboost and has economic majority behind and has 80% hashpower support! 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:01:01
1) The coins will just be ready when you close the channel, which costs fees.
2) What prevents "kraken" from knowing about the transaction if it goes through their two separate channels with Alice and Bob?
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:50:20
The NY agreement seems less unacceptable than segwit alone. Especially taking into account support from exchanges and hashpower.
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:48:07


1) The supply will still be limited by economical costs of storage. Just not by an arbitrary defined limit.
2) Blocks are only full since last year. Before that there was plenty unused blockspace that didn't influence the security of bitcoin.
3) There are still many years of block rewards in bitcoin.
