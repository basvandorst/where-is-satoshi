They'll waste and mismanage that money too.

Yes you do. Damn anyone who disagrees.

Yeah, and no matter where you rent, you'll definitely not get any of it back. Each rent check is gone forever and you get another single *month* to show for it.
With a mortgage, you might not get a dime back due to a disaster in your specific market, but that's extremely rare. However, mortgages are almost always a few hundred less than what rent would be for that same location and size. 
And who said you have to live there for 30 or more years? Rent it out and pay your monthly payments with the rent you collect. You can even borrow against your equity to improve the property or whatever.
Anyone who thinks renting is frugal, isn't thinking clearly.

Pay them sure, but why be happy about it? That's *your* money.

 Until the power goes out. Or government controls the internet. Or technology makes a huge and wild leap.

 Internet wasn't scary. It was the coolest thing ever.

I know how it works. I trade my dollars for goods and services. Everyone respects it, and the most powerful country in the world backs it.

No one can explain what it is. It's numbers? Cool. I'm not a computer scientist.

What mathematics? Not everyone understands that shit.

Although bitcoin is total bullshit, remember that yes you can fight it. Turning over is not a winning attitude.
