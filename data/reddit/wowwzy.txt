More precisely speculating. The entire premise is that it will become more valuable with time, by design. Once they take it as a given, there's no more reasoning and everything becomes rationalizing and making reality fit your theory.

Hard to tell.
Gold used to be in the 300s for a long time in the 90s and early 2000s. Then India and China grew exponentially, population exploded in the muslim world. All those regions are fond of gold as a status symbol plus their recent brushes with either poverty or corruption pushes them to seek a safety of some kind. 
Then the financial crisis scared a ton of people who then looked for safety in Gold, especially physical gold. 
All of this made gold 4 times more expensive. It is mostly psychological, I think, but it is ingrained in the human experience. Gold as a measure of wealth is almost in our collective DNA and another valid-yet-less-tangible medium will have a very hard time getting a similar status.
People used to sail across the world to dig for gold. Cities, regions, countries were created or colonized for gold. Even if it just one shiny metal, it's not ANY shiny metal for us humans.

Then the rationale is that the tulip craze was irrational because supply was virtually unlimited long term but the bitcoin craze is justified because of the limited supply?
This might be a rational explanation on the surface, but the underlying issue with both was that speculators gave an unrealistic expectation of where the market was going. If everyone believes it can only go up, regardless of what you can actually do with either a tulip bulb or a bitcoin, then people will hodl and others will want to buy.
Now the question remains what can be done with bitcoins. 
Speed of transactions is an issue. Existing monopolies of fiat are an issue. Hackers are an issue. Volatility scaring brick-and-mortar business acceptance is an issue.
One single decision can kill bitcoins: if the US government mandates all holders of more than a certain amount of bitcoins to be fully identified and declare their trades/holdings in their tax returns, and if the exchanges are forced to disclose IDs of traders/holders else they shut down the FDIC coverage for USD deposits and rights to do any transfer whatsoever. This would cut off the connection Bitcoin-USD which would make it impossible to value. Then it will go back to be a currency for the parallel economy.

There is no definite answer to that one.
Bubble pops tend to overshoot fair value. 
Take a house in Modesto built during the 2006 bubble. You could sell it for 450K when construction costs would be 250 to 300K. Then in 2009 that same house would sell for 150K, almost 1/3 of peak value and 1/2 of replacement value.
The potential for Bitcoin hasn't been met yet. Maybe there's none. Maybe it's the moon. As long as we do not see Bitcoins outside of the current speculative territory, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value except the result of irrational exhuberance. 
It aims to replaces a strong and proven medium that is 240 years old and that came after 2000 years of physical currency. Tough job. It could ad efficiencies though that's not proven IRL yet.

Interestingly enough, Keynes thought we would be working less than 20 hours a week today, due to automation. But gains in productivity were not shared, either in cash or free time. They were hogged through less tax capture. Marginal tax rates have been halved since the 50s. Taxation is how the capitalist balancing of incomes was supposed to happen. Yet investors and entrepreneurs get to keep more of that money while the rest keep working their regular 40-hour weeks.

As long as everyone gets paid, nobody will go against a bubble.
That's a lesson of the 2006 bubble.
- The government loved the new growth from refis and homebuilding
- The bankers loved the increasing business
- The investors loved the safe returns of mortgage bonds
- Wall Street loved the MBSs especially the high yield ones on risky mortgages
- The mortgage brokers loved the commissions
- The Realtors loved the 5%
- The Buyers loved the "guaranteed" returns from a leveraged asset
- The Sellers loved the cash
- The Regular Homeowners loved to be able to refi and extract **their** money from their house to pay for stuff
It took a tiny rate increase in June 2006 to send all of this crashing.
I went to Florida in the spring of 2006 to look for property (Naples, Venice, Sarasota, FMB). The prices I saw there were pretty affordable for someone from California, but then I looked at the local economy. The jobs, the paychecks, the rents. Florida was more than double what I would have accepted to pay. In 2010 I did my shopping, but there was no need to go to Florida, since California had crashed too.
In the next 2 to 3 years I am staying put. Keeping my cash and ready to pounce when the next GR hits.
But Bitcoin? I see no mainstream use for it. It's a giant bubble and lives are going to be crushed. Divorces, bankruptcies. It's all fun and games until gravity catches up on you.

Inflation makes you invest to look for returns. It makes money go around and helps some people buy their homes (inflation will make your mortgage payment easier with time). Inflation represents increased overall created wealth.

That's very misinformed. Keynes wasn't a moron. He was a renowned and respected economist who shaped the economic cycles from the 1940s to the 1970s. Which happen to be the most prosperous decades in US history.
And Bitcoin is nothing right now as a currency. Less people today accept it as a currency than a year ago since nobody uses them and everyone hoards them. It's so impractical that bitcoin debit cards will convert to USD for practical purposes. 
It relies on faith that it will be worth something tomorrow. Maybe it will go to $1M one day, but this will not prove its intrinsic worth aside from the fact that enough people find it valuable .
But as long as I cannot get a fifth of jack, pay my rent or my power bill or ask my boss to pay me  with bitcoin, it will be a theory that people pay actual money for.

On average, incomes are growing more than inflation. But averages hide the ugly truth of today's income inequalities.
There are winners and losers on that front. It's better today to be a code monkey in San Francisco than a farm hand in Minnesota. 
Last year for instance I threatened to quit my tech job in the Bay Area and was promised a very fat raise over 3 years.
It's not a currency issue, but a global wage arbitrage one. A boss doesn't give a raise because he can. Nobody's unionized anymore, everything flows very easily from one continent to the next. It's not a flaw in the USD but how globalization made the world flat.

If you have money in bitcoin, share this information while preparing your estate. Because it's like money stored in a  foreign country's bank account: unless someone knows it's out there nobody will ever know about it.
Storing it in a centralized database? With all the information required to reclaim it? You're putting a giant bull's eye on your business and you WILL be hacked eventually (like Equifax, which has access to the best protection).
An alternative would be a device that would disclose the keys automatically if you haven't entered a code at a certain date. A sort of dead man switch. You have a small electronic physical and NOT CONNECTED device that asks you for a code every other week. If it doesn't, it connects and sends a GPS location to a stored email address or phone number to say "the bitcoin locket is at 40.12.232 degrees north and 30.23.21 West". Please retrieve it and include it in my estate.

I am addressing the actual value of Bitcoin. To understand how much it is worth, you have to figure what chunk of the economy it can represent.
Let's say Bitcoin becomes a currency for a $500B global drug trade, then the value of Bitcoin is roughly $24K (500/21).
If a failed country decides to run on it then Bitcoins will increase in value, except if this country decides to create its own bitcoin. But having your own currency didn't work out and this country would be better off piggybacking on a bigger player (USD, the currency of many failed third world economies) or Bitcoin. All for the sake of stability.

Well, bitcoin relies on trust that it has value. You could say that fiat currencies like the USD also rely on trust: trust that the government will make sure you can use your money, trust that the institution that holds it will not take off with it, trust that the system behind it is defended against enemies, domestic and foreign.
Say you buy your coins on an exchange and that exchange is hacked by someone in Belarus. There is no scenario where you will ever get any law enforcement authority working to get your coins back. The exchange will fight for its survival and do some work but with very limited means. 
But USD? A bank gets robbed, you have FDIC insurance making you whole (up to 250K per account) and cops sent to go after the robbers.

Either Bitcoin is adopted by major countries or it will become a niche currency for failed countries and illegal business.
But even for illegal business it relies on mainstream-economy players to give it an actual value. How good were the bitcoins you got for this kil of cocaine if you cannot buy a house or a car or a boat with them since no one would take them off your hands.
A possible scenario would be an [Ozark]( economy where an entire region with real world interactions with the outside would run on bitcoins. People would come and visit or buy stuff with fiat currency and you would give this fiat currency to get bitcoins from outsiders that you would use internally.

Personally I love FDIC insurance.

You are not wrong. I started using email in 1991 or 1992 professionally and did my first online car rental booking in 1996. When I showed up at the car rental company branch in Europe everyone was puzzled at why you would do it through an unreliable dial-up connection and not over the phone. Someone had to search for it in their system and it took 20 minutes to find it.
But the acceptance came very fast.
But since Bitcoin is less accepted today in stores than a year ago, what action does this tool actually perform? Or are these just shiny tools that will sit pretty as collectibles?
When I was a kid I started playing chess and my dad wanted to offer me an electronic chess player. That was a really cool game at the time (early 80s) but I didn't see the point. My old chess board was doing its function perfectly and I found fighting a machine pretty dull. Plus the goal was to play with someone, not sit there on my own. It sat there, a precious piece of electronic equipment, unused. 
My point: a new tool has to be compelling to replace something that has been around for 1000s of years like physical currency. The switch has to be a Ahah moment. Where is it for Bitcoin?
The USD is only marginally physical. Most of it is exchanged electronically, instantly and for a very small fee. And it they are lost, the company that stores or transfers them needs to be FDIC insured which makes it extremely safe.

Bitcoin is the answer to a question that was never really asked, and libertarians who want to sell bitcoin to the world mostly want a reshuffling of the cards to get a better deal for themselves.
As the Trump/GOP + Brexit debacles have shown, someone can criticize a working system all he wants, but is he able to replace it with a better one, especially with zero experience and a ton of built-in prejudice?
We are not in a survivalist/post-apocalyptic TV series or video game. This is real life where everything has taken decades to be built to run smoothly the way it does right now. We do not need bitcoin.

The scary thing with price discovery is that it can lead to Zero. For instance in the early 20th century tons of people in Europe would be sold deeds for property in California.

"fiat is dying"
Do not confuse things heard from like-minded people with what is happening in real life. We all live in our own bubble.
But I will agree with one thing. Current zero-bound interests (aka free money) have helped prop up asset prices to artificial levels. The reason? They're trying to fix the economy using the wrong tools but the core reason is a recent dogma.
The way fiscal and monetary policy worked in the past using the old Keynesian system: 
A crisis occurs, the government spends money to invest in the future and keep people busy (education, research, infrastructure, social programs). It borrows money but doesn't raise or lower taxes. Deficit increase. Inflation stays tame and interest rates are lowered marginally to help.
The crisis recedes and the people are getting better jobs, unemployment drops, companies increase salaries and inflation picks up. The government gets more taxes paid, rates increase. The government pulls back from its keynesian programs. The deficit shrinks. Yes the debt is still there but because of the growth it's much more manageable.
What Ayn Rand aficionados have done since the 80s is stop the Keynesian engine. They lower taxes and government expenses during crisis, making everything worse. Obama tried to fight it, but republicans blocked his Keynesian attempts.
The last resort of Obama in 2010-2014 was to inject $1T a year in the economy through Quantitative Easing, which is basically cash lent at almost 0% interest. With 0% interest you will blow speculative bubbles. People who expected 4% ROI to make a living have to pump asset prices and hope it doesn't crash out before they've bailed out. But once you borrow trillions at 0% you can't raise rates or get inflation to pick up or else the entire thing collapses. This is our current bind.
It's not a USD issue. The USD is fine. The issue is we're using the wrong tools in our economic cycles, and we're doing it because the Ayn Rand crazies have taken over the asylum.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:09
That's a perversion of what Keynes had in mind.
Now, to be true, the various QEs did help prop up the economy, for now. It turns out some of the people with appreciating assets will spend more or cash out or even invest in something productive, and this in turn helped create the virtuous circle we are in.
But what I think this means is that we are in for a GR  These asset prices will collapse like in 2007. Because we didn't apply the actual Keynesian principles, and because our economy is so dysfunctional that Keynesianism would be impossible to implement. In the Keynesian 50s, marginal tax rates were over 90%. Today all we hear is cut-cut-cut.

Bubbles happen when expectations on an asset precede the actual realization of the asset's performance. 
The housing bubble of 2000-2006 happened because 15% annual gains were consistent and expected, even though RE brings 3 to 5% net. But the money cashed out during the bubble was actually only debt spent forward. The debt was suddenly called and people and banks were in trouble. Then the boost on the economy was gone, the people who lost their homes stopped consuming, banks stopped lending and everyone lost a ton on the stock market crash.
For Bitcoin, say you have a pool of 20 Million shares valued at $100. Then as trading proceeds, only 5 Million shares are exchanged and reach $20000 per. The total actual money sunk into the shares could be in 100 Billion. Valuation is 400B. Someone got that cash, yes, and it's a zero-sum game that way.
On that you are correct.
But the trading doesn't happen in the void. 
On the up side: People richer on paper are going to spend more. They are gong to waste it on depreciating assets (splurging on fancy cars) instead of keeping it in a more productive asset class (stock market or  cash in the bank that will be used as collateral) and net value will be lost. People who want to speculate are going to mortgage their houses. Borrow to give money to someone else: sounds familiar?
On the down side: People who are under water are going to consume less. People who realize losses might not be able to make their mortgage payments. Some people will raid their kid's college funds to make up for the losses. The correction will have an impact on the real economy.
