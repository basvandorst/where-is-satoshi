I'm very hopeful for a technical future where consensus rules and centralized governments are a thing of the past. I have explained this to my lawyer and banker friends and they keep stating that we need "catalysts" (politicians) to make the final decisions for us. They cite California's referendums increasing spending and cutting taxes as a bad example of citizen driven policies. I tell them all politicians spend more and run deficits to get reelected. They also say that we can't function without debt.
Wouldn't a fully decentralized and transparent society take budgets and all public information into account? Please help my argument and add your thoughts for what they future may look like after the Bitcoin and public blockchain revolution. Thank you.

To avoid these issues. Create a fresh tails boot USB from a signed download of the OS. Download bitaddress.org files from Github and verify them as well. Then boot tails, once in, run bitadress.org files and create your BIP 38 paper wallet. Write down the encrypted private keys or take a picture. Memorize passphrase. 
The only attack vector is brute force or a $5 wrench attack.

All of that can be automated. Risk can be managed with 1000X better verification and security than the current system. Micro lending and insurance will replace it all.

I am against economic growth for the sake of economic growth. If it enriches the populous without harming anyone, the planet, and is fairly distributed, than great. But that is not the fact with modern day capitalism. Currently capitalism is a pyramid scheme with those at the top reaping all the benefits. With Bitcoin and its inflationary properties, people will only spend their money on things they need and resources that are available. We need to end the current corrupt fallacy of capitalism. Resource based economies are the way for those who work the hardest, to keep the most they can of what they own and not be forced into debt slavery.

So this basically makes mining worth more than just mining. All the numbers being crunched are for research purposes.

You should add an area for users to be able to cut and paste the public address (and amt. data) so it's easier to use for all wallets. Also, 50c is kind of steep.
So this is actually a paywall for video content. Can't a user just use bitwall and skin it to their liking for the same result?
Also, the site doesn't look great on mobile. Need to work on your responsive CSS for the header, body font sizes and footer.

No what? Exchanges aren't off-chain?
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:46:56
Even if you anonymized the coins by mixing. And only used TOR/Tails for all purchases. What would you buy that couldn't be tied back to you? If you want to purchase anything real, it had to be mailed to you. You could buy digital goods, but those are easily tracked when you cash them in. Want to use in person? There are cameras in every store, street corner and toll. So it's impossible to be completely anonymous even using Bitcoin or anything else.
@_date: 2015-12-31 20:04:23

A cloud (bank) wallet is "outside the security of Bitcoin" as you will be trusting a 3rd party with your private keys. Not the best situation. "If you don't hold the keys, you just have an IOU..." This is also very true. So get a good wallet like electrum, mycelium or Breadwallet or just create your own paper wallets (offline) for the best and most secure storage.
The advantages of cloud wallets are ease of use. If you're looking for that, just leave pocket money (under 1 BTC) for easy spending.

No. It is not safe. It is not safe from Coinbase freezing your account if you participate in any unsavory activity at any time whether intentional or accidental. (Like sending some friend some coin and they spend it at a gambling site or dark web). Get a real wallet like Mycelium of Breadwallet and control your own funds. That's kind of the whole point of Bitcoin.

I am also a seriously paranoid Bitcoin user. Cold storage needs to be ice cold. Like as close to absolute zero you can get.
You can ensure that no hacker will ever be able to get your coins with Bitaddress.org. It's open source and verified by the community. Get the files from GitHub and run a signature test to be 100% sure you have the clean code.
Yes, an Ububtu boot USB is the safest option. Make sure you test the signature of that too.
Then boot Ubuntu off the USB. Make sure you are never connected to the Internet. No wifi or hard connections. Then on another USB, copy and run your clean copy of Bitaddress.org in Ubuntu. Click paper wallet tab and BIP38 7 paper wallets. Your BIP38 passphrase should be very unique and longer than 12 characters. I like alpha numeric phrases and use over 20 characters often. Write those down on paper and store safely or memorize. Then print to PDF and save the PDF back on the USB that Bitaddress.org was on.
The PDF now has 7 fully encrypted paper wallets. With a long passphrase it would take 5000 years for the biggest botnet to decode them. Maybe longer.
Test by sending a small amount of funds to the first one. Use mycelium or Breadwallet mobile app to swipe. Just point and shoot the encrypted QR code and enter the passphrase. 
The magic of this is these paper wallets can be saved on Dropbox, printed at work. Copied on a copy machine. Even put on a banner in Times Square. They are protected by the best math in the world.

Create payment nodes. Revise the way Bitcoin ATM's work. Users can deposit fiat at any node location and then the cash will be up for grabs on the decentralized exchange. The seller of the Bitcoin can then put up the offer to sell. And if won, they can then visit any node location and withdrawal get their cash (via an encrypted key after the trade). This will end the need for banks to do wire transfers to exchanges.

Here is a good practice that is extremely safe and secure. Make 7 BIP38 paper wallets via Bitaddress.org (offline and memorize the alphanumeric passphrase) then save as a PDF. Print them and cut out. Let's say you like to always have 1 Bitcoin handy but you don't trust your mobile wallet/device for medium/long term storage. 
Load up .2 Bitcoin into 5 of the paper wallets and keep them in your wallet. Remember you also have the PDF as a backup. Now, when you want to spend, use Breadwallet or mycelium to swipe a paper wallet and load .2 into your mobile wallet. Super fast and easy.
Go from cold storage to a hot wallet in seconds. The only thing is you must use a nice BIP38 passphrase and memorize it.
Practice first with very small amounts. It's fun!

I don't think that most people realize that ANY online transaction or key creation is not safe. Even if you have multi-sig, your computer or connection could be compromised. There are tons of browser exploits. The multi-sig Coinbase account is not safe and is just lipstick on a pig. Use HD wallets for your hot wallets and cold storage for the rest. Dedicated offline electrum or Armory is by far the best. Paper wallet with BIP 38 is 2nd best. That is what all the experts do. That is what I do. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:28:02
I never understood brain wallets. Those are the ones that I hear getting hacked. Paper wallets with a BIP 0038 encrypted private key are much easier to use and safer. You'll have a nice paper wallet, with public address to add to. Then a nicely encrypted private key. You can roll dice and shuffle/flip cards to generate a good passphrase. Make multiple copies and store in very safe places like a safe deposit box, your parents house, work file, etc.

I've experienced that many sites use the same sending addresses because they batch out payments. Mining pools do this all the time. I don't have much experience with online gambling but I assume they have thousands of payments to send out at a time.
I'm sure there are some trackers/crawlers watching tons of "questionable" addresses and I wouldn't doubt that Coinbase keeps a very close eye on all their accounts. And they should. They are big money and have even bigger potential. If there is found to be confirmed illegal Bitcoin activity on Coinbase such as gambling, drugs, laundering, theft, or at worst terrorist funding, they will be shut down and all could be lost. They should be over cautious. As individuals, we should be too.

Interesting point. But the entire process will basically cannibalize Bitpay and Coinbase's business model. Image in a few years when millions of vendors take BTC?

Electrum is awesome and I use it everyday. But I have been creating offline paper wallets and transferring my BTC to them. Pretty much any wallet on a computer is vulnerable, depends on how secure the machine is from malware, viruses and users.
For mobile, I like Coinbase, Blockchain, Coinjar and Coinkite. Experiment (with very small amounts) with all of them until you find one that you like the best.
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:03:00
Well, at least they had a good NY Times article. But the writer left out the scam part.

Coinbase coins are NOT stored on your phone. And if you had the PIN enabled in the app, no one could even try to steal a coin anyway.
You didn't need to email them. Just log in from any web browser and send a transaction to another wallet if you even needed to. 
Make sure you have MAXIMUM SECURITY for all your wallets. PINS for mobile, 2FA for web, and BIP38 for paper wallets.
Oh, and don't hitchhike and sleep alongside a road by yourself in a foreign country.

I understand you are a business. And of course you need to make money. But your chairman totes NO FEES in every speech he makes. I would like to see the "convenience" fee for buys clearly labeled. I love that I can buy instantly. It's amazing. Much better than using over priced bitcoin ATMs. But it's padded and hidden. Open and transparent is the way to go. Also, please offer the option to make your account denominated in bitcoin only. I don't need to always seen the $USD as the default. That should be a toggle or option like Blockchain.info.

I have trapped a few of them and reported the listings. Look for any listing offering mining hardware at a "good" price. Create a separate email address and inquire. They will only accept BTC and only offer shipping. (A true sign of a scammer) Then they steal the BTC and never ship anything. Have heard of this happening many times with people talking on the phone, fake licenses, forged identities, etc.
Just search for Bitcoin miner and some of the scammers pop out quite obviously.

Make sure your coins are properly distributed among several addresses.
Large amounts:
Multiple paper wallets created offline. I create .1 and .5 BTC paper wallets and keep them and copies in safe place. BIP0038 encrypted private keys and a nice long and easily remembered (by you) passphrases. Safest way to store.
Small/liquid amounts:
Coinbase online/mobile wallet - most convenient for purchasing BTC.
Pheeva Wallet - great GYFT integration
Blockchain wallet - wicked secure
The Blockchain and Pheeva wallets can swipe paper wallets extremely fast.
Any questions?

Do it manually.
Using TOR, create an account on Cryptsy. Transfer some BTC to Cryptsy from Coinbase or anywhere else. Buy some Doge or LTC and immediately sell. With minor price flux and small fees you may lose up to 1%. Then withdrawal funds to where you want them to go anonymously. Quite easily done.

Love breadwallet, but as you previously said, their is a moment when signing a TX that the wallet is not encrypted. If there was a security flaw on iOS not yet recognized, it could steal your coins. Cold paper is the safest in my book. Created on a linux machine that has never been online. Armory offline may actually be colder, but a pain in the arse in my book.
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:43:36
Still not safer than a BIP0038 encrypted paper wallet.

Why does that make us look bad? We need to tout that Doge easier to use for kids and first time adopters.
Unless a kid is good at calculating 5 decimal places, it's hard to use BTC in small amounts. Also, the minimum .0001 (6+ cent) transaction fees can get eaten up very quickly.
My 9 and 6 year old have started playing with Doge and sending 5 or 10 at a time is much easier. They are thrilled when they get 5 Doge. You can't send .0000075 BTC without it costing .0001075 BTC. My son is not even doing fractions yet in 3rd grade.

No seal breaking necessary. As with electrum an offline clean and disconnected from the internet machine is necessary for best security. You can test BIP0038 passphrases in bitaddress.org without going online. 
I have never had a problem with using bitaddress.org and have created and swiped hundreds of paper wallets. BIP0038 encrypted and not. I feel this is the highest security and best security for my use.
Edit: in addition, I use the pheeva wallet on iOS to swipe my paper wallets. It then moves the funds to a change address. Works flawlessly.
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:45:33
If I swipe a paperwallet with my breadwallet, pheeva or blockchain wallet, the funds are fully transferred to a new address. For new adopters, most mobile and web wallets are fine, but for serious users, offline Linux paper wallet creation is as easy as toasting bread.

I am not only pegged to BTC, im a doge supporter since last year. Mining it, spending, tipping, buying and selling. That coin was not premined and very open on policies and has huge support and strong dev backing. Maidsafe is so intriguing to me. I thought it was going to be integrated with bitcoin. Actually the first video said it was going to be. Then I hear it's now some safe coin business. So I will follow it closely over the next few years. But another alt on the exchanges is just a waste. I'm also a big fan of Storj, I think that uses BTC.

Can I start a Bitcoin-only restaurant and exchange cash $USD for people at the restaurant? Just $50-$100 per person on request. Thinking of also crowd funding meals. i.e. Let people contribute to pre-order a whole hog, or a truck load of Maine lobsters, etc. (To save money).
Thinking of calling it "Chomping on the Bit"
The other aspect of the restaurant would be to get people to associate their first name with their public address and have all the items on the menu have qr code. I.e. customer orders entree &amp; drink. Then waiter comes and delivers a gin &amp; tonic and veal parmesan for "Steve". No more annoying splitting the bill stuff.

1. Stop checking the price
2. Calculating proft
3. Stop checking Reddit
4. Stop buying BTC
5. Stop spending BTC
6. Stop playing around with the technology
WHY??? YOU ASK?
Because every time I have stepped away, I have missed  a major piece of news, breakthrough, or incredibly interesting post.
So, no, even though you may think the price is down, it's not. It's still pretty far up and well beyond anyone's expectations.
Also, I have plenty of hobbies, play lots of sports, spend time with family, eat, drink, etc. So BTC is my escape.

Do not create your paper wallets on coinbase! Actually do not even create them on a computer that has been online! Boot off a USB or DVD with a fresh Ubuntu install.

I just read FinCEN’s guidance and it says:
An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN’s regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person.
Each person who receives in the U.S. currency or other monetary instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 at one time which have been transported, mailed, or shipped to such person from any place outside the United States with respect to which a report has not been filed under paragraph (a) of this section, whether or not required to be filed thereunder, shall make a report thereof, stating the amount, the date of receipt, the form of monetary instruments, and the person from whom received.
So it’s clear that under $10,000 is perfectly safe and legal per person, per day without registering as a MSB.

Why do you even need to create a new coin? The basic rule is that if you have extra drive space, you can lease it out and get paid. If you don't have enough drive space, you pay crypto for what you need. Simple idea. I still don't understand why they need their own tokens.

To sum it up from various posts. (This stuff is fascinating, even though I'm not a developer)










So basically it would take many many GH/s of Scrypt ASICS to MAYBE crack a BIP0038 encrypted passphrase (with the encrypted passphrase in hand). So I think I'm pretty safe.
BUT! When I make new paper wallets, I'm going to make some strong ass passphrases! Going to start now!

You should offer some low volume fees to get business from new Bitcoiners. This could take a lot of business away from Americans using Coinbase. You can get your first Bitcoin there instantly with proper verification and VISA card backup. I'm sure you could figure out something to incite newbies.
Something like a 1% fee and a small bank fee.
An integrated wallet partner would be great for newbies as well. 
This would make it much easier to market to the newly signed on client base and present them with offers and incentives to start trading. Bam, the barriers to entry fall down.

That paper is bunk. Would never happen or work. Try it for yourself!

Most all my paper wallets are .1 BTC. That way I can cash in what I need and reload a cloud wallet for mobile spending. 
Train your wife on how to scan and swipe the keys. It's really easy in Blockchain.info.
Also, I found a great way to backup my cold storage. I take an old digital camera and take pictures of the private keys and then store the memory chip in a very safe place just in case.

What's your plans?
Are you going to be holding a lot of bitcoin? Then research offline cold storage and offline paper wallet generation.
Are you going to be sending a lot of smaller transactions? Then keep most BTC in cold storage and spending money in an HD wallet like Electrum or an HD mobile wallet like breadwallet or mycellium.
IMO desktop wallets are the least secure hot wallets. Desktops are the most vulnerable to malware and bitcoin stealing thieves.
If you learn how to use electrum or Armory offline and then use a desktop wallet to send signed tx, then that is a very safe plan as well.
My current strategy for safety and convenience is to create paper wallets offline and BIP38 encrypt them. Then I carry around with me .1 to .5 BTC on paper. (I keep copies in a safe place too). I store a little in my iOS breadwallet and if I need some more , I swipe a paper wallet in 3 seconds and then make my transaction. It's safe to make copies and expose BIP38 wallets, as long as you have a good passphrase that you wont forget.
tl:dr It all depends on your lifestyle.

2. Keep MULTIPLE copies of your BIP0038 paper wallets and passphrases in safe places like a safe, your moms house, a very good hiding spot, buried underground, etc. (password gone=lost Bitcoin)
3. Once you fund the addresses, you can always look up the values on blockchain.info.

Decentralized loans will happen. People are willing to pay interest to borrow. You, me, anyone can put up their bitcoin and collect interest. Like a bitcoin moneymarket or trust account. Loans are given to those who qualify with putting up collateral and other predetermined agreements. Since the loan terms will be fully agreed ahead of time, the agreement is in the blockchain in a multi signature protected file. Borrowers must meet the requirements of the loan or face the same exact types of consequences that any loan default would cause. Property leins, payroll deduction, etc. The magic is there is no chance of government, regulatory, or corporate malfeasance as the intermediary is math.
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:01:46
Traditional measuring of credit is insignificant as the borrower will have to take full responsibility for the loan. They will have to meet certain agreed upon and verified factors such as employment, collateral, etc. Like I said, if you don't re-pay on time, certain triggers will go into effect.
There will need to be an intermediary, but not like a bank today as we know it. New startups will be rolling out this type of blockchain technology within the next few years. It will replace standard loan procedures as we know it. Whether using bitcoin or not.

It is practically impossible to bruteforce a BIP0038 encrypted private key that was encrypted correctly on an offline computer. The passphase would have to be something very short. It would take a super computer years to crack it.

That is already being done. There are thousands of hackers trying to brute force millions of private keys on a daily basis. 2^256 = number of BTC addresses. Pretty secure.

So you will lose money on your $60 investment. Getting about $32 back is not breaking even. Should have just spent your BTC at one of the many fine retailers and just re-loaded as you spent.

I took an old PC out of the closet and wiped that hard drive super clean NSA style (35 passes). Installed Ubuntu from a CD that I made and have never connected or will connect to the internet. My Ubuntu is also password protected and encrypted as far as I can get it.
Hard wired a printer (no wifi). I use bitaddress.org files from Github and make BIP0038 encrypted paper wallets with long random word passphrases. Print and check that the printer batch file is erased. 
All ports are disabled and there is no wifi on the computer at all or even possible.
The only downside is that it's an old computer and it can take a few minutes to BIP0038 encrypt the private key.
Once printed, I laminate the paper wallets and store safely in a secret location. I also make a bunch and only store .1 to .5 BTC on each one.
When figuring all this out, I made a ton of "tester" paper wallets and swiped them to make sure I was doing this right. Each with just a little BTC just in case.

Actually I may be wrong though. Since analysis of transaction history is quite easy, Coinbase may track all incoming coins all the back to their creation/when they were mined.

You don't need to know change addresses if you swipe your paper into breadwallet, blockchain, coinbase, Pheeva, etc for hot funds. I agree on the HD offline wallet, going to try that but then, possibly, in 10 years, when you may need to pull funds out of HD cold storage, the libraries could have changed, been updated, etc and your passphrase wont produce the same keys. Is that a possibility with more BIP0032 development?

If we start seeing keys on dicks in porno's, then this video is to blame.
But seriously, all the methods are good with a few tweaks:
1. Brain Wallet - Ok, but you need to memorize a long random phrase that would be impossible to figure out. Not a song or quote.
2. Paper Wallet - ok, but you need to create it on an offline computer and BIP0038 encrypt the private key with a passphrase like  I like the storing in the ground idea but it's hard to retrieve. Better than a bank safety box.
3. USB Key. Ok, but the wallet must be encrypted with a long passphase like  Don't store it in the fridge, the cold and condensation could destroy it. Best to store in a cool dry and secret place. (also, recently a story broke that USB keys could have infected firmware, so I don't store on them anymore).
4. Cloud Storage. Ok, but the wallet must be BIP008 encrypted with a long passphase like  and the storage should have 2FA for best security.
5. Email. Ok, but same as  Good encryption and 2FA.
6. Great idea! But the pet should be named with the BIP0038 encrypted private key with a long passphrase like a paper wallet. But if WOW ever dies, this is lost though.
7. Ummm. Gross but see  for safety.

Wrong. They process immediately. The 10 minutes is confirmation and some services/businesses can require a number of confirmations. But for regular (smaller) purchases, it's instant.


It can be anonymous if the transactions can't be traced. For example, if you setup an unverified account at an exchange and then transfer in some BTC, then buy an altcoin and then sell, then xfer the coins out to a new address. It's like washing coins. (as long as you don't use a web wallet like Coinbase or Circle).


True now but soon many exchanges will offer multi-signature escrow so that your coins can't be moved anywhere without your approval.
True about mining.

Use an HD wallet like breadwallet

"We are millimeters into a marathon." 
So patience is needed. There's a lot of work to be done. I give it until 2018-2020 until the next big step and BTC is ready for the general public. Soon there will be thousands of BTC ATM's with very competitive fees and almost exchange level pricing. Big players will hold more BTC and the price will rise very slowly as adoption occurs. That is what we want. No bubbles or panics. Steady growth, adoption and development.

I haven't dealt with these other exchanges but I still think Coinbase is quite slow and annoying. Have to wait a week after buying to receive BTC and wait a week to get $USD after selling. I know this problem is due to potential chargebacks, but their biggest challenge is to make BTC more easily available to the masses.
(Edit) I'm aware of MtGox and their issues and they make Coinbase look amazing.

So you want them to take bitcoin so they can not report full amounts? I don't understand how bitcoin will help that. In NYC the meter is the one that keeps the records, not the credit card machine. They pay their % to the cab company, taxes, etc. based on the meter. The only advantages of btc vs CC processing fees, as with everyone else.
Maybe for the scammy livery drivers, btc is better. But those monkeys usually demand cash only, if they're not on a call from their dispatcher.

None of the 2014 pre-sales have shipped. (KnC, Cointerra, Black Arrow, BFL, Hasfast). It must either be manufacturers running their machines before shipping to consumers. SCAM!
Or private Bitcoin hardware firms like 21e6 running their own machines. Either way, it's the consumers who are getting fukked. Say goodbye to breaking even with any machine delivered after the end of February.

Are you well versed on blockchain technology? Loans, smart contracts and financing can all be done as trustless and seamless transactions. Much more efficient than the current systems. For example, contracts can be linked to all sorts of trigger actions. We will see this over the next few years whether bitcoin the currency is still  But we will never see any money multipliers like traditional (scam) loans are. This will bring us back to a more resource based economy.

Ask KnC! The reason is clear. A company that ships quality miners on time gets a great reputation and returning customers. They also get to make a large profit on the hardware and fund their own mining efforts. It's a win win for a company that follows good business practices. Unfortunately 1 out of 10 is not good for the reputation of the industry.

The gold market is hugely flawed. There isn't even close to the amount of reserves as there is "paper" gold. Reserves have been melted down, transferred, bought, sold, melted down again, and the process is repeated. All along securities are sold with the presumed gold as a backer. (There is also a large amount of counterfeit tungsten loaded gold). If all the "paper" gold was required to be pinned to physical gold, the paper market would crash and the physical gold market would skyrocket to $10,000+ an ounce. That's the problem with gold ETF's, they aren't real, it's impossible to audit, and there is massive fraud. If gold prices went up drastically, we would see major banks failing, wars start, and an international crisis. So $20 is nothing.
Watch this (a little boring but very informative).

What about all those DIY Bitcoin ATM's? Can someone make a much cheaper unit like a Piper? 
If the units weren't $19K, then they wouldn't have to charge the 7%. And in relation, the 7% is equivalent to taking out $40 and paying a $3 fee. Most people take out more $ when they are paying an ATM fee. So the 7% is way too high.

The wallet is very similar in concept to electrum. It also takes care of all your change addresses. So it's great for importing paper wallets. It swipes the pw and then moves it all to a new address. After every TX it moves the coins to a new private key so you're always safe.

This guy is just a shill for conservative billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. They founded the Cato institute and manipulate and bribe government officials for their own financial goals. CATO institute is a criminal organization funded by conservative groups such as The Bradley, Lynde and Harry Foundation, The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, Dunn's Foundation for the Advancement of Right Thinking, and many other groups. All which are funded by billionaire conservatives. 
Their goals are:
Opposition to Wall Street Reform
Opposition to Campaign Finance Reform
Support for Eliminating Ballot Referendum "Donor Disclosure" Requirements
Amplification of Climate Change Denial - Cato Fellow Patrick Michaels Runs Climate Denial PR Firm
Alliance with the Tobacco Industry - Claims that "Secondhand Smoke Risks Are Debatable"
Criticism of the Executive Branch on Civil Liberties

Yes. But you must use a virgin (never has or will be online) computer. Dig an old laptop out of the closet. Install Ubuntu from DVD. Copy bitaddress.org GitHub files via a 7-pass wiped USB drive. Use a USB printer (no wireless). Use lots of dice, cards, coins to generate a nice long BIP0038 passphrase. Make a few $1 wallets and practice swiping a bunch at bitaddress.org before making larger ones. I feel safer with a bunch of smaller wallets than a few big ones. Store safely and keep the public keys handy so you could add to them if you want.

Full copy:
We can all agree that the current financial system is not perfect by any stretch. The question is, is the new system now being touted by the People’s Front of Libertaria, led by the likes of Marc Andreessen and Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne likely to be any better?
Chances are no, it’s likely to be even worse.
In fact, we propose it’s just a recasting of the old story of Animal Farm, where the animals band together to throw out their evil oppressors only to unwittingly replace them with an even greedier variety in the long run.
Hence, of course, the propaganda onslaught to convince you that what is being offered up is somehow revolutionary, when it’s actually nothing but the same old, same old. The revolution relates only to who the new overlords are.
So let’s analyse what’s really going on.
Take the latest spin on the cryptocurrency movement as an empowering and cheap mechanism to take yourself to market without the greedy paws of the banks getting a cut.
Lovely in theory. Except… consider the overriding motives of a venture capital industry no longer prepared to benevolently support the no-earnings business models they love to fund — more often than not focused on communication, attention, brain-washing, reactance and manufacturing-consent type endeavours — because they’re burning through their cashpiles at rates that they can’t even stomach.
If only there was a way, you know, for mom and pop to burn their cash supporting the industries that like to lobotomise their children directly?
But how to convince the older generation to freely hand over money to the sort of businesses their kids love to love, but can’t pay for, but which go against the very interests of any parent focused on developing a well rounded individual fit for critical analysis and engagement in the real world? How do you convince parents, after all, to pay for their children to be indoctrinated and plugged into the compliance matrix? Turn the whole thing into an investment proposition, of course.
Here’s Byrne evangelising about a future where Wall Street becomes utterly decentralised and unsupervised, to the extent that everyone can take themselves to market at zero cost.
Code-named “Medici,” the project aims to democratize Wall Street in much the same way bitcoin seeks to democratize currency and payments. By operating separate from traditional stock exchanges and the big corporate banks, it could eliminate certain loopholes in the system and reduce the costs associated with issuing and juggling stock.
Aside from the fact that the codename ‘Medici‘ is pretty telling in and of itself (surely the Medici didn’t end up becoming a multi-generational elite? – Ed), it’s the scant discussion over the fact that listings rules exist for a reason.
Let’s not even mention the fact that the little amount of decentralisation we’ve had thus far (we’ve had quite a lot, no – ed?) led to a massive wising up of the supposedly informed money management industry about how decentralisation doesn’t serve their interests at all.
In fact, wasn’t the whole HFT fiasco based on the buyside finally realising the extent to which decentralisation had allowed ruthless predators with access to superior information to ruthlessly exploit them? Wasn’t the response “we need more centralisation not less!”?
So with the buyside wising up in this way, is it any surprise a new source of dumb money needs to be found for ventures that make no economic sense, but do encourage subservient tendencies to the new information overlords, needs to be identified pronto?
Let’s now look at how Marc Andreessen — the man who thinks monetising every facet of journalism will improve it on the integrity front — plans to upend the old world of finance.
From an exclusive interview with Bloomberg markets magazine:
‘‘The startups chasing disruptive technology aren’t working within the existing system. This is the cryptocurrency phenomenon. If it works, we can re-implement the entire financial system as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized system. We can reinvent the entire thing.
‘‘Bitcoin is clearly in this category. With bitcoin, there are advantages to decentralizing the financial system in order to do commerce. For instance, you can make payments in all but four countries. So, on day one, you can use it all over the world. Forget about all the different currencies and banking systems; it’s a truly universal way to transfer value.
‘‘That also means we have the chance to radically lower fees. Most consumer transactions are weighted with a 3 percent fee; remittances run up to 10 percent, which I think is a moral crime. There’s a big opportunity to take those fees out.’’
Bold claims, you might think, from a man talking his book and being interviewed by a company that is …
To sum up the article’s points briefly, without the spin:
Regulating the banks means that the bad practices they were able to get away with can now be transferred to non-banks, among them tech companies.
Software people don’t need to meet people in the flesh to make wild presumptions about their behaviours, because to them they’re all deterministic agents without freewill anyway.
Quantitative tools can help those who fate has called upon to be society’s overlords to more easily stamp out free-will across the rest economy, thanks to the magic of making people think their choices are real when really they are not. Yes, they’ll all be gamed and redirected where needed before they even step out of bed.
You’ll be credit rated not on your track-record to date, but your Minority Report-esque future track-record which is apparently already pre-determined. We like to call it Judgment Day.
A distributed system is better not because it splits the masses up and thus stops them from organising against the overlords, but rather because it extends the divine obligation of make payments to the chosen few to everyone universally.
Bitcoin is brilliant because it transfers the cost of segregating an ever greater wealth pool in society to users directly. What’s even better is they don’t realise they’re paying for it by giving up their right to self-determination!
A financial system that can maintain the rigid hierarchy of yesteryear by persuading the masses to pay for that classification with the cunning use of myth-making propaganda is so much cheaper than having to police it on a soul-to-soul basis.
Bitcoin is a battle between the light or the dark side. If it works, we will all serve the new capital elite of Silicon Valley, and they presumably will dutifully serve the pseudonymous Sataoshi Nakomoto forever. On both fronts it’s subservience to masked and unknown entities.
Our investments are dualistic. The pay-offs will either be infinity-to-one or zero-to-one. It’s the zero theorem test for society. If zero equals something, it can’t equal nought. If it equals nought it can’t equal something. Something out of nothing is not possible. But since it is with Bitcoin, which means we’ve figured out the meaning of life! Life is all about being a servant to someone more powerful than you!
We needed to develop a cult to create the system, because otherwise it would never have been sanctioned by reasonable society.
Who needs to trust people or society. All you need is belief in ethereal mathematics and technology that has arrived from Mars and which can uphold the deals you do with the ethereal masked entities for all eternity in the blockchain. There’s no way out once your fate is sealed.
Last and not least…
Andreessen says that the reason computer scientists are so excited about Bitcoin is because no-one has as yet figured out what’s wrong with it. Every problem, you see, has been anticipated by the great “designer”. Or as he puts it: “That’s the magic of why everyone out here is so excited about it”.
Which, we guess, is fair enough if you think a perfect system features mass wealth concentration, a rigid hierarchal system that depends on persuasion and subjugation of the masses, no-one ever forgetting anything you do, no-one ever being able to change their mind either, wasteful energy destruction, and for the majority of of us, having to spend more of our lives navigating through incredibly hot data centres preparing to be forked at anytime.
No voodoo or cultic ritual here. No God complex either. And certainly no “you’re either with us or against us” talk or — oh by the way, didn’t you know this was just a giant Beta test for eternity in the Cloud?
The funny thing is we don’t actually disagree with Andreessen that the old banking model is dying — note our Death of Banking series. We just think there’s a difference between suggesting banks are becoming irrelevant because steady returns on capital can no longer be achieved without foreknowledge and/or manipulation of behaviour patterns with skilful public brainwashing, and killing off banks and replacing them in the top spot because you’re better at manipulating behaviour patterns with skilful public brainwashing than they are.
Full disclosure: This author is working on a book about the financial system’s increasing dependence on cult markets for preserving value and hierarchy in an increasingly abundant system. Bitcoin donations not welcome.

Ummm. No excuse for not knowing how to use BTC safely if you're trading it and investing a lot of $$. There were thousands of posts here and on BTCtalk about NEVER leaving funds on an exchange. 


There is no excuse for not doing your research before investing in anything. 


It was very apparent they were having problems after Spring 2013. Like you said, Google searches should be common and searching MtGox or Butterfly Labs in Spring 2013 revealed more negative results than positive.


Remember the BTC motto: "Never invest anything you aren't willing to lose." I am not a super savvy Bitcoin user, just one who reads Reddit on a regular basis and loves reading about all sorts of technology.

Their model works perfectly with Bitcoin. Even with $USD, they hold it for up to 21 days after an eBay sale. So when people pay in BTC, the funds are held until there is enough time for items to ship. T&amp;C updated that seller assumes risk of exchange rate flux.

Changetip requires more confirmations because they are a centralized service just like a bank. When you use Changetip, you leave all the security of bitcoin and HAVE TO TRUST Changetip. They must be 100% sure that there is no doublespend before allowing you to distribute funds on their system. When you tip, it is NOT a bitcoin transaction, hence, no transaction fee. But at anytime, someone can withdrawal. Can you see why they require such extra time to confirm? Same with exchanges, web wallets, etc. Make a purchase with Bitpay? Instant confirmation and you're good to go. On-blockchain tx are safe and sound, forever.

The fees on a $3 debit card purchase are more than 6 cents. Square used to be 7c a transaction, but now it's more. Also, McDonals has to pay for all those POS machines. With Bitcoin, the cashier can just print a QR code on a receipt.
With $USD: 
Do you ALWAYS go to YOUR bank's ATM? (ATM fees) 
Do you pay any bank fees, ever? (Most banks nickel dime fees). 
Did you have to drive to the ATM? (Gas) 
Did you have to walk to the ATM? (Time = money, worn out shoes).
There are many ways that using cash is more expensive than Bitcoin.

2. You can import BIP38 PK's into many wallets. One of the easiest is breadwallet. Make one and try it. Scan the BIP38 PK and it asks you for the passphrase. Easy.
3. Same as  Import them into an HD wallet like breadwallet. It will automatically swipe the funds and put them into a new address so all coins are sage. Also easy.
Test out using paper wallets into other hot wallet software and see which you like the best. Test with small amounts FIRST.

I have been harassing Hashfast, Cointerra, Black Arrow and others about missing their promised dates. Some have had snarky replies and others have just ignored. Haven't had any comments deleted though. 
I went with KnC because they have the best record and most all their previous models have delivered ROI, even the November Jupiter batch. (650Gh/s for $5K). I know that there have been some KnC issues, but a very low percentage of what was shipped. And I emphasize on shipped.
So my point is that the more these companies flail, the lower the difficulty stays for the rest of us.
And I still think that a Neptune 2nd batch is a good buy. Even if it ships in May/June, it will probably be a 5TH machine. And at $10K, it will produce ROI.

I love articles like this. They are filled with mistakes like "The bitcoin system requires that each new bitcoin is incrementally harder to "mine" than the preceding coin. What this means is that each new bitcoin requires more and more calculation power than the coins that came before." (Difficulty can go down and it doesn't become more difficult instantly).
Also, they didn't mention the real criminals in Bitcoin Mining, the hardware manufacturers! All except KnC have basically stolen people's money to fund their own mining projects while delivering VERY LATE with barely any to zero chance of profitability. They have stolen WAY more than any botnet or virus.

Tell that to the Nazi's when they ran concentration camps. Tell that to ISIS who cold blooded murders and rapes women, children and entire families. Israel warned that weapons caches would get bombed. And Hamas still launched missiles into Israel and escalated the conflict to where it is now. Hamas didn't tell people that there were rockets and weapons in schools and hospitals. I'm sorry, but a terrorist organization is 100% to blame. I am so sorry that innocent lives are killed, it's god awful, and they have nothing to do with politics. I wish none of this ever happened.

Your title has nothing to do with your synopsis. I agree with your title. There is a huge stock and currency bubble. There is a correlation.

He is suing for libel. It covers a wide variety of issues. But since the article was already discredited and most people don't believe he's Satoshi, the case will probably be dismissed. If people really believed he was Satoshi, then he would have been in a world of hurt as hackers and others would do anything to find his keys for his supposed millions of BTC including burglary, or worse.

They must be compliant and I understand that. The unfortunate reality is there newcomers to BTC will pay the price when they eff up. Even if you buy from Coinbase and then sell that BTC to friends, that could violate their loose terms. Best bet is to transfer your coins off of there regularly and use electrum, Armory or Treznor as your wallet for regular use. I also like Pheeva for a web wallet for small transactions.

Just like any new technology, safety is a key issue. I have lost some due to poor password management and trusting the wrong individuals. But I have learned from my mistakes and taught myself everything I can about online and offline wallets as well as cold storage and BIP0038 encryption. I am much happier being in control of my money and it's really interesting to experiment with them. (With small amounts of course).
I now am very confident that my storage vehicles are incredibly secure and will last for a while.

Bitaddress.org. Copy github files to USB. Use an offline UBuntu machine or live DVD and a hard wired printer.
Paper wallet tab, click BIP0038 encrypt. New key pairs are created. Print and done. Actual PK is never displayed and passphrase is never printed. It's up to you to remember.
I've created and tested hundreds of paper wallets. Make a few testers to practice swiping them with different wallets, mobile apps, etc. All don't support BIP38 and you should become an expert swiper. Breadwallet and Blockchain apps work perfectly.

Did you order hardware? Are you dreaming?
GPU's are being re-directed to scrypt coins, but we are about to see increases in the hash rate like never before. 
We are at about 11 PH/s now. We will see the hashrate up to a whopping 100 PH/s by the end of the year.(Based on pre-order data).  And that is a very conservative estimate. 7 PH/s = 1 Billion difficulty. So we will see the difficulty reach at least 14 billion by EOY 2014. 
We will hit the end of consumer products as the power needs will be way beyond what a US home could handle. Could we then see the difficulty level out? Possibly. Or large companies, hedge funds and banks will get involved so they can grab up as much left as possible.

Their minimum for withdrawals is probably 0.01 BTC. I had a similar issue with Bitminer so I decided to buy a block eruptor for sh*ts and giggles. Well, it mined .007 BTC and brought my .003 balance to .01. A WHOPPING $8 at the time! Bitminter refused to let me transfer BTC into the pool to meet the withdrawal minimum. So mining is your only choice. I would lend you my block eruptor but it's only mining .0001 a day now, so it might take a while. But buying a $30 block eruptor to get a $3 payout, is, well, silly...

You have to "rotate" addresses. Once you use an address and sign a transaction, the private key is exposed in way that an attacker can figure it out. You want to use an HD wallet that is based off a phrase like electrum for desktop or breadwallet for iOS. If you want to use the same address over and over and risk theft, then just create 1 paper wallet and keep loading it and swiping it.

1 private key per address. You can create 7 key pairs at a time with the same BIP38 passphrase. Works like a charm. I print sheets of them and then laminate. Good to go. Check the "Hide Art" button.
As far as brain wallets, also use bitaddress.org.  You need a long and high entropy passphrase. Once again, test with small amounts. No printing needed. With an offline machine, nothing gets exposed. No internet, no steal.

Bitcoin has nothing to worry about in regards to attacks from nations. Nations will just eat themselves up until there is nothing left. The U.S. economy is holding on by a thread. Nation states are pretty much handing themselves over to the blockchain and within a few years, bitcoin wallets will be just as common as Angry Birds on all our phones. We don't need to pay all these taxes that go to waste and over regulation. We need regulations removed to spur innovation and financial growth that has not been capable due to the govt's claws in everything. Worried about the future but hopeful for Bitcoin to go mainstream. AND we aren't going to ask for permission, we're going to take it.

BIP0038 encrypted paper wallets are the safest way to store. You don't actually need the paper. I use bitaddress.org and create encrypted private keys on an offline computer. I'll use the same paraphrase for a few wallets and store the public key and encrypted private key in my Dropbox, printed at home, at my desk at work, etc. You can store these anywhere because they would be impossible to steal without the paraphrase. What do I do with the paraphrase? I store it in the public domain. WHAT??? You say? Well I like to use a phrase from a geographic location, or such so that I will never forget it. Think of a place you would never forget,stored publicly is it's coordinates, altitude and population. There is your paraphrase.

One point in the conversation, Andreas said it takes time to move funds from cold storage to a hot wallet to spend them.
It takes me 10 seconds.
I keep BIP38 paperwallets in my work bag. They are copies of my backups with strong passphrases. I only keep a little bit of funds in my hot wallet.
If EVER I need more funds, just swipe a paper wallet in the Blockchain.info iOS app, enter passphrase and funds are immediately available to spend.
And the paper wallet backups are 100% safe to make copies, keep in plain sight because I have BIP0038 encrypted them with a solid passphrase that I remember.
So WHY is Andreas promoting financial friction from cold storage to hot? I have no clue!
@_date: 2014-07-29 19:22:44

Don't use Coinbase for a wallet. Period. It's ok to buy but not store. it has been said over and over in this sub, if you don't hold your private keys, you don't control your money. And hence, you are outside the security of Bitcoin. Get an HD wallet like Breadwallet and keep your hot funds on it. Buy and send to your HD immediately. Use cold storage for the rest of your funds. Not rocket science, it's best practice.

Although that is not advertised, and the buyer must beware, it's a scam and any experienced Bitcoiner knows it. It's not like they are selling shovels and pans to mine gold. The majority of the work is done by the individual's physical efforts, not by the equipment.

He has to get his roommates to either get cash and he deposits it in his bank, and writes one check or they pay him via check 3-4 days before it's due so it's clear. A major pain in the arse.

It's not the cold storage or safe deposit security that's the factor, it's the trust of who created and who is storing the private keys and what encryption they are using. That is not obviously discussed by Coinbase and if that is infiltrated, all the Fort Knox cold storage is out the door.
Also, why would they want to take such responsibility in storing all those Bitcoins? They make no interest, charge any fees or do any lending.

For a retailer, setting up Bitpay as a payment processor will allow users to pay in BTC, but the retailer, gets paid in $USD. Pretty simple. Coinbase can also set this up. But not all countries are supported yet. Coinbase just expanded into Europe. By 2015, there will be more countries supported.

That is fine. A well prepared update (hard fork) showing all the improvements and blessed by the community would be very possible to implement.

I am in advertising for over 15 years. This commercial is funny and smart. It doesn't need say what bitcoin is. Actually it's best not to discuss the technological layer with the mass public. it says that bitcoin is better than existing systems in a clever way. And it succeeds in that very well.
I would like to see an ad in the future when someone travels the world and skips every currency exchange stop at the airports they visit. Ads must clearly show benefit and make the product the hero. 0% fees is pretty mind blowing.

All the wallets (cloud, mobile, desktop) have a positive and negative aspect.
Coinbase. Good for buying and selling. No mobile app. Few features.
Blockchain.info. Tons of features like importing encrypted paper wallets for example. Mobile app has fewer features but works. For more advanced users. 
Electrum, Armory. Very secure. Few features. For more advanced users.
Coin jar. Easy to use. Mobile app phasing out.
Coinkite. Easy to use. Includes Litecoin. Few features.
Paper Wallets. The most secure. Takes practice and needs to be done on a virgin (offline) machine.
Overall, I use them all and test and practice.

Unfortunately international remittances need to be converted from fiat -&gt;BTC then BTC-&gt; fiat. PayPal is going to do this as there is no services existing that can disrupt Western Union and the banks at this point.

If demand goes up for bitcoin, then the price will go up. What's so hard to explain?
Also, using the blockchain requires small amounts of bitcoin. At least TX fees. If the network scaled up and became the store of records that it's been hyped to do. (Billions of tx a day). Then you will need bitcoin to use Bitcoin. 
Once again, demand will cause the price to go up.

Donate! Tip! Have some fun! Get obsessed with the technology and potential. THEN maybe buy a miner and mine for FUN. As a HOBBY! Because that's all it will be. Unless you can forge and bump out your own chips, build your own hardware, and run it with very cheap electricity and cooling, then you won't make a profit on mining. Also remember, ALL CLOUD MINING IS A SCAM! Oh, and have some fun please!

They can try but the brightest minds in tech want to work in disruptive technologies. They don't want to status quo. I work for an online publishing company in NYC and the competition for developer talent is astounding. They all want disruptive.
It won't take much to undermine monopolies and individual industries will fall one by one. Look how fast Netflix disrupted the entire rental business. How fast UBER is disrupting traditional taxi/limo services. Pharma sales people disrupted by digital marketing. Next is ISP disrupted by mesh networks. Cloud storage by Storj. It's happening everywhere. 
The thing that it so awesome is that none of these monopolies even have a chance. If they invest heavily in R&amp;D, they will basically cannibalize themselves.

You would think so. And if we see the dollar tanking, it will definitely boost the value of BTC. BUT, when the $USD is devalued, it will happen overnight, while everyone is sleeping. And it will be too late.

I wish I could read more quotes about bitcoin from these guys. Most traders and wall streeters honestly feel bitcoin is shit, has no future and is a horrible investment. That is has no chance and will be squashed. Even high ranking friends of mine, who own a few BTC, have no faith that it will succeed. They just bought a few "just in case."

They do have to pay taxes in $USD so I have no prob with Bitpay. It's such a security risk that none of these facilities can have a bank account. They have $30K a day in cash and no where to put it except a safe. Bitcoin to the rescue.

IMHO this proves that mining the coin, even with a slight loss, is the best way to obtain BTC. No banks involved, straight into your wallet. That is why people are obsessed with mining. Even if it's not profitable. It takes the banks out of the equation.

Why it's not a good idea? (Arguments I have heard).
Very difficult to get
Very NON-user friendly

Very volatile price
Scammers &amp; hackers everywhere
To easy to launder money
Can't pay anything without a internet connection. (Still need cash).
No central authority backs it
Mining to difficult/impossible
Centralization of mining can destroy network
No way to sue for theft

There is no "hot" wallet that is as safe as an offline wallet such as offline created paper key pairs or an offline Armory or equivalent. Just touching the live internet opens you up to theft. There is no 100% safe wallet but "hot" wallets should be thought of as the wallet you carry your license and spare cash in. You would never keep a lot in there. So NO, breadwallet is not secure enough to store larger sums. Same goes with Trezor, great for spending, but not trust-worthy yet for larger sums IMO.
@_date: 2014-01-14 14:25:02
No. You are not safe. No online wallet is safe. Nothing can stop a virus or malware key logger no matter how many passwords you have. And no cloud based server is safe either. The ONLY secure option is offline wallet generation and cold/paper storage. The private keys MUST be BIP0038 encrypted with a random pass phrase. Good luck!

Paper wallets have a MAJOR vulnerability. They must be swiped by an HOT machine. Be it a computer, mobile phone, trezor or such. All these devices are HOT devices and potentially subject to hackers. (Especially mobile phones and pc's). So offline wallets (Electrum, Armory, etc) used for cold storage and signing transactions, is BY FAR the safest. It's ok to keep smaller paper wallets around for quick swiping and spending. Which is what I do. But if I ever had to swipe a large amount of BTC from paper to a hot wallet, I would be nervous.

If you are using Coinbase and you don't have 2FA setup, then you are at risk on all fronts. 2FA protects you on all transactions and purchases. Mobile or web. ALSO, on your phone, you must have a 6 digit alphanumeric passcode that resets in 1-5 minutes of inactivity. No 4 digit numeric only codes. Whether you use bitcoin or not.

Have you ever heard of the concept of a "resource based" economy. People should buy what they need. Currently, the entire economy is based on debt slavery and the want/desire/greed to buy shit that we don't need. 
People will spend their currency when the value of their needs is more than the value of saving. Keep repeating to yourself "resource based economy" and you will get it. 
Bitcoin is not a flash in the pan idea, it's the pathway to a global restructuring to an economy that helps people and opens up opportunities. Price right now doesn't mean shit. The currency right now doesn't mean shit. As the blockchain is utilized more and more, the price will rise. 10-20 years and we will see the end of 99% of centralized services.
Patience and development will continue and the trollers will be silenced.

But you will also have to have them buy BTC so recipients in foreign countries can exchange for local currency, yes? Coinkite already does this but the spread is worse than Western Union. Need a business model that is within the ATM range of fees. (i.e. a few dollars or 1-2%)

Dogecoin has 1/3 the transaction volume of Bitcoin on average.  But the block conf time is 1/10 faster. Does that make it more useful? Probably not. But don't make it like Bitcoin is blowing everyone out of the water in volume. BTC, LTC and DOGE volume hasn't increase in a months. Fact is we won't know which network will be able to stand up to global volume (when it happens). No coin's code is close to perfect. And fixing things is very difficult and dangerous. So we'll just have to wait and see.

1. You should control your private keys and learn cold storage.
2. For the Coinbase multisig, you still need to store your part of the key. And that could:


3. Coinbase multisig requires creating your part of the key in the browser on a hot computer. Never use a hot computer to create your keys for cold storage, always offline. You computer could be compromised and at sometime in the future, your coins could be stolen.
4. Coinbase monitors transactions and could ban/block your account.
5. Coinbase is in fully compliance with FINCen and the NSA, etc. If ever, for any reason, the gubment wanted to confiscate bitcoins, yours would be surrendered. Even with multisig.
Any other questions as to why you should control your own money?
Get a trezor or learn cold storage please!

We will see this shift in business and government. It's many years away, but it will happen. May be on Bitcoin, or another block chain not yet invented. It's more than just money. The money pays for the fuel for the rocket. It's doesn't actually power the rocket.

Show me a way to tip someone without using dogetipbot or changetip on twitter, reddit or anywhere else without using a long annoying crypto address or the recipient having to setup a wallet. Users can post their address and I'll rain BTC and DOGE on them all day. DOGE users will get fractions of a penny and BTC users will get dollars. Which one would you rather get tipped with?
Tip bots are centralized but decentralized distributed services are in development for bitcoin using side chains and other tokens pegged to BTC price. I have been involved with Doge for a year and bitcoin for over 2 years. I have researched every aspect of crypto from tipping to smart contracts. Bitcoin can do it all and better.

Possibly it's the local bank. Some smaller banks use unique databases that could be outside their requirements for verification. Larger banks like Citi, Chase, HSBC are more easily verifyable.
Or the information could have a very slight type difference that causes a discrepancy. i.e. an old address, typo, or mistake on their part.
Check that your bank information on your statement perfectly matches your state ID's. They run cross checks.
Good luck.

I submitted this but posing here too:
Question: Can I use a BIP39 passphrase for cold storage?
If I:
1.    Download the source files from this page.  from here: 
2.    And generate my pass phrase on a 100% offline computer that has never touched the internet and has Ubuntu installed.
3.    Then store the recovery tool files on a few flash drives.
4.    Hand write the pass phrase and store safely.
5.    Then send funds to the first address.
Is it as secure as creating an offline paper wallet in an offline environment? Seems much easier and faster.

Most likely.
You can get convicted for either. Unlicensed MSB or dealing with "persons" engaged in illegal activity. The laws are vague and give a lot of leeway to prosecutors. 
"Oops, I didn't know he was a drug dealer." Not an excuse.
Why isn't there a U.S. based bitcoin exchange? There's e-trade, Ameritrade, etc. They require verification and follow regulations. Why are stocks different? 
Because for bitcoin there is no clear regulation and it could bury a bank. There is no insurance or protection. It's outside the realm of law.
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:34:25
"Why would I convernt my money to bitcoin to spend it on something, when I can already just use my money."
1. QE and inflation destroys savings in the long term.
2. Credit/debit card information is easily stolen. Although the blockchain is public, your personal information is not exposed.
3. Many businesses can't afford to or just can't accept credit/debit cards. The fees are too high. BTC payments processors solve this problem.
4. You can't make most international purchases with a debit/credit card easily. BTC solves that.
5. BTC is much faster than typing in all that information when purchasing digital goods online.
6. As a vendor, no chargebacks. Which is a huge problem with digital goods such as gift cards, xbox live memberships, etc.
Should I go on?
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:39:02




That is up to them. Bitpay says 50% of their vendors hold some portion of their receipts in bitcoin. It's not public info how much. Could be 1%-100%. As price goes up and stabilizes over the next few years, we will see more companies holding more and using it for B2B purchases.

Your argument is FUD and invalid. If the price reached an equilibrium where it's not profitable to mine, then people will stop mining. If it goes up, then miners will reactivate their hardware. There will be no attempted hostile mining takeover of the network if the price plunged. The network is too big and responsive.

Zooz coins are just tokens. Eventually you will be able to trade them for BTC. To use BTC for this would be too bloated to start. Just like Storj. Too many TX fees and slow conf time. Eventually it will use BTC or frictionlessly convert between the two. It's like when you go to the funpark and they give you tickets. It's more efficient and faster than paying $$$ for each ride. Digital tokens are the future and alt coins will be the dev gateways to build upon. Start small then scale up to BTC when it makes sense.

First things first. You should not use Coinbase for anything more than pocket money. $50-$100 worth. Use an HD wallet like Mycellium or breadwallet where u own the private keys.

I think that the 2.1 million club would be a great goal. (10 BTC). But that would be by 2140. Right now a little more than half of that should be a solid and affordable investment.
Most of my investor friends tend to think that you should buy 1-2 BTC to hedge against the future price rise. If it crashes, then you're out a few hundie. No worries.
AND, the ones who are currency traders are the most skeptical. I love discussing the future potential of the technology.

Anything to avoid taxation is against the law. 
I'm not sure how mixing helps you avoid taxation. Right now in the bitcoin realm, you must declare your profits voluntarily. There is no 1099 from Coinbase that will appear in your mail when you sold for a profit, if someone was lucky enough to do so.
I bought bitcoins from Coinbase and Circle and want to store them anonymously. In the future if I make money and spend them or cash them out, I will claim income and pay taxes. But until then, if they remain in secure cold storage, I don't owe any taxes. So what I am doing is 100% legal.

This article assumes a lot. I dont use the darknet for anything. I send random amounts to be mixed at random times and do random withdrawals over different time frames. I then condense a few random withdrawals and random amounts into various paper wallets at random amounts. No check in the blockchain can find any of that since the coins have been double, triple and quintuple mixed and re-joined at random times and amounts. I'm pretty sure about that. I just do it to have fully anonymous cold storage for the future when BTC hits high values and hackers and govts. start tracking people's wealth on the blockchain.

How do you encrypt a USB stick? Are you aware that USB sticks can have compromised firmware or be compromised? Better off printing BIP38 paper wallets with a non-wifi printer.


You still will need to use a hot computer to access/swipe your funds where they can be stolen. Using Armory or electrum offline, is safer as your funds stay offline and you sign transactions offline. You just need a hot wallet to broadcast the transaction.

As long as the data is hashed to the Bitcoin Blockchain OR as immutable. I see no need for other chains in the near future. Anyone of them could be taken out by a 51% attack any time. Their values are so low right now. Stick with the most proven and largest network, Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:47:37
A prominent bitcoin developer has labeled the currency a failed experiment, widening the rift over an arcane but critical technical issue that has divided the community for nearly a year.
“The fundamentals are broken, and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long-term trend should probably be downwards,” developer Mike Hearn wrote on the blogging platform Medium. “I will no longer be taking part in bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.”
The fight stems from growing congestion on the bitcoin network caused by size limits within the currency’s ledger of transactions. If the limits aren’t raised, the result could be debilitating bottlenecks. But fixing it requires altering a system that has been profitable for those that use heavy computer power to record transactions.
Mr. Hearn has been a vocal proponent for expanding the size limits. The problem is bitcoin is open-source software, so any change has to be approved a majority of the community, and it hasn’t been able to agree.
This isn’t the first time somebody has written bitcoin’s obituary. What is different is this obit was being written by a prominent insider, and it hit a raw nerve in the community. The price of bitcoin, which had been stable for months, dropped sharply, down 20% last week to $358. The price regained some ground over the weekend, and many are still defending the currency in the wake of Mr. Hearn’s comments.
“Bitcoin has long experienced extreme debates and misunderstandings,” said Sean Neville, the president of wallet-services startup Circle. “And it’s another misunderstanding that blockchain technology can fail simply because governance and technical debates grow more difficult as bitcoin matures.”
Bitcoin has always had a divisive edge. Believers laud it as a currency that is free from central banks and a transaction system that works outside the normal financial system. Skeptics see it as a kooky currency whose values soar and crash unpredictably, a casino for computer nerds. Governments can’t even agree whether it is a currency or a commodity.
The current split, however, undermines what many investors see as bitcoin’s most promising invention: the decentralized “blockchain” ledger for maintaining a record of who owns what.
Individual transactions are packaged into blocks and confirmed by a highly complex mathematical “race.” Winners of the race collect a newly minted bitcoin as a reward.
Bitcoin’s code limits the size of those blocks to one megabyte. Changing it requires consent from the so-called miners who have amassed the computing power to handle all the transactions. Mining already is so expensive that it takes company-sized investments to participate. Incumbents fear changing the size limit could affect their economics in unpredictable ways.
Not making a change has ramifications as well. Congestion is already creating long delays in confirming some transactions as the growing network bumps up against the size limit.
In August, Mr. Hearn and Gavin Andresen, one of bitcoin’s core developers, formally proposed raising the limit on the block size via an alternative version of bitcoin called Bitcoin XT, with higher size limits. This was an attempt at what is called in software circles a “hard fork”—creating a new version of a system that forces users to move to a new version.
The fight between backers of XT and the original version, now called Core, has been ugly. It has raged on Reddit and social media, users have been tossed off message boards, and there have been anonymous cyberattacks on users and companies. XT started off strongly, but hasn’t gotten near gaining a consensus for change.
This stalemate is what finally convinced Mr. Hearn that bitcoin was fatally collapsing in on itself. Others are more hopeful.
Yet another proposal, this one called Bitcoin Classic, has emerged from the ashes of the XT/Core debate. It is a version of bitcoin that would allow for a two-megabyte limit, with rules put in place to raise it over time. It appears to be quickly winning support.
“Sometimes it takes a crisis to get everyone in a room,” said Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, a venture-capital firm with bitcoin investments, in a philosophical blog post. “That may be how the block-size debate gets settled.”

VISA doesn't take a few seconds. The vendor doesn't receive the funds for days to weeks. Bitcoin processors settle at the end of each day. Bitpay also has zero fees. It makes its money from data and a tiny spread.
Bitcoin transactions are instantaneous. And ordering something online gives plenty of time for confirmations since it's being shipped.

I call BS right there. Coinbase controls the money not you. If he mentioned that he used cold storage or multsig vault then that's one thing. But he didn't talk about security at all. That's because Coinbase is the worst secure place to store. If any of his friends (or friends of friends) used any of those coins for lets say, porn, gambling, dark web, etc. He could get fired and his accounts frozen indefinitely. He never mentioned discounts like purse.io or giftcards at all. Which I'm sure he also uses on a regular basis.
Because...yes, this is an ad. I'm sure this kid uses many wallets and forms of storage. But he wouldn't talk about alternatives working at Coinbase, would he.

Transaction fees from the gazillions of Bitcoin transactions will provide a much better return than today's mining. Currently mining pools collect transaction fees and split them up with it's members just like the BTC from found blocks. We will see these fees begin to gain ground over the mined BTC in years to come as more and larger transactions take place.

That is the libertarian mantra behind bitcoin. Taxes can be collected many ways outside of income taxes. Which are inherently wrong. Property taxes, sales taxes, etc. People and even states are threatening not paying taxes because they strongly dislike our new govt. Most people avoid taxes every day and don't even try hard to do so. Paying in cash, winning cash, selling items for profit on eBay, etc. So your moral fiber is strong, and I respect that. But when a system is corrupt, isn't not participating in that system inherently a rebellious move? And when the richest pay the least % of taxes or close to none, the little guy gets the shaft. Doesn't that make you angry?

You may be right. But isn't the whole point of bitcoin to operate outside of govt control? If the system is corrupt and unfair, people are going to try and cheat. Gold, cash, tax havens, off-shore accounts, etc. We saw it with the Panama papers. The ultra rich are the biggest offenders. Did any of those people get brought to justice? Not saying it's right. I see post after post about how much money people made and how they paid off their student loans and are doing great btc they got in early. True or not, I doubt those people paid their taxes. I also see post after post about how the govt "legally" took people's cash and bitcoin could have saved them. Are you and your morally high horse also setting them straight?

The price of the token drives the power of the network. The higher the price, the more mining power chasing the rewards. Hence the network gets stronger and becomes even more immutable. To me, that is the strongest factor of the Bitcoin Blockchain.

I don't think you understand that if the value goes up at the same rate that it has been, the block rewards will still be very high when compared to fiat. The block reward even right now is more than when it was 50 BTC &amp; 25 BTC per block. The actual rewards MUST be much higher to sustain the growth of the network and support the ever increasing difficulty.

Can Coinbase take everyone's BCH after they withdraw BTC? (post-fork)
They said they wouldn't support BCH and then suppose you make a widthdrawl of BTC, wouldn't they still hold the private keys to the BCH. Legally, do they have to give you the BCH at some point? Asking for friends who bought a few at $500 a few years ago and just left it there. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:51:09
The trader has a $500 limit. There is usually no way for the bank to know who is depositing and what it's for. They probably use a different account for purchasing and exchange transfers. And who knows what their volume is. Could be low enough to not raise any flags.

Right. With zero fees it can be reverseable bc it won't get confirmed. That's why "most" wallets automatically include a fee so that can't "accidentally" happen. if you were sending me $5 million, you would include a proper fee and once confirmed, it would be practically unreversable without significant hash power and your own node. Such an important transaction may then take 30 mins for 3 confirmations and it's carved in stone.

This is where the security of Bitcoin is lost. A centralized server.
This is the most intriguing and the biggest problem to using the blockchain as a registry. You need to store data.
STORJ and distributed and encrypted cloud services would be best to store information like this. The power would be with the user.
Diamonds, houses or cars, this is needed to replace the antiquated parts of governments like property titles, land registries and DMV's.

What they want to do is use Bitcoin for very low cost with their own blockchains providing the secure cryptographic trading and then hashing the final trades to the blockchain. Their databases which will be private, will provide all the tools their clients need for quick settlements. The major benefit will be that their clients can prove ownership on the Bitcoin blockchain at any time. But the meat and bones they want to build will not be decentralized. So if their platforms take off, they will still be writing to the Bitcoin blockchain in very high volumes, which will cause upward pressure on the price.

That should bring in about $550 a month before electricity. (At current $7800 price) Elec will cost upward of $250 a month. Leaving approx $300 return per month. But then if you add in rising difficulty, making back your $2000 + 150 for PSU, ROI may happen after a year or longer.

Peernova is not a Bitcoin company, it's products are not immutable and not good for Bitcoin. They are a closed network just using blockchain tech and also partnering with Patrick Byrne on their side blockchain experimental market. (Which will fail).

First, there may not be a fork, at least not for a while. Also, best to break up your stash so just in case you need to swipe some funds, you don't have to expose the whole lot. If Bitcoin hits a million $, you don't want to swipe that much at once.
There are many ways you can use cold storage, but they all have the same recommended techniques. Create your private keys offline, encrypt them, and store safely.

Those are a paraphrase of Andreas A.'s words. But as I have learned over the past few years in Bitcoin, stay as far away from 3rd parties holding your coins, as much as possible. You can't avoid them completely, but you can do many things to minimize risk and maximize security. I am not in IT, code or program anything, but I employ the best security the Bitcoin ecosystem can provide. And I think that anyone who can use email and a mobile device can too.

The problem is there is no shortage. It's plentiful and easy to obtain for most. I have basic accounts at major vendors, so I pay close to exchange prices for instant buys. And if you're referring to the upcoming halvening next year, that will have no effect on price. It's already built in. I don't see a big pump for a while. BTC is best used as a means of transport and ease of exchange between fiats. It is also excellent for quick settlements for digital goods. But those markets are unregulated and not for the layman. It has not proven to be a good storage of value unless you got in early 2013 or before. When I need some, I buy it and use it. I keep a little on the side. I watch the feeds and markets very closely.

Near impossible? Not true. All my friends have wallets and online accounts and did not need any instruction from me.

Gold wont get up until the fragile U.S. economy is damaged by (soon to be) increased interest rates and increased inflation. The "printed" billions of dollars will rush back into the economy causing even more inflation. We will see the real estate and large cap markets drop causing a recession. Then they will QE again and make things even worse. Gold and BTC will flourish as long as there is access to it. We may even see capital controls that will effect every major market. By then, it will be too late.
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:51:03
What had their support said? The BTC should be released by the buyer or a few days after delivery. Message the seller to release the funds. That's how escrow works.
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:16:24


THE ANSWER IS NO. NO. NO. Private blockchains already exist. They are called ledgers, databases, cave walls, etc...
You can't have a distributed ledger without some form of incentive. A form of incentive that can't be tampered with without a consensus. That is what makes Bitcoin so strong. No single entity or minority of entities can change it.

SOOOOO glad I waited to dump my BCH. Patience paid off, it was hard not to dump at $600. Scored .25BTC per BCH. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:56:04
Ok. Aaron Voisine, creator of bitaddress.org and breadwallet feels the iOS is pretty secure. I trust his opinion too.
The problem I have with a Trezor is that you can't spend directly from it. You need to plug it into a USB port and use a web browser. I agree it's security is rock solid. Problem I have with CASE is the weird multisig setup they have and it looks awkward to carry around.
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:58:36
Just explain how regular money works first first. I explained to my ten year old that the Govt. can just print money and the banks can lend more than people deposit. Also that Bitcoin is a set amount that can't be changed unless everyone agrees. That it's more fair. Simple enough. We also bought stuff on purse.io together.

Can you tell that to every single independently owned retail store, shop, restaurant in NYC who pay exorbitant credit card fees. Because none take BTC, have heard of it, or have any idea. No mass adoption for a while. Or at least until there is an easy way for small merchants to accept it. The network couldn't even handle massive consumer purchases on a large scale. Trust me, no one wants this more than me. But this is our reality. The network is just not ready.

So you Coin join the funds and then have clean funds at an address. Then you spend some and the rest goes to a change address. Then you spend some more and the rest goes to a change address. Then you spend on BitPay or Coinbase or some major processor and the entire history is visible. Am I missing something? I don't see CoinJoin really helping the anonymity problem. Might as well use Bitcoin Fog for each transaction and send directly to addresses. A royal pain in the ass no matter what you use. Stealth Addresses is the only way to make this easier.

They will make mining universal with the initial devices being computer routers and other "hot" devices directly connected to the Internet. As a purchaser of said hardware, you will receive some bitcoin in exchange for a slightly higher elec bill but not to spend conventionally. The satoshi's created will be used to write to the blockchain. What will be written? Well using OP_RETURN the possibilities are endless. From insurance to property registration, micro finance, identity protection and more. They are working on disrupting the everyday status quo antiquated parts of our lives that bog us down and waste time and money. Much like Uber, Amazon and other not yet or recently profitable services, the value is all in the future potential. I have full faith that they will provide connections to legitimate services in the next few years.

If he was a competent business man he could have turned that exchange into a global Bitcoin company. But he was constantly resistant to outside consultation and investment.

Is this a wallet you access a lot or just once in a while? It's far from cold storage.
1. Flash drive could fail. 
2. Clean Windows installation - Fully updated regularly? If it has touched the internet, there is a chance of evil. 
3. VPN means nothing.
4. Don't need to back up Electrum folder if you safely store the recovery seed phrase.
You're better off creating sets of BIP38 paper wallets and loading them up. You can make backups since they're encrypted. Memorize and safely store the BIP38 passphrase. Carry some in your fiat wallet. Swipe into a moble wallet when need to reload funds.

I create paper wallets using Bitaddress.org files offline on a clean Linux Tails bootable USB using BIP38 to encrypt them. I'll make 7 at a time and keep the printout in my wallet for easy swiping into my Breadwallet. Never more than a few Bitcoin per address. I also keep copies as backups. I feel safe as BIP38 is some fine encryption and very difficult to crack as proven in this subreddit many times. Would take a global botnet years to crack a 20 character alphanumeric BIP38 passphrase. I memorize it and also keep a backup of that in a separate place.

For pocket money (under $1000 worth of BTC), you can use a mobile wallet such as Bread, CoPay or Mycelium. Just make sure to write down your backup phrase and store safely and redundantly.
If you have larger holdings, order a Trezor, the classic one, not the new color one. You'll get it faster. Then learn all the in's and out's of the Trezor. Read up. Test and practice. It's the safest and best hardware wallet out there in my opinion. A Ledger is also good I hear, but I don't own one. Good luck!

I hope there isn't a rally, pump, dump, bubble, etc for a while. I hope that the hundreds of millions in VC funding produce great products for consumers.

Oh boy. Don't use that. It's known to run bad code. Use a HD wallet on your mobile device or Electrum on your computer.

Just about everyone using HD wallets and never reusing addresses does show as more transactions. Every tie you spend with an HD wallet, there are two outputs.

If you use bitaddress.org you have to hash it to check that you downloaded the source files without any tampering.
Then run offline and use BIP38 encryption. Save as a PDF and put on a USB stick to print. The paper wallet can be exposed because the private key is encrypted. Make sure you use a long and unque BIP38 passphrase and store it safely and separately from the paper wallet.
And make sure you can create them and swipe them easily. Use small amounts at first.

The truth is, bitcoin will take over in Venezuela slowly as there is no way to pay for anything there. There isn't enough cash in circulation. You can't even go to a restaurant. The only people who can spend there are those with bank accounts who can wire money to stores and restaurants. There's very few of them and they also have to pay fees. It's a dire situation. Bitcoin will be used by necessity because that's all there may be for some people. The younger generation will crack on to this and within 10 years, there should be a blooming bitcoin economy. 
Don't think the dollar can save people here. There's not enough paper dollars in circulation even in the US to help Venezuela. And don't expect Drump to airlift pallets of cash over to help them out.

Trezor is open source. You could download the source code and build your own with a breadbox and $25 worth of parts. 
The Trezor signs the transaction offline (in the device) and only send the completed transaction back to the wallet software to transmit to the network. The private keys are never exposed.
An offline, open source linux distro, with electrum, such as Tails, is also very secure. As long as you verify the distro and check the hashed signature from the source. (Tails also has a browser plugin that can do this for you). But the Trezor has less friction because you can use it safely on any computer (even if infected with a virus) and not have to boot off a USB stick every time you want to send funds. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:55:29

With Authy you can recover. You MUST set a recovery password for best security (not required, but should be) - Store it in a safe place offline. You can restore to your phone or a new one after reinstalling the app but you must have the password. That is the protection from # spoofing. It takes 24-48 hours to recover. So just in case someone is trying to jack your account, you will get notified if it's not you. A great system and works well. Not for the newbie users though. But neither is Bitcoin.

In all those cases multisig will work perfectly. Automated trading is off the blockchain and up to the exchange to manage properly. Actual deposits and withdrawals can easily be multisig so exchanges can't run away with your money. Margins, puts, calls, derivatives, loans should be multisig by default for actual bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. 
The problem with all of this is that you are still dealing with an exchange that is centralized. Development into distributed exchanges is growing and multisig trading with multisig escrow deposit gateways such as BTM's and local nodes will lead the way in coming years.

Because people have been using proper wallets for a while now. So you can't say it's just change addresses. Because they have been in effect for over a year. Mycelium, Breadwallet, Electrum, Armory, etc. I dont' think you can attribute change address causing an artifical spike in TX to web wallets like Coinbase, Circle, Blockchain, etc.

This is stupid and has been addressed many times. It is up to the consumer to report any gains on BTC. No state can automatically take this because they don't know how much you bought it for. And what about losses? If you bought at $1000 and bought a coffee at $235, then the state may owe you money for taking a loss. Works both ways. And it's up to the consumer to track all their purchases and report profits.

Yeah. One of those. But more secure, encrypted, distributed, etc. Suppose you created an app that runs on smartphones to be a concert/sport ticket distribution blockchain.

Well written and many valid points. Mining will become more and more centralized, but the point is that the algorithm is fully inspectable. Any changes are easily detected and debated first.

Might as well use my bank debit card and skip all the in between business. Please give me one reason to go against my best judgement, take extra steps to spend my money, and get no cost savings. (Not including a rare timely price spike).

The only loss is TX fees (pennies) and now the potentially (bad) coin is mixed into everyone's stash. So do you ban all the coins? What about exchanges with hot wallets, thousands of coins go through those addresses a day. Impossible to trace. Seriously.

Until we see significant delays in the mempool, fees go up, and other bottlenecks, we won't see a block size change or sidechains pegged to BTC. Change tip is already a sidechain.

Security Service of Ukraine: Bitcoin is used to finance the separatist
Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) Valentyn Nalyvaychenko said that the Security Service and SCFM will block Bitcoin account separatists.
In the first place, he said, will focus on cards and bank accounts, but Bitcoin was also listed among the payment instruments subject to control.
"Another aspect of the joint work of the SBU and SCFM, too - Ministry of Internal Affairs, where necessary - the blocking of accounts, cards, a variety of" Bitcoin "and so on, where the separatists are trying to throw money," - said Valentin Nalyvaychenko.
How will the blocking of data Bitcoin accounts, Nalivaychenko not explained.
Due to the protracted military conflict in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of Ukraine, the country's economy is in an unstable state. Infrastructure in these regions during the conflict, seriously affected. According to our information, cashing in the area of ​​the ATO is carried out mainly through intermediaries in special exchange offices.

Sorry but your point is moot. Bitcoin, in its current state, should not be used by people who aren't tech savvy or learn how to use and store it properly. Using an iOS device and turning on Airline mode is not safe or secure for longterm cold storage. The new users shouldn't even consider cold storage and just buy some for basic spending and use. 
Anyone who attempts to put away thousands of dollars in Bitcoin cold storage better know how to use it inside and out. Even the experts from Andreas to Gavin and others have repeatedly said that Bitcoin is not ready for the masses.

Not necessarily. If you're logged in (or not logged in and cookied), what you read and comment on and what you say is still run through bloom filters and it's easy to figure out what you like. Even with blocking ads you're still profiled and targeted. Ever make a purchase online when logged into (or cookied) by any site? All that data is analyzed. Contextual ads can still find you on eBay, Amazon, social, etc. Your identity is hashed so that also allows very granular targeting and safety. How else should Reddit make money?

I can't say that BTC is better or faster now. But it will be. 
As far as the Wifi or roaming issues, just travel with encrypted paper wallets just traveler checks. Vendors who could take a travelers check, could take a paper wallet and give you change in BTC or local currency. Extremely easy to work with. That is the best way to store BTC overall and you just swipe funds to your phone's hot wallet as needed. 
Payment processing is not there yet, but it will be in the next 5-10 years as companies easily work BTC into their networks. We're seeing it with STRIPE, Braintree, and many others.
As far as Schwab, they aren't known to be the cheapest but if you're a regular trader, Ameritrade is much more reasonable.

Your Windows/Mac system can be too easily compromised with all your surfing on the clearnet. Do you run javascript at all? Watch Youtube videos? Download anything? 99% of "hot" systems are compromised with something. And that's not a conspiracy theory, that's a fact. So keeping a wallet on your "hot" clearnet desktop is a risk, even if you only connect the wallet through TOR. Even if you encrypt everything, there's no proof there isn't a hidden keylogger or screen shot malware.
Follow best practices:
1. Keep a majority of your funds in cold storage. Either an offline wallet with a nice long passphrase, BIP38 paper wallet, etc. 
2. Use Tails/TOR/Electrum for your "hot" tx for best anonymity. Just boot off a USB, takes a minutes. I also use iOS breadwallet for tx like paying bills, donating, etc. Things I don't care if they are tracked.
3. Also, people sometimes like to talk a lot. So if you want to stay anonymous, follow Fight Club rules about what you don't want public.
Best of luck to you.

Do not mess around with all the new services. Bitcoin is not intended to be interest bearing. Hold and store your coins safely in offlince generated addresses and come along for the ride.

Since they could consider anyone a terror suspect, we need to be very careful with our coins and use all legal means necessary to tumble them and protect our identities.

That has nothing to do with blockchain technology. That is the algorithm on how bitcoins are created (little b) and is unique to bitcoin. Alternate blockchains use many various algorithms with many various supply schedules. Some with unlimited supply (constant mining rewards, such as Dogecoin). 
Now without unleashing Altcoin hate, they demonstrate that the blockchain (the database) and the algorithm that controls rewards can be completely customized based on need. And changed any time along the way with a consensus.
A fully distributed and open decentralized ledger is the point you make that hits home the most.
I hope we see blockchains used to "lighten up" all the heavy bureaucracies that are ingrained in our local and federal governments such as property titles, DMV's, voting, taxes, etc. I was watching a recent video by one of the founders of 21 where he said that Silicon Valley will be responsible for massive unemployment when legacy workers are replaced by computers. I agree, so I'm already teaching my kids as much about computers that I can...

Two years ago, I convinced 10 successful guys to invest in Bitcoin mining with me. We pre-ordered a 4.5TH KnC Neptune for $13,000. We were Batch 1. Miner didn't come and LUCKILY got a refund 5 months later (in bitcoin). So now they all own some Bitcoin. I think we were refunded when the price was $535 so they only lost 1/2 their money. But they are HODLing and not mad at me...which is nice.

Another way would be to also load tails on a usb, and boot it.
DONT connect to the Internet. Don't run any persistence.
Run electrum (included in Tails) and write down seed and store safely. It will warn you that persistence is off and you can lose you funds (if you lose your seed).
Electrum will create a few public addresses for you. You can easily create a few more.
Load up those public addresses with funds.
Anytime you need access to them, just boot Tails, run Electrum and enter seed. You can swipe the funds to a new wallet or mobile one easily and never have to go online.
Pretty nifty.

Do you mean is this possible now or with smart contracts/wallets?
You could create a wallet that is restricted to certain types of payments to a master public address. That master public address could be owned by a food purveyor or shelter or any business. That way you could donate funds and make sure they are only used where intended.
This is the future of electronic programmable payments. Controlled expenditures would virtually eliminate the chance of corruption and misbehavior. Imagine you could donate to charity and then see exactly where your money went and where it was intended to be spent. Or public funds set to build a bride went only to that project and not into something unauthorized.

Does the Trezor server log balances? You public keys are sent for balances and could be read and tracked. No private keys are sent, but those aren't needed for balances.
So I would switch to Tails and create a new Electrum/Trezor wallet for the most secure anonymity. Also, put some random amounts though a mixer so they can't be tracked to the new wallet. But remember, all tx in a wallet including change addresses, etc can be tracked. But with Tails you will have the most protection.

Just BIP0038 encrypt your paperwallets with a strong passphrase. You can then print them safely. I use 10-12 character base 56 passhrases and just keep them in a few safe places.

The almost perfectness of the Bictoin scenario is that a large pool operator or larger owner of hardware has invested so much money into their equipment that disrupting the blockchain in anyway will result in a loss to them. (And everyone else). A few double spends is not worth it. And if somehow, it is leaked or discovered that there is a player with control of a large majority of the hashrate, the community will speak out if there is any chance of maleficence. It's a self correcting system. Just like the US was intended to be, before banksters and politicians screwed it up.

He was a part of the Second Market deal. They don't want to use the Bitcoin blockchain because, according to them, it could go to zero at any moment and that's not a risk they are prepared to take. Upgrading their data structure and having buzzwords to sell it to customers will grow their business. They are seriously upgrading the private equity market, which is way overdue, but there are no plans to use Bitcoin, it's blockchain or use the currency in any way. I told my friend that they are making a huge mistake and made him a gentlemens bet that they will wake up and be trading on the Bitcoin blockchain by 2018 or sooner.

My highest level of convenient security:
1. Create a Tails boot USB (sign and verify).
2. Download bitaddress.org Github files (sign and verify).
3. Create persistent volume in Tails (with encryption password) and copy on signed bitaddress.org files.
4. Staying offline, create a bunch of paper wallets with bitaddress.org (BIP38 encrypted). And then save those files as PDF's on another USB for printing or storage. (Keep the BIP0038 passphrase separate and also memorize it. You can use the same secret phrase for a bunch of paper wallets).
5. Run Electrum on Tails and use for any day to day spending. (Not bulk storage)
6. Install a mobile wallet like breadwallet for any mobile day to day spending.
7. Print the BIP0038 encrypted paper wallets you made and load with the bulk of your funds. I use .1 to .5 denominations for each PW.
8. You can now carry (a copy) of a few of the BIP0038 paper wallets in your real fiat wallet if you like. They can't be stolen if found because they are encrypted but you can swipe them with breadwallet if you need to reload on the fly.
Back up all your passphrases on paper, handwritten in pen, in a plastic bag and stored in a few very secure places like hiding spots in your house, parents house, etc.
Live safely and happily.

He is in a dying industry. It will be completely disrupted by blockchain technology. The entire concept of ownership of a house can be simplified to a string of letters and numbers. Soon will be gone the $10K closing costs and obsurd banking and registration fees that rape consumers. 
Want to help him change the world? Draw out new model for ownership using a colored bitcoin token as an example. Lets call it housecoin. With a 2c transaction, you can write your ownership of something to the blockchain. POOF. You own the house. With that digital token, you can prove ownership. The information stored is just numbers. Numbers that identify everything that is needed about that house. Deed, title, etc. Oh, and those are digital tokens too. Get where this is going? All that paperwork doesn't need to exist privately. It can exist publicly and with complete anonymity. Pretty crazy. Sorry if your mind just exploded.
AND mortgages will be replaced with micro-financing and micro-insurance. Imagine 1,000,000 people all invested $10 into a mortgage pool. And smart contracts were created to be able to lend it out. The possibilities are endless. Gone will be the banks, mortgage houses and centralized institutions and their irresponsible practices.

So you are betting that the bitcoin ETF will be on a fraction reserve to the actual holdings? Like the SCAM gold ETF? NOT A CHANCE. All BTC ETF funds will be 100% verifiable on the blockchain at any time. That is why the SEC denied the first attempt. Because the liquidity of the asset was not secure enough for them. (Exchanges).

I like to print BIP38 pw's and carry them around with me in my wallet. (I memorize my BIP38 passphrases as well as keep them stored safely). Need some funds? Swipe a paper wallet directly into my mobile and enter passphrase. For long term cold storage, the seed phrases are fine.
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:03:24
Get a verified copy of TAILS and setup a boot USB. Then copy on the Github files from bitaddress.org. Really easy to use and very safe. If you want to use your home printer for paper wallets, only use hard wired connections, not wireless. Select paper wallet tab and make sure to use BIP38 encryption on your paper wallets.
The AMAZING thing about BIP38 paper wallets is that you can make multiple copies and store them in multiple locations. (Store the BIP38 passphrase seperately or memorize it). One location can safely be your regular $USD wallet. If for some reason you needed the funds, you, and only you, could swipe them into breadwallet, mycelium or any other good HD wallet for immediate use. 
You're on the road to setting yourself free.

Create a Bitcoin cellphone re-charge station, make it a certain fee for an amount of time. I.e. .01 BTC for 10 minutes, etc. That would be easier than measuring the outputted wattage and charging by that. Users would have to pay upfront, plug their phone in and the power will kick off when the timer runs out. The arduino can just turn on/off power source and show a timer.
Would also be great for secure wifi access. Pay BTC and it will send you an email with a password to access. Could all be done via a simple wifi server like you see at airports.
Basically any device that takes change, should take BTC instead.

Sidechains still need to interact with the main blockchain. No bank is going to just trust her when she waves her hand and says her "colored satoshi's" are now worth $1 billion.

I have been reading about how a user, for example a charity or org, can post a public key (or BIP39 style  phrase) that anyone can use to create an endless amount of public keys so that anonymity is protected and TX can't be followed. 
Right now, if an org wants to accept donations directly and posts a public key, that key will show all the TX. Some orgs don't want that to be so public.
I am not a techie so would need this to be easy to use and am wondering how soon until anyone can use this.

With the BTC price severely undervalued right now, you should buy as much BTC as possible RIGHT NOW and put it in COLD STORAGE. I guarantee you that will make you more money. Guaranteed.

The consumer rewards program is a scam. You pay for those so called "rewards" with:
1. A yearly fee. (Which they just raised BTW).
2. Increased costs of services that vendors you buy from have to work into their pricing to cover AMEX fees and chargebacks. So YOU pay more for items and then get cash back. It's in their favor, trust me.
Purchase protection can come in handy if something is accidentally damaged or stolen. But honestly, Amex still makes a profit on providing those services due to their high fees. If they didn't they wouldn't offer it. Quite a smart business model IMO.
You wouldn't transact with a shady business if you knew that you were responsible if you got ripped off. People need to be more discerning and responsible with who they transact with.

Dude, you have no idea what you're talking about. Coin mixing, tumbling, coin-joining, Stealth addresses and other systems are very effective and only getting better. It's not user friendly yet, but it will be baked into wallets in the next few years. I play around on bitcoin fog and test the "taint analysis" and it works flawlessly. So your alt-coins can die now, Bitcoin can do it all. 
Lets say 1000 of us all deposit into a multisig escrow address. Then 1000 others deposit into another address. The coins are "mixed". Then beef up security by swaping the accounts and the coins are now clean. No way to trace. And that's the simplest form of mixing. Actual services are much more complex.

You don't indicate which type of wallet you were using or which type of phone you had. If you were using Mycelium, breadwallet or any other HD wallet, it prompts you multiple times to write down your passphrase and store safely.

I disagree. With trusted nodes and BTM's and vendors providing the fiat deposits and withdrawals, there definitely could be a decentralized exchange. Soon there will be millions of places to buy and sell bitcoin. Trustless p2p trading can then exist on the blockchain with payment channels, multi-output transactions and potentially, sidechains. So I think he is wrong. It is possible and if an incentive to participate is offered, (like BTM fees), it can exist.

Hacked data, skimmed payment terminals and stolen identities. Not easy for vendors to get payment terminals due to upfront costs and KYC/AML regulations. Vendors don't get paid for 2-4 days after purchases. Funds can be seized, frozen or confiscated by govt.

Here is a smart contract: a bet. 
You and I agree to wager .01 BTC on a Giants game. We select oracles to verify the results of the game. Let's say ESPN, NBC, &amp; ABC. We set the terms and the code for the agreement is approved and hashed to the bitcoin Blockchain in a micro transaction using the OP_RETURN field. If 1 character of the code is changed, it will nullify since it doesn't match the OP_RETURN field.
The funds that we bet are set in a multisig transaction of 2/3. With the oracle being the third signor. 
The game happens, the score is verified, and the winner gets the prize. All automatically.
Here's another: a car payment
Your $ must be paid to an address by a certain date or your car will not start.
One more: A contract with an attorney
The attorney must complete certain verifiable tasks such as filing paperwork with the govt. Meeting deadlines, appearing in court, etc. as long as a trusted set of oracles can verify things, the payments will be made to the attorney.
Pretty much ANY stock trade or financial derivative could be a smart contract. In fact you could remove an ENTIRE sector of the finance industry with robots.
Biggest industries ripe for disruption:
Finance. Clearing houses, exchanges
Govt agencies. DMV, permits, municipalities, tax collection

Many users use a VPN, TOR, HD wallets, mixers such as bitcoinfog to clean coins history (or dirty it up more like), Tails and other anonymizing software.
If you're under investigation or surveillance, they may be able to track you if you aren't careful. (DPR). But even a non-techy user can cover their tracks pretty easily using standard services.
I would agree that cash is the dirtiest and most widely used for crime, but just like bitcoin is great for general users, it's also great for criminals.
Some one could have $10 million in BTC randomly spread in 500 addresses managed by 1 HD wallet that is accessible from any device using a 12 word passphrase. So I think your argument is kind of moot.

I would like to see them call in gold ETF's. I call bs. All the kershuffling of so called "reserves" couldn't be fully verified. If they called them in, there would be huge defaults of funds and the price would skyrocket to where it's supposed to be.
But with bitcoin, we will be watching closely. Most ETF's are a ponzi and run on fractional reserve. This could be disastrous.

Off chain has many advantages and disadvantages. Faster Rx and no network fees, but also centralized and outside the security of Bitcoin. All exchanges use off-chain tx. Hence, they are easily hackable. But off-chain can support massive volume.

This is being worked on with stealth addresses and master public keys where you can create new addresses for users and they hold the associated private keys. We are a year or two away from this being implemented into a wallet app. It's a huge privacy booster so people can post static addresses but new ones are made to protect privacy.
You shouldn't re-use addresses obviously. But if you really wanted to do this. Just use a QR code scanner app and then just keep pasting in the address every time you wanted to send funds. But like I said, it's not recommended.

I had a similar problem because I had a few different breadwallets and recovery phrases. Did you ever restart your wallet? Could you have an additional recovery phrase? I phreaked out as well and then tried them all and when I saw the one syncing and recovering transactions that I knew were connected to the wallet with my funds, I knew it was the right one. And then I ordered a Trezor. ��

This is true for many apps. I have found that blocked ports are usually to prevent large data transfers like downloading and steaming that put a drain on the network. But with a phone based connection, not an issue.
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:42:11
Not with breadwallet or any local wallet that uses AES encryption on an iPhone. Everything is done on the phone and the TX is just broadcasted. Just because they can read texts and see where you are, doesn't mean they have full access to your phone. 
But use a mobile VPN if you want to stay outside the "stingray's" sniffers.

If you use bitaddress.org to create BIP38 encrypted paper wallets, the actual private keys are never exposed. Just the encrypted private keys. So you can have no fear printing anywhere as long as your BIP38 passphrase is long and unique. BIP38 uses a scrypt algo so it's very intensive and time consuming to attempt brute force attacks. Which have been proven pointless, even by large bot nets and GPU clusters.

Yes agree. Do we agree that a decentralized and distributed blockchain (database) representing a token (currency, stocks, etc) is not possible without a tangible reward for mining (call it what you will, processing transactions, etc.) ?
So if there is a new blockchain created for concert tickets, and the reward for mining that blockchain are tokens that can be used towards concert tickets, that is the only way it would work?
There must always be some reward, and that reward could be anything that a user deems tangible.

It's easy! Download the Bitaddress.org zip file from github and make some "sloppy" paper wallets. Practice using a few pennies for each. Experiment with BIP0038 encrypted private keys too.

You sent coins to someone who spent them on either the Dark Web, Gambling site or a suspicious address. With Coinbase, it's 8 degrees of separation. So you are responsible for all your friends and their friends actions and so on, and so on, and so on.

In 2-3 years with steady growth? Nothing. The VC money is still pouring in. The price will go up as usage and acceptance increases. Also when someone figures out how to disrupt banking, property and insurance with legal and easily useable services.
I see a future with the end of wasteful govt services like the DMV, property registries, citizenship, voting, etc. All will soon be on the blockchain, secure, and easily verifiable. The act of using these services will go the way of the rotary phone and TV bunny ears. Someone may still use them, but only if they have to.

Yes, it is possible. Remember the ebay app is just like using a web browser, it's just a front end for the same server based tools you would use on the web.

I think taking something like using breadwallet's HD software and forking that into a P2P commerce solution would be amazing. Multisig escrow and meshnet (bluetooth) capability. That could be amazing for flea markets or location based buying and selling of items. Go for it! Forget using an API. Let the user be in control of their funds in the app. It's like a HD wallet on steroids.

It's not a scam directly. It's a scam because the products and services you buy have inflated prices that cover those replacements. So you're paying for it over the long term. I hope you don't float a balance or ever pay late. I'm sure you don't.


What am I not documenting? You can clearly see the fees in my post. Those fees cover costs of operating the business, as well as other sources of income from interest, etc.


That's what is wrong with our society. Everyone loses except for the CC company when using credit.


I have shown you that there are no net rewards, you pay for them in the fees that merchants have to add into their prices to cover what AMEX sucks from them.

If you are using a newer open-source HD wallet on iOS like Breadwallet or Mycelium, there haven't been any reported thefts. So you should be ok. But make sure you use all the security you can and have full passcode on your phone and on the app. 
Making a few offline BIP38 paper wallets woulnd't hurt. If you use a good BIP38 passphrase you can carry copies of the paper wallets in your fiat wallet. No one can steal the funds without your BIP38 passphrase and you can easily swipe the funds into your hot wallet if you need them. Much safer that way. Colder the better.

Create an HD wallet ie Breadwallet or Mycellium. Write down the paraphrase, laminate, seal it safely in an envelope and store with your will in a safety deposit box. You can use the same passphrase as your regular wallet if you want as HD wallets can produce millions of key pairs. And Breadwallet/Mycellium are as safe as a Trezor. If something happens to you, they can recover all the funds instantly by entering the passphrase. 
This is the best way as it eliminates any chance of any lost bitcoin.

No blockchain can exist without a currency. It's just a database. Anyone can host a database. Without proof-of-work and mining rewards, there will be no incentive and no distribution and no security. 
How can they possibly predict future technological innovation? It's just speculation, and that has no place in public policy making.

If you are involved in a new technology, and that technology isn't disruptive, then you are not involved with the right one. The goal of Bitcoin is to provide the worlds citizens with the freedom to control their own money. This will take time. There is no rush to push Bitcoin as a new global standard. Lets give it 5, 10, maybe 20 more years. Banks control our money, our businesses, our government and basically, us. They will not concede, they must be forcibly removed, discredited and abolished. We can help this happen by educating ourselves, families, friends, strangers, and anyone else who will listen. I know for a fact that I have influenced over 100 people by discussing Bitcoin. You do the same, on a regular basis, and you will see the world change around you to a place of hope.

I expected Bitcoin to reach $300 by EOY 2013. And would have been very happy with that. The fact that it's around $850 dumfounds me. It is over valued for something that doesn't have much utility. The greatest is for international transfers. That is where we may see banks start using them.

If you look at brick and mortar indicators, things are much worse than they seem. Major cities have huge swaths of vacant storefronts. Including NYC which usually has waiting lists for prime storefront property. The retail businesses are failing, replaced by online businesses with much lower prices and overhead. Real estate is being gobbled up by foreign investors as a store of value. Most new high-rises in major cities are mostly vacant with off-shore money holding up and keeping the prices extremely inflated. When real estate crashes (again), that will correct most other markets and cause a domino effect. Best bets are crypto, companies that sell essentials (discount food, clothing) and hard assets like gold and art.

Mortgage rates would be based on property value. Over time, the value of the house would appear to deflate due to the value being less and less BTC over time.

Your answer should have been the standard elevator pitch I have been using for months: "Who created Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called "crypto-currency", which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than a central authority. The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi left the project in late 2010 without revealing much about himself. The community has since grown exponentially with many developers working on Bitcoin.**Satoshi's anonymity often raised unjustified concerns, many of which are linked to misunderstanding of the open-source nature of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol and software are published openly and any developer around the world can review the code or make their own modified version of the Bitcoin software. Just like current developers, Satoshi's influence was limited to the changes he made being adopted by others and therefore he did not control Bitcoin. As such, the identity of Bitcoin's inventor is probably as relevant today as the identity of the person who invented paper."**

None of these factors are risks.
1. If miners drop out the difficulty will drop and then it will draw them back.
2. The blockchain archives old transactions. Didn't you read the white paper?
3. Transaction fees will replace block rewards before that.
4. No govt. can ever stop decentralized networks. If they could, there would be no botnets or torrent networks.
So basically none of these arguements are reason to worry.

I get the point of your story. I guess I am trying to come up with the best storage solution for myself. I could go all paper wallets and just refill my cloud wallet occasionally when I want to spend. Or I could setup this offline machine and use it for signing transactions. In that case, I would like to get it to the highest level of security. This is not due to any fear now, but what if BTC really gains a lot of value? I would like to feel secure that my money is safe and consult those around me with the safest possible practices as well.

With each country that builds Bitcoin momentum, we see a surge in price and volume. Pretty amazing.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:37:42
YES! That is the best way to go. It's called "dollar cost averaging." But remember that Coinbase only allows buys of a minimum of .1 BTC. So your $50 wont process after the price crosses $500. So better to set as $100 every two weeks. Good luck. (And don't forget to transfer your BTC out of Coinbase periodically). Oh, and don't use Coinbase paper wallets, create your own on an offline computer.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:13:17
Bitcoin is a pure (monetary) deflationary currency because it's supply is fixed. And your attached chart is IMO wrong and of Bernake and the criminal banksters of modern history. I quote Jorg Guido Hulsmann's book "The Ethics of Money Porduction," p.66: "...deflation has no clear negative impact on aggregate production. Long-term decreases of the price level did not systematically correlate with lower growth rates than those that prevailed in comparable periods and/or countries with increasing price levels. Even if we focus on deflationary shocks emanating from the financial system, empirical evidence does NOT seem to warrant the general claim that deflation impairs long-run growth."

Coinbase pays just fine and the small % that they charge is well worth the convenience. But for best practice it's VERY advisable to speak to your accountant first so you put away the proper amount for taxes. Remember that bank accounts and mortgage companies are entrenched with IRS trackers. Follow compliance. If you go to China you will most likely get arrested and or be stuck with a boat load of Yuan. Then what? It's illegal to convert it to $USD and if it's in cash, you will have to declare and explain yourself to US customs. You will also pay commissions anywhere else you try to exchange them.

Find an old computer and format it. Turn off wireless in your house. Install Ubuntu from a DVD. Copy the Github files for bitaddress.org wallet generator via DVD as well. Glue gun ethernet ports, USB ports. Turn off wireless in Ubuntu. Encrypt home folder &amp; password protect system. Use bitaddress.org, paper wallet tab. Check off BIP0038 Encrypt. Create wallets using long passphrases about 20 digits long with upper/lower case and numbers. I roll different types of dice, cards to create my passphrases. Numbered dice, colored dice, shuffle and pick cards, etc. Write down your finished wallet info. DON'T PRINT IT. Write down your public key, encrypted private key on a piece of paper. Write down your passphrase on a different piece of paper. Keep them safe and separate. Maybe even etch them in metal. This is the best security I know.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:17:49
Create a wallet at blockchain.info. You can import your encrypted private key and then in asks you for the password (passphrase). Then you can import the BTC. PLEASE test this with a SMALL amount of BTC first to get the hang of it. Only import a private key ONCE and for the FULL amount. Make new wallets for future storage. GOOD LUCK.

Agree to all of it. But the essence of a free market is rearing it's ugly head. Digital currency has such a high utility that as it's price increases, that utility grows. How is Bitcoin supposed to function as a means for large international wire transfers, when it is so hard just to acquire a million dollars worth? The value must rise dramatically for it to operate on a large scale. And that will take a few years of rough price cycles to take place.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:47:41
I'm curious where most of the buys are coming from in China. If they are from exchanges, then it can't be money laundering because it's traceable. If its from individuals and miners and bought with cash, then there could be an issues. But that wouldn't be just in China. If I had $7000 in illegal cash, I would buy a KNC Jupiter miner off Craigslist for cash and make 90c on the dollar. Or just find local sellers willing to trade for cash.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:05:35
You need to create a different private key for each transaction. The private key/QR code has the amount it's worth built in. It's like printing your own money. You can't put a $100 bill on the wall and ask everyone to rip off a piece worth a $1.

SEMI-MORONIC POST.
Can a mining pool control all of it's workers and fork Bitcoin if it gains a 51% share? 
If so, then the very small senior staff of GHash.IO and BTCGuild, could VERY EASILY collude, fork, create millions of BTC, cash out very quickly, and disappear. 
What is stopping them from doing this? And how could we prevent this? There are no laws in the Bitcoin world that prevent mining pool monopolies.

1 BTC per wallet max! Use only OFFLINE never been connected to the internet computers as wallet generators. Install Linux on a piece of crap old PC and put the html files on a usb stick to copy on.

Go in your closet and resurrect an old machine. It's as green as green gets. Try what I did. What I forgot to mention is I used the bitaddress.org downloaded files to make the wallets. The only vulnerability is that the USB ports still work. But I re-format any usb ticks I use often. The only software I've installed is bitaddress.org and simple printer drivers. Actually, I'm not printing my paper wallets anymore, just writing down the public addresses and encrypted private keys. Then on a separate sheet, the pass phrases. Try it!
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:40:04
Make sure you test a BIP0038 paper wallet with a small transaction to get the hang of it. I use bitaddress.org as well on an offline computer to create and then to cash them in, I use my blockchain.info wallet. There is a tab to import a private key, then it will prompt you for the password, then voila! Pretty cool. Also, MARE SURE you use a very random passphrase. I use dice, colored dice, playing cards and coin flips. Store private keys in a very safe place away from the paper wallets. Good luck! A good passphrase would look like this: 4j6KgJ8vI2h35n6reO31Qmc15t32ROzINn

He forgot to mention that 99% of businesses receiving Bitcoin just use Bitpay or equivalent and convert to cash. What could kill Bitcoin? The reliance on the $USD. Until you can pay for goods, services, supplies, electricity, gas, salaries, and most everything else with Bitcoin, it's utility is that to gold. A store of value. And that is not the goal here. We need more adoption for it to succeed.

I think this is why I got into Bitcoin in the beginning. All signs point towards a meltdown. Whether in 2014, 2017 or 2020. The argument against your theory is that China holds a lot of U.S. debt. And devaluing the U.S. Dollar will devalue the debt. Dollar devaluation is bad for creditors as paying them back becomes cheaper. There is a big stack of bad debt and that can come crashing down at any moment. But there many large players that will not let that happen anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:36:29
Maybe at some point, close to 2014, and every 100 years, the protocol will be adjusted, will mass agreement of course, to scrub the coins that have been unused for 100 years. The entire Bitcoin network will be alerted and any user, with coins that are old, must move them within a very reasonable period of time. Then the "lost" coins will be resurrected every 100 years. But there will be never more than 21 million in existence.

Value of the loan will be readjusted during the life of the loan. The writer of the article clearly doesn't have a solid understanding of economics, Austrian economics or even basic economic principles. There is no proof throughout history that deflationary currencies hinder economic growth. For most of our history, gold was the store of value, and things went on just fine. When fractional lending began, that's when the economy started to tilt and income inequality blossomed to huge proportions. Currently, the financial industry is set up to benefit the rich to steal from the poor.

That is completely unconstitutional and won't happen. There is noting in the constitution that says we have to use $USD in this country. We can trade chickens for cars if we want to. The IRS, FBI, CIA, NSA can much more easily follow the Bitcoin blockchain as they can tap your phone, internet, etc. They will just know you have Bitcoin, and audit and tax you. There is absolutely no way ever they will be able to stop you from acquiring them by any law, ever.

Here's why. Because Bitcoins are very RARE and difficult to obtain. Just try and go buy a lot of them! It would take a while and the blockchain and press would erupt! If I had a million dollars, it would take months to personally acquire that much in BTC. That is, unless I invest in the Second Market scam or Winkelvi ETF when it comes out. Which is a no. So basically Google is behind and sh*t out of luck on the Bitcoin train so far.

BFL won't ship anything for a while and Cointerra hasn't even bumped out their chips yet. (Or produced one production model, only a prototype and I haven't seen that hashing). Even if they ship on time, KNC is 2400 units, let's over estimate at 4TH each. Rounded up to 40,000 TH, that's 40 petahash. So you're saying that Black arrow, BFL, and Cointerra each match that (won't happen), that's  160 petahash, add in other misc vendors, and estimate at  210 petahash for the year, that's  about  30 billion increase in difficulty in 2014. Am I leaving out anything? Because I way overestimated and came out at half your number.  So the only one of these vendors who has delivered anything of quality on time has been KNC.  My Neptune, when I get it, before most of the others, will have the best chance at a return. If not, it was a valiant effort.

The $ per GH/s to break even at each of those points could be calculated. (Based on avg. BTC price of time period). Right now, that cost is about $19.50 (.0251 BTC) per GH/s to break even on an ASIC. (Assuming no electricity costs).  
If a miner cost $4.67 (0.00601 BTC) per GH/s it has a chance to break even before the difficulty crosses the line around February.
All assuming 100% growth rate/month.

A few mistakes and bad assumptions in this article. Bitcoin is not anonymous and transfers are safe between individuals with little or no fraud. Bitcoin was known well before the Silk Road debacle. What the article completely misses out is showing a side by side comparison for all the services mentioned of fees and times it takes to complete a transfer. Bitcoin is far superior in this regard. Also, converting Bitcoin back to fiat on the receiving end can be difficult. A factor that we all hope won't be needed in the near future.

Everything he has said is true. There is almost no argument against it. Right now, the greatest utility of Bitcoin is for a slight (1%) reduction in credit card fees, that is when a retailer uses Bitpay and converts back to FIAT immediately. Also for immediate payments and long distance transfers. But in those cases, most people convert back to fiat as well. For Bitcoin to adopt, on a large scale, it must be traded directly, and for that to happen, it needs to be as close to popularity as debit cards.

With a paper wallet, the private key is encrypted (BIP0038) and the creation of the encrypted key was done completely offline (in my case). Sure, the key can be brute forced, but with a properly created keyphrase, the paper wallet is just as safe as an Armory offline wallet. I think I would call them equal. But my research isn't done yet. Will post my findings.

If a currency has a fixed supply such as Bitcoin, the value should increase, but, that is not always true. Lending of money for economic growth is essential so an index is needed to determine the interest rate. Lending would minimize risk of holding in the long term. For example, if I wanted to make 5% on my BTC over 10 years, and lent some out at that interest rate, and the value of BTC dropped, I would make money, if the value of my BTC increased by more than 5%, I could have taken the risk, or lent it out and had a guaranteed return. This will be essential to stabilizing Bitcoin for the long term.

Also, a history function would be very useful.

People get blinded by the prospect of mining for bitcoin. BFL is just the tip of the iceberg of scams and crimes. Cloud hashing and others just steal money and given no returns. KnC is the only trustworthy company and their new products may not even be worth it.

You mean a little "buying/spending," right? Buying and selling BTC for cash creates nothing. Just like the millions of stock brokers out there. Using your BTC for what it was intended creates much more growth in the BTC industry. That is what I meant.

Create a Bitcoin eBay style auction site. Combine the best parts of eBay and Craigslist. Have live side by side BTC/$USD so users can bid in either denomination, but only pay in BTC of course. It would be great to be able to sell my stuff for BTC. Would need an escrow function (cold wallet) so BTC can be held during shipping. Once recipient confirms delivery, funds are released.

I recently had the same problem. They didn't know what they were doing and then made ME call the wire dept. I'm like, isn't that your job? So I sat on hold, in their branch, got the wire person, they confirmed that my bank codes were right, then I put them on the phone with the branch manager to explain it. Took over an hour for something that could take a minute with BTC.

6c a day or .001 BTC a day. A waste of space and time. If you really want to get into mining do tons of research on bitcointalk.com. Go to KnC Miner and register for updates. Stock up some BTC and be ready to buy when KnC posts equipment for sale. It sells out very fast. They are the most reputable company out there. There is NO POINT in using regular computers to mine BTC. If you make a Litecoin rig (google it) out of graphics cards and mine scrypt alt-coins. That COULD produce something you could exchange for some BTC.

$1000 is irrelevant because any price BTC is irrelevant with so few places to spend BTC and even most of those vendors using Bitpay and instantly converting back to $USD. I am a huge supporter but the vendors out there for BTC Black Friday and as a whole are pretty slim. CNBC was laughing at us all, and so do my friends (who I told to buy at $120). With all the profit we've made, it's just money. Without widespread adoption, it's all pointless.

I have been mining LTC for a month and accrued 4 of them. Also upgraded my graphics card and now making 10-12 a month. I hope your theory is correct. And no, I'm not trading my BTC for anything except quality goods and services who deserve it.

Plenty of people are having cash out problems and Coinbase also charges larger transactions fees and has minimums for spending your BTC. Can't send a satoshi from Coinbase without a .005 fee. Kind of pointless. Need a home based secure and encrypted wallet with a small balance for buying stuff.

Mobile wallets are not just on your phone, they are cloud wallets such as Coinbase. So losing your phone won't lose anything.
I'm not sure about the Android apps.
In my opinion, Coinbase is very convenient for purchasing and spending Bitcoins, especially on my iPhone. But for larger positions use encryption keys and cold storage, you can't beat keeping your wallet backed up and encrypted. I expect that in the near future, there will be some Coinbase accounts frozen and confiscated by the govt. due to suspected tax evasion and illegal practices.

Just filed claims for a recent purchase in early Sept. (2013). With all current jalapeno's shipping from March, a unit delivered in 6 months will be a nice coffee warmer, but useless as a Bitcoin miner. So after 20 days, I asked BFL for a refund. They denied with a form letter. (BELOW). So I hope PayPal will help me get a refund.
While we reserve the right to handle refund requests on a case by case basis, pre-ordered products are non-refundable as is clearly stated at the time of purchase.  The reason for this is that pre-order funds are used in the build process which makes it impractical to reverse.  It's also been observed that some small number of customers have placed orders as part of a bitcoin price hedging strategy which involves multiple requests to cancel and then re-enstate their orders as market conditions change.  This has created an enormous customer service burden which is resolved by enforcing the all sales final policy.
Some customers have asked why we've given order cancellation refunds to others, but they can't get one.  The answer is that we had opted to process order cancellation requests during our long product development phase as a courtesy to those who endured the stress of the unknown.  However, once full production began, a notice was sent out advising that orders would be shipped as produced according to the order queue and that if anyone was unwilling to endure the wait, they had a final opportunity to cancel.  Customers were required to positively confirm their desire to remain in the order queue and accept the order terms.
Pre-Order terms for new orders were updated on the website on April 1, 2013.  The terms state, "I accept the terms of the sale and understand that all sales are final and there is a backlog of orders and production &amp; delivery of my order may take 2 months or longer."
As a Wyoming Corporation, we operate under the US Federal Trade Commission's business guide for mail or telephone ordered merchandise.  The relevant guideline suggests that if no delivery terms are stated or agreed to, then 30 days should be assumed.  In our case, we've gone to great length to ensure there is no ambiguity.  Customers are/were notified of the back order situation, the inability to cancel their order and the multi month wait to be expected. However, we have added a new feature to your account dashboard. You have the option of selling your order. There are more details and instructions on how to do so on our facebook page. 
Announcing a Pre-Order Marketplace
Butterfly Labs is excited to announce a platform that will help merge the needs of both parties. A seller will be able to announce the sale of their pre-order position in our classifieds forum. They will establish the terms of sale and make the deal on their own. Once a deal has been made, they will use the transfer system in their account Dashboard to transfer an order to a new owner. When both parties verify and agree to the terms, the order will be moved to the buyer's account.
The order transfer system was set in place September 10, 2013.Butterfly Labs will only provide the platform for the order transfer to take place. We are not responsible for any deals made between our customers. Use of the order transfer system is solely the risk of the parties making the order transfer deal. Buyer's must agree to the original terms of the sale, and specifically to the no refund policy.
Here is the relevant FTC guideline text:
"when you advertise merchandise, you must have a reasonable basis for stating or implying that you can ship within a certain time. If you make no shipment statement, you must have a reasonable basis for believing that you can ship within 30 days."
Kindest Regards,
Butterfly Labs

The real question is WHEN will you get your hands on the unit? Time is money. The problem with all of these calculators is they don't accurately reflect the increase in the mining difficulty. The Genesis Block way OVER estimates increases, while many others gravely underestimate the increases. I have calculated that the mining network will grow by a MAXIMUM of 7 Pentahashes per month in 2014. That would be an increase of 1 Billion a month in difficulty. That would be quite an increase. But if you get your hands on that miner soon, you could get some return.
