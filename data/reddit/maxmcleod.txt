It's not going to be a popular opinion but I think you should cut your losses and invest in something with a better short term return if you are a short term investor.  It feels like Bitcoin/crypto could be entering a bear market, so it could be a while until you realize gains or break-even. Meanwhile, the US Stock market is on fire and definitely not in a bear market. 
Then again, nobody knows, so you should make up your own mind and choose the option that you can live with.

I think gdax is broken or actively participating in the market manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:25:38
I have no problem with them trading BCH, they just handled the whole situation in a very shady way.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:46:17
Why wouldn't you do this though honestly?  This shouldn't even be possible in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:38:00
"Investigating" the insider trading... so rolling around in their huge piles of money and waiting for the whole thing to blow over?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:35
This is bad for the crypto markets, it definitely seems like Coinbase has lost any sense of being a neutral market. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:44:51
I agree that this is REALLY bad for the crypto community.  I think these exchanges and their greed could potentially be the downfall of the crypto market as a whole. 
We need to start to have the discussion of how to free ourselves from these corporate exchanges and control by big money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:58
This is clearly market manipulation.  Coinbase is profiting immensely from this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:32:32
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:38
Where's the reference they can't trade for 3 weeks?  
Clearly Coinbase was holding BCH before their announcement and now they are pumping it up to sell to all the FOMO buyers that are seeing a $8,500 price on a broken/frozen website.  I don't see how they could NOT be profiting.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:28:26
Are you using GDAX?  If so- you will want to select Limit Order rather than Stop Order if you want to get a specific price either buying/selling.  If you just want to dump coins if they reach/fall past a level than you should use a stop limit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:18:23
I know you are joking, but this still physically hurt me to read.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:47:50
*minutes after starting
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:40:00
Yes, this needs to be seen.  Coinbase is blatantly manipulating their own market to profit. 
They are making money off the panic of people buying and selling as well as the suckers that are buying coinbase's BCH at this frozen price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:43:20
Good luck!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:32:10
Wow, you are not joking...
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:19
We need a decentralized market, this is going to keep happening over and over. Greed will be our ruin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:37:23
Fair points but just to play devil's advocate, you have to admit that the blockchain, decentralized currency and crypto technology is more revolutionary than beanie babies.  Especially in the increasingly globalized and interconnected economy we are living in.

Welp, time to move to Italy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:00
they will be the first to be able to sell when it goes live
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:53:49
Transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:05:50
I am not biased, I don't own any BTC or BCH.  I am just a blockchain/crypto supporter.  It just seems to me like cultivating such animosity and splitting the community between BCH and BTC is not a healthy route to be taking and to be encouraged by our markets.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:13:49
Says the transaction occurred 3 months ago...
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:11:21
$2 billion is peanuts
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:37
Yes, this is such a clear pump and dump.  I think this will have lasting effects on coinbase and the crypto markets as a whole.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:05:15
I've bought and sold BTC since 2013 and I understand why BCH was forked.  I just don't understand why there is such animosity between the two groups.  It is having a negative effect on the whole crypto scene. Maybe just greed and jealousy? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:36:14
Good to hear.  But I would recommend doing some research on the pro's and con's of limit/stop orders (they operate basically the same way on GDAX as on the real stock market and brokerages) if you plan to use them to trade.  They can either save your ass or screw you over if you use them incorrectly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:48
The sell off is going to be INSANE and unprecedented unless they pull some serious bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:18:40
Stop orders place a market order to be filled and don't guarantee your price.  Limit orders on the other hand will guarantee your price but not that the order will actually be filled.  
Stop orders are dangerous if the price changes rapidly or drastically because the order will most likely be filled for a different price due to the higher levels of volume.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:21:12
Fair enough, good points.  Still seems like it could have been handled better.  Maybe just more transparency?  Prior to today, I was completely unaware that this was their plan.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:14
GDAX has a much higher limit for wire transfers (I think).
However, I would be more worried about the tax implication of this especially if it is a sum that will be limited by a $10k withdraw limit.  I would HIGHLY suggest talking to an accountant before selling the coins or withdrawing cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:47:35
They are a company looking to IPO... why are they the de facto exchange of our decentralized currency again?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:57:49
The IRS and other country's tax enforcement agencies are going to need to adapt to the new paradigm and accept that cryptocurrency is a legitimate thing.  
Hopefully someday they will create clear rules and systems for taxing cryptocurrency.  It's honestly in their best interest as well as the best interest of the platform.  
Governments are going to start realizing the amount of taxes that are being evaded and will have no choice but to either clamp down or create a space for their growth.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:21:52
So you are ok with a single exchange having the power to create such fear in a market that it drops 15% in a matter of hours?  Just by "adding" a new feature.  
I have no problem with BCH being traded on CB, but the manner that they implemented it was very careless and shady especially since they hold millions of dollars in other peoples money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:15:53
There was a fork in the BTC blockchain on Aug 1st and everyone whom held BTC at that time received the equal amount of BCH (Bitcoin Cash).  Coinbase decided today was the day to finally let a large portion of their customers know that they exist and have been sitting there for 3 months.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:18
Yes, it is free crypto.  BCH was a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain and everyone who held any Bitcoin received the same amount in BCH when the fork occurred.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:29:32
I mean the subsequent crash and burn that occurred with the dotcom boom.  Clearly we are nearing the heights of the bubble, but haven't experienced the downturn yet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:51:47
This is the biggest problem I have.  Why didn't they announce the BCH addition ahead of time rather than springing it on everyone and completely fucking the whole crypto market.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:49
About coinbase adding BCH to their market
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:53:01
Yea, exactly.  A real crash would be &lt;$500 bitcoins, this is just the market finding a new floor and ceiling.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:43
They are definitely overwhelmed with traffic, but it seems like they should have maybe expected it and planned for it considering they are holding millions and millions of dollars in other peoples money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:09
Coinbase getting rich
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:34:24
It's hard to say, however signs seem to be pointing towards a sell off.  Especially since thousands (maybe millions?) of coinbase users just discovered they have BCH and will most likely try to sell it at any price because it's "free money"
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:25
Ok, you are right about the BCH. But, still, I think it's important that we don't let Coinbase and other exchanges interfere with the market to such a degree. Crypto is supposed to be unregulated and decentralized, not under the thumb of a single company to such a degree.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:33
They didn't expect this much traffic and trading?  Are they living on planet Earth?  They should have planned for this better.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:11
Is this real?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:35:46
LOL that was a great read.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:00:52
Good point
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:02
This is definitely crypto history in the making.  It seems like BCH and BTC are having their first head-to-head battle.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:55
This is going to be very interesting when they open trading
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:03
Only people allowed to sell are those that work at Coinbase and their friends.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:08
Truth, there's no questioning that Bitcoin has evolved beyond what Satoshi imagined and has become it's own creature molded by human greed and near nearsightedness. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:18:15
The stock market crash of 1929 was a 89% decrease in stock value... So it can happen
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:12
Just my opinion, I don't mean to spread any misinformation. I just think this is a sign of things to come.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:38:04
The only thing that can help us fight collusion/manipulation is information.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:16:09
This is the most central argument over BTC and BCH.  People that support BTC mostly see it has an investment tool and a store of wealth while BCH supporters see it as a day-to-day purchasing tool (at least in the short term).  Of course this is an oversimplification but it is the general source of the split of communities. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:03
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:11
They should have just let their users withdraw BCH rather than hiding it and then springing the BCH exchange on them. Why was it not an option to withdraw your BCH before they released the exchange?  clearly they were hoping to capitalize on it
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:07:22
I figured they would at least give a warning closer than 4 months away.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:25
It's only $8,500 because coinbase halted trading at that price
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:51:49
Well it exists somewhere, but tracking it down might be difficult if you don't know the specifics of where is was held when the fork occurred.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:39
We need a decentralized exchange.  I'm not sure if it is possible or how to do it. But we need to have this discussion before things get out of control.  
Coinbase is going to start peddling more and more altcoins to be pumped and soon it will be the dotcom boom 2.0 
EDIT: Ok, apparently there are a lot of options. thank you for all the suggestions!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:05:01
I wish I knew.  It's truly a unique paradigm, Bitcoin was created to eliminate the middleman in contracts and transactions, but consequently created a new even more powerful middle man now required to actually purchase the currency.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:06:50
The fork happened almost 5 months ago.... They should have allowed their users to withdraw BCH at that time.  But they wanted to wait until they could launch their own exchange and reveal to their users these coins which magically appeared from "nowhere", which they could then conveniently sell on the coinbase market and give a % back to ol mr. coinbase himself.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:34
Almost 12k in BCH sell orders wowow
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:13:52
Honestly opened it up expecting shit, but actually pretty good!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:00
I am the same way. I have been effected very little in a monetary way from the events of today, but I am a true believer in the crypto and blockchain technology and I am extremely troubled by the events today. 
Crypto is supposed to be decentralized and not at the whims of the powers-that-be, but today has demonstrated the power that a single company has in swaying and controlling the entire market.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:18
Sounds like he definitely did his research before investing
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:19:52
I don't know about insider trading or criminal acts, but they should have handled the BCH situation better by allowing their customers to withdraw way before randomly implementing an exchange and revealing their existence at the same time.  
It just seems to me like Coinbase wanted to capitalize on the huge amount of BCH it was sitting on and they figured if they opened the exchange they could get trading fees for people selling/buying the newly discovered BCH as well as stimulate the price and increase the value of their personal holding.
But-  the market only managed to stay open for about 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:58
True, but I guess my gripe is more about the implementation and execution rather than the fact of actually adding BCH to the exchange.  
It just seems to me like Coinbase was going for maximum market impact by choosing the most divisive coin to add over countless other choices, releasing it without any warning or indication and then subsequently failing miserably at actually keeping the market open.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:48:38
Yes, the people with BCH coins that just appeared out of nowhere will be willing to sell at a much lower price because it was money they didn't even know they had yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:44
Some people are going to get completely burned when they restart trading...  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:27:15
My only real complaint about the whole situation is that they just sprung the addition on everyone without warning and then didn't have the resources or planning to actually operate the exchange.
Why didn't they announce?  Why did they immediately crash and take the market down?  What did they expect, of course there was going to be crazy volume.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:43:37
Yeah, many months ago.  Then, no updates until it was randomly dropped out of the blue.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:58
The fork occurred on Aug 1st, so if you held BTC at that point, there is an equal amount of BCH that exists somewhere.  If your BTC was in your breadwallet at that time, then they would presumably have control of the BCH.
