Come from the land of the ice and snow where the hodlers hodl and the bitcoin flows.

From what I can tell from messing with it a bit, I've had to click "add all" like I'm about to sell out, then it will give me it's value in USD.

That will be up to someone else to answer. I'd love to know as well. Though I'd say that if your goals are for short term gain, keep your trading amount on the market and a safety amount in the ledger. If hodling then hodl and tuck that shit away.

Hoping for the same thing.

It briefly broke the wall this morning. I'm waiting for it to go back through. Still going to hodl until it's $500+.

Newbie myself here, and from the research I've done and the general consensus around here is NO. Get yourself a wallet, something I'm working on doing myself. If you don't own the keys to the account, you don't own the bitcoin. If coinbase gets hacked/shut down/compromised, your investment is gone. If you transfer those coins onto a hard wallet or holding software then your coins are much safer in your own hands. 
That being said, I am just getting the hang of this too. So do your own research and do some more digging to find what is right for you and your goals.

It's value, just like any other currency, good, or service, is based on how much it's perceived yo be worth. This is determined by how many people are using it and how much they're still willing to pay to gain one, or even a percent of one more. Bitcoin will crash if everyone sells their share and abandons the service. Bitcoin will continue to rise as more people buy it at its market price, utilize it as a currency, spread knowledge, and encourage more people to use it.
For example, the newest IPhone wouldn't be worth your pocket change if the public dropped it's status and perceived it as a piece of crap and waste of money. Conversely, it's price will continue to rise with each new model since they're seen as the hottest new phone with the best features.

I admit defeat. My witty lyricism did not match your logic laden tunes.

You can get a good look at a t-bone by sticking your head up a butcher's ass, but wouldn't you just take his word for it? No wait.. it's gotta be your bull.
