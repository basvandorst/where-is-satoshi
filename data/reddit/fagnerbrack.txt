I strongly disagree with the article, Bitcoin has its place on scarce store of value that has a historical relevance as much as Mona Lisa has.
Just posting here to have some counter arguments.

I've [written a TL;DR]( from what I understand about it.

Not download to their computers, just ran on the webpage.

You can see some discussion [in the previous links]( but they mostly talk about the old text. ATO has changed it on March 2018.
DISCLAIMER: I'm not an accountant and this is not tax advice.
So I've talked with some of the best accountants in Australia in regards to the **old rules** NOT THE NEW ONES LINKED HERE and here's what they told me:
* If you use Bitcoin without being a business and the transaction is less than 10k, then you don't need to pay CGT.
* If you have a business or the transaction is above 10k, you need to pay CGT.
Now **things have changed**.
---&gt; TL;DR:
It seems that the intention of why you use Bitcoin is what counts. Nevertheless, you're required to keep track of all transactions you do.
In reality, nobody knows shit, even inside the ATO. Unless you're transacting a huge amount of money, you should be fine. However, they'll probably judge your intention. If there's evidence your intention is to use it as an investment, then you'll pay CGT.
I'm not sure how it would look like on the wild. Has anybody here that lives in Australia been charged by the ATO for somehow (probably unknowingly) not paying Tax correctly? If so, how was the experience?

TL;DR is:


LPPLS-like trajectories, which were followed by crashes or strong corrections. Although the height
and length of the bubbles vary substantially, we showed that, when scaled to the same log-height and
length, a near-universal super-exponential growth is documented. This is in radical contrast to the
view that crypto-markets follow a random walk and are essentially unpredictable.
