Omg Its Very simple to Cashout
couple of options
Since Coinbase let you withdraw btc to btc then you can do following
Paypal (Send ur BTC to Localbitcoin wallet and then sell it for Paypal)
Send it to One of you friends if they need since its v low and ask them to send u cash ..
Sell On LBC by other Means Chase quickpay / cash deposit / many more
you can also use paxful

Holding For Sure
Only Noobs in this game will panic the big braveheart will catch them like baby fishes 
We Saw btc drop from 1200 to $100 : )

Holding 200 Coin Since 2014 bought at $1200 : )
Today Bought another 100 Coins at 13K : )
Never Panic
Never Listen to those GoV and Bankers who scared of this coin
Never Listen to others .. 
This coin I saw many ups and down
Now its 100% sure that it will go 100K each coin soon
Every Panic situation is an opportunity to get coins from week hands : )
Yes Yes Gov and Bank are manipulating this coin alot by investing heavily but inside they are feared 
this is all scripted
Bitcoin is made to live it cant die 
Read it code carefully : )

Just Keep one thing in your mind and you will never panic
"Bitcoin is Made to Live ,, By Reading it Code ,,No One Controls it Its Totally Decentralized " 
:) 
Just Watch its Graph By zooming in from 2010 to 2013 : )

Core had made a lot of adjustment to new Qt software
I must say Fist of all keep multiple secured backup of your wallet even before running new core
Just let it run it pretty much normal
Headers yes they will be synchronized fast
but it take some time since you said 2013 
so depend on ur network speed and HDD speed it might can take 8 - 20 hours
Just do a fresh install of Qt software
Back up ur old wallet somewhere safe and let QT run untill it catchup all blocks
then once you see it finished delete the new wallet.dat and put the old one
Simple !!
