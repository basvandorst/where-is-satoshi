Oh look, I just found 200.000 BTC under my couch! Just spare change, but hey, these are rough times - Mark Karpeles logic
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:53:04
This guy is pure gold. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:21:49
Mark Karpeles will soon join Marvel as a new villain. Kids will love him
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:37:17
Thank you sir!
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:31:46
Thank you. So each unit is now 14 units? And now they won't reinvest part of the dividends in more hashing power anymore?

Disabling extensions is probably the safest thing to do, but what about Adblock Plus? Isn't that safe to use? It would be a pain to browse without it.

Purse.io or Brawker will do the trick for you. However, the BTC/USD prices are overly inflated there, so expect to get much less from a normal exchange on those sites.

Are they aware of this? I thought no CC processor wanted anything to do with Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-28 06:55:05
Hey another China BTC ban! Can you spot the other 42 upcoming next week?
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:38:50
If you want CEX.io losing miners, then you need to offer a better cloud hashing / market alternative. They have no competition as of now

I'm sorry, but you'll see that professor Bitcorn is right and the price will plummet to 10$ in June. You can't beat professor Bitcorn. You simply can't.

Glenn Beck is a total moron that sees anything out of his agenda as communism. Bitcoin is probably a communist-Obama-invented currency to him.

We need more ASICs than the USSR has
@_date: 2014-05-26 07:38:41
You mean he actually meant 0.1 $? That seems more likely! All hail professor Bitcorn!
@_date: 2014-05-06 05:27:58
So, any bets on when the next China ban will come? I mean, BTCChina can still try to take bottlecaps, baseball cards, monopoly money for BTC. It will take another 5000 China bans to ban all the things they can trade for BTC.

Can this site be trusted with your Credit Card? I have been waiting ages to be able to buy BTC with my International Debit Card
@_date: 2014-04-19 22:13:36
Remember kids, don't give your Bitcoins to shady Sportsbooks

Thanks for the guide, but that guy seems to be quite paranoid about security. Should I be too? If anyone can suggest another guide with other programs, those are welcome too!
@_date: 2014-04-22 05:50:31
They should rename themselves to "Moth Labs"
@_date: 2014-07-05 02:49:40
I think you mean "Hodling"?

Costa Rica here. Nobody knows what Bitcoin is, and the few ones that do, think the usual "fake money with no backing, yadda yadda". My country should be marketed as a potential Bitcoin center for Latin America. We already have a great amount of big company call centers, Poker sites are hosted here and it's full of expats.
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:31:17
This is just a BTC poker forum, or am I missing something? Where does the site state that they will award free BTC or freeroll codes?
Edit: I see it's like completing surveys and offers. I pass
@_date: 2014-04-24 03:48:28
Boy, we've got one of them bitter basement dwellers here. You must be a blast in parties.
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:15:08
NATO of course
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:03:21
I lol'd at the Karpeles reference

Fixed the title for you

Incoming China ban # 1486!
@_date: 2016-03-23 19:28:05
[WeSellCrypto]( prepare to pay around $50 more per BTC though

Featuring Professor Bitcorn as himself.

This. And a good and trustworthy one. I've seen a few browser-based ones with 1998 graphics and horrible website designs, which just deter anyone from wanting to give it a try.
