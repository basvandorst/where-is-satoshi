You seem to only know Kurzweilian Thinking 101.
Then, there is physics. In 100 years, we made very limited progress in batteries, because you have fundamental limitations. Lithium batteries are made of lithium became it is number 3 on the periodic table and H and He are gas at room temparature.
Carbon magic is used to reduce energy loss. This is wonderful to make transistors/cables/capacitors, but this won't allow denser storage than lithium.
There are things that can be made massively better, not others.
In energy storage, evolution found nothing better than sugar, which is chemical bond storage, like oil, it creates wastes and is painful to manage. Electron storage in batteries is much weaker but reversible. And electron storage in capacitors is even weaker but very fast and it doesn't get damaged when reversed millions of times.
We will reduce the price of batteries and solar pannels by scaling factories, not by making exponential technological progress.
So don't be fooled by basic exponential thinking. Exponentials only work for things that can be made smaller. Until you reach physical ceilings.
@_date: 2016-08-29 09:33:54
Yes, yes. But it must still go on. And like many energy technologies, the last step is the hardest, because we discover all the scaling issues.
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:37:27


The thing is, we don't sell camp fires, with sell holiday services that includes a campfire. Also, the energy of a campfire is so cheap that it is a tiny part of the price of the service that includes the campfire. Running a server rack for 1h is nearly free. What is expensive is running 10000 server racks 24/7. And most of the value of the server rack comes from manufacturing the server, the datacenter and all the software around it.


As global GDP and energy are 99% correlated, it means that efficiency decreases GDP, frees energy and recreates GDP. Technological progress doesn't create growth in itself, it creates growth by allowing easier extraction of energy.
The value of 1€ of GDP increases over time, as absolute amounts of stuff you can buy with it, GDP measures scarcity, not absolute value.
As we are constrained in our ability to produce more energy in the last 50 years (since the 70s oil crises), capitalists increases the supply of human labour to decrease its value (globalisation), while also creating unemployment.
We really need to find new ways to extract more energy, or we will see more and more inequality. More inequality is simply what happens when you have technological progress without an increase in energy supply.

You sound like someone who listens too much to Kurzweil.

@_date: 2016-08-29 15:09:36
Yes. My post speaks about scaling issues.
When you are insignificant, you can produce and nobody cares. When you are the biggest producer, you shape the market.
Have you heard of solar market price being negative during peak production in summer ? This is the kind of scaling issue I am talking about.
Most of the technological investment went toward solar production price, not intermitency management.
@_date: 2016-08-30 11:15:52
The faith is deep in you. I wonder if you work in science/non-software engineering. Only non technical people and people in IT can be blind to physical limits.
There is not always exponentials. In many domains, there has been close to no progress for 50 years, because there are strong laws of physics and the best possible stuff was done long ago.
If we want to do grid scale eoectricity storage, graphene magic is useless. Either we use lithium becaude there is a large industry or we use iron because it is the cheapest metal. Or we hydrogen, it is simple and scalable, but we lose 80-90% of the energy in the process so solar electricity would need to be really really cheap to make hydrogen storage viable.
Yes, there will be more progress in making PV cheaper, but how much is not obvious. And the magic belief that exponentials go forever is stupid. The same kind of stupidity of those who denied the end of the exponential production of oil in the 60s.
@_date: 2016-08-29 09:04:12
Well. That's nice but no.
Global GDP is 99% correlated with energy consumption. Energy is all that matters.
The parts of the economy that are deflationary are benefitting from miniaturisation, smaller things use less matter and energy. But as long as we keep using the energy for something else it's fine.
Moore's law doesn't make the world deflationary because we consumme more of it. It's more like Intel having a fixed share of the global energy and using it as best as they can.
And solar energy is still far from being profitable at scale, there is still no solution to the intermittency issue. We will need solar to be at least 2-5x cheaper than conventional energy to be viable at scale due to the cost of intermittency.
@_date: 2016-08-29 14:53:57
Why ? Currently, solar produces between 10h and 16h. Peaks of consumption are between 6-8h and 19h-22h. And many industries want 24/7 consumption to use their facilities at max capacity, running at night too (currently, this is a good thing for baseload electricity).
Electricity storage is currently extremely expensive.
To be scalable, solar+storage must be cheaper than conventional. What is in the news is that in sunny areas, €/kWh averaged over the lifetime of the panel is getting competitive. But €/kWh isn't based on market prices, a kWh of intermittent electricity is less valuable than a kWh of on demand electricity.
So 1€ of gas electricity will need to be replaced by 0.2€ of solar electricity + 0.8€ to store the electricity.
And I'm being nice by saying that storage is just 80% of the total cost. Currently, large scale storage doesn't exist with batteries. The only large scale storage is molten salt concentration solar. Pumped hydro is limited by the amont of hydro you have.

You are wrong about SA dropping USD and going to China.
The SA monarchy is weak and corrupt. The SA bourgeoisie is strong and wealthy. Class warfare is fueling conflicts in all the MiddlecEast. The US protects the monarchy from internal threats so the business class knows they have to shut up. Instead, the business class floods the muslim revolutionaries of neighbour countries with oil money (Al Quaida with its founder being all sons of SA billionaire entrepreneurs, Muslim Brotherhood jumping from nowhere in Tunisia and Egypt after the revolitions, ISIS on the borders of SA today).
If SA betray the US, the US will back the business class who is much more skilled at governing. In a few months the Saud family would fall and be expropriated by the business class.
The US likes the monarchy better because the business class would be more greedy and harder to control because they are more skilled. So the US would get a smaller share of oil profits. The status quo is better for both the US and the Saud family.

Vote in third parties exists in Europe and is still quite efficient. The Pirate Party can be much stronger after the april EU election if young people vote for them. Not so much in the US it seems.
Demonstrating is very efficient. I am French and I can confirm. This is not the US culture today because this had been crushed. A century ago, unionists fought in the US, some died, but they succeded. Again for the civil rights movements (white racists politicians giving real rights to slavish blacks, not bad). The only thing the powerful fear is a mob of angry citizens coming for them and blocking the economy, the good thing is that poor people are those who run the economy by doing all the boring stuff that enable the everyday life of a company, when they stop working even a giant corporation is doomed. You are seeing an incredible come back of unions in Wallmart and Mac Donalds, something is coming, many people are getting really pissed in the US.
And by participating in political reform I mean technology to enable new ways of organizing democracy, like online direct democracy or ways to mobilize the crowd online. We barely scratched the surface of what we can do with the internet.

It is not a scam to change the unit to have something easy to manipulate. It is why the metric system is great.
If people are too stupid to understand metric unit tranformations, it is stupidity not scam. And using big numbers is quite easy, decimal numbers are less instinctive for me. 0.0003 and 0.003 require me to think, 3000 and 30000 are easier.
So it is better have mBTC when most people use $0.50 to $50 transactions most of the time.

You are exactly like Ron Paul and his followers, you refuse to admit that real libertarianism cannot exist, the same way real socialism cannot exist.

In real libertarianism you get what we have today, a weak government bought by a handfull of wealthy people. Free market cannot exist and perfect wealth distribution cannot exist because people are assholes and will try to cheat to get more power.
Both are equal crap. But today when you tell to the average Ron Paul fan that libertarianism is crap, you are labbelled marxist ... Nope. All is in the balance of powers. You always have to fight to get a system that equally respect the average people and allow actions. And currently the handful of super rich are too powerful and it is getting even worse.

For the MtGox story, we need one simple thing : security audits. To do this we need security norms and independant audit organisations. This is only possible of there is enough income for the exchanges to pay for designing the norms and paying the audits.
We also need insurrance, but this requires audits and an idea of the probability of massive thefts for the insurrance brokers.
The banking industry had centuries to develop and adapt security standards, and countless heists. Until Bitcoin exchanges do the same, we will see people being Goxed again.
Gox is a message sent to other exchanges : they have to work together harder to set security standards and auditors.

Plenty of people put an order at 1200$ because it's a simple number and just wait passively.
Traders trade in real time against each others. And once in a while, they encounter a "large wall".
In the normal situation, there is a gap between the top buyer and the bottom seller. But when you have a wall of sellers and people want to push the price upward, they have to buy all the wall.
So it's just showing the traders estimating that the price is above 1200$ and absorbing the wall. The buying price is stuck at 1199.95 while the wall is being absorbed. Once the wall is absorbed, a gap between the buying and selling price appears at the end of the video.

Why is bitcoin a threat to globalisation ? It a truly global currency, it is globalist by design.
It removes the rent of central bank dividends, that's all. Most rent seeking today is through stock markets, debt is just one of many ways to extract value from people.
So bitcoin is a threat to existing banks, it is a threat to the business as usual, but it isn't a threat to the system. Bitcoin makes the system more efficient, reducing the need for middle class cogs to manage the wealth extraction machine.

Like all the commenters here, you know nothing at all of this story and just want to say "muuuh conspiracy".
Tapie is an old finished man, he has no power at all anymore. She could have let him rot and die. Fighting to get his money back after 30 years of trial was his last battle before his end. Lagarde gave it to him to close the case.
It had nothing to do with the IMF. This was a never ending case. Lagarde put an end to it. And now, it will go on again and again for more years.
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:18:29
You don't know the story, you just judge from a short news article.
This is a very long story. A major French bank (Credit Lyonnais) screwed many customers in the 80s with shady deals. It went bankrupt as a result. To avoid a massive collapse, the bank was nationalized and the government said that the government would handle paying for the crimes of the bank.
Tapie is among the list of the customers who got screwed.
After 30 years, the French economics minister gave the greenlight to pay Tapie. There is no debate about the fact that the state has to pay, the debate is about the amount, so say that instead of 300M€ it should have been 200M€ and Lagarde should have negotiated harder.
So in the end, it's a very complex and political trial. It's not simple "corrupt politician doing shit".
This is only a debate because 30 years passed since the bank went bankrupt in a cataclysmic fashion. Tapie and Lagarde are just finishing what the politicians of the 80s did.
It became political for this customer only (the others who got screwed by the bank got paid by the state long ago) because Tapie was famous in France: business man, politician, TV host, movie actor, singer, manager of the 2nd largest football team in France.

This is business law, it's about the state giving the amount the bank would have paid in a similar case.
And the arbitrage went back and forth between 200M€ and 300M€. Tapie refused the 200M€ settlement. Lagarde said it was ok for 300M€.
@_date: 2016-12-20 01:36:02
The arbitration was going back and forth for 15 years. Tapie was greedy to refuse the lower arbitrage.
Why did Lagarde choose to surrender instead of going for one more round of arbitrage to try to get back to 200M€, this is the debate. And I have no answer. But most of the media coverage is scandal based hysteria about the government giving a lot of money to a businessman. If Tapie had accepted the previous 200M€ arbitrage, the media would have had nothing to say but they would have cried world anyway.

France is very very far from seing shit happening.
You only hear about France because the aristocrats are fighting hard to kill unions and they resist. "We cannot afford to pay middle class welfare" works better if you are told "We are bankrupt" "We are living above our means". The funny things is that socialist Presidents do more to kill unions in one term than right wingers in two or three terms. In 3 years, President Hollande did more against unions than all that happened since the previous "socialist" President of the 80s who began massive privitization.
France is also one of the country with the highest level of savings in the world. We have shitloads of middle class money in our banks.
Also, unemployment is high as a public policy. The minimum wage, if you include business parts of the wage, are 2x higher than in the US, so given the GDP per capita in France, minimum wage is 3x higher than in the US. If you include the great pensions and healthcare, poors in France live more like 4x better than poors in the US. We prefer to have unemployed people than working poors. This is a policy choice, not a sign of economic failure.
Poors and middle class are being crushed currently, but this is just class warfare, not collapse.
If shit happens in France, it will be pogroms against muslims, not bankruptcy.

It could be done with a lotterie.
You lock some coins in a specific address for 1 month and you get X new coins and the right to submit a transaction block. The winner is chosen with the randomness of the transactions made within the month with the money locked.
The investors would have an incentive to keep the blockchain and broadcast the transactions as they need to be ready to broadcast the new block if they are the winner. The transaction fees incentivise winners to have lots of waiting transactions to add in a new block.
The total amount of locked coins would depend of the financial return on investment.

There are hundreds of types of socialism. The word socialism was invented in the XVIIIth century as an answer to radical individualism. Socialism just says that pure individualism leads to hell so we must have some degree of collective organisation.
Some level of socialism is absolutely mandatory, this is mathematically proven. Perfect individuals with perfect rationality and perfect information cannot deal with the problem of the Trajedy of the Commons without socialism.
All Tragedy of the Commons problems are naturally solved in human societies with various types of socialist systems (aka something that forces individuals to follow some collectively decided rules wether they like it or not). Religious faith, shared culture and so on. The modern state is nothing more than the same concept scaled up and improved to evolve and adapt much faster than traditional human methods.
In practice, pure capitalism cannot exist. As the state becomes weaker and weaker, feodalism appears to bring back some state power.
The places in the world that look the most like pure capitalist systems are large cities in developing countries with an incapable bureaucracy and private corporations doing everything without the need to care about the law. The result is land of private police and gated communities for the rich. No water pipes, you use water trucks to put waters in rich communities. No garbage management outside of gated communities. The list can go on and on.
Tragedy of the Commons scenarios are especially numerous in advanced societies with sophisticated financial systems. Pollution is local, shareholders are faceless. If you just obey the interests of the shareholders, there is no way you can prevent a local factory to pollute a river like crazy and fuck everyone living near the river. Pure capitalism has no mechanism to handle such issues. In primitive societies, there is a high priest telling you "if you pollute the river you go to hell and suffer for eternity, let's build a temple to worship the river and give money to the priests so we can tell you what Gods want you to do", in the modern state, you have a law telling you "don't pollute or you get a fine". Both the high priests and the technocrats are solutions to the Tragedy of the Commons problem. Technocrats are just much more efficient.
"The solution to pollution is dillution", that's why the US is so libertarian, they had an infinitely large land. So they had a tendancy to say "if you are fucked by a tragedy of the commons problem, just move elsewhere where there is less production and pollution". But in the 1960s, the US population and production became too large and it wasn't possible anymore to do it the old way. So the US started to do just like all places in the world in history : when you reach saturation, you put laws (mortal or divine) to force people to handle their pollution.

By accepting the value of the dollar, we accept the injustice of the system. And you accept that your wealth can be expropriated if the bank or the state decides it.
And don't dream, Bitcoin will never get widespread adoption, no more than usergroups got widespread adoption. People hate freedom and love the confortable chains designed by the society.
People don't want decentralised usergroups, they want centralised Facebook. When Facebook censors, most users are satisfied, to have a cleaner experience.
Bitcoin is excitting because it is cutting edge technology, it is the world of tomorrow. This is the privilege of being in the avant-garde.

Greece wasn't bailed out.
Greek State &gt; German Bank
Greek State &gt; IMF &gt; German State &gt; German Bank
What happened with Greece is loan refinancing. The German state gets a loan from German banks, the money is deposited to the IMF, the IMF loans the money to the Greek state, the Greek state gives the money to the German banks. Now, the Greek state has a debt to repay to the IMF instead of the German banks. And the IMF can tell you where to cut budgets to make sure you find money to keep paying your loans to the IMF. In exchange of this, you get lower market rates because it is impossible to default from the IMF (otherwise the CIA will stage a coup to put in power someone who will keep paying).
German banks now get their Greek money with the IMF and the German state as intermediaries.

I was just saying that free energy will never exist, just like we have CPUs a million times faster than 30 years ago, but computation is still not free. We just consumme much more of it. If we produced much cheaper energy, we would consumme much more of it, so it wouldn't be "dirt cheap" in large quantities.

I know this. But I usually seed more than 1. Also, most of the time small torrents only have seeders, so it has no impact. And I always download a few percents in random order while I set up my room in movie mode, to get a few pieces at random locations.
This is a real issue for series, as every sane person downlaod the episodes in order and many will stop before they reach the end. But for movies it is not that much an issue.
What disturbs me more is that with Popcorn Time, people will seed much less the little known movies as the memory is cleaned when we close the application.
But as bandwidth and storage size increases faster than movie size, seeding will be much less of an issue over time. Alone, I upload faster than the bitrate of most movies, this wasn't the case 10 years ago.

From 1965 to 2014, there is a 0.985 correlation between global GDP and global energy consumption.
When you look country by country it doesn't work because low GDP high energy industries went to China, but the added value remains here. So you need to look at the global level.
Also, it is not y=ax but y=ax+b, there is a constant. Often, you find graphs that says that energy intensity (y=ax) of GDP is going down, but it is false. It is just that there is constant, so as x goes up, the b becomes less important.
Energy efficiency destroys GDP, the energy will then be used elsewhere to recreate more GDP. Just look at Moore's Law. You CPU is a million time more energy efficient, but the GDP per Intel processor is more or less the same. We consumme a million times more computation that creates a million times less GDP.
GDP is just a proxy measurement for energy consumption, but going to a different pocket. Most energy consumption is done in China, in high energy processes on commoditized products (like raw material purification) with low added value.
So yes, in principle, consumming less energy would mean recession. Energy efficiency means reducing the GDP.
(This is about all energy, not just oil.)
@_date: 2015-10-14 09:41:46
The Golden Age existed because we started using Middle East oil and they could increase production 5% a year. And when growth is so massive, even reckless capitalists are forced to give money to the people.
GDP is correlated with global energy consumption with a 0.99 score, nearly perfect. We cannot grow fossil fuel production easily, most new investments try to replace the end of easy to drill empty sites with as much harder to drill rigs. And non fossil energy doesn't scale well.
So we are being squized. This has little to do with our level of income. This just has to do with the rate of growth. Democracy and capitalism are not functionnal without growth.

This is a way for Tesla to recycle its old half efficient batteries into something that is less sensitive to mass and volume scarcity. And it uses good PR to sell a consummer product to hippy Californians. This is far far far from enough to do it at global utility scale.
Also, the price of lithium will go up and up as the good mines are mined out and we have to move to less concentrated mines. Just like the price of copper is going up and up despite the technological progress and massive scale of mining. In 1900 mines were 10% copper, now they are 0.2% copper ...
We would need a 10x price reduction to make batteries cheap enough for grid storage. Tesla is cutting prices with scale. But soon, the price of batteries will not be limited by manufacturing but by lithium.
Also, I forgot to say before that photovoltaic cells are only one of the price factors. Today, solar units are starting to be cheap enough. We have to cut installation and maintenance costs now. Rooftop solar will disappear and we will move to countryside solar, to have robots doing installation and maintenance.
Solar works best in desertic areas ... But sand damages the protection glass of the pannels, reducing lifespan. Also, water is currently used to clean the pannels and massive solar farms consumme lots of water in already dry areas.
Photovoltaic + lithium batteries are not yet viable for massive scalability.

New powerstructures are very efficient at the early age but they evolve in classic power strugles. Tech entrepreneurs will not solve the issue of human greed. They also have the skills to understand massive surveillance systems as they became rich by selling your data, so they will be much more prone to develop efficient police states to protect their interests.

This will be user friendly. Some will say it kills the goal of Bitcoin, nope. As long as bank wallet security is optional.

I have mixed feelings with those ideas. Tech people doing fancy cryptosystems is great but to update democracy the issue is not technical, it is social.
Bitcoin works because you can start with a small community and develop more user frendly systems over time.
But to change elections you need to be elected first to force change. Making perfectly secured system would be ridiculously cheap with government funds allocated to physical elections.
If we do that stuff in the dark, we will need 5 years to get the technology and 5 years to get user friendly applications and 5 years to convince the population to use the tools of the hackers. I we convince people that they want that kind of system, it can be done in 1 year.
