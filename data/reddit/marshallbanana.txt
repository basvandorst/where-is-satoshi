Neither do most of the rest, either. The only vague correlation is that both lines trend up, and the scale has been forced to make them overlap.
There are a few short periods where they actually seem to correlate, but for most of the timeline they don't actually.

By hijacking all block rewards, they are already able to just about double their profits. They can afford a crash to half the price and still come out on top. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:02:32
800% increase and 75% decrease ends up meaning about twice the bandwidth. That is not really that much.
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:16:41
But not really, though. Bitcoin is still anonymous, and you can't really target anyone in particular with transaction blocks, unless they are being very sloppy.
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:28:31


Of course there's no guarantee. But that is what the leak suggests the number is.


He may have destroyed them between now and 2013, sure. But does that seem likely?
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:02:32
Does anyone have any proof whatsoever that it exists?
@_date: 2015-12-06 15:53:19


All of this would still be true even with a mining monopoly. The transactions would still be peer to peer. Only confirmation would be centralised, and it would in no way hinder anonymity.
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:32:45
I'm not sure it was a big source of uncertainty. People were people pointedly pretending it didn't exist, mostly.
@_date: 2015-12-06 15:50:21


This claim keeps being made, but there's no reason it needs to actually be true. Bitcoin will still remain useful for many people in this situation. People buying illegal goods on darknet markets, for instance.
@_date: 2015-12-06 14:47:34
Are you *entirely* sure the rest of the market agrees with you that that is the most valuable property?
Rather than, say, being a way to pay for illegal goods?
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:38:04


If so, why release an obvious piece of junk now?
@_date: 2015-12-06 16:34:44


But that is not true. Centralised *mining* in no way changes the anonymity properties of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-06 15:03:00


That is not a viable argument, and you should know better.
The real questions you need to answer are: How many pools are public? And out of those, how big a percentage of their hashing power come from other sources than their own mining farms?
@_date: 2015-12-09 09:00:44
Possibly, but by who?
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:36:05


Which is exactly what WIRED claims there is.
@_date: 2015-12-06 15:49:17


You keep claiming this, but you don't really have anything to back you up on this.
As a counter-example, both centralised and decentralised Bitcoin can be used to buy drugs on darknet markets. Those users would still find it valuable.
Especially if Bitcoin had a much higher uptake than now, too many businesses would be too deeply invested in it to just abandon it. They'd just have to grin and bear it. Sure, the price would take a hit, but there's no guarantee it would drop to "near zero" as you claim.
And as I said elsewhere, the attack will still be profitable even if the price crashes by half, because the malicious group has doubled their block rewards.
@_date: 2015-06-20 09:11:33


You don't, and all that means is that this test is *even more realistic*, as you now realise there can be an economic incentive to attack the network in this way.

Sentencing does nothing whatsoever to repair the damage, so there is very little reason it should be connected. Sentencing is there to create a disincentive for people to try the same thing.


No, it's the exact opposite, there. Those are about *intent*. And in this case, the intent was just as bad as it gets.

@_date: 2015-06-05 20:24:32


I already did: It made getting drugs be simpler, which would reasonably increase sales, which give cartels more money and more power, as it was still the cartels supplying most of them.
Had it been limited to, say, people growing their own pot and selling it, it would have been an entirely different story. But it wasn't. It was very much part of the established drug distribution system.
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:59:39
Or perhaps because it was unprofitable.
Actually, we don't have to guess. It was because it was unprofitable.
@_date: 2015-06-03 13:19:52


Thinking further on it, it's not really the degree of damage that differs between those cases, though. It is the amount of *potential* damage that we can *prove* was likely. If someone drives home drunk and makes it, it's hard to make a convincing argument that he could potentially have killed tens of people when he passed a bus on a dark road, because nobody may even have noticed this incident happening. It is not fair to sentence him for this incident, as it is essentially unprovable.
The probability of him causing the damage should probably also be taken into account. And we do not really have a way to determine that probability.
So in the end, we have to fall back on damage caused, even though this is an imperfect measure.
@_date: 2015-12-06 16:20:19
So why would the price plummet, again?
@_date: 2015-06-14 08:32:41


Yes they can. They can collude to stop accepting transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-06 15:18:42
Consider this: A number of large mining farms band together in a pool and get 51%, and stop building on anyone else's blocks. Suddenly, every miner not on their pool will receive zero bitcoins for their mining.
What do you imagine other miners would do? They basically have three options:
* Join the winners on their terms. Malicious pool grows even stronger.
* Stop mining. Malicious pool grows even stronger.
* Try to band together, invest in more hashing power to get more than the malicious miners, and take them down, all while receiving no block rewards.
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:07:48


I'm pretty sure that if that is what you wanted to let him know, you'd respond to his ticket.

@_date: 2015-06-02 17:28:51
That would depend on how much death and suffering it caused in practice.
But no, we're talking about having people murdered, versus having people murdered and *also* running a global drug marketplace. That is pretty obviously worse.
@_date: 2015-06-15 12:17:52
They have, however, *not done it now*.
@_date: 2015-06-14 22:20:27


Could you though? If you spaced out your faked blocks so that difficulty would never rise, then by the time you reached present time you'd have fewer blocks than the real blockchain, since it on average has been getting blocks more often than once every ten minutes.

No, you could not. You making a universal claim, I am making an existential one.
@_date: 2015-12-07 09:20:00
The point of the 51% attack is that at that point, you can choose to stop building on top of anyone else's blocks, and only do your own. Since you have more hashing power than anyone else, your private chain will eventually be the longest, and everyone else's blocks will be orphaned. That means you have full control of what goes onto the blockchain, and you get all rewards, while everybody else gets zero. This either forces them out of business, or forces them to join you.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:18:15

Which, again and again, the Silk Road *did not change*. You just have to accept that as a given for now. Drugs *are* illegal, and a highly destructive and dangerous market exists as a result. Silk Road did not weaken this, it made it stronger.

Thinking that is an actual risk that is significant is exactly what the judge called privileged about that argument.


No, but you are claiming it did more good than evil, or else your argument is nonsense. And you have no proof whatsoever of that. The only reasons you think so is that it made the tiny fraction of the drug business that *you personally* might come into contact with go away, and you have very little regard for the rest of it, as it does not affect you personally.
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:04:18
If you would take a minute to listen instead of hurling around insults to make yourself feel clever, let me explain what I am saying here:
There are, I am well aware, thousands of cases where Paypal has treated people terribly and screwed them over. This is not in dispute.
However, there are also millions and millions of cases where Paypal has *not* done so. This should also not be in dispute by any sensible person.
The ratio of cases where Paypal has screwed someone over to those where it has acted honourably is miniscule. There are many orders of magnitude of difference between the two.
*Thus*, given a case where Paypal has not yet screwed someone over and saying "Oh they will screw him over any minute now! Look at their past behaviour!" is utter nonsense that completely disregards the actual known data in favour of an emotional argument that essentially boils down to "I really feel that Paypal are thieves and bastards so it must be true!"

They can also just decide that all block rewards will go to them and them only. And that also means that they will be creating all blocks. Which further means they can block transactions as much as they want and if anyone notices, there's not much they can do about it unless they can gather enough hashing power for their own 51% attack. Which they most likely can't, since they won't be getting any block awards until they do.

But it isn't. And Silk Road changed none of that. It just ignored it, and went along with it, and profited from them being illegal, and caused even more damage.


Because what you described *isn't what Silk Road was*. Silk Road was very much part of the illegal and harmful system.
*Should* drugs become legal, then something like Silk Road could very well exist without causing damage. But they aren't, yet. I know you feel this is unfair, and I do, too. But the Silk Road did nothing to further that cause.

Well, that was a pretty bad way to make that point, then. The internet in 1980 ran on far more reliable equipment than acoustic modems.
Acoustic modems, in fact, are a technology essentially unrelated to the internet. Towards the end of its lifetime, it was pressed into service as an unreliable way to get regular people onto the internet. In fact, acoustic modems only grew more unreliable the faster they got. They were finally killed off once ADSL was developed to replace them entirely, and everybody was thankful to finally be rid of them.
So if you want to compare bitcoin to acoustic modems, you're essentially saying it will get worse and worse until something else comes along to replace it.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:24:46


Those are trivial comparisons with pretty much zero value.
My interest is in how willing bitcoiners are to twist and stretch the truth to fit their narrative, and how unwilling anyone is to challenge any claim that is positive for bitcoin.

Problem is, in reality, where most of us prefer to live, you get dangerous to others long before you get to the "weaving around" level of drunk.

Not in countries implementing them properly. If you do it wrong, sure, it can be manipulated. That says nothing, though, expect that it is very hard to get right.

If there is a machine reading anything, you're already doing it wrong.

You don't see having a central authority who decides which transactions are allowed as a bad thing? Because that's what they become. They may not exercise that power at first, but they have the option, and you rely on their good will.


Once they reach 51% and start this strategy, everybody else's mining profits drop to zero. That is going to cause a massive loss of mining power opposing them. At that point, they are entrenched, and unseating them takes an incredible effort and investment.

Then, "realisticfemale88"... That's not a name anyone would pick, would they? Unless they were making fun people who refer to women as "females". And the picture is... some kind of realistic woman? Is there a joke there at all? There's no longer a contrast between name and picture.
Then "satoshi_nakamoto" and... A picture of Satoshi Nakamoto in more traditional Japanese clothes? I've already lost the thread because of the three preceding pictures didn't really share a theme, so I can't guess what the punchline is supposed to be any longer.
The setup doesn't lead you into the punchline, and the punchline is unclear.

Because it was impossible to get USD out, so USD on Mt Gox is worth less than real USD. Thus, the price is higher in MtGox-USD.

2. They did know drugs were being sold, as it was trivial to find them.
3. They did not remove the drugs, thus they were actively allowing those sales.
Thus, any argument that they somehow were not aware they were running a site for selling drugs is utterly ludicrous.

Sure, but you're not selling a product to the buyers. You are selling it to the sellers. The buyers would like to get their tickets for free, ideally, and they'd love you if you gave them that, but no seller will want that. For better or worse, you're going to have to offer the sellers what benefits them, not the buyers.
And the point is, there's no benefit to the seller that users can sell tickets to each other, really. So they don't need that. The only thing you're offering that they might want is an auction. And they can have an auction much more simply by, as you say, delegating the work to a third party who arrange it and deal with the work it requires. And that third party doesn't need the blockchain, either, it offers them nothing of value.
So it's still not clear that you are offering anything of value here to the people who would pay you for it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:10:03

3. Not letting anyone else use your vote.

That one happened much earlier, long before they announced the problem, and was a focused attack aimed at Mt Gox only. The widespread attack was someone else learning the trick and aiming it at everyone for shits and giggles, and probably using a slightly different method.

What they suggest is pretty much physically impossible, which means they never even figured out *why* they got hacked, or else they are lying about it.

Because it is really, really hard to secure a modern computer. And there's very little incentive to do it. Nobody can tell if your exchange is secure or not, and you can always cut and run if it goes bad.
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:54:32
Transactions reference outputs, not addresses, so no, this doesn't work this way. In fact, lots of people do use a single address that is re-used for change transactions, and you can't steal all the money from those once they send you a payment.
It is done because re-using an adress makes it theoretically slightly less secure. This is not a problem in practice currently, but people try to avoid it just to be on the safe side.

No, it is exactly the same. You can't lend out *actual cash* that you don't have, yet banks give bigger loans than they have cash at hand for all the time.
They just rely on you not asking for the actual bills, but letting it stay in their ledgers.

@_date: 2014-03-04 08:35:51


Slightly misleading. It has 53 bits of precision for *binary* values. This makes no difference when storing integer values in a double, it can represent integers up to 53 bits accurately. But it still can not represent the value 0.1 accurately, as that is a decimal fraction which is not representable as a binary fraction, which doubles use.
You should never, ever use binary floating point to represent currency. Not bitcoins, either.

It means no such thing. Mt Gox was subjected to a *targeted* attack, against them and them only, aimed at stealing money.
The later attack was unrelated, but used the same technique against *everybody*, with no attempt to steal money, just to disrupt operation. That requires less effort.

A large fraction of their hashing power is controlled by them. And moving away from them means giving up on mining profits entirely, while staying with them means doubling your profits.

The real problem is the malleability issue in the Bitcoin protocol. All of these fixes (by everyone, including the Satoshi client, not just Mt Gox) are just duct tape over that fundamental problem, which is very hard to fix. People are working on it, but have to do so very carefully, so it takes a long time.

@_date: 2014-02-16 01:27:01
Well, no, the glitch *did* make a hack possible. Mt Gox most likely lost money to it. It just requires some bad code on the site's end.
Whether that *actually* happened is another question. I don't believe it for a second, but not because there is anything impossible about it.

Well, that's what people said several years ago, and it hasn't happened yet, although the price is now far higher and more people are involved.
@_date: 2014-11-01 21:55:07
So... 5 months of decline and 7 months of recovery.
Compared to... 11 months of decline, no recovery in sight yet.
Maybe not quite time to be smug yet.

It's their fault for not working around a known bug, but that doesn't mean there isn't still a bug in the Bitcoin protocol. The devs will be the first to tell you that, and they do, in the threads related to this issue.
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:40:58

Except most of their users are running on hardware they are renting from the pool operators in the first place. So they can't really leave.

@_date: 2014-06-09 11:04:13
So you admit it can happen, through entirely rational behaviour?
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:32:10
Hash algorithms aren't usually suddenly fully broken, they just get weakened bit by bit, so you have time to move on before they become practically attackable.
But with a huge investment into one specific algorithm, that would mean people would be unwilling to move on quickly enough.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:11:56
"Shared", not "shard". Even if that would make some kind of intuitive sense, too.
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:25:38
A signature is useless without a public key to check it against, though. And if people have your public key, they know how you voted by checking the signature.

That's something completely different from what you just said.

That's much the same conclusion I've come to, too.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:43:59
Also, it doesn't prove even that, since they have not released the information needed to actually verify the proof.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:49:14


There is no real reason to. The user can't tell the difference until the site goes belly-up, and bitcoiners in particular seem willing to bend over backwards to forgive acts of utter incompetence. There's pretty much zero pressure on anyone to clean up their act.


At which point it's *too late*.

@_date: 2014-06-09 21:54:27


Wrong. You cannot maintain a *defence* against a 51% attack! Block rewards are *gone* once a 51% attack is in effect. Anyone fighting it will be doing so out of their own pocket. Once miners start shutting down because they no longer get any rewards, and the price is plummeting anyway, the 51% attacker only grows stronger.

The difference here is that there is a reasonable scenario: They never covered the costs, and are running a fractional reserve. This has happened before with other exchanges.


And that history says: They have been hacked, and they don't even know why, or are lying about it.

There are two things to consider, here: One is that a person buys bitcoins with their own card, and then falsely claims he didn't. The other is that someone steals somebody's credit card, buys bitcoins with it, and then the owner correctly claims he didn't.
So they may have eliminated the former, but they've made the latter much more serious. Especially since their checks are apparently very, very lax. Banks are not going to like having the police getting involved, not at all.

The assumption here is that you just want to buy bitcoins and never use them for anything. This makes people happy because it runs up the price of their bitcoins.

That is the one. It makes no effort whatsoever to do this, and that is catastrophical for a voting system.


It's not that it isn't improved. It's that it is massively weakened, which makes it entirely unsuitable as a democratic voting method.

Not really. The Trezor has a far simpler firmware and software stack that can more easily be hardened. So while it is indeed possible it could be attacked that way, "just as easily" does not apply.
The main principle of making computer systems secure is decreasing the attack surface. And your device has a much larger one than the Trezor has, currently.

There is no expectation that that field should be malleable. It was not *meant* to be malleable, that was basically a mistake in the protocol design. It was a known mistake, but it certainly was not widely known or well documented, as people like to claim in hindsight.
Not even the core developers themselves were fully aware of its implications, as we can see from the fact that the reference client still had some bugs relating to it.

The rest of the *miners* can't do anything. You need a hard-forked client, and you need it installed on most nodes. That pretty much means you're begging the bitcoin devs to intervene for you.
Also, even if you did it, you'd be stealing money out of the pockets of the exchanges where they cashed out their profits.
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:20:22
That would be a great comparison if it wasn't for the fact that bitcoins do get stolen. A lot. Much more than those things.

Completely and utterly invalid analogy.

No. Once you have 51%, you can just stop including anybody else's blocks in the chain, and only mine on top of your own blocks, and your chain will still get longer than everybody else's, effectively locking everyone else out of mining.
You have the *choice* to still be honest and only take 51%, but it's merely a choice.

He chooses whether or not to upgrade to the new version of the software which includes the incompatible change.


After the change takes place (usually, such a change would be introduced into the code ahead of time, with a time limit on when it becomes active, to allow everybody to upgrade before the change), anybody running an old client would start working a second block chain, diverged from the first. If most mining power has moved to the other chain, this new chain would move very slowly due to a mismatch between the difficulty level and the amount of mining power remaining.

There's no way whatsoever for a consumer to know if either is happening.

That's not what the fees are now, and that's certainly not what the fees will be should bitcoin grow to anything remotely resembling the size of the banking networks.

That's nonsense.
The exact same is true of regular currencies, *as long as you demand to be paid in cash*. There's no debt involved once you're holding actual cash.
Bitcoin is cash that can be exchanged through the internet. *However*, just as the existence of cash does not stop fractional reserve banking, there's also nothing stopping somebody from doing fractional reserve banking denominated in bitcoin. They might have some trouble finding anyone to take them up on it, but that is entirely a social issue, and also entirely independent from the fact that they use bitcoin.

Except when you have 1% of the currency circulating, and 99% hoarded, then it can *and will* crash terribly as soon as somebody wants to cash out.

Not really.

The part that matters, yes. The other bits are trivial to figure out.


No. They *don't* know how to fix it! How could they, when their explanation makes no sense? 


This is the part that makes no sense: The old one was just as secure. Making a new one when you don't know how you leaked the old isn't fixing the problem.


Where are you getting that part?

The real takeaway here is:
K value reuse is a *fucking scary* vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol. It is far, far too easy to *accidentally* lose all your security through simple programming mistakes, which may not even be in code you are responsible for writing.
This is *not* a good part of the protocol here, and it really should be replaced.

Well, you have plenty of people in here who want no regulation, and free markets, and keep saying that will make people more careful with their money, and it's up to themselves to protect themselves.
Consequently, when things go bad, you can't suddenly claim to not be responsible. It was your job to make sure you knew what you were doing, and that includes being ready to deal with everything going to shit and having no protection from it.

They themselves claim that it was "16 uppercase, lowercase letters and digits". Also, you generally don't get to pick API keys yourself, they are generated for you and always random.
And even so, at 16 characters, even if it was a word with added numbers, that's pretty much uncrackable over the net, and you can't brute force an API key locally.

Wrong. You can take 100% of mining profits with 51% of the hashing power. Just refuse to include other people's blocks in the chain. Yours will eventually grow longer than theirs, and theirs will be discarded.

If only they accept these transactions, they won't transmit for hours or days at a time, unless 21 is planning to do a 51% attack. It will also mean they will run out of capacity much quicker than the already incredibly low limit of 2.7 transactions a second.

Because it uses up a lot of space in the block chain. And because transfer fees would eat up a large percentage of the money for micropayments.
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:20:10


That is a very misleading statement. Fees *are*, in practice, set by the miner, as they can choose not to include transactions that they feel do not have a sufficient fee.


You can withhold as long as you want if you can just keep producing blocks faster than everyone else. Once you release all your blocks and they are longer than the current chain, they will replace it.


It was not a test, and somebody most definitely lost money, for a while. The person who did it used it to blackmail a service into paying him money he was owed. Once they did, he refunded the double spend. He could easily have not done that.


Completely irrelevant to your argument.
@_date: 2015-05-20 09:46:18

No, that's the thing. A truly malicious attacker that gets 51% can shut down the network pretty much permanently.
Once you get more than 50%, you always build only on your own blocks. Every single block by someone else will be treated as a fork, and since you have more than 50%, on average you will always have the longest chain.
So nobody else's blocks get included, which means nobody else get mining rewards. This will cause all big mining operations to quickly go out of business, as you cut off their entire revenue stream. These people could try to take back the network by deploying more hashing power, but how long can they keep doing that with zero income? If you have deep pockets, you are guaranteed to win that race, too.
And once all blocks are mined by you, you can just stop including transactions, and the network shuts down.

Dictionary attacks are feasible on words on reasonable size, but 16 characters is still not really in range, not with randomised elements added. It wasn't bruteforced, that is pretty much certain.

If you don't need to be on the blockchain on time, why do you need the blockchain or bitcoin at all?

Of course "malleability" isn't being "fixed", as it's a part of the protocol. The protocol needs to change for that to be fixed, and that is happening but slowly. None of the fixes being done here or at Mt Gox is "fixing malleability". It is fixing bugs that are triggered by the presences of malleability. At Mt Gox as well as in the Satoshi client.

The socks in my drawer do.
Or if you'd prefer, cryptocurrency units do not have a limited supply either, as you can create as many new currencies as you'd like.
You are claiming that there is a limited supply of *specifically* Bitcoins, and thus they have value. I am saying there's a limited supply of *specifically* the socks in my drawer, and that that is not sufficient to give them value.
A limited supply is a *necessary* but not at all a *sufficient* condition for having value. Bitcoins being rare is not, on its own, going to make them valuable. There has to be a demand for them, too. And if people do nothing with them but hold them, that demand will eventually disappear.

Of course it matters. Their own holdings will probably be in BTC, and thus they will be losing lots of personal money all the time. That makes it a lot more tempting to steal some more and get out of the game.
It also means their future is uncertain, as people will lose interest if the price drops.
@_date: 2015-01-12 10:07:54
I'm not really convinced I've ever seen such a thing, though.
Just to explore the topic, could you point me to a site which I can somehow get some level of confidence that it is secure? Any site will do.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:49:47
In other words, they don't have confidence in BTC, thus would be more likely to cut and run when things look bad?

Oh, my mistake. Totalitarianism, then.
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:37:57
You're a bit confused about what that says.
First, it says that they will stop accepting *outside* miners. This means the fraction of power they directly control will be *larger*, which just makes the problem worse.
Second, they promise to implement a feature that lets people *who rent their hardware* to select another pool, *voluntarily*. They are not redirecting anyone, they are allowing people to redirect themselves. And only on hardware which is under their control.
And as a response points out, they haven't even done it yet.
So no, they don't do what you say.
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:47:00
Sounds like they'd just include the transactions involving old coins, then. That is a little bit less bad, but still a catastrophe.
@_date: 2014-02-12 11:44:53


You are confusing events. There were, apparently, pinpoint focused attacks against Mt Gox in the past. These probably resulted in Mt Gox losing money. This, in turn, led to withdrawals from Mt Gox failing, because they were trying to send money that was stolen. In the uproar about what had caused this, somebody started a non-targeted attack against everyone, for unclear reasons. This person is likely not the same one who committed the initial attack.

No, it wouldn't. It would just hide the real problem, since you could no longer seen when one operator is getting too much mining power, that they can at any time redirect to whatever purpose they want.

Not if you actually want to trust them.


They aren't in danger of being hit because people aren't actually using Bitcoin for microtransactions on a large scale.


Much better than credit cards is an extremely low bar to hit. However, it is much worse than a simple centralised service you control yourself, which you can run with no fees per transaction.

No, nobody needs to do anything. The network itself is what puts pressure on them. Any alternative implementation has to match Bitcoin Core bug-by-bug, or else get excluded from the consensus as soon as one of those bugs is triggered.

That is the point here. OP knew there was a chance he'd take part in credit card fraud. He decided to go ahead anyway, because he'd profit from it if it happened.

No, a miner already has the block he just produced, so block size of a block you produced yourself does not affect you negatively.
However, a large block size will affect *every other* miner negatively, as they will have to wait to download it. The miner who produced it gets a head start, and the head start is bigger the bigger the block is.
Thus, miners have an incentive to create *big* blocks.

No, you did not. *Every single person* who has ever seen a paper wallet has control of the funds contained in there *forever*. You receive a paper wallet, but you can never give it away. You always remain in control of it.
If you accept a paper wallet from somebody, you are trusting him not to use his control over it to take the coins back before you can take them.
@_date: 2015-07-20 10:23:39
You claimed he knew *nothing* about it, and that he took "precautions". Neither is true.

This is not about being "worried", is it? It is about actively taking part in the actions of the crime, which you have a choice of doing or not doing.
If you make the choice to do so, knowing that it is likely to be a crime, that is unethical.

If indeed. See, that question was about specifics. What evidence that was presented to the jury is now a problem?
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:56:53


No, for the millionth time, no, that is not what I am proposing, that would be ludicrous. Why do you keep coming back to this time and again after I tell you that is not what I am saying? Could you please make a little more of an effort to listen to what I am actually saying?
There is a difference between suspecting a crime is happening, and suspecting a crime is happening **and taking part in it**.
The taking part in it is the important part. Receiving stolen property is, by every legal and moral standard, taking part in the crime. You will not always be punished for it, because you can always argue that you did not know of the crime, but here we are talking about someone who *does suspect it*, yet chooses to receive it anyway, and makes no effort to confirm that said property is not stolen, and in fact expresses an interest using said property as quickly as possible if it were in fact stolen, so that he will not be the one who ends up losing it.
@_date: 2015-07-13 09:49:41
Yes, that is the one I am referring to. It is something people have been saying here for years, and everybody thought they were right.

You keep trying to rephrase the situation to be completely different.
If you want to make an eBay comparison, here is the relevant one:
If you see an item on eBay, and you can tell from the price and circumstances that it is most likely stolen, are you morally wrong if you go ahead and buy it anyway?
The answer should be pretty obviously "yes".

Indeed it would. If he did the same thing with a much lower rate, I would not call anyone who believed it stupid.
But the thing is, if he offered a much lower rate, he wouldn't have gotten anywhere near as many takers, and it wouldn't have really paid off much as a scam.

As I said, he is a liar. He claimed to use bcrypt, he actually used MD5. He claimed the exploits pointed out in the above thread didn't work, but they did. I assume the part about hiring security experts is also a lie.
In fact, I assume most the things he's saying are lies.
@_date: 2012-02-07 23:46:00
At 10 times the network size, you are still orders of magnitude away from what you are comparing with.

The site is garbage. Multiple people have confirmed this and have exploited it. Alberto is a liar and a fraud.

By changing from fees of a few percent to fees that are slightly lower? How is that supposed to even be noticeable in terms of royalties and prices?

That mechanism has absolutely nothing at all to do with market manipulation.
Furthermore, you are the one who brought up "market manipulation" in the first place. I have not made any mention of it.
Thus, you make no sense and are posting non-sequitors.
@_date: 2012-10-29 22:59:14
So you're saying that being fair, reputable and established isn't enough to know if you should do business with someone, then.

So does that mean that if I want to accept a payment through ripple, it is up to *me* to go through the chain to find out who is offering that credit, and then decide each time if I want to trust them or not?
@_date: 2012-01-07 18:52:55
And this one wasn't very strong at all, so, "good riddance".
@_date: 2012-04-05 20:04:44

@_date: 2012-07-31 10:44:11
Yeah, it's too bad I'm not as *super logical* as the guy I was responding to!
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:09:22


Of course. If you want to accuse me of hypocrisy, how about you first actually find something that I have done, rather than just slyly imply that I may have done some hypocritical? That is pretty pathetic.
And whether or not I am hypocritical, whether or not there are pedophiles anywhere else, Amir Taaki still, by his own admission, pimped out underage kids online. No matter how much you attack me, that fact is not going to change, so I suggest you find a better way to deal with it.
@_date: 2012-08-16 23:23:01


Again: So? That's a pointless minor tangent. Just from the things he's done here right now with bitdaytrade, he is either staggeringly incompetent and should never be trusted with any money, or he is directly malicious.


@_date: 2012-09-30 12:53:04

You'll be happy to provide us with the link to the transaction, then, and the correct address?

Then why exactly are we still seeing *renders* of it, when it's supposed to be shipping soon?
@_date: 2012-08-16 01:27:26
You changed it so it won't work any more, and then you lied about it.
That is incredibly shitty behavior.
Too bad you didn't fix all the other similar issues, so I can easily tell you are lying.
@_date: 2012-09-09 13:12:54
If you didn't want a snarky response, you should not have started off with one yourself. You have no moral high ground to claim there.
@_date: 2012-01-07 22:13:24
And this one got destroyed thanks to that.
Also, if you support merged mining, you have to be pretty similar to the original bitcoin anyway and won't add much of interest.

No, it's pretty obvious they don't, actually. Their software has so many incredibly obvious security holes that if Bitcoinica was running the same thing, nobody would have needed to do anything as elaborate as hacking a hosting service to steal its money.

You are *continuing* to attack those who initially just wanted to help you do your job properly, instead of thanking them for what they taught you, like a sane person would.
Personally, I have no idea who Jonathan Ryan Owens even is, and he certainly had *nothing at all* to do with attacks on your site. Nobody needed the source for it to attack it either. It was *just that terrible*.


You have been told this before but you keep ignoring it:
**Not one bitcoin was withdrawn because you were attacked by nice people**, who never wanted to steal anything. If you had been attacked by actual criminals, the outcome would have been **much worse**.
And this is **all your own fault**. You really should realize this, and stop digging yourself deeper into ridicule.

Despite all the defensive claims to the contrary, it is actually completely arbitrary busy work. The point of the system is to force people to do time-consuming work to throttle the rate at which blocks can be created.

This is because miners currently make enough from newly created coins, and are therefore not demanding anything. Yet.

You could just read the thread and find out, but seeing as how the people posting in the thread aren't doing that either, I guess there's not much chance of that.
The reason this was brought up at all was for one hypothetical scenario only: If ECDSA is broken, all bitcoin wallets become insecure. In this case, all coins in circulation must be transferred to new wallets using another algorithm. However, lost coins can not be transferred, and will instead be up for grabs by crackers.
Therefore, the question was, in such a situation, should there be a possibility to destroy (and not recycle) all untransfered coins, in order to prevent them from suddenly coming back into circulation in the hands of random thieves?
@_date: 2012-09-15 14:57:32

Vanity bitcoin addresses are somewhat terrible, security-wise. If somebody wants to trick people into paying money to them instead of to you, they can generate an address that looks just like yours, for the vanity part. As that part is the only thing people remember, they will more easily fall for this than for a randomized address, as hardly anybody bothers remembering those at all.

How would that help? All multi-signature transactions allow you to do is have a second server that does sanity checks on the transactions. It still has to approve them, though, or nobody gets their money. It's easy to secure the bitcoin faucet, because there are obvious sanity checks to do: Only allow payments of a few pennies at a low rate.
But how *do* you perform sanity checks on payouts from a mining pool? The most you can do is limit the rate of withdrawals a bit and hope you can catch the thief in the act before he empties out the account.

* The depth chart is unusable anyway because it goes all the way up to $37.00, because it includes nonsense bids.
* The "Last price" text touches the edge of the page, as do the boxes around Bid/Ask and the Depth Chart. That looks terribly sloppy.
* Changing the Market popup causes a full reload of the entire page, which is very slow.

Sure you do, if you trade with them. Or if you do statistical matching of data from other sources. There are plenty of ways to extract a lot of information out of the transaction history. You can find out a lot more than you can with regular money.


Then why did you suggest to use them for evading taxes earlier?


I'm not sure what you think I said, but this sure doesn't seem like a reply to it.


Before your currency can be in widespread use, you have to convince people to use it even though it *isn't* in widespread use yet. You can't just say "oh this will get better!", you have to show how it is better *right now*.

Impossible. There are many, many thousands of voting stations, and it is *very* hard to be sure any given computer is *actually* running the code it claims to run.
The issues are: Prevent anybody at any stage of the voting process from having a realistic chance to falsify the result. Also, make sure voting is *completely* anonymous and otherwise immune to coercion.
Pen and paper voting in closed booths, with representatives of all parties and outsiders supervising the voting process and vote counting does a pretty good job of this. Improving on this is *extremely* hard, especially if you involve computers, as they are by their nature extremely hard to trust.

I can do that with real money, too. Paypal exists, and works.


That transaction history sure isn't very anonymous, especially not if you bring some statistic analysis to bear on it. It's pseudonymous at best (and that best case is unlikely), and even then everybody has access to all transaction data, unlike other forms of money where no one person or entity has access to *all* transactions.


Or small. It's as big as the fees are.
And again, by spending your BTC instead of hoarding them, you are forfeiting the extra income you'd have from the deflation. So you do lose money by spending BTC, even if it is not called "fees".


That is illegal, and I am not really interested in breaking the law.


This is clearly not about *me*. It is about everyone: Once anybody has some BTC, why should they spend it instead of hoard it? If everyone just hoards, nothing will work.

And as the value of bitcoin keeps dropping, it seems this community is steadily changing for the worse.

If you are, you're not buying your "dev kits" off Amazon. I know, I've been involved in buying dev kits before.


Of course you do. If you're going to invest into creating a service, you will want to make one that is actually useful and makes sense to offer to the user base, and for that you need to have some idea of who the user base actually *is*.


But it is not. Bitcoin is specifically designed to cancel out such technological advances. If mining gets cheaper and uses less power, difficulty will rise to compensate. Mining is designed to always be expensive, no matter the available technology.


No such thing exists, or has been announced, though. You're just speculating.

I can make some pretty valid guesses, though. For instance, I can guess that devices powered by solar panels will want to do nothing remotely like mining bitcoins, as that is basically trading power for money, and those devices will be struggling to find any power at all, and definitely won't have any left over to trade for money. Especially not the miniscule amounts they could get.


This just makes no sense. Since when is wanting a *smaller* amount of money going to lead to it being more difficult?


It is the *only* thing this particular device brings you, though. Anything else it does can be done better by other, much cheaper devices.


That is not something this device does.

@_date: 2015-11-30 12:05:39


Essentially, yes. Selling a "dev kit" on Amazon looks very odd. It most definitely make it seem to *actually* be meant as a consumer product, since it's sold on a consumer market.


But this example is nonsensical. Nobody would want this service, since you are not offering any guarantees whatsoever. You can not rely on it for anything at all, so you have no reason to want to pay for it.
To make an actual viable product, you need to know actual use cases, and you need to figure out how to solve those in a way that people are willing to pay for. You can't do this without knowing who your users even are.




So what you're saying is, this product is not viable until there are millions or billions of them on the market.


So now the device itself will no longer be mining coins after all. It will get them from somewhere else.
Why, again, do I not want to just pay a small sum to provide my device with bitcoins and skip the extra hardware?


Remind me again, which percentage of mined coins go to 21 inc?


But you already need to transfer coins around, as you said. Why would I not just want a central account I can fund once, and then all my devices can get their little coins from there?
@_date: 2015-11-16 11:39:38
But why would you want to do that?
@_date: 2015-11-16 12:12:21

It's a process I do all the time, and it does not really bother me most of the time. I certainly wouldn't pay a premium to avoid it. Most of the things you mention are a one-time setup thing, too.


Because you're the one who claimed market rates.


Once I've set a device up and bought a small stash of coins once, it can be just as automated without any of the expensive and power-hungry hardware, too.

First, you'll want a bit more than "pretty sure". You have a vague implication this will happen at some indeterminate point in the future. This is not a basis to build a business on.
Second, the idea that it would be in smartphones and tablets seems *highly* suspect. They do *not* have the power to spare for a power-hungry bitcoin mining chip.

Yeah, when you say that, what you actually mean is "reduction is me having to meet up with people I am vaguely afraid would kill me for no reason rather than sell me drugs".
In reality, nearly all the harm in the drug business happens on the supply side, which the Silk Road *increased*, and on the side of the users, which the Silk Road also most likely increased.
Claiming it reduced harm is living in a completely self-centred and wilfully ignorant fantasy.

I haven't given up any privacy. You can't tell who I am from that IBAN number.


They will not, because they *can't do anything with an IBAN number*, other than give me money, which I wouldn't terribly mind.
Somebody could conceivably try to social-engineer the bank to get at my account, but they'll need a lot more than my IBAN for that, and having the IBAN probably doesn't make much of a difference there if my bank is that careless. Generally, I've had good experiences with them being very strict about checking my identification before making any changes at all or divulging any information.
And if they do manage it, the responsibility falls on my bank. They will be the ones who have to reimbuse me for lost money. My IBAN number is not a secret I am supposed to keep, it is something I give out freely to anyone who needs to pay me money.
@_date: 2011-06-22 18:06:04


Why do you think it is impossible to just look at the transaction history and follow money being moved around?


Tax evasion is illegal. The law does not care if you do it through offshore banking or through virtual currencies.


Sure, if that were the case. It works fairly well for drugs, apparently.
But in practice, there are more vendors who will take USD.

It does not. There's no majority involved in the two generals problem, it's just two people trying to communicate over an unreliable link.


I am trying to tell you that you made a claim which is not true. You said that Satoshi solved the two generals problem. He did not. That is just something the internet likes to claim in its hero worship of him, without understanding what the problem actually *is*.
What Bitcoin solves is not the two generals problem, it's the Byzantines generals problems, which is a separate but related problem, and it does not actually solve it, it provides a probabilistic solution which works *a lot of the time*. However, that solution is not a valid solution to the two generals problem, which remains unsolved and is most likely unsolvable.

The extra price of the hardware, the extra power usage, and the sizeable fraction of bitcoins paid to 21 inc.


Why would they buy them from coinbase? We're already using 21 inc's centralised system, so they can just sell us coins too.

Except that if a smaller amount of coins are artificially inflated in value that way, that makes the currency much more unstable, and at risk of a massive crash once people start cashing out.

If you moved money out of your cold storage with an Android client, or with Blockchain.info, and you had bad luck, that money could have been stolen even though nobody else ever touched your cold storage.

No, that risk will always be there. Because if blockchain.info is compromised, you don't know what Javascript code they might be serving up. The code could easily decrypt your wallet client-side, then quietly send it to the server without you realizing.

You construct a block for the blockchain by taking some valid transactions, adding one that creates 25 coins for yourself, bunching them all together, and then using that as input for the hashing algorithm. Then you start guessing numbers until you get one that will be accepted by the network.
You don't *have* to include any transactions other than the one to award yourself money. People have mined blocks without transactions. Generally, people are nice and don't do that. (Also, you are allowed to keep the transaction fees of all the transactions you include, so that's some extra money.)

"FPGA" just means the chip itself. There aren't any FPGA chips specifically for bitcoin. There are some boards for bitcoin mining built with general-purpose FPGAs. The FPGAs themselves can be programmed to do anything, but as the boards have little other hardware or connections on them, they are not that useful for anything other than bitcoin mining and similar tasks.
You don't need one of those boards, though you can just take a regular FPGA development board and use that, but how well it will work depends on the specific chip, and if somebody has gotten the code to run on it. Also, the price might be higher because development systems can be expensive.

It doesn't go against anything. It is just using the Bitcoin protocol just like everyone else.
Bitcoin is meant to work whether or not you are doing something that it "stands for" or not. If you have to trust people to not do the wrong thing, Bitcoin is doomed, because you can't stop people from doing the wrong thing if they want to, and have the ability.
It doesn't matter if Coinvalidation does this or not. If it's possible, and there is a demand for it, someone else will do it if they don't. And if there is no demand for it, there's no reason to worry about it.

No, you can have an address with 1 coin in it, and then you can create two transactions, each one for one coin from that address, to two different addresses.

It would take long, because scrypt is designed to require large amounts of memory.

None of that helps if it's not you who are registering the account in the first place.
Neither does it help with the case where you accuse the site owner of being fraudulent.

Absolutely and objectively wrong. Alcohol increases reaction times. Driving with increased reaction times is very dangerous and reckless. However, it does not immediately translate into *visible* bad driving. It is only once you get into an unexpected situation that requires quick reactions that you will get into trouble.

You still have not explained how totally de-anonymising the coins actually anonymises them, though.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:01:21
It limits how big a single block can be, and that in turn limits how many transactions can go into a block. Since the block rate is constant, that limits the rate of transactions on the entire network. It is currently not large enough to support a large-scale network.
It can not be changed without making incompatible changes to the network. This is still possible to do, but everyone has to agree, and it has to be coordinated so that the network doesn't split when it happens. The problem is that people will have to first figure out what to change it to that everyone can agree on.

It is not beyond credibility that they may some day create an *electronic* currency. This is not synonymous with a *crypto* currency. A crypto currency, in general, sacrifices efficiency and usability to gain decentralisation. If you don't want decentralisation, there is no reason to make the tradeoff, and a centralised electronic currency needs no clever crypto elements.

Which is why they created several of the biggest and most successful open source projects, clearly.
@_date: 2013-07-19 20:40:49
I found it incredibly confusing too. The confusing part is: Why on earth is this news? Why didn't the guy just go "Oh shit! Wait, he didn't withdraw it again, I'm safe!" right from the start?
Why is there a whole article that explains that someone else had to tell him that he didn't actually lose any money? That is completely and utterly obvious.

Thermos has said in the past that he likes to take part in Ponzi schemes as a form of gambling, to try to get out before it crashes.
Gambling's supposed to be done between people who have consented to gambling, though, which you are not doing in a Ponzi scheme. You're just trying to get yourself a cut of some sucker's money.
Taking part really shows a severe lack of morality.

@_date: 2013-04-22 11:32:11
Not just mined coins, either. How often do you see people in here bragging that they are "buying and holding"? This basically reduces the supply of bitcoins and artificially raises the price.

Actually, it would do the opposite of that. The issuance is causing inflation which should offset some of the massive deflation. Take away that inflation and it will be even more deflationary.

Large DRAM memories use different technology than the other circuitry on ASICs. You usually include it as an external chip instead. And when you do that, you need a bus to it. That requires a lot of lines.
And the point of ASICs is to do many things in parallel. You can't do that with an external memory on a single bus, because you are limited by the bus bandwidth. So you need multiple chips and multiple buses, but you can't fit more than a few there, physically.
You can include SRAM on the chip itself, but unlike DRAM, SRAM is crazy expensive.

The "except" is in response to this:

@_date: 2013-12-27 10:49:04


Because it is expensive as hell. On-chip cache SRAM is tiny compared to main DRAM, and properly tuned scrypt will require huge amounts of it, far more than your average cache.

How is it a solution? Honest people won't chargeback credit cards, so getting them to use Bitcoin changes nothing.

And Humble Bundle couldn't possibly stop accepting credit cards entirely without ruining their business.

Yes, it is *exactly* his fault. When you are doing crypto code, you do *not* get to blame the programming language random number generator, because you should goddamn well know that one is *not* suitable for crypto use.

Ah yes, the magic word that will soothe the mind.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:09:29


Makes it easier. More centralisation makes corruption easier.


It will verify just fine. The fact that you have a conflicting transaction that was not included in a block will not invalidate the block itself. That would be a way to cause intentional forks otherwise. You just need to get your transaction included in one block, it will verify just fine from then on.


Or if they get a cut of the bribes, they might switch to that pool.

*This is what bitcoiners actually believe.*
@_date: 2013-02-20 21:40:54

Why would they sell off, when the value just keeps going up? In your scenario, it has to rise many orders of magnitude still. The people who hold lots of coins aren't going to want to sell off that future wealth. But if they keep on to it, they will destabilise it massively.

Scrypt, implemented properly, is pretty immune to custom hardware, because it is memory bound. Custom hardware doesn't make the memory you connect to it any faster, so it doesn't make much sense to create custom hardware for it.

This is technically true, in a very carefully stated manner.
The Bitcoin *protocol* is quite secure and probably unhackable. However, if *your computer* is hacked, that doesn't matter, because the attacker can just steal your private keys and impersonate you, and spend your money.

I am not making a decision, nor am I defining a social contract. I am merely stating a fact.
For instance: To maximize profits, you can include only the transactions with the highest fees, and exclude all transactions without fees. However, if you do this, an attacker can freeze the entire network buy buying up enough coins, and then spamming transactions with slightly higher fees than everyone else.
That is why the regular client doesn't make this optimization, but always includes some transactions without fees, even though this is not advantageous for the miner.

It doesn't matter if Coinvalidation does this or not. If they don't, then someone else can do it. If there is a demand for it, it will be done, because Bitcoin is designed in a way that allows it. If you don't like it, you will have to destroy Bitcoin and replace it with something else.

This is useless. You can never trust a bill that is handed to you unless you scan it immediately, withdraw the money, and wait for it to be confirmed.

They can use it whether or not Coinvalidation exists, and they have been able to do so from the time the first block was published.
And it *is* pretty much built into the protocol. They are just using the way the protocol is designed.

And if you're going to do that, why would you want to give it away in the first place? That is only going to dilute the value of what you have.

Unfortunately, ASICs tend to get a lot cheaper the more of them you make. The cost would probably be significantly less than that at the moment.
Actually, now that I check the maths, even just buying devices from Avalon, if we assume they were selling unlimited amounts, would be far, far cheaper than $50 million to get 51%. Probably not even a single million.

Since when is intent arbitrary?


ISPs should not promote or go out of their way to host pirated material. And they don't, so this is not an issue worth discussing.


And I don't really think that is ethically defensible. The minute money starts changing hands, it's far harder to claim any kind of high ground.


Again: You can not compare an ISP and a site that *actively* supports piracy. An ISP may *passively* facilitate it, but that is not its main purpose, nor is it its main line of business, and nor is it its *intent*.

Well, technically, yes. But for a regular bitcoin address, the chance of cracking it is astronomically small. And pretty much any realistic improvement in computing power will only make it go from astronomical to still astronomical.
It's brain wallets that are being attacked, since they are nowhere near as safe, due to using the human brain as a random number generator, rather than a proper cryptographically safe generator.

For the fact that bitcoin is something which, by the fact that it is valuable and irreversible, requires a far higher level of security than a normal PC can reasonably provide.
Sure, it would be nice if PC were more secure. But they aren't. So that is a problem for bitcoin - it is designed to run on a platform that cannot provide the guarantees it requires.

It *is* hardcoded into the protocol. That is why you need a majority consensus to change it, because you have to change the protocol. And once you change the protocol, clients that use the old protocol and clients that use the new protocol will disagree on whether some blocks are valid or not. That creates exactly the same situation as last week, when clients started disagreeing on whether a certain block was valid or not.
Last week it was because of a bug in the database. In the future, it will be because people agree to introduce this incompatibility in order to raise the hardcoded limit.

Limitations will have to be added to 0.8 to make it reject the same blocks that 0.7 rejects. Before that happens, more miners will have to use 0.7 so that if a fork happens again, the 0.7-compatible branch wins right away.
(Also, miners should avoid creating incompatible blocks, but that cannot be relied upon, as a miner might be malicious.)
Interestingly, this means the hard limit has been *halved*. The hard limit will have to be increased sooner or later, and this means that that point suddenly became a lot *sooner*.

No, *if* the protocol lets you do bad things that threaten all of Bitcoin, then Bitcoin is doomed. That is why it is generally designed so you don't have to trust people not to do bad things, but rather disallow it.
*If* you think this is a bad thing that threatens Bitcoin, then it follows that Bitcoin is doomed, because you can't stop it. The protocol explicitly allows this kind of thing.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:23:14

@_date: 2013-03-10 13:09:03
Chargebacks don't happen randomly distributed over all distributions. They happen because someone tries to steal from you. The people who are trying to steal from you won't use bitcoins, they will just keep using credit cards. Bitcoins do not help you at all there, unless you stop accepting credit cards entirely, which you realistically can't do.

Currently, without hard changes to the protocol, Bitcoin can only scale to less than four times its current transaction volume.
There is a hard and a soft limit on the size of any individual block. The hard limit is one megabyte, the soft limit is 250k. The soft limit is just an arbitrary limit in how big blocks the client will create. This limit has been reached. It can, however, be raised without anybody complaining. However, blocks larger than the hard limit would be rejected by other nodes.
The blockchain fork and ensuing chaos that happened the other day is what happens if clients start to disagree on what blocks can be accepted.
In fact, the fork the other day was caused by a bug that in practice lowered the hard block size limit for some clients. To avoid this happening again, all clients will have to be updated to include the same limitations. This means that in practice, the hard limit is now *less* than one megabyte.
The hard limit will have to be raised if bitcoin keeps growing. The hard part is to get people to agree on how and when to do it while minimizing the risk of another blockchain fork.

Completely unrealistic. A killer feature would most likely require a hard fork of the block chain, something which takes lots of time to get everyone to agree is a good idea, and even so, everyone might *not* agree, and then it's just not happening.
A killer feature may even be completely incompatible with the core design of bitcoin, and may thus be impossible on the network as it exists today.

Everybody has been extremely tight-lipped about how *exactly* they are getting these chips. It's always seemed highly unlikely they designed them themselves.

You can say "rational" investment would continue as much as you like, though, but any investment would have to gain you more value than just sitting on the money, otherwise it is not rational.
And that criterion is a lot harder to meet when your currency is deflating. That means that it only makes sense to invest in spectacularly profitable enterprises. And that in turn means that when you want to start up a modest, sensible business with modest profits, you can't get a loan, because it's not worth investing in you.

Generally, Amazon already has the trust of the credit card companies, so they have more flexibility. And they also just have to accept some level of fraud.

The spammer even admitted to it in this thread. There's no question about whether or not he broke the rules any more.

"Like all the others"? The NSA has been hacking many companies entirely without their knowledge or cooperation.

See, the thing I was getting at there is, nobody has ever gotten any money out of a bitcoin company in a court anywhere.
@_date: 2013-09-02 23:08:40
Because it is clearly safer to use a currency that can drop 25% in hours, rather than one that does it in four months.

"Curating"? Do you even know what that word *means*?
And "participate in the financing or production of new content"? Let's see you give a few examples of pirate sites doing that.

It's pretty amazing how you people absolutely refuse to see the problem with that. Because hey, FREE MONEY!
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:55:30


Not very.


You don't need to specify any particular company, those answers will be true for pretty much every single one.

Yes, even if you look at it in terms of percentages.

You can sure as hell blame them for providing phishers with email addresses.

So because "IP isn't property", artists shouldn't get paid for their work?

Just wait until the user types in the passphrase.
Plus, hot wallets on servers can't easily be encrypted.
@_date: 2013-02-20 11:35:17
You seem to be trying to weasel out of answering this one.
*Should* artists get paid for their work?

Bitcoin is has a userbase with a higher than average ratio of people whose brains aren't quite firing on all cylinders. Also, libertarians.
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:18:57
If that is going to happen, then that means there is a demand for it. If there is a demand for it, it's going to happen no matter if Coinvalidation does it or not.

The topic was not those. It was ones like the one pirateat40 was running, which was as immoral and deceitful as they come.

Not so. Security through obscurity is *not enough*, but sometimes a bit of obscurity does help.
The argument for transparency in crypto security is a strong one, but it is not a universal truth.

You don't really sound particularly sorry.

No, in mid March, they were also saying that they would ship in two weeks. However, they were saying the *first* units would ship in two weeks. You weren't going to get one of the first units.

There is that, but the malicious case is much more important.

Ladies and gentlemen, bitcoin!

You will also not be able to trade with anyone who did update their client, so your defiance is pretty pointless if most others already chose differently from you.

But you can *appear* to drive entirely normally and safely, and *still* be drunk enough to be a danger. Drunk driving isn't dangerous only once you reach the point where you're veering all over the street. Being drunk lowers your reaction time, and can make you cause a horrific accident just from that.
Driving in that state is reckless, but *you can't tell from just looking*. You need to measure it. And how do you propose to do that, without a legal blood alcohol limit?
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:09:54
It tells me that they have people they need to help now and not later. It doesn't tell me anything about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:52:23
No, they could connect. They would just use a *different* blockchain. That is highly problematic.
Also, blocks *were* mined on both chains.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:20:16


Which only shows that the "market cap" is a completely meaningless figure.
It decreases liquidity, increases volatility, which massively decreases the utility of bitcoin as an actual currency.
@_date: 2013-03-17 02:48:44
That has nothing to do with the database.

You don't say.

There is barely any non-free software available for Linux, so no. Not at all. Free, open-source software still has plenty of holes.

You should be aware that you are not talking to the sharpest knife in the drawer, there. Some people are unhappy about having to inhabit the same reality as the rest of us, and instead try to substitute their own.
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:45:30
Yes, but again, as they are talking about the hacks of their internal network, they weren't prevented from talking about that, yes? They are prevented from talking about giving out information by request, but this was not by request.

I just started from one of the transfers in the virus address and clicked on the largest transfers to find it. I found an even shorter path now though:
You can find more of them if you just start from the virus address and click around.

Feel free to point out the part which is evidence that Apple is "highly complicit" in any of it.

But you apparently have no problem at all with the No True Scotsman. You've all but defined your "truly free market" as a market that works the way you *want* it to. That is *one* of your magical assumptions right there.


And here is another magical assumption, right after you said you didn't need any.


And another. You claim this, but you can't even begin to explain *how* this would happen. 
You're just defining a fantasy world that works exactly the way you would like it to.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:39:38
It is slightly safer. It does not hold your private keys.
It can still be hacked, but it's a bit harder.

That is the idea of the plugin, but due to the messy nature of Javascript execution in web browsers, I am not 100% convinced the addon can be completely secure, either.

And that makes it perfectly OK, then.

But when they are in their infancy, blockchains are trivial to attack if you have enough processing power to attack bitcoin as it is now. The required power to attack a new chain is minuscule in comparison.

I don't understand how what you just said is a response to anything I said. I think you may need to go back to the start of this thread and review what is being said:
@_date: 2013-07-10 19:21:17
With all else being constant.
However, with the gradual introduction of ASIC miners, all else is far from constant.

Why would they liquidate them immediately?
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:43:53
Well considering you *don't stop guns at state borders*, comparing US states is utterly meaningless. Banning guns in one state only means criminals can trivially get them in another.
And Swiss guns are *rifles*, not handguns. This is a huge difference. And you are supposed to keep them locked up and never use them.
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:19:43


You've posted zero proof of this claim.
Highly *targeted*, certainly. Complicit, that's another claim entirely.

Depends on who finds it. You don't need source to find exploits, just makes it easier.

The point is, the fact that you even had those problems in the first place should be immensely worrying and a huge warning flag not to trust the site. It doesn't matter how fast they were resolved, they should absolutely not have happened in the first place.

Just like all those other bitcoin scammers have!

It was pretty stable at around $5 for quite some time, and then also around $13. Back then, it was newer and fewer people were using it.

I am not the one trying to tell people India will start using Bitcoin instead of savings accounts, you know?
@_date: 2013-04-20 18:59:18


This is something that everyone knows, except apparently BFL. They have repeatedly, over the better part of year now, made incredibly overconfident plans for shipping, and at no point seem to have ever even considered the idea that they might run into any kind of problems that would take any time at all to solve.
Then, at pretty much every stage, they've run into trouble. They have then revised their schedules, and again allocated no time whatsoever to deal with further trouble. And of course there was further trouble.
This is incredibly dishonest on their part.
@_date: 2013-10-11 11:54:19
If you start following the transactions, you will see far larger sums. Also, getting them laundered through Just-dice.com, apparently.

Except if someone actually *wants* to destroy the network, and has the resources to do it. They can just build a large batch of mining chips and fire them up.
@_date: 2013-10-12 15:28:38
Try clicking on the chain of largest transfers from that for a while and you'll find it pretty quick, several times.
