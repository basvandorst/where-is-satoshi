There's nothing on Uber's website that suggests that they are. I'm not sure where else one would go to find verification of this assertion. Maybe the suggestion is in the same vein as everyone crying out for someone to save their souls. 
Ubet isn't "Crying out" for anything right now. You might be of the opinion that their business model would fit nicely with a cryptocurrency, I might even share that opinion. But then, most businesses I know of would find benefit in implementing some support for it. Uber isn't special here.
The article you linked to has nothing whatsoever to do with Bitcoin...
All that said, the eventual idea is to get to a point where we define "market cap" in terms of bitcoins rather than dollars. There's a lot of work to be done before we can do that.

Theoretically, you could have 21 ~~billion~~ million coins in a single address. But you couldn't really have more than that, because there will never, ever be any more mined.

Single-issue voters. Bitcoin is basically the only thing (they think) they know, so Rand Paul's position on bitcoin is the only thing relevant to them.

I don't think Warren Buffett was intending any offense. Or anyone who isn't currently involved with or using bitcoin right now.

Figures. I've always been more than a bit skeptical of physical bitcoins' practical use, even as a long-term cold-storage method, anyway. 
There's the novelty factor, perhaps; just not practical or secure.

Bitcoin won't protect the poor, any more than the dollar has, or the yen, or the yuan, or the pound, euro, or the silver sheckel. Honestly, it's either laughably stupid or horribly dishonest to take this position.
"protecting the poor" isn't about distribution of currency, it's about distribution of medicine, education, law enforcement, housing, water, food, all that stuff. 
Be evangelical about bitcoins if you like. But please, don't pretend it's some magical fix to the woes of society. These problems existed when people used precious metals (the most immediate example of deflationary currency I could come up with), and they will continue to exist.
Honestly, I'd rather talk to a jerk that says "fuck the poor." At least I'm not being lied to.

Thanks for your feedback!
Yeah, the odds of any one cast lot winning is very, very low. The number of entries and the size of the blocks are the two biggest factors in that.
The current average transactions per block right now is just shy of 340. Every once in a while a small block, or even a single-transaction block, shows up in the blockchain. So, every once in a while, a player entry has a high probability of winning. Admittedly not very often, though.
I tested the code against a satoshidice address, and started scanning a few hundred blocks back. Using that address, I found that an input transaction won every 5th or 6th block, prizes were anywhere from .1 BTC to 5 BTC.
I don't smoke anywhere near enough crack to be under the assumption I'd get that kind of traffic, though. 
Generally, it was just a project to become more familiar with making code to respond to bitcoin transactions. I wanted to avoid the super-simple satoshidice model. It's a very popular game, but I don't know that I'd learn much by writing a clone. Essentially, it rolls a number one time for every transaction paying into a given address.
Over the next week, I have plans to put something else together, too.
What kind of game would you play?
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:12:37
This is a conversation, not just a simple explanation.
It won't save the paper the wallet is printed from being used as toilet paper if the recipient doesn't buy into the bitcoin group-think the same way most of us still buy into our local fiat group-think.
Changing someone's world-view enough to make that change can be hard.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:01:21
It's a nice thought, maybe, but it's not worth doing. 95% of your BTC tip keys will go into the trash, alongside all the other 'evangelical' trinkets that about 1% of people replace a tip with. Actually probably a bit more.
It's equal to burning money to watch the flames. If I were to do something like this (I don't have enough bitcoins to do much just yet), I'd really want to have a way to recover coins not redeemed.
You COULD keep the private keys so you could recover unspent coins, but there's potential issues with that. The majority of new people are unfamiliar with how wallets work, and might not empty it upon receipt. Six months later, it still has a balance of .01 BTC, you assume it's trashed and empty it. Six months and one day, they notice a transaction that they did not make. I'd want a different solution. And... I just thought of one. I'll start work on that tonight...
Aside from that, there's the impression being made. If I get a stupid trinket instead of cash, it's worse than being stiffed. The guy I drove across town to deliver food to not only didn't tip me, he's mocking me as well. 
Obviously, you're not wanting to be that guy, otherwise you wouldn't be making this post. If you do this, do this in addition to a normal tip, trinkets in addition to a tip are actually really appreciated.
For me, personally, I think it's a great idea. I rely on tips from my day job (I hate my day job), and it'd be awesome to have someone offer to tip me in bitcoins. But that's just me, personally. I am the only person I know personally that has any interest in bitcoins right now.
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:36:19
Nope. Not yet, anyway. So long as trading bitcoin for whatever local currency is most commonly used remains a necessary step, it won't be.
Eventually, as more vendors, merchants, and workers warm to the idea of being compensated in bitcoin, then it will make more sense.
Focusing on bitcoin-based charity kind of tugs at the warm-fuzzy heart strings. It hits the "aww" button that cute-fuzzy-kitten pictures hit. It's all marketing.

Bitcoin will remain volatile until most users of the currency is customers and merchants.
Right now, most people just don't think of bitcoin as money, not even the vendors that DO accept bitcoin as payment. The can of soda pop on my desk here was $2, which is around .008 BTC.
When folks start thinking of a can of soda as .004 BTC or a car as 40.0 BTC or a house at 243.00 BTC, then prices will slow it's growth, and be less liable to crash.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:47:46
So, you want to replace the government scheme with a different one? BEFORE there's infrastructure for it?
Honestly, for this context, drop the issue of bitcoin vs fiat, government vs anarchy, political motivations, all that crap, it's not valuable to the discussion.
Your boss's motivation is about saving money. He's spending 1k in USD today so he can pay out 2k USD worth in bitcoin later. I'm not saying that's wrong, it's actually a pretty smart way to look at it.
I'm just saying there's lots of potential for all sorts of dick moves, even if unintended.

@_date: 2013-12-05 02:19:10
Not a bad idea. Buy a bunch of bitcoin now, use the bitcoin to pay wages as the currency gains value. Net effect is that you pay less in payroll.
You could even sell the idea to the employees as an added benefit. The currency is almost surely going to continue appreciating as time goes by. The amount that'll buy a gallon of gas today could well buy a tank in a few weeks, maybe with the car attached even. That's a HELL of a deal. I would very likely seriously consider it.
It sounds, though, like "bitcoin or hit the road" is the aim of this approach. I'm not going to say it's wrong, but it might be a dick move depending on the local economy. Would your employees be able to find a local merchant willing to sell gasoline for bitcoin? Could bread or milk be gotten for bitcoin? Can they pay their rent with bitcoin? Can utilities bills be paid with bitcoin? If "no" or "only at the farmers' market" is the answer, then this decision would be quite the dick move, indeed.
Aside from that, there's the issue of education. It's really, really easy to be very evangelical about something and only partially inform people about that thing as a result. If you're the first these employees have heard of bitcoin, then you've likely failed to give them complete and accurate information regarding the currency. One might forget to mention the potential challenge in converting cryptocurrency into local fluid currency, Which would be a dick move.
I'm not saying your boss is wrong to be so heavily vested in the currency, or that his desire to 'bring others into the fold' is wrong, or insisting that his employees take bitcoin as payment is wrong. I'm only saying there's great potential for dick moves on this path.
If you're unconcerned about dick moves (I've had plenty of bosses that were, and there's never going to be iron-clad laws against being a dick) go for it. 
Personally, I'd suggest giving the employees a choice. Include the option of partial payment in bitcoin.
In any case, talk to a lawyer before making this decision. Even if there's precedent in New York, Utah might have other rules.  (reddit is not a lawyer, neither am I).

Yes, and if you have funds you want to be able to keep safe, you should do it.
Personally, if/when I get enough coins to have a 'savings account', I plan on having three wallets for personal use. One on computer (debit-card style account), one on a bootable drive (short-term savings account), and a paper wallet. 
You should also be sure to back up the wallet you have on your computer, as well.

If bitcoin were to become a dominant, daily life currency... that's an interesting idea. I know it's the 'goal,' but it just doesn't feel real yet. I guess I hadn't really thought about how it'd effect education services. Or public roads. Or government in general.
Using bitcoin requires an infrastructure, so I don't think that bitcoin is going to cause the fall of society and rule of law. An anarchy would likely fail to keep up services like electricity.
It's also not something that contributes to a more liberal set of rules, either. 
A change of currency isn't going to change how people define the function of government.
No one pays taxes willingly. Not one person. Some people just bitch about it more. Down with taxes! (until I need a cop!)
Bitcoin has the potential to change how it's done, though. I imagine that income taxes would likely go away, at least for a while, due to the complex and relatively new challenge of tracing bitcoin transactions. Sales taxes may go away, too... 
Taxes will be based more upon physical things than currency. Your property and land taxes will be higher, cars will cost more to get registered. Federal taxes will be levied on top of local and state tax bills.

The one concern I have about giving paper wallets as gifts is the likelihood of someone having no clue what it is, using it as a coaster, and eventually trashing it as one of more-than-a-few gag gifts that are too uninteresting to keep.
Might put an "expiration date" on it, so you can recover any coin they didn't remember to pick up.
@_date: 2013-07-22 21:44:05
What's the point? 
I mean, I know that, eventually, for lots of folks interested in bitcoin, it's really kinda the goal. Y'know, go out with a few microbitcoins on your phone's wallet, and have an awesome night on the town. Send coin to a few addresses owned by the utility companies, bills paid. Scan a QR code at the convenience store, get a candy bar.
Currently, though, outside of a very few localities, it's just not possible. Myself, I wouldn't be able to pay rent, any of my bills, buy groceries, or anything else with bitcoins.
Good luck to them, I suppose, they'll probably make good memories with this. 
I think a better approach to the issue of liquidity would be aiming at merchants.
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:16:49
