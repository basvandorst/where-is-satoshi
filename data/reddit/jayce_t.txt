Yeah, but I want to make full use of its power
@_date: 2019-07-01 05:28:44
That is the idea, yes. I plan to use this node to transact, the point of this post was just to try be happy in that I'm taking a further step in helping grow the community and maybe be happy with that progress
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:52:47
No I don't, not on this machine. I don't have enough use for Linux at the current moment. When I begin learning further coding skills I'll be using a Linux laptop, however

Finally my doge maximalist portfolio with pay off!

@_date: 2019-07-01 04:42:25
Then why not tell me how to fix that instead of being a jackass?

About 4 days in total

Having another copy of the blockchain to verify
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:29:39
Once I can code worth a damn I definitely will
@_date: 2019-07-01 05:49:11
Yeah but I didn't want to prune it. Rather I wanted to run a full node
@_date: 2019-07-01 10:45:43
Not at home right now, but I can take one when I get home
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:04:36
Open port 8333 and it can be connected to by the Bitcoin network
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:29:27
Fuck you, let me have the victory and quit being a supremacist. It's not like I'm running a full linux distro without the actual skill to make full use of all of it.
@_date: 2019-07-01 04:42:49
Just opened it up on my router. It's a weird one so it took a bit to get the damn connection working
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:50:59
Roughly 225gb. You're best to prune it for a Pi or use an external HDD to hold it
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:51:35
So far about 2.5gb outbound. I'm on an unlimited fibre optic plan so it's working pretty well.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:15:07
I don't cash out. I just hold and spend BTC straight where I can
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:45:48
The idea of the node is be exposed so it can be used by others. Do you even know how this works?
@_date: 2019-07-01 04:52:43
Sweet, I'm restarting Core currently and hopefully the connections will increase. I've looked at running it over tor in the future, but for now I' happy to just be part of the network supporting BTC :)
@_date: 2019-07-01 04:44:40
Thanks dude, Just got the port opened up
@_date: 2019-07-01 10:09:04
Its open now. When i finished setting it all up I'd yet to configure that
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:46:55
Thanks! That's the first tip I've ever recieved
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:53:20
You assume I dont
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:48:10
If you read the comments you'd see that when I screenshotted this the port forwarding wasn't set up. Now that it is I'm matching your node.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:20:51
Oh sweet summer child...
@_date: 2019-07-01 08:05:45
Yeah you can run it on any OS, and you don't get fees unless you're mining
@_date: 2019-07-01 10:18:13
Hopefully in the future I'll have a Pi set up with a Lightning node on it. And might see about investing in an ASIC miner, although the cost seems not worth it to me. Looking forward to the future!
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:45:26
Yeah, he already had a wallet and had been investing in BTC for a few months by that point.
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:23:32
I made my first purchase with BTC today! Purchased a used car for 0.165btc after my last one died a horrible, sputtering death at the hands of a cracked radiator. Super reliable little thing that the seller was wanting 3K for, in really good condition too and not much mileage. 
I didn't have the spare liquidity to buy it at the time, but asked offhand "would you take bitcoin?". And he did! I had a nice investment which had grown over 300% since the beginning and I used 0.165 BTC to seal the deal on that car.
No tax, no fees (save the small transaction fee), and transparent payment between us.
Even though I HODL like hell it felt really good to actually use Bitcoin as a means of currency, and use what I earned from my investment for something I needed.
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:23:39
I started running a full node a few months ago
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:32:22
You've never heard of diversifying investments?
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:03:06
When the bottom falls out, I'm just gonna go all out buying
@_date: 2019-06-12 11:41:44
Did you despite it or try get an explanation? That's something you should really appeal as the lecturer gave no explanation or justification on their mark.
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:12:07
I think he's crying because he's realizing how close he is to losing and being inundated with legal fees and having zero credibility (publicly) after the decision.
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:41:46
Ledger Nano S has worked brilliant for me. That being said I haven't used the Trezor at all.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:52:46
Better than getting in at 20k
@_date: 2019-12-24 01:01:15
Get a load of this guy...
