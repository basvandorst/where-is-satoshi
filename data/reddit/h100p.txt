Don't you remember the huge price difference between Gox and other exchanges? It was sometimes &gt; 20%. That was also the case in the Bull run to $1200. At that moment there was a huge discrepancy.... At that period there were withdrawal issues. Bitcointalk.org has lots of thread about that subject..... Also Bitcoin Magazine has a chapter on it.

So the Bitcoin price went down, even when 3700 to 3200 BTC are lost? Smells like Price manipulation without posses even the real coins! This is not unusual in the gold and silver futures market

All, the so called experts say, the price per btc does not matter. Its how many ppl make use of it. May I conclude that the price is independent of how many ppl use btc. Why? Because a lot more ppl use btc  now in compare to the period when btc in the 1000s). So it does not hurt when price per btc is like $1.5 per btc ? Is there no danger of someone buy the whole stack? So price DOES matter after all?

Okay. Then its less severe. Only the Huobi users are the victims, not the rest of the market....
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:27:29
In my opinion Bitcoin does not need an ETF. 
An ETF must be audited by people. And people can not be trust.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:28:22
Would be very foolish do that that with something that month after month losing value. Bitcoin had its time. There are currently 14M bitcoins in circulation. Someone needs only $140k to buy all the coins at $0.01. When that happens all you can do is wait before new coins are mined (max 21M). 
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:07:27
The main problem is there are not much "normal" people that use a cryptocurrency. Besides me I do not know anyone who sees potential in crypto currentcies. At $7 they laughed at me, at $1200 they still laughed at me. And of course now they still laugh at me ("look at that decline!"). They see it as programmers and nerd money. I personally will  never swap it back at fiat money, even it is one Satoshi (again)
@_date: 2014-09-21 16:15:42
Yep. This also applies to Bitcoin itself....

I hope not, but i'm afraid it is :-)

@_date: 2014-10-26 09:50:23
Lets hope you're right.
@_date: 2014-11-02 11:58:09
With more and more bitcoin derivatives including the coming ETF this will become harder and harder. Especially when the majority of "new" people pick up these instruments (because of the leverage) instead of real coins. Sad.

I agree it does not matter to them. But for the customer who sees the prices increase in Bitcoin it has a negative psychological effect. And that effect is the one the sales department of Dell wants to avoid....
@_date: 2014-12-29 10:57:59
Bitcoin is likely to stay, just as TCP/IP. But like TC/IP the value will be in the pennies. We certainly do not pay hundreds of dollars for accumulating TCP/IP. We use it. That will also be the case for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-14 09:08:29
The technology of bitcoin will be adopted by banks by their 'own' blockchain. Under their control. That will be the start of a mass adoption of their virtual currencies but not bitcoin (the biggest part of regular people trust banks and governments a lot). What we're now withness at the price of bitcoin is a slow dead towards zero
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:59:57
Wonder at what price Dell and others decide to quit support for Bitcoin. Their prices in Bitcoin has since they start with it increased with 70% (bitcoin has collapsed that much since they began)
@_date: 2014-10-26 09:18:52
Sounds nice. But buying ETFs does not directly effect the real price of BTC... They can claim their ETF represents some quantity of Bitcoins, but this is a matter of trust. Bitcoin in your own (paper) wallet itself is only trustworthy. Especially if its for your retirement

They can manipulate gold down with derivatives (corrected spelling). Eventually this will be also the case for bitcoin. 
Deviates are the mother of all fuckups. The final weapon of the banks for who cross them
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:23:53
Or those that has to pay the bills in fiat. I suspect a great deal of the decline is caused by the miners who has to pay the electricity bills in fiat. When revenue was relative big, only a small part of the coins had to be used to pay the mining costs... Again speculation....
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:24:25
I agree again.... But Bitcoin price set off exchanges .... Only place to trade bitcoin then is at local markets?

You are right. Unfortunately you can conclude that most of the people ignore this fact and keep the rigged mess alive. So thats what I also told when I heard the first time that there were derivatives in trading bitcoin years ago. The only conclusion is: They win. Bitcoin flat on that ground near zero in a couple of years
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:17:17
That's exact the reason why the Chinese never fully close their exchanges. Only on this way they can control the price of bitcoin, and keep the people poor.
@_date: 2014-04-27 09:35:41

How can you be sure that the bitcoins are really available when shorted? In the fiat derivatives world there are lots of 'naked' contracts which the asset even not exist (anymore). In that environment it is possible to pressure the price down. The CFTC look away, because it is in their interest that that asset keeps down. Yes I'm talking about the gold and silver short contracts. This is also possible with Bitcoin? [Questionmark] 
@_date: 2014-12-29 16:28:23
This year have more people bought and used bitcoin compared to the time bitcoin was growing over $1000. So the 'supply' thing does not help to increase value for Bitcoin.

"NO" Leading in Polls - Swiss Vote Referendum Derails Gold - UPDATED
I will get more on this later as time permits...
The polls seem to have shifted AGAINST the referendum. That has pulled the rug out from under the gold market which has been drawing support from recent polls showing "YES" had a slight lead.
I believe that once the public realizes that the SWB will be at a serious disadvantage in maintaining the Swiss Franc/Euro peg if the referendum passes, the mood will shift against it. 
Quick note - gold has lost $1180 once again. That is a big deal. It needs to stay above that level to keep the bullish hopes alive.
38% YES
47% NO

Printing or not. Bitcoin loses value for the past 8 months. In this rate its value nears zero at a given time.
