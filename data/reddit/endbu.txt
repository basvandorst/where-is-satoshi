Have you considered adding a bitcoin icon next to the other payment options at the bottom of the page?

I't not a fan of that logic. 
Anyone who is capable of breaking an entry into my house, and stealing my coffee, does not deserve my coffee. Don't care if they did it all while juggling and on a uni-cycle. It's still my coffee. 
I think what you MEANT was, someone intelligent and resourceful enough to get away with a $5 dollar coffee heist, would probably find  more profit just working a technical job, or selling things online, or investing... ect.

@_date: 2014-03-19 14:13:31
I've asked this question before. 
The technology seems matched. 
* Reason 1: Bitcoin came first and has dominated publicity in the crypto currency media. Because of this, I believe Bitcoin will also attract the greater share of institutions necessary for developing the infrastructure. 
* Reason 2: The community is "better." Reddit is only a subset. For the record, I believe is self-absorbed, biased, and closed minded at best. However, they demonstrate significantly more maturity than the dogecoin sub. 
* Reason 3: The primary argument for many alt-coins seems to be "We've already missed the Bitcoin-boat, but there is still time to jump on the dogecoin-boat!" This is false. Crypto currency penetration is only a tiny fraction of 1%. We can not expect mass adoption until we break the "tipping point" of ~15.8% which represents the total population up to 1 sigma away from the 50% mark. It’s science. Therefore, the Bitcoin boat has not left yet. The current user base would need to grow so many times over to reach that tipping point level, which only then will explode into mass adoption. We’ll shoot past the moon if that happens. 
* Reason 4: Similar to Reason 2: The people I have spoken to in person whom believe in Bitcoin are intelligent, professional, and financially successful (without bitcoin). This leads me to feel that my decisions are verified. Herd mentality.

Holy shit. What a great visualization. 
On a side note, dyson spheres are a really cool concept. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:49:23
This has happened to me twice. 
It goes something like this:
* LBC seller test my address with $1
* Transaction works quick.
* I hand over cash
* Seller sends full BTC
* We both sit there for over an hour waiting. 
* I eventually let him go on with his life after taking images of his license, his Social security card, a sample of blood, his first born child. 
The end. 
I wonder if it's related to the first transaction only getting a couple of confirmations. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:07:14
Whooh, careful with that blanket statement. What if only serial killers or New York Jets fans started endorsing BTC. Wouldn't look good for the rest of us.

This point is debatable. I believe the Reddit community tends to lean heavily towards socialism. 
However I'll stir the pot since you seem like you're willing to think and talk.
Consider these ideas from Sam Stone:




@_date: 2014-09-18 13:15:00
This is the answer I expected. 
OP's question is similar to asking: "At what speed will I lose the race?"
Unfortunately, that's dependent on other variables.

I had to pause after that same sentence. OP could be a master troll. Nothing guarantees a response more than saying something "incorrect." 
Its my opinion that OP is off his horse. However, he could be right.

You're correct. Gold is a poor investment. However, historically it has been an ~~excellent~~ the best store of value. 
The thought example you mentioned can also be said about dollars or bitcoin. A nice thing about stores of value (unlike farmland) is they don't require any maintenance. 
You got me on the fondling though. Farmland is better for that I think.

A weak article not strongly tied back to bitcoin. Bitcoin is mentioned in 3 paragraphs including the into and conclusion.

Liquidity is a necessary component to money and a healthy economy. Ideally traders are doing us a service of mitigating price swing by anticipating supply and demand. If the toilet paper factory gets hit with a meteorite, speculators need to bid up the price asap to encourage consumer moderation. Same economic laws apply to currencies. 
**TL;DR** why you mad brah

That is the beauty of technology. Technology enables society to move forward and improve everyone's standard of life.
