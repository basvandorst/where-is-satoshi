On the Robinhood podcast the other day they called this the “chair” because of the shape on the trading chart ��

I wouldn’t have even posted this on my main account OP, don’t put a target on yourself. Stay secure and I hope you have 2 factor authentication on all your sensitive accounts ��
I’ll see you at the moon ��

Totally irrelevant but the signature on this art image looks similar to Michael Jackson’s signature

Can you give us a version without the signature? Makes it look less clean

A single Bitcoin would literally change my life ��
But no I wouldn’t spend all $8K on BTC.
I would spend $3K completely wiping out the remainder of my debts, then I would put aside $2K into a safety cushion in case of an emergency, I would invest $2K into a Vanguard index fund to help with retirement down the line, the remaining $1K I would invest into bitcoin ��

$40M per pizza �� makes that easily the largest sum (realized much later of course) ever spent on Pizza. Imagine if the delivery was late or something and the pizza had been free ��

I made my first “IRL” exchange recently at a Coinstar machine at a grocery store by my house, fee was only 4% of the transaction value no matter the amount.

Who would win, the open source Bitcoin code and public global decentralized blockchain vs. old white men in suits? 
I like Bitcoin because no one can take my money �� my bank cant ‘freeze’ my money because there’s an issue, it can’t physically be stolen from my house or leather wallet. My country (USA) can’t print a bunch of Bitcoin and lower the value of it to pay debts for example. I can send Bitcoin to my friends in other countries in seconds for a tiny tiny fee, even smaller fees with other forms of crypto that are emerging. 
When thinking about Bitcoin, remember that at the older generations of people phase out, young people are still very strongly believing Bitcoin and the opportunity and fairness it brings. Faster, safer, decentralized benefits are true competitors to the slow and broken financial systems that rule the world today. In my eyes this is just fair competition. Let the global market decide which is better and let’s go with that. It’s going to suck for those in power today who benefit from the antiquated system but that’s the natural progression of things.
The federal reserve IS losing power and that might not be a bad thing, maybe it’s time the world collectively controls the currency globally with Bitcoin rather than putting our trust into the federal reserve in the U.S. 
Money belongs to everyone ��

I typically use Coinbase but I thought I would purchase Bitcoin last month just to test an IRL way of buying them in-person just for funsies. I put $50 in the machine and got $48 of Bitcoin but that was right when Bitcoin was at $6K each, so considering the timing and that its shot up to $8K right now I’m not too worried about the $2 fee ��

I’ve been laughing as everyone panics and I just don’t touch my Bitcoin. I don’t panic sell, I don’t panic buy, just watch the madness and do nothing. Just like the stock market you shouldn’t get personal with it or freak out.

By it's very nature it is impossible to stop people who really want to use Bitcoin. It is decentralized, it is protected from people just like this for this exact reason. Just like the war on encryption, it is an idea. It is a Pandora's box that was already opened. The source code is public, can be read/viewed/used by anyone anytime anywhere in the world. If you're scared about them 'banning' crypto, you can always just put it on a paper wallet and put it in cold storage and be fine. They cannot ban pieces of paper!

Just like with the stock market, the best position is always to invest what you’re willing to risk and hold (in bitcoin terms ‘HODL’) and literally forget about it for a few years. 
If you check your balance every 5 minutes you’re going to have feelings of excitement, dread, guilt, regret, and then more excitement as it goes up and down in the short term. 
Price of BTC is speculative but if you hang on for the long term you’re better off ��
If you do check your balance one day and it’s down, even quite a bit, don’t sell. Just HODL. We’re in this for the long term prospects and widespread adoption of BTC.

I’m too lazy to find the video but a guy asked people if they wanted like a 10 oz bar of pure silver or a Hershey’s chocolate bar and like 99.9% of people took the Hershey’s because it’s chocolate and you can eat chocolate. Wasn’t til the very end of the video someone took the silver bar. This is the society we live in.

Coinstar machines at some locations sell BTC for physical cash (not coins but only paper dollars) but it’s through CoinMe.com and you have to be 18+ with valid ID and selfies but just have a friend do it and have them send the Bitcoin to you when they have full control of the BTC. Maybe pay a friend $5 for their time and assistance. The machine charges 4% fee

I don’t think of myself as someone more intelligent than the average Joe but as someone who works in retail among common everyday people I see some incredibly head scratching moments at times that makes me wonder how some people have gotten as far as they have in life.

In like 5 to 10 years we're going to hear stories about people buying old computers/laptops at Goodwill and finding millions of dollars $ worth of Bitcoin private keys laying in a notepad file on the desktop.

I don’t have any BTC yet so I really appreciate this:
