Lost in his personal wallet?

No because they worked to build the company. The creator of bitcoin doesn't own it and never did. He simply designed a system that allowed early adopters to benefit greatly.

How is that a ponzi scheme? If anything BitCoin is because the creator owns like 5% of the Bitcoins and he has made so much money.

The vitcoin market is even easier to manipulate. They could make a good amount of money doing so.

Which is?

Hardly a Ponzi Scheme. It's more stable and reliable than the entirety of Bitcoin and I have money in bitcoin.

Same thing would have happened if the regulations allowed Gox.

Yes but the ones that caused Gox to go to Japan are great. If they were not there, the same thing would have happened but worse on a much larger scale in the Stock market and banks. Face the facts that Gox was shady as shit and the regulations were trying to protect you but instead they move to another nation and you still kept sending them money even though they were shady as shit and didn't meet any of the requirements to be a legit business.

True but none of the blame is on the US government.

? Pentagon can account for it. It is the DoD budget since 1996. Also the last time they were audited.

I love SC and wish it was the biggest e Sport but it is definitely second place next to Dota and LoL. I think SC has the most dedicated fan base but that is just m opinion.

Goldwin's Law in effect.

Its not the Pentagon's fault they haven't been audited.

Like the law of Bitcoin too.
