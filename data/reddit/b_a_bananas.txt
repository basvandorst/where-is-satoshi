No they don't. The defining characteristic of a bubble is that you can't know whether you're in one. That's how they happen. 
Winston Churchill had a pertinent quote: "In finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is disagreeable."

I can say this because every time a bubble breaks, we talk about it after the fact as if we saw it coming. If you want to get the same returns as everyone else, you make same investments as everyone else. 
As far as analysis goes - Different people can reach completely different conclusions from the same dataset. If this kind of analysis offered actual _proof_ about valuation, I think the price would have already stabilized. 
If I could prove it to you I would, but that would mean there's no longer an investment opportunity. Consider that 1) cryptocurrency solves a practical problem, so it's certainly not worthless, and 2.) if you look at cryptocurrency compared to other asset classes, which have aggregate valuations in the trillions of dollars, then Bitcoin still looks like it has a relatively low valuation.

There is no precedent for this exact situation. My line of reasoning is based on valuation relative to other asset classes. 
At today's prices, the Bitcoin market cap is ~$180 billion. Large cap stocks have market caps on this order of magnitude. No stock has a market cap in the trillion dollar range. 
However, the total value of asset classes easily reach into the trillions of dollars. All of the gold ever mined on is with ~$7 trillion. Real estate in the US, IIRC is worth something between $15 and $30 trillion ( you can google this). 
So with cryptocurrency, you have an asset class that solves a practical problem and still has an aggregate value that's tiny compared to other asset classes.  I fail to see how this indicates Bitcoin being overvalued. If anything, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general both have a ton of room to keep growing.

I've been thinking about this too. Just the introduction of futures trading will spur demand and the potential for hugely dramatic spikes if there's a short squeeze at some point. It's gonna be nuts. 
No matter the outcome, there are going to be case studies written about this time period.

Lol I know, and I'm not trolling, I just have a million other things I'm trying to figure out in the rest of my life.

Remember that investing is hard work and sometimes you have to hold fast.

Ok, I have to chime in here. That interview is when I realized I'll never look at Jon Stewart as anything but a pandering blowhard. 
Cramer was wrong, just like the rest of the profession, and that should have been expected. 
Jon Stewart can dish it out liberally but hides behind the innocuous excuse of  "I'm just a comedian" anytime he faces criticism. If he wants to do that, he should quit acting like America's stepdad anytime he takes part in a "serious" interview.

It's not the choice you made, but the quality of the choice itself. Cheers!

If it brings a significant amount new investment, it's not priced in. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:22:32
This is exactly the thing. If you're looking at the price of an individual unit, you have no context. If you consider the aggregate value, as an asset class, the current valuation of under a trillion is actually quite small.

The economics profession is notorious for infighting. Actually, this makes for an ironic parallel to the cryptocurrency community. 
Economics education is focused on building well-reasoned arguments to inform policy/decision-making. When this is done well, these arguments become accepted as part of the Economics canon.  However, formal arguments are typically sensitive to any deviations from their underlying premises.  
Usually we don't have all of the data to really "know" how a market will act in the future, so we have to make assumptions. Inevitably, people make different initial assumptions and end up with completely distant conclusions. 
On top of that, an actively trading market attracts new participants with a variety of opinions over time. And while economists are concerned with "knowing" things, prudent investors will try to use more agnostic strategies that mean they can afford to be wrong.

Can you point to any documentation for this, especially with respect to paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:59:34
Like everyone else 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:14:53
The vast majority of the profession was wrong at that time

Asset class valuations are much greater than money supplies anyways.

MS in Econ here, I believe Bitcoin has a lot of room to grow ��

The job of an economist is to imagine alternative states of the world. Other people's worldviews are likely cluttered with incidental facts from reality. 
It's shocking how prescient this clip is.

The discussions about fiat and monetary policy are mostly irrelevant. 
The key benefit of cryptocurrencies that they are a medium of exchange that eliminates traditional 3rd-party middle-men. That's it. 
If you want to want to think about valuation, a more useful analogy is to consider other mediums of exchange - For example, how would one have speculated on radio spectrum licenses in the early 20th century? The value of these assets would go up as radio proliferated, but it's not necessarily true that the majority of users would be license owners.

I have a lot of respect for this guy but crypto is so volatile, how can he convincingly argue this point? My read on the situation is that there is a large amount of investment that just hasn't made it's way into crypto yet - at least an order of magnitude beyond the current market cap - so as soon as some crypto-based ETFs are approved by the SEC, or crypto-based apps become available to mainstream users, this demand will be realized and prices will take off.
