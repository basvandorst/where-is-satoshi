Got it, thanks for explaining that. Still huge news.

I am still lost why anyone would do this? I own both a Nexus 5 and an iPhone 5. Both phones are great IMO. If you really wanted an Nexus 5 instead of your iPhone5, you could SELL your iPhone5 for about $400 and still have money left over for a case.

So, where is the link to their prices? I can't seem to find it.

Can't pass up this deal; Great timing also!

Alright, I get the sending the message part but it seems silly IMO. This doesn't affect their sales on already purchased iPhones. We would need to steer people away from buying NEW iPhones,  I would think.

The cheating in the game is so high. The game always goes on sale and you can expect a wave of cheaters with fresh accounts. Awesome game but the cheating needs to be addressed much better.
