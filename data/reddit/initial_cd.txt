Update: Okay I have a new HDD its only a week old, I'm hoping its not secretly a brick pretending to be a hard-drive... I know that bitcoin-qt code is buggy, well, i've HEARD that anyways....
I will attempt to re-download and sync when I get back.... 
I'm posting this because I googled the hell out of this issue and got a little worried after not being able to get any hits.

THIS! ^
I have just spent about 3 hours trying to find the answer to this.... my google-fu is weak.
So, say if I have 999 trillion offline PC's and install wallets on all of them, the chances of generating 2 duplicate private keys is.... nothing to be concerned about....? Does anyone know exactly what the odds are? Or are they just so high it would be fruitless to even attempt to calculate?
I just couldn't get my head around how a completely offline PC can generate a private key and NOT have duplicates at some point in the future....
I think i meant public keys, not private....

I only have 1 profile... trash is empty, as it was last night. It WAS encrypted, thankfully... I'm behind a router and firewalls... fresh install of windows via the new HDD I got last week...

I just got out of VoS and made an account with Cavirtex. (  
Got verified within a day and got my bank account linked after 3 days, was actually slightly easier than getting verified with VoS. 
The fees are higher at Cavirtex and you wont be able to withdraw anything for the first 14 days, so keep that in mind.   
Definitely check out  as well, but I'm not familiar with that exchange.

There's a lot more than 10 countries on that list.  
I am saying they are not the leaders and the gap is significant.

Not really...  
  
According to the Index, the freest nations in the world are, in order: Hong Kong, Switzerland, Finland, Denmark, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Ireland, United Kingdom and Sweden. The United States is the only English-speaking country to rank outside the top 10.
