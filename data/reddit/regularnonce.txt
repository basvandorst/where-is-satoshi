Lol, the only thing that changed is that less people use bitcoin. 
The number of transaction outputs is falling and currently below the number of outputs during most of 2017.

I am talking about the number of transaction outputs which is currently at 4000. (you need to click on "outputs")
This is way below the average of the whole of 2017.

It is funny because the amount of batching is currently decreasing. The number of outputs is going down with approximately constant blocksize.
A lot of lies are being spread that low fees are a result of increased batching.

Well, spreading lies does not help either. The number of transaction outputs is going down as well:

The number of outputs is even lower than most of 2017. But go ahead and downvote my post. Or ban me if that does not help.

Well, if the blocksize stays roughly constant and transaction outputs are going down it means that batching is currently decreasing.
Unfortunately people here don't want to hear that. So they make their own reality.

Thank you, I do not need to be protected from facts.

In other words, you want to manipulate the market by making people sell. Awesome.
And now go back to wallstreetbets.

Blocksize has been more less constantly the maximum size of ~1 MB since beginning of 2017.
In the last weeks blocksize went a bit below the max. But only ~50 kB on average.

One of my posts about this has even been removed. I guess you can call it intentional misinformation.
