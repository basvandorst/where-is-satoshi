Let's be completely honest here: you got schooled.
Bruce went for the throat, and deftly identified your comical inconsistency of thought. He never resorted to any logical fallacies like strawmen and didn't have to use sarcasm - he just used logic.
You, unable to *actually support your stance*, have basically flailed around at the end here and ultimately you've made a fool of yourself. You can't sidestep your way out of this one; he got you. 
Either man up and defend/qualify your stance, or admit defeat. As it is right now, you're a coward, and a coward who just obviously lost an argument, too.

1 hour versus months. Nope, wrong there.


Tens of thousands of self-interested agents forming temporary coalitions of mining pools... versus one Federal Reserve beholden to no one but themselves. Bitcoin is better on that front too.


What does this mean? Do you mean "low adoption rate"? Wouldn't this be an argument in favor of "potential for growth"?

Yes, because Krugman's ["analysis"]( with regards to Bitcoin was really in-depth and intelligent. He really eloquently and thoroughly explained the technical limitations of Bitcoin, and why exactly it won't work...

Whether deflation is bad is entirely irrelevant to whether Bitcoin will continue to function as designed, and will continue growing in adoption as it has done for the past 6 years.

No, he means "the Internet" because that's what the public generally referred to the Web as. "The web" was actually initially referred to as "the world wide web" and the phrase was said about as frequently as "the information superhighway" was. It was **much, much, much** more common for people to just refer to the Web as "the Internet" and it was **very much** thought of as a tech-geek thing, and not the revolutionary technology that it truly is.
Most Buttcoiners love to pretend that everyone recognized that the Internet was a brilliant innovation and that the world was fully aware of its transformative capabilities in the early 90s... but the general public really was not convinced of its potential.

...which should mean that the "default" algorithmic parameters have more influence on the aggregate psychology of the market, no?
If more people are watching the 1W MACD, no matter whether that timespan is arbitrary or not, it should lend the 1W MACD relative significance.

There's no *necessity* to do so. The only **benefit** that a blockchain provides is distribution of consensus, however. Using a blockchain to "log my personal emails on my PC, and be able to tell if the hard drive messed up, or someone tried to plant a fake email to make me look like a criminal" would be simply using a very expensive and pointless checksum. 
The only benefit a blockchain provides is distributed consensus. If a decentralized network is not the goal, you can do things much cheaper and much more efficiently than a blockchain, using cryptography outside of Bitcoin.
I think it's pretty funny that you just spent your time typing up a comment on something you fundamentally do not understand. There is literally *no* advantage to a blockchain, other than decentralization.


Nice strawman. I can absolutely see the use of a blockchain for a non-financial purpose such as Namecoin, where **decentralization is the aim**.

Did you not see the 3 other people who made the same joke before you, or did you see them and decide to repeat the same joke anyway?
Either way, I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul.

Did I upset the poor little troll? Oops!
I've noticed that facts and direct quotes are anathema to trolls/Buttcoiners like yourself. Best of luck in your future trolls!

Math doesn't appear to be your strong suit. What you just said is not even close to right. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:19:32
Now you're trying to change the subject. We're talking about a *blockchain*, numbnuts. Not hashes or checksums in general.
Fucking lol. You must have already realized you lost this, otherwise why would you be so desperately trying to reposition the goalposts?
You're welcome for showing you how stupid you are.

Wouldn't the "centrally controlled" clause be the entire reason no one can agree on a particular asset standard? Country X wouldn't want to jump on Country Y's currency standard, because doing so relinquishes to Country Y power that Country X might otherwise enjoy.
When you add in the "non-centrally controlled" clause to the protocol, it means that using said protocol is "fair" to both Countries X and Y - obviously, if either country could persuade the other(s) to use its own standard, it would be ideal, but in lieu of that improbable outcome occurring, a universal standard that no one entity controls is a fundamentally more attractive compromise.
So that leaves Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as viable "fair candidates" for any universal money standard... and making the pitch for Litecoin or any other shitcoin makes a lot less sense than Bitcoin, at least right now.

This is a fun comment because you are trying to tell exactly how he's using the word valuable, even though it's actually only your (fairly idiotic) interpretation of how he was using the word.
Not every troll can be intelligent, after all. For every out there, there are a dozen little running around, proudly showing off how much stupidity they can pack into individual comments.
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:30:12
Your interpretation is silly, because it would be a debate about a subjective appraisal - it would essentially be like a debate over whether Vanilla or Chocolate is a better flavor. 
Opinions are not viable debate topics. Get real.

Bitcoin has intrinsic value (easily transferable across the Internet). Gold has absolutely no intrinsic value.

Au contraire, my hasty friend. 
[intrinsic]( belonging to the essential nature of a thing : occurring as a natural part of something
It is the **essential nature** of a bitcoin to be easily transferable across communicative media. That is **a natural part** of the token.
Apparently *you* don't know what "intrinsic" means, because you appear to be confusing it as a synonym for "material" which is kind of adorable, kind of hilarious, and kind of sad.
For future reference, you might want to bookmark dictionary.com (or some other such site) so you don't end up looking so silly on reddit! :)

No one is talking about price appreciation, troll. They're talking about the value/utility of the network.
Now stop trolling, troll.

"I got scammed, so therefore everyone must get scammed."
Yeah, solid logic there bro.

He wanted a bitcoin more than he wanted $1000, another person wanted $1000 more than they wanted a bitcoin. Doesn't really matter who; it was a voluntary transaction and both parties seem to be content with their lot.
You don't seem too bright, kiddo.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:13:23
Well, at least we have confirmation on the "not too bright" hypothesis.
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:39:48
Right. So now, at this point, saying it is just beating a dead horse and proving to the world that you aren't original nor funny.

Yes, and dragons roam the skies, and bananas are actually black holes in disguise, and also computer keyboards are sentient, and a cabal headed by gorilla-men abominations are in control of the Illuminati, and the color red will be elected for president of the United States of Super-America in 2017.

It makes perfect sense. You're trying to argue that it's irrelevant (it's not), but not backing up the claim that "it makes no sense" at all.
Then again, you're a Buttcoiner. I don't expect much out of you.

"Each new node is exponentially more valuable to the network than the previous one" is not at all the same claim as "The price of a bitcoin will grow exponentially as more merchants adopt it", no matter how awful bad you wish it were.

Oh, you mean that the most-recently-mined coins of his are completely impossible to tell apart from other coins mined in 2010, 2011, or 2012?
