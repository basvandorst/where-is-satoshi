Told my uncle about bitcoin yesterday. He's a big time stock market guy. Got a call from him just now saying that he read a report somewhere that it might go to 1 million by 2020. He wants to buy one and just wants to forget about it then. He will HODL. :-D

I know dude. It's so sad. The exchange is literally like... Screw this person in particular :-(

Maybe pushing it too much. I think 20k will be hit mid 2018. At the moment it's trying to stabilize at 11.5 to 12k.

I kept waiting and it kept going up.

Wtf man :-( I'm with pnc bank... Does the first transfer take this long?

Ach transfer is ridiculous from bank to gdax. The email says 4 days but it's still not transferred... I sent the request on Tuesday

Send them a support ticket. They resolved the issue quite quickly for me.

Every. God. Damn. Time. I sell right before the rally.

U go into accounts. There should be three tabs in history. Click transfer. It should show there. On gdax

I would if my deposit would go through on GDAX. It says estimated payout december 6th. I sent the request two days ago. :-(
