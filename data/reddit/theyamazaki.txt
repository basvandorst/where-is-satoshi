Great job, AJ and Joseph!

US stocks for now, but some of the indices and ETFs have an international focus (Emerging Markets, Brazil, etc.).  Commodities-focused ETFs will also be available.

You invest in the sense that you get price exposure and would receive dividends, for example.  You won't have voting rights, though.

You do receive bitcoin (and other natively supported cryptos) directly in your HD wallet on the client side.  The "synthetic" assets are 2-of-2 bitcoin-collateralized contracts, with one of the keys residing on the user's phone.

Seems like it.  I think they have to comply with Apple and Google country restrictions (e.g. can't use app in Iran or N Korea), but it says 155 countries in the announcement.

Your investments are backed by the bitcoin collateral on your phone.  How would you invest in stocks without trusting a 3rd party?

I'm not your buddy, pal, nor am I a lawyer, but I would assume the bitcoin, which serves as collateral on the user's phone, would serve to partially make you whole in the event of bankruptcy.  Abra states they regularly increase or decrease your BTC collateral in accordance with how market prices have impacted the value of your positions.  In addition, the underlying assets (stocks, in your example), which are in Abra's possession, would be liquidated in a timely fashion in accordance with US laws.  How those would get distributed to users is a question for the courts.  I understand your skepticism.  It's natural.

He had a successful business before bitcoin was created, to be fair.

Definitely not tether.

Not really - ABRA is non-custodial and they allow you to invest in 20 cryptos.

True, but I did feel, on a recent trip to Tokyo, that there were a surprising number of businesses with "bitcoin accepted here" signs.  Also, to your point, a lot of ads for exchanges.  The government has, though, given its blessing for cryptocurrencies in general, so I believe "virtual currencies", as they are known in Japan, are on the path to becoming totally legitimate.

Nope, Yahoo returned my sent mail.  I verified I used the correct address.  My question was basically why the amount showing as available in My Wallet was positive, but the amount available for my checkout was still zero.  Honestly I gave up after waiting awhile and withdrew my money.  Also, for some reason your mobile website displays in debug mode on my device.  Not exactly filling me with confidence.

Having difficulty reaching your support.  Yahoo returns a failure message indicating the address is likely spam.  Can you help me out here?
