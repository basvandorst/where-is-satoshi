when ppl shit there pants, then thats the bottom, i would say blood in the streets but probably not going to happen. so when you start hearing bloomburng and CNBC talk about how bitcoin is over, then thats the bottom. until that, go short it so you can make some money
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:16:01

Russia has to covert the USD it gets to rubles to use in economy, every countries  that sells oil does the exact same thing, countries that dont have oil either trade there currency for usd then buy oil or export goods to USA(like china does) to get dollars to buy oil.

its always a good day for the bears in bitcoin, pitty everyone except a few are bulls. if there were more bears, the bulls could pull them out of there shorts and cause more buying pressure but since everyone in bitcoin is retarded and hopes it go to the moon.Wont happen for awhile, they could have paid there houses off, retired, sent there kids to college in the past year, just being a bear.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:40:13
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:34:33
plus since the whole US population is retarded and cant do decimals, you better hope it goes below 100 or stays there for awhile. Atleast that is easy math for them. You need like 10 more million ppl in Bitcoin or other cryptos to even get the feet wet. look for next halving. I mean look at the slow market for a year prior to the 1st one. and the bearmarket prior to that after the 35$ spike. go learn how to make money going down instead of setting up your price ticker on your phone and google watch. and read a few books on trading and trend lines. and look at some big charts... price is always already priced into the news. this isnt the stock exchange. you can insider trade here.

its called accumulation! Distribution happens at the top. You should be happy the price is staying low for such a long time. Means you have plenty of time to load up before the boat takes off. The longer the price stays down like this the harder the rally in a year from now. So quit looking at price and look how many bitcoins you can keep getting.
@_date: 2014-11-14 06:25:47
i thought it was funny, 
@_date: 2014-08-12 23:21:37
so i guess the guy really is stupid! only knows how to count other peoples money
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:09:10
we should be happy the price is coming down, everyone out there thinks you need to buy a whole coin, let the shit come down to 10$ then mass acceptance.
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:38:29
thanks but im speaking the majority of the ppl on here that cant figure out bitcoin is in a down trend
@_date: 2014-12-29 19:33:42
yeah he buys stock with insurance premiums, the money keeps coming in he keeps buying
@_date: 2014-12-18 07:36:31
exactly the bid sizes get larger on the way down. Max Pain not achieved yet. you should put in a bid order for 100$ *10 could possible get filled.

From reading the comments, I'm not sure you ppl understand what that provision says. It says that Derivatives, which are options contracts will be bailed out by FDIC. Well incase you didnt know, Derivatives get paid before anyones savings or checking accounts do. Also there are like 700 trillion in derivatives out there. And only like 25 billion in FDIC. Make sure you put some cash in the mattress or stock up on your bitcoins. Even buy some currency in some oil producing countries.  If you dont know what the Shemitah cycle is google it. Its next year and also the year of jubilee. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 05:27:36
well they are all the 99%, fuck em. I love being a 1%er. When they realize they are missing the boat. Once it hits 10k, cuz by this point most will only be able to get like .05 they will be trying to buy the shit out of it. And push the price up. If only 10million ppl in the next 2 years buy .05 bitcoin thats like 500k BTC. that is alot of coins. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:24:13
let the dump begin!!!! i wanna see ppl shitting there pants when it hits $100

you tell me you call yourself a troll "As a bitcoin troll, you guys make it too easy. It's just sad how this community downvotes well argued non-troll positions that they happen to disagree with.
Bearish on bitcoin? Downvote. Think the bitcoin UI is clunky? Have a downvote. Think that there are advantages to using fiat? You better believe there's a downvote waiting for you.
The problem isn't the Bitcoin technology. The problem is that r/bitcoin is filled with emotionally stunted socially awkward man-children, which is a troll's paradise. You bring this upon yourselves."

@_date: 2014-10-13 05:31:09
completely agree!
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:47:01
well if it gets to 100$ thats well before most ppl ever bought, also i bet they're tons off ppl that bought on credit card with money they dont have and are staring at a big ass CC bill every month praying... anyone that bought over 400 and sees 100.. and it was borrowed money will probably sell for sure. And if that happens were looking at a possible candle wick down to hopefully 50. im sure there are a shit ton of buy orders down there. were ever you see the largest buy order on the book. thats the possible low.

I own shares of AMD, I wrote their investor relations ppl about adding some extra hashing power to there new chips so while people arn't playing games they can mine bitcoin. Yes i know they can already do that now, but i was talking about adding to the chip. Next day all the stuff about cards being sold out hit the news. Hopefully they get the hint!
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:25:30
why to do wanna take someones vault! just because a dude has the coins on cold storage and is passing them down the family line, doesnt give you the right to take his wealth!!! Bitcoin is the way it is so shit like that doesnt happen!!! Quit trying to rob people!
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:06:34
Normal people wont start buying it until its over 10k, the reason is because they are broke. And realized loses are the worst loses. Really nobody even heard of it at 250, 1k, still someone might be like what is bitcoin, but thats as far as it goes except, how much is it, Fuck that 1k!, After 10k People will still be like damn i could have bought a new car! If i would have just bought one, So they buy .1 hoping for it to goto 100k for a btc. Once it gets to 100k they sell the .1, blow the whole thing in a few weeks. And back to zero,,, then they say damn that was easy ill just buy $1000 worth again, so they get .001,  and thats how we get to a million a coin!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:37:33
what ever u do, dont sell!
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:29:50

normal ppl dont need to get into bitcoin till its at the top of the S curve. Then they can work at biz that we all own and get paid in bitcoin we bought today! This is why most high risk investments are for accredited investors. Cuz if not, everyones wife would be calling the place asking why its going down and why its going up, that dont make sense and wanting to withdrawl there money all the time... Only making the fund or security worse off

Whether you think you can or think you can't your right either way! What ever you believe in your mind will be your reality. Also go read the about who started the FED then come back and tell me people can't just make money for doing nothing... The FED bankrupted the US GOV in its first year, so they had to start the income tax just to pay the interest on the money in circulation. If you dont know about about any of this stuff, its a nice rabbit hole to fall into. You will probably be like WTF. How is this possible!

I got a few that i work with to get into it, and most are getting educated on what it is, and are buying on the dips. But people back home,,, Not a f clue what bitcoin is. They dont even know what the FED is. If i asked them they would say the federal gov. And probably 8 out of 10 would say the dollar is backed by gold. When it was at 450 I tried to tell my family to buy just one, just one is all I ask you buy.... Nothing! Even as it rose to 1200+ never asked about it. I just gave up on all of them... You can bring a horse to water but you can't make it drink. Once I start telling them to not worry about the price and just look at it in a couple years and to think about the tech behind it... I just watch there eyes gloss over. The lights went out. I'm talking to a empty shell that is envisioning lambo's and boats and hoes. I figure they would sell the thing at 10k anyway to pay for a new iphone and some shoes and cloths and a down payment on a used benz... People and there broke mind set is rediculous!
