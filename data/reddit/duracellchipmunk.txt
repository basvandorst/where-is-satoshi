Well if it goes to 50k it’ll go to 100k
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:39:34
Lol. Ok no
@_date: 2019-07-24 20:49:19
Agreed, but that's more of a btc trader. You could increase your holding by playing the surges and dips, but unless you have more than 1, I wouldn't recommend it.

He called something a negative so all the media will call it a positive.

Honestly, if you're a hodler, checking the price regularly is truly a disservice to your life.

That's essentially what my wife said. She's like "you're the total nerd, if you think it's legit and worth some money, then go for it just not too much, we need to eat."

Debit cards will be irrelevant. The trillion dollar business of lending cards (aka. credit cards) though will find a way.  
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:59:18
I plan on buying real estate with bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-11-04 18:30:35
I looked at op post history to see the agenda and got lost.
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:53:12
Eventually credit card companies will switch over to bitcoin, the currency is generally irrelevant as long as it's accepted. 
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:05:38
I'm from Chicago and so this always sits with me as the greatest opportunity. A place like [this]( is probably a shit storm... but with 55k down and a 100k update. You could be sitting pretty with three units pulling in 2k a month. Pay off the mortgage quick. Use the building as collateral. Buy another. Rinse. Repeat.
Get 5 buildings. Hire a property manager for 50k a year. Live off 300k a year.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:50:50
Just need one property with multiple units really.
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:59:27
Over 100k and Under 300k - and I heard a 30k(ish) bottom.

Our past is scarier. It’s always been tenuous and uncertain, but don’t listen to the crazies. 99.9% of us are at home loving our families and friends and just trying to be happy.

There’s a video on the 16 year asset cycle that seems close to that prediction.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:29:33
You're both dumber...
Don't get me wrong, love the btc... but own some bonds, real estate, stocks, 401k, &amp; bitcoin. The one thing to not own is a savings account in a bank. Any sort of high liquidity investment is better than a savings account... you're losing money in savings accounts.
That also said, I'd risk it on bitcoin first if I had nothing. I see it as an anti-poor guarantee.

This is not a case where I can only get so hard. My hardness will not stop hardening.

I’ll be that guy. There’s going to be a post in 2026:
The year is 2019, October 3rd. What is your course of action?
Buy bitcoin when it was 8,200
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:03:21
This is actually true, and the 2 month cycle is about complete. I would say buy now of forever hold your peace.

Wheres the pop up located today?
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:41:08
I'm with you. I'm pretty much out of money. I bought .02 of some recently during this dive. I saw a post saying just try to get to .25 and I'm close to that.  So who knows! I just don't want to be poor.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:45:30
Consider it jinxed... last time it hit 10k it blasted through. Well see this time.
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:38:35
Thanks. They’ll never need to work a day in their life thanks to me, but they’ll never know that.

Inflation rate to gdp growth is steady though. No one *likes* it, but it's how things have operated and currently usa is operating at safe levels. This op bought their first hardware wallet 5 days ago, let's not take him too seriously.

LOL would like to have a word

This is good for bitcoin

I’ve heard these magic numbers before...A mysterious person say 300k is the next top and the next bottom being 30k....

No send me 1 and I’ll send 10 back through the atm
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:07:02
You kinda buy now no matter what. The thing hit 20,000, anything below 20,000 is now the discount. 
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:43:24
Outside of reddit I'd guess extreme libertarian red. They'll take anything to reduce government power.

yeah, but it doesn't help to instil fear. People should stay in the game. 
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:10:15
a lot of people argue that bitcoin history can't be used as a predictor. These look very similar but operating at 4X. All I'm doing is predicting bitcoin will go to somewhere between 13,500 and 16,000 in the next 2 weeks.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:41:09
Yes if you did the same with btc you’d have $10,500, but more importantly 1 btc
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:50:37
The recession that people feared since the last recession? There are better ways to live your life.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:41:58
It’s a simple prediction indicator on 16 year asset cycle
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:21:42
yeah, well, to be honest, it's either this or the time frame also 4xs as well, but that hasn't been consistent. The recent run has been consistent to previous time frames, the price has just been a lot higher.
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:45:48
Well my stock that i bought for at $3500 in January is at $3700... BITCH! Lol such loser.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:23:01
i think it will have another 2 months stagnation at a higher price...15Kish i would gather
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:30:59
I have a friend who doesn’t check ever and has like 2 btc. He said the news will tell him. I agree. I’m obsessive.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:08:12
In 2 years it will be 250-300K, in 3 years it will be between 30-40k, in 5 years it will be between 750k-1mil. Do a remind me. The 16-year cycle is clearly in place.

As I'm typing this my aussie friend said don't, the prices are adjusted AF.

I agree with this. The battle isn't against gold. Fiat is the joke.
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:13:09
You feel for those guys. And they still have the chance now and won’t buy... anything under 20k is on sale. This should dip, but like previous times... it’s not guaranteed.
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:17:39
... it was late... i thought it was clever...thanks i hate myself

k thnks byyeeeee
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:50:00
I imagine a wallet with bitcoin and nano on it. Your bitcoin requires non-stress retina scan, authenticator, mothers maiden name, call your best friend and your first car to convert any bitcoin to nano. While you just buy coffee with nano no questions asked.
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:14:42
It could dip, which then buy even more, but you’re still getting in on prime time.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:36:12
Interesting point but hard to sell in this space with the current animosity towards inflation/government. I guess mining is a sense of adding currency, but is there a project that has this considered?
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:42:59
Warren Buffet just renewed his hate for bitcoin saying it doesn't do anything, because watch a piece of hard to counterfeit paper do amazing tricks that are constantly losing value because governments want more of it and then tell the paper it's needed across the planet and not get there without arriving at -$29 of its value and fees.

@_date: 2019-05-09 03:48:26
We won’t see 4000 again, but we might see 5000 again. Low chance but all indicators say if it gets there pull an nsync buy buy buy.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:21:37
Agreed, but I think 3-5% of consumers actually think that way. And although that 3-5% may be the upper echelon of spenders, they’re motivated enough to invest/spend to make more money. All generalizations and opinions though on my part.
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:20:43
and it still hurts from last time.gif
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:34:31
You're either catching a falling knife or missing out on 15% gains. The best thing to do is buy while it's low in comparison to ATH... In case anyone is wondering. The price of btc has dropped a little this past year. It's good timing now.

There was a wall of sell orders at $6400 and that wall is gone. That said I have buy orders in at 5700.
