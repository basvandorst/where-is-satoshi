Yeah me too, but used a mean reversion trade at 9,200 EUR to recover... I accidentally introduced a bug in the stop loss routine of one of my trading algorithms that really nailed me on that one. But alas...

I have been really careful not to get drawn into any of the crypto wars and always be objective but for the first time : that guy is a giant piece of dog s

But only the miners have something to say. As a trader there is nothing one can do except watch the situation unfold as the currency crashes. How are the voices of the users heard in the process?

I get nobody owns it so you could argue the other way. But surely the option that causes the least damage to the overall community should prevail. The least damage is done by BU starting fresh?

In which way are they invested? That investment does not go away since bitcoin is still there. Miners can also gradually move hash rate over as BU grows?

Its different since it is the actual chain that has value. Alt coons are only relevant because people like me do on exchange arbitrage between alt coins. We double the number of relevant coins that hold real tangible value.

See that is where we differ. Eur/Dollar is not the same dynamic as in cryptocurrencies. Fiat reflects an econmic regions buying power and structure. It is correlated by nature to different things like what is happening in the currency that uses the fiat. Cryptos all serve the same market. At a Macro level they are all the same serving the same market for the same purpose. So if you look at cryptos as a entirety and i do mean relevant cryptos that have trust of value then it has split.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:43:34
You think the market has not priced the split in before it happened?

There are lots of cryptos but only a handful with real value and tangible value beyond speculation. At $400 BCC part of this already.

I have been a quiet lurker for years on these bitcoin communities. I have seen how the community has time and time consumed itself through aimless fights to the detriment of progress in the crypto space. Excite, Lycos , Alta Vista did not win the search wars since there was a real benefit to being a second mover where google could learn from the mistakes of the first movers that all became derivative copies of each other. The Facebook coin might not meet the idealistic goals of the crypto community but that is not what matters. Whether the average consumer will use it is what matters. And we can see that consumers gladly dispense with tons of private information and willingly trust central control to the likes of google everyday since the services are useful. The massive people networks that Facebook has for their coin in the shape of WhatsApp and general FB is not to be ignored just because of purest crypto ideals. It is instantly useful if executed well. Given the state of mempool and the costs it is not surprising that it is not a pure crypto. They need to scale to Facebook scale. Involving traditional finance is master stroke since they will be happy to back Facebook to lead them into this new era. I would be less quick to dismiss this development. People laughed at the iPad launch the same way the bitcoin crowd is scoffing at Libra.

There was definitely filled orders all the way down in the trade history widget. There is no way that anything chewed through the standing orders. So the question is who are the lucky ones that got filled? And why are there not hordes of people shouting profanities at Kraken? Something smells rotten here...

Great example of Polyamory working. Stunning...

What do you mean "could be"? It's been for the longest time...

It must be nice to have a business where even when you give crappy ui, execution and kyc process you still thrive.

Don't worry. We can deflate those 21 million coins through chain splits till the end of days!!! To Bitcoin version &gt; 9000. To think in two short months we could have four different chains. Cry the beloved Bitcoin...

Have you done any transactions on tier 2? I have helped a few people with their setup and noticed that as soon as you are actually a paying customer tier 3 verifications happen a lot quicker. Their twitter support is also a lot more responsive than tickets.

This is not manipulation at all like some comments are saying. One of the first strategies I coded when I started trading a while back is to arb between the various coins to fiat. It is obvious strategy. It does mean that all the coins are highly correlated. You want people like me cause it brings liquidity and efficiency to market.
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:04:23
I don't know if it will prevent people accepting crypto. The real problem is that there is fundamentally no difference between coins from an investor/trader point of view. They all become conduits for different arbs. The funny thing is that right now its only practical to do it on exchange that has multiple coins. The lack of scaling and high fees makes it hard to do cross exchange. Once scaling is addressed this will happen broadly.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:58:54
Every geek that codes and has a reasonable mechanic trading aptitude would code this strategy making it that efficient and large. No need for tin foil hats just yet ;-)
