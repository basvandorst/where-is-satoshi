I don't know actually. Apple basically just overturned a law in Denmark that goes something like:


In Denmark you pay a lot for electricity as a consumer but close to nothing if you are a firm. If you are allowed to sell the heat you could probably make money by having a plant of toasters wasting electricity. This is obviously just stealing money from whoever actually pays for the electricity.
I assume that a ton of datacenters will be build in Denmark in the years to come in order to exploit this very obvious loophole that Apple has either convinced someone stupid to create or just straight out bribed into existence.
Either way I have absolutely no confidence in our politicians to overturn this obvious stealing which saddens me.

I support this. While I think developers are best suited for the job of deciding things like this, I feel that at this point things have gotten out of hand considering going either way wouldn't break anything irreversibly (for now at least). I'm more worried about developers throwing in the towel in anger than I am of the decision going against my opinion. While this vote of course couldn't possibly decide the better choice I think it is a valid way to get the ball moving again.

There is no reason to use PoW to spend resources when we already have bitcoin. 
By no means do I think a democratic solution is good. What I do think is that when the developers cannot come to an agreement they need external pressure in order to ensure that we are moving forward. When neither side gives in we are left with something worse than if either side won. Voting with your bitcoins could possibly give the discussion the kick it needs in either direction in order for us to move on from this discussion.

As you have written a wall of text and i don't really see the point of forcing my opinion on others i'm only going to give a brief response.
First thing to remember is that bitcoins goal isn't to replace ALL forms of currency - why would it?
We are in the early days of development and a lot of what you see as problems is going to be solved. You mention having to wait several minutes for confirmation of transaction but what you and the business has misunderstood is that there is no reason whatsoever to wait for one confirmation. You may respond to this by yelling double-spend but i will challenge you to read up on double-spending - it is a non-issue(!!!). Bitcoin transactions are instant and there is absolutely no reason to wait for a confirmation if the paying process is set up properly.

We are no where near the point where appealing to the mainstream is necessary or even good. It seems like a good portion of sees it as a mission to bring the bitcoin to the mainstream "as fast as possible" either because "they saw it first" and wants to "show the world that they were right" or because of the predicted monetary gain that would come with mainstream adoption.
I, for one, think that it would be beneficial for bitcoin to be adopted by dedicated professional people who would not care half a second about what we call the default unit before mainstream adoption.

I don't want bit. I am not against using a secondary unit and I think it is smart to chose the unit which only has two digits after the dot. But I am very much against the name bit as it is widely used for other purposes and inherently means "something small". Do we want our currency to sound like it is not worth a lot?
I am very much in favor of using SI units as it removes all confusion that might come of using two units for bitcoin interchangeably. Any one of the below would suffice:
* µbtc
* µBTC
* Mu btc
* Micro btc
As much as I like the SI system I would be happy with any unique word or any word that at least does not already have meanings in related fields (finance and computers).

The world is still looking for a stable bitcoin exchange out of the reach of strict governments. Historically the best exchange in this regard has been btc-e which on the same time is extremely shady (mostly because of the methods for funding - the fact that the owners are hiding just might be a good thing).
There is a need for an exchange which has no ties to the US and not under Chinese law. Money needs stability!

The bigger problem here is that we do not really know what coins are considered stolen. For what we currently know there could still be as much as 550k bitcoins left in MtGox. I have been tracking the coins and not without success but the lack of information from MtGox makes it hard to do anything but speculate. I have emailed the appropriate people regarding 350k coins but they have all been stone-walling me. This could of course mean that I have hit the nail but it could also mean that I didn't and they view my emails as spam.

Gavin has found a practical solution (we all knew it existed we just didn't know which way to best implement it) for the following problem:
Imagine 3 pools each with 33% of the network hashing power. Two of the pools each find a valid block at the exact same time and send that block to the third pool. Whichever block is the smallest is likely to reach the third pool first. Whichever block reaches the third pool first will have 66% of the network hashing power backing the block while the losing pool only has 33% and thus will on average lose the next race.
This makes it possibly smart (havn't done the math) to only include transactions with high fees to keep the block small.
The solution is to make all blocks take equal time to transfer no matter what size they are. Gavin seems to have found a way that he thinks will solve the problem the neatest way possible. As i already said - we all knew what had to be done we just didn't quite know how to do it best. Gavin seems convinced he found a good way.

Basically it is not the first thing needing fixing. But as the current system goes our lead developer thinks that what we have is scaleable enough to run on hosted servers but probably not on home computers. What we need to do in the future is one of three:
* Fix the scalability problem by doing some magic computer science
* Use thin clients for consumers and incentivize running full clients so centralization won't become a problem
* hope that computers and the internet will outscale our problem

The second you get your new super ASIC you overclock it and cool it with liquid nitrogen - whatever you can because it doesn't matter how much it costs to run.
Over time when the ASIC gets surpassed it won't make sense to run it at all. But if you underclock it you are likely to get a better hash/watt because of simple thermodynamics (also why we don't see processors at more than 3 ghz).

With 3 TH/s you should net 0.38503697 BTC per week at current difficulty. The block reward is currently 25 btc which means you should mine for 65 weeks in average to find a block. But the difficulty changes every 2 weeks which means it will have changed 33.5 times and the difficulty rises 5-25% every 2 weeks at the moment. Chances are that difficulty will go through the roof (of your hashing power) before you find a block and thus you are likely to never find a single block.
If you want to play the lottery instead of getting a fair share (pool) then solo mining with 3 TH/s is a fun way to do it. Your odds will be as follows:
at this difficulty (two weeks) you will expect to solve 1/32.5 blocks
at the next difficulty you will expect to solve 1/(32.5+x), where x is the change in difficulty.

You did not include any examples so there is no specific case for me to comment on. I will, however, comment under the assumption that the proposed changes would affect the core principles. 
Bitcoin is a system that has promised its user base that it will never change the core of how it works (f.x. there will never be more than 21M btc). If your suggestion changes one of the many core principles then you will be met with all kinds of hate simply because you are trying to change the foundation which will and must be met with a decisive NO. A cross borders financial system must remain impartial to be taken seriously. That means never changing the core.

A login system where something is signed with a private key is fantastic. But the sad part is that it cannot be as easy as a password unless the signing is done by a piece of hardware (not very different from yubikey but done in another way (yubikey is only 2FA not the actual login)). If done without hardware one would need both a password AND the signing process which kind of sucks.

The point i want someone to take away from this post is that 135k coins were moved from MtGox addresses without being withdrawn (at least it is not recorded in btc_xfer_report) and then afterwards deposited into MtGox in smaller amounts by the user called 2c03f35d-6a78-4367-8fe2-355c248d212a. This was either a massive withdrawal of 134,897.01 BTC that was created by hand and NOT recorded in btc_xfer_report on 2011-06-19 20:21:33 (the very same day that MtGox was hacked and the price tanked (not necessarily related)) or else this was fraud/theft.

Besides the pirate talk i see absolutely nothing new. Satoshi said that for optimal privacy do not reuse addresses. This paper just adds pirate talk. The only thing different is that it is not possible for a dumb user to spend only half the inputs and thus transfer user knowledge from one address to the change address(for the recipient). 
To the author: You wasted my time. You could at least have written a proper explanation in the top saying that this basically is just a user interface that prevents people from leaking information by forcing new addresses and spending all the inputs.

It is sad to see this happen. Bitcoin is not much older than four years and so far (for good reason) the focus has been on making the most stable (network-wise) and feature-full (transactions are fully programmable) system as possible. There is no focus from the bitcoin-core developers (neither should there be) on making bitcoin safe for the person who does not understand bitcoin (and netsec in general). The security is exclusively handled by the end-user (which really is a core function) and if you fail to understand the technical side of bitcoin and netsec in general then there is a very real risk that you will get robbed by someone who does understand it.
Bitcoin will become secure for the unknowing three-year-old *in the future* but as long as the bitcoin-core is still under development it is insensible to expect security for the unknowing.

To that point: regulating businesses that hold bitcoins *for* costumers is fine; i.e. mtgox and coinbase should be regulated. Regulating businesses that deal with bitcoin by owning it or by accepting it as a form of payment is *not* ok. Also businesses that function as an exchange or otherwise controls the flow of value *without* holding a single private key (multi-sig where the exchange only has control of a single key that only facilitates but doesn't initiate transactions) should *not* be regulated.

The real reason for this behavior (if anyone wonders) is that addresses are meant (when developed by satoshi) to only be used ONCE. This improves anonymity a lot but the real reason is that when you sign a transaction you salt it with a random number and if anyone is able to guess that random number then they can calculate the private key. While noone has found an exploit yet, an address which has already spent an input is actually less secure than an address which has never spent an input.

In my albeit unimportant vision of bitcoin in the future scalability is a non-issue. Smaller chains will be financially bound to the bitcoin blockchain while maintaining their own blockchain which in turn can be thrown out at certain "checkpoints" that updates the bitcoin blockchain.

First i pasted the private key into brainwallet to find out if there were any spendable inputs. Blockchain.info is pretty but has a lot of problems with their database so i used [
to find out if there were any spendable inputs. There were four (these four were already spent but in transactions that would never confirm because one of the inputs were already spent). Then i used brainwallet to craft a raw transaction using the four inputs. Brainwallet doesn't manage double-spends all that well so i actually had to create another transaction as a scaffold and then change all the data manually to create a valid transaction. When i had a raw transaction i pushed it via my own bitcoind since blockchain.info/pushtx doesn't work with double-spends. The transaction propagated most of the network just fine (but didn't show up at blockchain.info before it was included in a block). 
Edit: and now blockchain.info shows a balance of 0.0019548 on the address but this doesn't exist. Blockchain.info really has some problems with their code.

I'm a scientist - not a financial adviser, lawyer or anything remotely related. I can only give advice related to how I personally chose an exchange. 
I need my exchange to be in a country that I trust to behave nicely. I don't trust the United States (they take any chance they get to "confiscate") or China (too many bans and laws about money going in/out of the country). 
Being from Scandinavia I need my exchange to accept SEPA since SEPA is a lot faster and cheaper than a regular wire. (a lot of exchanges accept SEPA through a bank in Europe even though they are not located there)
I don't trust Bitstamp (from UK aka little US, too strict with KYC harassing legal customers)
I don't trust Kraken (the address is in the US)
I don't trust btc-e (looks pseudo-legal so even though btc-e might behave nicely there is no guarantee that &lt;insert government&gt; will.)
I have heard IRC chatter about Singapore or Hong-Kong being possible choices but i do not have any incentive to look up their laws and past behavior.
I'm going to register at the next exchange that convinces me that they will never lock my money and is professional enough to not lose my money on their own. I'm fully legal in every way so i hate that i have to deal with stuff like this. I will not join an exchange that harasses people with sh*tty US law guilty until proven innocent and then no money back that shouldn't even apply outside the US.

Sure it is true that you can lose a trademark by not defending it. But that is not at all relevant to this case as no infringement to the trademark is being made. I will stop responding now as it has not been pleasant talking to a brick wall.

I have nothing to do with circle. My guess is that circle has found out that an extreme amount of fake users are being created and buys $500 which is the max? with stolen credit cards and then withdraws the bitcoin. I don't know where circle gets their bitcoin from but if they were prebought to at least some extend then this would explain the selling pressure as well.

Hmm.. I don't believe what you describe to already exist. Many SSH servers use some kind of ECDSA for the login process but that cannot be easily used for your project as it doesn't concern neither bitcoin nor web applications. 
I believe it would be possible to (relatively easily) create an exe file that would ask bitcoin-qt to sign a message and then push that message to your website. But that is kinda messy since bitcoin-qt would need to run etc.

For writing such a long post i doubt you spent a corresponding amount of time thinking about the matter.

i wouldn't call it a security hole. It could be a problem if someone is trying to scam someone else who doesn't understand how the bitcoin system works. Sure mining pools shouldn't accept double spends as long as the first transaction will confirm eventually but i don't think the bad-guys pools care. This is one of the real reasons we need to push the sheep-miners towards p2p-pools. Some (if not a lot of) miners think that being in a pool with a large hashrate somehow will increase their own bitcoin mining. If we could somehow educate them and get them to join p2p-pools then this wouldn't be a problem.

Never mind the simpleminded people who actually focus on people instead of ideas. I have high hopes for your work on tree-chains.

I hope that the usage of altcoins in tree-chains is necessary as i do not like the whole idea of altcoins as anything else than experiments in the first place. I hope that bitcoin will be easyer to scale and more flexible through tree-chains who in turn will depend on the absolute stability of bitcoin.

If you spend just a small amount of time on the blockchain you can see the direct connection with MtGox donation address. While you can argue plausible deniability the coins were moved in a way to specifically indicate MtGox ownership (moved in a small time window, first consolidated then split in 4k blocks and then not moved). So if no nefarious play was involved in 2011 when the cold storage was created then we know that f.x. 1PNNF is gox. So since 1PAzo is bitstamp and bitstamp use unique addresses to receive coins then 1DJoA is bitstamp aswell. Now the only question is - who owns 1JFXQ
@_date: 2014-08-30 20:01:02
Nope. Dark Wallet is not magic so it won't do anything without a little bit of work. But if you ask Dark Wallet to do so you can use its implementation of coinjoin which is one of the better methods currently in use.

Edit: not trying to scare you off - just go read a little wiki article or something. Coinjoin is not perfect but it is good.

That is just plain wrong. There will only ever be a difference if the time it takes to solve a block is significant compared to the 2016 block change of difficulity. So as long as your pool solves several blocks per 2016 block then everything is fine.
I just did some pseudo-correct math and if you have a 15% increase of difficulity and one pool has 50% hashrate and another pool has 5% hashrate then a miner in the smaller pool will earn 0.133929% less than in the big pool. That is just nowhere near the potential loss of bitcoin price.

The only buyers i can imagine are people buying this as a gift for someone they think "loves technical stuff" but do not know them well enough to know what precise technical stuff they like.

It is pretty simple. If you cannot be sure of one of the following then you should create a new address:
* The original paper wallet was safe before import

* Mycelium signed the transaction with a properly random R value

I don't doubt that amazon is good as far as cloud goes. That doesn't change the fact that hardware access is a overwrite all hack.

While BIP70 doesn't reduce load it actually builds the foundation for another BIP that would in fact reduce the network load by only relaying to miners which in turn should be instructed not to forward.

The problem with knowing something about bitcoin is that unless you know a lot you will often see holes that are not actually there.
The fundamental strength of bitcoin is that it makes more sense for every individual to participate in the network instead of working against it. This doesn't change with the price of bitcoin. As an off-note ASICs were introduced to bitcoin in 2013. Before that all it took to get &gt;50% of the network was to buy a shitload of GPUs.

Not really. There are a bunch of exchanges where people put up bids and asks. You sell into the bids and buy into the asks. That is how the current "price" is determined. There can currently be sold 1550 btc instantly for a total of 880,000 US dollars before the price goes from 570 to 560 on bitstamp only. There are a lot of exchanges so the bid wall of just one does not tell the full picture. If you were to sell 1550 btc across all the exchanges chance is that you would not even be able to see it on the charts :)

I disagree. Firstly I think that Gavin is a remarkably level header man and that I am surprised that one like that was even around as early as Gavin was. Secondly Gavin doesn't even decide anything so the political problem was introduced by you. Thirdly I think raising the block limit 20 fold is the right thing to do. If he says the network can handle it then I believe him. So while scalability is fixed in a number of ways simultaneously I think raising the limit is the right thing to do for now. Lastly I don't like your proposal - it will make some blocks worth more than others in terms of security and it will possibly make a whole array of block withholding attack vectors. Bitcoin is a financial tool and as such must be stable as fuck.

The only reasons why a private firm would do that are:
* They don't have the money to produce the units so they pre-sell
* They do not trust the price of bitcoin to be stable untill the units ROI
A more consumer friendly market would arise if either happens:
* A consumer-controlled corporation is founded and succeeds in making units that perform on par with the competition.
* Everyone mines at a loss. This makes sense for a consumer if the loss is less than the reduction of home heating cost.

Ah. Well as I said I reserve my ultimate opinion on the matter but there is at least some merit to that "solution". Reaching the limit will still let important transactions go through as measured by fee so it won't be a complete disaster. It also prevents spam on the blockchain as could happen if a too large size is implemented. 1 MB worth of transactions won't be enough in the future but perhabs it is enough for now. Perhabs a solution will be developed before the 1 MB is a real problem. Either way it is not dumb or in the disinterest of bitcoin to argument in favor of the 1 MB size limit whether or not the limit turns out to be suboptimal.

You are correct in your assumption that if bitcoin price does not change for a significant amount of halvings then the network hash rate and with it the "barrier to entry" will lower to a level where a 51% attack might happen "for the lulz". What you might have missed is the fact that every time bitcoin block rewards halves there will be significantly less bitcoins to buy and thus the price should rise if the demand is unchanged.

I don't know what else you are doing but this survey on its own really says nothing about diffusion. Also it sounds like diffusion should be a problem? Bitcoin is a decentralized ledger of value. Once this is established you can use bitcoin however you like and however way you find easiest - also off chain. Everything plays together with at most one step from each other (with every off chain system you can withdraw and deposit). I don't find this diffuse. Yes there are a lot of bitcoin off chain systems but I don't find this to be diffusion per say since it is all backed by the ledger and is at most one step from the blockchain.

Any coins send to 1FYMZEHnszCHKTBdFZ2DLrUuk3dGwYKQxh will be unspendable.
If you go to  you can manually generate addresses for interesting numbers. You can f.x. generate the bitcoin address that has the private key "1". What you do is you put in the hex value for "1" in "private key" like "01". It then generates the bitcoin address 1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm. If you in turn input something interesting into "public key" you will still generate a working address but you will have no way to calculate what the private key is. If you f.x. put in "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" you will get "13VmALKHkCdSN1JULkP6RqW3LcbpWvgryV". What happened with OP is that MultiBit (for whatever reason) calculated the address for the public key "00" (try it - it will generate 1FYMZEHnszCHKTBdFZ2DLrUuk3dGwYKQxh). There is no way for anyone to ever calculate the private key for that address (at least before working quantum computers with working algorithms).
I have never used MultiBit and I would have advised anyone asking me not to use it. It is not the first time they have dropped the ball. My personal lists of professionally developed wallets include (in random order)

What you are missing is that bitcoin as a system derives it's value from it's userbase. The miners will very actively follow the mainstream's opinion on a hard fork because if they mine on the wrong chain they will lose all their block rewards. In the end it does not matter if initially 95% of the miners mine on chain A if the community (lead by the main developers as they are seen as wiser on the subject) choose to download a node that ignores chain A and acknowledges chain B as the correct chain.

I think you underestimate the professionalism of nullc and sipa. You also seem to have misunderstood what nullc and sipa might have to "gain" by keeping the size as is. Sidechains use the same commodity as bitcoin and thus there is no financial gain seeing as no one is selling anything. 
I would like to agree with Gavin mainly because it would be nice to scale the blockchain (convenience "argument"). I also find merit to his points in his blog about this very issue. On the other hand I also respect the opinions of nullc and sipa and thus I will reserve my ultimate opinion on the matter until more clear arguments are presented and more actual testing has been done. The very core of the issue is that in order to decentralize the blockchain a lot of people will have to be able to run a full node - this can only be accomplished if the full node can run on standard equipment. It will make sense to raise the limit on the block size to a equilibrium between block size and "enough nodes". What the block size for this equilibrium is is to be discussed and will even change when equipment changes.
I hope we in the future will see main-chain off-loading onto off-chains so the main-chain won't have to bother with unimportant transactions. But for now I am happy with the work of Gavin and I am constantly reminded of why he was the best candidate to take over the project for Satoshi - Gavin will do what seems to be best for bitcoin now and in the immediate future - he is not held up by "perfect solutions" and neither does he propose implementations that are not completely thought through.

You make it sound like bitcoins pub/pri keys are different than most in most systems. To my knowledge it is not. The difference here is that it is valuable to keep public keys from bitcoin IF it becomes possible to crack in the future while it would be easy to patch most other systems without loss there would probably be problems with bitcoin. The solution would be to migrate to a non-quantum-vulnerable system BEFORE it is feasible to find the private key.

The thing to discuss here is the difference in the constant values. The version bitcoin uses has values that makes sense f.x. "7". In the other implementation they use unexplained constants that are supposedly random but might as well make the curve weak to some exploit that NSA has. (Think of it like this: you can't find an exploit for a given curve but maybe it is possible to generate a curve that is exploitable if and only if you know " the secret" behind the constant value). Satoshi presumably (even though he to my knowledge never commented on the choice) realized this and took the safer choice. Bitcoin is actually pretty much the only one using this curve over the random one which is worrysome since NSA might be able to exploit those possibly insecure curves.

First of all; I'm for an increase to 8 MB. However, I find your approach to this (perceived by you) threat to bitcoin appropriate. I agree that letting the majority decide is wrong. I also agree that it is time to settle down a little (delete posts but reserve bans for trolls) and I even agree with your definition of an altcoin (this is new; I got convinced by this post). I think it is fair to say that my combination of opinions is either entirely unique or at least unvoiced here. So why am I entirely in agreement with you while running bitcoin-xt on my server one might ask. While I absolutely love your dedication to consensus and the fact that you are willing to make yourself the bad guy defending bitcoin vs a forceful hardfork I am very certain that 1 MB is more hurtful than what xt proposes. I do however also believe that better solutions exist. 
The ball has been on the court for too long - the time for a fork is NOW. Propose a big increase in blocksize now and slight increases there after. If bitcoin-qt doesn't propose an increase within the week it will either be replaced or go down in history as the prime example of why leaderless projects don't work.
@_date: 2015-08-04 07:01:21
I didn't realize you actually knew this much about it - sorry. Forget Electrum then. How about we as you say just tunnel into the server? No need to keep a local chain except if you are mining. And if you are mining you just have to keep both the price of electricity and availability of bandwidth in mind when choosing a location. And for the problem with miners mining on top of invalid big blocks I just don't see the problem - we have the bloom filters coming out soon so most of the work should be done already and I'd you receive a big block with a lot of transactions you don't know about the solution is simple; don't mine on top of it before validation.

I don't appreciate the condescending tone. It is well known that 51% attacks have their problems. It seems to me that you are unaware of the solutions to such attacks? One of the more powerful but also somewhat reckless solutions is to simply change the hashing algorithm ever so slightly leaving all current ASICs useless. It will never come to that - miners have a simple motive; all they want is money. As such they won't misbehave in fear of getting replaced.

Well, here are some of the emails: 
It was definitely Ross who send those emails as "Wesley". He got the information because someone leaked it to him. I can't remember whether it was leaked to him at a time where they actually thought it was you and Mark or at a time when they thought it was Ross.

A system is adequately decentralized if it can't be manipulated by any entity. Less developed countries can rely on SPV and so can tor. You can run a full node where possible and setup f.x. your own private Electrum server.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:07:07
That's what I want too. However, I think that having all of that is entirely incompatible with a solid 1 MB block size. At least if one wants the system available to any significant amount of users which I think is required in order to actually being able to exchange bitcoin with anyone.

I was actually the one finding those emails. Some of it is pgp encrypted but that which isn't is pretty much just Ross trying to get contact info for you and Mark in order to warn you of the investigation in which he had learned that they expected you two to be running SR.

The one problematic thing that you might not have taken into account is that there need not have been any transactions sent to nodes around the world. MtGox had a contract with Luke's pool to include all the transactions of MtGox. The transactions could be picked up from the MtGox api but were possibly never broadcasted. This makes it possible for an attacker to make an identical transaction with a different hash. Someone watching for malleability wouldn't see anything because they would only know of the malicious transaction. Sadly it is entirely possible that a significant amount disappeared this way.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:26:20

The condescension just never stops. Once a chain is 51% attacked it is more or less useless. It wouldn't take long for everyone to switch. The 49% of the miners are going to lose out - that's the cost. It wouldn't be a problem to go down in hashrate - the worst thing that can happen has already happened at the old chain.

You seem to have misunderstood one important thing about decentralization (or at least you overstate the importance). The degree to which something is decentralized doesn't matter - as long as bitcoin hasn't been or won't be manipulated it is absolutely decentralized enough. When we wish a higher degree of decentralization it is really only to make ourselves feel safer. 
Decentralization is not per definition an absolute state but the end result - whether something has been manipulated or not is. And that really is the only thing that is important.
@_date: 2015-07-05 10:36:06
Quick, honest and unbiased question:
You do not like an increase in blocksize. Since validation of transactions happen before they are included in a block (if exposed to the same transactions) why do you dislike an increase in the blocksize?
Is it because of the increased work in the 10-minute frame?
Is it because of maleficent block-producers?
Is it because of some third thing?
I realize this might be a tall order but I would appreciate if you answered with one of the above examples even though they obviously will be unfitting for a complete answer. I will in turn not question your answer as it will be incomplete in this context.
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:59:12
Mixing wallets is likely to lead to headaches. I would recommend you stick to one. If it is important to you that you can use a watch-only wallet that is also lightweight (no blockchain) I would recommend you to use Electrum. You can make a wallet in one place and then make a watch-only wallet that you copy to where ever it is needed. This way you can create unsigned transactions that will save as a text file that you can copy to your offline machine and sign and then copy back to the online machine/device and send. 
I would recommend that option. If, however, you want to use an offline Armory client then you will need to create the transactions with a full armory client (at least as far as I am informed).

You seem to think there is big difference between qt and xt. It's actually the very same code. xt just adds a few things. xt will also be released in a version that is literally qt with just the big blocks added. The current version of xt even runs as "bitcoin-qt" in the job list and uses the same appdata folder for the blockchain data.

Most participants would only have a single channel open. There will be LN nodes with lots of channels and those nodes are likely to fall under the regulation you talk about. But seeing as the system would ideally be at least pseudonymous and the whole world doesn't fall under US jurisdiction there really isn't much to worry about.
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:44:22
shuffling is only one method. Another would be to generate ~15 transactions and vary which transactions you include in the block. That would be almost entirely invisible.

The thing is - Coin_Artist made a puzzle before this which was a lot bigger and more involving. There was only 1 step out of maybe 50 that was misleading and it was corrected (maybe even by herself) within a day. When a puzzle is solved within minutes (solved as in: flames encode 4 bits in inner color, outer color, width, length and should be XORed by the ribbons) but it takes 3 years to claim the prize then obviously the author did not understand how degrees of freedom in a puzzle works. I'm sure Coin_Artist would agree that it was the wrong part of the puzzle that tripped people up - and that, at least to me, means it was a bad puzzle.
@_date: 2016-09-12 08:21:39
There are a few reasons. 
Some buyers are looking to buy drugs which at some point might make you unpopular at coinbase (they try to be the money police).
Some buyers (besides the drug buyers) don't want to validate with coinbase and are willing to pay a premium not to.
Some buyers are scammers so you will have to factor in some extra profit if your selling method is prone to scamming.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:17:05
The problem is not whether the puzzle is hard or not. The problem is when the puzzle is very easy but filled with arbitrary choices that the author makes that is in no way leaked. Authors of puzzles like this often do not understand how many degrees of freedom they introduce when they start down the path of taking random choices. What to them may look like 2 random 1 of 2 choices which would leave 4 combinations can very much become a 2^32 problem when seen from the outside. The puzzle was solved publicly within 10 minutes and probably privately within 2 but it took 3 years before someone claimed the price - does that look like a well made puzzle to you?
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:33:42
I spent a few hours on this when it was originally posted. It didn't take 10 minutes before everyone knew this was the solution -- it just didn't work so most dismissed it as a waste of time. The only thing making this last more than 5 minutes is the weird direction you have to use. People making puzzles like this have a tendency to not understand what parts of a puzzle will be hard and they do not understand how many degrees of freedom they introduce when they take arbitrary choices hidden behind non-leaky vails. Maybe it is hard to make a meaningful puzzle but this is just shameful. I had a spreadsheet with the flame and ribbon data trying to find the combination of directions that was required - I quickly realized it was a waste of time. The corner pieces are even in direct opposition to the required solution.
It is also not true that people focused on the chess part - it was dismissed because of the size.
Coin_Artist should have realized her mistake a week after and should have removed the prize - this was a shameful sequel to her first puzzle (which was equally arbitrary but which was at least always pushed ahead when stuck).

Fair enough - maybe we approached it with different expectations. I would absolutely love if there for once existed a truely great puzzle.

I think that it would. Using SegWit to describe the change SHOULD be fine but I do not believe it is. The victims of FUD will be able to look up whatever is being FUDed about and they will find substantial material (that they do not completely understand). This serves to enforce their belief that something important is being changed for nefarious reasons (yes, I do believe that having the dev team putting names to changes matters here). If something is simply being referred to as pull-req it helps to remove the political aspect from "our" side so that victims might realize that they are being manipulated once they see that only the FUDer seems to be politically and emotionally motivated.
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:28:53

Whatever he has done in the past doesn't matter much. We have Greg Maxwell on video explaining that part of the reason for the change was the "semi quadratic" issues with the old way. It doesn't take much of a genius to find an issue if you already know what the issue is and exactly where to look. /slowclap
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:47:16
I am of the opinion that packaging changes has a net negative result. There is an increased attack surface left open for FUD. An update with more changes than the average bitcoiner can fully understand is very easy to make look scary. 
It is also very problematic to NAME a change. No reasonable person would have anything against an optional addition to the consensus rules that allows whoever might be interested to perform nonmalleable transactions.
By naming a change it becomes significantly easier to start a political FUD or PUMP campaign. It is very common to use code names in software but Bitcoin is special and should not do so! Quasi-scams will make use of code names like "Metropolis" and "Ice Age" to pump price, excitement and dev-time.
Bitcoin is special and gains nothing from using code names; we don't want to attract unwarrented attention or price speculation and thus code names only serves to help the FUDers (it is significantly easier to FUD about something that externally verifiably exists (like SegWit and BlockStream)).
Bitcoin should strive to be boring as fuck. Stability and credibility is of utmost importance in a monetary system that wants to be taken seriously not just as a cool tech startup but as the primary candidate as the world reserve currency in 20 years™.
Bitcoin cannot rely solely on the experience of other projects and must define new and higher standards. Imagine having to convince a board to upgrade to [Psychotic Stoned Sheep]( instead of simply "Linux 4.7-rc1".

I noticed the fact that the 2-6 values added up to 267 and if you add  the 0's and 1's (267+76+73=416) you get a valid bit size for CoinGate's prefered wallet import format. I played around with ways of extracting bits from the ([a-z][2-6]) groups and I found a couple of ways that I found interesting that made some sort of internal valid logic. I was sad that none of them worked and now that you point out the vowel/consonant thing I got extra sad. (It took me 30 seconds to add an extra row with the vowel/consonant encoding and get the private key) All my experience and knowledge would have suggested to discard that idea the second it formed - grouping letters into vowels and consonants just seems like kindergarden stuff - the concept is absolutely void of interesting constructions.
Feedback to the author of the challenges:
1. Your job is to find interesting ways to represent data - picking an arbitrary amount of vowels (3) and consonants (8) to encode data with is a bad choice - it leaks no information (which it should) and acts to confuse (not in a good way; you encourage to look for higher meaning in constructions that apparently has none)
2. You have a tendency to add a last step of data manipulation (reverse, shift, skip) that essentially has no function but completely changes the challenge. F.x. you choose to reverse the binary string in the very end. This extra step has no real part of the challenge and it makes it very much harder to progress through the challenge in an intelligent and mindful way where you can get small hints about the validity of different data manipulations. When you cannot trust the author of a challenge to not use those tricks it becomes very hard to judge whether or not your chosen path is completely off track or if you just need that last step of [rot-47 + skip 33]. The challenge (after the very start of understanding the way the data has been laid out) essentially becomes a guessing game where you just throw random data manipulations at your data until someone finds the correct one. A good challenge has no extra layers of obscurity and is entirely centered around making sense of a novel and interesting way to represent data!
3. That being said - I absolutely love bitcoin challenges and I hope you will keep pumping them out.

Sure it is but so is picking $483. $650 is the only fair value as that was what a bitcoin traded for at other places around the time. However, because of the lack of reason coming from the trustee on other matters i'm just glad he didn't pick $100.

@_date: 2015-09-01 22:45:44
Not a throwaway - just a nondescriptive username. The information I have makes it nonsensical to say that someone took over SR late and did most of the illegal stuff. Since Ross said he started SR and we know he was there in the end and I know he was there in the middle there really is no doubt he broke the law - now the important thing is the consider whether the laws are fair.

I know not very much about this specific issue but I would venture a guess and say that Electrum doesn't know how to sign a message from a multi-sig address. Either that or the wallet doesn't have the keys available (you don't have both keys or you have forgotten to provide the password to unlock the private keys beforehand).

It is hard to second-guess why people are using the exchanges they do. I would, however, argue that what you are describing is more true for the Chinese exchanges.

The thing to understand is that it makes no sense to sell bitcoin miners. If you can produce them so that they make profit there is no reason to sell them. We saw that happen in the start of asics because the companies that dared start production didn't have the money or didn't want the risk. When they realized that they would make more money using them themselves instead of shipping them off that is just what they did. Nowadays you can't buy miners because it is considered less risky and the producers no longer seek other peoples money. This results in a very low amount of open pools making this attack less important. I think this is how mining is going to look from now and until people are willing to mine at a loss to generate heat. This in turn is not going to happen until it is common to heat by electricity which is not going to happen before green energy makes up the majority of energy production (which will be when green energy is cheaper in bulk than coal etc.).

There is a lot of misinformation in here or at very least information that is avoiding the most important fact. Headers first was implemented in bitcoin-qt version 0.10.

I like to imagine a future where mining won't be profitable for anyone. In that future people could have mining home heaters because it is cheaper to do a PoW than to just waste electricity. I think that having a very simple algorithm like sha256x2 helps to that end; simpler to make a miner and once SegWit activates we might never again see hidden optimisations.

Hmm. The fact that it revealed problems on your end does kind of change it. Nevertheless a non clueless person would never grant OAuth to an application if that was not exactly what they were trying to do. Perhabs it would be smart to require the application to know a secret that coinbase provides instead of approving the secret that the application provided? That is how most 2FA programs work and I see no reason why your OAuth applications shouldn't. The point of this is that the user would then specifically have to add the secret to the very application so that there is no confusion to what exactly you are giving your permission to.

I wouldn't say so. Going through the hands of the FBI simply "clears" the bitcoins in their view. It isn't up to the US gov to decide the fungibility of bitcoins anyway. One of the very powerful features of bitcoin is that no single entity decides anything at all. The potential power of bitcoin should it catch on at a institutional level sometimes scares me but I am usually quickly calmed by thinking of my Darwinistic views.

So the difference you are pointing out is that with this attack vector you not only have read access to the HDD but you are also able to inject malware. That changes things - I was wrong.

IANAL. I thought you could not bring in new evidence in an appeal case? I have never really understood that law since while it might be a pain it in my view should never overshadow a fair judgement.

Wow. Sorry in advance for all the negativity and elitist crap i'm going to spew out now:
That is just dumb! If a user falls for a phishing attack that does not exploit a hole in your system (which it doesn't sound like this did) then you are wrong to compensate them. You are to provide a system where it is possible to keep your money safe and not a baby-sit system where you pay out of pocket (investors and users(fees)) when some idiot practically gives his money away. If I was a black-hat i would look into how I could maintain a lot of accounts on coinbase and then simply transfer the bitcoins out and then show the community a phishing email. Easy way to double your money.

The prosecution among other things wrote the attached quote as a letter to the judge explaining why they did not want Andreas Antonopoulos in the court. To be perfectly honest I do not see any reason for him to be there either. Does anyone disagree for a particular reason?


a legitimate origin and legitimate purposes and uses. However, neither point is in dispute here.
None of the Government’s witnesses have testified to the effect that Bitcoin is inherently
illegitimate; indeed, both Special Agent DerYeghiayan and former Special Agent Yum
specifically testified, on direct, that using Bitcoins is not illegal in and of itself. (See Tr. 152:11-
13 (“Q. And to be clear, is there anything illegal in and of itself about using bitcoins? A. No,
there is not.”)). Bitcoin is relevant to the case only because it was the sole means of payment on
Silk Road and because it was used to launder illegal proceeds from the site. How Bitcoin may be
used in other contexts, or what uses it may have been originally conceived for, are simply not at
issue here. Moreover, allowing such testimony could confuse the jury into believing that
“Bitcoin” is somehow “on trial” in this case and that “expert” testimony concerning its
legitimacy somehow cuts against the defendant’s guilt. 
Also the following is what the defense wanted to ask Andreas about - doesn't really seem relevant to me. The only relevant part is the trace-ability of bitcoin but the prosecution already had a FBI agent testify that the bitcoins comming from the SilkRoad servers to Ross Ulbreichts laptop was direct transactions. They found that a small amount of bitcoins did not go directly but I guess they are willing to give up that small percentage if it really becomes an issue.

For bitcoin to work you really do not need to keep the full transaction history anywhere. The headers and the currently unspent inputs are enough. That being said there will obviously be nodes with full transaction history as well - but these need not be easy to run.

While that may be how it works I do not see how it is fair. What if new important evidence has come forth?
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:54:06
I can't offer any more proof than me telling you that it is the exchange I use. You should google it and make up your own mind. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:55:19
But the bitcoins are not in any way relevant. If the laptop is his (insert proof) and the incriminating information is not planted (insert proof) then he is guilty. The bitcoins are simply a part of the incriminating information that might or might not be his and thus there is no reason to confuse the jury with a detailed explanation of how bitcoin works. The bitcoins are simply a (less relevant?) subset of the incriminating information. Now the testimony of Steven Bellovin might be more relevant since this would in fact have been about the possibility of having the evidence planted.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:45:33
Having a good reputation might be relevant with credit cards since you can charge back but since that is impossible with bitcoin I really don't see a need for a reputation system. Businesses might want a reputation system but there is already a ton of sites with that kind of information and I don't see any need to limit such a site to bitcoin only (and why would one need the transaction data when sites like this already operate without it?).
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:13:36
I am assuming you did not enable saving mode in tails so the only place you have the seed is now the app. I have no idea what the app you are talking about does. Perhabs you can send the bitcoins from the app to a new wallet? If not you can probably retrieve the seed if you plug your phone into a computer and look around in the data for the app.

There are tons of systems for private communications. Help me understand where this is supposed to stand out; is the distinguishing feature that it is light weight AND p2p at the same time? How will you go about offline clients? Just wait for both to be online simultaneously or do you imagine the peers to carry the load until delivery?
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:50:05
Well. Instead of trying to force the community to pay him before we even know how this work why doesn't he work up a fix and then tell the community how much time he spent on it.

You are completely misunderstanding the issue at hand. You misunderstood having value with the price of the commodity
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:19:54
IANAL but I have read a lot of the court transcripts (man are they long). It seems like the court is very concerned about what is laid out before the jury as if the jury is very easily confused.
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:53:14
While IANAL I really doubt this can get an appeal.
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:21:58
Well that is just it. The judge also wrote a lot about how the defense did not provide enough information as to what the expert was going to say (which apparently is required).

Contrary to popular belief these matters are not actually being discussed and resolved on reddit. Take a look at the mailing list if you want to see actual information. For your information we have actually already working code for pruning the chain. See   I dont think it is included in any downloadable .exe file yet but that is comming, no worries. What it does is it deletes the oldest transaction data until you arrive at a max size you yourself have set f.x. 5 GB.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:53:07
In the start the bitcoin github was active because most of the coding was actually done there. Nowadays most of the coding is done elsewhere and only put into the bitcoin github when it is ready for peer-review. A whole lot of coding is being done and this month has perhaps been the the month in which the bitcoin core has changed the most in recent time. You are simply looking at the wrong metrics. Try looking at the mailing list - if that dries out one might want to get worried.

The computer has tons and tons of incriminating information. I don't believe anybody could ever argue that the bitcoins and the incriminating information on the laptop doesn't go together. So either Ross is responsible for the laptop or he is not responsible for the laptop. The bitcoins doesn't add anything new - the importance is whether Ross is DPR or not and this is not proved or disproved by the existence of bitcoins on the laptop. And as such the focus of the trial should not be on whether or not it is possible to receive bitcoins involuntarily - the focus should be on proving that Ross has been in charge of SilkRoad (from start to end).

Your premise was that the article must be wrong. If instead, you had asked for an easier to understand explanation, perhaps that is what you would have gotten. But the basics of it is that the bitcoin protocol allows spending inputs that evaluate to 'true'. You don't have to include a signature of an address. A more readily understandable example is that the address doesn't necessarily belong to the person that initiated a transaction

For this game to work you need to provide extra security so that it won't be swept by a bot. You took one hour to post this but it took a bot 6 seconds to sweep the address. You could f.x. say that the passphrase should be added to the end of some random address like so:

It seems that when we look at sites like  we are actually forgetting a lot of exchanges with huge volume.
Numbers from today:
okcoin.com: 45k btc
fxbtc.com: 19k btc
btctrade.com: 21k btc
huobi.com: 29k btc
chbtc.com: 40k btc
796.xom: 4k btc
We are actually overlooking 158,000 btc traded every day. That is actually more than bitcoinity's stated total(including btcchina) of 143,674 BTC. 
If this is true then Chinese markets have a total of 68.7% of the daily volume.
after looking at  i found that sites that default on chinse language make up 228k btc daily while sites that default to english language make up 72k btc.
In total the english sites make up 23.9% of total volume while Chinese have 76%.
