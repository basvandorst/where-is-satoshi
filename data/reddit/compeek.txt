That was such a stretch, but I upvoted anyway.

Sorry, wrong window.

I've never actually understood how tipping works, so if you're still going, I'd appreciate it!

Sorry for the late reply, but thank you very much! :)

I put a small sum in back when the price was about $13 and am still holding on to most of that.
Not too long after that I did some day trading back when Bitfloor was still a thing and got burned a bit when they shut down with only hours notice, so I got stuck with some in the $300-400 range, and the price subsequently crashed. I've been holding ever since for the long term and will continue to do so.
I've been thinking about investing some more with the current bubble, mostly for FOMO and the excitement of it all, so this morning I finally convinced myself to buy a bit more after missing the chance around $375 yesterday since I couldn't pull the trigger. I bought at $486 today and then it went back down to $375, so I'm kicking myself a bit for that, but oh well.
If it goes to $1,000+ again, I'll probably cash out the new investment for a quick turn around, but otherwise I'm still holding on for the long term.

Me too. I wrote a trading bot a week or so ago and have been seeing how it works, and now it's useless. :( Oh well. It pretty much just broke even each day anyway, haha.

I'm with you, man. I lost a 1 BTC gain during the crash because the site went down before I could buy back again, and then it was too late. Very frustrating.

I just had the same thing happen about 10 minutes ago, and still nothing. I placed a limit order to sell a number of Bitcoins, and the coins are on hold, but there is no order showing up. I imagine there is a backed up queue of orders or something since Bitfloor is clearly having lag issues today, too, so hopefully it shows up before long.

To add to that, if "everyone is buying," that means there is probably higher demand than supply--more people interested in buying at a certain price than people interested in selling at that price. Those buyers essentially buy up all of the coins sold at that price, and then the price rises because the next ask offers are at a higher price. The reverse happens when "everyone is selling". While it's hardly this simple in real life, in theory there is always a specific price at which supply and demand are equal, and that is the "correct" price at that time at which there will be equilibrium. When some event happens that cause more people to want in or out, the demand or supply changes accordingly, and the price adjusts to accommodate.
So, the OP is correct that somebody sells every time somebody buys, but the key point is the price at which those people want to buy or sell. There will always be people willing to buy or sell, but only at a certain price. If that price is lower or higher than the current price, then in order for trades to happen, they must happen at new prices.

Roman already made it clear that they are not going to convert to BTC for withdrawals. Think about it, though. They would have to dump all of that money into some other exchange in order to turn it into Bitcoins. They don't even have the money yet (until they get this check). I think they probably have enough to deal with right now. They don't want to have the hassle of making it any more complicated.

That's sound advice, but we're not robots, man. :P Being frustrated doesn't necessarily mean you're too emotionally involved.

I was in the middle of some trading to get back the 0.2 BTC I lost earlier today by selling too low, and then it stopped working. On the plus side, it stopped after I sold, and the price has gone down since, so I'm hoping it starts working in time for me to buy low again. @_@

I put 0.5 BTC in across about 10 loans about a week ago, and so far only one guy has repaid. Some payments are now overdue and others aren't, so I'm not sure how it will play out.

I can confirm. I already had an ING account, and I've used it twice now to transfer money to Bitfloor in the last month (only $100 each time). It worked perfectly, and there were no fees.
It's important to note that ING does a hard pull to your credit when you open a checking account, if that matters to you.

It's pretty much been like that since yesterday morning. I'm getting pretty aggravated by it as well, but Roman is doing his best.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:57:27
You have some good points, but "governmental oversight" is the last thing we want. We also don't need it. Clearly the whole Bitcoin situation is pretty shaky right now, and you're right that trading is confusing and somewhat reckless. But, over time, the free market with Bitcoins will mature enough (if it doesn't fall apart by then) to be more reliable. That's the whole experiment. :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:53:25
Yep, I still love Bitfloor, and I think it's probably the best exchange for anybody in the U. S., at least. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:31:34
Bitfloor is definitely less volatile within short intervals of time, and it'd almost always around 5% higher than the current price at Mt. Gox. I think it's mainly because the volume is much less. There aren't hundreds of traded every minute usually. On the plus side, the price tends to lag behind Mt. Gox., so if you're quick, you can take advantage that. It doesn't always work, but sometimes it's helpful.

I did not say it's an excuse to let your emotions take control of your decisions. I said being frustrated doesn't necessarily mean you're too emotionally involved.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:30:28
It seems pretty possible that many of those are just people holding long-term and not touching them, especially if they are in cold storage.

Roman replied to somebody's tweet saying he's working on this issue. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:47:45
Actually it will compute the Bitcoin amount when doing a sell order, but you have to tab out of the price field and then go back to it and backspace out the last digit and then put it back, and then suddenly it calculates the size field. You can actually make it calculate any of the three fields that way. For some reason, it just won't calculate until you unfocus one of the text boxes and then go back and change it. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:51:49
The answer you're going to get from most people here is that it's not too late because there is still tremendous potential, but as with any investment, don't put in more than you can afford to lose. And if you do get in, don't panic when the price drops. Keep holding on because the price will most likely go back up, and usually even the same day.

Sure thing! I accidentally discovered it once and am glad I did. I wish you didn't have to finagle it every time, though.
