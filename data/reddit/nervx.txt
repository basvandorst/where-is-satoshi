isnt there in the itunes store an option where you see all your downloaded apps on your apple account? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:24:54
you think in fiat not in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:03:09
For the moment in no way. When I think of the future of bitcoin most common transaction will be for example in a range of about 1000 satoshi up to 50000 satoshi.
If a laptop then switch between 35000 and 37500 satoshi is not such a big deal and people can live with it. 
Maybe I'm completly wrong in my thinking about this topic. 
How do you think about it? Would it be okay if prices change like this? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:32:34
I feel the same like you, but I think it needs time. When there is more money over all in Cryptos the prices will get more stable and even though the technologie needs to take the next step. For the moment its not able to see it as normal currency. For now just be happy that you already earned some coins and hodl them

Nash has a non custodial wallet solution. When you sign up for nash, the key generation event happens through seed words. With these seed words the private keys for all supported chains (Ethereum, Neo, Bitcoin) are created.
Based on zero knowledge proof nash will **NEVER** know anything about your private keys. All interaction where a private key is necessary (signing transactions) are processed on the client side.
Comparing nash to hardware wallets maybe come in mind because of the developments of a new key management system. More or less a private key give permission to make a transaction. I'm sure you have heard about encrypted keys + password (which is combined the private key) also can be used for signing transactions. Well and with further developments there are ways in encryption to do much more stuff. For example create a key that is only allowed to access 0,01 Bitcoin per day.

As far as I know it is based on threshold signatures. I'm not an expert in cryptography, I just scratched the surface. But the people who are working on nash are focusing on developing an product which is working entirely on a non custodial basis. My personal guess is that there will also be state channels involved with the whole concept.
Also from their background they I'm sure they can achieve what they are talking about. The founders are all from city of zion (main development group from neo blockchain) and have all a mentionable academic background. 
Most of the time they are publishing information about the technical side at the moment when they release the new achievement. Just give it a try and follow nashsocial on twitter. The plan is to deliver in late Q4 2019 or early Q1 2020.

Bitcoin itself? Never, doesn‘t go that fast with proof of work
Maybe with second layers: Lightning

No, in the blockchain you can still see that you transfered the coins from coinbase to your hardwallet as far as I know.
If Coinbase know your ID then the coins can still be connected to you. 
To get unknown get a new account on an other exchange and don't put in any private Information on this one. 
On your account, where you actually store your 
Coins, you change them to some private Coin (Monero, Dash). Then go and withdraw them to your new account on the other exchange.
When your coins are there you can exchange them to Bitcoin again and send them to your hardwarewallet. Thats the way to get an unknown Wallet where noone knows who is the owner.
If I'm wrong or there is an easier way feel free to correct me.

havn't said that..
Its just that we as humas have to learn to handle our privat stuff by use self and dont hope that there is someone in the back who cares for us. 
But I understand when you dont get my point, its part of a life philosphie
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:23:23
Thats the good thing. Your out of the government. I dont need someone looking at me and say: okay there you go this is stuff you can buy and this is not. This is to 100% my personal choice if i want to invest or not. 
Even though its also up to you to get informed about where you invest in. Because noone will tell you if its good or bad. Its just you and nobody else who decides what you do. When your stupid and invest in a scam, bad luck for you. This may happen one or two times then you should finally learnd your lessen, if not - then your too dumb for acting with money even in a system with regulations from the government.

BTC win
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:42:25
give it a try and scam back, maybe they are stupid too ;) 
make a fake account and say you wanna sell 10 BTC to them but for this amout of BTC you need their privat key cause of the network algorithm
if they have no clue they may give you their privat key
show them what they deserve

who prints the money? is there a limit? 
Bitcoin based on source code, 21 million
Fiat print by fed, no limit
centraliced vs decentraliced
why i need someone to trust? (banks) if i can trust the blockchain - total transparent
transfering money internationally is much cheaper and fast

there are a lot of different types or coins outside, some are here for currency, other have an utility, others are kind of security
Nearly every company will have a business model with a type of blockchain - if they sell a product they will do a token which represents the value of the product. And there are a lot of companies out there so there will be thousands of tokens. 
But some are Currency tokens others not. And there wont be the one token to rule them all. Im totally sure about that. You see how the last years worked out right? 10 years ago there was a Bitcoin dominance of nearly 100% and whats is it now? Right about 45%. This shows that there will be a distribution over more tokens and this way will continue.

Bitcoin is the 'leading' coin, it always makes the move befor the alts make the move
in december bitcoin gathered power from the altcoins to get the move upwards. In this time alts lose power and bitcoin dominance is rising.
After the ATH bitcoin goes down and stays at an certain level. At this moment bitcoin releases its power and pushing the alts up to their ATH in junuary. This leads to an decrease in the bitcoin dominance.
Now Bitcoin has taken a hugh hit and in this time the alts going to power the bitcoin, like they are saying 'hey bro you need help? we are there'. At this time bitcoin dominance is rising again. Now we are at a more or less stable point again and bitcoin says thanks and gives power back to the alts.

There is no need of one currency, its just needed that the currencies get connected together without loosing money on switching between. 
In my mind the cryptospace will have thousands of diffrent currencies in it. And it doesnt matter if you hold BTC, Eth, NEO, ... 
As example you hold BTC and want to buy something, but the other part only accept Ether.
Over algorithmen behind you can pay with your BTC and they will be changed to ETH and the pther one recieves ETH.
But you as owner of BTC wont recognize that this shift has happend. 
This prinzip will work over all token via cross chain exchanges with apis included in a paymentsystem. But this paymentsystem has to be accepted by both parts.
So there will not be one single blockchain to rule them all.
