All of us are dictating the price. Everyone buying or selling Bitcoin. 
These are all of the exchanges right now:

As volume and price increases.. the market price/value will stabilize more and more. 
The reason why fiat currencies are *relatively* stable compared to Bitcoin is because Forex markets see trillions in volume per day.

Bitcoin back to 4300 from the low of 2900 and its October 1 in China right now and trading volume keeps going up in China. Sounds like my 'weird' prediction isn't too far off. I also said *around* September 30, not *before* September 30. Reading comprehension. 
Also what's with the carefully designed ad-hominem attack? Trying to discredit me?

Yes he's smart. But you're assuming that he doesn't want Bitcoin to drop in price so that he acquires or hardens his own position. ;) He's very smart, he knows what he's doing, he's not wasting his time.

Bitcoiners are too smart to let go of their discounted coins. PBOC has cried wolf too many times unfortunately, they've been doing this since 2013. Ban bitcoin, accumulate, unban bitcoin, rinse and repeat. Most bitcoiners are cost-averaging on the way down and accumulating.

If a nation state secretly bought 5 billion USD worth of Bitcoin, they'd be one of the largest BTC holders and would be well positioned for the future. They would, instead, do everything in their power to destroy the fiat system instead to increase their geopolitical power.

Commence Chinese Government + PBOC insider trading and the purchasing of discounted coins. 
Around September 30, it will be announced that after careful consideration and interviewing/speaking with key players in the Bitcoin community/sphere in China, the Chinese government and PBOC have temporarily lifted the ban on Bitcoin trading until further evaluation. Shortly after, a massive short squeeze will follow and Bitcoin will push beyond 5000. 
Screencap this.

The fact that trading is still alive and active on Chinese exchanges and the "ban" was "pushed" to October 30 and that there is active volume on Chinese exchanges reaffirms my viewpoint.
I don't downvote or silence anyone, especially opposing viewpoints. I believe in free and open forums. You're entitled to your own opinions, but clearly you're attacks against me are fueled by your political viewpoints. :-)

Protip: Slowly accumulating by cost-averaging on the way down. Don't try to predict the low, it is impossible with a small/unpredictable market such as Bitcoin. There are simply far too many variables to account for.

This was also the lowest it dropped, at the time of writing this. BTCChina is trading at 20500 CNY.

And risk losing my coins when the price bounces back? No thanks, too risky.
Accumulate more by cost-averaging on the way down. :-)

The most important rule of thumb, never try to time the highs and low of any bull or bear rally and cost average.

Yes, people should hold their coins. But you are using that fact not to educate peoples on the importance of holding coins but instead to clearly further your agenda and spread FUD. 
Just look at your post, you titled it.. "The next crash.." 
I advise that you delete this post and re-attempt it by educating people rather than spreading FUD.

It is only volatile because the network effect is still in its infancy. 
The reason why the dollar is so stable is because all goods and services in the United States are bought in dollars, all wages are paid in dollars, all taxes are paid in dollars, etc. 
As an example, think about it like this.. let's say there is a tomato economy that only includes *you*. What is the price of tomatoes in your economy? One can argue that a tomato is worth anything that *you* decide its worth, after all.. the economy is built up of solely *you*. The price/value per tomato is extremely volatile. Suddenly another person comes to your economy and now the price must be negotiated between the two of you. The price becomes a bit more stable.. but still volatile. Add 10 more, and 100 more people, and 1000.. with each person added into the ecosystem, the price becomes more and more stable.  
Over time and as Bitcoin grows and becomes more and more widely accessible, accepted, and used; each bit will gain a stable/fixed value that is equivalent to the global goods and services that are produced. Bitcoin will become very stable, and quite possibly far more stable than any fiat currency was ever able to.

I also predicted a price. Bitcoin dropped to 16K Yuan and now is trading back at 26-28K Yuan.. thousands of BTC exchanged hands, I wonder where it all went and who was buying. As I said, around September 30. 
 &gt;Oh, sorry. Being that the deadline was today, I imagined your point to be that they'd be going back on their order to close all exchanges. The exchanges did close. But hey, I'm nothing if not patient. How much longer should I wait for the impending announcement?
If Chinese exchanges 'closed' **today**, then how come volume keeps rising on them? Explain that to me.


Oh, you're one of *those* people. I'm not interested in your virtue signaling and boo-hoo story. Here have some MAGA and shut up please.
