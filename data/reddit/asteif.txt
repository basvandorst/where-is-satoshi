U gotta back that statement up with facts dawg, why do you hate coinbase so much
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:18:23
My man, u think i ONLY bought at the top? Ive been in the game since 2013 �� nice try though 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:51:37
Binance is by far the best exchange. Highly recommend
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:11:15
OMG WHAT??? NOOOO SELL SELL SELL
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:52:13
Bitgroin is also taking a hit...to the groin....ill show myself out
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:51:01
GDAX has 0 fees in terms of withdrawing though
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:48:00
I will die by my HODL brothers before i even think of selling ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:38:02
Through Gdax? No fee. I say start by doing your research with Gdax
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:33:15
As of right now im keeping my btc in Gdax. Probably safer to store it in an actual wallet but in terms of fees, there are non if you limit buy/sell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:10:02
England is my city
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:20:04
I withdrew from GDAX to Blockchain wallet (mobile wallet) and they charged me :( it was only like 0.005 BTC just to test it out but they still did
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:51:27
Ltc going at approx the same rate as Btc
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:46:48
Easy HoDl then 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:44
Bought in at 19.4k, still holding on strong. We’re in this together bruh, just hold on. Ps i invested 4k, yes its scary, but i know itll bounce back up. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:10:05
Maybe it was the app but i transferred 0.005 into the blockchain mobile wallet and they charged me a fee. Not sure if its just how the app is but i kinda hate it now

Bought in at 19.4k, still holding strong
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:24:25
Can someone tell me how long i should expect my BTC in my electrum wallet after withdrawing from GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:54:47
Ez 21k, feeling good, hodl on
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:27:36
Watch more funds get into it now. Especially once the correction ends, because thats just profit there on up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:35:37
Now you’re just talking about any investment ever. Stocks, you know the classic NASDAQ stocks, are all predicated on speculation, speculation about the present and the past. Theres no other way. News about a guy who sold his bitcoins or about a guy who did something that affected something else blah blah blah isnt going to affect this so badly for it to crash to 0. Thats why yes, i speculate the obvious, that it will go back up. Im not a professional crypto analyst, but i can promise you they’d say something around those lines^
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:29
Mining bitcoin is literally impossible at this point unless you have really good equipment (high end GPU’s with a crap ton of fans) and yes, unlimited electricity. But even then, that shit will be hotter than the Sahara desert midday. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:50:33
Sorry kinda new to this but, cold wallet? Is that the same as a hardware wallet/USB?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:27:04
it will 100% crash but coinbase is just being a sore loser. Oh well, its a waiting game at this point
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:05:00
Best hardware wallet with 0 fees to transfer gdax bitcoins into?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:25:54
Trading isnt open, only sell/buy order book is 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:11:54
Anyone know how long it takes for btc to arrive in my electrum wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:16:47
Share some with me ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:44
You guys are just awful.
Lmao tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:54:43
I live by that. Preach
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:19:34
I 100% agree with this. Bitcoins history shows a rise of approx 40% within the next couple of weeks. For you hodlers out there, i pray you stay strong. You weak fucks can go die and give us your bitcoins (or stop being weak and hodl like a man)
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:10:31
I also dont know if ill die tomorrow, doesnt mean ill just stand there with my thumb up my ass �� its an investment i feel passionate and positive about, oh well 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:50:21
Obviously no one ever truly knows. But based on the past dips of bitcoin, this is no different. People will tell you “because of this it will crash and die” or “well, this country just put a ban, selling everything”. If theres demand and people like me out there, the price will bounce back (and i can assure you that there are people out there just like me). Purely based on speculation, but that speculation is based on facts about bitcoins technology and history
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:37:53
Lets not get cocky....it really only bounced back today. Im on your side cuz i bought in at 19.4k but lets not jinx it
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:20:16
Ez hodl
