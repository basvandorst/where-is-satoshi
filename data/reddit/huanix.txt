I'm not referring to banning the miner from mining on the blockchain, I'm referring to the miners who would take their hashes elsewhere to a trusted pool. It's not "socially impossible" unless a majority of pool contributors are hell bent on the destruction of the network.
The rollback would consist of proprogating a chain longer than that of the attacker, as described by [gavin in his post regarding the 51% attack](

It's not really about him, its about the people who don't know any better. Imagine if someone called your grandmother to do a "survey" asking how much money she has hidden in her mattress.

Can someone explain a little more about what bitcoin core is as opposed to bitcoind? 
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:07:48
The cases do exist. The schildebach android wallet used a weak prng a few years ago and some coins were lost, but this is the wild exception rather than the rule.

Though you acknowledge that you understand the risk is next to 0, you proceed to suggest that it's a legitimate risk. It's not. 
[Here's a numerical discussion of the risk of collision](
Given your example of 1 billion users at 10 addresses each:
There are 2^160 or about 1,460,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible addresses
In your scenario, 1,000,000,000 people are using 10 addresses each for a total of 10,000,000,000 possible addresses
10,000,000,000 / 2^160 should yield the probability of a collision occurring
10,000,000,000 / 2^160 = 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000684
So the chances of a collision occurring in your scenario are approximately 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000684%


No. This would require the blockchain to identify the owner as such. It's not a function we would want to implement in the blockchain.

You got it. I generally use direct quotes (like this demonstration) to identify the exact phrase I'm responding to. There's this odd concept (at least in English) where we don't assume that words convey a complete thought, so it's okay to quote someone's words, but you cannot claim to know what someone is actually thinking. (Even though it's clear that thoughts and words are correlated.)
@_date: 2014-09-13 23:54:31


That is true, but it would be immediately evident in the blockchain if they abused this trust. It would require a rollback of the transactions (which is no small feat), and the pool would be banned for eternity. I agree that it's not a good scenario, but it's also not a dealbreaker.

I felt like this graphic is a bit disingenuous:
It takes about the *ONLY* bad snapshot of the bitcoin exchange value that you can find.

I really feel like I would understand your premise better if you presented it as a Venn diagram.

Is there any chance you would be willing to modify the css to increase the prominence of the article titles, both in size and color? I enjoy the aggregate view, but it is a little difficult to focus on the headlines.

I'm still a believer. While I do wish I could have been in the very first wave of ASIC miners, I'm also in this for the long haul.

I posted a suggestion at bitcointalk for the admin to encourage him to fix those issues.

I have to disagree with you - bots can significantly change the value of the bitcoin market. I don't understand many of the potential scenarios for this, but a simple scenario would be a (broken?) bot that sold several thousand btc - the market effect would be panic and people would buy or sell based on the behavior of the bot - which would ultimately affect the value of the currencty.

As someone with quite a bit of my bitcoin tied up in BFL for _nearly_ a year, I'm tired of hearing about it. I would be satisfied if I didn't hear another thing from BFL until the postman rings my doorbell.

No one can predict the future. It's a risky investment for sure. Many people believe you'll do better in the long run by buying bitcoin at today's market price.
@_date: 2013-10-03 23:22:44
Its an illusion. Difficulty is rising about 25% every 10 days right now. No one knows for sure if these miners will even pay for themselves. If they do pay for themselves they're not going to make you rich.

Western Union? Honestly, if your friend doesn't want to be involved with bitcoin, pressuring him isn't going to be a good solution.
