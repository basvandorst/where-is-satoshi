I mean, if you sold at the 13k mark and then just reinvested all if it back in at like 10.5k, you did make more money. Unless taxes are shittier than I give credit

How can you say that? Sure there are a lot of messed up things happening, but I know that, because of my government, some person or persons can’t just come take my shit for example. I sure as shit am not gonna go fix the roads I need to get me into work, nor work/organize/police all the other conveniences of modern society. Of course I’m not trying to ignore all the fucked up stuff governments are responsible for, but, at least imo, but at least they stand between where we are now and the total anarchy that could (and usually does) result in a bunch of humans looking out for their own best interests w/o consequence.

Thanks for the very educated response! It was my understanding that a lot of the public works projects are simply funded by the government and contracted to private companies, so by removing govt we’d be theoretically getting rid of the middle man. I think the benefits of govt in these situations, however, are the ability to organize and have unity of action. Each private company would have their own way if doing things, some better and some worse for sure, and for things like energy, wifi, ect. this competition would cause increased quality and decreased price. But with a country-wide distribution system, I just dont put enough faith in the private sector to efficiency and sensibly do these projects while maintaining the interests of the general public. 
Which leads to my main reservation: regulation. The goal of a private company is to be profitable. This more often than not is done by taking shortcuts. Even with regulations things are still going to shit, the medical community is a big example. If there were no governing body, who would regulate projects with global consequences?

Okay, so there’d just be a company like Regulations R Us with a trustworthy public opinion, which charges for an audit-like process for a stamp on their product, in theory? 
For global projects I guess I could be referring to two things: 
One would be  large scale societal issues, such as violently incompatible belief systems or making sure food was widely available, or general paternalistic things which prevent mass casualty. IE some crazy extremist organization going unchecked. This is an issue that govt only sort of tackles and also hinders, so I guess this may be a moot point. 
The other would be for things like CERN for example, or the ISS in orbit. CERN especially has/had potential for global impact, but the cooperation of the international community on the side of governments acting with their citizens’ best interest made sure that everyone’s concerns were adequately addressed before they moved forward. Im having a hard time imagining a private regulatory agency that isn’t governmental which would be able to wield the authority needed to effectively mitigate risks. 
Again I appreciate the conversation and discussion!

Just for fun... 
Isnt water cohesive (self-bonding/sticking) as well as adhesive (bonds/sticks to others)? 
And since that doesn’t really matter, can ice get wet?

Wow thanks for the fast and comprehensive reply! 
Would you mind elaborating on why connecting to Ledgers nodes is an issue? Sorry, I’m working to build a complete knowledge of BTC but there are TONS of “unknown unknowns” Im trying to fill in haha... What sort of thing do I have to look out for with Ledger’s nodes? 
Will definitely be looking to setting up my own node, as that sounds to be the best option. Would it have to be a full blockchain node or could it be something like an SPV node?
Again thanks for your time and for sharing your knowledge!

Exactly. The notification to update was from a phishing attack though... 




This is where I fell for the phishing, which presented me with the false update link in-app, which automatically downloaded. Just a lapse in attention for a tiny instant was all it took to mess up something Ive done many, many times over:/

Great response, I really got nothin else! If you’ve secured your coins properly they CANNOT take them without permission huh... pretty freaking sweet. Thanks for explaining it that way for me boss!
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:31:08
If they (I assume we’re talking the government legally seizing the possession) connect your address to your ID, can’t it be taken like any other thing? When the Silk Road went down they definitely confiscated a shitload of coin. Was that just from what was on the exchange? 
If you can keep your coins anonymously then yea they’re essentially 100% secure. Im not saying its likely, just that it definitely isn’t out of the realm of possibilities

This... just having legal tender in any amount shouldn’t be suspicious, nor should you get “reported” in any sense of the word trying to conduct a legal transaction.
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:53:54
Literally any of that can be taken away from you... whats your point?
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:51:10
Well the fees for using BTC vs CC might be something, and as another poster pointed out the quicker access to the payments (avoid CC processing). This means you could give a price break on BTC to slightly encourage business from BTC users. 
This being said Im not sure what the whole process entails in setting up lightning payments. It could be more work than its worth. Its a really cool idea though! Hope to see more mass adoption on the future.

Noob question: would gold/commoditization go up if fiat is in trouble? Is there any sort of correlation between the two markets (commodities value and fiat values)?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:59:21
So a paper wallet vs a hardware wallet for HODL is much preferred is the gist? I don't really trade but intend to use it as a currency (steam accepts BTC now, so I'm just waiting now:D)
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:15:42
Wonderful, thanks for the insight!

I was more thinking of what happens when the govt. decides the coins are either profit from something illegal (and intent crimes do exist). 
Before I start I do agree that it’s basically as hard as taking money from an offshores account. That being said... shit the US Marshal Service are one of the biggest sellers of BTC today, and they’re selling confiscated coins. Some of the numbers I read from a quick search were the US govt has confiscated almost like 2.5% of the entire circulating supply.

While I personally agree with this sentiment, until the masses are shown that BTC is stable, and honestly until it legitimately is stable, BTC could make ya poor real quick... *if one isnt careful.*
Its still just too new for an average, not super tech savvy person to safely store their earnings in. Im not even just talking about the price fluctuation either, which is accounted for by HODLing, but the fact that its still relatively easy for an individual to get hacked. 
The way the financial market is headed, though, seems like a good thing towards proving the long term worth and safety of BTC for store of value!

edit: thanks for entertaining my opinion, fellow internet stranger! 
Well, the EUR and USD at least are still riding that “too big to fail” wave while it lasts. So currently yea, Id say they’re more stable if for no other reason than they’re backed by large entities, who have a lot at stake in keeping normal fiat usable for the masses. 
This isn’t to say it isn’t changing, just that the current perception sorta dictates reality to an extent and the currency perception of the masses is that BTC is less stable than “gold-standard” fiats, for lack of better words. 
As things stand, I think it’s practically impossible for a 0-value BTC these days, which average people fear. However, until something severe heavily shakes the peoples’ faith in fiat, its still going to be the dominant currency. We’re seeing that already in Venezuela where people are dumping fiat like fire for more stable crypto (its all perspective) because their own currency is becoming unusable. For those with somewhat functional fiat this pressure isn’t there, cause my 20 can still get me basically the same as it could a year ago.
