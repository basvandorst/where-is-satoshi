Fuck it. I quit my job this summer to be a ski bum this winter. I highly recommend it. 
I also have most of my assets in GBTC (401k cannot buy bitcoin directly, next best thing)

For those who think that there is no issue with the government... and we don’t need bitcoin... go buy a gallon of gas for $1... or buy a new car for $100... or a new house for $10,000.
If you’re having trouble buying these goods at these prices (which were common in the past) it’s because every Government on the planet continuously prints more money... which makes everything cost more over time. 
We know this as “inflation” and most just accept that prices go up over time. 
When no government controls a monetary supply, we all win. 
Bitcoin for the win.

Ahhh... slow learners... I hope that your wages go up more slowly than most as prices go up �� then when you retire and you’re on a fixed income, I REALLY hope that prices increase more and more quickly, my friend ��

I love bitcoin, own bitcoin, and I find it very interesting… This dude blabbering for 20 minutes is not interesting. 
@_date: 2019-12-28 02:58:22
Sorry for being so negative… Maybe it just needs to be edited down more?
I love bitcoin and the freedom that it brings. I would love to support a bitcoin. 
If you edit this into five minutes... golden. Just sayin

Good thing we drained the swamp... to fill it with turds. 
We need bitcoin because we can’t trust the douche sticks.

Yes. Banks do not print money.
The FED prints money. Take a tour of the nearest US Mint, where money is printed. 
When banks loan money, they are borrowing money from people and paying minuscule interest. The banks charge interest on loans (charging many, many times what they pay in interest). 
This is how banks make money. They do not print money. 
If this doesn’t help you, google is your friend ����

Trust is bitcoins greatest asset. People would rather put their trust in a huge network of strangers than any one company or CEO. 
Anyone who cannot understand the value in that cannot understand the value of bitcoin.

Banks do not print money. You should change it to the FED

If 1% of the other assets move into bitcoin... the value of bitcoin would jump almost 30x... from $7k to almost $200k per bitcoin. 
Since these numbers are inflated, cut it in half for $100,000 per coin. I’d be happy with that.

Like when you bought at $20k and didn’t watch the price for a year... then it was $3.5k?
I’m on your side... but you’re wayyyy oversimplifying extreme volatility that comes with this growth
