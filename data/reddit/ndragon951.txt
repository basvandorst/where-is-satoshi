Bitcoin is divisible but the way it is sent back and forth isn't so much.  People mention cash, but I think checks work better, esp when banks allowed 3rd party checks.  
I have a check for for $20, you need $5.  I sign that $20 check to you, you sign a $15 check to me.  Then you buy anything but a stupid coffee with that $20 check, the seller writes you a check for the difference.  1 input 2 outputs in each case.  
The amount of the checks can be defined as anything, can write it that I pay you $20 and you pay me $00.01 if I bought a $19.99, its still 1 input and 2 outputs, same fee. 
A problem shows up when you get $0.01 back many times, say you went on a late-night As Seen on TV binge and spent $19.50 and got $00.50 back on 10 difference transactions.  You have $5 now, but when you try to spend it your wallet has to use TEN inputs instead of just 1.  Roughly 10x the space.
If miner's fees didn't exist and block size were infinite, this would rarely matter.  Each block can only include so many transactions at a time, and its the miners who get to decide which transactions go in their solved block.  You can think of a block as all the people a bank could see in a period of time to cash checks out.
How do they decide?  They look at how big your transaction is(In bytes, not $) compared to all the other transactions out there.  Rationally, they fill the block with the transactions that have the highest fee per byte attached...fees get attached by purposefully overpaying, miners pocket the difference.  Its a lot like waving money at the teller while in the bank's line to get to skip ahead.

Now we're chewing thru the 50sat block.  I'm not alleging a bad actor here but I'm still curious, why do we have such trouble getting into a layer but once we get a toehold it goes down fast?  Almost a week ago we had trouble getting into the 100sat section, but once we did it managed only a short recovery before it was gone.  The 70 sat layer fell FAST.  The 50 sat layer is half gone already.  But each time we hovered above that layer...  Why is that?
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:02:54
*puts on tinfoil hat*  OR, seeing that the tx spamming and price fixing by Them has resulted in unexpectedly hard push for LN instead of abandoning BTC, the strategy is switching to NOT spam BTC, letting fees return to normal, and therefor removing the incentive for LN adoption and bringing BTC more in line functionally to altcoins.
Has the genie made it far enough out of the lamp, yet?

If you don't backup the private keys or keyphrase, yes.  However, its arguable safest to use your wallet's node from a security and privacy point of view, since your wallet would never have to ask any other node for any information that other nodes might use to guess which addresses belong to you, nor could they provide any false data since you already have the data.

People bought it in the beginning the same way they do now, the find someone with it and offer something in exchange.  The first Bitcoin nodes their own wallets, mining software, and blockchain data in one, so the data would be stored locally, think Bittorrent or Napster or other peer to peer file sharing.  The blockchain was tiny in the beginning so the whole download would take only a few moments and would be working in concert on your computer.
With the Genesis block, 50 BTC were created(might be wrong here!), assuming the normal rate of 144 blocks a day 7200 BTC would have been created, your $3000 would not be able to buy more than what existed, 41 cents per coin would have bought the entire supply, 375k BTC didn't exist yet to buy.
The mining award is created from nothing when the block is mined, and is the only way new BTC are added to the network.  Each machine watches all other machines and only accepts mined blocks as valid if they follow all the rules, there is no central decision maker.  You're free to mine your own block and transmit it to the network, and if its is valid in the eyes of the individually owned machines on the network, your mining reward is honored...the network only recognizes blocks with very very difficult solutions currently, so you'd have to spend a LOT of electricity to find one.  
Also--To join the network you need no permission, just download the software and sync up to become not only another pair of eyes watching everyone else, noone else can lie to you about the BTC already out there(Since you'll have your own copy to consulte like you would if your bank would let you directly look at their master ledger) and noone else can know what addresses belong to you(since you never have to ask another node about specific balances so the cannot even guess)

Both forks have a temp solution.  Bitcoin Cash upped the block size, giving 8x the transactions, while Bitcoin rolled out Segwit, which gives 4x the transactions and possible future layers.  Bcash was a mandatory upgrade, "Mine 8mb blocks or go mine Bitcoin", while Segwit is an optional one that the biggest transaction generators are just not choosing as an option.  People need to make their choice soon instead of sitting back and hoping the crowd chooses Bitcoin Cash or Segwit for them...that kind of behavior is not helping us.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:48:18
Thank you, moving to Bitstamp now.  Coinbase worked for me but its really kinda critical to get Segwit going.

Heh, I've a 1.5kb transaction in the mempool now.  I'm only offering 50 sat/byte for it, willing to wait days for it to clear since its just a consolidation of mining payouts to my cold wallet...stinks.
And yeah, Segwit by itself isn't going to cut it more than short term, and I expect companies to act rationally so Bitcoin Cash is likely to gain serious ground in the next few months unless things REALLY get moving with LN.  Like months ago fast.  I can just hope, but if Bitcon fails, I'll take my loss and points my miners at Bcash pools and start fresh, the market will have spoken. :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:00:09
Cleaning up both of my replies here, 4x was definitely the wrong figure for me to have used and I retract that statement.  We've even less time to get something like LN going than I suggested before people are forced to use Bitcoin Cash due to block congestion even with full adoption...

I think the hashed scripts are stored outside the block in a datastructure similar to how UTXO are stored?  A single SHA256 output is fewer bytes than the original script, esp if the script was multisig.  If I hadn't been up for 20hrs maybe I'd understand and convey a bit better, going to sleep in a few.   Still, I think the main trick of Segwit isn't 100% data size savings, I think by moving the witness data outside the blockchain they're able to link it with outside data structures to build a second layer for scaling.  
I googled the ISDN of the book, 978-1-491-95438-6, and found Google scans of it, Appendix D: Segregated Witness.  I've a physical copy of the book, I just prefer paper, cost me about $35.  Either way, its a very fun read if a bit programmer-heavy at times, its pushed me from "completely uninformed" to "knows just enough to really screw things up" on my understanding and explanations. :D  Goodnight!
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:35:28
Gah, IKR?  What confuses me, I'm looking at a [mempool tracker]( here and...sheesh.  I don't understand it rationally, both confirmed and unconfirmed transactions get rarer as the fee size increases, as expected, but starting at 991 sat/byte there are a _HUGE_ number of them.  They don't rationally fit what I expect to see, maybe BTC Billionares making sure their 5$ coffee goes thru in 10 minutes even if they have to pay a $50 fee for it?  Its not economical and since we're trying to make this economic situation work its an out-of-context problem. :\  16919 transactions with a total fee of at least 0.101 BTC or more.  USD$142?  2.4 million total in FEEs.  Thats what I'm hoping LN helps with, can get instant transactions without having to pay a king's ransom for something that is supposed to be the internet of cash...
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:56:49
Statement is retracted in part, its not a simple 4x.  On page 343 of "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopoulos, two example transactions are given and one of them does show a significant decrease in bytesize but it is wrong of me to suggest that ALL transactions would decrease similarly.  Transaction A would go from 857 bytes to 271 bytes, a 68ish percent decrease.  B would only go from 633 to 402 tho, 39ish percent smaller.  Neither is 4x and I will be more careful with such statements in the future, thank you! :)

Definitely going to be used, here.  Is there a reason why Bitcoinpaperwallet(.)com's template is greyscale?
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:48:15
Transaction A is said to be a complex one, 3 inputs and 2 outputs, but gives no details.  It gets more difficulty to understand and explain since Segwit is a soft fork, so it must operate within existing consensus rules, not a hard fork that requires changing the rules(as block size increase did for Bitcoin Cash).  Add in that I've only been getting deeper into this in the last five months...
From what I understand, the Witness part(unlock script) of a standard transaction is removed from the transaction, leaving it blank.  Blank doesn't violate node consensus rules.  The witness, or unlocking script(which can be complex, and has one for every transaction input) is then hashed and put in an outside data structure that does not have to be included in the block, it can be referenced by the UTXO when the outputs are spent.  For transactions with many inputs, the removal of the inline witness script reduces the size of the transaction.  Instead of storing the entire unlocking script, which there is no reason each script can't be "pathologically large", a hash of the script is stored.  To spend the output, a segwit wallet just has to match the hash of the script instead of the script itself.  
So block date is reduced by not having inline unlock scripts for each transaction, and total data is reduced by storing just the hash of the unlock script.  Its certainly and totally not a 4x improvement.
If I understand right, of course, I wouldn't give myself more than a "C" on the subject right now.  C+ if I graded for enthusiasm.
Once I get more BTC and time I'm going to grind off some identical dust in my segwit and non-segwit wallets and compare what the TX bytes are sending to each other or to themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:09:23
Bitcoin Cash blocksize and lower usage means they do not have a need for it right now...so no immediate need for segwit or the extra layers and all the development issues.  It's Bitcoin that really needs to get this rolling large scale...

If someone steals your PC and you have that password set, they'd have to guess the password to decrypt the wallet to extract the private key, which they could use to find all your funds and move them to their own wallets.  So use a strong password.

Like raising the US Debt ceiling, its only a temporary solution.  It works currently for Bitcoin Cash, but as more people and more transactions happen, it just ends up with the same problem Bitcoin is facing right now.
Segwit's first-order change allows about 4x as many transactions per 1mb block by moving the bulkier part of transactions out of the block.  That change, by itself, is also short sighted, it'll hit the same problem Bcash will hit in a while.  
Segwit's second-order change is the important one, long-term.  It builds the structures that our 2nd layer solutions like Lightning Network require to operate.  LN allows people to make secure transactions off-chain, only having to hit the main blockchain to buy in and cash out.
Bitcoin Cash will need to implement something like Segwit to build it's own Lightning Network, but since their users rejected Segwit in favor of a block size increase I don't see that happening soon...they've time to wait, tho, more time than Bitcoin can wait with Segwit until LN goes live.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:15:09
I think it would for people like me...these numbers are not perfect but:  BTC without segwit is pretty much capped out at 1mb per 10 minutes, for the 4.4GB/month.  I've my full Bitcoin node on a 500gb HDD...to maintain my node, I'm going to have to spend my money and buy a larger HDD in about 50 months.  Thats acceptable to me, despite there being no fiat or BTC incentive for me to run this thing.  I believe the individual decentralization the blockchains grant us all is reward enough.
BCH's blocks are not near full, so right now its unfair to say they take up 8x the room.  But say they do, BCH replaces BTC in the near future and everyone switches, the blocks fill for the same reason as they do now, its popular, everyone is in on it now, the fees go up, etc.  For me, that 500gb HDD is now full in 6 months instead of 50 months.  That is a much harder sell for me to run an independent node with the full ledger, I might decide to drop out.  People in similar boats to me would likely as well, reducing the number of nodes and decreasing decentralization.
So back to BTC.  Add in Segwit, block size stays at 1mb for my 50 months, but transactions process 4x faster.  Thats great, but eventually even the Segwit data is filled, fees go back up...and with only half the time BCH has to find a scaling solution.  We're running into the same problem no matter the fork we work with.
Except Segwit doesn't just trick the system into being 4x faster, it tricks the system with means to build transactions outside the blockchain altogether.  Each transaction on the blockchains right now is similar to writing a check, then having to spend 10 minutes at the bank to have the check's amount validated, only to find a huge line of people already there unless you brige/skip the line with extra fees.  Transactions off-blockchain would be like getting a cashier's check, then passing signed personal checks between people at need, only going back to the bank when someone has a stacked and summed series of signed personal checks they need to cash out to another cashier's check. 
One of the methods, the Lightning Network, has most of my interest because people who run LN nodes can potentially be compensated for running those nodes, getting a few Satoshies for every LN transaction or personal check they route along.  Its not a lot, but its REALLY appealing for my node to offset it's electrical and electronics costs a little, and it keeps the blockchain from needing expansion for a MUCH longer time.  Thats the future I'm hoping for, regardless of its BTC or BCH or ETH or even BTG that does it first.

Both equal-height blocks are saved resulting in two short chains.  The next block to be solved will have to build on either of the saved competing blocks...it is rarely logical for a miner to start a fresh 3rd chain rather than pick one of the two to work on.  A miner can pick whatever block he chooses to build on.  Once that block is solved, one of the short chains will be longer than the other, that chain will be considered the the main chain to follow.  There are few situations where a miner would continue to work on the block that is already 1 behind, almost all of the time the miners will want to work on the longest chain.  Not going for the longest chain increases the chance a block they solved ultimately won't be part of the longest chain, resulting in lost work.
This is one of the primary reasons to wait until 6 confirmations, 1 confirmation might end up on a chain that ends up not being the longest, delaying the tx until included in a later block.
@_date: 2018-10-24 23:57:51

No blockchain-only cryptocurrency will manage that combination without basically becoming the private-ledger trusted 3rd party that banks currently are due to the required block size and frequency completely swamping any decentralized network's bandwidth.

I'll have to think on that.  Address reuse reduces privacy, but if you're transacting with one person I guess privacy is already gone.  The other issues I'm much more hazy on, but for every transaction the private key P is multiplied(?) by a random value K(currently seeded by hashing the tx to ensure every different TX has a different value K).  If two different transactions using the same private key are ever known to be multiplied by the same value K, then its possible to derive the private key of the sender.  There have been several P derived by 3rd parties this way, mostly by whitehats that I know of.  Any future use of that address is now compromised.  Quantum computers would make short work of finding a private key even with 2 properly random K's, but if they only ever have 1 tx its much harder.  I'm unsure if a signed private message and a signed transaction would count as 2 and open the address to quantum attacks.
@_date: 2018-06-18 02:30:02
Offhand, say 250 bytes per transaction.  10 billion transactions would be 2500000000000 or 2.5 trillion bytes per day.  104,167 million bytes per hour or 28.94 million bytes per second.  You can get a good internet connection to handle that.
But that is just for one node one way with block data, you seem to be asking in reference to some banker saying Bitcoin adoption would crash the internet, so lets toss the net at this.  Say 10,000 nodes distributed around the world,   Now you need 289,400 million bytes per second assuming the nodes were smart about updating each other so each node only downloads each unique block once from each other.
289.4 billion bytes per second, that IS a lot.  It'd take less than 24 seconds to fill my entire HDD.  But...and this one is harder since the internet is so distributed its hard to find the overall Tx rate...the internet seems to be going at  58,179 billion bytes per second right now.  Blockchain traffic would amount to 0.497%...less than one half of one percent...of the entire net.
Double it even to account for the Txs being sent to the Bitcoin network to be added to blocks.  STILL a bit less than 1%.  Double it again if you want to argue not every Tx is going to be 250 bytes, 2%.  
tl:dr The net won't even notice 10b transactions a day.

Currently the Lightning network is similar, the payee provides the invoice to the payor and that invoice can't execute if the payee can't confirm receipt.
On-chain, its possible(to varying degrees) for the payee to typo the receiving address and your funds go to address he cannot access.  Legally the payor would have some leg to stand on if the payee refused to give you the good/service after the transaction, its the payor's responsibility to provide the correct address, and if the payor complied exactly then they have right to the goods.
On the technical side of things, I think the payee could use the private key for that specific receiving address to sign and return a message from you, proving they have access.  In a custodial wallet situation, tho...well, thats one reason custodials are not good.

No, no effect.  When your withdraw transaction is broadcast by that website to the network, all the bitcoin nodes will update their chain to include the transaction.  When you connect with Electrum later, it'll update with the servers and see your transaction in the blockchain and keep tabs on it in your software.
@_date: 2018-06-03 15:17:53
Your wallet sends the tx to the network, which forward it all to each other to store in everyone's individual mempool.  The shopkeep will see that within seconds to at most a few minutes.
A miner solves a block in which they included your transaction, one block solved approx every 10 minutes.  The shopkeep now sees 1 confirmation, but 1 confirmation is just a good start.  Still, 0-10 minutes is a good bit of time for a busy shopkeep.
Once in a block, every solved block past the first will be another confirmation.  At 6 confirmation, there is almost zero chance of the tx being changed or removed from the blockchain.  An hour is definitely too long to wait for the shopkeep to allow you to leave with the product.
So it breaks down to how much risk the shopkeep is willing to accept and trust you.  If you're buying a cup of coffee, he might accept zero confirmations, just seeing the broadcast TX is probably enough so he can get to the next customer, low risk of loss of funds vs loss of business by making the line wait.  This stage is easiest to cheat because so must trust is required.  Its also closest to a check/cheque for the shopkeep, who might suffer a NSF charge if the customer's account doesn't cover it later.
One confirmation is a lot more trustable, probably more appropriate for a pizza delivery, some groceries, monthly subscription payment, etc.  Way too much time to wait.  Probably more similar to a credit tx, where is pretty sure to go thru, but might get challenged by the customer later and reversed by the credit company.
Six confirmation is about an hour.  Your'e talking buying more expensive stuff like cars and houses from the shopkeep now, that tx is almost certainly going to be a permanent entry into the blockchain.  Nobody is going to wait an hour for a cup of coffee.  At this point, its almost as like you'd handed the shopkeep cash.  Except cash can be counterfeit, but a tx cannot be counterfeit and make it six confirmations deep...
100 confirmations is what miners have to wait for to spend their mining reward.  You're buying planets at this point.  
You're right, it does take a lotta time.  Way too much time if we want to be a real currency.  We need almost instant and fully trustable transactions, from coffee to Mars, in a way blockchains and their slow heartbeat can't match.  Hence that Lightning Network thing.

You could do that, but the proof of work requirements would mean you would requiring a staggeringly huge amount of hash power to redo all those blocks while remaining within consensus rules.  I honestly don't even know how to calculate it.
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:58:38
Basic economics, people with high costs per hash will rationally drop out of the market.  This reduces the overall hashrate, which results in a negative difficulty adjustment, which makes it easier to mine, resulting in increased profit for the remaining miners.
As an aside, I'm not sure renewable power could turn it into a non-issue.  If you have a marginal cost of literally zero cents per kWh, you still have to consider opportunity cost.  Choosing between running your miner a few hours during a sunny day vs charging your Tesla for a few hours during a sunny day has some cost to you...

No(A transaction can be signed offline with the private key, moved across an airgap to an internet computer, then broadcast, preventing the private key from ever coming into contact with the Net) and
Yes(To elaborate, when you spend you're just announcing to the network "Hey, I'm sending XYZ 1BTC, using my balance on ABC, and to prove I own ABC I've signed the transaction."  XYZ doesn't even have to exist yet...and if noone can prove they own XYZ with a signature, the money is lost.  XYZ doesn't have to do anything, but everyone now knows XYZ has one bitcoin, and that balance can only move if someone steps up with a valid signature proving they own XYZ.)
You could avoid letting the Net know of the public key(in the form of a BTC address) but then noone would know it to send to it.

The coin the signed transaction refers to would be sent completely separate of the 1 BTC coming in:
* Address A with 1 BTC on block height 200, signed as Tx 1.
* Incoming Tx 2 deposits 1 BTC on Address A on block height 201.
* Tx 1 is broadcast, moving 0.5 BTC to recipent and 0.5 to your change address B on block height 202.
You end up with:
* 0.0 BTC on Address A on block 200
* 1.0 BTC on Address A on block 201
* 0.5 BTC on Address B on block 202
Even if you get multiple BTC going to one address on the same block heigh, the signatures will be different and won't be confused, but I think any more complex than this I'm not qualified to explain.

I think you can generate your own word list, one compatible with the Trezor's list, then 'restore' it into the device.  I'm gonna play with my Trezor T for a moment to see.
One thought while I was working on this, don't put all your coin in 1 device from 1 manufacturer.  Split between Cold storage, hardware wallets, and different software hot wallets on different platforms so you have some coin available to spend without exposing your cold storage very often at all.  Anyway:
So I verified my backup first, of course, then I wiped the Trezor T.  Then I restored using a 12 word list I'd used for an unrelated software wallet, finished setup, then aimed Electrum at the hardware wallet.  It pulled up the correct transaction history for the wallet I'd taken the seed phrase from.  
From that 1 data point, it looks like you can toss your dice to generate the entropy, convert that to a seed phrase compliant with one of the BIPs, then 'restore' that seed into the device so you have a private master key that is pretty much assured to be unique and private.  That is quite a leap, but its possible.
And btw, I'm envious you got in early, I didn't start mining until 2017, but I'm proud of my single coin.  :D

Lightning network already supports sub-satoshi amounts.  If were were already connected, you could pay 0.001 satoshi.  If consensus is reached that the blockchain needs to support sub-satoshis, then everyone would just upgrade their nodes to support the change then you could spend 0.5 sat on-chain.

I use Electrum on my pc and phone for 'hot' storage, easy access.  For long term, I've a Trezor T.  Well, my phone has a few diff wallets now due to different features I like but I trust Electrum most.

That was a Lightning network tip of 1000 satoshis.  Each bitcoin is 100,000,000 satoshis, so that was about 9 cents US at time of writing.  It took about 4 seconds to get to the Tipbot's wallet and cost 1 satoshi in fees.  Bitcoin is definitely awesome, the Lightning network builds on that.  Its a lot more reading to get a good grasp on it, but I figure it'll be a good next step if you ever find the normal Bitcoin network boring. :D
@_date: 2019-02-16 13:02:15
Electrum leans their security model slightly more toward convenience.  Trezor is leaning more toward security.  Two different approaches to the problem of making sure the user can actually spend their bitcoin(internet-connected hotwallet type) and making sure the user's bitcoin can't be stolen(airgapped cold storage).

Went almost 9 hours with a block.  Then it went another over 10 hours before a 2nd was hit.  If you left over that, you missed out on hitting 10 blocks in the next 5hr41m.  And don't forget starting around the 20th Slush had an incredible run of luck, I was almost cheering.
If you're mining, you're in it for the long run, and in the long run the math works out in a predictable fashion.  But if you can't stomach the occasional 12hrs without a block payout, which is understandable, there are reputable pools out there that pay you per share work instead of only when blocks are found.  But the same math will work against you as those pools often charge a slightly higher fee.  Either is a valid choice, but try not to complain about the math of the choice you've made when another choice would suit you better. :)

They really don't get stuck, the miners just have more transactions with better fees per byte than yours and can only fit so many transactions per block.  It'll go thru when your transaction makes sense to put in their block, either when they're done with the higher ones or you bump the fee up with RBF(Replaced by Fee) or CPFP(Child Pays for Parent, where someone wanting to spend from the TX they're getting attaches a high enough fee to their unconfirmed tx to cover yours as well)

You seem to wonder if its possible that a block might end up not having a solution at all just the Nonce, which is the appended number you refer to is called?  Its a 32 bit number, or only about 4.3 billion.  Its actually common for there to not be a solution within just the nonce, but miners can change many variables in the block beside the nonce.  Coinbase addresses, coinbase signature, timestamp, order of transactions, number or no transactions, more than enough variables that its pretty unlikely to ever find a block that cannot be solved by any combination of the above.
@_date: 2019-02-11 03:59:51
Scaling is expanding usage here.  More ppl and more transactions, we have to find new ways for the system to keep up. The three main things being looked at is using the block space better, securely moving transactions off the blockchain, and increasing block size.

Once you have a full node running, you could download and setup BFGMiner.  With that, you could theoretically get a USB ASIC and that software, point it at BFGMiner, which points to your node, and mine.  I run a full node on a fairly decent but otherwise unused gaming rig, BFGMiner(Been able to successfully connect to it even over the internet), and a Gekkoscience 2pac running at 32gh/s.  Its definitely an education on several levels, and I consider it kinda knowledge ppl need if we ever get to go back to smaller and more numerous mining pools.

This is a bit more advanced advice, but depending on how long you've had that Bitcoin those addresses may have altcoin values.  I have very limited experience with it but was able to recover about $20 worth of Bitcoin Gold from one of my older addresses, despite never having mined for or been paid in it.  Basically anytime someone has hardforked away from Bitcoin all the prior coins were duplicated in the new fork, some of those forks some people will actually pay for those coins.  I'd advise researching those forks, how to safety recover the funds(usually you do this AFTER moving the Bitcoin to a new address to prevent accidentally sending the most valuable stuff to somewhere you cannot recover).  That is what I'd immediately liquidate into USD and have fun with.

I've gotten 3 people set up with BTC wallets.  I really need to develop 3 tiers of explanation, here.  
Explaining bitcoin to people without the technical knowledge to understand transactions("Here, bitcoin from my wallet to your new wallet.  At six confirmations, no force on the planet is going to take that from, you without your private key, which is on that paper you just wrote the words down on and in your phone.  Do not lose either."  
One level for people who can understand a bit of the math but don't understand the ledger("Yes, you could write a program to authenticate the intention to transfer a value between public keys, but can you write one that gets written into an immutable public ledger proving that transation that happens to be 9+ years deep?"
One level for people who can understand the math but misunderstand the difficulty of some math in reverse or don't really get the philosophy of money even if they get all the math. ("Sure, you could mine your own block, but unless that block's hash starts with 18 zeros, you fail to prove you did enough work fast enough to earn it, and it'll get rejected.  Provide an 18 zero hash in that 10 minute window of a valid block and yes, you'll get 12.5 bitcoin.  You'll also spend many many thousands in the attempt, causing you to value the 12.5 BTC at least as much as your power and equipment cost, the value of the BTC didn't materialize from nothing."
I'm not nearly the wordsmith I'd need to be to explain all this on my own, and there is no explaining anything to a closed mind, but I try.  I think thats the best way I can help, just get people out there set up with wallets and give them about USD$10 of BTC, show them how to send BTC as well.  The first time some business offers to take payment in Bitcoin from them, it'll be Very Real in a way I can't provide in a quick conversation.  
@_date: 2018-11-24 04:07:53
There is no seed for a single private address, really. Wallets use a master seed to generate the same series of private keys based on that original seed.  That original seed is what the recovery words describe to the the wallet.
Now, if you generated a wallet with a seed, then used the first address generated, I guess you could maybe count that as a recovery words, but not exactly the same.
@_date: 2018-11-19 04:45:20
I'll have to read more on that.  IIRC, you'd need to create a valid script that hashes to a matching digest, and you'd have no nonce to work with unlike when trying to solve a block.  On top of that, the entire transaction is signed with the private key, changing the script would mean the signature would no longer be valid, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:51:40
It is depraious.
@_date: 2018-11-18 22:32:53
Breaking SHA256 wouldn't recover the original value, the information is mathematically lost in the process.  What breaking SHA256 would do is allow someone to create a matching hash digest, which would circumvent the proof of work aspect Bitcoin uses.  Like you'd be able to immediately find a nonce that generates a sufficiently difficult result to solve the block.  Bitcoin would have to move to a different algorithm at that point, SHA3 or better.
What means the information is lost?  Super simple example, x mod 7.  Mod means return the remainder of the division, so 100 mod 7 would return 2.  If you knew I'd gotten 2 after Mod 7, you can't know if I'd used 9, 51, 100, 107, or any of the infinitely many things that mod to return a 2.  SHA256 has a LOT of mods and other one way things going on, you can literally never be sure what they started with, given just the digest.

It can be calculated but you'll find an actual measure to be different.

Some good examples of how the recovery works already, boils down to wallets know what to do when given a phrase internally, they don't have to go ask Trezor or anyone for a backup, etc.  
-Will add that since the phrase is generated according to an open standard, you don't have to restore your wallet on a Trezor directly, you can take that same phrase and put it on a software wallet to recover and have nothing to do with the hardware wallet again.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:11:00
So your TX gets confirmed on block X.  But then another miner at about the same also finds a block Y, but doesn't have your transaction in it.  Now part of the network is working on X, one is on Y.  If the next block is found on Y, most miners will start working on Y+1, abandoning X.  The transactions included in X return to the mempool to be mined on Y+2 or later.  Eventually your TX gets included somewhere, which is why we go for more than just 1 TX confirmation.  When your TX is X+5(6 confirmations), is when you're almost certain to not see it unconfirm.
Edit, nvm, I was thinking orphan blocks, not the altcoin war going on Over There.

First confirmation took 30 minutes?  Its frustrating to see it take that long.  Look up the Lightning network on how BTC is scaling in ways blocksize and blocktime can't match, I don't have a lot of time ATM to explain in detail but I've been playing with it and payments have settled in seconds once setup.
Want something more frustrating, real quick, tho?  If every person and bank involved in a basic check transaction waits for full confirmation(In the US at least), you're looking at 3-5 _business days_.  You write  a check to the store and they're having to trust the check will eventually be good or trust a 3rd party to vouch for you(Chex Systems I think)?  The trustless aspect of BTC balances the speed ATM.

SSH into the node.  "lncli getinfo" will list some info about your node, including the identy_pubkey and uris.  If you have autopilot and funds on, the node will eventually try to automatically open channels to other nodes.."lncli pendingchannels" to see which are opening or closing.

Given enough time, it does not matter, the pool fees and how they pay matters much more.  Lets assume all pool fees are the same, and the total network is at 100,000 Th/s(which is MUCH lower than BTC current, but its a math thing).  You have three pools, 50000 th/s, 5000 th/s, and 100 th/s, and your miner is 14th/s.  
*The largest pool can be expected to get 50% the blocks per day, and your 14th is only 0.028% the pool.  
Together, you can expect to get 0.014% of the daily network mining total.  
*The middle pool is only going to get 5% the blocks, but since you're getting a bigger cut at 0.28% of the pool, you get...0.014%.  
*Smallest pool is only going to get 0.1% the blocks per day, but your cut of that pool is 14%, which works out to 0.014% again.

D'oh.  I was actually concerned earlier today, I'd just shown someone how to set up a wallet and gave them $10 worth of BTC, only to not see the transaction confirm by the end of my conversation.  Saw the recent mempool and went "crap, this again JUST as I feel safe to start showing ppl again"   It cleared about 4hrs later, they're happy for it, and now with the zoom you suggested I'm not worried.

What recent woes?  Article is behind a paywall, so I can't read it.  Lightning is maturing on mainnet.  Hacker attacks on an exchange were stopped cold.  The mempool is clear and I'm again able to show people wallets and give small amounts of coin.
The recent woe of the heavily overspeculated price of last December not suddenly going back up?  Late-comer get-rich-quick people not having their retirement money come in yet?  
What are the woes?  I see the situation continuing to improve, the price may or may not follow those improvements...

Yeah, that part isn't so hot lately.  I try to console myself by remembering that the huge pools usually have thousands of individual miners working together...even if thats not 100% how it works.  Also, don't forget the non-mining nodes.  Mining nodes have to conform to the rules of all nodes or their solved blocks don't get transmitted, and those non-mining nodes are hugely cheaper to set up and are quite widely distributed.  Without them transactions wouldn't make it to the mining nodes nearly so easily, and the less well connected a mining node is the more likely their solved block might get orphaned.

If you mine, try getting larger payouts less often.  If you buy or trade, then you're going to accumulate lots of small inputs, usually called Dust.  Switch to using a Segwit wallet(addresses usually start with 3 or bc1) so when you do send lots of small inputs the cost ends up being lower...you might send lots of small inputs to yourself with a low fee, if you don't mind it taking a few days to clear, just so you'll have a nice solid single input for when you do a real transaction.
Going forward, Schnorr(spelling?) signatures will making having many small inputs much less of an issue.  Lightning network should allow many many transactions with only a few inputs used to open a channel.

Big miners have lots of overhead.  They've got to pay power, wages, salaries, rent, insurance, etc.  AT some point, they HAVE to shut down.  I'm a tiny miner, all I have to pay is electricity.

For  there are transaction fees.  It is not a tax, it works more like a processing fee and goes to the miner that finds a block that he included your transaction in.  As for taxes, it is safer to assume that since Bitcoin is a money the government taxes should be the same as spending dollars.  Not paying legally required taxes is tax fraud and governments tend to frown on that.

Sorry to hear about your loss.
Not much advice here but the bare essentials.
Unhook that PC from the internet until you know what to do.
Do not send anyone anything about the coins or files at all.  If someone is explaining anything, any examples shall come from them, it is too easy for a bad actor to ask "what does x look like" and a naive user give their full private key unkowningly.
That is enough BTC for it to be worth educating yourself to at least fully knowledgeable before you touch anything.  Understand older BTC coins have copies in the hardforks.
There are more knowledgeable people than me here on the rest of what to do.  Bitcoin is built on trusting noone and with the right knowledge you will not have to trust anyone to know what to do.

Well, I think the point is with a credit card, it is not your own money.  Your $1000 limit credit card is just an agreement with the bank that you'll pay them back for using their money at the store.  They're going to have some say over how you spend their money, thats just fine.
Now, debit, check, money transfer, anything that draw on funds that I have legal right to?  Block it and I end my relationship with your bank.  Fortunately I have a credit union that doesn't give two satoshis what I do so long as my payments are on time.

For A, even if that centralized entity is benevolent they will represent a single point of failure for the system.  CEOs and companies and small groups can change out pretty fast, and even if they don't they're a huge target for bad actors.  Look at the cryptocurrency exchanges and services that have been hacked in the recent year, each one held the trust of many people and had rational reasons to maintain that trust but failed.  Maybe its inevitable, if the target is juicy enough people WILL find a way thru, but if that same target is spread among 51% of the population and each bit will require significant hacking ability, then its no longer worth the effort.  Even if no hacking involved, try convincing 51 of 100 people to 100% agree to a single place to go eat that'll harm the 49 others.  I'm guessing it'll be significantly harder than convincing one CEO to do something that'll benefit the 'majority' of his customers at the cost of the other 49%.  This applies to elections as well, and laws.  
As for B, it relates to A...what entity do you trust to decide if a transaction was fraudulent or not?  Even now people are being shut down by banks that object to their customers using their own legal funds to buy cryptocurrencies, citing high potential for fraud.  Who keeps said entity from declaring transactions with porn sites as also potential for fraud?  Subscriptions to news sites?  Scientific sites?  There is a group out there for each that would love to shut the transactions off on 'moral' grounds.  The only solution, really, is to trust NOONE.  A transaction is valid is the owner's keys are used, end of story.  Fraud is going to happen, as you say...its just human nature.  The will always be some social cost of keeping people educated to fraud.  I personally believe there is more to distrust from centralized banks than there is from the random conman.

Time?  Thats the most popular answer?  And waiting.  Well, there is a more people buying than selling thing. 
Not saying people intend to just passively wait, but while waiting you could instead spread the word a little IRL, dispel FUD, explain that mining doesn't mean parsing stolen personal data, etc, show how wallets work, give some tips on how to avoid the scammers that are surely polishing their technique.  Ask them what money really is when they say BTC isn't money.  Point out Arizona will start allowing taxes to be paid in BTC.  Lots to do!
But please don't just wait if that is what you intended.

Trying to explain it really tests my learning, so I'm happy to try where I can.
Not sure if responsible is the correct word, but it definitely a service they proved...they could just as easily refuse to provide it barring a court order, but they rationalize providing the service results in greater long-term profit than not providing it.  Its an insurance, really...you buy with a Visa, and the seller cheats you, Visa can return your money out of their own pocket and then go after the seller to recoup their loss.  If lucky, they'll get the money back and also charge the fraudster for even more and at least break even.  If unlucky...well, they recoup nothing but still break even by charging a high enough transaction fee.  Which is where society bears the cost.
Seller side fraud...I just don't see that cost-sharing service existing as we know it.  A defrauded buyer will simply lose his BTC and have to resort to legal means such as small claims court to attempt to get the courts to coerce cooperation from the seller or just accept the loss and move on.  I think it will be expected that BTC buyers do their due diligence when buying from a seller they don't know yet, same as we expect BTC owners to protect their private keys.  It sucks when either of those are not adhered to.  Its just a downside to having a system where we're not trusting a 3rd to make things right for us or to get permission to spend our funds from.  Its a different set of risks compared to fiat, it'll be really interesting to see how it all plays out in the coming years.

It isn't being used for scientific purposes, nor are miners processing personal information.  All miners are doing is building a prospective bitcoin block, then running a SHA256 hash on it.  If the hash result starts with enough zeros, the miners broadcasts the "solved" block and gets the block reward.
I think the requirement is something like 18 leading zeros right now.  It gets longer if the blocks solve faster than 10 minutes each and vice versa.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:44:53
Pretty much nail on the head for A, yes.  Set up a system where everyone acting rationally in that system keeps the system going, then the more people that join in the stronger and more stable it gets.
I personally wouldn't describe most of the groups that would halt certain types of transactions as 'malevolent'.  A fundamentalist church would act in a way they see as benevolent when judging transactions and might block scientific research subscriptions on the grounds that they might believe that research to be a fraud at best and dangerous at worst.  There simply are too many different ways to judging from too many different value systems to have a worldwide electronic currency that bases the legitimacy of a transactions off anything but simple mathematical proof.
As for fraud...there is a cost when fraud occurs, but there is also a cost to ensure fraud does not occur.  For fiat, consider checks before the online checking system went live.  The store knew there was a chance the check you wrote them could be hot, but also knew it didn't happen often enough to insist on every customer paying cash, or to insist on calling the bank to verify the check might be good on every transaction.  They would lose honest customers just from the processing time...that would be part of the cost of ensuring fraud doesn't occur, which business willingly bore since they felt the actual cost of real fraud was lower.
Bitcoin has a similar function, not often used.  You could create a multisignature transaction where both the seller and the buyer AND a mutually agreed escrow agent would have to sign to verify...but as the agent would probably want something for his time, there would be a cost there too.  A good capitalist is going to look at ALL of these factors in his business dealings and make rational decisions where they apply.

Rationally, you might wait another day to buy food, since you'll get more, but at some point the value you put in eating today will exceed the price of what bitcoin will buy you tomorrow and you'll buy to avoid starving.  Economically, this is pretty efficient, you're not going to buy more than your share since that causes you to lose out.  This buying what you need is something personal financial advisers are always trying to get people to do.
Compare to fiat money, your money will have less value tomorrow, so it automatically makes sense to buy the food today.  Even if you don't need it, you'll won't be able to buy as much tomorrow, so why lose out?  This causes overconsumption, people buying more than they need or even can use the time.  This causes goods to become scarcer quicker, their prices to rise, and people more apt to overconsume even more, causing economic problems.
Now, most of the time, assuming the value of the money stays fairly constant, its not gonna matter much day to day.  Bitcoin still goes up and down a lot day to day, but since starting it is on average way up...it remains to be seen how far up or down or sideways it'll go.  With enough usage, prices will stabilize, and no matter where they stabilize at we'll be able to denominate it appropriately.
Fiat, tho...it only ever goes down.  Given enough time, it goes down to zero.  Dozens of times in history people have ended up wallpapering their house with fiat since it held so little value.  You can't denominate almost-zero paper value money effectively.

You can only send unspent transaction outputs that the network knows of and you have signed with the private key.  If you guess the number of a bitcoin, which is one of the looser definition of solving a block, then a coinbase transaction would be created on an address you've provided, which would be spendable 100 blocks later and accepted by the network.
When I say 'network', I mean the consensus of every individually operated bitcoin node.  You would have to individually trick the majority of all the nodes to get your transaction into a block, then you'd have to again trick them all again for the block to get included.  It is _far_ easier to legitimately mine a block than to accomplish that feat.

It isn't, the ECDSA used to generate the public keys and sign transactions is closer to encryption, but since Bitcoin's purpose isn't the secure transmission of textual messages(which some ppl STILL manage to do) then comparing it to such systems isn't so useful.  It just repurposes a few of the same tools and we lack a more accurate and concise term.

Stress testing theories is always good!  Maybe food does have the wrong connotation, I should have said goods.  Ideally, a currency that keeps its same value over all time would be best, it'd remove the incentive to save or spend based on future value and simplify things.  If the money suppliers for fiat were careful to match the amount of money printed with the actual increase in economic value at that time, we'd had less need for things like bitcoin.  Unfortunately, governments usually run heavy debts, and its just too tempting for governments that print their own money to just keep printing more to pay those debts instead of printing to just match economic value.  Some administrations might be good about it, but eventually someone in charge will print a $17 trillion dollar bill, pay off all the debts, and smash the value per dollar to almost nothing.  The only real solution is to trust noone with that, put the decision making in pure mathematical decision making system, then distribute the mathematics over far too many people to easily change the system.  Time will tell!

Yes, it is.  Its also a bad idea for a few reasons, assuming you care more about the security of your coin than the convenience of rarely misplacing a finger.
Basing a unique private key on a fingerprint makes it lots( &lt;-- append absurdly many repetitions of the phrase " and lots " here) easier for a bad actor to find your private key.  You literally leave copies of the key anytime you touch most surfaces.
A quick google search estimates 2^74 probable unique fingerprints.  I feel that might be a high-end guess.  There are 2^160 possible private bitcoin keys with rip-160.  Thats 77 trillion trillion keys per fingerprint.  That destroys the security model.
Also consider, fingerprints are not immutable.  If you suffered damage to your fingerprints(burns, cuts, etc), that would change how a scanner would read it, and derive a different private key.  You'd lose access to your funds.  So you would need an immutable backup, and the best types of backups are so much more secure than your fingerprint that its best to just use them directly...
So, fun idea, but I think if I ever own a bitcoin I'll use a cryptologically secure random number to derive the address from. :)

With enough personal information about you, they could even fake an in-person meeting.  More secure companies than them have fallen victim to phishing, spear phishing, and even whaling operations.
Keep your funds on an address you have the private key for, keep that private key safe and secure, and no amount of social engineering will risk your funds.

Bitcoin transactions are a little weird.  The Input is an Unspent TX Output(UTXO) you'd received to that wallet in the past.  You can't spend just part of a UTXO,  you must use the entire thing when you do.  If that UTXO is more coin than you want to send, your wallet creates a new UTXO to an address you already control in that wallet for the difference.  If its less UTXO than you want to send, your wallet will try to find an additional full UTXO to use.
In this case, it looks like you sent 53.43 mBTC to 19qi but had to use a UTXO of at lease 67.94 mBTC so the difference of 1.45 went to 3QT9.  Approximately 0.067 mBTC went to the miner's fee, the bribe you float as incentive for a miner to include your transaction.
Fun fact, 10 separate transactions to 1 address counts as 10 UTXOs.  You'll pay a lot more in fees to move them vs a single transaction on the blockchain. :)

How well do you understand the supporting tech(Ellipitic curve keys, digital signatures, Byzantine General's problem, proof of work, etc) for Bitcoin and the cases for using it(decentralization, censorship-resistance, security (semi)anonymity, etc)?.  
Its a lot to read and study...someone mentioned that getting a good understanding of Bitcoin is similar to a semester of a college course.  Lots of people have faith that driving the technology forward will bring the price up, and lots of innovation is happening on the LN.  People attempting to drive the price up directly arn't really adding much to Bitcoin's value on the medium-long term...I think the huge runup last quarter of 2017 was driven mostly by short-timers driving the price, which I don't believe will hold a candle to what the medium-long tech-drivers will bring it to in the next five years.

In general, anything advanced enough, like strong AI or Quantum computers, would be so disruptive to the entire datasphere that your Bitcoin would not be high on your priority list anymore.

There are programs like VanityGen that can generate millions of private keys per seconds.  Lets be very generous and say a high powered PC with GPU would do 100 million per second.  What you're wanting to do is generate a private key that produces a public key known to have a balance. We'll ignore you'd have to compare that result with the utxo pool every time. There appear to be about 75 million unspent transaction outputs, lets be generous again and say that all 75 million are unique addresses with a balance.  More data points are the maximum possible number of addresses(Lets take 60^24 quoted by gonzales82 up there) and if you're trying to store the private keys against future balances being sent to addresses you previously found.
Ok, 75 million addresses against 60^24 possible.  Each random attempt would have a 0.000000000000000000000000000000001583% chance of finding an in-use address.  You're trying 100m times a second, and since the scales are so hugely different, lets go for how many times a century you can try, about 3.14x10^17 attempts.  You could calculate all possible private keys in 1.51x10^25 centuries, 50% chance to find any one particular address in about 7.53x10^24 centuries.  But wait, you don't need a single one, you need one of the 75 million possibles, so 75m times more likely.  My math is getting really shaky here, but that only appears to bump you up to 1x10^17 centuries to find one of the 75m.  Thats 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 years, 10 million trillion.  For a 50% chance.  As for storing the private/public keys?  Lets be generous again and assume 512 bytes on the margin to store, you'll need to store 47.7Gb/second.  My 6TB HDD would fill in a bit over 2 minutes.  You'd end up needing more HDD in mass than the solar system to store all the pairs, by many orders of magnitude.  Not going to even go into the power requirements of any of this.
tldr;  You can generate lots, but there are lots^lots^lots^lots so its better to just mine or buy.
ps; Excel sucks with big numbers, I didn't feel like freehanding or using a science calc for this, and its late, but I'm pretty sure the math is much closer to good than it is close to being possible to brute force a key.  This was fun.

Its possible a 2nd miner came up with a different valid solution to the same block your transaction was confirmed in, but does not contain your transaction.  A malicious miner might intentionally mine on top of that new block, preventing your transactions even after you thought it confirmed.  
By waiting for 6 confirmations, your transaction is now buried that many layers deep.  Redoing the chain to remove or reverse it is effectively either impossible or far too expensive to attempt.  Every new block adds more security to the prior confirmations.

The invalid transactions would die as soon as they entered the honest network and would not propagate into it.  After receiving a few invalid transactions from a bad node, the honest node will simply blacklist it and not take any more transactions.  Honest nodes will also not send out invalid transactions.  The bad nodes would quickly find themselves cut off from the honest nodes and only able to send their invalid transactions among themselves.

I've mined various altcoins on my PC and I mine BTC on some S9's.  If you're really dead set on earning some BTC, look into Nicehash since they payout in BTC in exchange for mining altcoins on your GPU.  But the way the market is right now, learning how Bitcoin wallets work and selling stuff in exchange for it or buying it outright will probably be the best way to get it.

As someone who now has a raspberry lightning node going, the more the merrier!  
I'm eagerly awaiting the first payment to relay thru mine that isn't my own transactions.  Lightning Stickers on the way and an Android cable for my trezor.  Third relay any day now.. :P

Hugely, yes.  But thats less of a challenge, getting all this working on a Pi has been really...educational. :)

I've a raspberry pi 3+ arriving tomorrow.  My goal this weekend is to get a full node(copied from my hobby computer) going, set up Lightning, sell the hobby computer I currently have my node running on(Its a bona fide midlevel gaming PC on it's own) for Bitcoin, use half the funds to open Lightning channels.  And probably almost assuredly keeping an eye on the prices.
So I'm almost an adopter?  :D

Verify you've got ports 8333(BitCoin) and 9735(Lightning) forwarding to the device network IP on the router?  Also usual stuff like bitcoind is fully up to date and LND has the block headers scanned?

Not a clue at all at this point, I've a ton of reading and research to do first.  I've a 3 day weekend and only anticipate getting things on track by the end of it.  Its gonna be fun. :D

I've a Pi 3+ B...or is it a B+ 3?  Anyway, it can have an interface like that, it runs bitcoin-qt just fine, but I have bitcond and lnd running on it atm, as well as cgminer for my gekkoscience 2pac for the ultra long-shot block solve.  But it does get a little laggy with too many GUIs...

Good move to want to get that off a site, your keys your coin.
Depends on your tech skill and what equipment you have access to, offline computers or the like, the best answer is going to depend on what you are comfortable with.  The most technically correct and secure answers are well beyond my ability to follow safety, for example.  I'd mess it up and make it unsecure trying to go for perfectly secure.
