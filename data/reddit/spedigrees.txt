I'd like to think he was wrong, but he was no dummy so he's probably right.  Most people don't want to be their own bank - witness the massive numbers of people storing their BTC on exchanges.  Autonomy doesn't matter to them.  
However it won't prevent me from being one of those rare individuals who transacts Bitcoin based purchases, so there is that.  I'm not in a majority now and I probably won't be then.

You clearly have no realistic idea of life in the rural United States.  (When we were young and lived in Boston, we did not own a car or need one, but few people live in inner cities these days.)  Riding a bicycle here 20 miles to work would be laughable, especially given that we often have more than a foot of snow and temps in the sub-zero range F - think -32 degrees Celsius - and our highways are not designed for cycling traffic.

Thanks for the reminder.  I just deleted my account as well.  
CB was my entry point into Bitcoin also, and for awhile I was happy buying BTC from them and sending it to my wallet.  Then they began asking for a scanned photo ID after 8 months of doing business with them.  When I refused they wouldn't let me sign in to my account, so I was unable even to close my account with them.  
I tried again tonight after being reminded by your post, and for the first time in several weeks was able to get in without being dunned for a scan of my drivers license.  I  hesitated for a brief moment, wondering if I should take advantage of the situation to make a final last buy of BTC, but was afraid the demand screen would appear again, so I just summarily deleted my account. 
It is a relief.  I was increasingly upset with them for having all my credit card information while effectively barring me from signing in even to close my account with them.

Racism in the south was being addressed; now we have a prison industry searching for more blacks to lock up and a military police force being trained to abuse, kill, and arrest them.  In the early 70's I had many black co-workers thanks to affirmative action.  Now they would probably be sitting in prison, and if not, there are few jobs, and none that pay a living wage.  So yeah, things are a lot worse today for blacks than they were in the 70's at least.

The only thing that would cause a child to be picked on would be the parents of other children conveying to their offspring that it is acceptable or expected to tease another child because of an unconventional name, or any other difference from the status quo.  Children raised in a home where diversity is valued and respected do not tease other children.
I went to school with a girl named Pall Mall.  She was popular, sociable, and never "given a hard time" by anyone that I ever witnessed.
While I would never name a child after money or a brand of cigarettes, I find it sad that some people cannot think outside the box and want to give their child a unique and original name.  It would be a boring world if everyone thought as you do.
BTW the USA does have a prohibition against giving a child a clearly derogatory name.  You could not name your offspring "Stupid Idiot" or "Shit-For-Brains" for instance.

We had LIFE magazine's bigger than life color photographs depicting civil rights violations, lynchings, etc in the south.  We had books written that painted a graphic picture - "Black Like Me" was required high school reading in the 60's.  Newpapers reported fact-based stories and were required to print opposing views.  Because there was not the noise of the internet and cell phones, these media sources had a greater impact than the drivel that passes as news today.

Compliance with FDIC regulations is required for any exchange that holds fiat for its customers.  Coinbase is not unique in this respect.
You are very much mistaken about Coinbase's insurance on crypto.  That insurance is essentially employee liability insurance.  If the exchange is hacked, and it is not the fault of negligence of CB's employee(s), you have lost your crypto.  This is precisely why there are so many warnings on this sub and others about the dangers of storing crypto on an exchange.  Look up Mt Gox.  Coinbase is the next Mt Gox just waiting to happen.

Send $200 to your Grandma and the $9 fee doesn't seem so significant.  FYI the value of Bitcoin at the time you placed your order is what you pay, and checkout is instantaneous as soon as your BTC hits the sellers wallet.  Most trx take less than 6 hrs to accumulate 6 confirmations, and your merchandise is typically shipped out the next day, no later than a credit card order.  Sounds like you haven't sent much bitcoin to your Grandma or paid for any online orders with bitcoin.

Reagan began the downfall of fairness in this country and it was finished by Clinton, Bush, and Obama.  The Vietnam war was a travesty, but there was a political will to end it, and the memory of it kept us out of war for many decades.  JFK's Peace Corps was an alternative for many who were opposed to war.  Today's endless wars for oil are just that - endless.  Civil Rights was in the works.  Woman's rights issues gained massive ground.  There were jobs aplenty, and affirmative action helped many to get good jobs that they had previously been denied.  The income gap was minuscule and one could afford to buy a home and raise a family on a single minimum wage job.  Union jobs that paid higher wages were plentiful.  In 1969 I was able to put a roof over my head and food on the table in a large city working at unskilled clerical jobs with only a high school education.  Corporations that grew too large and became monopolies were broken up to give competitors a chance.  There was a free press and impartial reporting of the news.  Two investigative reporters brought a president to justice for wrong-doing.  
Fat chance of that happening today.  Assange is the only newsman publishing the truth and he is holed up in an embassy living probably on borrowed time.  The only way that you could consider this era to be fairer than that is that you weren't there and have no idea what life was like in this country in that previous time.  I have watched the decline and seen us devolve from a nation with a high standard of living for the bulk of its citizens and a world leader in science, education, and medicine to a police state with more citizens in prison than any other country and the rest struggling to make ends meet.

Confirmation times when buying online with bitcoin are irrelevant because a tx seldom takes more than a few hours to confirm and almost never more than a day.  If you paid with a credit card, your purchase from Overstock would not be shipped out any faster.  I have purchased by both methods and the wait to receive an item is no faster with the one than the other.  The fees are worth it to me for the autonomy that Bitcoin offers.  I have bought many items from Overstock (a kitchen cabinet, bathmats, handmade jewelry, dog toys, and more) and paid with bitcoin - no complaints about the process.

Yes, and if you were to alter a Susan B Anthony dollar coin by engraving $3 on it and convince a convenience store clerk to accept it as a $3 coin, you would probably be guilty of counterfeiting, and definitely guilty of fraud.

The blockchain is just a ledger.  Bitcoin is the innovation; a ledger is not revolutionary.
Edited to add this:
"You can't just cleave off the blockchain technology and say 'This is revolutionary' because it's not.  Blockchain on its own is not revolutionary.  Why am I saying that the blockchain is not revolutionary?  Because the blockchain is a ledger.  How old are ledgers?  Thousands of years old. In fact the very first writing that we have discovered around the world, on tablets, on stone, on papyrus are ledgers."

To safeguard your bitcoin, get a secure wallet that allows you to control the private keys and move your bitcoin there.  If $50 is a lot of $$ for you, then a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger is proabably out of your price range.  Read about paper wallets:

Store the private key to your paper wallet(s) in two secure off-line physical locations.
If a paper wallet is not your choice, at least download a software wallet like electrum and store your seed words and password in the same secure manner.  An online wallet belonging to an exchange is the least secure place to store your bitcoin.
I would also recommend that you watch some youtube videos by Andreas Antonopoulos.  He explains what Bitcoin is and how it works in a way that quality reddit posts and other written material simply can't. 
Good luck to you.  If Bitcoin continues to increase in value, that paper wallet of yours could end up being a very profitable investment for you.

If this was a single guy cashing out, the entire sum would have gone to a single address in an exchange.  Look at the final transaction.  Smallish amounts of bitcoin were sent to many Bitcoin addresses all at once, bundled into a single transaction, most likely belonging to individual customers buying bitcoin, and probably the one larger amount sent to another address belonging to the exchange who made this transaction.   Business as usual at Coinbase (or some other exchange).

Cash = no fee, quicker, *more convenient* than either a cc or btc. 
Then there is the safety issue with a credit card.  All your personal information is attached to that card and every time you use it you are exposing yourself to identity theft.  You make a bitcoin purchase and somehow get scammed (not so likely if you know what you are doing), you lose the bitcoin involved in that purchase, and that is all.  I can afford to lose $35 or $135 worth of bitcoin, but I can't afford the expense and stress of identity theft.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:47:22
From what I understand, it depends on the type of machine.  Some only sell BTC for cash while others will take BTC for cash.  Some you scan in your public address and the BTC is sent there, while others print out a paper wallet containing the BTC you've purchased.  Most require a photo ID for large purchases, while most do not for purchases under $50.
This is all second hand info from others who've used BTC ATM's.  The nearest one to me is 4 hours away.  I hope to check it out this summer.

No, you can alter a dollar coin and mint some of your own, and use these coins to make a windchime to hang on your porch or to store in a curio cabinet or to wear as jewelry, and you are doing nothing fraudulent.

I'd be surprised if Bitcoin drops anywhere near that much.  It was at $1100 nine months ago in March and rising.  In June it dipped to $1938, then went back on the upswing.  It dipped again in Sept to $3226, and then went back up.  In Nov it dropped to $5857.  
None of the dips in all that time were anywhere near the low of the previous dip.  No one knows for certain, but I don't think we will ever see $1100 again.

Because now banks hold all the power over your money.  They, or the government, can cancel your credit card, freeze your bank account, and even refuse to accept cash payments because those bills you got from an ATM machine might (or might not be) counterfeit.
With Bitcoin you are your own bank (unless you are uneducated and leave your bitcoin in a wallet belonging to an exchange).
Bitcoin has been called the money of the internet.  Just as internet shopping has decimated brick-and-mortar shopping (for better or worse), so will the banks fall to Bitcoin.  The protests were indeed about shady investment practices and predatory lending.  Bitcoin will not make them change their ways, it will simply, and in large part, end their reign.  (At least that is the hope.)  It isn't about a re-distribution of wealth; it is about returning autonomy to everyone (rich or poor) who uses money by removing the central controlling authority. 
Andreas Antonopoulos describes this process in greater detail and with an eloquence I can't begin to match.  I'd suggest watching his youtube videos for a better explanation.

You need to use a software wallet to sweep the bitcoin from that paper wallet.  In an Electrum wallet you would select: wallet &gt; private keys &gt; sweep.    Then you enter the private key of the paper wallet in the box that pops up.  Once the bitcoin is in your Electrum wallet, you can do a send transaction to send it wherever you wish.  Other software and hardware wallets probably work much the same way as Electrum.

If your bi-weekly salary is $900 and your expenses for that 2 week period are $200 for rent, $100 for food, $200 for utilities, and $200 for miscellaneous expenses, this is what you would probably do:  
Let's  say you can pay for groceries with bitcoin.  You get paid, you immediately convert $600 worth of bitcoin to fiat to meet your expenses that have to be paid in fiat, buy groceries with btc, and save the rest of your bitcoin.
As long as you are being paid the bitcoin equivalent of your fiat salary, I fail to see the risk.

For those who are concerned about fees, it might be better to recommend buying $50 worth of bitcoin than $10.  You *can* buy $10 worth, and this might be a useful amount for a newbie to buy and practice sending from one address to another.  
However let's take the iconic example of buying a cup of coffee with bitcoin.  The miners' fee would cost more than the price of the coffee.  However, paying for coffee, snacks, a t-shirt, and a gasoline fill-up for your car with bitcoin, would be more practical because the fee for spending $40, $50, or $60 worth of bitcoin is no higher than the fee for a $2 cup of coffee.  The same is true for credit card use.  I pay cash for that single cup of coffee, but would use a credit card for a larger purchase of multiple items.

The point is that you pay fees on both bitcoin and cc purchases, and you do not pay fees by using cash.  It is impractical to use either btc or cc to pay for a cup of coffee.
The fact that you are paying fees on money you do not own when you use a credit card (hence the term *credit* card) is irrelevant.     You pay these fees with *your* money, just as you pay a miners' fee with *your* bitcoin.

If you have bitcoin stored in paper wallets, it is always wise to store your bitcoin in *multiple* paper wallets, no matter how much bitcoin you own.  If you save an incorrect digit in the private key, or lose your private key, or make some other mistake with one paper wallet, the bitcoin in that paper wallet would be lost forever.  A good rule of thumb is to never store more bitcoin in a single paper wallet than you can afford to lose.
A paper wallet is a simple pairing of a public address with a private key.  It lacks the software of a software or hardware or online (the least secure type of wallet) wallet, so a paper wallet has no software that can become obsolete over time.  A paper wallet will last as long as bitcoin itself.  On the downside, you cannot spend/send bitcoin directly from a paper wallet, but you will need to *sweep* (empty out) the contents of that paper wallet into another wallet that runs on software.  For long term offline storage, properly made paper wallets are an inexpensive and secure way to store bitcoin.

Each Bitcoin ATM has its own policies.  As has been said, you can get a profile of ATMs near you here:
 
We recently used one for the first time in Keene, NH and the process was seamless, even for newbies like ourselves.  (We are even newbies when it comes to smart phones - just got one a few months ago, for this specific purpose.)    We used cash - fed the machine $20 bills.  The ATM tallied each added bill on the screen.  We used SMS verification which consisted of texting to the machine and receiving a text in return with a number code which we typed into the ATM.    This particular machine had these verification requirements:
$1-1500 per day with SMS
$1501-2999 per day with SMS+ID
So you would be able to buy only a fraction of a bitcoin, even with ID.
The way this particular machine works is to show its scanner a QR code of a BTC address belonging to the user.  I had printed the QR code to a paper wallet belonging to us, and held the paper bearing that QR code up to the scanner.
At that point the machine asked if we wanted a receipt, which we did.  Receipt was printed out and the bitcoin showed up in our wallet on the Blockchain.  By the time we arrived home (it was a two hour drive from home to the ATM, which is in a small news shop) it had received 22 confirmations.
The ATM was so much better of an experience than Coinbase!  I'd highly recommend it.

I know you were.  My point is, if Bitcoin becomes the universal currency and fiat banks become more-or-less obsolete, these folks will turn to crypto exchanges to store their currency.  Surrogate banks, you might say.  More dangerous than banks, but these people won't see it.  Autonomy is an undervalued commodity and most people are not even aware it exists; they are seeking an authority figure to protect them.
Then again, my predictions could be all wrong and banks could continue to flourish by selling a centralized crypto to the masses.

How secure your bitcoin is is entirely up to you.  If you are an excellent security guard, your bitcoin is safer than money in a bank.  If your private key exists only on a single piece of paper, then you are a sad excuse for a security guard, and a bank is probably the best place for your money.
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:44:35
You are angsty, period, with a short attention span.   Those of us who believe in Bitcoin, don't care if the price drops, because our autonomy is not threatened by the fiat equivalency of our coin.  (The price has never dropped to the $1100 it was in March of 2017, and it never will hit the lows of 2014 again.  If BTC price in fiat is what matters to you, you need to take a broader view.)

I store my bitcoin in paper wallets and use an electrum wallet on my desktop to spend/send them.  A paper wallet or a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor are the most secure options.  
Storing bitcoin on an exchange is not a good idea for many reasons, the first being that the exchange controls the private key to their wallets so if you store your bitcoin there, it is not really your bitcoin.  The second is that an exchange is an attractive target for hackers, so your bitcoin is at risk if stored there.

Reps. Polis &amp; Schweikert introduce Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act in Congress
Bipartisan bill will make it much easier to use Bitcoin to pay for every day goods and services. 
BY JERRY BRITO / September 7, 2017
In April, Coin Center explained how the tax laws affecting digital currency transactions create serious friction for consumers and merchants and discourages the use of Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) as an everyday payment method. We also outlined how Congress could address this problem. Since then we have been working with congressional staff to develop legislation that would address the problem, and today I’m thrilled that with the leadership of Rep. Jared Polis and Rep. David Schweikert, co-chairs of the Blockchain Caucus, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act has been introduced in Congress.
The bill does two things. First, it creates a de minimis exemption for cryptocurrency transactions for goods or services. Today, if you buy a cup of coffee with bitcoins, you’ll have to calculate and report any gains that you experienced and pay tax on any gains. Under the bill, any transaction under $600 would be completely exempt, so you’d neither have to worry about keeping track of gains on all the little purchases you make, nor would you owe taxes on those small gains. This mirrors the same kind of exemption that foreign currency enjoys today and we think it’s a simple and fair way to avoid discouraging the use of cryptocurrency.
Now, there are many other transactions above $600, such as getting in and out of investment positions, on which capital gains tax will be owed. Today, you are responsible for keeping track of and accurately reporting every cent of gain. This is in contrast to your stock broker, who provides you and the IRS with a 1099-B form accounting all your gains and losses. Indeed, in answering Coin Center’s amicus brief opposing the IRS’s unprecedented and overbroad John Doe summons against Coinbase users, the Department of Justice noted that, “If Congress had subjected bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase to similar reporting requirements as those imposed on an online stock broker or a barter exchange, no John Doe summons to Coinbase would likely have been necessary[.]”
We’re not sure if such informational reporting requires an act of Congress, or whether the IRS could have provided for it through rulemaking and has simply opted not to. Whatever the case, the other thing the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act would do is require the Treasury Department to issue guidelines for informational reporting on digital currency transactions for which capital gains is due.
A de minimis exemption that completely excludes all small transactions, as well as clear IRS guidance and informational reporting, would be a lifesaver at tax time for cryptocurrency users. This is the first time a bill has been introduced in Congress to encourage cryptocurrency’s use and development and Coin Center is thrilled to be a part of it. Now the real work begins: getting it passed--and we’ll need your help!

There was a crypto-currency fairness act intended to end this idiotic tax law, restricting capital gains tax to amounts over $2000 (or some similar amount) that was introduced into the United States Congress, but apparently this bill has died there without ever gaining traction.
@_date: 2017-03-03 01:51:30
I am in the same boat, but doubt it is due to low fee.  I have the slider bar on Electrum's "send" tab set to maximum fee, and this has worked very quickly to process past transactions.
I'm getting the same "submissions beyond limit" message too, when attempting to use the accelerator.

This topic has been much on my mind lately after the death of my husband.  I have been trying to dispense with my earthly possessions a bit at a time.  None of my relatives have any notion of bitcoin nor need for it, so I may eventually give it away to a worthy (or not so worthy) redditor when the time comes.  I did this with some of my b-cash after the hard fork.  My bitcoin is in cold storage for the time being.  Similarly I gave my hunting rifle to my cousin to keep it from being melted down for scrap by one of my anti-gun heirs.  What to do with crypto poses an interesting dilemma when one is staring  into the abyss.

Fidelity bonds protect an employer from illegal or incompetent behavior of their own employees.  Their employees are charged with keeping the exchange's security system working flawlessly.  If an employee screws up and the security system suffers a glitch, even a brief one, and a hacker gets in, then it's covered.  If the security system remains intact and a hacker gets past it, that is not covered.
It is one thing to insure a small pool of your own employees, and quite another to insure against every hacker on the planet who wants to access a decentralized currency by getting past the latest security measures that you have in place.

I got into Bitcoin less than 6 months ago to buy things with it.  I bought all sorts of household goods, health supplies, pet supplies, clothing, and jewelry.  I replenished some of the btc I had spent (slightly less than $200 worth of btc) and stored it in a paper wallet.  I put $95 into another paper wallet strictly for saving.  The bitcoin in those two wallets is now worth nearly $900.  I fully intend to use some of it to buy more things, make some donations, and I will replace the btc I spent.  It's all relative.  I can buy more stuff by spending less bitcoin now, but will pay more to buy replacement bitcoin.  It is Bitcoin's use as a currency that gives it value.  Otherwise it would have none.

Recommendation on how to redeem Bitcoin Cash
July 31st, 2017.
Electrum is a Bitcoin wallet created by Thomas Voegtlin in 2011.
Electrum is distributed by Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company
registered in Germany, using the website 
Electrum users who are not interested in Bitcoin Cash do not need to worry nor to take any particular action. The following note is only for users who want to access their Bitcoin Cash (BCC).
"Electron Cash" is a fork of Electrum for Bitcoin Cash. Electron Cash is not endorsed by Electrum. It is open source, and binaries
(executables files) are available for Windows, OSX and
Android. However, when you run binaries instead of source code, you have no guarantee that they match the source code. This is why wallet binaries are usually signed by developers. A digital signature engages the responsibility of the person who signs.
The person who distributes the Electron Cash binaries has decided to remain anonymous, and uses the fake name "Jonald Fyookball" in order to sign Electron Cash binaries. Thus, if these binaries contain code that is designed to steal your bitcoins, the author of the theft will be anonymous and walk away safely with your funds.
This danger is exacerbated by the fact that the default behaviour of Electron Cash is to silently copy all your Electrum wallets into its
own directory. Thus, if you run Electron Cash on a machine where you previously used Electrum, all your pre-existing wallets will be
available in Electron Cash, and you will only need to enter your
password in order to expose your bitcoins to potential theft.
Therefore, users who want to run the Electron Cash binaries should do it on a separate machine, that does not have their Bitcoin wallet. We recommend to proceed as follows:
 1. Install Electron Cash on a machine that does not have your
 Electrum wallets.
 2. Wait until the BCC hard fork has taken place, and a few BCC blocks  have been mined.
 3. Move all your Electrum funds to a new Electrum wallet. This will
 move only your BTC, and not your BCC, because the BCC blockchain has replay protection. Wait until the transaction is confirmed.
 4. Enter the seed of your (now empty) old wallet or private keys in
 Electron Cash. Since the BTC have been moved to a new wallet,
 entering your old seed in Electron Cash will not put your BTC funds at risk.
Following these 4 easy steps you will be able to access your BCC
without compromising your BTC.

A paper wallet is a public address and a private key, period.  That is all a paper wallet is.  It is a bare bones wallet, minus the software programs that a wallet like Electrum or Trezor runs on.  
Create a number of paper wallets using this procedure:
1) download the bitaddress.org zip file here and unzip
(Alternatively, go to bitaddress.org and choose the "GitHub Repository (zip)" link at the bottom)
2) Clear your web browser cache
3) Unplug your LAN cable and disconnect wireless from your desktop
4) Power off your PC and Printer - Power on your PC and Printer
5) Run the local copy of bitaddress.org
6) Print (at least) 2 copies of these new addresses
7) Clear your web browser cache
8) Power off your PC and Printer - Power on your PC and Printer
9) Plug LAN cable in - Turn on wirless if you need to
To properly store addresses
1) Once you add coins to these addresses, treat them like cash.
2) Store one in your home, maybe in a safe.
3) Store the other in a safe deposit box, or off site safe
Now, as to your question, send your bitcoins from the exchange to the address of one of your paper wallets, or better yet send part of your btc to one paper wallet, some to another, etc so as not to have all your eggs in one basket.
You can go here to check on your bitcoin in your paper wallet (or any wallet)  
If you wish to spend your bitcoin at any point, you will need a software or hardware wallet to sweep the contents of one of your paper wallets into, and then to send/spend your btc from there.

A fidelity bond protects against *employee* theft or mistakes.

A paper wallet consists of a public address and a private key.  Both are long strings of digits that can also be written as a scan-able QR code, the private key being the longer one.

Alternately download a software wallet or buy a hardware wallet, and that wallet will generate and use those private keys for you (you will not see the private keys) and it will provide you with a collection of seed words that you must remember and guard as you would a private key(s).  The private keys will be under your control as long as you have your seed words.

I think I missed part of your question.  You would transfer your bitcoin directly from the exchange to the address of your paper wallet.  The exchange will use the private key associated with their wallet where they are storing your bitcoin to do this transaction.  You will keep the private key to your paper wallet safe, until and unless you decide to move your bitcoin from that paper wallet (by *sweeping* that bitcoin into a software or hardware wallet like Electrum or Trezor).  Did that answer what you were asking?

Is 2X another term for BitcoinCash, aka BCC or BCH?
Will I be able to buy BitcoinCash from Coinbase?  If I can and do, can I use an existing paper wallet (an empty one) to store my BCC?  Can I  download a new Electrum Wallet specifically for BCC?  
If I must use BCC to buy things, I would prefer to keep it completely separate from my bitcoin.
On the other hand, is Bitpay going to cease accepting bitcoin and only accept payment in BCC?   If one can continue to pay a merchant via Bitpay with bitcoin, can't I just purchase more bitcoin from Coinbase and use this "post-fork" bitcoin to pay without the dangers of using my "pre-fork" bitcoin?

You don't even legally own them.  Bitcoin is not protected by any law.  If someone steals your private key, they own your bitcoin and you have no legal recourse.  That is what "no controlling authority" and "being your own bank" means.  If you own bitcoin, you are your own security guard.

I think the main barrier is that most business owners do not know what bitcoin is or how it works.  I've never experienced a delay in an order using bitcoin, and the fees are hardly noticeable, no worse than a CC fee.

I was just pondering the situation of buying a cup of coffee at my local convenience store.  They don't accept bitcoin, and if they did I wouldn't be using it for coffee for two reasons:  one, it is cheaper and more convenient to hand the cashier a dollar bill or two AND two, more importantly I don't have a smart phone so have no means of paying with bitcoin when I'm away from my computer.  However, if this same convenience store were to offer a card that I could fill with btc (by doing the transaction at home) entitling me to, let's say 20 cups of coffee when the card was full, I would absolutely do this.  In fact if you could pay in btc for a credit of $100 that could be used for coffee, gas fill-ups, or anything for sale in their store, I would be so jumping on this bandwagon.  Then it would be a single bitcoin trx.  It's a ways to go before this becomes reality, but I think it could be on the horizon.  Some pizza places do this now, not in my area unfortunately.

They were holding 20% of btc sales previously and just now upped it to 50%.  I don't know how long they were keeping the 20%, or even when they enabled bitcoin payments for their products.

That's a good strategy if you are buying goods that cost over the $600 limit.  Probably when I do get ready to make more btc purchases, that is what I shall do regardless of the value of the merchandise.
*Q-12: Is a payment made using virtual currency subject to information reporting?
A-12: A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the
same extent as any other payment made in property. For example, a person who in the
course of a trade or business makes a payment of fixed and determinable income using
virtual currency with a value of $600 or more to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in a taxable
year is required to report the payment to the IRS and to the payee. Examples of
payments of fixed and determinable income include rent, salaries, wages, premiums,
annuities, and compensation.
Q-13: Is a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment
using virtual currency worth $600 or more to an independent contractor for
performing services required to file an information return with the IRS?
A-13: Generally, a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment
of $600 or more in a taxable year to an independent contractor for the performance of
services is required to report that payment to the IRS and to the payee on Form 1099-
MISC, Miscellaneous Income. Payments of virtual currency required to be reported on
Form 1099-MISC should be reported using the fair market value of the virtual currency
in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment. The payment recipient may have income
even if the recipient does not receive a Form 1099-MISC. See the Instructions to Form
1099-MISC and the General Instructions for Certain Information Returns for more
information.

Are you attempting to send bitcoin to Overstock from Coinbase or from your own private wallet?
If you want to pay Overstock out of your own wallet, click "BITCOIN ADDRESS" (instead of the "COINBASE WALLET" that is now hilighted).  Then you will go to your wallet (Electrum let's say) and make a send trx of that exact amount of bitcoin to the address that will be shown.
If you wish to have Coinbase send the btc, then you will go to Coinbase and have them send this specified exact amount of bitcoin to this address.
In either case you will pay the exact amount of bitcoin on this screen to the address specified by Overstock.  Whether you send from Coinbase's wallet or your own wallet (Electrum for example) you will need more bitcoin in that wallet to cover fees.  You can set the fees yourself in Electrum (or other wallet) but Coinbase sets their own fees.
Does this help?

The trouble with this is what would happen if Electrum or Mycelium should fold and their software become obsolete.

Two things that are primarily gender-specific are communication and shopping.  Remember when the internet came into being?

I don't typically buy anything that inexpensive online (with btc or USD) because the shipping/mailing fees make that impractical.  I only resort to online purchasing of a small cheap item if I cannot find such a thing in the non-cyber world, like a tube of a specific type of glue for instance.  (Two unfruitful trips to hardware stores in the real world not on my direct route to the grocery store will start to cost more in gasoline than buying the damned thing online and paying the shipping.  Convenience is worth money, as is time.)

The Bitcoin network is in its infancy.  It is small but not inefficient.  All you need to send and receive bitcoins is a wallet.  I think you have this confused with a computer used for mining.  
Of course it is dangerous to store your btc on an exchange.  That is why there are so many warnings about this on these forums.  It is also dangerous to store fiat dollars in your car.
The internet was met with this same level of fear, confusion, and distrust when it first became available to the general populace.

Every bitcoin address has its own private key.  The address is a long string of digits, and the private key is an even longer string of digits.  Both can also be written as a QR (scan-able) code.  You can share a bitcoin address with anyone.  You should not ever reveal your private key except to use it to send bitcoin from that address.  Once you have used your private key to send bitcoin, you should never re-use that bitcoin address again because its private key has been revealed and that address is now compromised.
A paper wallet is simply a bitcoin address and its corresponding private key.  Any other type of wallet (software, hardware, or online) will have many addresses.  Each address within that wallet has a private key, but you will not ever see these private keys because such a wallet's software uses these private keys and protects these private keys from all eyes, including your own.  In other words, a wallet of this type does the work for you, and it hides all the private keys.  It also hides each spent address to prevent you from inadvertently re-using it.  This wallet is basically a collection of addresses, each with its own private key (as opposed to a paper wallet which is a single address with its private key).  A software, hardware, or online wallet gives you a sequence of 12 words, and perhaps a password as well, and these are the keys to your wallet, this wallet being all the private keys to all of the addresses within that wallet.

Best advice is: Don't even think of buying bitcoin on an exchange until you have thoroughly researched Bitcoin and bitcoin wallets, and obtained a safe wallet with the private keys under your control.

You do not wait for a confirmation from an online merchant.  You get a receipt the instant they receive your bitcoin into their wallet.  You click "send" and your receipt pops up.

If Mycelium works like Electrum, and I'm guessing most software wallets work the same, these are your "seed words" which give you ownership of your wallet and the private keys within.  Your wallet will generate many public addresses, each of which has a private key.  The wallet is doing the work for you, so you do not actually see the private keys, but they are under your control as long as you own this wallet.  If you lost your phone, or if it was destroyed, you can use the seed words to re-generate your wallet on a new device and recover any bitcoins you have stored there.  
Seed words are not private keys, but they protect your Mycelium wherein your private keys are stored.

I sweep the contents of a paper wallet into the Electrum, send bitcoin to a merchant, then send the change into another paper wallet for storage.  I wouldn't lose sleep over coins stored in my Electrum if for some reason I had to leave them there for a week, a month, or even a year, but they are safest in a paper wallet.

If it is a small trx like buying a pizza, the customer does not wait for confirmations, but only for the BTC to appear on the Blockchain, which is pretty much instantaneous.  Chargebacks on a CC or BTC sent w/o sufficient fee is an affordable risk that merchants just swallow.  If the purchase is large, like a meal at an expensive restaurant, the  restaurant can require an ID.

I leave the slider all the way to the right (max) as a default.  This pretty much guarantees that all transactions will go through.  However, if there is a traffic jam on the block chain, I have been known to go to tools - preferences - check 'set fees manually' and then type in a ridiculously high fee of 0.002 - 0.005 btc in the "send" box.
The fee that Electrum uses as a default is very low.
Upon re-reading your post I wonder if you are confusing the time limit with the time it takes to complete your "send" transaction.  Bitpay has such a time limit - it shows a clock counting down, but once your bitcoin has been sent and has arrived on the blockchain, I've never heard of a wait for your trx to confirm.

They should have followed the oft-given wisdom to not buy more Bitcoin than they could comfortably afford to lose.   They will not be bleeding money unless they convert Bitcoin back to fiat when BTC's fiat value is lower than when they purchased it.  My point is that the value of Bitcoin is steadily rising, has been from the beginning, and if all it represents to someone is a fiat investment, patience will result in gains.
For those of us who believe in Bitcoin, it is a currency and a means to autonomy, not an monetary investment.  It is an investment in the future, not a get-rich scheme.

That's true, but some people trust it exclusively to store their keys.  If you haven't stored your keys externally, you are dependent on a fragile technology to store them.  In 2050 or 2060, if that trezor is no longer working, and you have not secured your keys elsewhere, you might find that your BTC has been irretrievably lost.  (For short term storage, as in a decade or less, a hardware wallet is a good solution, but I'd still back up the key words.)

4 locations.  One for half of a private key or key words, another for the other half of that/those keys, hand-written on paper.  Repeat with two other halves of a paper in two other locations.  Inks are not always permanent, so personally I use pencil lead for both halves of one of these.  
Using a printer is a bad idea because modern printers have memory just like a computer, and there are programs that can search the clipboard on your computer for anything resembling a private key.
It's ironic that the safest way to store keys to digital currency is the old school way, with a pencil and paper, but there you are.

Storing half of a private key or 1/2 of your seed words in a different location, for a total of 4 hiding places would be even better.

What does it say about your marriage that you told this to a bunch of strangers on reddit instead of telling your life partner?
If you had told your wife all that you've told us, about the assets that you've come into, you might have reached a meeting of the minds on how to spend it and what direction to take.  You could tell her your misgivings about losing her salary as a source of income, listen to her side of things, maybe reach a compromise, for instance she could take a part time job that she hates less than her present one.
Think how you would feel if you learned that she had come into an inheritance or gotten an enormous bonus at her job, and had hidden it from you while asking strangers on the internet for advice about whether or not to share this info with you.  I'm guessing you would feel betrayed.

These mugs do not use batteries nor do they charge batteries.  These are ordinary ceramic coffee mugs, and filling one with hot coffee (or hot tea or any other hot liquid) provides the heat to activate it, aka cause the image to appear.

You should be aware that far more drugs and other illegal activities are financed by fiat currency (dollars, pounds, whatever) than by crypto-currency.
At present places that accept bitcoin payments and who collect and charge sales tax (the laws on sales tax and online merchants is pretty much still a grey area) list prices in the currency of a customer's country and then translate that amount to bitcoin at checkout, usually using a processing service like BitPay or Coinbase.  Those merchants who actually collect sales tax add that in to the final price.

In these days of the ubiquitous acronym and abbreviation, they, and everyone else, will embrace the term.

I'm very picky about my tea, and 2 requirements for me are that tea must be organic (Fair Trade is also a plus) and must be in tea bags (because I'm a lazy tea drinker).   If you were to offer both organic black tea bags and organic green tea bags, I would absolutely buy from you, using bitcoin and on a regular basis.  For herbal tea, I would be interested in a mix of chamomile and mint, again organic and packaged in tea bags. 
On edit, I see that the word "organic" is part of your store's url.  I missed that at first.  So these products all are certified organic?   If so, I would add the word "organic" to the product descriptions.  Otherwise the site looks good -very easy to navigate.

I witnessed the destruction of protective regulations that began with Reagan, were continued by Clinton and Bush, and were completed by the Supreme Court in 2010 like the cherry on top, and saw how they changed the world by turning over wholesale power to the corporations.  I witnessed the results of Clinton disarming the FCC, the creation of NAFTA, and granting permanent normal trade relations to China which allowed corporations to exploit unprotected workers abroad.  Then there was the transformation of our society into one of eternal war and prison under Obama, driven by the military industrial complex, expanding arms of law enforcement, and the for-profit prison industry.  These changes have all been profit motivated by govt officials who allowed themselves to be bought and paid for, and perhaps strong-armed into facilitating them.  This country used to have checks and balances to control corporate greed, and they worked.  I have the perspective that you lack, having witnessed America before and after the checks and balances were abandoned.
But what the hell, even without our country falling into this pathetic state of disrepair, the end will be coming soon with the rise of A.I., or with total environmental collapse because humans are too stupid and too greedy to control our own numbers and to care for land,water, and air, or with a virus with no cure.... pick one.

No, I'm lazier than that.  I bought a box of those do-it-yourself tea bags 8 or 9 yrs ago and used them to make herbal tea bags when we had a lot of chamomile growing wild on our property, together with the wild mint that grows by our brook. Drying the herbs and packaging the tea bags was a lot of work but I didn't want to let all that chamomile go unharvested.  Now trees have grown to shade the chamomile into oblivion, I'm nearly a decade older, and I don't want the hassle.  Those seal-it-yourself tea bags are great though, if you want to take the time.

Capital gains means that your bitcoin has appreciated in value from the time you obtained that bitcoin until the time you exchanged it for goods (or for fiat).

Good questions, all.
To send bitcoin from a software wallet (like Electrum) you would only need your password to do a send transaction.  Electrum stores the private keys to each address inside your Electrum wallet and supplies them "under the hood" so to speak, and encrypted, to sign a send transaction.  (A password is easier to commit to memory than a collection of a dozen seed words in the correct order ~or~ a long string of digits which is a private key.)  With a software wallet (or a hardware wallet also) IF that wallet were lost, stolen, or stopped functioning (the computer or phone or a hardware wallet itself like Trezor for instance) or burnt up in a fire, then you would use the seed words to recreate that wallet and retrieve your bitcoin.
I'm not familiar with hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor because I've never owned one, but these wallets allow you to sign a transaction offline and then to process that transaction online.  That is why they are safer than software wallets like Electrum.
A paper wallet is simply a pair of a bitcoin address with its private key, so all you would need to safeguard with a paper wallet would be the private key.  Paper wallets are very safe if they were created on a secure computer using correct protocols, but they have their downsides, and one is that a paper wallet cannot be spent from directly but must be swept into another wallet in order to be spent.

A bank can put a hold on your money for whatever reason or by mistake.  Gold was once legal tender, but in 1933 through 1974 the government made ownership of gold coins illegal.

It is instant.  My experience is limited to 20 or so smallish purchases, each ranging in value from approx $50 - $100 (USD).  For each purchase two screens popped up in quick succession, the first stating "You have sent __ btc to ___ (wallet address of the merchant), and the second thanking me for my order and providing me with an order number.
All my purchases were made online, so I'd imagine that the merchant waits to ship my item until my transaction has received at least one or more confirmations.  But since few or no online orders are instantly shipped, no matter what the payment method, receipt of your merchandise takes no longer with a bitcoin payment than with fiat payment. 
I have no experience with paying for travel or hotel accommodations, or with purchasing a meal at a restaurant, so my experience is somewhat limited.  I've only bought household items, clothing, pet supplies, and the like, but it probably works much the same.
You can go to:   (the address you sent the bitcoin to here)
to see your transaction gather confirmations.  Depending on traffic on the blockchain and what your wallet included as a fee, it can take 5 minutes to 2 days to get that first confirmation, and 20 minutes is somewhat typical.

It depends on the exchange.  Some exchanges only accept bank withdrawals to sell you bitcoin, but Coinbase has always accepted credit cards as well.

Yes.  To clarify, Coinbase has online/web wallets where they offer to store bitcoin for their customers.

Usually a business owner will use a processing service like bitpay.  This processing company keeps track of the exchange rate for the merchant.   An item would be priced in fiat on the business' website, let's say 29 USD.  When a customer clicks to make a purchase, a bitpay screen comes up that states "please send ____ amount of bitcoin to address _____."  After the bitcoin has reached the blockchain, a screen comes up that says "Thank you for your order."

If the law passes, yes you can, unless they add in some provision about that.
Capital gains tax applies to bitcoin spent for merchandise or exchanged for fiat.  If the fiat value of your bitcoin has increased in the time that it has been in your possession, the amount of increase is the amount you pay taxes on.  For this reason I've been purchasing bitcoin immediately before any purchase I make, to avoid owing tax, and I leave the bitcoin I hold in storage separately and indefinitely.  All my purchases are well under $600, so I hope this legislation will pass.

I didn't see your linked article, but I guess anyone can write an article and assign years and names to a generation, but 20 year olds refer to themselves as millennials, as did the reporters covering the scores of them who attended Bernie Sanders' events last year, so that's good enough for me.

For someone who already has bitcoin on an exchange, better advice is to not acquire anymore bitcoin right now, but instead research wallets and get one, then practice by sending small amounts to that wallet, and only then get the remainder of your bitcoin off that exchange. But start that process right now.  
For all those who are thinking about buying bitcoin, this thread will educate them before the fact.  For every person who posts there are probably hundreds of lurkers just considering getting into Bitcoin.  I think that one of the first pieces of advice I received here on reddit was to never leave bitcoin on an exchange.  Practice with small amounts of btc to start was another pearl of wisdom that helped me on my learning journey.

I'm 67 and learning about bitcoin and how to use it was very difficult, but I was highly motivated and had help from various sources.  My husband is more techy than I am (he used to do beta testing for software companies) and he helped me figure it out, all the while proclaiming that he thought bitcoin was stupid.  He's 71.  Now he has come around, after seeing me successfully order and receive various household merchandise paid for with bitcoin, including a cabinet from Overstock that he helped me assemble, and learning that the bitcoin I put in a wallet just to save has tripled in value over the past 6 months.  He gets it now.
We were just visiting the off-the-grid farmers that we buy our pasture-raised chickens, pottery, and preserves from, and just for the heck of it I asked if they took bitcoin.  She asked "How do you get bitcoin?"  Clearly she was interested, and it was not a new concept to her.
I think it will just take some time for older people to embrace btc and to learn how to use it.  Look how many older people learned to surf the net and send email when the internet was new.  I'm convinced it will come.

We humans are herding animals.  Most people do not want to "be their own bank."  Witness all the people who choose to store their bitcoin on Coinbase despite warnings.  Most people are programmed to seek a leader rather than to be their own leader.  (This isn't the same thing as being stupid exactly.  It is built into all social life forms to preserve order within the species.)  Autonomy is not a commodity that the majority value or even recognize.  For those of us who do value autonomy, Bitcoin is the answer.  For the rest, perhaps something else will come along, like a Bitcoin debit card issued by an exchange or a bank, to give those who seek it a sense of security.  How real that security will turn out to be is anyone's guess.  Perhaps they will be safer than they are at present with our predatory banking system.

No it doesn't.  If a seller accepts bitcoin payments, bitcoin is what you pay with, usually using a processing service like bitpay or coinbase.
Whether or not the seller chooses to convert the bitcoin you send him to make a purchase, is up to that seller.  Overstock's CEO for instance has always kept a portion of his bitcoin sales, and has recently upped that amount to 50% of all bitcoin sales.  I'm willing to bet he's not the only one.

When I was eight I had a bank account that my parents opened for me and put money into periodically.  I kept the bank book in a bureau drawer and looked at it frequently.  I understood what it was and I was glad to have it.  When I outgrew my bicycle my mom asked if I'd like to put the contents of my bank account toward a bigger bicycle and she would pay the rest, and I agreed.   Was I unduly influenced?  Maybe, but I put a lot of miles on that bike and learned the concept/rewards of saving and spending money.  One thing is for sure, if my mother had suggested I spend the money on a doll, or on clothes, I would have resisted mightily.

You are wise to make an initial small purchase to learn how to use bitcoin and how it works.  Good advice I was given when I first got into Bitcoin was to practise sending very small amounts of bitcoin until I got the hang of it, as in $5 worth of btc to start.  More good advice is to only buy an amount of bitcoin that will not devastate you if you lose it, because losing btc is very easy to do.

This is a much better article about this bill:
a partial excerpt:
"Reps. Polis &amp; Schweikert introduce Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act in Congress
Bipartisan bill will make it much easier to use Bitcoin to pay for every day goods and services. 
BY JERRY BRITO / September 7, 2017
In April, Coin Center explained how the tax laws affecting digital currency transactions create serious friction for consumers and merchants and discourages the use of Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) as an everyday payment method. We also outlined how Congress could address this problem. Since then we have been working with congressional staff to develop legislation that would address the problem, and today I’m thrilled that with the leadership of Rep. Jared Polis and Rep. David Schweikert, co-chairs of the Blockchain Caucus, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act has been introduced in Congress.
The bill does two things. First, it creates a de minimis exemption for cryptocurrency transactions for goods or services. Today, if you buy a cup of coffee with bitcoins, you’ll have to calculate and report any gains that you experienced and pay tax on any gains. Under the bill, any transaction under $600 would be completely exempt, so you’d neither have to worry about keeping track of gains on all the little purchases you make, nor would you owe taxes on those small gains. This mirrors the same kind of exemption that foreign currency enjoys today and we think it’s a simple and fair way to avoid discouraging the use of cryptocurrency.
Now, there are many other transactions above $600, such as getting in and out of investment positions, on which capital gains tax will be owed. Today, you are responsible for keeping track of and accurately reporting every cent of gain. This is in contrast to your stock broker, who provides you and the IRS with a 1099-B form accounting all your gains and losses. Indeed, in answering Coin Center’s amicus brief opposing the IRS’s unprecedented and overbroad John Doe summons against Coinbase users, the Department of Justice noted that, “If Congress had subjected bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase to similar reporting requirements as those imposed on an online stock broker or a barter exchange, no John Doe summons to Coinbase would likely have been necessary[.]”
We’re not sure if such informational reporting requires an act of Congress, or whether the IRS could have provided for it through rulemaking and has simply opted not to. Whatever the case, the other thing the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act would do is require the Treasury Department to issue guidelines for informational reporting on digital currency transactions for which capital gains is due."
Now is the time to write to our Congressmen and Senators!  Handwritten, old school-style letters via US Mail get their attention more than email.  It's worth the effort.  (It wouldn't hurt to also thank the two Congressmen who crafted this bill.)

Those situations would require different strategies, strategies that unfortunately would involve trusting a 3rd party that you may or may not fully trust, it's true.  My point is that, because your own power of attorney dies when you do, the only sure way to have your possessions pass on to a person of your own choosing is to give them before your death.  In the case of all things, especially private keys to your bitcoin, possession is 9/10ths of the law.  Actually, in the case of private keys, it IS the law.

It would have been worth minus many times that sum if it had compromised my bitcoin, my PC, or my Electrum wallet.  You can have it... or you could have if you had private messaged me first, back when I was giving it away.  I let it sit for several weeks, expecting it to be stolen, prior to giving it away, but there were no takers despite the private key having been revealed in the sweep trx.
(Stick around; I have more BCH in at least one other paper wallet.   If and when I decide to sweep the bitcoin from that (those) wallet(s), I'll be giving away more bitcoin cash.  Unless Overstock and other online merchants were to suddenly cease accepting bitcoin payments, and only accept BCH in its place, I will continue to just want my forked coins gone.)

The number of upvotes that high value posts on this forum attract seems to affirm that the greedy/misogynist faction is a vocal minority, and not worth notice.
As to marriage, it works fine for those who are lucky enough to find a compatible mate and those who treat one another with respect.   I've been married for nearly 50 years.  Marriage is a legal contract, and with no-fault divorce, a reasonably equitable contract for both parties.  It sounds like the OP is going through a relatively amicable divorce, but it is sad that it didn't work out for him.

If you qualify for a line of credit, it should be no one's business what you spend that money on, providing it is legal to buy.  A CC is not a car loan or a home loan where they take into account said car or house's collateral value.  You've already been vetted by the bank and deemed a safe risk for the $5000. or $10,000. or whatever line of credit they have granted you.  This is why the banking/CC industry, as we know it, is existing on borrowed time, because of their overreaching behavior.  They know this, and this is their retaliation against their competition, aka cryptocurrency.

Since most merchants' bitcoin sales make up only a very small percentage of their overall sales (1% in the case of Overstock) I think they would have no difficulty in holding 50% of 1% of overall profits. It also seems that for any merchant, big or small, to accept bitcoin payments, they have to have a personal interest in Bitcoin and a belief in its future, because bitcoin sales are a drop in the bucket for most.  It follows that such a merchant would be likely to hold onto at least some of the bitcoin they take in.
For those merchants who might, at present, view accepting bitcoin payments as some sort of marketing gimmick, an increasing amount of profit from bitcoin sales down the road could cause them to begin to believe in the future of Bitcoin, and subsequently hold onto some of it.

I am an nontechnical old woman with poor math skills, but 6 months ago I learned how to store bitcoin safely, how to spend/send it, and how to buy it.  All that is required is the patience to research and ask questions.  The side bar on this site is full of helpful links. Youtube has a lot of helpful videos - those made by Andreas Antonopoulos are a must-watch.  If I could learn how to use bitcoin, *anyone* can.  You just have to educate yourself and proceed with caution.  Bitcoin is completely different from any currency that has gone before.  No central authority controls or insures it.
If you don't know what a private key is, you are just beginning your bitcoin education.  Take your time, research, and learn... *before* you buy any bitcoin.  Get a private wallet that you control *before* you acquire any bitcoin.  Start by buying a small amount of bitcoin, an amount you can easily afford to lose.  Send that bitcoin off the exchange to your wallet.  If all goes well, repeat, perhaps a few times, before buying a larger amount of btc.

I'm far left, strongly anti-war, and libertarian (not in favor of removal of a social safety net or abolishing/lowering taxes, but rather in favor of drastically removing governmental reach into the private lives of citizens).  Autonomy is one of my most cherished commodities, which is why Bitcoin speaks to me.
As to  the problem with mainstream adoption is that most of the general public want a central authority to protect their assets.  They want to believe that cyber-currency exchanges have insurance protecting their bitcoin, just as FDIC protects their fiat money, and they have no desire to be their own bank.  I suppose some sort of licensed and insured brokers could come into being that would send and manage BTC for customers, and I think banks might create their own cryptocurrencies with a centralized Blockchain, but people using these services are not Bitcoin owners..   So, while many technological innovations become widely used by the general public, I'm not certain that Bitcoin, by its very nature, ever will be.

Thank you very much for researching and reporting this in such detail, and for alerting the virus databases.  I've passed this along to my more-techy-than-me husband, and he tells me that we don't use diskimager, but he clearly views this sort of malware as a threat that will likely propagate and become more sophisticated and widespread.  He also said that code could probably be written that would discern *where* the contents of the clipboard were being pasted, and activate only if they were pasted to a specific location like, say, a transaction window.  So, it seems, I can't definitively test my clipboard by pasting a bitcoin address into a text document, but need to carefully check it in the actual trx window every time before sending.  
I'm sorry you fell victim to this malware, and appreciate the time you took to share your research.

You could also pass a counterfeit bill or charge back a credit card.  A point here is that the shopping I've done is all from online merchants.  They have all my info, so if I scam them with a bitcoin payment, they know where I live.  Probably my transactions have all confirmed by the time my orders were shipped anyway.  
In the case of a few drinks at a brick and mortar bar, the risk for the bar owner is minimal.  If someone starts running up a large bar bill, he would likely require a drivers license.  The same would almost certainly be true of a brick and mortar merchant before they would let you leave with a computer or a piece of furniture.

If your first transaction has a single confirmation, it will go through almost certainly.
As to the "low fee" tx, personally I set my Electrum to enable the "replace-by-fee" (so that you could increase the fee if a transaction fails to get confirmed) 
and select "edit-fees-manually" here:
Tools (at top) &gt; Preferences &gt; Fees
Then when sending bitcoins:
Send:  In the box to the right of the Slider Bar, Enter the amount, and Check "replaceable."
I set a fee of 0.002 - 0.005 btc (usually 0.002 btc which is twice the amount of the slider bar set to maximum).  To me, the assurance that every transaction I make will go through without issue is more important than saving 3 or 4 bucks.  I don't make many transactions, for one thing, and another thing no one else seems to mention, is that I purchase bitcoins while the price is low (in relation to the USD) and spend them when the price goes up.  This alone saves far more than the fees cost.

Electrum is a software wallet, not a paper wallet.  With electrum you are given 12 seed words in a particular order with which you can recreate that wallet (if your pc or phone where this wallet is stored dies or is stolen).  You indeed copy these seed words onto a piece of paper with a pen or pencil, and store this paper and a copy of it in several locations, but this does not make it a paper wallet.  Electrum is a software wallet.
As to the seed words, it is recommended to write down two copies of them, tear or cut each paper in half, and store these in 4 different locations.

Don't leave your btc on an exchange, ever.  Transfer them to a secure wallet that you own and you control, as soon as you buy them.  The thing about a crypto-currency is that there is no central controlling authority.  The downside to this is that YOU are your own bank.  If you do not secure your bitcoins, they can be easily stolen, and you have no recourse.
I use Coinbase, and I am happy with them, but I use them to *acquire* bitcoin, not ever to store them.

You can fuck a merchant out of money with a bad credit card too.  Merchants do not wait for a bitcoin confirmation to send a paid receipt, and many people on this forum do not understand that.  If you buy something online, that merchant has all your info, so if a tx doesn't go through due to low fee or double spend, they know where to find you.  If the merchant is a bar owner, the price of a couple beers is not a huge loss, and the gain of more customers because they accept bitcoin is probably a strong counterbalance.  If a bar patron is buying more than a few beers, the bartender could request a drivers license.
My point is that in the real world of using bitcoin as a currency, one does not wait for confirmations to complete a purchase.  That is not how it is done.  I've bought many things with bitcoin.  Have you?
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:07:21
If you have a hardware or software wallet, these are pretty safe.  A hardware offline wallet (like trezor) would be the safest.  Sending newly purchased bitcoin to such a wallet would be quite safe.  If you wanted to create a paper wallet to move some or all of the bitcoin from that HW or SW wallet later on in the future for total safe-keeping, especially for long-term storage, leaving the btc in your HW or SW wallet in the interim would be quite safe.  The only danger to a trezor or electrum wallet would be if the technology changes or a company goes under and you have your btc stored in one of their wallets.
What you really do not want to do is leave bitcoin on an exchange or in an online wallet.  That would be unsafe.

Your fiat money, aka credit card, debit card, or bank account, on Coinbase is insured against theft in accordance with FCC rules.  Your bitcoin is not insured.  If you are a bitcoin owner YOU are the bank, and you are your own security guard.  If your bitcoin is lost or stolen, you have no recourse.  That is the downside to bitcoin ownership.

I keep my bitcoins in several paper wallets for this very reason, and the amount of btc I own is not a lot.  If you have substantial amounts of bitcoin, then this advice is more relevant.   Diversity is always a good idea. 
I have an electrum wallet that I use for spending only.  If a software wallet or hardware wallet stops working, you can always get a newer, different wallet to recover your btc from cold storage.  If you've somehow mis-copied or lost the private key to a single paper wallet, your loss will be less if that wallet is one of several.
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:47:26
It's a sliding scale.  I'm not struggling to get by, but I can't afford to spend $1450. on an investment either.  I have small fractions of bitcoin in a few paper wallets, two for spending and one for holding onto.  
For myself I want bitcoin to become a currency that I can use (more than I already do). I wish more bitcoin enthusiasts had this same goal.   I live for the day when Amazon enables bit payments for their sellers.
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:17:07
How is it not?  You click on the send tab on your Electrum wallet and set the fee.  Then you copy the amount of btc and the bit address you're sending to from the invoice, paste both into the appropriate boxes, and click "send."  Your receipt from the person or business marked "paid" is pretty much instantaneous.
Usually for me, I have to sweep a paper wallet into my electrum wallet before I perform the buying tx.  However if I stored bitcoin in my electrum (as many people do) it would take under a minute to send coins.
I think a lot of people who do not actually use bitcoin as a currency don't understand the process of spending bitcoin.  Your purchase is finalized as soon as the seller receives your bitcoin.  You don't have to wait until your transaction is confirmed for the sale to be finalized.
I have purchased everything from pet supplies to household furnishings to clothing with bitcoin, and all my purchases went through immediately.  Out of curiosity I've looked at a few of my transactions on the blockchain, and by the time most of them were confirmed, my purchase had been a done deal for many minutes or hours.

The advice about the high risk of storing bitcoin on an exchange is valid for everyone in any country, but I was replying specifically to your post about Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:14:42
Confirmations on the blockchain are not instant.  We all know this.  However if you bought a beer at a bar or bath towels from Overstock or a handmade ring from an etsy seller or fidget cubes from a guy in Australia, the bartender would pour your beer as soon as the bitcoin hit his wallet and the other merchants would instantly send you a "paid" receipt as soon as the bitcoin hit their wallet.  
Someone else on this thread mentioned buying Amazon gift cards with bitcoin, and stated that for a sale there to go through, a tx must be confirmed first.  I'm guessing that the sale of gift cards is a very high risk business due to the high value and instantaneous nature of gift cards, but this is an exception.
By "hitting their wallets" I mean the record of the bitcoin going to them shows up in their wallets, but it has not yet been confirmed on the blockchain so the actual bitcoin is not yet there.  Someone else described it as the transaction reaching the mempool, and I guess that is a better way to put it.  
Most people are not crooks  and obviously merchants would not accept bitcoin if that were the case.  But people scam merchants with credit cards and counterfeit bills too, so bitcoin is really no riskier for most merchants.  In the case of a bar or restaurant, the loss would not be great if the patron defaulted, double charged or deliberately sent a low fee tx, and if it were a very expensive bar bill, they could ask for a drivers license.  As far as online purchases, these are not shipped instantly, so I'm guessing by the time the merchandise is shipped the tx will have been confirmed, but the sale is finalized immediately.  Also these merchants have their customers' information.

The "sweep" function is for moving the contents of a *paper wallet* into a wallet that one can spend from (a software, hardware, or online wallet).
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:00:48
I follow a version of these steps when creating paper wallets:
1) download the bitaddress.org zip file here and unzip
(Alternatively, go to bitaddress.org and choose the "GitHub Repository (zip)" link at the bottom)
2) Clear your web browser cache
3) Unplug your LAN cable and disconnect wireless from your desktop
4) Power off your PC and Printer - Power on your PC and Printer
5) Run the local copy of bitaddress.org
6) Print (at least) 2 copies of these new addresses
7) Clear your web browser cache
8) Power off your PC and Printer - Power on your PC and Printer
9) Plug LAN cable in - Turn on wirless if you need to
To properly store addresses
1) Once you add coins to these addresses, treat them like cash.
2) Store one in your home, maybe in a safe.
3) Store the other in a safe deposit box, or off site safe
My own modifications to these instructions are thus:
I do not use a printer.  I copy and paste the private keys and public addresses to each paper wallet as  I create them into a text document *that I do not save at this time.*  I number each of these wallets.
Next I write down selected segments of each private key onto a piece of paper along with the corresponding number of that wallet, and remove those segments from the private keys in the text document.
Then, and only then, do I save the text document.  (Technically I do not save the document per se.  I copy the info from it into the middle of another text document that has to do with an unrelated subject, like how to build a ship in a bottle for instance, and then I delete the unsaved text document.)  I have one copy on my PC (which is also copied on an external harddrive) and another copy on a thumb drive in a remote location.   I keep two copies of the associated paper with the missing parts of the private keys in two other locations.  
When I have done this I empty the clipboard.
When I want to spend a paper wallet I reconstruct the private key using the text file and the paper, and sweep it into my electrum wallet.
If I were to store a large amount of bitcoin, which I have never done, I would split it among multiple paper wallets, each one holding an amount of bitcoin I could afford to lose if somehow a private key were lost or mis-copied.

What *you* do not understand is how bitcoin purchases between a buyer and a merchant work.  Merchants do not wait for a bitcoin transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain before they finalize a purchase.

Merchants who accept bitcoin list their prices in fiat currency, and the payment invoice that is sent you during checkout (processed by bitpay or coinbase or similar partner exchange) specifies the amount of bitcoin you owe (according to its value at the time of processing) and the bit address to send it to.

Bitcoin's purpose is spelled out in Satoshi's "white paper" for that matter. Some of us are, in fact, interested in Bitcoin as a currency.  A certain faction of 1% wannabes have loud voices, but I won't speculate on their numbers.  They could be a vocal minority or not.

I follow a version of these steps when creating paper wallets:
1) download the bitaddress.org zip file here and unzip
(Alternatively, go to bitaddress.org and choose the "GitHub Repository (zip)" link at the bottom)
2) Clear your web browser cache
3) Unplug your LAN cable and disconnect wireless from your desktop
4) Power off your PC and Printer - Power on your PC and Printer
5) Run the local copy of bitaddress.org
6) Print (at least) 2 copies of these new addresses
7) Clear your web browser cache
8) Power off your PC and Printer - Power on your PC and Printer
9) Plug LAN cable in - Turn on wireless if you need to
To properly store addresses
1) Once you add coins to these addresses, treat them like cash.
2) Store one in your home, maybe in a safe.
3) Store the other in a safe deposit box, or off site safe
My own modifications to these instructions are thus:
I do not use a printer.  I copy and paste the private keys and public addresses to each paper wallet as  I create them into a text document *that I do not save at this time.*  I number each of these wallets.
Next I write down selected segments of each private key onto a piece of paper along with the corresponding number of that wallet, and remove those segments from the private keys in the text document.
Then, and only then, do I save the text document.  (Technically I do not save the document per se.  I copy the info from it into the middle of another text document that has to do with an unrelated subject, like how to build a ship in a bottle for instance, and then I delete the unsaved text document.)  I have one copy on my PC (which is also copied on an external harddrive) and another copy on a thumb drive in a remote location.   I keep two copies of the associated paper with the missing parts of the private keys in two other locations.  
When I have done this I empty the clipboard.
When I want to spend a paper wallet I reconstruct the private key using the text file and the paper, and sweep it into my electrum wallet.
If I were to store a large amount of bitcoin, which I have never done, I would split it among multiple paper wallets, each one holding an amount of bitcoin I could afford to lose if somehow a private key were lost or mis-copied.
I am much more comfortable with my bitcoin stored in a paper wallet, because if the technology of a software wallet changes, or a hardware wallet company goes under, this will not affect my bitcoins.  A paper wallet means that you are your own bank and your own security guard.  The security of a paper wallet is as good or as bad as you make it.  Since I highly value autonomy, and have somewhat of a distrust in constantly changing technology, this is my chosen method of storage.

Unless you want to move/sweep your bitcoin from the paper wallet into your Electrum wallet, do not reveal or import the private key of your paper wallet.
Is your Electrum wallet a newer version?  Mine is, and the instructions for using it have changed a bit.  In the instructions that I downloaded when I got my Electrum, it talks of "importing private keys" as part of a 3-step process for "sweeping" a paper wallet.  However in my Electrum wallet, they have simplified the "sweeping' process as such:  "Begin by selecting the Wallet&gt; Private Keys&gt;SWEEP" at which point you enter the private key of your paper wallet and click "broadcast" in the new box that opens showing your transaction.  So Electrum is still importing your private key but they have made it easier for the user.
I hope this makes some sort of sense.  If you do move/sweep your bitcoin from the paper wallet to your Electrum wallet, don't ever re-use that paper wallet again because its security will have been compromised.  
Personally I store my bitcoin in paper wallets and move/sweep bitcoin into the Electrum when I want to buy something with bitcoin.  I treat my Electrum as a spending wallet and my paper wallets as storage vaults, but both are pretty safe.  
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:15:41

@_date: 2017-05-11 15:06:32
All the bitcoin payments I've ever made are instantly accepted by online merchants, regardless of how long they take to be confirmed.  Usually they are confirmed pretty quickly because I set my Electrum to a fairly high fee, but my purchases go through before that first confirmation.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:57:57
That is why I store bitcoin in a paper wallet and just use my electrum wallet as a spending wallet.  However Electrum gives you a seed, which is a series of 12 words, that you can use to reconstruct/recover your wallet on another computer or device should a hard drive die or your pc or phone be stolen or lost.  A software wallet is far safer than leaving your bitcoin on an exchange.  That is sort of the 101 of learning about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:15:19
That is true.  It would definitely be easier.

This would be true if you were using an online computer.  Keep in mind, this is done on an *off-line* PC that has its browsing history wiped before and after the procedure to create paper wallets.  The clipboard is erased before the computer is reconnected.

If the bitcoin had been sent, it should show up immediately on the blockchain (at the above url) before it receives any confirmations.  It would just say "0 confirmations" and the amount of btc transferred there.  If it isn't, then I have to think that your transaction was never broadcast.  Did a screen appear on Coinbase stating that "You have sent __  (amount of) bitcoin to ___ (address of paper wallet)?"  Is Coinbase still showing that you have a balance of $120 worth of btc on their site?  
Coinbase is probably acting kind of squirrel-y right now due to the exponential increase in traffic.

You do not wait for a confirmation.  If you were running up a large bar bill or ordering filet mignon and lobster, they might ask for photo ID, but normally they just eat the loss if a tx fails to go through, the same as they do for fraudulent credit cards or counterfeit bills.  
In Japan, insurance companies have just created policies for restaurant/store/bar owners to insure against failed bitcoin transactions. 
That shitload in miners' fees is no greater than fees if you choose to pay with a credit card.  However with a bitcoin payment your personal info is not at risk of being stolen or hacked as a payment with CC is.

If you do not send the correct amount of btc, a sale will not go through.  Most merchants would refund your bitcoin and have you try again to send the correct amount.
You could send the correct amount and then resend the same transaction (double spend) or you could send it with 0 fee or a very low fee, in which cases the bitcoin would be returned to your wallet after a bit and never be confirmed on the blockchain.  Those are the only ways you could scam a seller with bitcoin.
No one can see on the blockchain how much bitcoin you might have in a wallet.  They can only see that x amount of bitcoin was sent from one bit address to another bit address.

You can add bitcoin to a paper wallet as many times, or as often, as you want, because this requires only the use of the public key to your paper wallet.  When you sweep a paper wallet (withdraw/send all the bitcoin in that paper wallet) into another wallet (a hardware or software wallet) you must use the private key to that paper wallet.  Once you have done so, you should never re-use that paper wallet because its private key has been revealed and it is no longer safe.

I should explain my system of storing private keys and public addresses to my paper wallets to my husband too, on a semi-regular basis.  I have told him, but he'd probably not remember.  Neither of us are spring chickens and our memories aren't what they used to be.  Still he's more of a tech-y than I am, so if he knew the keys to our paper wallets, he'd be able to figure out how to sweep them into my Electrum or some other device, and spend them from there.  
It's something to think about if the value of our btc continues to increase and I don't spend them.  I'm more likely to survive him, but one never knows what fate has in store.

Yes this could happen. I trust the anti-malware programs on my PC more than I do my printer and whatever data it might be storing, connected or not.  There are very few alternatives to a clipboard or a printer.  Technically you could copy the entire private key with a pencil and paper, but human error there would be more dangerous than other options.  I guess if you were holding large quantities of bitcoin, buying a computer for this purpose alone, a PC that would *never* be connected to the internet, would make economic sense.

This kind of anonymity exists if you pay an individual person for a good or service in exchange for bitcoin, but the same is true of cash, aka "paying under the table" and off the record.  If you purchase something from an online company however, that company will need your name and address to send the product that you have purchased, and there will be a record of this transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:20:56
Send your bitcoin to your wallet first, then to a 3rd party.  I send my bitcoin from an exchange (as soon as I buy it) to a paper wallet, then eventually (I let it sit for awhile) to my electrum wallet to spend/send it.  That puts a buffer between your purchase of bitcoin and where you sent it.  But yes, every transaction is on the blockchain, and an exchange can see the bit address where btc purchased from them was sent, and follow where btc was sent from that address, and so on.
A wallet where you control the private keys should always be the first step for anyone just getting into Bitcoin.  Actually purchasing bitcoin on an exchange (and sending it immediately to your wallet) is the second step.  Cart before the horse.
