thanks for the advice and input dude. I'm trying to do the same as you, except I've only got a smaller amount to work with haha.

indeed. I am honestly debating whether to sell my shares right now while its ~2.9. I have a gut feeling it's going to go down by Saturday night than surge back up around Tuesday. Unfortunately, my gut feeling has made me lose BTC before so I am quite unsure...

Other than that I've had no problems with coinbase. Be careful about keeping bitcoins on their wallet though. They might go under or the website might get hacked. It's always safer to keep btc in your own wallet granted you take proper security measures, but even then it's not 100% safe

I believe he said at the earliest they'll have the next generation ready by October. Problems can definitely come up between now and October

for sure. Share prices jumped up already.
Cheaper USB sticks would be great in terms of sales for the company

this is exactly the case for me... I studied engineering, didn't have any experience or knowledge on markets, investing, etc. Bitcoin has made me very interested in trading and investing and I learn new terms and concepts everyday. I'm always hesitant in buying/selling because I realize I still don't know that much...but it certainly is annoying when everyone is telling you to BUY BUY BUY once the hype train comes around.  
I'd like to know what your thoughts are about how to invest, outlook on ASICMINER or BTC as a whole!

i was able to sell 0.2 BTC on coinbase when the prices were around $240. I made the mistake of "unlinking" my checking account a day before the transaction was supposed to be completed by.
Now for the past 3 weeks I've been trying to get in touch with their support team to see if I can the money or at least the 0.2 BTC back. Some guy named Olaf just responds with something along the lines of:
"Yes we were not able to send any money to you. Sorry about that!"
Wtf?! How is that a proper response?

I think it does So do this at your own risk.
I had sold a few coins before the big bubble and had deleted the bank account before the money was processed through. Didn't receive any cash for weeks so I had to email their customer support which was a pain in the ass because they were so unresponsive. I eventually got reimbursed for the equivalent BTC value at the time so it worked out in the end
