It isn't just "coming from nowhere". 
If the government, say, taxed people, and then burned the money (or threw away the private key) then that would be artificially induced deflation, and yes that would be stealing. 
Deflation with a fixed money supply doesn't "come from nowhere", it comes from an improving economy (more goods &amp; services available to buy + same money supply = higher value for the money). So unless you consider all forms of investment "theft", there's nothing wrong with some natural inflation.

Not really. You need at least 1000 coins to be a whale. Thats true because only whales can redeem ETFs.

Bitstamp isn't as bit as BTCChina and Huobi
Also I don't know but bitfinex is pretty big too. I think about same size as bitstamp. 
So bitstamp is probably only about 20% of total bitcoin volume now
