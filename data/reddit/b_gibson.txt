SegWit may or may not contain technical debt itself, but one thing it does do is refactor away old technical debt left over from Bitcoin's early implementations, like tx malleability.

* A marketable security that tracks an index, like Gold, Oil, S&amp;P500, etc.  In this case Winklevoss brothers are creating a Bitcoin-tracking ETF.

Start with *[Research Perspectives and Challenges for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies]( it gives a good overview of what's interesting about cryptocurrency for academics and researchers.
Then a few more sources to dig around in:
1.  [Papers]( and [Research]( sections at Nakamoto Institute
3.  [Bitcoin wiki](
4.  [Ethereum wiki](
5.  [Z.cash technical FAQ](
2.  [Lightning Network paper](

Steve's advice works for consumer electronics but not for mission critical fiduciary cryptosystem engineering.

There are (at least) two problems making this difficult:
1.  The negative side effects are continuous not binary.  There are negative side effects to *any* block cap increase, even by a single bit.  The big question and point of contention is how much is too much?
2.  Exacerbating  is that there's a high-variance time lag between when architectural decisions are implemented in production and when problems may arise from them.  In some cases it's nearly instantaneous, as with the client bug in 2013 that necessitated a blockchain rollback, but in other cases problems may not metastasize for years, for example they work at small scale but break down at large scale (aka, the fundamental problem all public blockchains face).
If there were some means of reliably predicting the effect of engineering decisions on complex, global, permissionless distributed systems over long durations then there would be much less of a debate, but alas at this point in time such a thing is voodoo magic, and the best Core can do is be very conservative, enforce constraints, and [innovate within them](  
And frankly they're doing a bang-up job of exactly that, there's some amazing engineering work coming down the pipe as a result of this constraint-driven engineering, and not just block-size related.

The market doesn't know.  Markets make mistakes, witness the GFC.
