Reading another site (that sent me here) you said you use a Canon Vixia HF G30 Hd Camcorder and a Canon Rebel T3i.
While I cannot afford a Vixia, I am interested in getting a T3i to experiment with shooting puppy and cat videos (I know, very different from what you do :) but I think the same principles apply) an would like to know what lenses would you recommend for the T3i (and what do you use?) ? Thanks!

Had a problem with RealityKings recently.
I signed up for $1 (supposedly all access on their site for 3 days) only to find out I could download less than 10 clips.
Plus when I checked my credit card statement online, I saw that they had taken the $1 twice... as well as full months money for two sites!
I got on chat with their "support" and was told that I had also signed up for another site when I agreed to the "$1 - three day trial" and once my three days were up I would be charged for both sites (around $70 if memory serves me right) I told them to shove it and cancel all accounts (which they did, with a bit of attitude). I guess they were just surprised that I got my statement so soon or that I could check immediately online, I bet there must be a huge bunch of suckers who get their bill past the 3 days "trial" and then can't do anything about it as "it's written in the TOS".

Thank you, it does help :)
A friend has a t3i and I have fooled around a bit with it (which is why I don't want to go in for the latest models). It came with the EF-S 18-55 mm as a kit lens.
But the quality of video was not as good as that on your site's sample videos... so I was hoping you could guide me to a better lens for that kind of close up videography.
Thanks for your reply though and good luck with your site, if you have any other knowledge you would like to share, it would always be appreciated!
