Yes you really have to check what fee you chose at the current rate, I chose a relatively high fee and a few minutes later while I send my coins my fee was relatively low instead. LTC now works fine for me but something tells me LTC isn't developing fast enough.

This is the reason I’m don’t see a very bright future. I can’t even sell mine because it is stuck for 3 days now and I did pay a reasonable fee.

Yes, I directly enabled it after I found out it wasn't on, my mistake. I hope after all the fee is high enough to go through soon so it doesn't get stuck.

I can’t even sell even if I wanted to because my transaction is stuck for 3 days now...

Have the same problem, my transaction to Binance is unconfirmed for about 3 days now.. don’t know what to do besides wait it out. The address is correct so I can’t lose it right.

I'll have the Electrum Desktop wallet, my transaction with a reasonable fee is stuck for days now.
 
Should I wait it out or do your trick? Honestly I have no clue how to do it and i did read your post a few times. Is there a step by step guide how to do it or something? Help would be appreciated!
