This, we sold off a stock that has for the past few years kinda been puttering out (irobot, looking at you man) and put that into bitcoin. I have faith that bitcoin will balance back out and climb. Plus, I like the thought that I'm helping to stick it to the banks. In my experience they're some corrupt mother fuckers. 
For example: 
A few years back we were denied a loan, not because of our credit score (no no that was in good standing) and not because of our debt to income ratio (only debt was house payment and cell phone bills) no no we were turned down for not using our credit enough. Not a late payment on our record but denied because the bank hadn't been making a profit off us outside of our account fees. That shit still pisses me off. We switched to paying everything on a credit card and paying it off monthly. Now the banks want to throw stupid amounts of money at us. Assholes.

This. Very very much this. Fuck the banks.

Yes, please, for the love of Bob. I tried to set one up using a text instructional guide and it failed. Windows 10. Kk? Chop chop. Thanks. Also video guide on how to open a channel for use.

Wishing I'd waited for this drop instead of buying more at 17k. Instead. I stand with the HODLR army, as we ride out the latest dip. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:11:50
Meh, I think I've been at this long enough now (okay no really only a handful of months) that I'm not worried about these dips. They happen. Bitcoin springs back higher. Right now I'm on the couch jumping up and down cheer on the panic mob who are selling. Sell, you gloriously stupid bastards, sell. So I can buy the dip! 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:02:19
It was rarely used because some people couldnt find too many places that accepted it. Completely different. 
My parents got bitcoin in 2017 and hodled it since transaction fees were high and few merchants used it. Once fees lowered from segwit/lightning network many major retailers began accepting it and my parents used it daily. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:31:58
Well... guess we should sell before he finds a way to bankrupt bitcoin too.

Hey, you crusty ass Incel. Kindly go fuck yourself. This feminist thinks your tiny dick and your unnatural latch to your mothers left tit just leaves you nothing more than a salty sack of shit. Fuck off, you misspent wank.

This woman is a bully.
She thinks she is so smart, yet I have seen her belittle the people she works with in a few of her videos.
She's not here to make anything better, but for the money only.
We don't need gold diggers and feminists expressing their hatred towards men in the bitcoin community.
I say this as a supporter of Bitcoin Core and the LN.

I'm sure it works similar but can you explain how this works if  you pay in bitcoin?

FYI: If you're military or affiliated with the military... USAA allows cryptocurrency transactions. They even encourage it. They have ways to add your coinbase account to your USAA account so you can track it from your USAA login. 
Any civi banks offer this? We need to get a list of Cryptofriendly banks going.

This. I'm still new but I'm jealous of the dip right now. We bought in originally at 6k and then again at 16k because I was tired of waiting for the dip seeing it skyrocket up. I'm seriously wishing I'd waited a week longer and bought in during this time. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:57:16
Damnit boo! I'm still waiting for my deposit funds to go through so I can buy more. Gimme my predicted dip!

I feel like there should have been video of this of a bitcoin octopus infront of a green screen giving us a bitcoin weather report. Thank you for this, Cryptooctopus! Have a hella fun and safe weekend!

How about we all just party like it's Y2K all over again if Bitcorn gets to 30k? Don't kill yourself. Too much salt all that. Plus, your promise of Sricha will never beat the "I'll eat my left nut" gag.

Thank you! Do you have a suggestion for a wallet that uses segwit then?

God damnit Bitcoin, if you hit 10k while I'm sleeping I'ma be mad. Okay no, I'm going to be thrilled but I'll be disappointed I missed the 10k memes as they're being made.

HODL, I'm HODLing, are you HODLing? Let's HODL!

This is so true. I'm constantly refreshing. It keeps getting so  close and then pops back down. Come on Bitcoin, you can do it! Mama needs a gold-plated Tesla. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:13:06
Yeah I had some random message me asking if I'd invested in bitcoin. I told him nope, I'd invested in Bacon. I'm not going to discuss privately with anyone where or how much bitcoin I might have. I'll geek out in the subreddit but folks getting up in my PMs seems a bit shady. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:59:18
I'm busy mining my Eth and Hodling my purchased Btc. And making plans to go buy a pizza at a joint in the next town over with my BTC this weekend. I hear amazon is thinking of taking bitcoin so hoping we can actually start using our bitcoin more. Still a noob but I'd like to begin moving away from USD and towards crypto this year. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:37:55
I'm with you. Sounds more like these guys are upset there is a kid and a girl in their playing field. She wrote a post further down explaining how it went down and it's quite plausible. She'd write it, pass it to him to overview and check her work and then he'd post it. Not unlike how many new coders would do, pass it to someone more experienced to go over and make sure it was correct. We do this in classrooms ffs with students. She also mentioned that yes, she paid a person twice for the cache and backend. I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt mainly because the OP sounds like a fucking dog with a bone that he just can't let go. 
TLDR? GFY OP, get a hobby, you could start by learning to build bridges and getting over things.

From there it's going to have a nice drink in a corner booth with a tall dark and handsome bull. From there it's going to go back to the Bulls apartment where they will both get railed by Bull's SO... Mr. Bear. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:06:30
Thank you! Yeah, I figured fluctuations were incoming. HODL and all that while we wait to see it come back out on top. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:36:59
I put 1000USD in a few weeks back for my birthday. I'm trying not to watch this on a daily basis but damn it's hard. So much fluctuation is just nail-bitingly crazy. I'm still trying to find a ELI5 for what this whole split means. Some folks are making it sound like we get double the value, others are making it sound like we stay the same but our bits hold value better than these new bits coming and frankly I'm just confused as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:03:04
