OK but the *average* is $20...

It is absolutely not a bond replacement.  Even if I agreed with you about gold, why would I chose a version of gold that didn't have demand for actual transactions when there are alternatives that do?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:19:49
I actually am very interested in the discussion and I'm not convinced one way or the other.  My inclination is that bigger blocks make sense because I think that transaction fees and delayed confirmations make Bitcoin basically unusable, so the reasons in favor of small blocks have to be pretty good.  That's just my starting point I guess.  Also, in your link it says:


I haven't heard a good argument as to why that is, but I'm reading the linked article.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:35:55
I don't think everyone is choosing to pay $20 fees on average out of ignorance like you suggest.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:43:50


How so?
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:39:21
Bitcoin cash (as an example) is literally bitcoin with larger blocks and a different difficulty adjustment algorithm.  And it's a hard fork.


Can you explain how that's the case, using Bitcoin Cash as comparison?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:58:07
Well the scaling problems have been predicted for years...  It's not like this came out of nowhere.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:30
I think this boils down to the question about full nodes. I've seen demonstrations that a full node can be run using a medium to high end computer with 1gb blocks. Running on 8mb blocks is trivial.
My questions are: why are node quantities important to maximize, do you agree that it is trivial to run a node on 8mb blocks, and are the massive fees better than any trade-off?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:24:01
Even if that were true (I don't think it is), you should absolutely kick the can down the road until you have a proper solution ready.  Unless I'm wrong, there's no actual disadvantage to increasing block size immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:30:29
Maybe, but that's way below the average of $20
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:27:10
Bitcoin is nothing like bonds, not sure how to explain that.
For gold, imagine you had gold A and gold B. A is completely worthless other than the fact that it cannot be duplicated and transactions are public and verified. It's difficult to move, so it cannot be used in every day transactions. Gold B has all of the good properties of gold A but is also easily used as an actual currency. This means that in addition to demand as a store of value, people demand it to use in transactions.  Based on these facts, why would you prefer gold A?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:26:06
Not true.  Miners switch to whatever is most profitable.


How is that different from Bitcoin/Blockstream?


I think you're confusing mining with nodes.  1GB blocks, which is reaching Visa levels of transactions/sec, would still run on an average 4 core cpu computer with 16gb of ram.  And that won't be needed until far into the future when computer tech will be even better.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:41:13
Why do you think it was botched?
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:20:21
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:32:00
I'm answering your question:


Yes they can, with ease.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:25:12
OK, but they didn't say trading would be available immediately, just that you could send/receive
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:27:49


I don't actually think there are tradeoffs.  At least, I haven't seen any downsides that are reasonable.  And that's really the crux of the issue - what are the actual downsides of increasing block size?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:08:58
We're long past $2 transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:11:44
If you want to talk about nodes that's fine, but don't get them confused with mining.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:30:10
Why do you need those nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:34:51
You're confusing nodes with mining again.  I'm not going to continue this discussion if you don't know the basics.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:51:53
Number of ISPs is heavily influenced by regulation and is not ideal. That should not be the model
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:51:55
That's the only thing you got out of that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:43:47
Not sure where you are getting those updates from, but this is from their announcement:
Bitcoin Cash sends and receives are functional. Buys and sells on the Coinbase website and in our mobile apps will be available to all customers once there is sufficient liquidity on GDAX. We anticipate that this will happen tomorrow.
I guess it doesn't really matter.  They knew that trading wouldn't happen immediately, but it probably took more time than they wanted.  I wouldn't call that botched.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:49:17




It was removed probably because mods are in the tank for blockstream
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:07:16
I sent you a link that showed they could run 1gb nodes with a 4 core, 16gb machine.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:00:29
Yes they can. Watch the link i sent you - a normal computer can run a 1gb node.  They tested it.  And hardware tech is going to get much better by the time we even get close to needing that.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:49:50
Why will Roger be the only one running nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:18:17
You're quoting something I didn't write
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:09:00
Can you explain why block size increase causes centralization?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:19:41
That says bithump is 36% of volume over last 24 hours, which is a lot but not a majority.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:58:13
As a bystander in all this, these vitriolic comments on this sub without anything backing them up are really troubling.  I highly doubt BCH is a scam at this point and it the people actually moving money around seem to agree.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:08:50


You can try and manipulate the price of any asset.  Just because I don't care that much about bitcoin doesn't mean that I therefore don't understand markets and economics.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:19:10


How does that make any sense?  If someone sends you BTC, you get BTC.  If someone sends you BCH you get BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:54:51
Here's where I'm confused and I'm really trying to understand this so bear with me.  Currently the problem with BTC is that transactions are expensive, slow, and supposedly unreliable (not sure about the last one).  BCH devs and others are saying that a larger block size fixes that immediately.  BTC devs are saying that there is a solution down the road some time (lightning network?) that will fix this, and that continuing to increase block size will cause problems in the far future.
Even if all of that is valid on both sides, why not increase block sizes in the short term and then long term look for a better solution?  Or don't if computing power increases dramatically or whatever?  I'm very hesitant to buy any bitcoin if is not desirable to use it for real transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:26:31
Could you please let me know where I can get paid for shilling?
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:55:13
it takes one minute to figure our is talking out of his ass
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:31:42
Can you give me a source on that?
I would be more suspicious if there was no concrete reason to switch from BTC to BCH, but many people are claiming that there's lower fees and faster transaction times.  As someone who owns little BTC and 0 BCH and doesn't really know a whole lot about either, it seems reasonable that real people are genuinely interested in switching.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:18:14


Why would large fees and slow transactions not be a problem?  You can say it's not that big of a deal (I think it probably is) but it seems delusional to think that it's neutral or a positive.


Isn't that simply untrue?


He said in the long run you'd run into a problem, which may be true but it's not an answer as to why not to increase block size in the short term.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:25:41
cool theory, never works.  If your buying pushes prices up, selling does the same thing.  And the difference is that if anyone is knowledgeable and previously held the asset, they will quickly sell at the higher price or short it.  So now that hedge fund is immediately fucked.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:23:39


The condescension in this sub is unreal
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:19:47
No but I don't think that attempting market manipulation is actually profitable like many people on here seem to suggest.  Therefore, I think it's very unlikely that BCH being up is illegitimate in any way.
