Can it actually overtake Nike in value already?? Surely there's something wrong in the world if that can happen?!?

I grabbed it from this guy who writes funny Bitcoin stuff.

You scared me for a moment there. I thought she was the proverbial shoe-shine boy, but if she's a cool mom I guess that's different.

But who owns the OWNERS of the Federal Reserve? And who owns the owners' owners? And who owns....

Okay, so let's say bitcoin becomes a major world currency in a few years and its value rises to $1000 per capita. We're looking at another hundred-fold increase in Bitcoin's value to $400,000 per coin. And it would also mean a large number of early adopters would become billionaires. There would be all these new young billionaires who had done nothing except buy some near the start. Is that world conceivable? And how many of those billionaire "investors" would there be??

Of course it's not a company but comparing it to one helps to put bitcoin's current value into perspective I think. What else would you compare it to in order to give it's current level some meaning?

TV news viewers are a hell of a lot older than typical Bitcoin users. The average age of a Fox News viewer is now 68!

True. There aren't many original amazon investors still holding.

Blockchain is the gift horse, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is great, but does it really have to win out over all other currencies for the world to not be shit?
