*If* that's true, god help us.

Windows? No, Cronie. Also seven am, not eight. Can I ask how many peers you connect to, what bandwidth bitcoind uses, and how much dedicated bandwidth you have? I'm still doubting bitcoind is maxing your net.

I too am running not just one, but two full nodes, one in Europe and one in east America. Those boxes are also seeding Tails, Arch Linux, and the popular bootstrap.dat torrent on the bitcoin forums. Obviously, all port forwarded.
If anyone has any other suggestions, they both have bandwidth (~1MBit/s per, 24/7/365) and HDD space (many TB) to spare, so feel free to hit me.

Thanks, but I was thinking bash, I.E. scripting.

I always think when talking about BTC ransom-ware... what if it encrypts your private key? Both parties are fucked.

Incoming payment was at 20+ and 100+ confirmations before payment was confirmed and forwarded in the two cases I tested.


But the point is the issue is with *this* application. The transaction was stuck on the hourglass mode for multiple hours/days after I had sent the transaction.


Proof? I copied the SQL database over to my computer, all I could find was amounts/addresses (public)/note/confirmations, no private keys. [This github issue also seems to be in my favor]( and, so does [this]( code which clearly is making a http connection with your BTC Receiving Address by class 'ReceivePayments', which, returns an address (proved [here](
I'm not trying to be an ass, but, this program was extremely dodgy for me, and, I'd love to use it myself, but, I can't seem to find any valid info, just people's 'opinions'.

60min in hour / 10min per block = 6block per hour
6block per hour * 50btc per block back then = 300btc per hour

Can confirm, have penis and never had an issue.

I, and many others, host IPv{4,6} to Tor links, making any blocks/transactions on the clear web get to Tor-only users and visa-versa. 
I recommend others do this too, and also host Tor relays.

With the amount of offchain transactions sites use, I'd say it's more like 95%. Very rarely do you pay someone, you normally pay your 'account' on the site, then pay with your onsite credit.

Because those are exactly the people who could gain access to my HDDs, unlike randomers on the net. "Why don't you use torrents? " because nobody would be seeding three years in the future when I need them without incentives. "Why not use NNTP, HTTP, or {other}?", same reason. This application I assume people will say "you can use 1GB of space for $1/month", and, I'll say "I have 1MB of data, I want ten copies in the network at any single point, I'm willing to pay 1GB/month/copy", match and match are made and I start paying monthly amounts of $0.001 for his space, everyone's happy.

This was more to do with data protection than BTC

Isn't this still the case? I've spoken with more than a few parents that actually watch everything their kid does online (I.E. Sit behind them) and refuse them access if they're busy. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 02:01:07
Some cases, yes, some cases, no. If I have a lot of you stealing it, then yes. If not, then, even if you did generate it, you're still stealing my BTC.

Am I the only one who once copying and pasting my BTC address in, then copies it back into an armory 'send' page to make sure if days my wallet name below? 
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:47:08
Or, you know, rebroadcast them...
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:48:30
I tried that app, took days to get my payment to the end address, and, the 'paid' status didn't update for hours, what gives? Not very useful if you can't check the balance without manually heading to a block explorer. Also, who owns the address private keys? What if stiff goes wrong?

Sent, thanks.

As someone who has needed a decentralized place to keep a collection of HDD symmetric encryption keys (~1MB total, and, useless unless you also have my HDDs), ***FUCKING FINALLY. WHEN WILL IT BE OUT FOR PUBLIC TESTING/REVIEWING?***
I also assume it's own source, correct? 
@_date: 2014-09-03 19:11:50
Remember to also host a Tor hidden service on that.

`0 0 * * * /usr/bin/bitcoind`
`0 7 * * * /usr/bin/bitcoind stop`
Have fun!
EDIT:- I really doubt bitcoind will max your up bandwidth, it peaks at about 100KB/s up. The other peer has to perform lots of high-cpu tests on the data you send it that rarely the net I/O is the bottleneck. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 22:30:33
Windows? No. Linux, cronie, and at seven AM.
As for bandwidth, how many peers do you average? What bandwidth (actual numbers)?
