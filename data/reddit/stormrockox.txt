I don't care what news you hear always HODL on! You are not being forced to sell out every time something bad happens.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:06:06
I understand but this is all speculation right now.

I just realized I am the Storm Rock Ox, it would be against my name to quit now.

What are you basing this off of? BCH shitposter
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:33:49
What is this a haiku?
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:06:32
We've got to HODL on to what we got, ~~it doesn't even matter if we make it or not!~~
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:09:24
No offense but it seems like you posted this just to advertise Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:55:48
Hell I just made a post supporting Coinbase l

This is very outdated, please remove this post or you will cause confusion. Can we get the Admins in here?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:56:17
HODL on brother!
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:03:30
Please keep this sub reddit in English. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:27:28
I do not think it is fair for the government to get a cut of my profit from currency they have no control over! HODL forever!
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:57:13
I'm calm dude.

I am new at this, but this is what I have read in a book recently:
Each node verifies every transaction against a long checklist of criteria: ...
Each output value, as well as the total, must be within the allowed range of values (less than 21m coins, more than the dust threshold).
All in all, your dust may not be valid to use.

I would voluntarily lose a couple thousand in BTC just to see BCash tumble and fail. Update: it is failing!
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:42:48
HODL on brother!

I don't want to look at that damn calculator again it is worthless. Just give me a straight answer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:10:54
My apologies I thought you were another shitposter.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:19:46
Thank you for actually answering the question and not beatin around the bush!
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:27:56
Hey I'd be lying if I didn't seem to be advertising for other sites before.

I needed this post so much right now, you are the best!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:23:31
You are the hero we need right now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:45:24
Limited supply and unlimited demand.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:07:11
To be honest I can't tell what anything is. Is there a guy on top? Is that a dog in the lower half? I have no idea what is going on. Normally you can see things in abstract art but this is just random smears.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:35:23
How do you spend that much money so recklessly? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:29:21
HODL brother!  I am.

DigDug for Galactic Overlord! As first act, can you make one Bitcoin worth $140 million?

This takes away some anxiety, thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:54
You literally found this sub reddit just to shit post?  You need to get a life. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:03:03
More BC for the rest of us I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. You will never make gains if you don't take risks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:57:32
It's called Bitcoin. You are the type of person to freak out at any change. We already told you multiple times Bitcoin is volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:37:10
Go shit post somewhere else.
