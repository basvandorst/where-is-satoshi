What exactly is going on?

I saw the start of the dip and had $200 I was comfortable investing, I bought in at 16k thinking I timed it just right. Now here I am kicking myself.

What’s the deal with BCH? Just bought some BTC and was confused when I saw BCH on Coinbase. Kinda wish I had gone for BCH but I honestly have no clue what’s going on.

I bought in at 16k and then was “off the grid” for a few days. Really wish I hit the bottom of the dip!

I literally logged on to buy my first little piece of BTC because I saw that it was so low (about $16k when I bought in) and by the time the transaction went through there was this new bitcoin cash and I had no idea what was going on. 
So am I right to hold out on my BTC and ignore bitcoin cash? The numbers for bitcoin cash are tempting but that whole situation sounds pretty volatile in comparison to BTC.

Hey thanks for all the input. I’ve only put $200 into BTC as of now because a) I’m risk averse, b) I’m cheap, and c) that’s as much as I could invest in something so uncertain without putting my financial stability at risk. As things play out I may diversify a bit and invest a bit more but for now I’ll see what happens with my $200.

Holy shit I forgot about that treasonous bastard.

But, do you think he was literally speaking?
