Okay serious question, someone tipped me like .34 cents worth of bitcoin. I have it on some site called change tip. Can someone please tell me how I get the actual money from it lol The only thing I know about bitcoin is it's internet money, but I'd kinda like the paypal money =x lol

Thank you for the tip! And I hope it works out. I saved it also, I really love stuff like this. I move around so much and the amount of bad landlords I've had is crazy. I'm going to be moving to Canada here soon, I don't know if I can post outside of U.S landlords but if I can I'll make a post when I move there also. It's a bigger city so will probably help a ton also, Alberta Canada. And hopefully by then I can look up landlords from there also and see what I'm getting in to. Goodluck! and thanks again for the tip &amp; awesome site xD

Well yeah its not that much, but the thing is, I try and make a lot of money from any way possible and there are tons of ways to make bitcoin and stuff like that. I just need to know more about it cause I'm pretty clueless. Like I don't even know how to give it to another person. 
But my main concern is cashing it out. Like I don't understand what I do to turn it to real money. Do I use sites that turn it into cash and they send the cash to my paypal, do I trade it somewhere? Like I'm just confused tbh lol 
Edit: I found this site called coinbase, is this a good site? And how do I get the bitcoin from changetip into coinbase, its asking for my bitcoin wallet id but I cant find it on coinbase. =/ lol

Thank you. I actually found this site called virwox, and I read about it where I can transfer it to paypal. And thank you for the bit coin. I'm glad I'm learning this because its a good way to make money. I really appreciate it =]
