Good for them for giving it a go. It would be neat to see them try again, but I'm sure they'll stay away until we have a low cost transaction layer. The fees really do suck right now, and the price, while I'm not complaining, is moving so fast it is a little frightening.

I can’t even begin to imagine. Hope you get some good news man. That blanket is worth all the bitcoins in the world. Money is nothing without friends and family and good times and memories. I’ve lost family to cancer and it is truly awful how painful and unpredictable the disease can be. Hope your days are filled with lots of visits and your nurses all have big boobies. Good luck my friend.

It's sad really, that the options are so limited. I chose them because despite being primarily invested in Bitcoin, I had a few altcoins from dabbling with different mining rigs etc, and I wanted a way to exchange those. GDAX seems to be the best thing going, but they're limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC.
I was relatively happy with Kraken up until about a week ago.

I think some big shots are there, but all their wealth doesn’t compare to what widespread consumer investment would be like. And we definitely don’t have that. When employees can click “Bitcoin” as a percentage of their 401(k), then I think we’ll start to approach Bitcoins maximum potential.

Great story. If there's one thing to be said for a service like coinbase, it's that you're not totally on your own if you lose your password. I don't know if I trust myself enough to go to a hardware or paper wallet.

Good idea, like a Bitcoin proxy. The relay addresses would have to be one-time use I suppose, since you wouldn't want to mix even one legitimate payment with a tainted payment.

It’s Forbes. Everything you read on Forbes should be taken with a grain of “it’s Forbes“.

The Tulip Mania comparison baffles me. On one hand you have tulip bulbs, flowers, that were a fashionable status symbol. On the other hand you have a new currency with all sorts of interesting use cases. People get tired of fads. People don't get tired of things that have utility. The comparison is ridiculous.

Noob question: where is the value for miners once all Bitcoin is mined? Since miners keep the network strong, will the network dramatically weaken if miners leave?

Interesting that I scanned a bunch of news sites when BTC broke 5k, and again when it surged to over $5700, and none of them (CNN, Fox News, Google News, the NYT, and WaPo) had a front page story about it. The financial sites had a decent amount of coverage, as you would expect, but I just thought it was interesting. Usually when the stock market has a big day in either direction, it gets coverage on even the non-financial news sites. I'm not calling it a conspiracy here, I just think that it's a sign that interest in cryptocurrency has a lot of room to grow.

As someone who once forgot to report the cost basis of some stock sales, this is exactly right! I got a “correspondence audit” and just had to mail in proof of my cost basis, but prior to that the assumption was that that the cost basis was $0.

I sat on the sidelines for a long time but then I started investing a few hundred every month. Sometimes I get a good dip, sometimes I don't, but if you believe it has the potential to run up to 10,000 and beyond, timing is not that important. As has been said many times, you could be throwing your money directly into the trash, but the greater the risk, the greater the reward.

Not a bad idea to do everything on the up-and-up though. With the rise in price this year, the IRS will find all sorts of ways to track down BTC high-rollers.
