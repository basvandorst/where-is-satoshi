@_date: 2019-03-23 15:30:05
its funny these guys dont get it. literally 80% of all TA comments are like "waiting to buy the dip" "wait for it to go lower" GUYS IF WE ALL WAIT FOR IT TO GO LOWER IT WONT GO LOWER
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:34:34

@_date: 2019-06-21 11:51:37
are they on parade again already?
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:27:55
since everyone already expects to hit ATH by 2019, and everyone expects we retrace at ATH, im totally positive we could see 20k getting crushed like 4k-10k.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:40:13
its not stable. its headed upwards. ;)
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:19:51

@_date: 2019-04-02 15:25:43
dude the 4200 level got pressure since 3 months, it was pretty obvious it will break at some point and that there will be a LARGE candle once it breaks. just got heated up too much in the last days/weeks
@_date: 2019-04-26 16:56:02
