Any ideas / speculation here??? Why is this a trend with every currency and not just 1 or a few?

What do they get? Anything?

I agree with you there

It's like George Washington giving up the Presidency after just 2 terms. The ultimate test.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:54:31
Lol yup.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:43:23
Yeah seriously. That guy suggesting Litecoin as the one-true solution is like an insult to the concept of human intelligence.

Ok Bitcoin Cash troll. Fuck off.

All coins are down right now. Bitcoins and Altcoins. The entire market cap of all cryptocurrencies is down to 471 Billion (it was 630 Billion a few days ago). This is a coordinated attack of some kind. So your "Bitcoin dies, Altcoins rise." theory that you keep saying is invalid.

6 weeks, 4 days, and 32 seconds from now is good.
What a stupid question. Buy Bitcoin now.

What are reasons that you might not want to take it with you? Hypothetically if a border agent at international customs discovers it and knows what it is they could try to take it from you, but it's useless to them unless you share with them more information such as password or pin to access the wallet. In the unlikely event that they hypothetically steal it, you could just buy one later and restore using your seed, though I'm sure that ordeal would be extremely traumatizing regardless, especially if they detain you for a period of time. This is _EXTREMELY_ unlikely to happen and if you hide it deep in luggage while passing through customs then it's even more unlikely to happen. Is this what you're worried about?
I personally like to keep my wallets (both fiat and crypto hardware wallets) with me at all times, so I'd personally bring it with me if I were traveling internationally.

Is Coinbase properly broadcasting your transaction? Is there any record of your transaction on the Blockchain?

Bitcoin is like the head honcho of the crypto world, akin to USD in the fiat world. It's a good one to have and hold.
I like Ripple a lot also.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:02:31
I agree 100%.

It's normal for a transaction to take ~1 hour, sometimes even longer to get confirmations. I think OP is saying that Coinbase didn't even broacast the transaction.

Why would somebody buy Bitcoin at the price of what one is worth in the future? Why not just buy today?
I understand in the case of farmers wanting a guaranteed price for their crops, but in the context of Bitcoin, I don't understand.

The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution which limits US Presidents to 2 terms in office was ratified in 1951. So, Washington could have served for longer as President, since people wanted him to continue serving and he had support, but he voluntarily stepped down to let somebody else have the power, as an ultimate test to the democracy he created. That's sortof/kindof akin to what Satoshi did, who created Bitcoin, then voluntarily seems to have stepped away from the community, in my interpretation he stepped down to completely give his creation back to the community. I also think this is the reason he chooses to remain anonymous.   Maybe it's only vaguely similar, but the 2 have parallels in my opinion.

That's pretty sweet! I just tested it, and Coinbase wasn't allowing me to instantly deposit the USD from my bank account . It was making me wait ~9 days for ACH even though my Coinbase purchases using ACH are USUALLY instant, and I've built trust with them over years.
Are you guys are to utilize this method to get your USD instantly into Coinbase?

My Coinbase fee is $25.19 if buying 0.1 BTC using my bank account as source of funds. If I change source of funds to credit card then my fee is $67.45. The reason fees are higher using credit card as source is because Coinbase incurs additional fees themselves from the card processing companies (Visa, Master Card, etc), so they just pass that fee onto you. I don't believe they make any additional money here. My card company gives me 1.5% cash back on all purchases, so it ends up being roughly the same for me in the end.
No idea why you were charged $100 for buying 0.1 BTC using bank account as source of funds. That seems high. Furthermore, all my Coinbase transaction fees are made with the transaction itself, so if Coinbase made a separate transaction of $100 to charge you, I have no idea why that would happen. I think we're missing information.

I'd download a car if that were an option. But buying with Bitcoin will work great until then.

Safer why/how?
I signed up for Gemini and it seems cool. But you have to wait for your money to be transferred into the exchange first before you can spend it, which takes DAYSSSSSS.
