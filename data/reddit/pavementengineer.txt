Yes I'm sure it is, likely what I would use to cash out too. What do you use for buying then if you don't mind me asking?  Coinbase was my second option but their fees are too high now and I noticed that transferring to my wallett costs much more than quadrigacx as well 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:08:07
Can someone explain if this going to keep happening every time the shorts are expiring.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:51:26
I think this is the best advice, particularly when I can't till which Bitcoin related news is even reliable.  In the same day you see articles warning of collapses to $1000 and another saying it will be going to 50k by the end of the year. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:09:27
So what, every time the futures are expiring the price will drop 30% and then go back up? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:31:05
I get the theory but assuming that this theory is true, would that mean that this would keep happening every time futures are about to expire.  I.e. bull run up to the date, crash, repeat?  Wouldn't that make it too predictable? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:37:41
How do you mean reversing the process.  They can just buy it again and repeat the same.  If they start buying now they'll get a cheaper rate, spike it up to whatever let's say 19k again.  Start selling, make a killing off that, and then make more money in shorting it.  
If this is what regulation is preventing then why do we want to keep it unregulated.  I'm still fairly new so trying to understand 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:33:29
Yes that was my understanding as well, that you don't need to own it.  But what do I know.  
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:02:14
Goes back to the same point, can't they just keep doing this then.  And why Bitcoin, why not just do this with stocks as well.  The theory can apply to any kind of investment that can be shorted.

Quadrigacx has been disappointing lately with transferring money into to purchase coins.  All their transfer methods are down except for interac which doesn't seem to work for me because I have a visa debit and none of the major banks I spoke to seem to offer a debit card that is not cobadged.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:46:32
What if I rip my head off and stick my dick in the blender.  Would that work? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:20:34
Can't seem to fund the account with $$ for a while now.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:19:54
Their funding options have all gone down.  Felt like buying today and couldn't fund my account through any of the 3 options.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:18:26
Yes you are right, I knew I should have just either bought it all at once and if not just keep buying $500 per day or per week until I was out.  The mistake I made was keep buying $500 per day when it was going up steadily and when it spiked, I panicked and bougt around $2000 worth at the high point.  If i had just followed the strategy and bought $500 yesterday and again today, it wouldnt be so bad.  Right now, the bulk of my bitcoin was bought in at $19500.  Wouldnt be the worst thing in the long term, but I should have just kept a calmer head.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:57:48
Really wish I had some funds this morning.  Tried to transfer some quickly but quadrigacx is backed up with transfer requests, couldn't do anything 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:18:33
Yes you are right.  But I had committed to spending about $6k on btc when i started last week, and decided to go $500 per day.  Now I wish I had just dumped it all in at once when it was at 15k.  would have made my life easier.  I still have about $1500 of that 6k, a part of me just wants to spend it right now but then if it drops, I wont have any more money to take advantage of (I have more money, but 6k is all i can risk at this point).
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:18:57
This is copied from the funding page that I see when I log in:
Interac e-Transfer	Min $2,000CAD - Max $5,000CAD	$10,000CAD	Next Business Day	2% + $5CAD	required
I believe you may be referring to Interac Online which is different than Interac E-Transfer:
INTERAC® Online	Min $50CAD - Max $2,000CAD	$4,000CAD	Instant  	1.5%, Min $5CAD	required
I cannot use interac online as my Debit card has the Visa logo, i tried this already.  I have to go do the e-transfer through  my bank, and then input the amount i transferred on the quadriga website and it shows up the next business day.  This one did not show up because I could not submit the request on their website after sending it through my bank account as the amount is less than the minimum.  It has been taken out of my bank account though and i got confirmation that they received it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:52:00
I am that guy, haven't sold anything yet though.  When I bought it I told myself id give it at least one full year.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:06:35
Understood, thanks for the clarification 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:33:04
Oh my god thank you so much it finally worked.  I've been freaking out for the last 2 hours.  Thanks again.
I actually just want to disable the 2fa now but it won't let me.  I'll try and see if I can work it out , seems like more trouble than it's worth. 
Thanks again so much.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:35:51
I use quadrigacx and have had a great experience so far.  Could be improved but I think it's still the best option for Canadians 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:18:08
Ok thanks.  It still says pending so I am hoping it comes through eventually, I suppose I am just a little surprised its taking this long as the transfer through quadriga went through right away.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:59:16
Thank you it appreciate it.  I just downloaded mailvelope, apparently I needed an extension to decrypt the message.  Now that I have that, and I open the email, I am getting an error that says : "no private key found for this message.  Required private key IDs: ........"
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:23:49
not really, its less than 6% of my overall savings, im just not used to this much volatility.  Ive always been more a mutual fund person.  i was debating to buy at 17k and only bought like $100 worth.  woke up in the morning and saw $20,400 and my heart sank.  Cursed myself and bought it not wanting to make the same mistake again.  Next morning, down to 18k.  I dont know how you guys do this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:33
You'll be fine.  Just buy more now that's it's cheaper, if you can.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:12:34
Beauty thanks.  It was the "withdraw" part of quadriga that I wasn't sure about. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:38:27
I have Gmail, can I make it work with that? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:18:08
I went into the "Receive" menu in the ledger app and it generated a "bitcoin" address.  I sent it to that.  The first one came through and i sent it to the same address again.  The second one didnt come through.  When i went back to the receive menu again, there was a new "bitcoin" address.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:44:23
Haha understood.  No need to though, I'm a HODL'er till I die.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:40:06
Not an expert on anything to do with economy or Bitcoin but I've been thinking about this and I can't see how they could ban it now that there's almost a quarter of a trillion bucks invested in it.  Also, the different governments would have to agree on it. One of them banning it won't work.  I can see it being regulated but making it illegal to use, not sure if thats something they could achieve.  If they wanted to do that, they probably should have done that years ago.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:40:18
ive been buying everyday for past 5 days.  About $500 a day.  But then yesterday it jumped up so much and I panicked and thought that I should start buying more quantity (it went from 17k to 20k $CAD overnight).  I bought 500 at 17 and then didnt want to lose more and bought $2000 worth at 19 - 20.  Now its down to 18 and I dont know what I want to do.  Part of me wants to buy more and a part of me feels like it will go down so i should just sell half and buy again when it dips a bit more.  this is too difficult, i know everyone keeps saying just put it in your wallet and forget but im losing my mind.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:42
Transfer it where?  I transferred from the exchange to the wallett and didn't pay anything.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:20:42
I should mention the first transaction that went through successfully was through quadriga and the second one that failed was through coinbase.  Coinbase still says transaction pending so maybe it is still up in cyberspace.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:10:27
Can someone explain to a newbie the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash.  Why are both sides claiming to be the real Bitcoin.  What's the point of arguing over this.  I agree, it should matter why you got in but I can't understand how a new person is supposed to choose which one to invest one.  I feel like the old investors decided to pick a side at the fork and are loyal to it, for a new person I have no idea who to believe 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:48:27
Probably ties in best with my situation thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:18:47
Lol this is pretty funny.  I haven't invested in cash at all, I'm all in for bitcoin.  I literally just found out by Bitcoin cash today and yes I'm second guessing what I did and trying to understand the difference.  I don't get the outbursts like yours.  I have never posted in r/BTC you can check if you like.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:30:20
I am new to Bitcoin and got a ledger nano s.  THe addresses it generated were segwit by default.  My fees for transferring from the exchange to my wallet were 25c per transaction.  I don't even know if that was because of segwit but I wasn't really sure what large fees everyone was talking about.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:41:08
Thanks for the phone number I'll try calling them tomorrow.  I've been looking for a number for a while, couldn't find it anywhere on their website 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:10:48
Ah ok this is what I was looking for.  I thought withdraw was more for withdrawing money after you sell but I can see how it can be used for Bitcoin too.  Thanks.  Should've figured this one out myself . 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:49:54
I agree.  I'm gonna watch a day or 2 and decide. The second it gets around 10.5 I'm going in 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:21:18
How slow is a while?  A few hours or days? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:48:18
Thank you for your patient replies.  I can only imagine how ridiculous us noobs sound.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:48:49
This is my biggest fear.  I've waited long enough, always talked myself out of it.  Now I'm basically a click away from finally doing it and I don't wanna hold off in the hope of a dip that may never come.  Onc I buy, I'm in it for the long haul, in which case it wouldn't matter significantly whether I got it Umar 9k or 11.5k.  if I was putting in 100k then would matter but not in smaller amounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:33:24
Ok thanks for your input.  As someone new, I find both sides making similar arguments.  A part of me just wants to buy a little bit in both but I'll see.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:17:47
Hahaha.  Good one.  My favourite one was the Braveheart one though, can anyone link that ?  
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:56:20
It's been a lot of fun.  I keep hearing about the lightning network, saw some demos and looks amazing.  And buying the hardware wallett was a great decision, prevents me from doing anything stupid 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:40:09
This is partly why I think it's great to have some people join the party late.  I bought in at $13000 (cad).  There is no way in hell I'm selling if it gets near there.  It's hit 25 k and even if it drops I would want to wait for it to go back up before I even consider selling.  Not everybody would share my opinion though,I'm sure lots of people who bought at 13 k would consider selling around 15k if it starts dropping. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:20:39
No I did set up the 2fa myself.  I just didn't realize it would be like this.  I thought they would send you an e-mail verification or something, didn't know there would encrypted emails.
After signing up for 2fa, I went to igolder.com and it apparently generated private and public keys for me.  I entered the public key in the quadriga account.  I have the private key associated with that, but Im not sure if that's the key I'm supposed to be using.  And if it is, where do I enter it? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:02:02
If I transfer from my wallett to yours, who am I paying the fees to? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:52:00
If Bitcoin becomes a mainstream currency, isn't this a very serious concern?  
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:16:37
Just a follow up question.  In general, a software wallet is safer than keeping on an exchange correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:22:08
Is there potential that one of the chains would be eventually be considered the dominant one and the other would be either phased out or forced to revert to the other.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:03:34
Yes I agree.  I saw a post from a newbie looking for advice as he's looking to start buying tomorrow.  I mentioned that he might want to look at the difference between Bitcoin and bcash before he invests and my comment got deleted.  I didn't even take sides, just told him he should be informed.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:15:59
I went into the link that says "receive" and it generated an address for me.  I sent some to it from the exchange and received it.  Then I sent some more and it hasnt come through yet.  When I went back to the "receive" menu, the address had been change (i am assuming because I already used the first one).  So not sure what happened.  I am hoping I get it, I was able to put in $250 when it was at $13,000 and it went up to $400 and I was hoping to put it aside
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:29:33
How much of a dip? 9k? 10k? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:59
As someone new myself who didn't know about, I would really get to the bottom of this Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash debacle and decide for yourself which you think is wiser.  I invested in Bitcoin three weeks ago and right now I am not too sure what is going on.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:30:05
before anyone says anything, Ive already edited parts of the message so that is not the original verification code i received.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:49:36
Ok i don't know if this gonna sound dumb but I don't think I have a private key (yet?).  Is this something I'm supposed to get from quadriga?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:04:34
Yes I get that, I'm all for figuring out ways to lower fees so it can be used that way.  It's not there yet though so I don't have a problem waiting till it does and just leaving my crypto in a safe place until then.  
It's Christmas man, why you gotta bring everyone down? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:15
I use quadrigacx so didn't have that experience.  Is it only coinbase that's the concern?  I used coinbase at the start to buy a small amount of Bitcoin ($250 worth).  They only charged me $2 for buying it.  When I moved it to my wallett they charged $18.  I didn't care much as that was my first transaction and afterwards I started using qyadrigacx and didnt have that problem.  So is it only coinbase charging that kind of fees?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:41
Thanks, still slightly confused though.  My transaction through qyadrigacx was instant and cost nothing.  It was in my wallett within seconds.  Through coinbase it was $18 and took a full day.  What's up with that? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:06:07
2 hours later and it still says pending.  Does it usually take this long?
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:14:45
Isn't that kind of contradictory though.  For it to be in print another forty years, it HAS to survive another decade, and now that means it will last another fifty?  Sounds like this is saying "if it's lasted x years, it can be expected to last another x years, unless it doesn't" 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:11:46
Thanks, I've been wary of that and usually verify whatever advice I get from another source.  Hope you didn't get burned too bad 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:01:29
Can everyone chill, I'm not going to actually sell.  Just wanted an excuse to say hodl
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:00:41
Thank you, it says currently I can purchase $250 worth per week until I reach $500 at which point it will go up.  And I think if I verify using my passport it will go up as well so I will do that. 
So in your opinion, I don't need an exchange, I can just keep using this coinbase app and this should be sufficient ? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:46:54
Thank you so much.  So in summary, I should keep coinbase as the exchange to buy the bitcoins but get a wallett to store it.  The article you sent is alarming, I suppose there is no guarantee it won't happen again?
What exactly do you mean by 12-24 word seed.  And how can I increase my limit to buy more Bitcoin, it's stuck at 250 per week right now and says I can buy more once I have a few transactions.  Can I use multiple exchanges to speed up buying (I suppose I will be paying more in transaction fees).
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:35:05
Ok great so I will keep using coinbase as the exchange.  I will purchase a wallett to store my money.  I won't be using any for transcations, pretty much everything will be treated as a savings account.  
I mean I would be upset if I lost the money but this money is separate from my down payment fund, my retirement fund and the education fund I have for my daughter.  I was going to use it to pad my down payment in a couple of years, it's just sitting in a low interest savings account right now so I guess I am ok with risking it.  Might end up buying $1000 worth every week when my limit  goes up, i am no expert but it might see a slight dip in the short term.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:55:27
Now I'm down $2 .  Better sell before I lose any more right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:59:28
In all seriousness, this subreddit has been a huge help with educating me on how to go about the process.  I first heard about it in 2011 and considered buying it every year but didn't really bother researching or anything and gave up thinking it was too complicated.  1 week here has taught me so much, and while I'm a long way from fully understanding what I'm doing it feels great to be a part of this.  Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer the questions that have likely been asked here a million times
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:48:19
I fully agree actually but I've always just debated about buying it and never pulled the trigger.  Have my savings set aside for house, retirement, education and figured wth, let's just start buying a little.  I do have around 10k that I was waiting to invest somewhere but will likely wait for a small dip before using that for Bitcoin too.  I'm only using money that I consider spare at this point, I either take a risk on it or will likely end up going on a vacation with it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:50:11
Further to this, i just spent the last week trying to fully understand how the buying process works and once I realized it wasn't as complicated as I initially expected, I just had to buy a little to kind of get the ball rolling.  Not getting carried away but I'm still really new so any advice is appreciated.
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:17:44
Didn't believe you when I first read it.  But I just checked and you're right.  It's odd though, it was there a couple hours ago 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:45:08
If you can afford to lose it, leave it there.  If not take it out.  You can also cash out half of it and leave some there to minimize some losses and leave potential for future growth. 
Ive personally stopped listening to other people and decided I will hold and buy smaller quantities over time.  Treating it like any of my other investments.  But it and forget, set up autodeposit for small buys and check back in a year.  Hopefully it's still there. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:02:48
I want to see if he Braveheart one again 
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:01:14
He converted pennies to $20,000 so yes he did do ok.  Bitcoin would not be where it is today if everyone had held on.  Smartest are the people who traded some away at various points to realize gains.  Most of the ones who actually held on from the early days either forgot about it or forgot how to access them and didn't care coz they spent so little on them.
