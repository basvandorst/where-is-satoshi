When its confirmed you get the exact amount he sent you in Bitcoin. Amounts of coin do not change with the price. only the value of the coins change. so if you wait for a tx in a rising price and the sender messed up and sent it out with too low fee, which results in the tx being stuck for some time, you are lucky. you can always experience the negative with a falling price.  
But you always get your bitcoin that has been sent to you if he does not double spend (research it) to drop the unconfirmed tx and resend it with the new amount. Its the fault of the sender who did not take enough care of looking up the best fee for quick transfering, so you don't even have to pay back anything, that is how it works currently. But dont sue me if I am wrong on the last paying back thing, do your own thing.

just doublespend it. export your privatekey, import it to another wallet (electrum or bitcoin core, dont know if it works with multibit) and from there you have the balance ready again to send it out with a higher fee, leading to the old tx getting dropped. has been proven to be the fastest method around. 100% works with this method and those two wallets and is fast.
also the new bitcoin core RC does support this by default. using the tx accelerator, which is being spammed everywhere as the only and best solution and as a funny coincidence it's the first one being commented into almost every stuck-tx thread, takes way longer. proven fact. double spending get's it sent out with a few clicks in under 10 minutes, even faster. No matter with which wallet you have sent it out in the first place! tx accelerator = unknown waiting time. can take hours or days. making it not a solution at all. ("One solution" &lt; not true) 
  
same what i posted in the other thread. same working solution.

Technically Gox Bitcoin did get sold. When withdrawals got halted, the goxcoins got sold as an iou gambling thing.  
I may forgot this detail but I think when withdrawals where stopped, you still could trade on Gox within the pairs around while getting fucked by the crazy rollercoaster.  
  
The price does count as an ATH. See my other comment in this thread

said a *lot* of people buying at the mtgox high years ago too. most lost all coin, some pulled out and sold early with lots of losses, some still in profit, and some needed to wait YEARS to sell in some *OK*-area again. see my other post in this thread please.
@_date: 2017-02-26 05:31:52
but would you have held onto them until now or sold for &lt;$20? No one knew the future value, except a few that suspected a five figure usd price. Else everyone would have held and no one would have sold, leading to the market not moving at one point and the future price not happening.  
I am waiting for threads in years stating "I owned 1 BTC, and sold it for thousand dollars years ago. Could have been a trillionaire now."

investing all you have saved into bitcoin betting on luck not to lose it, is doomed to fail. the attitude thinking like this can flag selling at the wrong point too and doing lots of false things you might do. some people with this base attitude should not even think about doing such a big risky thing, it seems like you reflect a strong gambling attitude, which is dangerous. some things can be read out of such small amounts of words.        
not that i dont respect what you do. you will get into problems with this kind of thing sooner or later. not even talking about taxes if you get into panic and do big trades with huge gains and losses. you produce a mountain of paperwork you can't see through, producing more costs for someone doing the tax. also if bitcoin's price swings need to be taxed some day if you don't even convert to fiat, you pretty much could be fucked.   
if bitcoin goes straight up towards 5 figures with $10k as the next top to reach, you might gain if you held through strong. if not, it can take YEARS to ever reach your buypoint again, if the last cycle just repeats downwards from now on.  
  
and if bitcoin goes even just &gt;2000 dollars where you sell, you will hate yourself forever if it goes to 10,000, 20,000 or even 100,000 years later. also block halvings come fast, it's basicly just *a few years*. just as fast as bitcoin's price can fall and can stay low forever because of law regulation. it can fall slowly over years with no new profit selling point or can fall fast.  
shit can hit the fan within &lt;24h, because Bitcoin is not more than the first real **experiment** in this technological category executed this way, followed by other alternative coins. and the mining part is already in centralized hands - which is a flaw. if the cryptoalgo breaks tomorrow, you can consider yourself fucked quick. very quick. even if you are lucky and still have your coin balance, you might then have 0.0000265 EUR worth of coin, which can be worth 0 EUR shortly after that within minutes or hours. and cryptoalgos have been broken all the time - it's just the matter of *time*, made by human hand and will be broken by human hand.   
  
  
it's the big amount you invested, where you are **not trying to lose**, according to how i read your topic title. which is basicly the same as taking all the money you have, going into a casino and doing 1 bet all in with a game that can take a few days, a few weeks, a few months, a few years and is over until you can't take it anymore. you have chosen a very hard und unintelligent way of investing. please don't do more stupid like going to an exchange and using leverage resulting in letting the exchange see your high leverage position and chopping it away of you every time you add more and try to make losses back. or even do all in on that. do not do this.      
   
  
you maybe should have invested just a few percent of it which represents what you are willing to lose anytime, which does not impact you and your family's money at all if it's gone. with this investment you put the financial future and base to the highest possible risk.  
if a flaw in the protocol is being found, it can also be worth not enough to pay the next rent tomorrow. or you have it hacked away. even storing such amount of coin is highly complicated for long term, you have fire, water, magnetism, thiefs (posting this with an account with your kind of history can make you trackable and a target, also for ransomtactics of all kinds), future compatibility and much more as your side enemies, depending on how you stored it. the more you have and if it also is nothing you can lose quick, the more you should take care of security - long or short term.     
think about all the possible things, it can ruin your and your family's life forever, making you the person of fault for investing it away. still wish you good luck and glad not to be you to be blunt. if i would be you, i would have invested &lt;10k of your fiat money. 
also take this as my personal opinion and not as a trading- or investment advice, although it might sound as such here and there. these are "If I would be you"-opinions/-investmentcases, which I might have done. this is a public message board about opinions and not even a trading and investment advice related one. just saying.  
think about what you did and take decisions on your own responsibility. wanted to tell you some worst case scenarios and open your eyes. thanks.

It is. $1242. But some are ignoring that fact just to scream ATH. Because they say "Gox was manipulated" while ignoring the fact that chinese exchanges manipulated the shit out of the price, which got us where we are until they recently lost the lead, which might continue until the end of the month. Without the chinese price manipulation we would probably sit way lower now, who knows. Fact is most are ignoring old MtGox manipulation while favoring the recent ones. Stupidity.  
The price is cool but there still is some missing for a *real* ATH.  
Do not worry about getting downvoted, regular denial behaviour here - i will get downvoted too.

Also aren't creditors planned to be paid out in fiat, according to a fixed price anyway and not in BTC?  
Getting the original amount of coin back would be highly impossible.

mining with your pc hardware to a pool is getting you next to nothing. remember you get your bitcoinamounts in most cases if a specific mined amount has been reached, can be anything from 0.01 or 0.001 bitcoin.    
you can use bitcoin mining calculators online. you won't get &gt;1gh/s with one gpu, maybe 400-700mh/s. it can ruin your gpu quick.  
you will make about &lt;$5 per year depending on the hardware. you can better bet on luck finding a block with solo mining without any pool and *maybe* get lucky and receive a full 12.5 btc block reward + fees. that is possible with every computer/asic and can take anywhere from a few seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years to find a block. you could also never find one before your hardware breaks. ignore people saying solo mining is impossible without costly asic mining hardware, anyone can do it with any hardware and a block can be found anytime - it's pretty much random and depends on lots of luck, if you only want to find 1 block. big mining asic hardware are made for getting lots of share rewards in big pools or finding more than 1 block with solo mining because they hash faster. these are the costly hardware pieces people recommend. i solo mine with low level asics (usb block erupters) and i won't stop, not caring a bit if this takes my whole life to find a block.  
  
you can use guiminer, cgminer, bfgminer they are free and there are also many more around but these are the oldest, trusted and still working software miners to get your hardware mining. or you can just decide to not mine with your pc. rewards for solo are the highest, big or smaller pool mining are way lower because you produce low amount of shares. i would not mine with my pc hardware again, which is why i use old cheap asic usb block erupters - gpu mining ruins hardware too quick if you do not watch the heat constantly.  
  
to set the software up: the pool websites always have detailed helpsites giving you all instructions. but you must register to the pool and set up a worker and a password, which the mining software will use to connect and identify with. if all fails you may want to check out other software. still fails? msg the pool admins for help. hitting google for tutorials is also good because mining is being done since lots of years - many websites with noob friendly tuts.
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:57:38
Still a thing that can not be talked out of: Other exchanges followed the price. So the price is a legit ATH.

The fact that the twins are holding a *major amount of coin*, which *could* harm/manipulate the market in various ways, really could be a thing leading to rejection. I bet this will be their own mistake of holding just too much *control in form of coin* in a deflationary cryptocurrency.  
  
Also Professor Bitcorn is very salty because he was still waiting to buy for $10 lol  
The fact he made such an idiotic straight prediction out of his ass [link:  should disqualify him commenting on the ETF topic and all future BTC topics anyway. The only concern I have are the amount of coin, some things he wrote about are just not true or well known etc etc etc etc. He tried his best, corn bless him.

There *will* be many more news to justify price move manipulations, the only solution would be delisting all of these exchanges, so they can FUD around within their own country and sell into it themselves while all other exchanges can finally go on and let Bitcoin's price develop.

This is what I wanted to recommend too. Not only since other wallets (local ones for your computer) can process swiping such wallets or parts of it, but also because of security. Your pile of funds are big and not supposed to be stored in an online wallet. Please read on up about safely setting up cold storage to send it to. Before sending it there, you can deduct a small amount for future spendings and send that to a hot wallet.  
I played with hot wallets w local software wallets containing hundreds or thousands of transactions and some have problems if it goes into the thousands, it just won't sync anymore or shows incorrect data. Please be aware of that. Like someone here recommended, for hot wallets consider swiping them after usage and then use a new address. For security and if you manage to gather thousands of transactions there too.
  
Hardware wallets are good too, even better. Take care of your coin, I recommend trezor, not only because they are longer around since anyone else and therefor trusted as hell, they got really impressive security features built into this device. But not trying to advertise it, please read on the internet about all this yourself and make your decision. Something different than storing coin on an online wallet.

People holding such amounts will not hold forever. This wealth is going to flow back with all other circulating coins again. Some sell earlier, some later.  
Thinking more about what future brings, can lead to interesting facts you think about. Some that can be a catastrophe to Bitcoin, some that can be just good for holders.  
We will see how everything will develop.

You would need to check these recommendations: 
  
for all scripts and websites asking for seeds and keys: download them and run offline. also import private keys to another wallet client offline, send your coins to a newly generated address, right when you go online. to be more safe you can first use a phone's wallet for going online and send it away from there to a new wallet address where you did not expose the private key. exposing your private key is dangerous.  
  
if the seed works for electrum too: i don't know, try.

there are many other ways. please decide for yourself what might be the best. just handle your private key securely. i only wanted to give you the url and tell how i might have done it. don't want to be responsible for any damage.  
but i think you will get it  
the safest method i like is having a gap where the privatekey was exposed on one computer and then imported into another device and sending coins from there. a phone wallet works good to. getting around to gambling with privatekey exposure has many ways. you also may not know if you have malware for stealing coins on your computer which constantly scan for privatekeys. decide for yourself

We heard this a lot of times years ago. Things always repeat. In the end people regret that need to buy higher later or cover their regret by switching to being anti Bitcoin.  
People that hold know about the usual up and downs. It's nothing knew and if one is into holding then the risk is or should be known before doing so. Nothing to do with regrets. Holding is not having Bitcoin for a week.

I think this might be wrong calling it like that. There could have been lots of *normal* people who got talked into investing it without knowing they are *criminals*. Besides lots of others who *knew*.  
  
Bitcoin is the solution against any banks. But you can experience the same. You buy Bitcoin to use it, which is investing too, and then loose your invested money because the price is going down. Could also go upwards. Investing is risky in general. With Bitcoin not everything driving the price is normal too, everything has people behind exchanges, *hacks*, attacks, FUD spreading or other things. We are experiencing it every week.  
  
But I agree in using Bitcoin to ditch usage of banks. The thing soon is that banks will issue their own blockchains. We will see what time brings. Could be the monetary system's horror or a good thing. I bet on a horror and them making bad headlines again by using blockchain to gain more control over people's money and do bad things, instead of using it like it's meant to be.

You import your privatekey to Bitcoin Core 0.14 and use it's bumpfee feature in the console or just import your privatekey to electrum and spend it again with a higher fee. Faster than all other solutions and free. Both solutions simply broadcast your transaction again with a higher fee which you can set. **It's like having a second try** to send it out again, but as said with a higher fee than you did the first time. You can do it with all unconfirmed transactions.

But what about compromising future firmware deployments on said devices? I'd be careful as hell.

Still no idea what people got with their "crash" and "bubble".
Bitcoin crashed upwards. It still is up.

**Back up your wallet file located in your User folder &gt; AppData &gt; Roaming &gt; Electrum, before you do anything!**
  
Yes, you can just import your private key.
Start electrum, go to file &gt; New/Restore &gt; standard wallet &gt; Use public or private key &gt; enter your private keys (or paste them, one per line is good), then you just imported the wallets from your .csv file.  
Make sure to write down your seed somewhere safe on paper or something when creating your next wallet.
Or just import the keys, click the seed icon on the lower right and it should display the current seed. (Might be a new one, or your old one - no idea.)

Aren't "deleted" things recoverable too?  
What if they did "delete it the wrong way"?  
You could delete a log file and recover it within a day easily.  
But you could also delete a log file and make sure it can not be recovered.  
  
In your technical space I am pretty much incompetent, but there still are some points where they have made mistakes.  
  
edit: again, found the answer below. nvm

While you are saying satan: What about the return of Gox now?  
Did Karpeles sell everything? Does he hold? Did he vanish to a different planet?

Someone who would know what has to be done, would have mixed them right away.  
And maybe mixed them also for a long time, with this stack of money.   
Chances are there you could somehow get in touch with the JoinMarket operators, offer them a bounty if they hand you over the IP address or anything else that could lead to identification. If they were extremely stupid, they didn't use TOR and if you are lucky the JoinMarket keeps logs on the website. (No experience with this website, can't tell) 
The real name and contact data of the website are hidden and protected by WhoisGuard, but usually those guys advertise and take care of their websites reputation on public forums. Which is a way to get in contact with them. If it really has been made on JoinMarket. No matter if it's P2P or not, someone started it up and did advertise it when it started. You could start searching on bitcointalk and deepweb ("darknet") related forums. I'm sure there could be a slim chance to have success with this, worth a try.  
  
Next thing would be to find out if those coins have been sent to exchange wallets at some point (partially or all of them), there are some ways to analyse where mixed coins have been gone. Mixing doesn't make coins untraceable, it just makes them harder to trace. So contacting an exchange would be an option too. Whatever the exchange it may be. Chance of stupidity of those thieves is still there. Try all you can.
  
Just my 2 cents.  
edit: just read a comment way below mine with more details. nevermind. but still consider doing some more and deeper investigation on your own. Also if it still was some kind of inside job, consider giving these details to the police to check if someone just got noticeable wealthy and had left the country without plans to come back or anything. Or if someone who could have been involved in such an inside job recently opened foreign bank accounts with balances matching the outgoing coins of the last wallet. Or is stupid enough to buy a house, boat and what not in a short amount of time with suddenly appearing insane wealth and no way to declare where it came from without doxxing the original coinsource. Whatever, with this amount stolen, do anything you can.

See my first comment on this thread (the longer one). If they have shown signs of not exactly knowing what they are doing the chances are there that they did a lot of mistakes in between.

Scroll up a bit more, someone linked you blockchain forensic websites where you can hire someone who knows how to do it.  
Almost all big stacks of coins that have been hacked have been traced to hell and back since forever. It is possible to trace. It only depends if tracing them can lead to information you can use to recover them. Try it.

God bless awesome technology  
Greetings to Mr Hearn by the way, thanks for the worthless dead tech you contributed to!

No, I'm sorry.
