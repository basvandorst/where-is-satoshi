He was hired as a scout, not a guide. i.e. go ahead of the group/party and survey the area.

He can’t handle logic and fact, no point in reasoning with him

I am right. If you’ve read the book or watched the movie, you’d know he was hired on as a scout. Tom Hardy even refers to him as “scout” twice in the film.

Get over what? Being right? Movie is based off the book, he’s a scout in both. Sorry I corrected you

lol right, my made up bs. He says “look at me scout” and grabs his rifle. He also says that Glass was out hunting when they were attacked by Indians instead of scouting the area like he was supposed to be doing. But, no you’re right, your Wikipedia page source is correct, not the film itself or the book it’s based off of.
