Can we please be clear on what happened with Ethereum.  It wasn't so much the hardfork itself that caused so much controversy, it was that the hardfork **retroactively modified the ledger** and essentially moved tokens without owning the private key to do so.  Even moreso, this was done not because of an error in Ethereum, but in a dapp **built on ethereum**.  The situation became much worse as it became clear the ridiculous conflict of interest within the community leaders.  
It was not simply the hardfork brought ETC/ETH to where it is now.  It was *why* the hardfork was done in the first place.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:59:29
Yeah I don't blame the organizers too much.  Yeah they could have done due diligence, but for someone who has no idea about this kind of stuff, it can be hard to know whats good or bad.  I mean, that's why Onecoin has gotten so successful, yet not primarily with bitcoiners.

Without going into details, are your systems segmented enough to mitigate damage from even the most vicious zero days?  A large possible payoff makes it worthwhile for attackers to invest in these exploits because they can easily multiply their investment by insane amounts.

Regardless of what you think, I'm just trying to explain the mindset of someone who didn't want the Ethereum hardfork.  But I think we can both agree on that the fork in Ethereum is much different than the kinds of forks being proposed in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-01 05:58:54
I don't think it was most dire of circumstances. If Ethereum truly is as revolutionary as it's community believes, then it will survive even with the hacker getting his coins. They will eventually end up back in the hands of other users. What do you consider dire?
also, why wasn't a softfork sufficient?

No, they fucked up the softfork.  It is possible to do it with a softfork, they just fucked up designing it.  The real reason they hardforked isn't because it's safer to HF, but rather because HFing is the only way to restore the funds stolen.

The current reason businesses are not using it in this manner is due to the high volatility which introduces additional risk.  Once the price begins to level out, the margin for risk is lowered and businesses would benefit from using Bitcoin for corporate transactions.

I highly doubt that Satoshi expose himself in such an obvious way, especially buying something as commonly misused as card reader.  It being in 2013 makes it even more suspect.  I bet it was a guy using it as a joke and the fact that its a PO box emphasizes the possibility of a drop address. It's probably a guy using it as a joke, because there's no way someone as security conscious as Satoshi would expose himself to a third party.  
But anything is possible.
EDIT:  Apparently this order is NOT for a card reader, but rather an FPGA miner sold by this site.  Even so, my doubts about an order being made in 2013 still stands.  I'm still banking on someone using the GMX email as a joke

1) Theoretically it should be every 10 minutes but since the difficulty (How hard it is to find a block) is only changed every 2 weeks, the time in-between the changes is shorter because of the addition of hashing power.
2) Some clients use 'change addresses' where it works like this:
Address 1 has a balance of 1 BTC wants to send 0.25 BTC to a friend at address 2.  What the client does is sends 0.25 to address 1 and 0.75 to a new address 3, which is in the same wallet at address 1 and is done to prevent address reuse.  The block chain still sees this as a 1 BTC transaction but the true value of the transaction is 0.25

In the case of a typical fractional reserve system, all USD deposits go into the Gox bank account which then pays out to those who would like to withdraw USD from Gox.  Thus, as long as the USD withdrawal volume is less than the total in the bank account, the system can still function with less than the total balance of all accounts. 
However, Mt.Gox got notoriously slow with USD withdrawals, although that was speculated to be because of legal issues rather than fraudulent activity (At least prior to February 2014).

Ok, but I think the key factor is the difference in value in usd. its as simple as that. Let's be real, ethereum has much more money and resources behind it 2 years into it compared to btc. 
The thing about an ethereum hardfork is that it isnt correcting anything in the the ethereum network, only an error in a dapp. with the bitcoin hardfork, it was an error in the protocol. There's nothing wrong functionally with the ethereum network, but various factors threaten its future, such as the theft affecting public perception.

The difference between this subreddit and others is this is often used as a central authority on bitcoin discussion.  Many assume this is an official bitcoin hub and I think that censorship is a responsible way of managing this subreddit.

I do however understand the argument of simply taking the discussion elsewhere as to not clog up this subreddit

Here's my take: You participated in business with a company that defaulted.  Yes they did get "robbed" a while ago, but the reason you don't have your coins is because MtGox did not have the coins to repay its members.  You were just as much a member of the site as anyone else.

Well imagining there was a system in place to detect for transactions they never created, under the system I described in the main post, one could instantly force the deadman's switch by sending out two arbitrary transactions from different addresses.

Its a little difference because the sole purpose of mining is to take advantage of property that is not yours, and there is no agreement beforehand. They should implement at the bare minimum a "check terms and conditions" popup beforw beginning.

It's not in the store anymore, so I wonder if it's gotten taken care of.  Do you know what the deal with the string of numbers is?  That's where I would imagine worse code is.  Regardless, there should be pool worker login info somewhere, or some sort of mining configuration.  I doubt it's solo mining or he has his own pool set up.

I believe there are many computers out there with unsufficient cooling systems (many laptops, some desktops). I also believe there is such a thing as natural cpu degradation, albeit it is much slower when not overclocked.

When you are trading on localbitcoins as a means of turning profit it generally isnt a good idea to buy above market price, so a rational person acting within their own interests would not buy above market price (which is quite rare, its not like everyone is doing it) unless external forces are present. 
Its pretty clear youve never taken a basic economics class so i dont blame you. I blame your parents.

FIRST 5 CHARACTERS IS NOT SAFE
Generating an equivalent 5 char vanity address can be done in seconds using your gpu.  It is trivial for malware to detect a btc address on the clipboard, generate a similar looking address, and replace it on the spot.  
I would check to the 8th char, but more is always better.  The limiting factor is once you cannot generate these addresses on the fly.  However for big transactions your eyes should scan the entire thing.  What's more important, 5 seconds of your life, or all your money.
I think it would be cool to have some standardized procedurally generated image next to addresses on websites and wallets.  That way once you paste it into you wallet, it would be very apparent that the images are different.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:21:53
My current hypothesis is that the string of numbers was just webasm code, low level code implementable in browsers, which has the purpose of allowing the mining to take place at a higher efficiency than the equivalent crypto functions implemented in js

What?  I'm talking about how buying at above market price is typically a bad strategy. What i'm really asking is what market effects are causing to buy at a price thats higher than almost any other avenue of acquitting bitcoins. 
For this to be a good strategy, there would have to be something like:
* limited means of acquiring bitcoin for fiat in a particular country
* the lbc user is only buying btc as a higher price because he knows that there is demand for him to sell his bitcoins at a profit that is larger than the loss from buying above market price
* the lbc user is unable to move paypal stored balance through their banking system so the next best bet is to purchase bitcoin with it at a high price because they want liquid funds soon
* etc... there are many other reasons
To reiterate, im not calling the lbc user stupid for paying above market price, but one would assume that he is acting rationally and therefore there would be an external force that makes him want to pay more per btc than virtually any other mainstream dealer is charging to purchase btc through them. Im just asking what the reason behind it is, because he's been doing this for a while with great feedback
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:49:58
Hey buddy i know that it can be hard to be wrong especially when youre this deep into it, but i really hope that you can practice some humility and google the definition of the word trade. 
He was not selling at above market price, you stupid fuck. He's buying at above marketprice. On a normal exchange it would be impossible because it would automatically eat up ask orders. Let that be a sign that perhaps the economics would dictate that hes either a. A bad businessperson or b. External forces are making it advantageous to purchase at a price higher than what everyone else is selling it for.  Hes paying 5% above market price despite there being many many sellers offering it for lower than that. We're not talking one or two percent. We're talking about 1/20th above market while trading large volumes. 
Just think about it a little bit. It takes some people a little longer to get things and thats fine but typically they dont lash out before they understand the actual argument. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:16:26
Its just an interesting tidbit. Servers hosting websites are constantly creating crypto keys with each new person which can be cpu intensive, so they made a device/chip that offloads the crypto part and is designed solely for that reason.

@_date: 2017-09-18 09:00:11
I did find this
There are known transistor degradation mechanisms such as gate-oxide
breakdown and hot-electron effects that slowly change transistor
performance. This can slowly degrade timings for signals across chip
and eventually cause the chip to not work. Or it can result in a bit
flip, if it happens in the chip's cache.
Ultimately, the chip will slowly become less *capable*. That is,
instead of a 3.4G chip being able to run at 3650Mhz it will slowly be
able to run at 3600, then 3550, then 3500, etc... The end user
wouldn't notice since the chip is multiplier locked at 3.4G until it is
becomes unable to run at that speed and then it would act

Ive been saying this since 2013 but bitcoin is going to force the creation of actual simple protocols for having near bulletproof security in computing. Programming was never really designed for security and most people program with the sole intent of making it work. Its also hard to watch out for things you have no idea exist, like buffer overflows and heap spraying. 
Ledger, the hardware wallet manufacturer, is leading the physical security in computing scene. They all have secure hardware backgrounds and created a dev sdk that makes utilizing the stm32 secure element chip simple. I was one of the first people to use the sdk when it came out and the company couldnt have been more helpful. They opened a slack channel for development support and nicholas helped me with a few details on how to implement schnorr signatures, which i successully did with very little actual coding (you just enable the experimental flag when compiling the C secp256k lib). 
The ledger has many great security features, such as firmware attestation (checking integrity of firmware), secure element chip (which ledger and keepkey lack), can load multiple apps without each one accessing the data from other apps, and many more cool things. You can have multiple wallets too. The team is made up of genuine bitcoin people and is active on reddit a lot too and im sure he will respond if you ask a genuine question that isnt asked every day.

@_date: 2017-09-09 18:38:10
Its true. Trust me. I always get laughed at when i say i know the story behind it because obviously no one believes me, but trust me once you put the simple facts together it makes so much sense and theres lots of evidence. I didnt figure it all out on my own, i talked to a friend of mine who ill just say has been around since before 2009, and he gave me a quick rundown on it then i remembered all the evidence that makes this the most logical explanation. 
Do you really think that hal finney, who's life centered around cryptography and people had been discussing digital currency for a while. Everyone knew it would be cryptographic. So its definitely peculiar that he happened to receive the first transaction. Oh then satoshi drops off right as hal finney got sick. I know it plays up the myth of mysterious creator and shit but lets just look at the most obvious explanations here. 
Theres a nick szabo post out there that has him commenting about wanting people to get started on this project called bitgold which was very clearly an early version of bitcoin. So use your head. Theres a community of people from that cypherpunk mailing list who are a tight circle. They used pseudonyms often. Use your head. 
Theres another aspect that i cant reveal without getting into too much detail but its beautiful.

Do you think that the only additional feature of "custom transaction builders" is the ability to raise the fee?  There are additional features, such as in bc.info's case, ability to choose outputs and return addresses.  I agree it would be better if it gave a warning, the actions of OP were not the software's fault (I still have sympathy considering how easy it is to make that mistake).  I know everyone loves to shit on bc.info, but it really is very convenient to have the wallet stored server side.  I have never had an issue with it but I also don't keep more than I have to lose there.

I have been thinking about this ever since I heard the official story.  It is easy even for a competent person to use already existing software to:


Then they could


It's too easy, but surely, *surely* Wright must have said something to Gavin that strengthened (In Gavin's eyes) Wright's claims.
Perhaps Wright purchased access to the hacked satoshi GMX email (Hacked by a money hungry skid named lulzclerk/savaged) and used the early gavin emails to bamboozle Gavin.  
Regardless of whether he is Satoshi or not, Steven Wright is the king of bitcoin trolls, and also kind of a dick.

**Does anyone know if the deposit data for mtgox is available within the leaked documents?** (dates, amounts, possibly User Id's to help correlation)  It'd be interesting to see if we could track some of his coins. Even if the database doesn't have the bitcoin addresses, we can use the timestamp to find a deposit of that amount at that date and time. 
Another thing, is there any evidence of Craig actually mining?  Because I've seen people say that although he isn't satoshi, he was a very early adopter of the software and therefore mined a fairly sizable portion of coins. But these MtGox figures certainly don't tell the tale of even a moderately invested miner.  
There's also the possibility of him just playing around with reasonable amounts of bitcoin only every once in a while. He certainly wasn't a very active user of the exchange, so perhaps he kept his more sizable portion of coins in other places.

so far it seems (correct me if im wrong) that btc-e was only complicit in laundering the funds. however the posts by charlie, coindesk, and kyle all seem to state very clearly that btce hacked mtgox, whatever that means. if i were to say that, i would have to have information that directly links btc-e administrators with the breach of mtgox. 
what if they hacked mtgox and, realizing the difficulty of laundering such a large amount of btc, created btce to allow them to get their bitcoins out cleanly. the 2011 hack happened in march 2011 and btc-e bitcointalk announcement thread was in september of 2011. that would be a hell of a story.

You can infer those specific deposit addresses but you can't identify all of them unless there was a particular pattern of transactions that was unique to btc-e's deposit address to hot wallet process.  The question i'm asking is, assuming the stolen bitcoins were not sent directly from Address b to address c according to the descriptions above, how can you know that the address sending the coins to the hot wallet was not just a deposit address.
I assume the process went like this:
Addr A mtgox &gt; Addr B hacker &gt; addr c + d + e as the hacker moves the coins around a little &gt; addr X btc hotwallet.
I can't imagine he sent the coins directly from the address that directly received mtgox's bitcoins right into the btc hot wallet, that just seems dumb.  What i'm asking is how they identified the address that sent coins to the btc-e address as not a deposit address.

it is connected in lots of ways.  they even say it in the blog post linked in this post.  I have a feeling they are downplaying their connection too, because would you admit that you were best buds with btc-e after what happened?


offered BTC-e and their clients IT solutions for KYC and CDD procedures in accordance with the world’s best practices.
As I mentioned in my other comment in this post, verification on xbtce also verifies you on btc-e, so they definitely have at minimum a direct line of communication and at most access to a shared db of kyc info.  
[Here's btc-e's announcement of xbtce (archive.is)](
From that link:


There is very clearly a close relationship between the two and the OP blog post is the first time they play it down as much as they did. 
Simply google 
    site:btc-e.com xbtce.com 
to get a glimpse of the manner in which btc-e referred to xbtce.  But I think the simple fact that a single x added onto the beginning shows  more than a minor partnership.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:46:30
Y'all are delusional.  BTC-e was easily the biggest launderer of illegally gained bitcoin funds.  I would bet money on 80% of ransomware earnings made their way through btc-e. The people in charge of busting btc-e were not sitting at a round table smoking cigars.  There is an uncountable number of crimes committed and btc-e is the last step in all of them.  The reason is that there is a service out there with anonymous owners that is allowing people to bypass every single financial regulation put in place to stop crime, and it's happening in the light of day.  If they wanted to stop people form using bitcoin they would go after more than just the most illegal service there is.

How can they identify what is a customer deposit address?  For them to make that claim without having some sort of method of identifying deposit addresses, the coins must have been sent to the internal storage directly from the address that received the stolen funds.  Like this:
Address A Bitcoinica funds in bitcoinica's control &gt; Address B hacker moved coins out of bitcoinica &gt; Address C internal btc-e address
I assume by internal storage they mean the same address(es) that normal deposits go into?

So your logic is that it's okay to lie but correct yourself later?  Listen man, my only issue was that it didn't ask for any of that info until **after** I gave you Bitcoin.  I understand what is required to stay compliant and I have no issue with having to provide all of the info, but you should definitely ask for it *before you take my money*.  I accept full responsibility for mistyping my ssn, that's not what I was upset about.  
I was NEVER asked for my ID yesterday, the ID i gave you was from a while ago.  So don't go around saying that the reason is because I refused to give you my ID.  


Yes I got my coins back, but you did NO FURTHER VERIFICATION that the email came from me.  You realize it's possible to spoof emails?  What if someone had known about my situation and spoofed my email and gave you another address?  It's not good security standards, you should have confirmed it via text message or phone call, not by email!  
I just don't want anyone else to be in the situation I got put in, where you took my money *then* asked me for more info.  It's terrible customer experience, and regardless of my attitude, you should realize how it's very offputting for users to have their money delayed with no warning.  I actually don't fault you for your fees or anything, you have to make money and I understand that.  
Does that make sense?  I'm willing to put this aside as a misunderstanding, but there is no doubt that the "take money first ask verification later" process is very scummy.  There's a reason many other people chimed in as to how horrible the service is.  A good businessman would take the feedback and use it to create a better service.
The second time I called in, the customer service rep on the other side was very good and helpful, he even offered to expedite the application process.

I'm just letting you know that if you don't respond to this and have a good reason that excuses you from the points i made in my last post here, I will be creating another thread about you lack security protocol.  Bitcoiners must be warned against your company's incompetence.  There are many good bitcoin atm's in the city that have customer service that doesn't hang up on customers then lie about it.  If you truly have good reason for doing the things you did, I will seriously not post it.  But since I doubt I will get a response, which I take as you not having an answer, it is my moral duty to make sure no one loses their money or time to scummy businesses who lie while representing your company.  I want to give you the benefit of the doubt and just mark it off as gross incompetence, but I have a feeling that you don't think there's anything wrong with your take money first ask verification later business model.  It's not a coincidence many other people chimed in to discuss how badly you run your business.  
You lied about two things, 1. That I didn't get hung up on and 2. the reason that I didn't get my coins was because i refused to give my ID.  For the good of your employees who depend on their job to make a living, you should be more aware of how important customer service is in an industry where word gets around quick.  I hope you can take a step back and realize that you have some things you definitely need to fix, one of them being your attitude.  Yes, I could have been nicer on the phone, but understand that when you are dealing with people's money, they are trusting you with their livelihood.

Are you kidding me?  I would go back and listen to the call.  The rep clearly said "I will hang up on you" then proceeded to.  Now you are lying out your goddamn mouth.  You never once asked for my ID.  I have no sympathy for you not having people ready on Sunday, because if you can't handle the issues on that day, you should shut down trading on that day, you scumbag.  Seriously you have been caught in a lie.  If you just apologized for hanging up on me, we'd be okay.

Not always true. There have been many times in btc history that buying during a spike can result in great profit
@_date: 2013-06-29 19:47:08
Then I guess won't do that.

Call the support number or email them.  Worst case scenario, it will take a few days to get your money. But I'm 99% sure that you will not lose them.  Selling on bitcoin ATM's has caused a lot of problems with me in the past.  Stay away from the brand coinBTM because they are scumbags

I verified my account by using the instant verification, now have my bank verified.  How long would it take to sell the bit coins then for that cash to be in the bank
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:30:19
Ehh a correction would come after a little more growth than this. Its only a hundred or two above last resistance point before the last minor crash
@_date: 2013-07-31 22:46:08
I personally have had a great experience with coinbase, have only sold though, never purchased.  I think they should make it more clear that it takes a few days to receive the bitcoins because I see a new post everyday about it.  Whenever I sell now I can get the cash in my TD Bank account literally the next day, whereas it took 5 days a few months ago.  I thought achp transfers took like 3-5 days?

This makes me wonder...
Has anyone done an analysis of bitcoin addresses and see how many coins in total have not been moved since, let's say, June 2010?  I feel like that would give us a close number to how many coins are lost forever

why doesn't every miner just not accept transactions to slightly improve their chance?  Is it so they can collect the fees?
@_date: 2013-06-25 18:48:46
Thanks for your answer.  I was referring to the ones that don't confirm my transaction and have a small amount of transactions, leading me to believe it was something other than a lack of transactions.  Why would a miner choose not to include a bunch of transactions?
Here's a few examples
over 30 minutes since previous block, and only included 56 transactions compared to the usual number in the hundreds
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:39:48
do you know if our trade volume during this event is counted for in the fee volume discount?

@_date: 2013-12-04 16:14:40
No problem, it's a common issue to have
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:57:23
What I ended up using, for anyone wondering how it went here it is:
Around 9pm at night EST i submitted a bank wire transfer request for around 1000 bucks.  The fee was 20$ but no percentage (however you get less than market price for each coin but that didn't matter much to me) and at 4pm next day it was in my bank and my bank also had a 15$ wire charge.  I'm very happy with it as it did what it said it did.  Definitely cheaper ways of doing it but this is extremely fast and requires little setup.
@_date: 2013-06-25 20:45:49
That's basically what I was going for but i've been told that longer block time increases security somehow, but I can't figure out why.

How long in terms of real time are orphaned blocks mined from the real one?
Edit: Good answer btw, exactly what I was looking for.
What is the problem with orphaned blocks though?  The same amount of coins will still be released, right?

Somewhat longtime user here
There's little known as to who runs it, other than it is based out of Russia.  Support is nearly non-existent (at least for us english folk) so if you have a problem be prepared to deal with broken english.  However, I have never had an issue and I am able to withdraw and deposit coins with ease.  I've never brought any fiat into or out of it, so I can't speak with personal experience on that end, but I have not heard of any confirmed cases where a user was scammed by the site.  
TL;DR Be less afraid of getting scammed by them, but be cautious if a weird problem occurs.

What's this for?
@_date: 2013-08-13 01:14:57
Ok heres a question
What if, theoretically, all legitimate miners died and 100% of the network is controlled by one entity. This one entity modifies the blockchain to say that every previous block mined had its coins awarded to address X and now that address holds all of the coins in that chain. Would someone opening bitcoinqt for the first time download this modified blockchain?  Or just nothing at all?
@_date: 2013-08-02 00:42:00
