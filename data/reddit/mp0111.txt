So the atm does not care about confirmation time and hopes for the best? (Guess there is no other way since it would be super inconvenient)

Convince her that she covers the 9% out of her pocket for you, let’s see if that’s what her privacy is worth to her

Yeah I think I will too from now on. Much smoother to recommend to buy e.g. 10 milibtc instead of 0.01 btc

I’m using electrum w/ ledger, so I see which address has which amount
@_date: 2019-06-15 11:43:21
I’d also like that if it were mine

Yeah, was just wondering why consistently it appears that the total count is less in the minimum fee zone or, better said, why the transactions in this area have bigger size. Guess the low priority / batch &amp; consolidation explains it. Thanks everyone!!
@_date: 2019-06-02 19:43:04
Thanks, wasn’t aware that batch &amp; consolidation transaction are heavier...

Is there a way to get the btc off?

I focus more on the general news which he presents of the space and not so much on the chart analysis. He recommends dollar cost avg., which I think  is a good option, but for me trying to predict all this up and downs is probably impossible

Good to hear, I also have it and I am happy, but I have no comparison to others since I never used another before. Price is very competitive, that’s why I got it!!
