If your concern is that Bitcoin is volatile (measured in USD), also in the short term, I think that is true. But that raises the question why Bitcoin was used to do a transaction that the people involved measure in USD? 
You could replace Bitcoin for other volatile measurement sticks (stocks, oil, options). Same issue.
As regards volatility: that problem will decrease one Bitcoin achieves higher adoption and vanishes once it becomes the dominant measurement stick. The ultimate stable numeraire. Just like a kilogram is a kilogram stays a kilogram.

At the risk of shilling: see  for a 'shitcoin' that attempts to bring blockchain payments to the web. It is all browser based and has a beautiful UI. Definitely more understandable than Lightning Network with its technical operations and limitations; I still feel like a wizard when working with LN.
Having said so, LN has very active developers and the benefit of operating on the world's biggest cryptocurrency network. If LN can reach the UI level of Nimiq, we are getting there. And I suppose we will over time.

The question is whether it indeed is centralised. For the most part, it is just as decentralized in terms of project set up as Bitcoin is. 
Anyone can be a miner
Anyone can set up and use a wallet
All transactions happen from the local wallet changed in the local browser directly on the Nimiq Blockchain
Placing transactions on the Nimiq network can also be done from command line utilities/software.
Nothing custodial in nature going on here.
The only thing I do not know how is how the website  fits into this. I think the website is not necessary for the webwallet to work but this is a good question to explore.
So centralisation does not seem to be an immediate issue although the network is still young and small.
But anyway, the reason for mentioning this project is showing how UI can stow away various technical elements of a blockchain to make it usable for laymen. 
I currently use Blue Wallet for LN because (i) there are Android and iOS wallets available and (ii) the custodial setup takes away much of the technical challenges in setting up and receiving a LN payment. For small amounts, I am ok with this.

Bitcoin makes more sense @ $1,000,000 than $10,000.
Perhaps Bitcoin will become the 'stable numeraire' that the world is looking for: 
"The search is on for a valid yardstick, a measure of monetary value that has not been (and cannot be) distorted by central banks’ firefighting and wrecking tactics."
Since the 'wrecking' of fiat currency intensifies, expect the markets to seek ways out of this mess.
Another interesting read: 
"We are starting to see Chinese money being pulled from these “offshore” markets and this money could very well start finding its way into the Bitcoin and crypto markets from both inside and outside China.  Central bank policies and stumbling bond markets would normally provide the alternative to real estate but we are entering a period where the perfect situation is developing for capital to flee real estate, avoid bond markets, and pour directly into the crypto market, with some overflow moving into gold and other precious metals. Stock markets may move marginally higher during this transition, but those markets are in the high range of valuation (and under enhanced risk) while crypto is still in the early phase of adoption and remains in the low range of valuation for the time being. This will change substantially in the next 6 to 12 months as the developing fundamentals of the crypto market take root and expand across investor demographics and industry sectors."
If Bitcoin can attain the World's standard of metrics for money, $1,000,000 is just a low ball offer.

Looking at the rate of adoption, we are still below 1% of the potential. But price wise, a lot of potential has already been captured in the form of speculation.
Nonetheless, from a broad perspective of 'potential' (i.e., can it become a worldwide success) there is still a lot that can be gained.
For now, the speculative part rules the pool (and the minds of most 'investors'). Price can go up, price can go down. While the future of Bitcoin seems bright, price could down 20-30% in the blink of an eye.

You could argue otherwise as long as the net effect is zero.
if loan are granted against fixed collateral (e.g., a house), the money supply would increase a little. If the loan is repaid, the money supply would decrease a little again. The net effect over time would be zero.  
The problem starts when considering more aspects of this mechanism. The unseen consequences that economists and politicians so easily (want to) forget.
If the loan is used to create a producing asset, it could be said that society benefits. There will be more products available. 
But if the loan is wasted because the plan failed to return a result (or the money was used for speculation), it could be said that society is damaged (because resources wasted).
If banks make good lending decisions, we should see (over the whole set of loans made) rising production with an overal positive effect for society. If fractional reserve banking makes that possible (temporarily liquifying an asset), this tool should not necessarily be frowned upon.
But if fractional reserve banking turns into a money printing fest almost exclusively channeled into speculation instead of production without any intention (or possibility) to ever pay back the loans, the cause for allowing fractional reserve banking is lost. This besides the increase in fragility of banks and the financial system as a whole.
It is clear that we are way down the road in terms of prudent fractional reserve banking. This gives the instrument a bad name (and understandably). Thats a shame because it can also serve a beneficial role.
But looking further, the question is whether we still need a government setting the rules about money and granting privileges to entities to create and destroy money. The question on how credit would/could work under a Bitcoin standard is profound. I think the narrative about Bitcoin and credit is still in its infancy.

You are right that Bitcoin/crypto only just compensating for inflation won't give it an advantages compared to other inflation hedges. What I mean is an extra effect of more wealth moving into hard assets, effecting a shift into different asset classes. If a tiny flow would start to move into crypto because of this (e.g., Bitcoin as Digital Gold), the effect on price could be massive (with most probably a cornering of the market and price spikes).

You have to admit that the gap between Bitcoin awareness and actual use is becoming very large. If those sides suddenly converge in the right direction..... Biggest wealth transfer ever.

It seems you really need a testnet LN wallet. A mainnet LN wallet doea not accept the invoice.

What I mean with 'people can decide themselves' is that they are free to choose not managing private keys themselves and let someone else, like a bank, do that for them. 
I do not think banks are evil. They also do not need to go. But the monetary system must be reformed. If enough people switch to hard(er) money, the role of banks will change and their power over money will decrease. All it takes is changing the system we use. Not by attacking banks just because they are banks operating in the current environment that we simply have right now.
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:38:04
Your comment seems to imply that banks are criminal institutions. If you have problems with privileges granted to banks, point your concerns to the rules (and the politicians creating these rules). 
Although banks may have had (and have) agendas of their own, you cant blame individual banks from competing in the field within the room available under current legislation. 
Putting on a yellow vest and shouting angry words won't advance the Bitcoin case.

Its better to take a $1,250 Bitcoin into account in your strategy than to dismiss it out of hand. In the last crypto winter, you only heard crickets at the bottom. Look at where we are now (=still entertained..).

For many people, storing private keys is not a simple task. There is no objwction to people choosing third parties to provide services in this respect.
We should not spit on banks. We just want less centralised control over (creation of) our currency. This ABN AMRO pilot does not interfere with this wish. Can't print Bitcoin, capice?
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:07:10
You could try Blue Wallet for iPhone. Its a custodial solution meaning that a third party is necessary to maintain the wallet, but a very easy manner to get acquainted with LN. No own LN node needed.
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:49:24
It would put a crypto wallet in an ever growing number of pockets. I hope that developments in blockchain software are sufficient in the meantime to make it user friendly for all those Samsung phone owners (and other phone manufacturers who will follow no doubt).

Here is a good read on MMT: 
A gem from the comment section:
"In the modern system, there are more tickets sold than seats in the house (more money/debt printed than products and services, at current prices.) The elites are good at playing for time, but eventually ticket holders will want to go in.
So you’re down to a choice among: denying entry to some tickets (default/deflation,) putting 4 people in every 3 seats (inflation/devaluation,) announcing everyone must wait indefinitely (financial repression,) and building more seats (economic growth.) If you’re the global empire, you can also make the neighboring theater honor some of your tickets, or make war to make that happen. There are no other ways out, and even if miracles come out of the labs, people may not spend money on them, so growth is really outside Team Elite’s control.
Historically, the Western elites have been pretty good at effecting a combination of the scenarios, to spread around the stress and keep their system alive."
Bitcoin is a great experiment trying to wrestle control over money out of the hands of a select few.

Let's do a little mind game:
* I am the government
* I trash the official (fiat) currency (lets leave out how this is done)
* prices of stuff measured in the currency rise
* I call the price rise of assets: profits
* I tax the hell out of these profits
'Because it's fair'.

The Bitcoin price will adjust versus parameters like user total, user preference etc. If coins are lost and everything else remains equal, we should expect Bitcoin price to increase a little. 
Satoshi already acknowledged that this would happen:
"Those coins can never be recovered, and the total circulation is less. Since the effective circulation is reduced, all the remaining coins are worth slightly more. It's the opposite of when a government prints money and the value of existing money goes down."
And on population growth or decline:
"To Sepp's question, indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things."
On accomodating billions of users:
"Eventually at most only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the world if it really gets huge. But don't worry, there are another 6 decimal places that aren't shown, for a total of 8 decimal places internally. It shows 1.00 but internally it's 1.00000000. If there's massive deflation in the future, the software could show more decimal places."
Bitcoin is a great test of assumptions that are held for the truth. We will see how this maximum-number-of-coins plan pans out. Excited to see what 'hard money' will bring to the world.

The present cases of hyperinflation are limited. There is also no indication that major currencies will 'hyper'inflate soon. Inflate, yes. Hyperinflate, no.
Nonetheless, inflation will be positive for the case for cryptocurrencies. And increased inflation in major currencies seems to appear on the horizon (perhaps after a short deflationay shock).
I would expect an official rise of inflation to 5-10% annually to be a great factor in the potential rise of crypto. This besides increased adoption.
But my outlook for both is 5-10 years rather than 1-3 years. Moon won't be back soon.

LN makes Bitcoin useable in daily life. It remains to be seen whether merchants will pick up on this sufficiently (offline and/or online) so that the gap between users and merchants becomes smaller.
At least online I would expect LN to establish a mini breakthrough.
