Isn't it only a taxable event if you convert it back to USD? My understanding was that you only had to report it when you cash out.So, if the person with $300k doesn't cash out then no tax event. If they cash out, then they pay tax on whatever the value is at that time. That's how stocks work, and my understanding is that the IRS is treating crypto similar to a stock.

No, it's only been a real problem with Bitcoin lately.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:51:06
At the current fee level it won't be doing any of that...

The fact that you can’t even consider the idea the someone else might be right tells me that you simply cannot think for yourself. It’s also possible that you are the one subscribing to a scam and pr narrative. Given that you can’t even entertain the idea that you might be wrong without necessarily believing points to you being the one lacking common sense. The world isn’t black and white, yet you seem to think it is. They are insanely compatible. They share the same history, it’s just fundamentally two groups feel it should be handled differently and so it forked. At its core that’s all it is. All the people flaming the opposing side are just buying into the propaganda wagon of their chosen crypto deity. Whomever makes crypto the most easy to use and consumer friendly is going to win, even if BCH was a scam, it could still take the win in the long run. I’m not saying it will, but it’s possible. If you can’t even consider that possibility without necessarily subscribing to it then congratulations, your one of the dumb people who doesn’t know they are dumb. Don’t think about Roger Ver, don’t think about Adam Back. Just look at the merits and downfall of both systems and which one you think has the best chance to hold out. Think of the user experience using the crypto ( BTC was a shit show when you couldn’t move currency without paying a ridiculous fee last year) it’s better now, but at the time BCH was a clear winner in usability. There will be bumps on that road for all cryptos, and all it takes is a bump at just the right time to result in success or failure.

Semantics... It doesn't change my point...
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:30:04
Then why don’t I see Bitcoin ABC used on any exchange? My point is not wrong, those are the standard names that everyone who isn’t knee deep in the tech uses and no one gets upset when someone calls it Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin ABC.

Well, in that case conversation over. Go on not listening to any argument that might disagree with you. The fact that you just readily dismiss what I say as lies means you simply cannot be reasoned with. Best of luck. You have not explained anything from an engineering, linguistic, or consumer standpoint. You just keep shouting that anything not Bitcoin is a lie and must be a scam. You keep saying that it's proven that BCH is a scam, I'd like to see the full justification for that. Saying it doesn't make it true. It might very well be a scam, but so could BTC. There is even the possibility that both are a scam. But I'm just wasting my time here so I'm bowing out. If you must have the last word, then carry on.

Oh the irony... why does this bot even exist...
@_date: 2018-08-21 18:37:42
You are doing the same thing you are blaming others for doing by calling bitcoin cash bcash. I’m not taking sides here, just making a point. I hold both BTC and BCH, I want both to succeed.  As far as I’m concerned, they are called Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Core and bcash are both terms that need to die when in reference to the crypto itself.
edit: I love how just trying to make a reasonable statement that doesn't bash another crypto gets you down voted... I think everyone here that pressed that downvote button needs a dose of reality. The answer is not as clear cut as many of you seem to think it is.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:25:28
What are you smoking man? Stop thinking like an engineer for a minute and think like a general consumer. If bitcoin is to ever be truly successful, the majority of the users will be technically illiterate. The names on the exchanges are the only thing people are going to know it by. No one today refers to the US Dollar as US Dollar core or US Dollar ABC or probably a better example would be US Dollar US Bank. It’s just the US Dollar. Just like bitcoin is just going to be Bitcoin and Litecoin is going to be Litecoin. All that other stuff you keep pushing as me not getting it is the technical details that no one in the real world is going to give two shits about if they can buy their coffee with it. I’m not saying you are wrong about the names, I understand the tech, just that you are not understanding my point in the slightest, I’m talking about how the general consumer sees the name.
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:38:26
Bitcoin and bitcoin cash is like purple and red koolaid. The fact that you keep trying to push me into the bitcoin cash camp means you drank the purple shit. I’d argue it’s you that aren’t looking at this objectively. Both sides have their propaganda, it’s just like people that can’t understand how someone could like some things both republicans and democrats do, while dislike other things. The world isn’t so black and white. The abbreviations in the context I am calling out are problems because they stand to try to discredit the other team. The crypto that will win in the end is the one that normal non-tech people find easy to use and to understand. For all we know at this point the word bitcoin may not be in that crypto at all. Yahoo used to be the top search engine too. Just because bitcoin is king now doesn’t mean it will stay there regardless of whether the tech is superior or not. It might, and it might not. Claiming you know the answer for a fact just means you are the ignorant one. Weighing each side equally is in fact being impartial... that’s pretty much the definition dude.
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:57:13
I’m referring to the names most people refer to them by, and what they are in the public image. The tech stuff doesn’t matter to most people. I understand what you are saying, but it’s completely irrelevant to my point. I never argued that bitcoin core wasn’t just a client, but a lot of bitcoin cash supporters refer to bitcoin as Bcore or Bitcoin core (not referring to the program, but the crypto itself) while bitcoin supporters refer to Bitcoin cash as bcash. My point is that name flaming needs to stop on both ends, it’s the reason there is all this confusion to begin with. BTC is bitcoin and BCH is bitcoin cash and they should only be referred to as such. If your talking about protocol naming and clients, that’s a whole other thing that I wasn’t addressing in my original statement. I’m just referencing the public naming of the two, that’s all. For my arguments purpose I don’t care if the name is a client or a protocol, or some other software component. The name people see on the exchanges is for all intents and purposes the only name.
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:23:59
I’m not confused... the fact that you are referring to bitcoin cash as bcash IS THE PROBLEM. Both sides are using stupid pet names to try to discredit the other side and I’m sick of it. That’s literally the entire point I’ve been trying to make. Your statement that I’m confused by how “bcash” supporters talk, is not me being confused, I’m calling you and others like you out on the fact that you refer to it as bcash. Yes, some of them do the same by calling bitcoin (BTC) bitcoin core or Bcore. Both of your sides are part of the fucking problem and that is what needs to change. I’m not picking a side ffs, just stating what immature bullshit I see looking in from the outside.
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:58:28
There are people on both sides employing shady tactics, but it is likely just a few of the many. Honestly, they are just two different currencies with the same history. Both have their positives and negatives, so I am not going to subscribe solely to one camp or the other. I think everyone would be better off promoting the positives of the coin they believe in and leaving it at that. Let the best coin win (or how about just coexist peacefully). I've just had enough of the toxic bs from both sides.
@_date: 2019-11-07 18:26:53
I think you are both right to a point. There is a certain minimum amount of work that needs to be accomplished. The issue is that we now focus on trying to have jobs for everyone which means we have to create a bunch of work that “needs” to be done so we can employ more people. We need to shift focus to reducing jobs in lieu of gaining more free time. When something comes along that makes a job easier, use it to provide society more free time to do what they enjoy and not increase productivity constantly. If we could shift from this mentality of getting as much done as possible always, we could worry about the work that actually needs to be done and help build a better society where people are more free to pursue their passions and not stressed all the time about how to provide for themselves and their family.
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:10:45
It’s still a cultural thing tied to the capitalistic society we live in. Consumerism is a thing that will have to die off eventually. It’s not sustainable, so I still stand by my point.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:17:01
Honestly, if bitcoin does become the currency of the world, that's the only way banks will be able to stay in business. Manage the money for people who don't want to.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:21:14
Problem is, we still don't know which one that is. Yes Bitcoin is currently at the top, but that doesn't mean it will stay there. This whole thing is still in its infancy, so hedging your bets across a couple you think might win is still worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:06:11
The tech that allows reasonable transaction times at reasonable fees. It really is that simple. Personally, I don't want to see either coin fail, but neither is perfect, and right now BCH is a much better currency than BTC. It took me 14 hours to move BTC last weekend, that's one of the problems with banks transferring funds that bitcoin is supposed to solve and it's failing in that regard quite spectacularly. If you don't think that's a problem, then you have your head in the sand. I have some of both, so whichever way it goes I'll be fine. But lets not pretend BCH is garbage, because right now it is better at being what bitcoin was intended to be than bitcoin is.

Yeah, if I could pay off my debt with it, I would cash out immediately and do exactly what he did. I'd rather not have the debt and be able to risk the money if things tanked, than risk the money I could pay the debt back with.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:17:49
Honestly, all this we rule and they suck I see on both sides makes me not trust either sub. No one is looking at anything objectively. I hold both, may the best win.
@_date: 2019-12-26 05:48:06
Well, the first problem is that there is no way the same returns shown in the image can happen again with Bitcoin. So using it to justify buying it over gold is a fools errand. Granted I like bitcoin, but this doesn't demonstrate any sort of reality.
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:20:48
His statement was one  The whole point of bitcoin is for people to mine. How is pushing out hobbyist miners good?!? That’s bad.
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:01:48
I reread again, I see what you said now. I agree.
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:13:48
Well, it's mostly because I already have an old iPhone that I can kind of use as a hardware wallet. It's not on cellular any more and I can leave it in airplane mode unless I need it as well as the fact that I am not carrying it with me all the time, so it's more secure than just using the same app on my regular cell. Basically it's free. I may consider getting a hardware wallet though at some point. The nano does look pretty nice.
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:10:20
It looks like Breadwallet is a pretty common answer, so I think I'll go ahead and give that a go. Thanks for the recommendations.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:28:32
Breadwallet is solid. That's what I have been using per recommendation from others. Bitcoin.org does a good job of listing wallets as well (breadwallet is included)

I'm looking for a safe place to store my btc that is not on an exchange where it's vulnerable. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:16:42
I'll have to learn a fair bit more before I am comfortable with a setup like that. But I think that might be a good direction to go. I don't have enough at stake quite yet though. I'll get there eventually.
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:08:53
I still appreciate the information, There is definitely a lot to learn about this still. I've just found it frustrating looking for an app I can trust, and that will be able to handle the fork without losing my btc.
