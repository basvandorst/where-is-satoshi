1. I think that we'll see "Sponsored Minning" meaning brands who will depend on them will either pay cash, BTC, or new mined token of thennew blockchain if they are also a store of economic value. As this miners are also Bitcoinminers they'll see new income flows and at the end meaning more security to the bitcoin network too.
2. Value flowing through sidechains don't flow over Bitcoin so if that value was expected to be part of the future bitcoins value, then it will afect it's price (ie: WU and others remitances flowing over a sidechain). Also millions of brands could be needing their own decentralized database and so fixing bitcoin units to build the sidechain and or paying the sponsored mining. So i would say that it does affect the price but depending how does the mining worksout, coins could be highly demanded too.

Guys, I see the point about the "cult" thought I dissagree.
Personally I tend to thank God out loud at bedtime with my kids for the good things we have recieved and so, not because of being big religious but because we are just grateful and want to induce them to be too. Is that stupid too? Thanking someone you just aren't even sure he exists? Perhaps but so many do it anyway.
In this case perhaps someones are glad to say out loud how thanks to bitcoin they were able to fight against an illness (buying unregulated drugs), could pay their kids college, could buy their house, etc. Or thank the real gu who unknowingly made so many's life better for them and the world.
Some just keepit for them self and some just feel that making it public is more real (even more when there is a real guy out there to listen). So I don't see a cult here.
But anyway, who cares? There's space for everyone!

Exactly! That was me and here is the short story.  
Since then I felt I needed to give back and I built a team for putting up the Argentinean Foundation, The Bitcoin Center, the laBITconf.com, and supported the creation of the GBA. I'm actually working in two new other Bitcoin related projects.
The fun thing is that, beyond having a simalr logo?'c the fact is that branded coins will be for me one of the killer apps of the actual Bitcoin too and that's one of the things I'm trying to build up in a sort of related way.

No, I don't mind, but I won't say either...

I don't agree:
1) Prívate blockchains need to decentralize trust among their own network, which it might not even allow unknown hashing power to be aded beyond their closed network.
2) Power used to back bitcoin won't be used to destroy another blockchain as this would also affect bitcoin's security. It's like thinking thats google will use their servers to attack bitcoin if there was enoigh incentive, but their servers are in use for googles functioning.
3) Stealling trillions investing millioms is not as common or easy as it leaves a big and esay track, and just as in bitcoin it would perhaps render the stolen assets useless because they lost the trust, or a fork could be created by the well known private peers in the network.
4) Incentives could flow in the centralidez system as a payment for your effort (hashing power). That money would be the one priorly used to back security in the old centralized database system.

We'll let you know!!!

Actually I used blockchain.info from the phone, but someone used the official tool and it did work!

Nice!!!! Thanks for supporting the project Bruce!

We'll check the problem. In the mean time, place your bid in twitter using the  and your bid. Remember the actual bid must be 2.2 BTC or more and all proceedings go to BitGive as the laBITconf conferences and our NGO are ad-honorem.

We'll fix it soon, thanks!

Unfortunately you've been outbid ;-)

Is this a sarcastic joke or a real comment? Sorry!

Anyone wants to help me code up this project? BitcoinTimeCapsule.com (BTC) it's from a year ago but still applicable!
