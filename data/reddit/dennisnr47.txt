I saw they always bashing btc and enterprise  bch so i asked once why the bch sub is not used for bch information but is not used at all. The btc is a sub should be also a bitcoin stuff . Somebody gave me my first gold while i was beeing downvoted. It is a toxic environment there wow.

That’s illegal? Idk man, i hope they don’t. But this are big accusations  to make without proof don’t you think? If it is true what you say it’s price manupulation yes? Somebody needs to really find proof of it and sue them.
