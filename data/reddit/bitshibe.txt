Cloud flair 504! Must be popular! Looks good so far from what I did. This solves lots of problems for my less tech savvy friends.

My story: I have a crippled Cointerra machine only running on 3/4 cores. It is a week old. I am waiting to hear back from them as to RMA or not. Bugs me that they are selling from stock and not fixing or replacing my unit. But to be fair I told them I would be willing to wait for a unit that actually hashes at the full 2 TH/s. They replied within a day to my initial emails, waiting for the final solution. Maybe the best customers are the ones you already have.

I thought the rebound would take at least one more day, but yes everyone back in to the pool!

Finance Minister is trying to close the consumer price gap with the US. Bitcoin would close that gap by several percent.
Canadian government is primarily concerned with terrorists using bitcoin. Need to demonstrate how silly that would be.

What if it is a HYIP but not a ponzi? What sort of questions would you ask and what sort of responses would make you feel it was not a scam?

If your margins are so thin that you can't take the volatility how do you handle price swings? I don't think your argument is very strong. Maybe you are doing it wrong. The market will force you to find other efficiencies before facing extinction. Maybe you should set a quota and run some power on *all* the pools. That way you will have a piece of every single block that is rewarded.

Yeah Josh said they were going to use the test net only but then they didn't and said meh. I read it on the chatbox with my own eyes!

Amen brother. I wish China would straight up ban bitcoin so their rumors stop holding us randsom.

Bitcoin never left $1200 in my heart. I'm just waiting for it to come back. It always comes back.
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:05:59
Wow this is kind of a big deal. If they kill bitcoin I won't be voting conservative ever again.
Please keep us informed as to how you plan to deal with these setbacks. I need to know if there is something I can do to help.

740,000 btc that were sold and in circulation that otherwise wouldn't. I wonder how much higher the price should have been. If they can get DPR... ?

Fees are good because they include insurance. Simple and safe. There is a market for that. Me? I like to live dangerous and save that 2%.

Dumping bitcoin? First, Ug. Second, thanks for the cheap coins! Cheaper than mining myself. See you at $10,000!

I love this idea. But I horde my bitcoin. Dogecoin I love to share. Will there be other coin support? On closer inspection I see coinbase has to be integrated. Maybe if coinbase supports doge coin, one day...

If you are making a truth claim that wall street WILL NOT advance bitcoin what evidence do you have to back that claim up ? Lack of evidence or ignorance of evidence doesn't make for a good argument.

I've been using them for a long time (2 + years) and I have no complaints. I would like to see a debit card product that purchases bitcoin as I use the card. I don't want to carry a balance in btc. Or maybe a credit card like product and have a monthly statement that I can use access to my bank account to pay off in fiat. Make it cash back rewards or bitcoin back rewards. Something that leverages bitcoin's low fees to save money on everyday purchases. TFSA would be awesome too. Imagine tax fee capital gains on bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-09-30 21:45:00
I'd buy that. Hopefully some dividends. Ipo on reddit. Me like.

I like bitcoin. I also like doge coin. I think they both serve a purpose and are complementary. Bitcoin is the older more serious brother. Doge coin is fun and friendly. I used to hate all alt coins. They detract attention from bitcoin, there isn't any serious alt coin out there that is that much better than bitcoin. Bitcoin can be changed if necessary. But doge coin is different. It's got a f+++ it let's have some fun mentality. Tips out ! Spread the love. Not so much about the technology or value so much as it is a state of mind.

Hope around bitcoin black Friday. Or maybe they thought that the spike from last year might happen again.
