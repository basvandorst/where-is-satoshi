trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, *it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.* [emphasis added]

i expect them to announce a new dvd set (12+ months) before these ship:  "how to run a wildly profitable vaporware business"

he's probably using this service to mix his own coins, and i'm sure ads won't be far behind

this mBTC and decimal shifting crap is just too confusing
i propose a system where 1/12 of a bitcoin is the new unit, called pinkies

yeah, calling a bitcoin a string of numbers and letters retards adoption, not hard-to-follow rants like this.
a bitcoin is a ledger entry, who's validity is proven by a long string of numbers and letters

Isn't this an argument against reserve banking?  What "bank panic" would ever happen in a BTC economy?
The death of the ponzi banking model has come, and I think bitcoin is a better answer than the "we have all of the guns" solution to the bank run problem that the fed offers.

i wouldn't trust anyone but ASICminer for ASIC hardware, frankly.  if you think about it logically, they're the only ones being both moral and rational about the ASIC development situation.
it does not make sense to develop ASIC miners, and then ship them, without mining first--period.  at least friedcat embraced it, and created a win-win-win situation.
the other companies appear fumbling, greedy, and delusional (publicly).

No, the USD is not electronic cash--the last time I checked--I couldn't defend my checking account's balance by gunpoint.  I can, however, defend my paper wallet that way.
Put some thought into the "bitcoin is digital *cash* (as in, cold/hard)" metaphor, before you make more of a fool out of yourself.

uhm isn't he a major investor in vitaminwater? and isn't that just one of his successful business ventures?  not sure how you judge someone an idiot, but it probably doesn't align with objective reality very well

incompetence.  shocking.  when you're a multi-million dollar business owner, it can be tricky to hire like 4 guys to implement solutions to problems that were solved in 1997, especially when it takes at least as many people to wipe the drool and snot off your own face every few minutes.
with respect, tux.

driving the price to where it was... a few hours ago?
i agree with your point about making it easier for big money types, but gox has been dealing with ~million dollar market orders for a while now

so you have control of the private keys?  not interested.

i wonder what would happen if the auctions were relisted just as ASIC hashing hardware without any mention of bitcoin

there were a few weeks over the past month or so where LTC was less profitable than BTC, especially with its price dropping and difficulty increasing
@_date: 2013-06-16 09:23:23
wonder if there was some arbitrage method between mtgox and btc-e that was made unprofitable because of the dwolla block

in theory what you're saying is correct, but in practice it's just annoying and misses the point
