People cash out at round numbers. 12k, 13k, 14k etc with their limit orders.
It comes back up though, just takes a few weeks.

Sell isn’t really a word we use around here...

Limit order $6k in place.

World War III would mean the end of humanity. The war after that one would be fought with sticks and stones. Einstein said that.
What a weird question to ask...

The correct answer to "How much bitcoin do you own?" is "Not enough!"
Never ask. It's just a rule :)

Robinhood, Gemini if you want an online broker but the safest way is to buy a hardware wallet and store all of your bitcoin on that.

if it passes the 20k wall and continues for a few weeks or a month, i'll consider my DCA strategy, but once it hits that number, i'm going to hold off a bit and see what happens.
If it tanks, i'll just buy more on sale.

It’s called spread.  Bid price vs. ask price.

What platform is this?
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:19:35
Supply and demand though. With infinite gold, price will drop.

Coonbase crashed. It’s back up.

Every couple weeks, a % of my paycheck goes into my BTC wallet.
I also buy dips and sell ATH's.  I guess you could say I do a mix of DCA and day trading bitcoin, but only if I see strong signals for entry and exit points.
Done well so far.

Is it worth it for the lifetime pass? $350 seems like a lot for a complex set of algorithms. What’s the accuracy on this thing?

It will go through. In the meantime, pop a Xanax and just wait for coinbase to process your transfer.

Oh yeah... 7 1/1,000 of one cent. Is that right? That looks weird

Not hard at all. I don't remember exactly how long it took but I had a decent CPU and just let it run for a few days.

I mined 50 bitcoin on my desktop back in the day when it was all beginning. Didn't think anything of it, just wanted to try out this new tech.
That hard drive is long gone...

He just donated 7 1/000th of one cent :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:15:45
It's all good. I got over it. I'm not financially hurting. Makes for a good party story :)
