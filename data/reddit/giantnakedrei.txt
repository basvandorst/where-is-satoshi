But don't forget to backup!  Never hurts to have an extra (secure) backup!

A large reason I diversified into LTC was because of the influx of ASIC miners and the (engage hipster mode) popularity of bitcoin.  Using just my available hardware - that I also can use for recreation, I can easily pull a profit mining altcoins and exchanging them for bitcoins - given that the only way I can cash out altcoins easily is using bitcoins as a proxy.
The goal of bitcoin is a digital currency - but a sizable percentage of the user base are using it solely as an investment - seeing the tremendous growth of 2013.  The biggest problem is that at the value levels required to use it as a currency, we have to use satoshis as a denomination - and trading/spending .00000152 of a bitcoin isn't in line with how currencies are commonly used.  It doesn't help that I live in a society based heavily on cash - although debit and credit (as well as 3rd party RFID/NFC) payment options are pretty widespread, almost all purchases here are in cash.
BTC is like the bearer bonds of digital currency.  LTC is more like the spending cash (all about the... Hamiltons?).  Dogecoin is like pennies, but it seems to be more popular and have a more positive (if not annoying) community.

English document, probably issued through US legal system - there is no registration of hanko/inkan, so he'd need to sign as well.

Pretty much - you make your mark.  You can make a fucking illustration or just plop down an X - the act of signing is important, not specifically the resulting signature - it indicates both identity and assent to the document.
That being said, having a basically consistent signature is also a means of fraud protection to weed out obvious forgeries.  Also 'illiterate' signers generally require a literate witness to countersign.
Registered seals can be a pain in the ass, but are generally fraud-proof (unless someone makes off with your company inkan or your hanko and stamps stuff without you knowing about it.)  Getting one made is easy, and getting it registered isn't much of a hassle.  But then again, you generally have to write your name as well - then the hanko/inkan works more like a stamp-able initials throughout the rest of the document.

Most official stuff (like utilities/cellphone bill) can be handled easily, bring the slip to the nearest post office or convenience store (or even most grocery stores) and pay in cash.  Otherwise pretty much every company prefers you pay by direct transfer - the Japanese funky form of debit payment.

But nothing stops the user from copying the data out from the blockchain - or HBOchain.  And distributed peer networks ie bittorrent and bitcoin - mean that data is available publicly - or at least easily accessed.  And controlling that network means controlling 51% - not feasible for any publicly operating company.

AFAIK not so much a product, but a commodity.  Subject to sales tax on purchase and the equivalent of capital gains tax income generated through its purchase.

I agree with your mining point - but so far I don't know of any Scrypt ASIC miners that are actually in production or having an impact in the same way it did to bitcoin mining.  Hence my point is still valid - I can still make a profit without needing multiple MH/s mining Scrypt based altcoins.
As for currency - using prefixes (even SI) is not conducive to widespread use as a currency.  However, there is room as a digital currency (seeing as you don't have to calculate things in your head.)

That is the idea - the weaker the yen gets the better Japanese export industries can profit.  Sparking inflation is on of the big points of Abenomics...
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:35:47
From what I understand, if you buy Bitcoins, you pay a tax on that transaction (sales tax) at the exchange. And if you cash out your bitcoins, you pay on the capital gain. 
If you buy something *with* bitcoins, you pay the regular price, but banks may not facilitate or use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-13 00:19:37
That may very well be so, and personally speaking I don't agree with Abenomics (or his politics in general).
The yen has been stagnant or deflationary for years.  The exchange rate in 2011 was in the 80-90 yen to $1 USD range.  Now its 104 to the dollar.  This does help the economy - consumer prices haven't gone up.  Neither have wages/salaries.  A big push to spark a rise in wages is the increase of the sales tax from 5% to 8%.  Will it work? Probably not.
Bitcoin is attractive to a very select number of people in Japan - the rare tech and economically savvy.  Pretty much everybody else trusts the massive banks to keep their cash safe, even if there is no interest earned.
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:03:45
The point is that over the past year, ASIC (and some pretty incompetent and shady businesses) have grown to dominate the mining pool.  Maybe this isn't really a change, but that isn't the main thing IMO.
Yes you can use satoshi - but no modern currency trades to 8 decimal places.  The most common currencies trade to 2 (dollar and pound).  Even currencies like the yen only work in whole numbers.  The Satoshi as a common denomination is not conducive to use as a daily currency.

It helps that many currencies work on a large number basis like doge - Japanese yen is about 100 yen to the US dollar and the South Korean Won is about 1000 won to the US dollar.  Shockingly close do dogecoin which is currently 1069KRW/USD and 950DOGE/USD

Business hours in Japan are short.  (Many/most banks close at 3PM).  Although many Japanese workers stay MUCH longer.

Japanese banks are shit. - It's a side effect of society in general.  
* Want to use an ATM at 2 PM on a Sunday? Too bad - they're closed.  
* Want to go to the bank at 4 PM on a weekday? Too bad their closed. 
* Want to get money out of Japan.  Want to get money out of the country? That'll cost $50-$120 just from the Japanese end. And you can only take out $3000 per month.  
* Want electronic banking so you don't have to go and stand in line at the ATM or take time off to go to a bank office?  Too bad, you can't do much.  
* Credit Cards are pretty rare - its a cash based society.
* Also, you get 0 return on your bank balance.  To say the economy is stagnant is an understatement.
The only upside is that MtGox apparently can pay out to Japanese banks quickly. (Don't quote me on this, I'm not sure, as I don't use MtGox.)
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:13:14
But not as bad as Gox.

Production doesn't matter much - unless they're already mining at a greater purchase and energy cost efficiency, they'll be a while before they impact the altcoins in a serious way.  Currently the only ones I know are SHA ASICs with a piggyback to mine Scrypt at much lower efficiency.   
I think the big reason ASICs exploded onto the scene last year is the drastic uptick in bitcoin trade when the value began to go up.  With the tight ties between bitcoin and altcoin trade, that isn't likely to happen again - so Scrypt ASICs will take longer to make it to their miners.
I see it like this.  I've spent only $250 on parts for mining using GPUs - and the GPUs I use are also used for other purposes.  In the 2 years I've been mining, I've made about 1500% ROI (when accounting for the increase in electricity usage).  When ASICs come out for Scrypt altcoins I don't think they'll make the same ROI.  And after you're done mining with them, then what will you use them for?  I can use my mining rig as a large pixel array for rendering video, playing games at extreme resolutions etc.

If you can find a store that knows how to do it.  Otherwise you get to sit around for an hour while they search for their unlocking SIM.

The biggest barrier to bitcoin in Japan is payment methods.  Outside of NFC systems, just about everything is cash.  The whole society is extremely cash biased, which makes some things very simple, but complicates bitcoin to no end to end users.
As far as electronic payment goes, most large retailers have NFC based payment methods - like JR's Suica/ICOCA etc.  But the market is pretty fragmented.  Large retailers have their own systems/cards like AEON's WAON, there is also nanako, taspo and edy.  Bitcoin could make some major headway, but it has to fight the establishment and the culture at every step.

Private savings in general is ridiculous in Japan - the (semi)modern economy of 9/10 households, combined with very little spare time for workers to relax/enjoy/spend their money on travel/leisure goods means that most people have a fair bit of cash saved up. As a foreigner living in Japan, I know one or two people who are interested in Bitcoin - mostly after they found out I was mining it.

Well, consumer prices don't seem to be edging upwards yet, so I wouldn't transfer everything in a panic yet - but don't limit yourself to just bitcoin or investment commodities - diversity is security.
Even if bitcoin is fairly safe from a 51% attack, the exchanges (especially mtgox) do seem to be... less than secure.  Gold and silver vacillates based on demand as well, so it isn't a secure investment. (I'm no investment guru, but I have a little money in a few different investment varieties).
Don't put all your eggs in one basket, no matter how lucrative it might appear.
