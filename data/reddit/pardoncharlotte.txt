I bought more when it "dipped" down to $17800 ��

If so, I will donate today!

Go through account set up and verification on coinbase. Log in to gdax using same account login. Transfer your money to gdax from your bank. Place limit order. Ta da!

What a wild ride!

My almost-10-year-old was interested. Mostly because he's getting a couple cents per month interest in his savings account and is always pretty bummed when he sees his statement. He thinks he'd rather spend the money on Xbox games than get 3 extra cents a month on the money sitting in the bank, which I understand. I let him put some money of his into a separate wallet on my coinbase account and he's much happier with the result there.
I say go for it and see what he / she says :)

Probably why his goldmoney company recently started to integrate bitcoin - ref:

Happened to me. I emailed support. They fixed it within the 4-5 business days just like they said they would. After it was all said and done, they increased my limits beyond what they had been, and then increased them again a few days later. (Probably varies per person.) Deposit the funds to your bank. Log in to gdax and start to transfer from your bank. It'll take a week to get there but there's no fee. Buy the btc and transfer it out of gdax to your friend's wallet. Then, just give your coinbase referral link to friend's in the future. Investing for friends is a quick way to screw up a relationship in my opinion. Let them do it themselves so they have all the responsibility.

Second thought: just put 150 $ worth of btc in a wallet for him from your stash and use the cash he gave you to buy more when you can. This might be worse for you in the long run but at least you will have kept your word.

Open bazaar. They have a subreddit too.

We just chose by. Keeping it simple so he can see it all in one place. If he wants to later maybe we'll divide it up.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:02:35
Honestly though, I just keep reading and hope I catch on.

My son has a few hundred in his savings account. We talked previously about interest etc when we created the account. He is always disappointed when he sees the 6 cents he's earned at the end of the month. So we just talked about bitcoin and he decided to move his money there. (I am going to back it for him, but he doesn't know that.) I want him to watch it go up and down and hopefully learn something in the process. We'll see how it goes!
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:59:27
We should go hang out in the corner together!
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:45:16
Agreed. Honestly I just want to get him interested and wanting to learn more about money, investing, etc. It's a lot easier to get excited over $20 gain in a day than 6 cents in a month. When it dips he can feel that sickening feeling of loss too lol. I want him to be excited and learn while he's young and give him the head start I wish I had.

That seems oddly specific...

No problems so far with USAA and Navy Federal :)

My limit was also decreased from 1250 to 250. Emailed support 7 days ago. They said they think it was an error and will get back to me... so I'm (not so) patiently waiting.

Ah yes, the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"

Happy for you, stranger! I'd do the same if I could pay of my student loans and have some leftover. Congrats!

Cool analogy :)  
Quick note though - I think you mean shih tzu (toy dog breed from China) instead of shiatsu (Japanese massage method)

(UPDATE) Coinbase support got back to me within their 4-5   business day time frame and increased my limits for me. They gave me an increase on top of what I originally had, too. So I'm a satisfied customer.

I thought I was too late at $3500... and $4200... and $7400

I'm pretty sure you have to deposit funds into GDAX through your linked bank account (not credit card) and wait four days for the funds to become available in GDAX. Then you can place orders. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, please.

If you don't mind my asking, what program or app do you use that's allows buy and sell orders? Right now I'm on coinbase and looking to possibly move.
