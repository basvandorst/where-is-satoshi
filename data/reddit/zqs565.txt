You should NEVER have to do any of that.  This is disgusting.

They're charging me out the ass for my business.  You have no clue what you're talking about.  Visa has gone insane.
As everyone switches to bitcoin, transactions will be extremely cheap AND since it's essentially a deflationary currency, just saving gives you a loan--as it should be. 
In addition to this, we get the added benefit of central groups no longer being able to control the creation of money and the manipulation of all our political systems with that control.

It's upsetting to learn something new huh?  Doubling down on silliness won't change that though.  Don't feel embarrassed.  Most of us didn't know banks create money out of thin air at some point.  
By the way, the video I linked you to is literally an econ 101 course--you know the instructor that keeps saying banks create money out of thin air.  Maybe you missed that repeatedly.

Good luck using your Visa as businesses stop taking it.  It costs me way too much for my business personally.  We're growing sick of it.  
That "free" money you're getting aint free.  It hurts everyone in multiple ways.  1--it's just banks creating more money out of thin air watering everyone's value down. 2--If they aren't just creating money out of thin air, they're charging more for businesses to transact. 3--that whole money out of thin air things maintains absolute control over political structures which, obvious to most, works against the average person.  4--If I'm forced to take it, I'm charging you more.

Watch the video.  You're sorely mistaken.  At least hopefully you'll take this knowledge with you now and try to understand more.  
Commercial banks create the vast majority of new money.  
In case you're absolutely dead set on holding onto this notion, where does most new money come from?  When you eventually admit that banks create it, are they getting it from somewhere?  No, so thin air?  Lol.

Thanks!  I was some of those people.

Yes, banks create money out of thin air and that's not even considering what central banks do that we'll never be able to see. It amazes me how so few people know this or how money really works.  
 If you can't know the inputs, your money is a scam. 
     
Also, trust me when I tell you businesses are getting sick of dealing with Visa, Mastercard, etc.  I'm one of them.  As soon as bitcoin hits a certain threshold, businesses will certainly use it to transfer any kind of money vs Visa, etc.  
I wish I had caught this sooner so your lack of understanding couldn't confuse others.

Initial deposit of $100:
New money created $900:
  
Where did the new money come from?   Who created it?  
Straightforward questions a financial guru like yourself can educate us on.
@_date: 2019-03-10 08:28:42
Oh...ok.  I see.  So where did the new money come from?  Did it come from the concept?
@_date: 2019-03-10 15:04:23


It's a real simple question.  To prove your assertions, just answer it.  Where did the money come from?
  


Might want to check your wording when you're trying to offend someone.
Edit:  By the way, one of your links succinctly expresses the true modern state of banking.  


What this should tell you is that in modern banking the reserves on hand aren't even a limiting factor in money creation other than a penalty on the profit they can take in from the loans repayment.  So out of thin air AND with little restraint.

huh?  link please

Come on now, answer the question.  Where did the new money come from?  It didn't come from thin air right?  So where?
@_date: 2019-03-10 08:31:45
This money isn't even printed.  By the way, our Treasury prints the money but doesn't create it.   Just in case you're thinking that.  The money the treasury prints, it already has on hand.  When the Treasury prints money, it is NOT creating new money.  
The US govt. in no way, shape or form, creates new money.

In 10 years, there will be 300 million coins.  That's not that much compared to all the cryptos with a billion coins,etc.  
How long is your time horizon that you're worried about 300 million in 10 years and 3 billion in 100 years.   You plan on being around in 500 years?
It's not that much and nowhere near as many coins as others in or near the top 10.
