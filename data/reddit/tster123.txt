I think a "full reserve" system would devolve to a system with:
1) A "bank" account where you give them money and they do nothing with it until you ask for it back.  You will pay a percentage fee for this service.  Barely anyone will use this.
2) A "money market" account which is an investment account (and can lose money) which buys highly liquid, short-term securities and financial instruments.  The bank can make money off these things and pay some of it out to the account holders as dividends.  Everyone will use this.
The end result would be pretty much the same as today, just now instead of a "fractional reserve bank account" you have a "fractional reserve money market account"

This is similar to asking how much money it would take to get a court clerk to transfer your house and property into my name.  Aka, it's illegal.  Domain name disputes can be resolved using ICANN's Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy: [

Bitcoin isn't "full reserve" or "partial reserve".  I could create a "bank" which accepts deposits in bitcoin and then uses that bitcoin to make loans (and subsequently pay out interest on the deposits).  So long as my depositors are happy with the return on their deposits and the level of risk in the loans, and the short-term availability of their capital, everything is well and I have a fractional reserve bitcoin bank.

Do your suppliers actually price in bitcoin or do they price in fiat and accept bitcoin at market rate conversion?  If it's the latter, then you are still exposing yourself to bitcoin price fluctuations.

Banks do not conjure money from thin air.  A bank can only loan out money which it has deposited.
As for the rest, I'm just going to drop the argument here as I find your arguments utterly unconvincing as I'm sure you find mine to be the same.

Seems pretty clear that the bank is only lending out the $100 which are deposited into it (well, part of it).  Were does it say in there that they loan out money without having it deposited first?

You could do exactly the same thing with bitcoin.  A bank balance is just a credit that the bank owes you.

Sort of depends on how you define "portable".


Tell that to all the people who have lost their wallets.  In some ways bitcoin is the least durable way to store value.


Gold can be divided down to an atom.  Plus... who cares?


This makes no sense.  Cash is perfectly fungible...




Not 100% sure what you are talking about, but a physical transfer of cash or gold or diamonds or whatever would probably qualify.

Are you saying that the reason a bank won't give you a mortgage on a recent large deposit is that they think you might have just "conjured [the money] from thin air"?  That's not the reason.  They want to ensure that you were able to save up enough for a down payment and not just get it from someone else.  It's orthogonal to the concept of fungibility of the underlying currency.

Me and you seem to be (maybe) on the same page.  I was originally replying to cm9kZW8K who said:


If we all can agree that "bank balances" are the same as "cash" (I wasn't, but I can stipulate to treat it as such for this discussion) and that bitcoin and USD are equivalent in this regard, then this whole line of argument is pointless as it all started with the quote above, so there is no point in continuing.
Now, if you disagree with any of these statements, we might actually have a basis for a discussion:
1. A bank can only loan out a US dollar which it has deposited.
2. If a bank has 100 BTC deposited, there is no technical barrier for it to lend some of it out.
3. A US dollar can no more be conjured by a bank than a bitcoin can be.
4. Fractional reserve banking can expand the money supply of bitcoin just as well as it can expand the money supply of USD.
(The last 2 statements are really just a repackaging of the first two statements in different ways)

Do you mean, try to secure a mortgage with a down payment from a recent large deposit?   That's related to creditability, not fungibility.   Buying a house with a recent large purchase would not cause any problem.  How do you think bitcoinistas buy their lambos?
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:30:12
Actually in your hypothetical example 10 million was deposited by the fed.
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:00:30
that's interesting, but not related to the concept of fungibility.
Also, it's perfectly legal to carry $10k cash on a flight.  And buying a house or a car with cash is very easy as well.  I wouldn't bother carrying the cash (although it would be fine to do so), but rather use a check to transfer the cash.
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:38:36
Please explain or point me to a source explaining how a bank loans out money which it does not have deposited.

If this were true, the world would be a very poor place.  First, most of the world's wealth is denominated in low-inflation currencies.  Taking a non-weighted average of currency inflations is just silly.  Venezuela's economy is roughly 0.26% of the world economy; high inflation there doesn't have a material impact on the wealth of people elsewhere.   Furthermore, wealth isn't kept in currency.  Inflation doesn't change the underlying value of a house or a truck or a machine.

His advice has a lot of wisdom in it.  Getting out of the game of "if I had only bought at X and sold at Y" is an important step in financial maturity.  And his advice wasn't related to your "mistake" (actually no mistake was made) 8 years ago, but to your attitude about it now.

I do "sell" most of my USD for buildings, trucks, machines, intellectual property, etc.  That's the point I was making.
No, not all fiat currencies are pegged to the USD.  Examples: GBP, CAD, Euro, Yuan.

The government will demand it in tax payments, and if someone fails to pay their taxes they will be arrested.   So... backed by guns?
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:35:18
It creates a demand for the currency ("I need to have some of this to give to the government or else I will be thrown in jail and/or have my assets seized") which "prop\[s\] up the value".   As far is calling that "backing", you can call it whatever you like I guess ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

The same question could be asked of bitcoin.  What makes bitcoin so special that it will last when \[most\] other cryptocurrencies have failed?
