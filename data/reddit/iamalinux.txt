The basic model is releasing two versions.  A free and open source version and an enterprise version.  The enterprise version has a nice GUI and support.  The FOSS version does not come with support.  People use your software, fork your project, and submit patches back.  This puts the user in control of the software they run on their device.
With this project, it is a glorified cryptocurrency wallet.  Is it safe?  The developer says yes and you can use wireshark to verify.  That is not verifiable.  Say he set an event, if BTC price reaches 21,000 USD collect all to his private wallet.  Use software you can trust.
If you want to read more on the dangers of closed source software, look up Richard Stallman's books and the FSF website.

It works very well financially for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Jenkins, OpenEdX, and countless other projects.

In this case, it definitely is.

You could do that, but then you would be restricted by the terms of the license.
Typically, the fork is not as popular or well maintained because they did not actually write it from scratch.
The AGPLv3 license requires all derivative works to be licensed under the same license.
I would not trust a cryptocurrency wallet on a closed source app running on a system with binary blobs.  Use LineageOS and F-Droid at least.

First?  Cambridge, MA did it.
