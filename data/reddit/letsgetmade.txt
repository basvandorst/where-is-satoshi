Hey, thanks for the reply. A few things ;
- Have you used LocalBitcoins.com? are they recommended/safe in general?
- There are many suggestions in regards to wallets, and I am indeed aware that hardware wallets are best, but which mobile/desktop wallet do you recommend the most? On android for example, all the top used wallets have negative reviews, so I'm not sure what to go for. Eventually, I'll get a hardware wallet.
- Which bitcoin exchange do you suggest the most? I am European if that matters.
- How do I know Ii'm getting the correct value in bitcoin upon purchasing? Is there anything that is constantly showing what bitcoin is worth? google seems to bring up different numbers in regards to what bitcoin is actually worth at the moment. So what I mean is, how do I know I'm buying the correct amount of Coin for the money I'm putting in?
- And lastly, any opinion on LiteCoin?
Of course, you don't have to answer all of these, I'd appreciate any response, thanks!

So I can transport them to a regular USB drive? 
I'm looking for a basic-type method, I'm not that savvy.

I love how they raised the price on that, just a couple days ago it was 50 euro, now it's 70 euro. 
Maybe from all the damn promotion people keep giving it, lol.

Right, so I can store the wallet file on any storage device? 
So why spend 80 on a hardware wallet?

Which exchange would you recommend as a European tho? 
I'm having trouble getting verified because I hold a European passport -_-
What kind of bullshit is this?
