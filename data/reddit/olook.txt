You can't run smart contracts on Counterparty without XCP.
(The only things you can do with Counterparty without XCP are creating tokens a.k.a currencies, trading them on the decentralized exchange, and broadcasting text &amp; data onto the Bitcoin blockchain. These only require a Bitcoin transaction. Creating currencies is also possible in colored coins at the same cost. Decentralized trading is only possible on Counterparty, and broadcasting data into the blockchain is always possible.)
I'm assuming Symbiont will be doing far more complicated financial tools, markets, etc than regular old tokens. I've read that they are planning to continue smart contracts development on Counterparty. And all smart contracts require XCP to be burned.... Do the math.
They've employed the entire XCP dev team. No idea why anyone would have to ask such a question. At least it seems obvious to me.

It uses the Bitcoin protocol. Deflated Bitcoin by ~2100 BTC, and is deflationary (mildly) in itself. Most of its features only need BTC to use (sadly this is not possible with all features due to limitations of Bitcoin, but if someone finds a way then the devs would be more than happy to add it). 
The developers' intention was never to build an 'appcoin' or 'get rich' but to enhance the functionality and value of Bitcoin itself. It's more like a Bitcoin toolkit, than an 'appcoin'. But because its internal currency is listed on Coinmarketcap, people think its an "appcoin" that people want to use to replace BTC.
XCP will **never** replace BTC, and that isn't the point at all, unlike Mastercoin and NXT and Billcosbycoin or whatever

It assumes that they force you to use the appcoin instead of Bitcoin and undergo a funding process wherein the developers are sent money. Counterparty, an "appcoin" that lives on the Bitcoin blockchain, allows you to use Bitcoin freely and no money goes to the developers. 95% of the article fundamentally cannot be applied to it.
It also provides peer-to-peer betting, decentralized exchange, dividend payments, contracts for difference and more. I think these features and upgrades are powerful enough.
And it doesn't replace BTC, and it doesn't want to replace BTC like mastercoin does, it just wants to add features to BTC by working on the blockchain through proof-of-publication.
How is that not an exception?

The difference is that in Counterparty it already works.


So there is a separate entity for it, but it's not implemented within the protocol. The armory implementation isn't decentralized! Is the order matching even automatic? As far as I can tell, I can't find anything useable. Look at counterwallet for a counterexample (pun intended).


Is there anything like this planned for CC? 


It cannot be done with plain Bitcoins due to escrow and oracle functionality. Again, it would have to be a separate system. If you think you can do fully decentralized betting with Bitcoin alone, then please do. And saying "it can be done" is different than "it already works" as is the case with XCP. e.g.  , 
If you can demonstrate how decentralized CfDs and Betting can be done on Bitcoin only, you would be considered a coding deity and Stallman would cry crocodile tears at your feet. By all means, give it a go...
Counterparty supports Bitcoin for any feature where it is within the realm of technical possibliity. If you think you know better, please add the functionality. It should be relatively easy for you, since its written in concise Python.


Counterparty isn't a specific kind of coin either, it's a toolkit as well, but it has an internal currency to enable certain features and escrow, and it already has these features and they are **working today**. 


I am dismissing it because it is not one coherent entity, and barely any of of the functionality you describe is actually implemented in code, only in theory and forum posts. People cannot use promises and message boards to do their trading.
Counterparty works and has everything that is being 'promised' in a single, coherent implementation. Why should people wait for something that may be one day implemented with 10 different applications, when there is already a single solution today? I'm confused. It would make more sense for developers to build upon the existing Counterparty network. 
There was no Counterparty funding either, and yet development continues quickly.

@_date: 2014-06-23 06:52:43
Their only feature is to tag coins with a 'color'. That's it. 
Counterparty supports dividend payments (automatically distributed among asset holders), decentralized trading using XCP, user-created assets and BTC, peer-to-peer betting, contracts for difference, and a lot more. Functionality is constantly being added.
You wouldn't be able to crowdfund or issue shares with colored coins necessarily, and there is no decentralized asset exchange or automatic escrow. 
For example look at LTBCOIN or NICEPLUM or TATIANACOIN or SWARM on Counterparty, these are all assets launched with their own distinctive purposes. There is also the Bitcoin Tangible Trust, which offers derivatives for Gold and Silver.
LTBCOIN and TATIANACOIN allow you to trade it for LTB and TATIANA merchandize/services, NICEPLUM is a profit-sharing asset for a musician, and SWARM is the kickstarter of the bitcoin world that shares its fees with all holders of SWARMCOIN.
None of this is possible with colored coins, and in the future it would only be possible with 3rd party projects. For example, the colored coins wallet is actually proprietary, while the Counterparty one is open-source.
So, nothing is wrong with Colored Coins apart from not being able to incoroprate these features directly into the protocol, and it's just a few years behind.

Counterparty is incredible. I got on board months ago already. It's just very difficult for people to understand. It seems to be decentralized to the point where even Bitcoin supporters don't ike it... It's quite  weird. The simplest description of XCP (Counterparty) that I have come across would be "Project Decentrailze Wall Street".

Good joke, everybody laugh.
BTC address != IP Address != Person
How would anyone be legally able to prove that something two abstractions away from the actual individual was and STILL IS in his control?
What if the wallet was:
Stolen, Hacked, Borrowed, Gifted, Mixed and Tumbled
What if the IP is:
over a VPN, public proxy, public wifi, computer lab, tor, etc.
What if the individual:
Lost the keys? Or the wallet.dat file was deleted? What if another individual used the PC? 
What if the money was lost in an altcoin?
So by now we are at least 2 to 3 abstractions away from provable identity, and already require multi-dimensional reasoning to even infer that maybe on a slight possibility it is that person. 
In the end this amounts to something decidedly North Korean, since only a rumor is sufficient to condemn someone as guilty.

I find it much more convenient, and I don't ever have to deal with paypal customer support and their godawful existence. I love buying stuff online with Bitcoin, it's almost too easy.
In countries with corrupt banks and high fees, Bitcoin can literally save lives.
If my family had their money in Bitcoin, the government would have never been able to seize their funds under fraudulent pretenses. It took almost a decade of legal costs and 24/7 stress to discover that the reasoning was simply due to government corruption, and some funds were returned. The rest conveniently disappeared....
Even if they had bought at $1200 and sold at $350, they would still have more than now. And they would not be ripping out their hair over lawyer fees and others.

If I have understood it correctly then it works on a consensus-based federated node system. 
This means that there are many Counterwallet servers, and users are encouraged to run their own. This creates a system where they have to 'agree' with eachother in order for it to function, and the workload is spread accordingly. 
This is essentially a decentralized system.
"For instance, software such as Counterwallet may then utilize these backend servers in making API calls either sequentially (i.e. failover) or in parallel (i.e. consensus-based). For instance, with Counterwallet, when a user logs in, this list is shuffled so that in aggregate, user requests are effectively load-balanced across available servers."
Also your wallet details are definitely not centralized on the server: the passphrase never leaves the wallet and even transactions are signed within the browser. (The server never has access to your passphrase or finances, unlike a centralized service.)

Indeed, Mastercoin spent most of its funding on marketing and looking spiffy. As far as I know, XCP is managed by 3 developers, Xnova, Cityglut, Phantomphreak. They never asked for an IPO, did not do any marketing, and never made any claims for 'future' features.
They started on github, and the protocol was functioning before their website even existed.
Counterparty was trying to rely on "if you build it they will come", but it seems people are more receptive to marketing trickery and empty promises than actual code.

I don't disagree with this. However, there is a Desktop GUI client, as well as a command line client, and you can also run a Counterwallet node yourself. All you need is bitcoind and the counterparty client.


All I know is that there is a core dev team, a core spec, and a reference implementation. (Unlike Mastercoin...) This should help at least a bit. 


So the matching is not automatic like on Counterparty DEx? Or am I misunderstanding something. 


It was a fleeting comment made by one of the core devs. I guess will have to wait and see. I wish I knew more. 
P.S: Mastercoin is a fork of Bitcoind, Counterparty has its own client that communicates with Bitcoind.

They actually used a system that doesn't directly get them profit (proof of burn). This way we can be certain that they have a personal investment in the realization of their concept.
From what I've seen so far, counterparty seems to have some of the best coders in the crypto community... Counterparty is the most impressive work I've seen that is based on the blockchain. It's not even a currency in itself, it's like a Bitcoin decentraliezd expansion pack.
They even have Sergio Lerner and Peter Todd both spending a month on their code now as well.
Their goal is to improve security and optimization while adding new features.
Sergio has discovered and fixed a number of vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin protocol, a list of which may be found on Bitcoin.it.

Maidsafe is another blight on the incomplete solution that is Mastercoin. Their products don't scale. Their entire business model is hot air and fireworks. It's an absolutely fantastic idea (Maidsafe), but it's built on quicksand. I'm really worried how this will turn out. 
They spent millions and millions of dollars to PROMISE something that other people have already solved for free.
Mastercoin doesn't even have a consensus on whether an address contains a Mastercoin balance or not, because there are several different networks with different ideas of the 'truth'. 
The decentralized exchange on Mastercoin requires manual interaction and the delays (which could exceed 10min) will make it utterly unusable at higher volumes. It simply does not scale.

This is actually a good thing. It's what people who previously had a dire, gloomy outlook are saying. Even though Bitcoin is relatively consumer ready, these people are struggling with accepting the concept itself at all.
It's better if someone says "looks interesting, waiting for more developments" than mindlessly attacking it or saying it only has illegal uses... It's closer to the 'negative' opinion while still trying to persuade in a positive light. This way he doesn't look like a "Bitcoin fanatic", but still slowly contributes to progress.
This reads extremely close to what oldschool articles about the internet sounded like. "Neat, but not fully ready for the wider public." I find it encouraging. I'm personally waiting until the media discovers XCP Counterparty, when the project is a bit further along.

Sorry, but that is how real world media works. This isn't a 'nerd niche' anymore. High values attract people interested in high values... Every single newspaper in the world suffers from this issue, only their definition of 'positive' and 'negative' are different based on self-interest of upper management.
It seems Bitcoin allows people to find flaws and critique points that are utterly ubiquitous, but somehow focus them on a single entity while denying the rest.
It's important to emphasize that the Bitcoin executable is not the currency itself. The currency itself is the flow of social interaction between the person sending the coins, and the person receiving them. 
Because this traditional barter process now exists with a lot more emotional detachment, people tend to act more according to their own ego.

I think developers could easily build such a platform just by using [Counterparty]( It already has decentralized asset exchange,  dividend payments, CfDs, and other neat features. Along with Vennd.io and SWARM, this would fit nicely with the existing featureset. And it's a lightweight protocol running directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2014-06-24 09:43:24


Absolutely wrong. Are you a programmer? The Counterparty source code is relatively short and written in Python. If you can add it, do it. Most things can be done with BTC, but escrow for example cannot. 
The Counterparty team has half a century of combined programming experience, and most of them studied high-level mathematics. Literally everyone in the world would be impressed if you could prove them wrong. I'm sure the community would reward you with a bounty as well. So please, try.

I'm aware that Counterparty is not an appcoin technically, and just an extension to Bitcoin. It's just extremely difficult to explain the differences to people... But yes you are 100% correct. But people see its internal currency XCP (which is logically required for escrow...) listed on Coinmarketcap and think "o lol its an appcoin".
But people make the same argument about Mastercoin (which aims to replace Bitcoin and actually IS an appcoin), and it's really difficult to explain.
I'm glad people are beginning to understand the differences, because there's no point in funding worthless "appcoins" with thousands of BTC when there is an alternative that never asked anyone for anything and provides it for free.

Colored coins can only color coins, nothing else.
Mastercoin requires you to send a certain BTC amount to the exodus address every time you do something (directly in the foudners pocket) and imposes a 0.3% fee on trading user-created assets. It also artificially restricts the use of Bitcoin in order to inflate Mastercoin price. Not only that, but its a FORK OF BITCOIND, making it unmanagable.
It is unfair to compare it to Counterparty, which does not impose any limitations or fees on its users, and works by communicating with the API rather than replacing it. It's like comparing Bitpay/Coinbase to Neo&amp;Bee.... One of them actually has solutions, the other one is a profit hungry marketing scheme.

Was their card finished? Did they have a working machine prototype?
Maybe I'm wrong, but I can't really understand how they would make all the money back and then turn a profit. At first I was hooked as well, but I didn't trust Havelock investments (I'm not buying shares until a decentralized financial market like Counterparty reaches the public) and didn't like the idea of throwing my money in the dark.
The allure of NeoBee was there, and I almost fell for it as well. But a little bit of research would have shown that it's a shaky premise, and it would be better to wait.

Again, to provide a contrast. The 2.0 platform Counterparty never asked for funding, and all BTC 'invested' were sent to a provably unspendable address. Therefore the developers got 0 of it, but it nonetheless established the value of the currency. Everyone had equal opportunity.

I tried this once. Paypal kept telling me I have to add a credit card despite the fact that I have a verified account with a bank acc. 
I called Paypal support and they held me on the $1 per minute line, until they finally just blamed "malware", despite the fact that this occurred across 2-3 computers with different OS and internet connections.
So I spent $20 in a phone call, only to have Paypal representatives tell me that they "don't know what caused it" and "dont know how to fix it". Then my account got frozen for 'investigation', unfrozen without any explanation, but the problem was still not resolved. I emailed them, and still nothing was fixed.
This was last year. To this day, I am not able to send money from my paypal account without 'adding a credit card' despite having an upgraded and verified account. I transferred all my money back into my bank acc and bought Bitcoins instead.
While all this was going on, my friend was scammed through the chargeback function and lost $1000.

Just build a sports betting system on top of Counterparty (XCP). That way you can trade BTC for XCP on the decentralized exchange within the client, and place bets.

You mean one of the administrators of SR2 who is in on this denies it? Wow ok, cool
Read about transaction malleability.. assuming sr didnt verify payments this would still take thousands of fraudulent purchases and STILL wouldnt be a bitcoin glitch but a result of really awful coding on the part of SR2. And thats unlikely, considering they have been piling up user funds in their hot wallet for ages without answering support..

Is that a philosophical question?

I heard from a business connection that they're using Counterparty soon (who are allied with [Senahill]( and [Ripple]( anyone else know anything about this?

Isn't that what the gateway is for?

MSC is a fork of Bitcoind... very bad design decision. And you're right, it's not sustainable.
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:54:30
It's referring to the fact that the counterparty risk is removed. It lets you keep your money on the blockchain while trading cryptoequities, instead of storing them on an exchange or in the hands of someone else... 
But yes, the broadcasts have to orginate from trusted feeds.

I managed to listen to 2 hours of this garbage, and all of it sounds like it was created by a random sentence generator. It's the stupidest thing I've heard in a while. I can't make any sense of any single statement made there.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:04:02
Yeah, I'm aware of this. But their press release they are using that  'initially' as if to move to something with more functionality, and the connections of the [Symbiont]( team (Ripple, MathMoney FX, Coinbase, Lockheed, etc.) made me take the claim seriously... It makes some sense that smart contracts would be the next step, but they're not ready for NASDAQ yet.
I've heard a lot about smart contracts being brought into the Wall Street space... And I don't think they'll be using Ethereum (since NASDAQ have now shown themselves to be Bitcoin maximalists publically). They could make their own implementation, but I fail to see why? Maybe CC is enough?
Might've been wishful thinking... I heard it from someone who isn't involved with any of the mentioned projects. A lot of gossip in the Bitcoin world, naturally.
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:31:15
That's why increasing block size at this stage, without even considering other scalability issues is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2015-05-17 18:33:39
I _personally_ know a handful of people who are getting paid to do this. Coinfire is [reporting about it]( The most frequented reddit location is an AIRFORCE BASE according to [reddit itself]( and they spend thousands of hours to create studies like [this]( 
If you take a look on [oDesk]( once in a while, you can find job offers that are exactly in this field. 
Many science blogs are actually disabling comments because such behavior is more likely to sway opinion than positive posting. Here is one [source]( 
It's laughable to think that all the industries that are endangered by Bitcoin wouldn't be investing chump change into something that the Chinese and U.S. government have been doing for years.
There are entire _industries_ dedicated to this purpose. PR, propaganda, social influence, call it what you will. Maybe some other users here can speak up about receiving private PM's inciting them to be paid for something like this. I've seen that before as well.
What makes this sub look crazy is people salivating over anything Bitcoin related without even researching what it is. But whatever.
Nowadays all our conversations can be surveilled and broadcast through our mobile devices even the battery is removed, and you think competitive companies paying a people to be dicks is far fetched?
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:58:10

Transactions costs will rise, and block sizes can be increased in the future to prevent rapid centralization.

Woah. I knew Counterparty would be the leading 2.0 platform, but I honestly never expected this.

If they fork Counterparty for a pre-funded ledger it would be the biggest display of idiocy since Karpeles.
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:16:23
It accounts for about 3-4% of all Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:15:05
I'm not surprised, since even [the former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange invested in Symbiont / XCP](
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:11:17
From what I've seen the XCP devs are far too educated to do something like that.

Expecting Bitcoin not to help Greece significantly (capital controls, 'haircuts', etc) is like saying fax is enough.
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:20:23
You don't even need smart contracts for trading. Not even XCP. You can create tokens with Counterparty and trade them using only BTC dust. (On the decentralized exchange, etc).
This works **today**. And you can also make proof-of-publication using BTC only. Counterparty has some awesome features, and smart contracts will do _much_ more impressive things than just trade.

It's not. Both are still using Counterparty. It's just members of the core team that moved from Overstock to Symbiont. Overstock then hired a different team, supposedly.

The transactions are prunable, pay miners per data stored, and contribute to the financial ecosystem. And just a few years ago a megabyte cost thousands of dollars. 
10 minute block time is more than enough for the main purpose of Counterparty: secure, _high_ value transactions and contracts.

Don't you dare ever copy code! Bitcoin should have been written in assembler, because they shouldn't copy all the C++ libs and security algorithms. You know what, don't even use Windows or Linux, make your own OS and drivers from scratch. Copying is EVIL, especially in the open-source world...
(Jokes aside, Counterparty didn't copy Mastercoin, nor Ethereum. They ported ethereum smart contracts to Bitcoin.)
Sure they could have made their own smart contracts, but then it wouldn't be 100% compatible with Ethereum. So people will only have to write their contracts once. The logic is sound. :)
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:28:50
There is even an article called [Mastercoin is a nightmare of insanity]( ...
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:15:50
By "Overstock deal dies", you mean the Counterparty devs leaving voluntarily and one of them staying as an advisor? Because that's what happens. Also, look at VERSUM. It's not impossible to have thin clients.
