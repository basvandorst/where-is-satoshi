Thanks for your reply. You are correct. I just feel misled by the info i received on bitcoin, people selling it as a cheap way to make transactions. It's not cheap if you have to pay £5 just to get started is it? I mean they used to give free bitcoins to new members. Now you have to pay. What if I just want to do a small transaction to test things out?

Or even if I want to buy £20 worth of bitcoin, then they are charging me 25%. Surely there's a cheaper way to buy bitcoins?

What you mean like look on classified adverts? Meet up with a guy and get the code transfered to me digitally and give him cash? That's weird.
@_date: 2015-06-14 02:42:11
What other ways? Regardless of where the fee goes it still has to come from my pocket, so there is room to make things more economical. I can't believe everyone is buying bitcoins like this. 
I appreciate your response however with all the ecommerce options these days can you see the flaw in a £5 fee? 
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:03:59
Your reply isn't helpful. You need to explain more. I'm new to this.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:29:54
any ideas?

Coinomi allows total customisation! Yay for coinomi.
 Mycelium allows some choice but the smallest fee is still too high.

It's most compatible with mainland European bank payments. They have a Telegram group:

There's one decentralised exchange I've heard of called Bisq.   They don't charge a withdrawl fee and you can set the miner fee as you like.

Thanks. Great post. We have no equivalent to bitonic.nl in the UK. (You know we are the old headquarters of the banking mafia).
So I tried to send to a paper wallet from my blockchain.info account.  
Sending a micro amount like 10 cents worth has a transaction fee of £1.00 (euro 1.19) worth of BTC.... that seems really high to me. IS this what everyone is paying?

How do I transfer my uh, "balance" to another wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:32:10
Yeah sure if you send me the Ether first. xD

Jaxx allows BTC to Ether.

Thanks for the explanations. It became apparent in under an hour. 
As for your latter opinion... don't need that. How well some people think they know someone after seeing a post on reddit.

Upvoted for the free article! How did you find that, you mini genius?

If satoshi is holding still, what is his public address so we can check it?
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:52:12
Upvoted. Can you explain how to understand the congestion in the mempool? I think I looked before at some webpage and just didn't understand.
@_date: 2017-07-04 17:20:58
Is there any way to check my mycelium seed written on paper, is correct. You know. Just to make sure....

Coinbase are crooks!
Bittylicious have good reviews.
Google: UK Bitcoin buy online, then find one with a good website and check the reviews by going a follow up search.

BTC does closer to 3 per second. But that will improve in August.
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:20:29
Why did you decide to give away .2 btc? Do you have a lot spare? 
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:38:13
You can, if you can have a network that supports it. I believe. I might be wrong though. The issue is, there's not the support yet. Miners are waiting until the latest moment so they can extract the maximum fees.

 Kraken is miles ahead of the rest in that comparison, the only one measured in millions of coins on the 24hr chart.

How do you know the byte size?
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:28:24
So you sent $2 and paid up to an extra $5 in transaction fees, or less depending on the speed. How much did you pay and how long did it take?
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:04:45
Thanks for your reply but honestly I have no f@ idea what all that means. 
What is the range of fees that are good these days, min to max?  Assuming we want 10 min tx time.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:19:06
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:11:53
Might be true. Maybe it's due to the UK banks refuse to work with Bitcoin businesses. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:40:52
Even currencies designed from the ground up to be pegged to the USD have fluctuations. Therefore, consider that the yen and gold are completely different. Then the resemblance becomes more interesting.

The best wallet is a paper wallet for long term use. You can google paper Bitcoin wallet. I suggest bitaddress.org . 
Then print them off. 5 address/ key paid to a page is good. For top security, use each wallet address and private key pair only once. 
If you have a smartphone, i suggest mycelium. 
Both of these methods mean you get to keep control of your wallet keys and not trusting it to some website.

I'm not sure what lightening network is. But if it means off chain, then there's virtually no limit to the number of transaction per second.
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:50:33
Are you deliberately being opaque to confuse?
