It is possible, but so far people mostly treat them as fungible. There aren't any marketplaces for bitcoins with an interesting tx history. I think one thing that makes it somewhat unsatisfying is that in order to safely take possession you need to move the BTC to a new address making it ever more removed from whatever the interesting history was. Admittedly this could perhaps change if block explorers were able to more concisely visualize the relationship. Exchanges are known to look at transaction history and may ask for more source of funds documentation if a deposit appears connected to a reported crime transaction.

Yea. If you ask any bank their official policy is gonna be that they don't allow it - that's different than there being any technical restrictions on doing it.
It seems that what's happened is someone got a transaction declined (dunno why) and asked the bank about bitcoin and they said it wasn't allowed and this became a thing on twitter.. but probably the same scenario can occur with most banks and really nothing has actually changed and people can still buy BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-27 05:16:09
Imagine you just make a chain of BTC transactions sending all your funds from one new address to another in a big chain. Now from the Blockchain evidence noone can know that all those addresses are yours.. even if say you reveal that the first and last address are yours it's still possible that the funds were sent through multiple other people and just coincidentally ended up back in your possession at the end. Noone can prove that wasn't the case from the Blockchain evidence alone. It's possible that you have no way to identify any of the parties in the middle of the chain. It's possible, but coinbase may still freeze your account until you do. Similarly with your two own ln nodes, the funds that you cash out of the second ln node could in theory not be resulting from any payment from your first ln node but if people were willing to just accept that then really you could just launder BTC by making a BTC tx that merely looked like a payment channel. Like there's no need to use actual ln.. they probably won't accept it though. It will probably be seen as your responsibility to conduct source of funds investigation of your channel partners. Payments become fungible but it just moves the problems to the (onchain) channel funding transactions.

When you broadcast the transaction your IP is visible to your peers and intel agencies that wiretap everything. Some of your peers may report your IP to (or more likely be run directly by) Blockchain intelligence / tracking companies. They know you are the origin simply because they haven't seen it from anyone else yet.
Also all bitcoin websites are behind cloudflare which probably allows intel agencies to track all withdrawals from exchanges and payments to websites that accept bitcoin via bitpay or a similar intermediary.

@_date: 2019-07-27 04:53:42
The problem is you need to setup payment channels with peer nodes. At the moment everyone is fairly permissive about doing this, but that might not always be the case. Ln nodes might need to kyc you before opening a channel, and more relevantly they might do chain analysis on your channel source of funding and might refuse to open the channel if you are using "tainted" BTC to fund.

With global wiretapping I expect it would be highly accurate. Even the more amateur efforts seem to get decent results in the past just by running a thousand nodes. It doesn't have to work every time either as you still have the rest of the Blockchain analysis stuff.. so if you ever talk to an analyst node and reveal your IP then it's now a candidate address for all linked transactions.

Once a transaction has been confirmed, it can't be altered. Unconfirmed transactions are just that - unconfirmed.. they are candidate transactions and you don't know if they will be replaced before confirming. So the solution is to wait for the Blockchain.

Imo wirex is fine, but withdraw some BTC to your own bitcoin wallet on your phone, or a hardware wallet like trezor. Leaving a large balance on a custodial wallet (one where you don't hold the private keys) is inherently putting yourself at the mercy of that provider.

The only way a bank can get a central bank deposit for its IOU is if an investor buys it with central bank money (in modern times the central bank may buy the IOU itself which does create new money). Otherwise the IOU is just stuck in the bank that issued it.. maybe you can call it money.. I mean the bank can use it to pay their own customers (credit their accounts) and other banks will take it into consideration when setting credit limits so you could maybe argue that it's partially transferrable to other banks.. but it's still qualitatively different than real cash or central bank deposits.

Yea that's what I thought you meant.. but classifying bitcoin as currency will not achieve that. I actually don't think a change in law is necessary either; as long as shops don't have to kyc their customers people spending BTC directly can't really be taxed effectively as there isn't really any documentation for the IRS to audit.

You can export individual keys from bitcoin core as a text string and delete the wallet.dat.

There are some sites that basically have a bank of prepaid SIM cards with different numbers. When an SMS arrives they post it on the site. These are mainly used to create accounts on services.that require a phone number. I guess people sometimes use them to create telegram accounts. Because these phone numbers are public anyone can probably reset the password and recover it. I guess that's what the op did and then found this old conversation. Most likely one or both of the parties is a scammer trying to rip off the other using a telegram account opened using a public phone number.

In the early days of bitcoin people traded using PayPal and didn't have problems. Just because it works now in a small technical community doesn't mean it will always work.

Well the point was that even a bad payment system like PayPal can work in a small community. Maybe your system will have its niche.

Bitstamp probably works. Downside is you can only deposit/withdraw by swift.. but I don't think they'll care about you using a us bank acct.

The mass surveillance is rather depressing, but I don't think bitcoin will fix it. What do private transactions matter when your location, social graph and really every website you've ever visited is known? I would like to see more privacy on chain, but it almost doesn't even matter anymore.
Bitcoin can't solve every problem. Engaging with existing financial companies absolutely will bring lots of new users. It's like with ipv6 for almost 20 years very little adoption and then in the last two years a few big telcos just turn it on for all their subscribers and it goes from like 10% to 90% (on that network) in one day.

I would still recommend kraken. Bitstamp coinbase and coinfloor are ok too.
@_date: 2019-12-09 16:22:14
No. At least not without showing id so they can sue you if you double spend. With a card you have a relationship with the bank and in theory they can still get the money from you.. even though that rarely happens it's probably a deterrent, and without it people will probably do it a lot more.
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:18:00
Bitstamp has a 5% card deposit fee which is higher than coinbase. That said you probably could get it to work by talking to customer services at your card issuer.
@_date: 2019-12-03 01:57:29
Might do - people are generally short of cash around Christmas, so they may be more likely to sell or hodl rather than buy right now.

It would also be worth looking for a birth certificate and a Canadian passport.

Probably not to hodl it.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:47:08
Yea but it's 10% of the added value, not 10% of the eventual retail price.. so it doesn't just add up like you seem to suggest. If one link in the chain is just reselling with a 10% markup and the vat is 10% then that hop only adds 10% of 10% (which is 1%) in tax to the end price. The middle men may pay the vat but they also claim back the vat that they paid out, so the gov only gets the difference which is the tax on their markup/value add.
@_date: 2019-12-17 08:22:32
True, but not really a good feature imo. If a bank goes insolvent you have a general claim on whatever is left of the banks assets. If you invest in a mortgage and it goes bad the asset is going to be impaired. It's not at all clear that you'd be better off.
@_date: 2019-12-27 19:27:41
The euro is now free and instant to transfer too.. so yea it's not a major selling point for crypto anymore.

I'm not confident of that.
@_date: 2019-12-02 11:50:50
I would not trust any of these.
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:37:59
I kind of agree, but we've had 10 years, and it turns out most people won't do anything they think might not be legitimate even if it is. The few who have adopted it and only do P2P but won't after they have to kyc or act illegally, sorry but it doesn't matter. The gain of new legal kyc users will far more than compensate.

I took out a regular bank loan to buy BTC (not trading). I'm currently up so don't regret it but just buying smaller amounts each payday would have been more comfortable and I'll probably go back to that after the loan is paid off.
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:37:58
There's omnilayer which builds arbitrary tokens like tether on top of bitcoin. You still need to pay fees denominated in real bitcoin to create those transactions though.
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:50:39
You are still calculating as if the gov gets 10% of the price at each stage. They do not. They get 10% of the difference between the upstream vendor and the downstream vendor - 10% of the 15%. The total tax the gov receives in this example is 2.01 * 0.10 or $0.20 taking the retail price to $2.21 not $3.24. The product manufacturer or importer pays the most vat since they created the most value. 11.5 cents. The first reseller pays 1.725 cents, the next 1.9 cents, the 3rd 2.2 cents the 4th reseller pays 2.6 cents. They of course charge all this forward to the end buyer who ends up shelling out the full 20 cents in tax.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:58:14

@_date: 2019-12-28 07:23:40
No. You need to recompile. Install libzmq and make sure it gets found when you configure the build.

The point is that there's a wide variety of quality of life you can live when you aren't paying for things with money. Some people are dying some are doing fine. Whether they have $2 per day or $3 per day or $0 per day is not going to be a major factor.

Yea that definition is stupid though. Noone lives on $2 per day. Some places just aren't as financialized. If someone is living on $2 per day it just means they are getting everything for free or perhaps in exchange for work or by favour of others in the community. If you rocked up and didn't know anyone they wouldn't feed and house you for $2 per day because it's not worth it.
@_date: 2019-12-21 14:48:40
I'm guessing you need to show id.
@_date: 2019-12-17 11:43:58
Imo it's a good thing. It will allow banks to get involved. The downside is that people won't legally be able to transact without kyc, but most people aren't doing that anyway and those that do will probably still do it even if it's illegal.

Everyone is saying OTC but for a few million you could get a better price just trading on the exchange.. after all that is basically what the OTC desk is going to do anyway before adding on their fee.

If you just type localbitcoins.com (without https) into tor browser there is every chance you're actually logging into a fake site. Anyone running an exit node can choose to serve a fake site instead of the real one.

When you withdraw from an exchange, you usually get totally different coins back out than you deposited. The exchange will know but presumably your friends won't (unless the exchange leaks the info to them).

You can attack a pay to scripthash address by iterating a nonce inside some part of the script that doesn't do anything.. so the functional part of the script just redeems using your own key and the nonce is incremented until the hash collides with the original script. The computational difficulty of incrementing the nonce and checking the hash might be less than incrementing the private key, generating the pubkey and then hashing that.

It's actually a lot like investing in stocks. Basically the price is driven by supply and demand. When you buy BTC and withdraw it, you are reducing the supply. When you buy at a broker, it's more like making a side bet on what people actually withdrawing will do, without influencing the outcome yourself. When you buy stocks it's supposed to reduce the supply too, but because of numerous accidental and deliberate record keeping deficiencies it doesn't.
