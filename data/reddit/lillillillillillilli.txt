Hang on to as many BTC as you can stomach?  Whether thats 0.0124 or 4149, its probably a good idea to at least have some.  BTC could go moonward or fail miserably.  Don't "bet the farm" or never acquire any.  Acquire more than zero, but not enough that you lose sleep over the risk.

You would need to print a paper wallet and put it in a safe deposit within a bank.  I don't know of any "banks" (besides Coinbase) who will hold Bitcoin conventionally.

That ad was made fairly recently and was always intended as a joke to spark interest and lols.

No one get cocky!  Anyone who's been following Bitcoin a few years knows "easy come, easy go." But... yeah... to the moon!

Sorry, I was quick to judge.  I'd definitely try imaging it bit-for-bit (if its accessible).  Otherwise, I'd check on getting the controller changed by a pro.  I wish you the best.  Losing Bitcoins is painful and I wish you success!

Yes, 2 years ago was fairly recent.  Now get off my lawn.  :-P

Silly poor people.  They should just put more money in their account so it doesn't run out.  I don't understand their problem.  /s

When you transfer fiat, the transaction is hardly ever 100% permanent.  You can always refute the transaction with your bank or credit card company and normally the "customer is always right."  When you transfer Bitcoin, the transaction is **forever** and **irreversible**.  This causes those with Bitcoin to be very leery of receiving fiat because they can't be 100% certain the transfer is final for days or even months (unless of course its a physical cash buy).  This leads to most of the difficulty you speak of buying BTC.

Be sure the buyer has legitimate currency (feel texture, check watermark of 50s/100s, etc.).  Keep in mind you are providing a service and incurring risk.  IMO 10% is a very fair mark-up (15-20% is possible).  Consider charging a flat fee or set a minimum purchase amount.  The coins may be heading directly to the darknet, so you may want to tumble and broadcast the transaction through a VPN.

The same reason you (most likely) trust  cryptographic protocols such as TLS when you login to your bank account.  Even if you didn't personally write the code that makes it happen, you (most likely) trust that widely-used and heavily-scrutinized software work as intended.

That seems kinda shady that you are so quick to accept a $7,700 loss (while expecting someone else to take a $8,300 gamble).  It wouldn't cost anywhere close to that to have the drive professionally recovered.

But these blockchain things are all the rage these days!  Millennials love altcoins and are eagerly waiting for banksters to make their own!  /s

At the moment, 8.3% of all nodes are "voting" for larger blocks by running the XT client.

The problem is that income for the median Americans have decreased over the past 8 years (while the overall gains in income you speak of went to a small group at the top).
