Then you choosing commenting seems a weird choice. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:07:23
You make absolutely no sense?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:57:38
Great argument. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:13:30
Do you want a round of applause?

Nah thanks eh. Thousands of dogs die because they don’t get adopted. By buying a dog instead of adopting one, you’re basically killing a dog that could’ve been adopted. (Action effect)
Yes sure, downvote because you don’t want to feel conscious about it.

Could’ve kept the bitcoin and adopted instead of supporting a breeder. 
Thousands of dogs are euthanized every single day because people are selfish enough to buy a dog rather than adopting one. 
Go ahead, downvote me, say ‘found the vegan’ and shit like that.  Tell me ‘well it’s their choice’ — doesn’t mean a dog which could’ve been adopted isn’t currently getting a euthanasation syringe.

The problem is people like you think it only affects you, when some dog is now getting euthanized because this guy/girl bought a dog instead of adopted one. It doesn’t just affect you, the dog too.

I assume it steals all bitcoins sent to the which is supposed to be 'your wallet'.

In this case this would not have mattered, since the malware and the signature come from the same website and match. 
Most people that would fall for this scam probably have no idea what signatures are and if they do they probably don't know a different source to find.

Are you by any chance using OS X?
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:05:16
It's gone on my end too! Thanks everyone who reported!
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:55:21
How can I with such a user name?
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:22:18
Thank you, I have sent them an email and will call a bit later today as well.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:51:18
Awesome, thanks!

Please report this and explain in the bottom text box why this is such a fuck up on Google's side.

Does anyone know if reporting this to Comodo, the SSL Certificate issuer of the scam site is going to help in any way? Will they possibly revoke it? Or do they not care as long as their ToS aren't being broken?

Hides the problem, doesn't fix it.
