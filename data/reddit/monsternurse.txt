Hahaha!!! For REALS!!!!! I️t all looks fucking fishy all the other exchanges had BCH @ 2500 or more and damn Bittrex had it at 2100 and was stuck, should have sold it even higher and then switch it to bitcoins,.....
or should have bought straight from BCH to BTC when it hit 5500 BTC and 2200 BCH oooohhh well you can’t win all of them

What a BULL RUN!!! Cashed out my bitcoins @ 7200 (should have been @ ATH of 7400) and bought BCH @ 1200 and bought back bitcoin at 5600dlls,...... HODL-ing the KING

Hahahaha - keep on pumping on bitcoin huh!!!!
Well shit, I’m looking for a undervalued alt-coin that will increase in percentage,..... even at 7500/bitcoin I’m still buying, but holding others than can also make a substancial jump would be a good idea too

I️ don’t get it, what’s the relationship? Can someone please explain. How do you know it’s a pump and dump? and where is the money coming from? For example the first pump and dump BCH had that everyone said it came from KOREA

Let’s keep it at 4500-5500 while we stock up because at the end of it goes to 10k or 15k it will go Toby he moon and then we all are fucked
