Why didn't this occur in December, which had a "small" holiday season of its own? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:29:31
This post does nothing to explain why the demand for Bitcoin doesn't match the supply. If the Bitcoin price is sound, a small dip should make it more attractive for buyers, hence the price stays somewhat stable.
Is this a common phenomenon in fiat money? What's the difference? We have during December many people around the world who buy USD to purchase gifts online.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:21:39
So? According to this post logic, we should have seen some dip. Maybe smaller, but *a* dip. And yet December took us to unprecedented heights

What happened to the original post?

That in most cases *can* rely on fiat money to have an inflation in a certain, sensible range

From your perspective, effectively that is exactly what you're doing. Your Euro balance did not change, and before deciding to buy the croissant you've  converted it in your head to USD.
From the French pastry perspective, you have used Euro. But that's because *their* Euro balance have changed. It will be hard for you to find a pizzeria that will keep your Bitcoin rather than selling it immediately.
So in your story, the Bitcoin had no role other then adding fees. Your USD, however, have proven their usefulness both as measure of value and as medium of commerce.

I'm truly amazed by the fact that OP and general sentiment here think that the list of crushes above indicates the Bitcoin resilience, while in fact it's a demonstration of an unreliable asset, a useless coin and a ridiculously prone to be stolen commodity. If anything, this list shows how the more time passes by, the more denegerous Bitcoin becomes. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:32:09
I'm referring to the notion that you should always aim to produce more and buy more. Which I thought was what you criticized by saying "Earth destroying consumption of resources"
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:55:55
Because the Bitcoin transactions cancel each other (neglecting fees), the only difference is that you have gained a pizza and gave away USD

Hmmm but you're using the capitalistic system as means to spread your deflationary money. What I've learned from history is that there are not many human ideas stronger than capitalism. I would not bet on the deflationary money in this competition.

Is the Bitcoin *a coin*? If so, the price *is* the tech. Nobody uses gold and silver as currency anymore just because Fiat money is a superior currency tech.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:03:35


This can hardly describe the Bitcoins value grows curve.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:04:53
Please note that my argument is not only that Bitcoin is unstable, but also that it functions as an asset rather than currency, but have no real properties of an asset.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:14:52
As far as I know, the science of economics says you can't predict the market using history
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:19:53
So if it's not a currency, what real value does it have?
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:57:07
But why would anyone need a "coin" whose value is "growing over time"? If it's a means of commerce, why should the long term matter more then it's extreme volatility, that makes it impossible to price anything using it?  And if the Bitcoin is useless as a coin, why should it be valuable as an asset? Why should it have a long-long-term value of anything more than zero? This list just exposes how any definition of Bitcoin contradicts the other to the point none of it makes sense
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:14:07
I'm fascinated by the sociological aspects of it
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:51:04
So you say that fiat currency replaced gold because it's easier to put it in your pocket?
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:15:25
My fiat is fine, doing what it should - enable me buy things and store my savings. I can roughly tell how much anything worth in fiat, and I sleep well knowing that this value will stay relatively the same when I wake up
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:39:56
Yeah well your Bitcoin doesn't solve their problem
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:01:27
The federal reserve keep printing money so even though the market cap grows, your cash *looses* a slight amount of *real value* every year. Bitcoin holders on the other hand experience significant gains over time.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:05:51
I'm not sad. I was curious to see how my analysis would be received here and what kind of responses it will get. I'm not disappointed
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:11:38
The Bitcoin should have the basic properties of a fiat to be a useful coin, not the other way around. Is it a medium for commerce? Does it store value? Is it a metric for value? Not really; it's volatility disrupts all of these properties. You hold the Bitcoin to gain interest and this is the exact reason why it's a useless coin.

In my country, if a bank is hacked they are backed by some insurance that keeps my money safe. If my credit card is stolen, I simply cancel it and any purchase made by thieves is canceled and refunded. A bank or credit company cannot run away with my money or assets, because they are legally responsible and operate under regulation. It is very rare for someone to hack a bank account because any operation is traceable, which makes stealing much riskier.

People buy computers now and not next year because they need a computer to produce some value out of it (be it money or some personal utility). During this year, most computers will create more value than the rise in price.
Say I bought a 1 BTC worth PC on 1.1.2017. By 1.1.2018, the BTC value rose more than 10 times. The real value of a new PC did not rise as much.

I'm unaware of anybody returning to use gold as a currency
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:54:54
Central banks put much effort into "knowing" and determining what the inflation rate. They are not always successful, but Bitcoin is nothing to compare in that regard
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:20:10
Huh? Inflation / deflation is defined by market value
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:47:53
But then you're just buying a pizza using USD :|
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:38:56
Why should the "hyperbitcoinization" (huh?) ever be complete?
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:04:03
Am I trolling? Have I written anything other than legitimate arguments? Have I been inflating in any way?
I'm trying to understand how people here settle what seems to me as a paradox. I got various answers that approach it from many angles. Hence, not disappointed
