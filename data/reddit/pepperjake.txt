It's not recommended by ledgers instructions. Block rewards are microtransactions and for whatever reason Ledger says it would create difficulties when trying to compound those microtransaction into a larger one when ready to spend. I'm sure someone else can elaborate

Transaction wait times are long relative to other cryptocurrencies but still incredibly short relative to credit/debit card payments.
The blockchain certainly couldn't handle the transaction volume of Amazon... Right now. The technology is advancing though. A bitcoin-litecoin transaction was validated on lightning network testnet last week I believe. That's huge! 
Even if it isn't used as the everyday currency I could see it being used as a store of value and for major purchases like cars and real estate where those fees and transaction times would be irrelevant.
If nothing else, its scarcity, identity, and origin story make it desirable. It will always have value.

Maybe deposit enough to meet the withdrawal limit and take it right back out

What percent transaction fee do your atms charge?

I got one off amazon and tried to set it up but the ledger bitcoin chrome app that you need to use it won't recognize that the wallet is connected so I can't put bitcoin or ethereum on it. I was able to add some litecoin though. Anyone else have this problem?

Are customers buying your bitcoin from you directly or do you link the customer to an exchange so you don't have to have the coin on hand to sell?

I can put litecoin but not bitcoin and ethereum 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:31:18
Yep. Did everything I did with litecoin but no recognition of a logged in nano from the chrome app when I try to open the bitcoin and ethereum apps on the nano

Picked the bitcoin app on the nano. No recognition from the chrome app. Browser support is on and I am logged into the nano
