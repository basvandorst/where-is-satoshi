LOL. Found the guy that missed the boat.

If this is the biggest criticism for it, then it should paint a pretty bullish landscape for anyone investing in the mid-long term.
Because this problem is already solved and will roll out quite soon..
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:02:38
Think about what you just said for a second.
If everyone knows that keyword=currently, then why would there be a mass exodus? People will wait for it to play out thus your whole theory falls apart.

Why pay for a gym membership with fiat when you can use that money to buy crypto and enjoy gains instead?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:06:30
do payment channels on the LN have to be manually opened the first time by the user?
In other words, does it require any extra steps from the user/merchant or is it all seamless/behind the scenes?

Actually, you can toggle AWD vs FWD. So you can use it only when you need it.
I live in Canada where it is snowing for a few months of the year and AWD is indispensable in the winter. I'm sure it snows in other countries too.
Also, no the Mazda 3 feels significantly more cramped, especially the rear seats.

It's a solved problem (the best kind of problem!) with the upcoming Lightning Network. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:14:48
lol. woosh. 
That was exactly my point. The fact that you can use a currency as to invest in something with a return does not make it any less viable as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:21:33
Did this woosh over your head too?

This needs to be voted to the top.
The best way to hurt them is by destroying their app store rankings. 
Go on the App Store (Google Play for Android, or the App Store for iOS) and give them a 1 star.
Vote this to the top.

More seats

And many other reasons why people buy SUVs over tiny hatch backs

Hahahah love this comment.

Say you have $1 dollar USD.
You can use that $1 USD to buy bitcoin which could go up to $2 USD tomorrow.
So why would you spend that USD?
Why would you ever spend USD because you can always earn more by investing it (be it in real estate, stocks, or bitcoin)?
Therefore, I conclude USD is no longer a viable currency. Oh wait...

Coinbase is an regulated American company. Their employees shouldn’t even be allowed to buy, sell, or trade cryptos tbh. Potential conflicts of interest.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:31:49
Work with banks and credit cards to ban transactions to and from crypto currency exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:27:36
Once LN comes around in 2018 (currently available on the test net) all these issues will be solved. 
Check mate atheist!

This right here. Easy to make predictions like this. Much harder to back it up with your money (or balls).

US Government makes it illegal to move money to and from BTC exchanges. Works with banks, credit cards, etc. to enforce the ban. 
Very similar to how online poker is banned in the US. This makes it very inconvenient and would pretty much kill the market.
This is a very realistic scenario and IMO the biggest risk to cryptos. All they'd need to do is say cryptocurrencies are linked to crime/conspiracy/drugs/black market/money laundering.

@_date: 2017-11-16 13:00:04
Not that unlikely. Biggest risk is government intervention.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:43:46
Why not? If you were confident in what you say, then you can print money. Makes me think you aren't confident at all...
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:00:48
I don't disagree with your speculation, I'm just pointing out that it is hard to believe that the US Government banning the trading of cryptocurrencies wouldn't have profoundly negative effects on the price of bitcoin.

ban exchanges.
prevent all financial institutions from being able to send and receive money to exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:19:29
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:06:53
they absolutely can. all they have to do is ban exchanges, and make it very hard to get money in and out of them via financial institutions.
game. set. match.
that would implode bitcoin volume.

online poker in the US had its head completely taken off by the financial institution ban. it’s a perfect example.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:19:20
it plateaued immediately after those regulations and its popularity has fallen off steadily since.
exactly what  happen to bitcoin in that scenario. look, i’m bullish on bitcoin but let’s not pretend government intervention isn’t a huge huge huge risk.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:00:59
just for posting that, i’m going to buy one too
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:01:33
All the way down?

Those aren’t really problems or concerns of the mainstream. So you’re trying to apply a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.
