It's not an old project, it is an ongoing project and as with all worthy projects, there is never a "completion" as evolution is constant.
Problems with specific functions can of course be addressed in future updates.
Rather than focusing on what is "missing", the focus really should be on what's there, the problems BitHalo/BlackHalo it solves right now.
No-one knows the future or which catalyst will springboard crypto to the next level but it very well could be something groundbreaking, original and innovative like BitHalo.

I wholeheartedly agree. The mention by Citi a few days ago was amazing and the Wall Street Journal article plugging BlackCoin as a viable alternative to bitcoin hit the right crowds hard just yesterday. BlackCoin is on the verge of phenomenal financial success, I can just feel it!

BlackCoin is the only alt worth holding long term. The list of developments is long and growing seemingly daily. Digital currencies are here to stay (note the plural) and anyone looking for a great entry point into digital currency investments that feels they missed the bitcoin boat will find all they need at a value price in BlackCoin.

This isn't from the same source that claimed Josh Garza bought hashie.co and scammed 40,000 users of their funds? Or the same source that claimed he was responsible for the current BTC crash? If so, ignore it.
