Bitcoin is only a scam when you don’t own any.

Lmao. Very good job

Who cares about the price of bitcoin today, tomorrow, the next week or the next month ? 
I personally could not care less, all I care is that it will still be around in 10, 20 or 50 years from now. Because if it’s still around in 20 years it sure won’t be worth 10, 20k or even 100k, lol
This shit will become so scarce and expensive than people that sold at 50k USD will all commit suicide

It’s his 5G connection that prevent him from thinking about taking his coins out of exchanges

Maybe not 5000$ but 100$ for a loaf of bread could be possible. But I doubt you will be able to buy a Lambo with your 1btc if that happened. 
And the world will be so fucked up when we get there that I would rather walk around with old clothes and pretend I’m poor so I don’t get robbed

It obviously depends where you live, I try not to spend too much. Because I’m 99.9% sure bitcoin will be higher in 2 years.

I just checked. The same amount of BTC sold on coinbase pro (approx 0.12btc) cost 0.97usd in fees...

It’s maybe vanbex with all the money they stole on their Etherparty ICO..

1 keep enough cash to live for 2 years and the rest is in BTC

Maybe price dump coming ? ��

I would not bother trying to convince him Bitcoin has value. I have tried too hard to explain people what Bitcoin is and they just don't get it.
One day, (if he lives long enough) he will remember about that "dumb guy" buying Bitcoin at the ATM and he will wish he listened to you.

Post this on r/BTC and get ready to lose a lot of Karma points.

He put everything on sale for 10 BTC.
