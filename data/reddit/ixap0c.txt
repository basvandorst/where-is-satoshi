Example: You bought bitcoins on Coinbase, GDAX, or any other exchange and you have not withdrawn them from the exchange. In that case you do not have full control over your bitcoins. If the exchange gets hacked or as it happened with some smaller exchanges where the owner claims the exchange got hacked: Your bitcoins are gone for good. The same applies for online wallets: Instawallet and Inputs.io got hacked and a lot of coins got stolen.
Solution: Withdraw your coins from exchanges and only keep coins there that you want to sell in the immediate future. Don’t use online wallets for more than pocket change (below ~$100). Same applies to wallets on smartphones. Also be sure to enable the password function to encrypt your wallet and use a strong password that you will NOT forget! You can write down hints in safe places if you think you might forget your wallet password. Let me repeat: make sure you don’t lose the password. Just recently someone lost 90% of his bitcoins because he generated a very strong password and by technical/user error the password was not saved in the password management application. The bitcoins were lost forever! Test that everything works before setting a password. Save the password first and make sure it is there. If you use a password management application you need to do backups of these files too of course.
You can use a Desktop wallet like Electrum, saving the wallet to a USB flash drive and plugging it in to use... You can make a Paper wallet for long term storage, there are a lot of options for Bitcoin wallets. Do your research, especially if handling large amounts of currency.

Look at it like an alternative currency, not an investment.
If you have spare money (good job / extra liquid income) then put in a bit here &amp; there, whatever you can afford to lose - don't put all your money into BTC.
Just keep reading / researching, it might take a few days of articles / videos / books.

I don't think so, as long as your temps are fine - good airflow (case, fans, outside air temps, etc.) - see [this post](
Certain algorithms only use a portion of the TDP of your hardware, the CryptoNight algorithm for Monero / Bytecoin only uses around 50% of the power (watts).
You can google hardware benchmarks, and there are sites like  on various reported hashrates - both from single GPU + multi-GPU setups.

Since you're in IT, check out mining alt coins.
You can mine some coins with a CPU, but you're better off with GPU using the CPU as a little bonus.
Check out etc. You could convert altcoins you mine into Bitcoin through an exchange. You won't make too much money with a single GPU / CPU setup, an extra $30-40 a month.
For obtaining Bitcoin directly you are better off buying through some type of exchange like Coinbase / GDAX to get your feet wet.

Just know one thing - things are always easier in hindsight.
What I mean by this is you don't know what will happen in 24h, 1 week, etc... Once you know the past, it's easier to look back and wish you did things differently - but 1 year ago there was no telling how things would be today.

You can purchase coins through Coinbase, then when the transaction is complete, transfer them to your personal wallet - be it Desktop, Mobile, Hardware, Paper, etc.
I bought my first fraction of a bitcoin through coinbase, it was pretty easy once the verification was complete. It took around 2 days for the small transactions to go through my bank account to verify through Coinbase - at first I wasn't sure if I gave the right information, but after it went through I was verified &amp; up and running.
There is a 5-7 day wait on your BTC purchase through Bank Transfer, it takes some time - buying with a MasterCard / Visa is instant, but the fees are a bit higher. If you are just buying BTC to hold onto for long term, bank is the better option IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:30:08


Yes. You get the amount of Bitcoin it says you are receiving in X amount of days. Whatever amount/fraction you buy will increase/decrease dependent on the current price of BTC. 
If you bought 0.1 BTC about a week ago at 10k for about $1000, it'd be $1536.18 now.

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:41:26
You exchange $1000 into BTC at whatever the current prices are.
You receive that fraction of BTC at the exchange price you paid, although there is a wait period of around a week for the banks to wire transfer (Credit Card is instant).
Even if the wait period is 1 week and the price of BTC doubles, if you pay for X amount of bitcoin at current exchange rate, you receive that amount - not the price in 7 days when you receive it.

You could get new [equipment]( using mining profit to upgrade your operation / profit.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:27:24
Well an S9 will pay for itself in 60 days, Bitcoin would have to double in that time-frame for you to make the money back.
I'm just getting into altcoin mining myself, looking to make a little money on the side with my gaming ring mining Monero...
Good luck on your mining venture, I would upgrade mining equipment if I were you, but that's just me. I'd be running 4 or more if I could afford them &amp; rent a space to leave them whirling. 
You could get an R4 instead of an S9, a little cheaper and they can run at home.

You need to upload a photo ID so yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:53:51
Yeah at least on Coinbase, and probably GDAX since they are the same company.
You don't get the Bitcoin right away for spending. You have to wait for the bank transfers to complete, which can take 5-7 business days.
But yes, you get the BTC at current price. You own that amount of BTC, it is coming to you once the transfers clear. Once you receive the BTC through Coinbase it will show in your Balance and you can send it to other wallets (your offline wallet, merchants, etc.) - do not use Coinbase wallet for long term storage for significant amounts, transfer to your personal wallet.

I am just mining Bytecoin for shits and giggles, I am on a really old 2011 gaming laptop with a first gen i7 720QM, only doing around 33 H/s...
It's not worth anything but I am gaining some mining experience, seeing what it's like. [Reading this]( now, soon I will be building a gaming computer, to mine Monero on the side when not in use.
I tried mining Monero on my laptop but the hash rate was too low, the mining pools have 'payout threshold' - you have to hit a certain balance mined in order to withdraw... My rig would've several months - a year to hit one of those, but I can hit the 50 BCN threshold in a few days. It's not worth shit, but experience is experience... When I build a mid-range gaming PC, I'll be mining around 0.3 XMR per month with an RX 570.

Yo man, I really need 500 reddit karma... 
I'm going to write about Bitcoin in 10 year old handwriting, because I need that shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:02:16
You can look into mining alt-coins, like Ethereum or Litecoin. Currently, Bitcoin mining requires an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) miner which are quite expensive &amp; cost a lot of electricity to run - so high upfront cost to start mining Bitcoin right now.
I wish I started mining back in 2011 when my laptop could probably do it... If only I did that and started hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:10:23
You don't have to buy a whole coin - you can buy a small fraction; 0.001 for around $10, 0.01 for around $100, 0.1 for $998, etc.

Coinbase seemed like a nice introduction for a first-time buyer and someone new to BTC.
Any advantages to GDAX over Coinbase? I heard someone saying lower fees, which would be nice.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:13:31
Do you have a savings account? You can link your savings account to Coinbase &amp; purchase BTC through wire transfer. It takes several business days for the 'verification deposit' to appear.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:32:10
I just did exactly [that]( it took 2 days to get setup with the exchange but now I can buy BTC with my Savings account. The transfer takes 7 days which is a bit of a wait, but I just want to invest $10-20 here &amp; there and see where it goes from there, also using it for online transactions.
