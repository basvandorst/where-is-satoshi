Many people think that the Bitcoin Core development team, who basically control the development of the BTC protocol, are against common sense scaling solutions for Bitcoin because of a potential conflict of interest. Many Bitcoin Core developers are employees or directors at a company called Blockstream, who could potentially benefit from the scaling solutions that are being proposed by Bitcoin Core.
These common sense scaling solutions most notably is increasing the blocksize from 1mb to 2mb or more as is needed to reduce network consumption. Fees and transaction confirmation times have never been longer so increasing the (arbitrary) 1mb block size to allow more transactions per block only makes sense. 
The Bitcoin Core argument that increasing block size leads to centralization ignores the reality that hard drive storage space is extremely cheap.
Bitcoin Core members are also involved in blatant censorship of this very subreddit, as well as other influential Bitcoin discussion forums. 
Since the original purpose of Bitcoin is to be a P2P digital cash system, many people feel that Bitcoin Core has failed to respond to the needs of the community by implementing common sense solutions to scale Bitcoin and keep transaction fees low enough that it can be used in this manner. Bitcoin has been coopted away from the 'digital currency' space and many people feel that the lack of actual real world use due to high fees and wait times will make people stop using the currency and it will ultimately be devalued.
There are other competing iterations of Bitcoin that I highly recommend you look into. I personally believe that only the protocols with the best innovative properties will ultimately be successful, and I and many others think that BTC is doing itself an extreme disservice by having such a poor scaling plan.
That's the gist anyway. I highly recommend you, and anyone new to Bitcoin, do their research.

Gold has the benefit of being analog (so potentially useful in an apocalyptic scenario) as well as being useful in many other applications like circuits and industrial uses as an actual metal. It's also rare which makes it valuable for these purposes. It's also beautiful and used in jewelry and things. It's also engrained in almost every culture on earth.
All bitcoin has going for it is first mover advantage and use as the worlds P2P digital cash. Now it doesn't have that. What does it have?

Ha ha. I hear you. You're right, Bitcoin does have the properties that make it interchangeable and fungible. It was a great innovation. You just also have to make it usable, thus creating demand. You also have to make it unique enough from any competitors who might be doing something that provides a better user experience. This is why Bitcoin is going to fail. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:54:56
A 'store of value' as it's sole use case is honestly the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life. Sure, a commodity with a fixed supply will always go up in value as long as there sufficient/constant demand. However, if the demand drops to 0, the price will fall to 0 and it will be worthless. If the only source for demand of Bitcoin is the fact that it goes up in price, what happens when it doesn't go up in price? What happens if it goes down? It won't have any more use and will become worthless. The only reason Bitcoin was even worth anything in the first place because it was a medium of exchange and a global decentralized digital cash. That is actually super cool and useful! I love that. However, Bitcoin Core and co don't love that. Now Bitcoin Cash is attempting to actually fulfill that use case as a global P2P currency. I wonder if Bitcoin Core fumbled the ball so bad that it will prevent BCH from taking over even though y'all started with 100% market share and 1st mover advantage. It's pretty amazing that the core developers screwed up so badly. Now, it will probably be ETH or some other coin that has better fundamentals that allow real use cases that will drive real demand in the real world. Store of Value? Ha!

I could make the same point to the people actually ‘working’ on the protocol.

Yes, you rode the wave of speculation based on Bitcoin's utility as a P2P global digital cash system much like Myspace shareholders rode the wave of potentially being the worlds social network and then cashed out and bought cars and apartments before it plummeted in value because no one used it.

It's not just the beauty of it. It's that, combined with the fact that it is valuable. Women don't want to wear fake gold. They like the fact it's a valuable resource. That history is hard to shake, it goes back thousands of years. Gold is also uniquely rare due to its elemental properties, impossible to have a similar imitation. Bitcoin however, can be forked and have a similar implementation that is actually better. 
Bitcoin is rare due to a limited supply. But it only retains value if it is actually used for something. If there is no demand, it doesn't matter how limited the supply is, it will be worthless. There's a limited supply of my childhood toys but their only value is in what they can be used for by someone else. 
I think you're joking with the apocalyptic comment, I wish you all the best pal. But yeah, obviously gold is better than bottle caps :)

@_date: 2017-12-22 06:09:37
Partly for the lolz. But mostly, because I feel it is important to publicize the fact that cryptocurrencies and anything really, get their value from being used. I believe the reason Bitcoin was valuable in the first place, was the speculation on it because it was poised to be the worlds global decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin isn't that anymore, it is a 'store of value'. However, I want to suggest that a store of value is useless without any other use case. Bitcoin was valuable because people needed it for transactions. Now, you can no longer use it for transactions because of the high fees and confirmation times, thus it is useless. 
I make this specific analogy because Myspace lost marketshare to Facebook and while they employ similar technologies, Facebook is valuable because it has a lot of 'users' because people like Facebook. Without users it is worthless. Without users, Bitcoin is worthless. You need use to be valuable!

Are you familiar with Ethereum at all and their scaling road map? They've barely even begun. They have an actual plan including Proof of Stake and sharding. They also have 2nd layer solutions deployed on the main net. They have a wealth of people working on these, under direction of Vitalik, someone I trust a whole lot more to achieve these goals than Adam Back and Luke Jr. 
What's Bitcoin's scaling plan? Lightning? A few kb saved in the block b/c of SegWit? I'm not seeing how that's better than any other coin.

Yes because it’s retarded to want to make the network usable by keeping transaction fees low. /s

I never disputed that. Whether the studies are that there are less women interested than men or most are uninterested (as with the general pop), that seems reasonable. 


This is where we disagree. Historical discrimination most likely led to less women being involved in STEM and tech than otherwise would be, 100%. 


I agree that things like affirmative action are problematic and cause many problems and that we should always strive for a meritocracy. However, they exist because of historical injustices they attempt to rewrite, which are very real. 
If you've beaten down a population, killed any educated ones, treated as 2nd class citizens, terrorized along racial lines, left in economically depressed neighbourhoods, it only makes sense to attempt to lift people out of that state and try and help them get on their feet with just a slight amount of assistance. The implementation is tricky but most agree something should be done. 
Economics shows us ways to distribute scarce resources, and so a dollar given to one area must be taken from another. If white people in the US have been so historically advantaged, it might make sense to redirect some resources to help those who have been disadvantaged, if only as a temporary measure. I'm not talking full on communist dictatorship, I'm talking like, more investment in education and neighbourhood programs. If Google wants to participate in such a scheme whereby they hire more minorities for whatever reason, it seems that along these restitutive lines that it would be acceptable. People are independent agents that are allowed to decide not to work for a company with certain policies they don't like. 


But I would never force women to study STEM, just because there is too few women. That's a poor reason. 
No one said anything about forcing women to study STEM. That sounds crazy. All I'm saying is that less women being in STEM could 'stem' from past social injustices and that perhaps the # of women in STEM isn't accurately reflected by the 'natural inclination' % level of society. Google may feel that having more women and minorities with access to this world may spur more positive social change which is their company's goal (perhaps) and preogative. 
Forcing people to do anything is stupid, as is thinking women aren't suited for a job in tech. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:32:12
Most of your points have to do with performance and skill, which could very well be true in regards to actual current numbers and rankings of the most skilled men and women in the field, guys are likely to populate the majority of that list. 
It's worth noting though that the fact that list would be more populated with men is simply a descriptive measure, in which there are many cases of sexism against women in the industry and many other social factors that go into women being less involved and prevalent in the STEM fields. 
So, while sure it might not have any affect on profit, I think there are other intangible benefits to having such a policy for the company that are harder to value, like increased likability for the brand to be supportive of historically disadvantaged groups (women, minorities, etc.). 
Hell, maybe Sergei Bryn and Larry Page's sole motivation is to put historically disadvantaged or marginalized groups in employment positions to better those communities and provide more access to the tech world for these people. Would that not be Google's prerogative as an private employer? Especially when it is in line with generally agreed upon idea that something should be done to help these people on a legal level (affirmative action measures etc). 
So, I would say that perhaps there are a multitude of reasons to hire more women that cannot be easily and directly linked to profits. If behavioural economics has taught us anything it's that people can behave irrationally for many different reasons. If people find Google's methods to be offputting they can work elsewhere or use Bing. As long as they aren't breaking any discrimination laws they can do whatever they like as far as I'm concerned.

Dude, after reading your post I think you should DEFINITELY move.
Granted, there are about 1000 odds and ends that I'm not privy to that make moving a very cumbersome and difficult task, easier said than done, I know. 
However, from the sounds of it, you are way overqualified for your job, it doesn't interest you, and it sounds like there isn't a lot of upward mobility anyway. 
Think about your life when you're old, do you think you'd be happier with your decision to stick to living where you are, do the same boring thing everyday, not have any professional satisfaction, be susceptible to small town small company politics. (Piss off the guy's cousin and you never get promoted kinda thing). 
There's a whole world out there, especially in the cities. I'm not a CS professional so I can't give you a lot of advice there, but from what I can tell the job market where I live (Vancouver, Canada) is very favourable to anyone with development expertise. The last company I worked for hired a guy with 0 formal education and pretty much just did a technical test and was hired for UX. 
I would recommend you save up money, make a plan of attack, secure an average/mediocre job, and just 'network' aka talk to different people who might know of something or someone who could help you out. 
I am almost certain, that 1 year out, your career prospects will be vastly more suitable and exciting for you if you chose to move to a tech hub of some sort. 
You'd be surprised how quickly your life can change if you put yourself in the right situations. I like the quote "life doesn't happen in your living room" and I feel like working a tech job in a rural area is a figurative 'living room' and 'outside' is a place with much higher traffic like a city. Not hating on rural living at all, there's a great appeal, but cities are certainly advantageous for many reasons, being fun and exciting being one, and the opportunity to meet so many people outside of your small circle that can help lead you to new opportunities. 
Anyway, I say this a single guy that has moved around a few times, so I get that it's not that easy, especially with a kid and financial security being paramount. Still, if I were you, I would try to find a way to move to a city and have faith in your personality and skills that you can meet people who might be able to point you in a more favourable direction. 
Best of luck bud!

That's preposterous. I'm not going to go all freak out SJW on you, but that's somewhat of a dangerous line of thinking. 
I think you have to be careful not to dissuade women from pursuing their goals by reinforcing the idea that they won't be good at it. If that is the common narrative, then they will internalize that they aren't good at this and potentially reinforce the idea and prevent women who would be very capable or talented in CS from pursuing a degree. 
Sure, preference plays a role, natural ability could certainly be affected by biological factors, but to say "women aren't good at X" is kind of bullshit, if only if it dissuades the few or many who would like to pursue this topic but fear a stigma perpetuated by people like yourself, or worse yet that they believe it themselves. 
Variation within each sex is far too large to make broad statements like that. Sure, it's reasonable to not try and make everything 50/50 if that is not where the natural inclinations lie, but I still think it's not a good idea to make such generalizations about such a large population, particularly one that has been pushed down and aside for their entire history, who knows what women are capable of a few decades removed from that kind of social reinforcement. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:14:27
