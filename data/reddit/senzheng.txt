very specifically, the peg is not trustless in federated, the side chain is as any other chain. but yes, creator of drivechain tech doesn't consider federated bridged chains as sidechains.
personally, drivechain or sidechain tech &gt;&gt;&gt; rsk in importance. simpler sidechain might be better like ltc based, but for now rsk will have to do until we have the tools to add w/e. it's a tool to enable options that in no way affect main-chain security or backwards compatibility.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:56:27
the chain is decentralized as any chain, depends on participation.
issue is specifically with pegging the value via a bridge where you can trade BTC for smartBTC and vise versa. they want to do it ideally with drivechains, which require soft fork. 
fed peg is their temporary solution - and members are decided by a centralized party.
20% fee kept by single company is also a big no-no for me - imo should at least have a time decay to 0 or they should charge some fee on swapping between chains as drivechain alone is not enough for speed swaps.
Regardless of what RSK wants to do, [drivechain]( soft fork itself would allow experimentation of all kinds to happen that can be rsk without the fees &amp; so on. The excuses Core is giving for those delays are something I am unable to side with them on as it's not consistent to design risks in forks they pass themselves.
These optional tools to create sidechains via drivechains are just as important as LN as LN is not a universal solution.

I don't know if you consider loading VISA with it once a month as "using it" but that's how I and my friends been doing it for a while. We use a fast but unsecure cash layer and store it in secure blockchain layer. Occasionally, I'll find myself short and top it out on my phone in seconds. I've made a few larger purchases with it directly as well, but that's just mostly for fun.
Hal Finney, even in 2010, knew this would likely be the case: 
If we can get the world to accept some faster layer that doesn't exist yet to support global finance is unknown. Not even the blockchains being designed for millions tx/sec are claiming to handle all global finance directly and are building for off-chain scaling as well be it various sidechains or layers.
Blockchains are not necessary for everything nor is decentralization, It's just a choice that I'm glad exists and others might be too.

"As a result, every time a person or a corporation runs a smart contract on RSK, 80% of the fuel paid goes to the miners and the remaining 20% to RSK Labs, so we can continue the development of the open source platform."
Yes, absurd. Less absurd than premining 70% of coins like ETH did becoming so centralized, but why do this.
Technically if drivechains are out, nothing stops someone from creating rsk without the 20% of contract fees.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:13:03
yes, but it's optional, nobody is forced to use it or its contracts. 
tbh it's quite viable to make a mistake and make bitcoins unaccessible too with native contracts, but probably less likely with smaller attack surface as it's well defined without complex state or permissions.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:11:00
some projects in crypto are built specifically for order matching for atomic swaps (blocknet and barterdex for example that use a middle chain to handle that aspect) - probably doesn't matter how many new or others appear to match since it's decided by individuals on what tools to use to find someone to switch with, possibly for small margin of profit.

Best I could find: 
They are not happy about some of its space usage (ok, reasonable) and some of its security properties (it's not meant to be as secure as main chain). A lot of proposals about sidechains were done and we need 1 implemented even if not ideal as long as it's optional. In one place peter todd refers to it reducing security of main chain through merge mining which I couldn't find source for. 
I wonder if there's a good write up on spv chains and drivechain compare/contrast and which one is safer to implement to provide options bc that's all we ask.
atomic swaps shouldn't be dangerous since they are designed to be  "atomic" meaning either entire trade happens or no trade happens, even if someone aborts - can't cheat.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:10:01

No, you're wrong about the most developed and the most secure cryptocurrency as a fact.
Just because they didn't panic and rush to lower security parameters &amp; risk tx losses from spv chaos to scale 2-4x times because you wanted them to and are going with safer approach to scale millions of times.
The rule is: if you don't know something, don't open your mouth until you actually read a thing or two.

larger block sidechain with LN using either chain would be the best approach - everyone who doesn't want it would be happy, everyone who wants it will be happy - it's a no nonsense approach. however, I am starting to get really disappointed to relative lack of development on sidechain tech - sidechains allow so much improvement and experimentation without endangering main chain.

you call it an upgrade, but it's not necessarily better.
it's a measurably less secure choice just by increasing bandwidth that a security parameter was limiting. many, e.g. for whom the fees are meaningless, might not want to drop their security because people want to pay less. sidechain and LN do that without forcing everyone but providing options like saving/checking accounts where you accept some risk to try faster tech optionally.
Segwit is a [2 mb+ increase]( that is a compromise that is taking coinbase/bitpay forever to implement. It's a complex problem - I don't have much against higher throughput coins as long as users have a choice and are aware of trade-offs they accept to use it.
* 
* 
* 
I wouldn't mind 8 mb blocksize sidechain or literally any setting you want sidechain being created, and right now I'm a little annoyed at core's reluctance to focus on sidechains, despite optional security downgrade - similar to deciding to use a segwit address - optional &amp; backwards compatible shouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:02:09
with lowest value tx being forced to use altcoins anyway and accept higher risks for experimental other designs, it's crazy to me they are waiting on implementing or at least working on already prepared drivechain soft fork.
rsk isn't the only usecase for drivechains and it's core's job to provide these optional tools as level 1 developers. seems so reversed.
The arguments about backwards incompatibility or higher network load don't apply and risks are similar to those of LN/segwit meaning this should be a hugely important topic, not take backseat like it is now. I often defend some core design choices as they are not obvious, but this one is a mystery to me.
I don't have a favorite team, and just side with what seems logical per case, and it would be unacceptable to me to block **optional** choices these tools would provide.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:19:43
security through decentralization is what drew people to bitcoin. for small tx you can pay really tiny fees on paypal today if that's what you want. size limits and sorting by fees are only a method of protecting decentralization against sybil attacks. there are other models, but we know this one works for sure. thankfully we have smart contracts on btc enabling us to create state channels and transact through higher levels with near no fees. There may be very little reason to use layer 1 for tx for most people in future with enough state channels. Levels of abstraction can build higher too, like layer 3.

There was only 1 bailout fork despite many losses since then.
It's not a secret Ethereum Foundation was invested in DAO that happens to be the only bailout. **It was spammed on every sub**, that's why there's so many sources available describing ethereum's centralization. Even eth subreddits were [strongly against it]( before the ethical people left.
Check sources yourself:




What about people who wanted to buy censorship resistant smart contracts platform and had to deal with massive  price decline after successful bailout of ethereum foundation with only ~4% support proved ethereum's perfect centralization?  They would've had to sell at lower value since one chain was unfunded and abandoned and other one was centralized. That makes your statement wrong and only a guess.


Yeah, what is the point of this technology when it is advertised as one thing but works and is treated like another thing. In the legal system, they call it fraud and manipulation of a security. 


Only people that advertised that were slock.it and ethereum foundation to raise money in crowd sales, nobody has done that so explicitly before them. Then they changed the rules on everyone when they lost money.


There are no platforms that are "completed". And this clause was never mentioned when raising money where it's they claim centralized control in ethereum is acceptable until someone someday says it's done.
@_date: 2019-02-22 17:28:43
those are temporary issues imo
- there's a hard limit on channel sizes so as you get closer to that it's low chance to find channels
- we don't yet have the latest spec where payments go through parallel channels so you can use many smaller channels for big transactions
- it also matters on quality of nodes you connect to and we're still learning what best ways are to know what connections are best
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:29:50
accumulated work might be an ok metric bc its expensive to mine unpopular one for long, but they can mine at a loss for pretty long time if they really wanted to, length of time here is kinda important, which they don't mention.
so their statement isn't very conclusive
last thing we need is 4 mining pools deciding new bitcoin rules, but that's where markets and [nodes]( come in for balance.
sidenote:  seems to be the most common reason I see this subreddit now
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:07:05
hard limit is due to developers of all implementations being uneasy of much money locked up this early, which is what makes those issues a bit unfair since it was designed to hit those limits as it is right now
splitting payments between multiple routes would actually simplify both the UX/users and network's throughput capacity and thus path finding enormously as well
all that would reduce dependence on where in the network you're connected to and again simplify things for user
there's also spynx that would allow sending to anyone without invoice
channel factories (&amp; similar) allow creation of new virtual channels w/o confirming on the blockchain first
all that is allowing it to approach the UX of using a regular blockchain without having to make everything a matter of permanent record and thus speeds up and unlocks mobility
it's an optional layer nobody has to use too, so building vertical complexity doesn't hurt those who don't want, which is nice.
there is also option for a bunch of people to agree and connect to same hub and then everyone's just 2 hops away, which is approximately a faster plasma sidechain - hub can annoy but can't steal funds. bonus is they can still be connected to rest of lightning network.

Believe it or not we might have similar goals - we want something that improves human lives and makes world a better place.
One can focus on some wronged minor parties and overlook security flaws, while one could accept some people not getting what they want and focus on well being of people relying on its security in future. 
I think ethereum is quite possibly one of the most harmful projects to the human race and the damage would be most evident if they do trick enough people to rely on it before it fails once again as it has always done, every time causing more and more damage to more and more people. In addition, any funding it diverts from other legitimate projects that would've helped people and kept them safe is just additional opportunity cost lost.
I can see nothing worse than cryptocurrencies being replaced by fake centralized networks like ethereum that just change who runs the world, not improve it, and put more people at risk.

I typically don't comment in this subreddit because of how it's moderated, but I'll answer.
Nakamoto didn't have a good solution for preventing spam attacks. He suggested phasing in changes years ahead of when they would be necessary so there was no chance of contention, to give everyone time to review and opt-in.  (suggestion of increases after specific block height)
He also didn't have a solution to updating block size cap and in fact warned about such updates that would result in fork. (his comment to garzik)
He did envision data centers possibly being ok, but this was before he observed high centralization from mining, like right now, that would already be vulnerable to attacks if it wasn't for full nodes.
Satoshi also invented state channels, so clearly he was thinking about off chain scaling too
Miners do not control bitcoin (entirely):  (e.g. UASF forcing Segwit to activate on 3 coins in few months)
51% is not enough 
pool distribution suggests we already would be vulnerable if not for full nodes: 
Full nodes:  (note how many are running older clients)
Max block size has been increased in backwards compatible soft fork method (1 of 3 parts of segwit):


Why not backwards incompatible block size increase (hard fork)?
All older nodes would split from new nodes. SPV/light/thin clients would have no idea what chain is real. People might not know which chain the other person/business is on. Hard fork for blockchain fixes is something everyone has no choice about (e.g. someone printing infinite coins), but block size increase is a speed upgrade and security downgrade, and minor one at both. Little reason for everyone to rush, making it more likely to result in people's money losses from chain splits. This temporary chaos and losses and lack of incentive is one of reasons.
In effect it would also pressure everyone to switch to new chain or lose access to future updates from the team of that specific codebase. Not that big of a deal in Bitcoin since lack of premine and ICO make it a more even playing field that's typical today, but still hard to replace hundreds of volunteer core developers vs typical small teams on others. 
 
Additionally there are long term security effects:
* 
* 
* 
* 
Segwit allows each user to select if they want to use new design or old by moving coins between old and classic addresses. Many soft forked upgrades bitcoin has every year are mostly opt-in for those that want them (e.g. RBF), very different from forcing something you might consider less secure onto everyone.
HF block size increases and reduced security forces changes on all users. In soft fork, people can educate themselves and opt-in. Nobody has innovated more in soft forks than Bitcoin. There's a reason why nothing else comes close to [development]( efforts, and that's just core layer, still many different layer 2 projects and sidechain projects. 
These aren't theoretical. at least 5 significant teams working on various implementations and combined ones together already in feature freezes and functioning public software on public testnets for quality review and adjustments. (e.g. [this]( or [this](
Sidechain with two way 1:1 peg actually enable holder of every coin to migrate to chain they want with properties they want, leaving choice to users again. Main net of rsk launching in a month, although with federated 1:1 bridge with drivechains planned.
There's more random projects like [elements]( but too many to list.
This takes time to write out so I hesitate normally. Hope it helps.
2 weeks is to deal with different vulerabilities from rapidly changing difficulty up and down: 
block/min increase increases orphaning rate and leads to splits and bandwidth as before. mostly affects latency.

didn't mean to imply that, something lost in translation. I'm saying the centralized push of bailout was posted on all subreddits and was the biggest and most obvious news in crypto at that time - focus is not on spam but how well understood that centralization was. to this day, all jokes about centralization reference ethereum as best example among the OG's.
Don't forget how the not only the platform advertised it clearly (not sure where they said it won't be done and thus not decentralized until serenity) but also the DAO:


[source]( and also mentioned [here]( 


I just don't consider him an exploiter and think he deserved those coins more than anyone else who invested in DAO. I see only issues with EF being able to label someone "an exploiter" or "attacker" to do w/e they want.
I have ETH myself and had it since ICO. I don't even mind intervening - if governance was formalized and was consensus, I wouldn't care. But there's no evidence at all bailout would've been able to reach consensus or happen if it was done fairly. Bad coin distribution thanks to premine/ICO is possibly one of the reasons they can't just formalize the governance as it would only centralize control further but otherwise it should be handled on [formalized governance layer]( instead of reddit.

ETH is for faster but unsecure payments. There is [zero doubt ethereum is centralized]( and thus unsecure, but plenty more security failures as well.
I'll paste response that was removed by some eth moderator that summarizes that there are no circumstances when ethereum has any use or better than alternatives, not even bitcoin:


**False** Smart contracts around for ages:
Bitcoin (And many others) had custom smart contracts (in addition to protocol itself) since 2009. 
Script let you combine anything like multisignature accounts, payment channels, escrows, time locks, atomic cross-chain trading, oracles, or multi-party lottery with no operator as some examples
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
And stuff like dex's and tokens and ICO's using xcp. Plus there's MAST and RSK (dec 4) coming up. So basically everything ethereum has ever advertised.
Plus of course ethereum is centralized so exactly 0 security and  order of magnitudes slower and more expensive to use than alternatives.
There's a reason why [inventor of smart contracts hates ethereum]( - he respects security, something ethereum has none of.


You mean [backdoor]( that no legitimate developer would ever suggest for public cryptocurrency.


They are not. Cryptographers came up with zk-snarks and zk-starks, they are just adopting them,and there's 0 guarantee they will be adopted because of how intense the calculation is.
There are zero innovations in ethereum, every scaling plan is using research others have done and being promoted as their own. plasma - childchains, tree chains, raiden - lightning 5+ teams on BTC, sharding - again [old technique]( there are no projects on ethereum that aren't years behind others. Look at dex's on eth - they are all worse than what we had in 2013-2014.


As one of many similar tools, free of centralized control of ethereum public chain and community of only liars and thieves with 0 talent


evm and eth smart contract are actually some of the worst ever (even eth founders can't write them properly)
* 
* 
* 
Plus many other security failures
* [100% centralization thanks to massive premine and ICO bad distribution, forced bailout without consensus](
* went against Satoshi's design advice and have multiple implementations with badly designed EVM [leading to block chain splits and lost or reversed transactions](
* Rushed [code]( [over]( and [over]( again leading to global failures
* [these aren't "writer's programming fault"](
* [0 governance](

You won't read it because you clearly don't like to read things that don't fit a narrative  you made up, but this eth dev explains it nice [here]( and [here](


Bitcoin didn't have a choice but to rewind chain, universal consensus. This is called consensus.
Ethereum Foundation decided for majority instead of letting them decide and moved money without warning or consensus to others including themselves. This is called centralization.
I was in eth probably before you and don't identify as bitcoiner, virtually all altcoin communities despise ethereum for an entire year due to this incident. Only current different eth community thinks they are in the right, because anyone ethical or who cares about decentralization wouldn't be in it anymore.


The hack is irrelevant to me, only you bring up a random DAO user. 
I am only talking about the response which showed lack of ethics and centralization. You are defending thieves, liars, criminals, fraudsters, and some of the worst people who exist today - Ethereum Foundation and current ethereum community.
Only you are defending theives who STOLE millions of dollars both with the centralized fork and with WHG hack and then market attacks and lies. Which is why ethereum is best known as the chain of [liars and thieves](


This just makes you look worse as you're supporting unethical morally corrupt people for an entire year or chose to not read about it (not reading is common in typical eth community). Also no statute of limitations on securities fraud so ideally they will all see prison for the rest of their life.


Exactly. 
I love how you're wrong about every aspect of it, but refuse to learn anything. Science, facts, and reasoning are pretty much biggest enemies of ethereum and onecoin type communities.
I wonder how you rationalize yourself or ever think you're a good person in any manner. Literally no one in eth community has the right to call themselves ethical or honest people.

you can get banned in almost every subreddit
reddit is shit place for discussion whenever there are moderators
you're always wondering what opinions you're not seeing here

it's very hard to scale on chain. some trade off security for more capacity. bitcoin is trying something else. hard to say what's better. 
also there is more capacity than many think via batching: 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:10:50
hmm if armory maybe armory_walletID_backup.wallet or armory_walletID_backup.wallet or anything with word wallet
if files were windows erased, there are ways to restore if space wasn't overwritten

coinbase is biggest one that hasn't yet and they are heavily pressured, tbh all coins should be batched bc its cheaper for users. companies are being lazy bc blockchain space is typically worth very little elsewhere
the recent blocks above 2 mb were from bitgo batching
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:38:33
smart people should be able to choose on merit between simple and complicated approaches. 
nothing simple about scalability when facing security downsides. 
blockchains are used for security.
bitcoin was created for security.
speed without security is trivial. 
increasing block size when it compromises protocol security and compromises users security due to disagreement splits. 
It's a choice to accept those security downsides.
Additionally, it's a choice to do this temporary change that will have to be done again later on same exact issue. It just postpones facing exact same choices down the line and having to introduce risks again instead of long term solution.
It's not wrong to make that choice, but it's completely understandable to choose not to do it for security.

i guess can also look for words like backup back up back-up
that might have 12 or 15 English words back to back, looks like this: 
I think some form of this was around back then.

by his estimation, absolute highest rate (pretty much impossible) would roughly be 50 tx/sec
it's just cheaper for everyone to use it given a limited resource with fees being priced per kb or w/e used and not per tx.

which one?
fork is exaggerated word to describe someone using anothers distribution
gold - some gpu mining altcoin is using bitcoin coin distribution for snapshot and calling it a fork. also there's some weird private mining happening to raise funds. there's like weeks of difference between snapshot to actual network launch. complete joke.
2x - nya agreement fork attempt that doesn't include support of almost any of 100s of core devs. likely will cause node confusion short term &amp; network issues - and long term security would be lower due to higher bandwidth requirements. there will also be replay attacks possible so best to split coins before using them. it would increase max block weight to 8 mb from current 4 mb. [node counts]( and various polls ([1]( suggest not major chance of success but possible support from bitpay and coinbase and unpredictable miners could tilt the odds. No idea about their [roadmap]( 
This seems ok 
I don't know date for 2x, mid november is current rumor
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:21:43
yup. made me a fan of the show

I only came here bc saw link on twitter, so I'm not real bitcoiner. 
Yeah, I want people to do whatever they want.
All these ICO's are claiming decentralization. That's cool. Lets have legal agencies and whoever else wants to test those claims with bans. Claims cost nothing to make, but no ICO has ever resulted in good project.
They are all highly centralized and lie about it. If they are censorship resistant, they will be fine. Otherwise, ideally capital punishment or years in prison for everyone who has done ICO should clarify to everyone ICO's always result in centralized projects that are trivial to censor.

bc it will cause a split &amp; thus money loss when different people end up on different incompatible chains. 
most do not want to drop security more with higher bandwidth or temporary split. 
also limit is 4 mb already

2x support is small:

I think it's healthy to have people support different view points.
I get why people think this is about block chain size or utxo size but almost always it's about the network.
Most important might be the 3rd explanation he gives here: 
it's also covered in point 5 here: 
personally I think gobal bandwidth access will eventually grow into this size to where reducing bandwidth cap is not necessary
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:06:19
we already had like 2.3 mb blocks, maybe more, haven't kept up. segwit was in part a soft forked size increase &amp; w/ complex tx can go up to 4 mb.
its not a single download/upload too. it's for 8 peers or so per node. and then time wise (which is important for miners) it has to hop node to node to node &amp; so on throughout either FIBRE network that's more centralized or public network that takes way longer. it would be safer if it was possible to not need FIBRE network. every delay in validation or propagation costs miners money on average:  &amp;&amp; 
imo we'll grow into not needing it without decreasing bandwidth so I'm not really into luke's idea
