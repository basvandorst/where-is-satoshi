Great point, if the discount is large enough.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:03:12
Definitely. Looking forward to watching monero closely in the next couple of years!
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:38:10
Is this really true? even POS coins are just tweaked bitcoin clones? so you would be able to find the same lines of code?
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:56:02
I get why, but would love a GUI wallet soon and a MUCH better website :)

hello sir, I would like to hear if there is any way for me to invest in safello shares or something similar at this point? best regards

@_date: 2014-10-29 12:26:30
Litecoin because it is so similar to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:11:38
I completely agree!

That is an interesting point of view, but seeing how much infrastructure has been made I dont think we are talking years. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 21:05:58
Well I think there is great deal of consensus that miners dump some of their bitcoins to make up electricity costs, a few people have unlimited fiat for electricity. Dont you think?
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:25:32
nope it just feels so weird when people make question posts and dont share their own answer. I made this post because I am interested to know how people invested in bitcoin would choose amongst other options.
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:37:12
I dont know abaout Urocoin, but bitshares makes sense to me :) !
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:30:43
loyalty to the bitcoin foundation? to the pseudonym satoshi? to you? to this community?
This is not a thread about loyalty but a genuine interest in where people would go from bitcoin if it collapsed..
And who says I am male?
oh and just FYI I am not down voting you or calling you names, because I feel it would only clutter the debate and make you feel bad or angry..
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:27:45
Wauw there is a lot of venom in this subreddit :o
@_date: 2014-06-21 21:17:23
Just for the record I do spend bitcoins, I am just trying to play the devils advocate..
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:51:54
You've convinced me; just bought bitcoins with my litecoins. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:55:11
Maybe not for you, but for some people there is. Why is it you are so set on Bitcoin? I agree with it being a cool idea, and I love using it, but I dont feel like I in your words have loyalty towards the code or the coin, I always am interested to use the best software and hardware personally. Again I would love to here what makes you so set on Bitcoin? Are you heavily invested or so?
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:20:29
Oh and thanks for your response :)
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:32:55
That is a good point, there are however still fees involved both with getting fiat to an exchange (bank to bank transfer) and in exchanging fiat for bitcoins (host's fee), so in the end wont I end up loosing money?
@_date: 2014-06-21 20:06:14
Thank you ever so much, you have given me a lot to think about :) I really like your thinking and would actually like to know if your yourself can find flaws in your chain of arguments? You've convinced me too much to be critical, but sometimes we ourselves are good at finding flaws in our arguments!
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:46:26
First of all you did not answer my post, but you are probably aware of that so moving on to your next postulate :)
I am not trying to pump Redd it is one of the more stable currencies, and I actually hope it will remain that way, simply because with every pump a dump follows and people loose money. I dont want people to loose money and so I actually like stable prices much better then chaotic prices created by pumps..

I did it on vaultofsatoshi.com 
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:28:53
This is a very good point indeed, but does it make up for me having to transfer money to an exchange (fee included) and then exchange my fiat for bitcoins (fee included). Of course if we are talking a 10% discount then I will save money because the above mentioned transfers probably do not cost me more than 3%. But lets say every merchant started selling for bitcoins and we all now use Bitcoins instead of fiat because it is cheaper for everyone, now the discount doesn't matter anymore, and again I am faced with the question do I buy more or wait for my money to be worth more. Obviously we can at this point argue that I will buy food because else I will die from starvation and so on and so forth. But will I buy less, and in that case will the shop sell as much, and if it can't sell as much will it have to fire people and so on, I mean these are the scary scenarios people picture when talking deflation.

You dont even have to talk to me, but expect responses if you name call or come with postulates. In the future simply down vote and move a long or be ready to get answers :)
@_date: 2014-06-21 21:08:42
Of course I do not know for sure, and a wise chicken once said you shouldt lay all your eggs in one nest no matter how sure you are.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:24:45
Die from what? Be a martyr for who? Are you in any way suicidal? Then I really would love to talk to you if you wanna. There are a lot of places I can link you to online that are here for you my friend.
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:20:16
I agree with you completely, however for the stuff I need now I can just use my fiat as I always have, then I can save my Bitcoins for if they become worth a whole lot of lot and then buy a house. However for Bitcoins to reach a value when they can buy a house, they need to be a medium of exchange (they gain their value from being money and used as such). Do you get what I am trying to say?
@_date: 2014-06-21 20:07:36
Yeah of course you are mostly right except for stuff like miners having to compensate for electrical costs and so on
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:59:17
Ok so if a non clone coin emerged, you would be interested to look into it?Isnt the computer you write on a clone as well? Now we are not talking collapses and so on but the simple idea that a clone in it self is bad. Do you follow the thought?
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:30:24
I understand it is subjective that is why I am trying to create a debate, thanks for your input! :)
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:28:18
What do you mean kiisfm?
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:59:49
for me it is probably Reddcoin
@_date: 2014-05-12 09:29:34
Dear Amazon, I would love to be able to trade with Bitcoins as a payment method on your site.
best regards
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:01:50
deleted, sorry I am a bit stoned and thought I had just come up with a great idea xD
