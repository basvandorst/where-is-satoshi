Bitcoin was created / invented, in part, to give people a way to escape from the market distortions caused by government manipulations of the money supply.

More reasons: 
Many instances of hyperinflation (Continental dollars, Weimar mark, Brazil, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, etc)
FDR's gold confiscation order in 1933.
Private ban on private ownership of gold currency/bullion until 1974 (in the US). 
Numerous capital controls (China, India, U.S.) and KYC/AML laws which allow governments to control money flows, pry into citizen's financial lives.  
Government attempts to cut off financial services for politically oppressed groups ( drug users, immigrants, sex workers, Wikileaks)

You think Satoshi wouldn't realize that trying to sell his holdings all at once would move the market?   Why wouldn't he sell a little at a time?

No.  OpenBazaar has perfectly legal uses.  Whether OB is used for legal purposes or criminal purposes is entirely up to the user.  The developers of OpenBazaar are no more responsible for the illegal uses than the developers of your mail software are responsible if you use email to run a pyramid scheme.

I haven't looked at the code, but here's what they claim: 
Mycelium Local Trader uses your bitcoin private key for registration and authentication with Mycelium servers. The only information retained by Mycelium servers is your bitcoin address, nickname, sell orders with the entered location, and your trade history.
To enhance privacy, Local Trader uses a coarse location based on your network address, or an approximation near the address you manually enter. Your location is only updated when you manually change it from the Change location menu.
Local Trader will log all actions that involve the server, along with the time and the trader nickname. These logs are used for debugging purposes, and deleted after a few days. All trades are of course permanently stored in the blockchain.
All chat conversations are end-to-end encrypted using your bitcoin keys, and their context is only accessible to the people involved in the chat. The only things Mycelium servers receive is encrypted text with time stamps.
