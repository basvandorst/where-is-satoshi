Not for the level of work they put into it with constant tweaks to the scripts and miners and optimization.  They had a full business up and running which is way too much work for a long term scam.
I wouldn't rule out an inside job however, like say a disgruntled developer with low moral standards.  People dont tend to go through all the work of setting up, starting and running a business long term just for a planned scam.  And they’ve been doing this since April 2014, clearly that’s a LOT of work.

There’s still three weeks left in the year.  With Bitcoin that’s like calling the super bowl after the first quarter. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:09:25
And there’s also no evidence of a scam either. So without more info this is pointless speculation and a waste of time. Wait until tomorrow, if their servers never come back up it may have been but at the very least it’s still too early to know anything for sure.

We still have three weeks to go, don’t jinx it!

But we have no idea how much of a cut they were making already is my point. It’s quite possible $60M was a months work for them normally and their cut would have doubled in dollar value as well. They have been running since 2014 after all. 
Do you have any evidence of a scam?  Anything that points to an incident job?  Anything that calls their claims of reporting the theft into doubt?  If so please share!

Should this also work with greenaddress?

And how does that compare to their monthly income since 2014?  You literally just pulled those numbers out of your ass. We have no evidence of a scam so unless I see something fishier than a ‘we’ve been hacked’ post I’m going to reserve judgement.

If it was a scam, why pay out and conduct legitimate business for months straight and then rip everyone off 8 months later?

He’s probably a troll specialist. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:12:17
Compared to what?  What were they making before?  How does this compare?  How much was their cloud business mining daily?  Without any of this info everyone here is just making random ass guesses.

You cant run a national bank and control the flow of money on a crypto based currency .

Its clearly spelled out in wikipedia:

I never said i has to be decentralized, i said the crypto has to be core to the creation of the units of currency as well as the validation of the transactions.  That could be done centrally or decentralized.
@_date: 2019-06-12 09:50:34
You and I do not have the same definition of 'cryptocurrency'.  You seem to be of the opinion that a cryptocurrency is simply digital money employing some form of cryptography.  I use the generally accepted definition that a cryptocurrency not only uses cryptography but that the cryptography is used for the security of the currency, the generation of the currency and verification of the currency independent of a central bank.  This by definition separates crypto from digital money like digicash.

I hope your right but I can’t help but be skeptical that .001 btc will ever be a fortune. A down payment on a house wouldn’t be too bad though.

If a govt can shut down your digital currency then it's not a real crypto currency.

Jita local has moved to Twitter.

No, it’s just that it’s really easy to mentally say ‘maybe it is real and it’s only a little so what do I have to loose?’  And sometimes they will honor it for a very small amount and the person then tries again with a lot more. 
In Jita they also often have alts or other scammers post positive comments like “OMG! Thanks so much! 1 billion for 1 million!” which helps easy the gullible party into sending a test amount.
