This is the cause of the collapse of earth in Peter F Hamilton's Night's Dawn Trilogy. We semi-solved the greenhouse gas issue, but then poisoned the atmosphere with runoff heat, and algal blooms took over the oceans. It's a sidepoint in the books but I thought it was an interesting concept.

The fact that you think the only reason a bunch of countries with different cultures could ever be united under a common goal is 'by force' shows a worrying degree of xenophobia.

Hi, how exactly could this be a scam? Simply holding peoples attention longer than they should be able to by drip feeding more clues? In order to push their other products?
 I'd say that's just (mildly scummy) advertising tactic?
