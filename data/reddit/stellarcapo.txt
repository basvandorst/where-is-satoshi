Yeah , buy from  and have your bitcoins stored in a hardware wallet like Nano ledger

Very much ... Buy the dip
@_date: 2019-08-30 22:42:36
That'll be a good headstart , definitely flipping that for more BTC

Mass buying .... That's what I'm waiting for ... I'm fully aware that there are whales but mass buying (FOMO) ... That's the true drive to Lambo season

I honestly don't understand sometimes .. for something that was $0.70 per coin to what it is today ... Y'all surely panic alot... If it falls buy more , If it pumps buy a fucking lambo

Actually that'll be a win for bitcoin , decentralization wins over centralized shit
@_date: 2019-10-26 23:14:42
Well , I hope you bought the dip
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:41:47
After investing in bitcoin for about 6 years , I've learned two things ; Bull run = more dollars and bear market = more bitcoins
@_date: 2019-10-29 11:59:05
What do you mean "if Bitcoin is chosen as the dominant crypto currency" ... It is the dominant crypto currency
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:43:32
I told people to buy the dip , December is lambo month
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:22:17
They didn't buy the dip�� ... Massive gains today bro
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:55:00
You see , bitcoin specifically is a decentralized market .. so it's based on adaption right. Here's the thing, China banned in 2018 ... That affected the market so bad ... Now they are warming up to ... Thanks to Venezuela and some African countries it was stable .. Once China fully confirms it ... The population is enough to boost it to a new all time high
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:58:32
Pick your poison
@_date: 2019-10-26 10:46:45
China is on the verge of getting into crypto ... That'll be a mass adaption by 2020 we be heading to the moon
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:43:52
2020 we going to the moon

First of all it's not tax , it's transactional fees. If you're around bitcoin atms then you can sell there and not worry about funds going to your bank.
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:23:15
Instead of wishing it won't break 11k , You should've been buying the dip and window shopping for lambos
@_date: 2019-10-17 19:44:44
Well , those are smart lawmakers
