Why would anyone be amazed by that? People have been doing instant transactions online for like 2 decades. Other than some weird religious euphoria there isn't anything amazing visually about making a payment.

I am pretty sure feathercoin, which uses code almost totally identical to bitcoin did actually cancel coins in that way, so it's not even remotely impossible.

men with guns would put him in a cage for using the free market in a way old white men didn't like?

Bitcoin has also only had 75 million transactions in six years, which is about 1/3rd of one day of the number of transactions VISA does on an average day, so of course bitcoin blockchain is tiny as fuck, but the expectation some people have it that someone will eventually want to use bitcoin. And then what?

Step one is to sell your bitcoin for real money, step two is to give your money to the company. 
You may find a guy online that you can pay to do that for you I guess and pretend that is paying with bitcoin.

Is everyone just going to get suckered by the lie this thread title is doing? Microsoft isn't even remotely giving away bitcoin. Microsoft is getting cash that goes into a tango card account. Tango is money that can be used to buy one of 60 gift cards, which doesn't even even appear to include snapcard but some website said a rumor said might have a deal coming someday. 
I mean you might as well say every contest on earth offers bitcoin because you could potentially buy bitcoins with the money you win.

I though the constant thing in this forum was to post how LITTLE VC money went into the early email to try and hype up bitcoin like it was bigger than the internet.

Bitcoin is inflationary and new coins are created every 10 minutes and will be for the rest of your life and until the time your grandchildren are adults. But because deflationary is a claim other libertarian currencies have always trumpeted that so bitcoin just sort of randomly inherited the claim and no one is supposed to think too hard about it or question it too much. Basically hand wave some weird super thin definition of deflation and call bitcoin that.

It's funny to see the math vs the reality of real life where "oh no address collision" has been a pretty commonly occurring thing in bitcoin over the years. With it being a thing where in a mathematically perfect universe it really would never happen but in this actual universe we have been dealing with actual software implementations of RNDs and had collision disasters every 6 months or so with android and blockchain and wallets pulling error headers from random.org and so on and so forth over and over.

I am pretty sure none of this happened and you are trying to get weird internet points by making up some dumb story~!

International transfer stamps aren't a ponzi scheme either. For what it's worth.
