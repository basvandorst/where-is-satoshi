yeah what a piece of shit
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:57:04
i mean as more vendors start using it because it becomes a more stable currency 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:51:41
Wont governments want their cut?  You think the U.S. government is going to let corporations and small businesses use this as their currency if they get nothing out of it?  Unless that is the whole point is to let the government implode on itself.

shhh don't say anything i don't want it to happen now
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:53:20
you honestly think it will be that high?  I just can't see that happening, but then again I am fairly new to this.  My buddy had me get in in Feb.  Could you point me toward a source that actually has the probability and reasoning of it ever getting that high?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:49:08
Right but the point is it is still taxed, so I'm a little confused on where you are going with this.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:55:56
what do you realistically see it getting to by the end of this year?  I don't understand why it would ever get as high as it did.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:41:25
lol im a tax manager so i think about it all day.  but this was a good insight to see where this could go.  I am telling you right now though, there is no way the U.S. gov doesn't do something to fuck this shit up if we start taking them out of the loop.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:36:01
Ok that really doesn't mean anything.  They still tax foreign income
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:34:43
They can outlaw the currency altogether.  If you think of it like that, then there will be no corporate income tax, no individual income tax since there is no USD to tax.  The federal gov won't be making a dime which they obviously need to run the country.  Am I looking at this in the wrong way?
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:15:48
do you happen to have the url for this site?  i am having trouble finding it
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:03:11
lol im holding, but i am always curious my friend.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:01:54
right but you have to realize those people turn them back into fiat currency that they either keep because they are doing illegal stuff anyway, or they put it in their bank accounts and pay taxes on it.  It's only a short matter of time before the bank realizes a lot of money is going into an account and alerts the IRS.  I mean they can launder the money, but like I said, it's usually only a matter of time. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:13:16
it will go up only if it is going to be used by actual vendors though right?  I can't see it increasing unless people are going to use it on a widespread basis, and with governemnts I can't see it getting used that much without them doing something to screw it up.  Take the U.S. government for example.  They might tax the shit out of any income gained from the trading of BTC or just regualr business in general to stave off the adoption of it in the U.S.  Just a thought.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:42:27
at what point would you sell? I mean, is there a certain price it hits and you are just like, "can't hold on to this shit no more," or do you just think its going to keep on rising and rising as more and more people adopt the use of it?  I am hoping the latter happens.  In this for the long haul baby!!
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:33:49
I would Google it and for some reason it would never find that site
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:55:59
DONT YOU TALK ABOUT WOLF BLITZER THAT WAY!!!
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:57:30
i hope they do
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:02:11
I feel like an asshole
