Can you elaborate? Everything I've seen points to big miners, particularly ASICS based Chinese ones like Jihan, fighting tooth and nail against Segwit and then championing BCash. BCash from its birth to its current operation functions in a way antithetical to the decentralized concept of Bitcoin. And while decentralization may not be a necessity for it to be functional, I'm not going to entrust that centralization to the likes of Jihan or Ver.

What Satoshi wanted at Bitcoin's creation isn't necessarily what's best for it, but nonetheless, Bitcoin's current state does not mean that it's also its final state.
Since the crux of your argument is that the people behind core should have published studies, can you point me to the peer reviewed studies by Cash's developers? Do you agree with the philosophies of its champions, like ex-pat Ver who said just two days ago that insider trading is a non-crime? Do you really think Jihan really cares about the studies or Satoshi's white paper, or do you think he cares about the fact that Segwit rendered Bitmain's antminers obsolete? To me the only Bitcoin-like alt is LTC.

My mom always calls LTC lightweight. She's not wrong but it's my favorite alt anyway.

It doesn't really analyze how BCash is a plan by centralized miners to make more money by hijacking bitcoin. To only look at fees in this moment is just a snapshot of one aspect of comparison.

That...doesn't make sense. You disagree with both the ability to have abortions, and the ability to not have abortions? You want neither Net Neutrality or Net Neutrality? What?
And besides, that just reeks of laziness. Just because a particular platform doesn't perfectly reflect your views doesn't make it completely invalid. That means it is the closest representation, and perhaps a first step  to what you do want (ie ACA being the first step to UHC). You need to learn to make the best, or least worst choice, because to just say they're both as bad and not vote at all is to willingly throw away your voice and stick your head in the dirt.

But right here, you would be going against your own interests then to vote for, or not vote against, the "team" that does want to make moral decisions about what you do with your body. You can obviously disagree on other aspects of their platform, but that is an example of how you do agree with a particular side. Further, a lot of voters are mobilized on this single issue alone, particularly among those that do want to make moral decisions about your body.


This is another confusing bit for me, because you acknowledge it's the corporations but lay the blame at government for trying to implement legislation to check the corporations. It's those private interests that are lobbying against Net Neutrality, and who try to capture regulatory agencies (as they have done with this administration's FCC) because the free market actively conspires to make itself less free. This also seems to mean that you again would be more naturally aligned with a particular "team" over the other.


I agree, it's foolish to think either side can fix everything, or that either have been or could be perfect representatives. But you're letting perfection be the enemy of good. First and foremost, voter apathy (which is often due to the assertion that both sides are the same, which is why I'm engaging you on this) is the biggest culprit. It means that there are huge swaths of the population that representatives don't have to represent. If more people voted for the least worst option, eventually you start moving upwards until the acceptable options get increasingly better. Instead, the Overton Window has moved sharply to the extreme right, and Eisenhower would be called a spineless socialist today. Instead of continual progress, it's a race to the extreme, and to the bottom.


ACA has major issues, but I don't know by what metric it would be a complete disaster. It also doesn't make sense to me to say there are private alternatives, because without a public option, the ACA is all about private insurance being accessible through an open marketplace. To say that government can't solve healthcare doesn't ring true to me when every other developed nation on Earth has UHC that does it better and cheaper; the US pays twice per capita the OECD average, and we have lower lifespans and higher infant mortality for it. It's like the new American Exceptionalism is being unable to do what others have done successfully for decades.


Then vote, especially in primaries where you have more power to select a candidate who does more closely align with your views. Without being engaged civically, it's just empty complaining about how ineffectual the government is, while giving yourself a way out of having to learn more about the issues or candidates. And that is lazy. The government is nothing more than people, and will only function as well as the people it's composed of are. It's failed in many ways, and yet also built national infrastructure, put a man on the moon, and created the internet. It also regularly does a [massive amount of other tasks that completely and positively affect our daily lives]( that go unnoticed because that's not worthy of headlines.


The US has and its system has had many failures, but also many triumphs. Unfortunately, top-down hierarchical structures will have to exist in any enterprise, public or private. The only alternatives are anarchy, from which hierarchies based on power and resources will still emerge like the warlords of Somalia, or a fully post-state society like Marxist communism, which is unlikely until humans are completely post-scarcity. So, if we have to deal with these hierarchies barring major and likely disastrous change, it makes sense to me to continually work towards a better version of it.


I'm a big believer in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. But I think looking at fiat is a good example of why I think that, barring complete catastrophe, current power structures are here to stay. Fiat's value is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, which is the best guarantee of value you can have. The reason is because for that to no longer mean something, the nation would have to have completely unraveled, and any way in which that could happen would mean complete global disaster.

I have wanted to get into Bitcoin for a while, but with the jump in prices and my lack of any expendable funds at the time, I waved it off. I feel like if I'm ever going to get in on it, this is the time. Mt. Gox has had one of the lowest prices among the exchanges, I imagine because of this withdrawal issue. I have been awaiting verification, but could you elaborate on what exactly is going on with Gox and why this has made its BTC value plummet? Basically all money and BTC one would have is stuck there for now?

Well, come on now. I have BTC, as well as a few alts, but they have outpaced fiat specifically because their value is simply due to speculation. That is not good for an actual usable currency, in which we require a degree of stability. If your savings could be worth 30% less tomorrow, just because, why save at all? What if the value of your debt quadrupled in a year like BTC has?
The dollar is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. That doesn't make it perfect or eternal, but it does make it extremely safe. That is why it is the eminent international currency and store of value.

Anyone who buys a treasury bond, from US citizens to other national governments. I used to get them from family members when I was young to save. The reason why is the same reason why the US dollar is the world standard - it is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. I know a lot of BTC lovers hate fiat, but the US dollar is backed by the biggest economy and strongest state in the world, and that makes it the world's safest investment.
Additionally, though US debt is enormous, debt is usually measured as a percentage of GDP - the US is under 80%, whereas Japan is over 240%. The US falls around Germany and the UK. So essentially, the US can shoulder a massive debt because of its massive economy.
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:23:22
In all likelihood, something cataclysmic for the US and by extension the world at large. I'm talking nuclear conflict or a natural disaster like no one alive has witnessed. The US is allied with half the world, and economically entwined even with rivals like China. The other option is a slow descent while the world becomes more multipolar and nations like China, Brazil, or India become regional powers that erode US influence. China is the single biggest contender, but they are surrounded by American allies or nations they've angered over territorial disputes, and they lack any real ability to project military power past their own shores. Even then, other nations rising down the line just means a more marginalized US, not its outright failure. While those examples are about being outpaced, more actual damage could probably be caused from within. The banks and speculators that caused the housing bubble and recession, or the Congressional obstruction over raising the debt ceiling that resulted in S&amp;Ps credit downgrade are examples of how rot in both the private and public sectors can severely damage the economy, but even then, neither were close to resulting in the US to outright fail.
@_date: 2017-04-25 05:58:40
Only by S&amp;P, but you're right the US was still downgraded.
Also, it wasn't because of debt, but more specifically because of the GOP's failure to increase the debt ceiling, which is something that has been regularly done throughout the US' history (and since WWII, done more by Republicans). S&amp;P specifically said that Congressional discord around this issue was the reasoning for their decision. The failure to raise the debt ceiling also resulted in the sequester.

Nice big red flag.
You complain about the DNC, even though it like all political parties are private entities that can back whoever they want. I think we can both agree that the likely person would be the lifetime Democrat with a former two term Democrat President husband who served in the prior Democrat administration over the lifelong Independent (who I admittedly vastly prefer myself)? They showed preferential treatment, they didn't change votes. Yeah they shot themselves in the foot, but they were well within their rights to do what they did, and further, it was the expected thing to do.

Assange isn't a journalist. He does not report the news. He provides confidential documents to the public that he obtained. The way the DNC files were obtained was through Russia. Whether intentions or not, and his lending credence to conspiracy theories shows a leaning to the former, he functioned as a mouthpiece for the Russian government.
I already explained the obviousness of why the DNC would support the safe lifetime Democrat over the outsider lifetime Independent. If you can't wrap your head around that, that's on you.

You must be a troll because clearly you're not discussing in good faith, and keep having to project by calling everyone liars. Still worth blowing up this "Russia is fake news!" nonsense, which Politifact called 2017's lie of the year.


Are you Russian? You seem to have trouble understanding me. I said Assange hinted at upcoming proof about Seth Rich, but nothing was ever released and he just stopped talking about it. Why does releasing information necessitate disclosing who the source is, particularly when Wikileaks does it all the time?
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:20:24

The CIA is not the only American intelligence agency. Again, it has also been corroborated with allied intelligence agencies.
The CIA didn't lie about Saddam, its report had several qualifiers and did not consider its assessment to be of high confidence. The Bush administration had been discussing a war with Iraq as early as 2001. Blame Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Bolton (who Trump recently hired) and others in the administration for their hard-line hawkish stance, and their decision to misrepresent intel reports as completely conclusive.
The Gulf of Tonkin incident was a lie by President Johnson, not the CIA. The CIA, Pentagon, and President knew full well what happened, and it was the President that used it as a pretext.
In your other comment, that whole article links to a video that doesn't even exist. Why would you read this trash and not be bothered to read the basic Wiki I provided?

Is that why rural areas have lent overwhelming support to this administration, for instance? Because it's the embodiment of the golden rule?
Look, I'm not trying to say that everyone in a rural community is dumb or bad, or that every city dweller is educated or good. Rural Americans are Americans all the time, and also deserve the best of what this country has to offer. But come on, man. Other developed countries look at us as completely backwards - our crumbling infrastructure, our archaic labor law, our terrible healthcare system, or failing education. If only because they don't have the efficiency of density and the money of urban locations, rural areas are lagging even more behind in all of these. What frustrates me though is their continued political support for actively hindering development and supporting regressive policies. Yeah neoliberals aren't exactly a big help either, but now we have evangelicals who believe creationism should be taught in schools supporting a thrice married womanizer who cheated with a paid-off porn star, and xenophobic nationalists who claim to be the true patriots while marching in defense of monuments to Confederate traitors. With globalization and dying sectors like old energy leading to the decline of rural areas, I understand the anger and frustration that is beginning to boil over, but at the same time, it always seems to be coopted by those that'll just make it worse.

I wish we could cut you loose, especially after reading your comments. By and large, rural areas have worse education and healthcare, contribute less economically, and are cultural vacuums of regressive backwards values. While the crack epidemic of the 70s and 80s was because of urban decay, now the cities are revitalized and rural communities are dying, causing them to be at the forefront of the opioid crisis. Keep your flyover and southern and Appalachian states with their disproportionate voting power alongside development indexes that look closer to Eastern Europe than a developed nation. But hey, I'm sure coal is coming back to West Virginia any day now, the South will rise again, and those glimmering meccas of culture and finance that are the flyover states will show us what's what.

There's usually a lag before the gains from BTC's rise make its way to altcoins. If anything, it's a good opportunity to trade between BTC and alts.

There's this thing called importing shit. Not every country has enough agriculture to sustain their population. The cities, which happen to be where the educated professionals, the jobs, the centers of finance, the corporate headquarters, and the source of culture is situated, already pay in the form of subsidizing rural areas. They could pay to get it from elsewhere, too.

I mean dude, this genuinely reads like some 1950s red scare thing. I'm taken about enough to comment because if anything, the world is seeing a glut of far-right nationalist ideological movements. Even self-described Communist states have embraced market capitalism, like China. When it comes to Marxist forms, no one's ever been close, unless someone's managed to achieve the complete dissolution of the nation state.
