Yep...what I wanted to do in the first place, but breezed through Coinbase's instructions instead of actually reading them. It's been changed now and is just a matter of leaving the site url blank on the code snippet.

Found this part to be the best: "Authorities generally advise consumers to protect against possible identity theft from such breaches by keeping close watch on their bank statements and using credit card monitoring services, among other tips."
In other words, "Authorities believe the best way to prevent identity theft is by quickly catching identity theft once it occurs".
If only people had a means of paying for things without having to leave access to their funds live online...

Had the same problem too, so I kept it under the author byline.  I'm sure more features will eventually come with integrating into Wordpress and other content sites.  No need to tip, as just want to show it in action on my site baseballcrossing.com I posted above.

The secondary ticket market (and primary ticket market for that matter) is just waiting for something like this to disrupt the current model.  The biggest breakthrough in the last two years was Stubhub moving to an "all-inclusive" fees model, which essentially was just tacking on the 10% buyer fee prior to checking out.  It's not that they have no fees, they are just already included.  As a seller on Stubhub, it's currently a 25% cut that is taken away (10% on top of the price you want, plus 15% selling fee).  All this does is drive up the secondary market price by 25%.
Not to mention that although the transfer process of tickets has gotten much more secure, the colored coins / blockchain technology could really ensure that your tickets are guaranteed to be what you are actually purchasing.  Not to toot a horn here, but as someone who has worked for professional sports teams and dealt with third party ticket services, this use of the blockchain for this purpose is very exciting.  
Do you have any sort of plan / working model for implementing this ticketing service?  Exciting stuff, would love to be involved in something like this

I actually made my first btc purchases ever this week. A $70 rug on Overstock, one way flight for $130 on CheapAir, and a roundtrip train ticket on CheapAir for $32.  Rebought same amount after every purchase.

Definitely makes more sense to put the tip button at the bottom of a given article. Would be like tipping the waiter before your meal. I couldn't quite figure out how to get it inline with the other social buttons through the social plugin I use.  Probably not difficult, just my amateur coding skills.

C'mon now. The first definition listed for debate is: "1. To consider something; deliberate." :)

To me it's more about moving towards mass adoption.  I am a very technology savvy individual, but even for me following the cold storage process seems like a hassle and something that the majority of average individuals would have a lot of trouble with. Is it in my best interest to follow the step-by-step guide and try cold storage? Probably.  But, I think the only way Bitcoin becomes widely adopted (talking the masses here) is if it's as easy as creating a secure wallet through the means of a Coinbase.  So, with that in mind, I'll trust them for now.

Just as confused as the rest of you, but my optimistic side wants to say perhaps could be Paypal trying to one-up / compete with Apple's announcement of mobile wallet tomorrow?

I love when I get just the tip!

Took me about 45 seconds to make the custom button and add to all articles on the baseball site my brother and I started together during the MLB season (baseballcrossing.com)...not trying to self promote, just wanted to show how easy it actually was to make and add to a site!  
He gives me a hard time for talking about bitcoin, so any tips will be going to me until he changes his stance :)

Thanks for the shout-out!  It was a cinch and if I'm a content creator (referring to other folks out there, not my for-fun blog with my brother), it seems like really a no-brainer to add a simple button that could generate you additional revenue.  In the future, it really makes sense that we could see certain sites shift from advertising biz models to micropayments (assuming bitcoin continues to spread).
Also, you had to link to the article with an incorrect prediction?! ;)
@_date: 2014-07-23 14:35:09
Really?  I would think this would be something extremely relevant to the Bitcoin community.  Just because it doesn't have the word Bitcoin in the article doesn't mean it shouldn't be included here.  This is a much bigger deal for the sake of Bitcoin than a 1 minute NSFW video.  
Stubhub, owned by eBay, which also owns Paypal having their customers hacked isn't relevant for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:28:47
If that's the case than it's a flaw in what should be allowed in this sub.  Mainstream news sources and major companies are increasingly checking this reddit sub for Bitcoin news.  Even posting press releases directly to it.  To be able to show why using Bitcoin would prevent cases like the Stubhub hacking from happening seems pretty necessary to be included if Bitcoin is going to start being more widely adopted by individuals.

Glad it's decent.  Thanks for the tip!  500 bits @_date: 2014-11-18 16:14:51
Thanks! That's where it makes the most sense to put it and where I'll end up putting it once I get around to it. Do think it would be great to somehow integrate with Wordpress and content site to be able to a) have different tip buttons for different authors or b) have different tip buttons generated for different articles.  The same total tip amount is displayed on every article.
But as I just wrote in an email to my brother "The application for people to easily send $.10 or $.25 to the author for an article could be huge. Someone I don't know, from god knows where in the world, just sent me a quarter for the article I wrote and it's pretty darn cool"

Secondary ticket market can really use Bitcoin adoption, glad to see a broker incorporating it. Would be nice if they offered a discount for using bitcoin though, which I presume other secondary brokers will do once following suit and accepting it. Not only do you have to pay decent % fees for your merchant processor, but you also have to pay a brokerage fee unless your company physically own the tickets. This is why Stubhub charges a 10% few when you buy tickets (now automatically included in the ticket price to make people think they're not paying fees) and also takes a 15% cut of tickets sold.

As someone that uses Coinbase to store my bitcoins, this is going to be a great feature. Since I've been debating whether or not to move some into cold storage, I think this will be a nice alternative to secure larger amounts.
It seems to me like Coinbase is trying to move towards as easy of a transition for the average person from a normal bank account as possible. Your wallet now serves as almost a "Checking Account" where your vault is now your "Savings Account".
