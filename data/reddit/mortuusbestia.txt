At the moment? Bad things.
We simply don't have the transactional capacity at this stage.
 In the event of a full blown crisis I would though expect the incentive for miners to finally adopt an increased blocksize to become obvious and we would finally begin to scale.
So... short term bad, long term good.

Signing transactions does not require the Internet.
Your question is like asking how it's possible to type up a document without being connected to the Internet.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:47:36
There are a variety of methods, most revolving around creating the tranasaction on a watch-only wallet, transferring the transaction details to the airgapped offline device for signing, then transferring the signed transaction back to the hot device to broadcast.

Let's work with this a second.
Massively distributed mining can only occur at an economic loss to the individual, any system needs to embrace that fact.
100 million people mining for themselves is flat out stupid, 100 million people mining in pools means each will get insignificant dust and is again stupid.
However, 100 million people mining in pools for the benefit of the pool operators might be quite clever.
Imagine 21 abandons the pointless in-device mining model and instead markets their chips in "charity boxes". You plug it in, select the pool operated by the charity of your choice and feel warm and fuzzy as $10 a month gets added to your utility bill.

In-device mining isn't relevant for this demo or actually anything.

A situation where Bitcoin is so pervasive that no one has any difficulty acquiring Bitcoin from a multitude of low friction sources.
At such a point simultaniously loading all of the btc utilising devices on your home network by simply pressing the "load my devices" button on any basic wallet becomes standard, making the entire notion of in-device mining utterly redundant.
People don't need to buy Bitcoin dust at a loss through their electricity bill when they are already paying for their electricity bill in Bitcoin.

100,000,000 transactions a day is only going to happen with low fees.
100,000,000 $0.03 transactions a day split between 100,000,000 in-device miners still only amounts to $0.03 a day each.
At such a transaction level Bitcoin would be so pervasive that no one would have difficulty acquiring Bitcoin to simply load their devices. In-device mining never makes sense unless your business model is off loading said mining chips onto utter mugs.

This simply is not the case.
We need larger blocks to facilitate actual adoption. More businesses and services using the Bitcoin blockchain means them running full nodes.
Too many people look at our node numbers and confuse stagnation with maintenance, growth should be our focus.
Bitcoin can and will be supplanted if we do not grow to a critical mass, we are no where near that yet.
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:47:26
Gradual size change depending on demand is precisely what we will get.
It's just changing the block size limit, not the size of actual blocks. Bitcoin won't suddenly see 20x increase in usage, but it will be able to continue to grow naturally without the unknown damage of being purposefully halted.
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:24:13
Bollocks to that. This time wasting is pointless, someone just needs to step up and present the code to get Bitcoin back on its original and intended track of organic growth and ever wider adoption.

Very well said.
This goes hand in hand with certain individuals vocal opposition to a modest and straightforward increase in the Max block size, say to 8mb. A simple change that breaks nothing and allows Bitcoin to continue its growth in adoption but because some people think that in the future multi gig blocks will be unfeasable they are trying to force us down a certain path today.
 They are trying to cause unnecessary harm in the present in order to support their view of a comparatively far off future.

From the very beginning of Bitcoin, and forever and onwards, owning an entire Bitcoin is an extreme rarity.

You can ask them to honor the IOU, just like with coinbase.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:02:26
Exactly this.
The recomendation was correct as if most people ran Bitcoin QT/XT as their actual wallet then most people would get their coins stolen.
I run a full xt node on a seperate machine from my cold storage or daily wallet. It is simple, storage and bandwidth are absolutly trivial concerns for me and always will be.
 Put simply if Bitcoin grows at a steady pace then upgrading will be inexpensive as technology develops. If however Bitcoin suddenly spikes in popularity upgrading will be inexpensive in comparison to the vast increase in the value of my coins.
So long as those reasonably invested in bitcoins future understand how running a node directly benifits them then we shouldn't see such a drop off again. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 03:55:28
It's either willful deception or technical ignorance on Cobra-Bitcoins part there.
Xt will only fork if it has support from a super majority of miners, untill such time xt maintains complete consensus.
The reality is that running XT is the only way Coinbase can guarantee their customers coins are on the correct Bitcoin chain, no matter how this plays out.

It is probable that the person/persons going by the name of Satoshi do control a large number of Bitcoin.
By the nature of the Bitcoin system all they can actually do with them is give them to other people.
This isn't actually a problem.

@_date: 2015-06-27 08:19:13
It seems this always has to be explained but it's not about the Greeks themselves rushing out to buy Bitcoin but rather people observing the situation and deciding some money in a not fiat asset might be a prudent investment.

More than 10 years ago I put £10 into an online casino on a whim, I fancied trying the roulette. I Martingaled my way from that £10 all the way up to over £900 in one evening. That was a lot of money to me back then, told myself not to be stupid and I would quit as soon as I topped £1000...

It's really impossible to discuss this without engaging in very broad generalisations.

All generally areas of predominantly male involvement.
It's worth clarifying that Bitcoin does not need women to use it in order for it to succeed, but rather as Bitcoin succeeds women will increasingly need to use it.

But aren't you overlooking that nodes check the validity of blocks as they propagate? (Unless I am mistaken)

I don't believe that is correct.
When people no longer needed to use a full node client as their wallet they no longer run the program on their computer, hence the drop in number.

They aren't "dealing with those Satoshis manually" they have an automatic function on their day to day wallet to keep the devices on their network topped up to set levels.
The world that 21 envisions is one where hundreds of millions of consumer devices across the world, TVs, phones, tablets, PCs, routers ect, are all mining Bitcoin, are all exchanging Bitcoin and where Bitcoin is widely used to purchase electronic goods and services.
To imagine such a world but insist that people won't actually have Bitcoin wallets, containing Bitcoin, is absurd in the extreme.
A world where Bitcoin is ALL pervasive, yet not at all pervasive is non-sensical.
The moment that a "load my devices" function is put into any standard Bitcoin wallet is the moment that the entire notion of in-device mining is made obsolete.

They have yet to articulate a single viable use of in-device mining.
If the genuine aim was to give Internet connected devices access to Bitcoin transactions then the only method slower, more expensive, and less elegant than in-device mining would be attaching a casasius slot on the side.
It's akin to the early days of smart phones, realising people will soon be ordering pizza from their devices but instead of opting for a well designed downloadable app you start pitching dedicated Dominos chips to be built in.

Perhaps my understanding is wrong but wouldn't a single miner with 57% of the Bitcoin hash rate who suddenly made an arbitrary change actually find themselves with 100% of the hash rate of a coin no one else was using?
Theoretically the equivalent of just turning their machines off as the rest of the network continues as before although with the remaining miners popping champagne to celebrate the retirement of their largest competitors?
@_date: 2015-12-03 16:53:56

@_date: 2015-06-08 17:36:57
Everyone being able to transact directly on the blockchain, cheaply and without the necessity of third parties or gatekeepers is a principle as fundamental to Bitcoin as the 21 million BTC limit.
That such a tiny number of individuals have so easily hindered bitcoins natural progression and effectively called into question such a core aspect to the point that this is even up for debate makes me begin to doubt a great many things.
This kind of piecemeal debate of fundamental features is harmful to the whole. If a core dev suggested removing the coin cap we would politely/ not so politlly tell them to GTFO, trying to cripple Bitcoin to force us to rely on controllable third parties should meet the same response.
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:23:06

@_date: 2015-06-10 08:03:38
In the nicest possible way you have this entirely back asswards.
The intention of Bitcoin was a ledger that anyone could directly transact upon, cheaply and without the need to submit to controlling third parties or gatekeepers.
The 1mb limit was a quick and poorly thought through hack to avoid a theoretical attack when Bitcoin was young.
Transaction levels have organically grown with increased Bitcoin adoption and we have only just started to approach the block size limit.
Restricting people's ability to transact is the unknown danger, the uncharted territory and the possibly disastrous change.
Increasing the block size or indeed removing the limit entirely is actually maintaining the currently well functioning status quo of organic Bitcoin growth and unimpeded adoption.

I really don't have the time or interest in helping you learn basic economic principles, but as arrogant as this will undoubtably sound, it is truly in your benefit to try.
The way you cling to the misapplied "greater fool" theory of Bitcoin value is completely at odds with its clear utility. If you genuinely think bitcoin is just digital beanie babies they you are, and this isn't an insult but rather in the technical sense of the word, ignorant of the reality.
 Do your homework and cast aside that greater fool nonsense.
If Bitcoin were assured of success then it would already be far above $10,000. A large part of people's subjective sense of its value, of any money, is confidence in its security, that it will retain its value. Anyone buying Bitcoin today and those of us who baught in the past are taking a risk. We looked at Bitcoin, we analysed its possibilities and we risked the value that we put into it in order to help it achieve what we believed to be its potential.
 
 Far more intelligent and successful people than us used their intelligence, skills, creativity and foresight to create something truly remarkable. Their willingness to risk complete loss was an investment, and to suggest that they do not deserve the rewards is to try to strip away the incentives that underpin the endeavours that have throughout history enriched us all.

If the question asked is "how do we get small amounts of Bitcoin to this internet connected device?" then in-device mining is never the answer, it being slow, expensive, and inelegant.
Whether post/pre sale, it is very cheap and easy to move Bitcoin to any applicable device, it's just a transaction.

I think you are forgetting that Bitcoin isnt a proxy for the underlying asset, it IS the underlying asset.
 Estimations of the fiat denomination of offshore accounts does vary but numbers within the region of $30 trillion are not unheard of. The strange reality is that Bitcoin isnt just an entry in a banks database while the "real" money is out moving within the trading portion of the economy, the saver actually holds the Bitcoin, not just an IOU Bitcoin.
To hold $30triilion requires a number of Bitcoin equal in value to $30trillion.

Don't worry about it. I'm as bullish as they come but at this stage it isn't general consumer use that will drive the value of bitcoin. At the moment for Internet shopping Bitcoin is pretty woeful compared to established systems like paypal, the are almost no benefits and a whole heap of negatives that will easily persuade people to stick to what they know.
 But that's fine, merchant adoption is great for when we have already achieved the higher value and people want to spend it. This higher value will come from areas that Bitcoin utility is actually superior, think Internet poker, openbazaar, certain B2B payments, "offshore" holdings and a long list of other things.
 So for now just holding your Bitcoin is the biggest thing you can do to help, reduce their supply and people wanting to make use of it will get the same utility by paying the same amount for less coin.

It is, if you'll excuse the term, idiot proof and if it isn't worth the $119 then you probably don't have enough Bitcoin to even be worrying about this. Paying a small premium to let someone else do the hard work doesn't need to mean giving them control of your money, we don't need banks when simple devices are better.

To be clear, you are suggesting that a group of people be formed with the express purpose of using threats of violence to steal money from the peacefully non consenting. 
 The members of this gang will off course take a cut in payment for their efforts and will certainly need to use a significant amount of funds to procure weapons and cages to use against their victims. Of course I'm assuming that imprisionment would be utilised against those who resist where possible, or are you advocating summary execution for the sake of expediency?
 A subgroup of this gang of thieves (although I quickly envision it swelling to be the numerically dominant part) will be simply trusted to task themselves with distributing the plunder based on certain metrics. These metrics must of course be meticulously collated, measured and investigated to ensure that no potential beneficiaries are gaming the system, because that would be "stealing".
That's just a brief summary of your proposal, and again to be clear, you suggest all this because you fear people might "resort to crime" and needlessly "drain resources" from others?
Think it over again and stay out of It's for the best.

If the price had declined from $100,000 to $350 then there might be occasion to ask what "went wrong" but $1000 to $350 is well within the historic fluctuation trend.
Patience is the key. I'm not one of those ridiculous "the price of bitcoin isn't important" types, a higher valuation is absolutely vital to increased functionality, however it won't follow a straight line.

The price always mattered. Without value bitcoin would have no utility and without vastly increased value it will not be able to fulfil anywhere near its true potential.
 It won't get there in a straight line of course but there is no success scenario for bitcoin without a higher price, they are one and the same thing.

Average Joe does not have a bank account, he lives in a country with a history of economic collapse casused by governments destroying their currency over and over again. He's locked out of the global economy.
For Average Joe Bitcoin is a fucking miracle.
However for the likes of you and me Bitcoin, viewd in the incredibly narrow context of consumer internet purchases, isn't currently as useful as paypal. If that is your only concern then for now at least it perhaps isn't worth your time.
 For me, I finally have savings and they have increased in value by more than 300%. For someone else Bitcoin allows for access to Internet poker the legacy bank system will not permit in their country. For others it is a tool of low cost and guaranteed business to business payments, a way to produce adult on demand videos without the 20%+ fees charged by merchant account providers for "higher risk" customers.
Bitcoins utility is amazing and growing by the day. YOU might not have a use for it now, but the majority of people in the world do, it's just a matter of time before they take advantage.

Quite correct on the technicality. For the avoidance of doubt it is specifically tax evasion that I am endorsing. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:35:31
The ability to hide money in Bitcoin is a feature, not a bug. Continued development of methods of monetary obfustication will lead to rampant tax evasion. Combined with the states inability to simply print Bitcoin as they see fit the state will by necessity shrink.
 A smaller state has less power, fewer areas of coercive influence in people's lives. Avenues of corruption are thus drastically reduced.
 So to be perfectly clear: Bitcoin will allow corrupt agents of the state to hide their financial activities, this will lead to a reduction in overall corruption because the rest of us can and will do the same.
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:04:46
The mechanics of general consumer spending are not affecting the price. People in general are not going out of their way to use fiat to buy Bitcoin in order to buy products they could have far more easily just bought with the fiat.
 We don't need big corps, we need Bitcoin specific uses such as savings free from government seizure, prohibition circumvention via openbazaar and unrestricted poker services.

This is a very common economic fallacy, wealth isn't a zero sum system.
 Countless millions of us with our running water, heating, magic boxes of entertainment and knowledge, wagons with the power of a hundred horses, food from the farthest reaches of the world and many other treasures are vastly more wealthy than any King of ancient times.
 This is possible because value and thus acquired wealth is produced through trade, it is not stolen.
 Bitcoin can not steal wealth, it produces value through its desirable utility which you trade with others.
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:58:19
You simply don't understand what you are talking about. No one is suggesting that if all but one Bitcoin suddenly dissapeared we would just shrug and carry on. 
 Speaking strictly within the context of lost coins the reality is that over time small amounts of the total will be lost, this slight and progressive rise in scarcity will be entirely adequately balanced by a slight and progressive rise in value of the remaining coins.
 Should we ever reach the point where the value of the remaining coins makes small value transaction differ cult then we can allow for division beyond the satoshi level.

 "If there was only 10 BTC left in the world and we were somehow obligated to use BTC we would likely have to pay this owner billions upon billions for each BTC."
This quote or yours clearly indicates that you are either a troll or an astounding dumbass.
 
I repeat, no one is suggesting that if all but a handful of bitcoins suddenly dissapeared over night we would just shrug and arty on. That would be the result of an immense and catastrophic flaw in the technology.
What is being discussed here is how small and steady loss of bitcoins over time will effect the system. The good news is that it will have almost zero negative consequences on the system as a whole in much the same way a Viking burying his horde but forgetting where didn't stop people using gold.
Even better than gold if Bitcoin last long enough or becomes valuable enough that small transactions are made difficult by the scarcity (trying to buy penny sweets when a satoshi has the buying power of $1 in today's money) we can simply allow for division beyond the satoshi point.
Again, try to follow what is actually being discussed here and try to resist being a troll/dumbass.

 The problem of government corruption is not down to the exchange of money for favours/influence but the fact that those receiving the money posess coercive power over others.

No. The increase in value comes from speculation that it's future utility will be more valued. Consumer level demand for simple purchases is currently dwarfed by the demand as a speculative investment...

That's simply the point I'm making, we are in the speculative investment stage, that will be the most influential factor in price and that increase in price will allow bitcoin to fulfil greater utility.

Please do not take this as in insult but I must very clearly reiterate that on a basic level you simply do not understand how and why Bitcoin functions.
You keep incorrectly referring to "democracy" and "the mob" as being behind the upcoming fork. One of the clear problems of democracy is the ability to vote yourselves other people's money.
Bitcoin is specifically designed to defeat this.
Neither the President of the USA, the United Nations, the largest armies in the world, nor a billion people screaming in unison "change the 21 million Bitcoin cap!" could enact such a change.
Only the functional and economic majority of Bitcoin, that is to say Bitcoin itself, could enact the change and they would not do so as that would be contrary to their own best interest.
This is the basic principle of Bitcoin, it's central defense and source of value.
 The functional and economic majority, Bitcoin itself, appears to have decided on a larger blocksize. In railing against a small group of developers being unable to override the will of the functional and economic majority you are actually objecting to the very basic principle that underpins Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:42:08
Buying and holding Bitcoin increases its value which directly increases its utility.

 It was exactly this with Cyprus. I bought Bitcoin because of what I saw happening in other parts of Europe which made the techs long term potential abundantly clear. It's too late to buy insurance if your own house is burning down but your neighbours might suddenly understand its value.
As Greece burns, others will seek a little insurance against the fire spreading and with Bitcoin, given its upside should the worst happen, even a small hedge can protect the rest of your assets.

If banks look at the tech and realise that decentralised cryptocurrency is a superior system that WILL make them obsolete, then the smart move would be to launch their own.
 Keeping all the basic principles of Bitcoin in place but with a new algorithm, allowing themselves to be the first adopters. If this is what R3 does with 30+ of the worlds largest banks and financial institutions then they will completely dwarf bitcoins network effect.
Some might suggest they would never do this due to aml/kyc regulations but we must consider that individual banks are routinely caught laundering money for the most murderous cartels on the planet. If such an industry wide group introduced a new decentralised cryptocurrency they would not face any repercussions.

One of bitcoins foundational principles, and primary defense against political capture, is its decentralised development.
The incredibly modest 2mb blocksize proposed by Bitcoin classic is almost entirely non-controversial amongst miners and economic players. Moreover in a technical sense it presents no difficulty nor danger that can be expressed by any reasonable developer.
More importantly than any effect such a small blocksize increase may have on bitcoins scalability is the opportunity to prove that the "core" implementation developers do not have complete control over the Bitcoin system.
It MUST be shown that such control is an illusion, that there is no crown to seize, no throne to be usurped, no small group of individuals to be coerced by agents of a nation state.
The decentralised development of Bitcoin MUST operate to the principle of code being presented to the Bitcoin system and asking "is this what you want?" and NEVER declaring "this is what you will get!"
Your opposition to this key aspect of Bitcoin is as disturbing as the rampant censorship of this forum.
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:45:48
Indeed, it's a very drastic and fundamental change to the concept of Bitcoin. This is why core is fighting tooth and nail to demonise a fork that threatens their position as the "default" implementation, they realise that given the choice Bitcoin won't follow them down that path.
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:49:54
What is being proven is that no small group of developers actually controls Bitcoin, all they can do is present what they believe to be improvements in the code and the functional and economic majority of Bitcoin is at liberty to accept it or not.
We are seeing that no one is in a position to dictate code to Bitcoin, in this context "going with another team" is reassuringly meaningless.
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:03:56
You have misunderstood how and why Bitcoin functions.
Bitcoin was designed to be immune to political capture through having no central planners, no single point or "core" of failure that could be tempted, coerced or manipulated to act against the Bitcoin system as a whole.
At its heart, Bitcoin is a system of structured incentives built in such a way as to solidify a particular principle; to CHANGE Bitcoin you must BE Bitcoin.
In this sense I refer to the functional and economic majority of the Bitcoin system. This comprises miners and nodes, as well as holders, users, businesses and services.
The place of developers is merely to present code to the system and ASK "is this what you want?".
Bitcoin remains at liberty to say "No" and seek code elsewhere.

"I killed the last guy wearing it and took it for myself!"
Your notion of control is a delusion, there is no crown to seize or throne to usurp. 
The entire basis of Bitcoin is that the functional and economic majority will not fuck itself, nor allow itself to be fucked.
They were presenting code that ran contrary to the desires of the Bitcoin system, the system is routing around them as it was designed to do.
Classic devs will have no more control than the core devs because the is no control.
Bitcoin is proving itself, and it is beautiful to see.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:50:38
You have this precisely backwards.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:27:54
Not at all.
It is entirely about the code. If Bitcoin adopts 2mb blocks by running the classic implementation but the devs behind Classic at some point in the future released a version extending block rewards forever, it simply wouldn't get adopted.
Even if the developers decided to be completely anonymous ;) the code would stand or fall on its own merit.
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:49:51
Oh, really?
Perhaps you'd care to explain the technical reasoning for why centralised relay networks can't function beyond the mystical limit of 1mb blocks?

A major issue us that the "core" devs tried to claim both the ability and the right to dictate code to the Bitcoin system.
That burned a lot of bridges.
They made an awful lot of spurious technical arguments in an attempt to demonise hardforks so as to steer Bitcoin down THEIR chosen path.
That burned a lot of credibility.
Taking some time off might be good for the "core" devs, Bitcoin will chug along just fine.

You have a problem with them not obeying the centralised leaders of "core"?
There was a problem that Bitcoin was designed to fix, using a method of incentives as the tools. The system now appears to be functioning as intended...
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:47:08
I have not sold, but I am seriously concerned.
My issue is that, until there is some protocol development that runs contrary to the desires of the "core" implementation developers, it can not be confidently stated that Bitcoin has not already been captured.
As things stand a small team of individuals, small enough to be bundled into a single government agency van, are claiming both the right and the ability to dictate terms to the Bitcoin system.
The economic/functional majority of Bitcoin wants larger blocks. If core/blockstream devs are in a position to veto it, even a relatively insignificant in logistical and centralisation terms increase to 2mb, then Bitcoin is in a state of failure.
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:09:26
Debatable, but it does clarify how isolated the core/blockstream position is.
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:28:25
The reality is that Bitcoin simply was NOT designed to have large fees.
We need to return to the original path that Bitcoin followed for the majority of its operation, low fees but with a blocksize that steadily increased to accommodate growing adoption.
Slamming up against his arbitrary 1MB limit was a dangerous and unintended change to the status quo. Blockstream should do their "fee market" experimentation elsewhere and let Bitcoin grow as intended.

I'm not saying they explicitly said "we run Bitcoin, this is what's going to happen" as that would be an immensely stupid move, for clarity I do not consider them to be less than very intelligent people. 
Rather by their actions, demonising hard forks, unilaterally deciding to turn Bitcoin into an expensive settlement system, prematurely breaking zero conf before any replacement is avaliable, ect, coupled with their support of rampant censorship they were staking their claim right in the heart of Bitcoin.
Simply put, their desires/goals are not in line with those of the Bitcoin system. It is entirely possible that, seeing the tide turn against them, they will implement an increase in order to retain their position as the "default" implementation.
We must move away from them if only to dispel the dangerous notion that such a thing is needed.

What if a large legacy financial institution like AXA were to fund blockstream in order to hamstring the main chain at 1MB, continuously driving up fees and congestion in order to force non institutional users onto a 2nd tier of their own design comprising of necessarily well funded monolithic payment "hubs" skimming a tiny percentage of each transaction?
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:46:24

None of which have implemented into the Bitcoin system any changes that run contrary to the desires of the "core" implementation devs.
Being opensource any one, at any time, and for any purpose, can present code that proposes changes to the Bitcoin protocol. This is bitcoins primary defense against political capture.
It is a foundational principle of Bitcoin that code be presented to the functional/economic majority of Bitcoin with the question "Is this what you want?", and most crucially NEVER the declaration "This is what you're getting!"
Think, has all of the code presented by the core/blockstream devs had the support of the functional/economic majority of the Bitcoin system?
Now ask, has all of the code presented by the core/blockstream devs been implemented into the Bitcoin system?
We may currently be in a state of failure. 
The only way out of this state is for a development contrary to their desires to take place, 2mb blocksize for example. 
By taking control away from the core/blockstream devs we actually prove that the control itself is an illusion, that there is no throne to seize, no rulers to depose, that Bitcoin has NOT failed.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:48:55
It has shown with clarity that control over Bitcoin is an illusion. The functional and economic majority of the Bitcoin system wanted larger blocks, the "core" devs vetoed that. The Bitcoin system was patient but never subjugated, Bitcoin is routing around the obstruction.

Previously Bitcoin was an unknown, I think banks are coming round.
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:23:43
It's worth remembering that a restricted capacity is the dangerous change to the status quo. For the longest period of bitcoins operation the max blocksize was so far above usage that it may as well have not been there.
As Bitcoin grew the size of each block grew with it, a steady and organic growth system that allowed for wider adoption. BU simply returns us to that original path of growth while not in any way preventing 2nd layer options.
Thanks to innovations in BU it has already been established that my home internet connection and standard PC would allow my node to easily handle 100mb+ blocks, basic 2, 4, or 8mb without question.
We might not need on-chain visa like capacity for ten years or more, with 1gb/s home connections increasingly avaliable across the world and storage getting ever larger and cheaper it's just a non-issue.
Again, on-chain scaling as proposed by BU does not preclude 2nd layer, we can have both.
The 1mb limit is arbitrary, restrictive, and imposed with the intent of forcing people onto 2nd layer. 
For all the talk of LN being decentralised the simple reality is that the economic incentives do not encourage multi-hop paths but rather monolithic payment hubs acting as middle men skimming a percentage. These payment hubs will enjoy incredibly strong network effect only ever enhanced by the constantly increasing on-chain fees that would be needed to open a new and different chanel.
These monolithic hubs would be PayPal 2.0. The average pleb is happy to stick with PayPal 2.0, the average pleb wouldn't even consider moving to some poorly connected upstart competitor if they had to shell out $100 for the privilege of making a $10 purchase on a new hub.
I imagine the first of these monolithic LN hubs will likely be run by blockstream or their investors.
They aren't a charity, they have a business plan.

In the long run, transactions with a fee below what individual miners deem acceptable will never be included in a block.

Core and blockstream are working on off-chain scaling solutions, and that's ok. Almost all of us are excited to see what they will produce in time.
However, there are other teams, other implementations, that are not just working towards on-chain scaling, they have actual released code achieving results on the Bitcoin network RIGHT NOW!
Block propagation is the bandwidth bottleneck we were all concerned with, xtreme thinblocks cuts an average blocksize of 825kb down to only 66kb.
Massive amounts of on chain scaling is possible right now, with code already running on the network.
The longer Bitcoin exists, the more developers it will attract, the more teams will form.

Almost the entirety of the Bitcoin community can not understand code, but because it is open source there need only be enough people who can read it in order to place our trust in it.
In this exact same vein someone in the developing world categorically does not need to run their own node to use Bitcoin. They can simply connect to any of a multitude of diverse nodes from various individuals, institutions and services in order to confirm validity.
We don't need a node for every user, we just need enough.

I got into Bitcoin at sub $50 levels. I didn't invest more than I could afford to lose, but I certainly believed Bitcoin could massively increase in value. Like many my "hodled" coins are staying put until certain price points, the more coins a person has the correspondingly lower these price points tend to be.
This is simply because time is passing and people seek to fulfil their desires while they are still alive. People don't want money, they want what money can buy them.
I'm a leatherworker, I took a portion of my Christmas takings and converted it to Bitcoin. Later I decided I needed a new 30ton press for my workshop which I bought with some of the Bitcoin that had appreciated in value, effectively a sizeable discount.
Even now, with the rational expectation that Bitcoin will massively appreciate, people like myself are spending Bitcoin. Once it plateaus at a higher value as expected with low single digit % appreciation then it will circulate even more freely.
Your theory is running contrary to objective reality, it's as simple as that.

It indicates the need for a market driven dynamic blocksize so miners can respond by "increasing production" of block space.
Say market forces reached a general equilibrium around 4mb blocks roughly every 10mins. If 50% of miners suddenly go dark, instead of facing a vital financial network having its capacity halved for the next month and causing untold economic damage, the miners could increase blocksize to 8mb. 
Going from 4mb every 10 mins to 8mb every 20 mins is a temporary inconvenience rather than an economic shock.

Carefully structured economic incentives is how and why Bitcoin functions. Blockstreams Lightning network fundamentally changes these incentives. With the constant and openly intentional ratcheting up of on chain fees, people will be incentivised to use a single omni-connected hub.
With on chain fees of $10-100 or even more, opening and closing multiple channels with alternative hubs simply won't be viable.

If you go back and read what I wrote you will see that we are almost on the same page, but let's expand a little for clarity.
Individual Non-mining nodes are largely irrelevant to the Bitcoin protocol as they are not explicitly necessary for the relaying of transactions. The trivial task of running up thousands of pointless nodes indicative of nothing is the very reason that PoW mining was developed.
Non-mining nodes of actual influence are those utilised by Bitcoin businesses and services, exchanges, payment processors and spv wallets are examples. The anticipated behaviour of these nodes, as well as market price of Bitcoin in general, is a source of economic data for miners to help them decide what actions/protocol improvements would result in the best outcome for them personally.
Miners pursuit of their own best interest, the principle that a majority of hashpower will not wilfully choose to damage their investments and future earnings, is the foundation of bitcoins utility and value.

I remember the arguments that Bitcoin made against litecoin, that there was no logical sense in having a "digital silver" as the digital gold of Bitcoin could just be transacted in smaller amounts as necessary. There simply is no need to secure multiple blockchains, we needn't fear upstarts as "money is just the first app".
Those arguments holds true, in reverse.
The benefits of blockchains, the variety of uses, can not be overstated. The reality that securing a separate chain for each individual use is massively impractical, that a single high capacity but low cost chain will "rule them all", remains. 
When there is a single chain you use for almost everything on a daily basis, a "digital silver", then there is no need for a digital gold because it is just larger numbers and money is just one more app.
Imagine a small group had seized control of early internet development and declared that it was henceforth only to be used for sending text. That images were a strain on its limited infrastructure, that whispers of video were the rantings of selfish lunatics, and that anyone who wanted such could go use some other system.

Bitcoin is proof of work paired with economic incentive. That's the innovation that had to be invented as you can't constrain people to a consensus with mere code.
This is Bitcoin 101, a majority of miners not committing economic self harm, it's the reason a majority of miners don't destroy their investment and future profits by for example inflating the coin limit.

You are entirely wrong.
At the time of his writing "nodes" meant miners.
I can assure you that the fundamental untility, security, and value of Bitcoin is not based in anyway upon trivially spoofed non-mining nodes or the easily coerced actions of developers or forum posters.
The reason proof of work paired with economic incentives (blockchain/Bitcoin) had to be invented was precisely because you cannot constrain people to an induced consensus via mere code, nor social manipulation.
There is no constraint upon the number or quality of developers, as Bitcoin grows every whim or monatary theory you can imagine will be proposed, but it falls to the miners to choose on the basis of their individual best interest via Nakamoto Consensus what permutation the Bitcoin protocol will take.
Miners of course do not exist in a vacuum, they base the decisions upon a variety of economic data points including but not limited to price, stated and/or anticipated responses of exchanges, businesses and services.
The most basic principle of Bitcoin is that the majority of the functional/economic system will not willingly commit acts of self harm.
An ever growing mass of conflicting developers and prolific voices opining over often controlled channels are not actually part of the system and poses no authority.
Be cautious of those who suggest otherwise.
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:19:34
Miners should be selecting code on the basis of rational self interest, what provides the greatest return on their investment, the identity or pedigree of any given developer should be recognised as irrelevant.

You're not seeing the wood for the trees.
Step back from the code and you will see that Bitcoin is a structured system of incentives that creates consensus, explicitly NOT code that requires consensus.
As an example imagine an implementation that allows for larger blocks is adopted by a majority of hashpower. 
Larger blocks have not actually been created by miners yet so their blocks remain valid according to the current consensus until such time as they have the support of an economic majority of exchanges, businesses and such, who foresee increased value from greater capacity.
At that point a miner produces a block larger than 1MB and the consensus moves with it.

I might disagree with a lot of prominent voices on this forum but that's because I think they are wrong about wanting to change the path of Bitcoin development.

Bitcoin does not require consensus, Bitcoin creates consensus.

As Bitcoin grows, developers will multiply like cockroaches. Take your favourite developer, spit shine his ass revealing him to be the gold plated God emperor of the universe and there will still not be a single element of the Bitcoin protocol that gives a flying fuck.
Any given dev can release code but it is the miners, on the basis of their own self interest as derived from various economic data points, that choose what code to run.
Easily spoofed non-mining nodes and the blatherings of forum posters are of almost zero consequence.

Being forced by artificial blocksize restriction into using LN is the most direct possible route to centralisation.
Bitcoin is not any particular code, it is a structured system of economic incentives. Blockstreams plan alters bitcoins economics in such a way that it incentivises the most efficient means of transaction, a monolithic single LN hub.
Their self aggrandising focus on creating new and exciting tech is blinding them to the economic reality, the reality that most of the world (our target user base) does not give a shit about centralisation, believes government is a benificent power, and that taxes are the price we pay for civilised society.

The fundamental principle that underpins bitcoins utility and value is that a majority of hashpower will not commit acts of self harm.

I call them code monkeys to illustrate that in a relatively short amount of time we will be inundated with hundreds of the fuckers.
 The idea that a global financial system will be left to be curated by 6-12 individuals when by design that very system is decentralised and open to completely permissionless development is laughably naive if not downright ignorant.
Expect an ever increasing number of dev teams and individuals all pushing multiple contrary forks at all times.

You are not intelligent enough to be using the internet unsupervised.
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:41:09
You suggest control but this whole situation most beautifully illustrates the opposite. No one controls Bitcoin, not core devs, not xt devs, not the devs of any future client.
If any attempt is made to restrain progress against the rational self interest of the Bitcoin community then some code monkey is going to root around the damage. Who they are is unimportant and the only "power" or "control" they wield is the ability to fulfil our desires.
Most of us want larger blocks and finally we have a choice.
@_date: 2015-08-24 22:11:22
That is demonstrably not the case, otherwise the small block devs could have just ignored it.
They can't though because they knew then, and are being shown now, that the economic and functional majority of Bitcoin wants a block size increase. This is a combination of not only the clear reasoning of larger block supporters but also the existing understanding on most people's part that the block size was always intended to increase.
Impacting a block size limit and staunchly keeping it in place was the deviation from the status quo, a path that Bitcoin never had any desire to follow.
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:03:54
How are you failing to grasp, even by your own definition, that xt is at all times Bitcoin?
Prior to achieving 75% hash rate it is completely compatible with the Bitcoin protocol. Once it reaches a large majority of the hash rate, and almost certainly of the nodes, then the block size cap will be raised and THE Bitcoin protocol will accept larger blocks.
It is, indisputably, at all times Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-20 07:05:33
Miners are not charities and absent the block reward subsidy will choose not to include any 0 (or unacceptably low) fee transactions.
There is a real cost to including transactions once a block is found, most importantly the risk of being orphaned if your block propagates too slowly due to its size. They will asses this balance and act accordingly in their own best interest.
Mining is a competitive endeavour and a fee market will emerge irrespective of artificially imposed block limitations.
I for one foresee a more likely and secure Bitcoin future comprised of many $0.03 fees as opposed to a few $300 fees.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:32:43
Xt can not at any point be defined as an altcoin. 
By design it is always Bitcoin, it is very important that people understand this in the face of deceptive propaganda to the contrary.
No fork occurs until xt has a supermajority of hash power, before then it functions in complete accordance with the current Bitcoin protocol. Once xt achieves a supermajority of hash power the Bitcoin protocol will recognise larger than 1mb blocks...
... and Bitcoin xt will continue, as ever, to function in accordance with the Bitcoin protocol.
It is logically impossible to define xt as an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:39:02
Not at all. 
Bitcoins whole premise of value and security is built upon the principle that the protocol concensus follows the economic and functional system majority. This means that to harm Bitcoin an attacker must BECOME Bitcoin, rather then just have a show of hands among some non invested outside entities.
 This is how the incentives are stacked to protect itself from outside interference, the same as how the majority of the human race won't commit suicide to solve some perceived over-population issue.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:16:49
To the absolute contrary these events are only strengthening my view that Bitcoin has a bright future.
If larger blocks are implemented at the behest of the economic majority via xt it will prove that the system is immune to capture by a small number of developers.
No dev owns Bitcoin, no dev controls Bitcoin. 
This is the design. It is working as intended and that is beautiful to see.
@_date: 2015-08-02 19:10:16
Yes. This is why the upcoming fork does not concern me. The branch with larger blocks and thus greater utility/value will win out.

If a supermajority of hash power adopts the scalability improvement proposed by xt then the Bitcoin protocol will recognise larger than 1mb blocks.
By the looks of it a supermajority of nodes will be using xt by then and such blocks will be smoothly relayed by the network.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:09:39
Off the top of my head I can't think of a reason why I'd object to this setting being avaliable.
Miners put out empty blocks to minimise orphans, if a number of nodes refuse to propegate empty blocks then that may have an influence in their decision.
On a "if it can be done, it will be done" basis it certainly needs consideration.
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:42:27
Would you be so kind then as to name the mods who dont understand that xt is not and never can be an alt coin so that we can provide them with explanatory materials including simple diagrams?

The permissionless, utterly unrestrained ability to fork Bitcoin is a foundational principle and its primary means of defense against political capture.
If for any reason such as bribery, violent coercion, or simply disagreement, Bitcoin development should be crippled or diverted down a harmful path then there is nothing to stop the economic and functional system majority from forking and thus routing around the damage.
Bitcoin was designed in full recognition that as it grows there will emerge an abundance of often entirely contrary teams of devs who all envision themselves as stewards or saviours of the system via their particular pet theories and projects, as well as nefarious entities with ill intent such as certain nation states and legacy financial institutions.
In reality Bitcoin devs are readily replaceable code monkeys, all of them, with only the ability to fulfil bitcoins desires and never the power to dictate them.
They remain at Liberty to present code to Bitcoin and ask "is this what you want?" but can not declare "this is what you're getting". 
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:29:32
Yes but.... what is also needed is a large initial increase as the network is currently operating well under the capacity that even home fibre connections can handle.
A 100x increase from current block size is feasible on £10-£20 a month domestic connections. (Excluding Australia and Buttfuck, Tennessee or elsewhere in the rural US.) 
We are pandering to the lowest common denominator, to bitcoins detriment.
@_date: 2015-08-18 07:11:27
I'm not sure what has given you the impression that miners operate as a charity.
As the block reward decreases and miners rely more on transaction fees they will simply refuse to put 0fee transactions into blocks.
The difference block size makes is that more space means lower average fees per transaction, think $0.03 rather than $30
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:48:11
That simply and undeniably isn't how xt functions.
Until a supermajority is reached, xt is Bitcoin. This can't be disputed.
Once xt has a supermajority the fork will occur.
The old 1mb chain will be orphaned at this point as the super majority continues on the longest, most secure and utilised chain.
That will be Bitcoin. Xt genuinely by deffinition can not ever be anything but Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:20:41

@_date: 2015-08-24 23:33:03
In the nicest possible way you simply don't understand how this will pan out if BIP 101 achieves the required super majority of 75%.
 Once it hits that the two week grace period kicks. Whatever the motivations someone WILL "stress test" Bitcoin the moment larger than 1mb blocks become allowable, thus cementing the fork.
Miners will leave the future less than 25% minority "core" chain like rats fleeing a sinking ship and not just because technical considerations like massively skewed difficulty and intolerable block delays.
 As has been made clear, by the time the 75% line is reached, and with the knowledge that the percentage will almost certainly increase to almost 100% within two weeks, every economic entity in Bitcoin from payment processors, service providers, wallets and exchanges will resolve to deal exclusively with the BIP 101 chain.
 It simply isn't in their economic interest to support a terminally ill legacy chain for even a moment.
There realistically will be no split, just Bitcoin with larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:09:18
You are missing key understandings of how Bitcoin functions.
Bitcoin is a system of utterly permissionless development. Your example of a 21million+ fork could be presented by anyone today, at anytime in the future or could have been presented at anytime in bitcoins past.
However the mere presentation of forking code does not facilitate a successful fork.
Bitcoins primary defense against political capture lies in the necessity of support from the economic and functional system majority of Bitcoin ( primarily miners &amp; nodes but including holders, exchanges, service providers, wallets ect).
You see to attack Bitcoin an attacker would in essence have to become Bitcoin. Can you imagine the majority of the human race committing suicide to solve a perceived over-population issue?
That's how the economic incentives stack up, it's the innovation at the heart of the system.
There is no "coup" in Bitcoin, no power or crown to seize. You either provide what Bitcoin wants or someone else will.
That's what we are seeing being played out in respect to larger blocks.
 
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:39:49

If Bitcoin achieves its potential this may very well be the most/only influential vote we cast in our lifetimes.
@_date: 2015-08-24 22:51:06
Full blocks are a completely novel situation. For the vast majority of the time 1mb has been in place blocks have been almost nothing but unused space. 
Having vastly more space than currently required has actually been the status quo in Bitcoin. Actually hitting a solid limitation on transactional ability is the deviation from the norm.
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:05:41
Made clear in official public statements endorsing BIP 101 and larger blocks by BitPay, Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Circle.com, KNC Miner, Bitnet.io, Xapo.com, Bitgo.com and others.
Their business models and everyone's investment is directly harmed and in no way helped by a divided Bitcoin.
However the clear reality is that there will be no divide. Legacy miners will simply not remain on the redundant chain as they would swiftly go bankrupt mining effectively worthless coins.
 I really should not have to explain to you that the economic incentives within Bitcoin are designed to encourage miners to follow the consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:52:08
In accordance with the desires of the majority of the Bitcoin community, and this sub, a client intending to allow for larger blocks has been released 
@_date: 2015-08-03 00:10:41
Eliminate fees? That would be madness.
Keep fees low for as long as possible is the aim, to maintain the bitcoin that has been growing from strength to strength.
Imposing an artificial limit is a change to the status quo (although it was there for a while the 1mb limit is only now being hit) and a needlessly dangerous experiment.
Ultimately the only defense that Bitcoin has against "spam" attacks is to actually put the attackers transactions into blocks thus seizing their capital in the form of fees.
Large numbers of 0fee transactions will simply be ignored, miners are not running a charity.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:51:12
If there are a larger number of transactions then fees don't have to go up.
This should be very simple to understand.
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:15:32
You just agreed with me.
When the notion of video games was first invented there were a small handful of people initially involved who were inarguably the worlds foremost experts... until they weren't.
In a few years (a lot less than 20) we will be swimming in devs, with hard forks released on perhaps a weekly or daily basis, almost all of which will be utterly ignored by the economic and functional system majority that comprises Bitcoin.
As per the design.
If however a fork presents features that Bitcoin desires then it will be implemented. People are throwing around ridiculous terms such as "Hostile fork" and "coup" either don't understand the basic design of Bitcoin or they are willfully trying to decieve.
Bitcoin devs are not Bitcoin, they provide code and Bitcoin decides to use it or not. In a short amount of time there is going to be an awful lot of different code variations to choose from.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:02:13
I got into Bitcoin when it was expressly understood that the ultimate aim was to scale it for world wide monetary use, circumventing the need for easily captured third party systems.
I've been patiently waiting for some code monkey (I don't give a damn who, they aren't important) to release a version that allowed for larger blocks.
That is currently xt.
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:53:26
Yes, because it is not and never has been about Gavin, Mike or XT.
It's about core devs obstructing Bitcoin development in an attempt to steer it down a new path of their own liking and design.
If they implement BIP 101 into core, brilliant. If not then the economic and functional majority of the Bitcoin system will just step around them.
That's how Bitcoin is meant to work after all.
Edit: Cheers for the gold!
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:13:35
It's disturbing the number of developers who, knowing they could not present a convincing argument against larger blocks, decided to condem the very notion of bitcoins primary defense against political capture and forceful coercion as well as a foundational principle of the entire system: permissionless code forking.
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:43:38
If we want to make the current "attack" 100x more expensive we could raise the basic required fee to $3.00.
Or... we simply increase block size to 50mb (which my home connection can easily handle) and require only $0.06 fees.

First, let’s count our blessings.
It’s good that there is no “official” organization that can control Bitcoin. Such an organization would be subject to political pressure and ultimately to political capture.
Let’s be grateful that Bitcoin is so capture-resistant.
Second, [REDACTED] allow controversial decisions about the direction of Bitcoin to be made by the market, not by particular developers. They are the method by which we decentralize Bitcoin governance. A policy of never allowing [REDACTED] is tantamount to a policy of letting core developers, not the market, choose how Bitcoin will behave.
 
Consequently, I am unsympathetic to the bitcoin.org policy of forbidding controversial [REDACTED].
This is how the system is supposed to work. If the [REDACTED] are able to persuade the majority of miners, exchanges, and users that [REDACTED] are better, they will win in the end. If not, the [REDACTED] will win. Either way, in the end, the shorter chain will be abandoned eventually, and there will be only one Bitcoin again.
The community has several more months during which to debate this issue, since the [REDACTED] will not occur before 2016. In the meantime, we should focus on improving the quality of arguments and communication so that the [REDACTED] will be resolved in an informed manner.

The intention is for Bitcoin to be here for more than the average lifetime, how does being a dev for the last couple of years make them infallible for the next hundred?

This small group of current devs know how to code, ergo they know what's best for Bitcoin?
As ridiculous as stating that central bankers are good at arithmetic, ergo they must know what's best for an economy.
This small groups attempts to change the course of Bitcoin, to make it an expensive settlement network for a small group of financial service providers, is ideological and manifestly not technological.
Had Satoshi randomly chosen 2mb for his poorly considered limit then Bitcoin wouldn't be grinding to a halt at 1.5mb. The network can handle more, easily. There is absolutly no technical reason to be artificially restricting access to the blockchain and intentionally forcing up fees now or in the near future, small block advocates are trying to subvert Bitcoin to match their future vision...
...their ideology.

Please clearly articulate what "dictatorial" powers that bitcoins foundational principle of permissionless development bestows upon anyone.

It really doesn't. 
Miners are under no obligation to include transactions, they are incentivised by the competition for profit.

Whatever maximises their profit will be the choice, free riders will not be accepted.

Exactly! More people need to understand that the network is still being forced into doing most of the work anyway when it gets spammed with transactions.
 The only way to discourage this is to actually capture the attackers working capital by finishing the process and simply putting those already relayed and validated transactions into blocks.
We can then laugh at them as they fund the network, it's the only defense an open and decentralised payment system has.
@_date: 2015-07-30 12:42:22
I think you have an incomplete grasp of the incentives within this system.
The last thing an attacker wants is for their transactions to be put into a block. Their ideal scenario is creating such a backlog that genuine users are forced to continually ratchet up their fee to be included in a block while the attackers transactions eventually leave the mempool with minimum capital expended.
 The only defense the Bitcoin system has is seizing the attackers capital by placing their transactions into blocks.
If an attacker has $billions in resources to "attack" Bitcoin then we must have the capacity to let them buy $billions worth of Bitcoin, driving up its value for the benefit of holders (who are the people running nodes) and laugh as they give it to miners in fees.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:29:41

@_date: 2015-07-08 16:44:55
Because of the small block size most of the attackers transactions won't get into blocks. Genuine users will still have their fees forced up to get priority but the attackers efforts are successful without actually costing himself much, relatively speaking, because they drop out of the mempool over time having achieved their goal.
We need larger blocks so that we can actually put an attackers transactions into a block and thus capture his acting capital.
For example, with 100mb blocks, forcing average transaction fees up to only $0.06 over the course of a year would genuinely cost an attacker over $1billion. 
We need to laugh as we capture attackers money and use it to fund the network, it's the only real defense for an open and decentralised payment system. 
Until we can do this I'd say Bitcoin is vulnerable.

They remain at Liberty to present code to Bitcoin and ask "is this what you want?" but can not declare "this is what you're getting".

@_date: 2015-07-07 09:33:56
Like he said before it's about achieving a balance.
To make the current "attack" 100x more expensive we can either have $3.00 minimum transaction fees or raise the block size to 50mb and have $0.06 fee transactions.
The solution that would allow greater utility and stronger adoption is obvious. I run a full node and my home broadband is up to 76Mb, totally uncapped for only £10 a month, so don't worry.
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:47:16
Your missing my point which is that the energy expended to mine an empty block is essentially the same as mining a full block. The energy required to mine a 1mb block is essentially the same as mining a 1gb block.
To say x amount of energy is required per transaction is simply false. Anyone who thinks energy use will be a problem in bitcoins future simply doesn't understand how the economic incentives function.

@_date: 2015-07-31 21:30:41
You have that precisely wrong. Seriously, think it over again.
A 1mb block size does not place any restriction on the number of transactions that an attacker can broadcast and have sitting in the mempool.
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:10:57
Ultimately the only defense avaliable to an open and decentralised payment network is to take the attackers money. We need the capacity to bankrupt anyone and laugh while they fund the network.
For example 50mb blocks and double average basic fees (about $0.06 I believe) would make this attack at least 100x more expensive by actually confirming attacking transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:57:01
In terms of transactions that go into blocks there is no such thing as "spam". A transaction is either valid or not.
Larger blocks simply means faster backlog clearance and that it will be far more expensive for someone with the intention to fill blocks beyond disruptive fee levels to actually do so.
 With small blocks we are clearly unacceptably vulnerable to actors wishing to drive up fees and slow the confirmation of transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:13:26
They are not well funded at all and with such a limited block size they don't need all that much.
The last thing an attacker wants is for their transactions to be put into blocks as it is only at that point, when we have captured their attacking capital, that it actually costs them money to conduct the attack.
As genuine user transactions begins to aporoach the limit we become more vulnerable. The attackers transactions will steadily force genuine users, who actually want to see their transactions confirmed, to ratchet up their fees. The attackers transactions having achieved their intention will then fade from the mempool thus returning the capital to the attacker and allowing them to continue without great expense.
The only defense that Bitcoin can have is to have enough additional block capacity above genuine users needs in order to confirm an attackers transactions, thus seizing their capital.
In such a scenario a $1billion "attack" takes the form of an attacker buying $1billion worth of Bitcoin, raising the value and increasing the wealth of holders/node operators, then giving it all to miners as fees.
In reality that $1billion attack has become a $1billion donation to Bitcoin.
Intentionally or not, advocates of small block sizes are acting to remove bitcoins only defence with eventually terminal consequence.

Bitcoin xt does not allow for larger blocks.
WHEN/IF they release a version that does allow for larger blocks people will assess it and it's process of confirming majority consensus before implementation and go from there.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:06:03
It's a balance. 
Raise the block size to 50mb and basic fees to $0.06 and it has just become 100x more expensive to achieve what they are doing.
If it cost $6,000 a day to clog the network then it would suddenly cost $600,000 a day instead. If an entity wants to expend that much money on attacking Bitcoin then I say we find a way to accomidate them, take their money with a smile :D
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:26:12
Your opinion on this matter is frankly bizarre.
Forcing fees up so high via arbitrary block crippling that third world users can't afford to make transactions is not to their benefit.
The vast majority of first world Bitcoin users do not and will never run full nodes, they don't need to. The same applies to third world users but at least with larger blocks and lower fees they can get all the benefits of Bitcoin.
We do not need a billion nodes, we want a billion users.

It's an interesting thought.... but simply not possible.
Because of how Bitcoin mining works, in device-mining could only ever produce dust, economically insignificant amounts.
Think of a pizza. Divide it between 4 people and 4 people will be satisfied. Divide that same pizza between 1000 people and 1000 people go hungry.
The blocksize is the pizza and each of the millions of devices with on board mining is just another hungry mouth.
The reality is that 21 have yet to articulate a single consumer use case of in-device mining that could not be better served by simply loading the device with some Bitcoin from your phone.
@_date: 2016-02-06 21:58:25
Your apparent concern suggests that you have not quite grasped how Bitcoin functions.
Developers do not have control of Bitcoin.
Core is not losing "control". Classic is not gaining "control"
The functional &amp; economic majority of Bitcoin is not choosing classic over core, they are just choosing code that facilitates 2MB blocks.
The classic devs have precisely zero ability to impose changes beyond that upon the Bitcoin system. No matter where their ideas for protocol change originate. Be it reasoned debate, some strange voting system or even a biologically implausible tombola system where protocol changes are genuinely pulled out of Gavin's gaping arsehole, it simply doesn't matter.
The delusion of a "default" implementation is being rightfully dismantled. 
Developers do not have the power to dictate terms to the Bitcoin system, at most they may have the skills to produce code that fulfils the desires of the functional and economic majority.
Bitcoin IS working.

@_date: 2015-07-31 10:13:33
What part of my above post should I clarify?
With almost full blocks as standard, the intention of small block advocates, it would require minimum resources to force genuine users to ratchet up fees. The key thing to realise is that attackers do not want to be included in blocks, that would lose their capital, but rather to create an ever growing backlog of unconfirmed, thus essentially costless, transactions that force genuine users to continually outbid.
Genuine users want to be put in blocks, attackers do not want to be put in blocks. Bitcoins only defense is to put them in blocks and take their capital.
This requires larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:50:41
Stop wasting internet.
@_date: 2016-02-11 11:56:46
The most generous assumption regarding anyone who uses the term "coup" to describe this situation is that they do not actually understand how or why Bitcoin functions.
If the delusion of "control" they think core possesses and which could be "stolen" by classic actually existed then Bitcoin would by definition already be in a state of failure.
Bitcoin is not meant to have a seat of power, a centralised fallible core, a small group of eminently corruptable or coercible individuals.
If the functional and economic majority of the Bitcoin system decides to run code that facilitates 2mb blocks then that's all that happens.
Core developers wouldn't be "fired", classic won't have "control", any changes that anyone at all wants to make to Bitcoin would continue to require the consent of the functional and economic majority.
As per bitcoins design.
@_date: 2016-02-07 19:04:30
The very reason the fork is happening is because developers do not control Bitcoin. Developers do not have the power to dictate anything to the functional and economic majority of the Bitcoin system. All these competing groups of devs can do is present code that Bitcoin is at liberty to decline.

They are not trying to control Bitcoin, such control does not by design even exist, they are simply expressing their confidence that Bitcoin actually works.
Bitcoins key technological breakthrough is a majority of hashrate, backed by nodes, users, businesses and services (essentially market forces) being the means of CREATING consensus without first requiring it.
Their trust in this process leads them to advocate the use of implementations whose code would facilitate 2mb blocks.
There are however those who demonise trust in the Nakamoto consensus and assert that allowing Bitcoin to govern itself, as per it's design, would be disastrous.
Furthermore they insist that, in absence of allowing bitcoins fundamental consensus mechanic to function, we must reach consensus by fiat (decree of authority) passed down by a group of men small enough to fit around a single boardroom table.
In conclusion, the likes of coinbase, Xapo, and Gavin are not trying to control Bitcoin, they simply believe in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-23 00:41:59
Perhaps mining at a loss, on a massively distributed scale.
Imagine the 21 business model of in-device mining but without the utter bullshit of claiming that it can be of direct benefit to the user.
Call them "charity boxes". Plug them in, they suck £10/month of electricity and you get to choose which pool controlled by a charity receives the benefit of your hashing.
I'd get to contribute £10 worth of hashing to securing the Bitcoin network whilst also making a donation to the RNLI.

Cores habit of poor communication stemmed from a lack of necessity brought about by the temporary notion of a "default" Bitcoin implementation.
A small clique of core developers would talk amongst themselves, decide upon a course of action, then release their latest version of Bitcoin.
Their version, their course of action, was thus being adopted on the basis of momentum, not merit. They saw no need to focus on communication outside of their group as they saw themselves as the deciding entity.
However, the upcoming 2MB hard fork will finally illustrate that, as per bitcoins fundamental design, it is the functional and economic majority that decides the course, not any particular group of devs.
This is when their communication will be forced to improve. As the notion of a "default" implementation is dismissed, bitcoins opensource nature is allowed to thrive. The debate moves from the distraction of keeping people using core/stopping people using classic and matures into the advocacy of features and improvements to the protocol itself.

To make it 100x more expensive to do this we can either have a basic fee of $3.00 per transaction or raise the block size to 50mb and have $0.06 transactions.
It is so blindingly obvious that we need larger blocks that I'm genuinely more concerned by the devs inaction rather then this "spam" attack.
@_date: 2016-02-23 22:02:09
The answer is Bitcoin.
The basic technological breakthrough of Bitcoin isn't any particular example of code, but rather the structure of incentives. The result being any change to Bitcoin requiring a combination of functional and economic majority (miners, nodes, businesses, services, users etc) of the Bitcoin system.
This "Nakamoto consensus" means that to change Bitcoin you must BE Bitcoin. To increase the money supply a party must first comprise the very same individuals that would be most harmed by such a change.
Bitcoin can be forked at anytime, by anyone, and for any reason. The process of agreeing a hardfork is precisely the same as defending against one. Only changes that the Bitcoin system believes to be beneficial will occur.
There are however those who demonise trust in the Nakamoto consensus and assert that allowing Bitcoin to govern itself, as per it's design, would be disastrous.
Furthermore they insist that, in absence of allowing bitcoins fundamental consensus mechanic to function, we must reach consensus by fiat (decree of authority) passed down by a group of men small enough to fit around a single boardroom table.
That is the very same political scenario Bitcoin was created to obviate, as in time I trust it will.
Edit: Expanded explanation of role of hardforks.
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:52:14
The number of names is largely irrelevant in the context of who calls the shots at "core", any suggestion that they all share equal influence would be VERY incorrect.
The simple reality is that with only a single reference implementation a very small group of self appointed "authority" figures, consisting mostly of blockstream employees, gets to decide bitcoins path.
With competing reference implementations then the economic and functional majority of the Bitcoin system (miners, nodes, exchanges, businesses, services, holders, users, etc) will decide bitcoins path.
As per the design.

Massively distributed mining via millions of 21 chips or similar is an interesting concept, but to date no one has articulated a single example of loss making in-device Bitcoin mining being the most efficient and elegant solution to a consumer problem.
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:43:00
The fastest, cheapest, most efficient use of LN is everyone having one payment channel to a single monolithic payment hub (likely run by blockstream/their investors such as AXA).
Without raising the on-chain transactional capacity fees will by necessity have to rise to $100 and more to provide proportionally adequate security for an expanded Bitcoin economy.
This further exacerbates centralisation as people will want to open as few payment channels as possible as they are damn expensive. The need to lock funds into channels means only well funded institutions will be able to fulfil the role of these monolithic hubs.
There is a clear and dangerous reason that blockstream are fighting tooth and nail to divert Bitcoin from its original path of on chain growth and peer to peer cash.
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:09:18
Perhaps more specifically, they couldn't even if they wanted to.
Bitcoin does not have the capacity, there are a mindblowing range of uses for blockchain technology but it increasingly looks like they will occur on a different chain.

An increasingly expensive, artificially restricted, small block settlement system IS the redesign!
Until very recently the number of transactions relative to block size meant the status quo was to effectively have no limit. If there were more transactions the blocksize grew to accommodate them.
This attempt to repurpose Bitcoin towards their own corporatist design, effectively excluding individuals from the blockchain, and trying to paint decentralised development as a danger rather than bitcoins primary defense against political capture is very revealing.
@_date: 2015-04-09 09:23:05
You are displaying a distinct lack of both technical and economic understanding by failing to understand that bitcoins current initial model is not its final intended model.
 Putting aside the necessity of decentralised distribution of Bitcoin, the block reward is absolutly needed at this stage to incentivise the securing of the system. 
 Transaction fees will be absolutly sufficient at the intended future time when Bitcoin is handling thousands of transactions per second. To imply we should instantly arrive at that stage is technically impossible and logically absurd.

We need the world to need Bitcoin.
I remember when it all first clicked for me, the moment I realised that this was more than just money, that Bitcoin is programmable transactions.
As many people have said over these short exciting years "money is just the first app".
All these imagined and as yet unimagined technologies and services will use blockchain, and a blockchain that has the capacity to facilitate them all will emerge dominant as the path of least resistance for it makes far more economic and technical sense to use the single most secure chain than a multitude of vunerable individual chains.
We need that blockchain to be Bitcoin.
Think how many times we heard "litecoin will be silver to bitcoins gold" only for that notion to be swiftly and rightly shot down. Bitcoin is divisible, if a chain is handling large value transactions it can also handle the low value transactions by using smaller units.
A simple concept.
Yet, here we have the small blockers actively working to freeze the capacity of Bitcoin and restrict the ability to transact. In an incredibly arrogant fashion they wave their hands and declare that all the other uses of blockchain, the vast multitude of transactions that will dwarf bitcoins will be done elsewhere on some other chain. 
They believe Bitcoin will be left alone as a purely high value settlement system....
... Bitcoin as gold to litecoins silver.
@_date: 2015-09-15 00:40:25
The node reduction had nothing to do with the blocksize though.
It was the simple and clearly predicted result of wallet development. Bitcoin was not designed for every user to run a node, as soon as lite wallets were available they were adopted by the majority of users as expected.
The people who run nodes now and in the future, such as myself, are  individuals or businesses with the incentives and entirely modest resources needed to have a spare harddrive and sufficient Internet connection.
With the wider adoption afforded by larger blocks, node count will undoubtedly increase.

We don't need to grow overnight to compete with visa, we simply need to be able to grow as we have. 10Gbps unlimited up and down connections are already being trialed for residential use. Think 5-10 years from now and those same businesses and individuals could easily be handling 30GB+ blocks.

Which means an attacker could, step by step, march the fees paid by "genuine" tranasactions ever higher while their tranasactions get dropped.

Bursts of activity will naturally occur for very straightforward reasons.

However, no matter the device or amount of btc need for functionality, be it low level Satoshis for smart contracts or mid level for a tv purchasing some content, how is mining Bitcoin in device a cheaper, faster and more elegant solution than just sending Bitcoin to the device for it to use?
Remember, Bitcoin transactions are easy. In tho IoT future a standard wallet could have a "load my devices" button, press it once a month and job done.
Dedicated in device mining hardware is just a very expensive and cumbersome way to accomplish what Bitcoin can already do so very well, move Bitcoin.

This. As it is intended to be.
I genuinely believe that the Nakamoto consensus, the key innovation at the heart of decentralised blockchains, actually functions.
The permissionless, utterly unrestrained ability to fork Bitcoin is a foundational principle and its primary means of defense against political capture.
If for any reason such as bribery, violent coercion, or simply disagreement, Bitcoin development should be crippled or diverted down a harmful path then there is nothing to stop the economic and functional system majority from forking and thus routing around the damage.
Bitcoin was designed in full recognition that as it grows there will emerge an abundance of often entirely contrary teams of devs who all envision themselves as stewards or saviours of the system via their particular pet theories and projects, as well as nefarious entities with ill intent such as certain nation states and legacy financial institutions.
In reality Bitcoin devs are readily replaceable, all of them, with only the ability to fulfil bitcoins desires and never the power to dictate them.
Developers remain at Liberty to present code to Bitcoin and ask "is this what you want?" but can not declare "this is what you're getting".
@_date: 2015-11-17 19:54:01
But it costs you more in electricity to mine the Bitcoin than the resulting value you attain.
Why not just save money and time by spending the Bitcoin directly?
If the answer is "well what if Bitcoin is hard to get in the first place?" then I'd ask how that could possibly be the case in a world where Bitcoin is so pervasive that the likes of Samsung, Sony and other major companies are putting Bitcoin miners directly into their consumer devices?

@_date: 2016-10-10 12:22:26
Perhaps for different reasons, I share the same hope.
In order to more firmly establish trust in Bitcoin it would be good to take this opportunity to show that the functional and economic majority of Bitcoin is indeed capable of routing around obstructions.
@_date: 2015-11-18 01:05:45
There is one thing that Bitcoin most certainly excels at: moving Bitcoin.
Contrary to what you have just claimed, 21s clearly stated and widely reported intention is to have their mining chips built into all devices, from phones to TVs and routers, anything that can conceivably utilise Bitcoin.
They claim that in-device mining is their solution to the problem of "how do we move x amount of Bitcoin to a particular device for it to utilise?" when clearly the cheapest, fastest and most elegant solution to the "problem" of moving Bitcoin is "sending" Bitcoin.
It's what Bitcoin does, ffs.
@_date: 2015-11-30 15:40:19
No, BIP 101 is only ever activated once 75% of miners adopt it, before that it completely adheres to the concensus fork.
It has been very specifically designed so that adopting BIP 101 is the only way to ensure you are never on the minority fork.
@_date: 2015-09-02 07:52:59
At anything above $0.05 per transaction as the average expected fee then, at a minimum, Bitcoin embraces a larger block fork or it simply gets replaced by an alt such as litecoin.
As Bitcoin appreciates in value the amount needed to incentivise adequate security will also increase making the above situation ever more acute.
The blockstream developers need to come to terms with the reality that their product will not exist in isolation nor be free of market forces.
This is why the original vision of Bitcoin, that of wide-scale adoption, massive transaction capability, and low fees, requires larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:40:56
Why on earth would a phone need to slowly and expensively mine dust in order to perform Bitcoin transactions?
 In device mining is already obsolete as a concept. It's becoming increasingly clear that 21 backed themselves into a corner with this mining chip obsession and they will either pivot or fail as a company.
Ditch the mining chip, flog the 21 computer for 1/4 of the price would be a sensible start.

It doesn't even need preloading, a "load my devices" button would be basic functionality on a standard wallet. These devices are all talking together via your network so they can be automatically topped up to minimum levels.
Some people say the in device mining is because Bitcoin is hard to acquire for some people but the success scenario for the 21 chip is a world where your devices from TVs to routers all have Bitcoin transacting ability. Bitcoin is genuinely being pissed into the ether left, right and centre. It's a world where Bitcoin clearly flows freely without being constantly converted into fiat.
Their required success scenario doesn't require in device mining.
Sending btc to the device, either before or after purchase, remains in all cases a cheaper, faster and more elegant solution.
@_date: 2015-11-17 23:22:52
You simply top it up with some Bitcoin from your phone.

Because of how Bitcoin works on a fundamental level, the proceeds of mining do not increase with the number of miners, the proceeds will only get spread thinner.
Massively distributed Bitcoin mining simply can not fund any economically significant activity.

I decided I wanted to test coinbase the other day and I have to say it was frustrating.
 I was using their app on my iPad which it turns out cuts off the "continue" button at the bottom of the screen. I was photographing my ID and nothing was happening, keep doing it thinking perhaps it wasn't sharp enough or something. Next thing I know I've used up all my tries and am locked out for 24 hours!
 The following day I used my phone and deduced the problem, got verified and tried to buy, turns out there is a fixed limit of £40 for daily instant buys from debit cards. 
As I prefer to buy whole coins I explored linking my bank account. Coinbase asks me to send a small amount to verify the details and it might take a few days, I go to send £1 via SEPA to coinbases Estonian bank account (Estonia, really?) for which lloyds will charge me £10!
Balls to that.
The localbitcoin rate is only £10 above coinbase, I get the coins in 10 minutes on average and I don't have to compromise my security by providing a slew of private information and photo ID.
It seems ridiculous that some complete stranger via localbitcoins can provide a faster, smoother and far more secure online service than coinbase but it is absolutly true.

The only way I can think of making a pointless product like this viable is to make losing money be the actual point of it.
Call it a "charity box". 
You plug it in, select the independently run pool of your chosen charity (trezor like on device confirmation required to thwart hackers), and then ignore it as it uses roughly $10 a month of electricity securing the Bitcoin network.
Your "loss" turns into a donation stream for good causes. One million people worldwide happily mining at a $10 "loss" each month sounds like healthy competition to large miners who have to make a profit.
Edit: it would be vital that mining was its only functionality, we would only want users who were entirely aware of its sole purpose as they would be more informed with regards to changing pools periodically for various reasons.
@_date: 2015-11-17 18:58:09
Your examples sound cool... but unless I'm missing something, none of them require the mining chip.
It's like having a coffee percolator that produces 1ml of coffee an hour built directly into the new iMac. Sure, people love coffee and devs certainly require it, but there are just far cheaper, faster and more elegant ways to aquire it.
To be clear I'm not knocking you or the cool stuff you're doing with 21's hardware, I'm just trying to understand the in-device mining angle.
@_date: 2015-03-19 13:15:13
It's not ridiculous, it's just economics. The higher price incentivises others to enter the market to satisfy demand as competition simultaneously begins to drives down prices.

It's the idea of in-device mining itself that many are still struggling to see the utility in.
Future versions of these chips are intended to be embedded into consumer devices, to become a new kind of system resource. 
However, the success of this idea seems predicated upon a future where Bitcoin is "hard" to obtain, where Bitcoin is not used as money, where no one gets paid in Bitcoin, where no one but digital content providers trade in Bitcoin, and ultimately where most human beings don't know how to send a Bitcoin transaction.
The moment someone realises they can push the "load my devices" button on their Bitcoin wallet is the moment the relatively expensive in-device mining is made obsolete.
I adamantly believe that Bitcoin will succeed and become a widely, if not the most widely, used form of money.
In that successful future, in-device mining is DOA as people will have and use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-16 17:40:40
None of which requires a mining chip.
Sure, let's imagine an IoT world with almost all devices having built in wallets transacting with each other. Pressing a button on my phone and loading all my devices with an amount of Bitcoin will always be more efficient than in device mining.
Not a single use that they have proposed requires in device mining. They are either unable or unwilling to articulate why a device needs a mining chip.
@_date: 2015-11-17 02:14:58
It's almost exclusively people criticising the inclusion of in-device mining. I've yet to see anyone present a use case where simply transferring some Bitcoin to the device isn't a cheaper, faster and more elegant solution.
The nonsensical mining chip seems to be a needless distraction from what otherwise could be an interesting and more accessibly priced piece of kit.

There has been no particular incentive to mine XT blocks.
With the major exchanges and services voicing their support for an imminent switchover, the incentive for miners will be whether they want to be able to sell their bitcoins or not.
This is one of the key checks/balances at work, it's all about the application of incentives. The miners will follow the BIP 101 fork as it is widely acknowledged that a larger blocksize will result in increased utility, displays bitcoins ability to adapt to challenges and indicates an ability to survive over the longterm.
This all means a higher perception of bitcoins value, so the miners will switch.

I've also not seen anyone yet point out that the proceeds from mining is a strictly limited pie to be distributed to all these devices, putting a very real hard cap on the possible economic activity the "mining to pay for X" system could support.
Look at the daily mining proceeds, divide it by 10,000,000 or more of these in-device mining chips. Even at $10,000 bitcoins there isn't enough to go around to support mining to pay for services.

This is exactly what I've been trying to get through to people the last couple of days.
21 did not have a meeting and ask the question "In an Internet of things future, how do we move Bitcoin onto transaction capable devices?" ... because the answer is clear, just send the device some Bitcoin. Moving Bitcoin is what Bitcoin does best.
The question 21 are trying to answer is "how do we get OUR mining chips embedded into consumer devices the world over?"... and the answer to that is a marketing solution.
A lot of people are falling for their marketing.

A Bitcoin that doesn't solve the fugibility issue is a Bitcoin that won't continue to exist in the longterm.
However I am fully confident a software solution will emerge, a number of promising examples are already underway. Tiny scale in-device mining itself, due to the clear technical limitations, could only obfusticate a minuscule amount of a person's economic activity anyway. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:11:17
Pushing a "load my devices" button on your wallet is far more convenient, from every perspective, than having to labour 10x longer than the cost of the base btc amount in order to pay for the electricity to facilitate the in-device mining.

That didn't happen.
Their hashrate actually increased by a small amount.

I disagree, raising the block limit will alleviate the problem of incentive for full nodes.
Larger blocks allows lower transaction fees while maintaining sufficient block reward. These lower fees allow far greater utility for the Bitcoin blockchain beyond simply an expensive monetary settlement system.
What is needed is countless wonderful fucking capitalists providing a multitude of Bitcoin blockchain based products and services whose business model benifits from them each running a full node.
That's the incentive.
No convoluted node monetisation tech is required, just for core devs to get their foot off bitcoins neck.
@_date: 2015-11-17 18:27:16
For which there is no technical requirement for the mining chip.
Every positive use case for this machine and the products and services that emerge from it do not technically require the mining chip.
The only stated use of the mining functionality is to aquire small amounts of Bitcoin for dev purposes.
Bitcoin developers are intelligent enough to discover a means of acquiring Bitcoin without personally mining it.
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:59:34
I already regularly recieve Bitcoin for the goods I produce, this will only become more common place assuming Bitcoin does not collapse.
 Why would I pay x times the cost of the resulting BTC amount, produced through in-device mining, via my electricity bill when I can simply load all my devices at once or even keep them "fuelled" on a continuous basis through additional functionality in my standard Bitcoin wallet?
A world where every device utilises Bitcoin can not functionally be a world where Bitcoin is difficult to acquire.
In device mining is nonsensical and nothing they have presented challenges this.

 View Bitcoin as an all or nothing bet. If it fails it will be worthless, if it succeeds then functional necessity will put the price of one Bitcoin at well in excess of $100,000.
You don't have to risk large amounts of money to potentially see massive returns.
A vast and growing industry of people far smarter, skilled, connected and well resourced than you or I are actively building the businesses and infrastructure to make Bitcoin a success. By holding part of the underlying asset their efforts will directly benefit your investment.

 Beyond price, beyond wider adoption, beyond fucking Amazon, the most pressing issue within Bitcoin is to establish straightforward and routine methods of effective anonymity.

There is no way to say this without sounding arrogant, but when you grasp the big picture it all becomes clear.
Bitcoin is a financial instrument that challenges not one aspect but all aspects of global finance. Success in one area inevitably breeds success in others.
For example if it becomes a widely used tool for international remittance the functionally necessary increase in value makes it almost inconceivable to think that it would not also become a popular store of value. Where would you rather have your savings in such a world? Tied to banks in the sinking Euro monetary union or tied to the notion that people will still want to send money round the world?
If Bitcoin is a dominant means of international remittance and store of value why wouldn't I accept it in my shop? It's easier than credit cards and cheaper than cash.
If Bitcoin succeeds at all then it will succeed completely.
Again, I know this sounds unbearably arrogant but look at the big picture, see how everything gets connected by Bitcoin.
It's all or nothing, truly.

I don't think its a deflationary effect at play, simply that people aren't understanding that merchant adoption doesn't increase demand.
 The average consumer would be an idiot to use fiat to buy Bitcoin to spend when they could just spend the fiat to begin with.
What drives demand is use cases where Bitcoin is the only or vastly better option, innovations like the Silk Road and its technological advancement through openbazaar are examples of this.
I'm a supporter and holder of Bitcoin but I'll only be buying my groceries with it in future as a side effect, not a cause, of its success.

As already mentioned, hardware wallets are the answer. Not only will they allow for easy access cold storage but will finally bring about secure authorisation for all online sevices. 
Bitcoin will finally bring about idiot proof security for the Internet.

That's an incorrect use of both capital letters and the word "maximum", they simply change the arbitrary limit that was only imposed to stop spam in the early days.

... and the enormous on-chain tx fees that would be needed under a small block/Lightning network system to adequately secure Bitcoin, economically incentivises these PayPal 2.0 style hubs.

To be used as a major currency or to achieve success in any of its intended markets Bitcoin must, due to simple functional necessity, have a value above $100,000.
 If you think the monetary base of Bitcoin can go from $0 to multiple $trillions instantly or even in a straight line then you are a dumbass.
A big fucking dumbass.
Large volatility at this early stage is not only needed but absolutely expected.

 This is beyond dumb to the point of actually seeming quite insidious. 
 They are actually advocating that individuals be priced out of the blockchain and forced to ask permission from a cartel of large and easily regulated financial institutions (banks) to use "their" network.
It's an attempt to maintain the status quo. 
The block size MUST increase, as was always the intention.

The way you've worded that might create an unclear impression of how market value is reached.
Google and Apple combined are worth more than $1Trillion but no collapse in the dollar or even a remotely comparable shift from the dollar into those companies shares was required.
$100,000 btc isn't actually an outlandish notion, no financial collapse or global domination is required, just reasonable continued growth.

The issue is that he defines spam as services that run contrary to his religious beliefs, such as Bitcoin gambling.
He is a menace to bitcoins core principles.

Yet again they repeat the demonstrably false assertion that Bitcoin is somehow seperate form the blockchain.
 Either they fundamentally do not understand that the blockchain is just a record of Bitcoin transactions or they are purposely trying to decieve their audience.
"...many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it."
Always nice to finish on a cliché.

No choice at all as "comply or be destroyed" isn't a choice.
Without compliant businesses like coinbase Bitcoin would have no where near the value it currently does. They are the major on ramps and without them the majority of bitcoins speculative value would evaporate.
The simple reality is that we need compliant companies in order to reach the stage where we no longer need them.

You cannot force a financial obligation upon someone else.
Chains can be forked at anytime, by anyone, for any reason. This is a foundational principle and unavoidable reality of decentralised software.
If I fork Bitcoin tomorrow it does not obligate coinbase to expend valuable resources to support my minority chain. If I convince a buddy who runs a competing exchange to list my new version of Bitcoin then the situation remains unchanged, coinbase is under no obligation to expend resources to support it.
A theoretically infinite number of minority chains is possible, no one is obligated to support them.

A significant factor is that almost 100% of ethereums day to day economic activity is speculative trading. Without the existence of even a nascent supporting economy, speculation is running wild.

The price is dictated by supply and demand, and merchant adoption does not itself increase demand.
The main players behind price rises, the speculative investors, are perfectly aware of this and so while they welcome merchant adoption it doesn't sway their decision to buy more.
 They, and thus the price rise we all hope for, is currently waiting on developments that may increase demand such as...
Breakthrough developments in international remittance, ETF announcement, Bank bail ins, The next reward halving, Clear evidence of Business to Business growth
... and a multitude of other things, but not merchant adoption which again does not directly increase demand or price, it's the speculative investors we must look to.

 "Satoshi could single-handedly tank the price without warning."
You're not understanding. All that someone who controls vast amounts of Bitcoin can actually do is relinquish control of that same bitcoin.
That's it.
Sure, it will make waves, perhaps in Satoshis case big ones, but they will die down and the problem is gone and the system adjusts, recovers and prospers.
In the fiat system nothing is stopping wave after wave after wave of new money being printed out of thin air until the whole system collapses.

You are making the claim that a fork by a mere 6% would result in chaos? Do you honestly believe that Bitcoin can succeed if that were even remotely accurate?
Ethereum has essentially no use nor economic activity beyond speculative investment at this time. What we are seeing in their fork is a volatile flurry of speculative price action. Bitcoin, due not only to its current economic development but also fundamental differences in its design, would not behave in the same way when a fork occurs.

When I first got into Bitcoin I rationalised that I'd either see Bitcoin hit $0 or $100,000+.
I made the decision that once half my stash could buy me a house with land then I'd buy that and let the rest ride.

No. Absolutely not.
This isn't an insult, it's just the reality.
Bitcoin is so young, so relatively unimportant for the time being that the best developers in the nascent Bitcoin space are simply those developers who happened to get involved early.
Like video games developers in the early 1950's/60's/70's, the "best video games developers in the world" not because they were the greatest creative minds of their age, they were just the dudes who made games.
Just don't conflate "the first" with "the best".
Bitcoin is growing, it will draw in enormous amounts of interest and talent, and a lot of prominent names will fade away.

There is no way to say this without sounding arrogant, but when you grasp the big picture it all becomes clear.
 Bitcoin is a financial instrument that challenges not one aspect but all aspects of global finance. Success in one area inevitably breeds success in others.
 For example if it becomes a widely used tool for international remittance the functionally necessary increase in value makes it  almost inconceivable to think that it would not also become a popular store of value. Where would you rather have your savings in such a world? Tied to banks in the sinking Euro monetary union or tied to the notion that people will still want to send money round the world?
If Bitcoin is a dominant means of international remittance and store of value why wouldn't I accept it in my shop? It's easier than credit cards and cheaper than cash.
If Bitcoin succeeds at all then it will succeed completely. 
Again, I know this sounds unbearably arrogant but look at the big picture, see how everything gets connected by Bitcoin.

Bitcoin only succeeds if people are at Liberty to do whatever the fuck they like with it, that includes exchanging it at times and in quantities that other people may disapprove of.
What you call a separate world of unregulated manipulation is just them using Bitcoin in a way you personally dislike. 
Tough titties.
I am however confident that as the market grows such price swings will reduce in severity as past and current information indicates.

Clearly stated, this is the most obvious solution.
If one master is simply swapped for another the situation is not resolved, we will have merely switched the voices of dissent.
Remove the role of master though, and allow people to pick and choose their own personal moderators, and you finally have the ability to satisfy everyone.
Except of course for those whose specific goal and desire is to dictate the information that other people may freely choose to see.
Let them object openly, it would be good to recognise them.
