I think this sums up the bitcoin community perfectly.

No, Airbnb like every other company on the planet likes transaction speed, reduced fraud, strong liability, and ease of use. Bitcoin sucks at all those things.
Comments like this just show how out of touch with reality the bitcoin community is.

One of the narratives is that he being extorted by a hacker that learned of his identity a few years ago and is dangerous (not just a bedroom hacker). It's unknown what this hacker wants but has threatened his friends and family and is forcing him onto the public stage.  
Why a public stage, well the hacker cannot gain any leverage for exposing him if he has exposed himself. But it would be a genius move if he exposed himself and led people to believe he was a scammer, when in fact he is not. Some of the evidence seems to support this very fact.

I think you meant this,   
I somehow suspect this "exceptional group" will have researched their way to a huge cock size.

Facts are more important than reddit opinions.
Since CO1N is legitimately on the top500 it is not imaginary. Since the top500 refuses to comment on the specifics of Tulip Trading one can only conclude that;
1. Top500 is legally bound to not disclose anything.  
2. The real owners of Tulip for some reason are staying quite. 
3. The Top500 has been comprised 
Option  makes the most logical sense due to the nature of competitive supercomputers amongst industry and government agencies.      
Also if you watch CW's supercomputer lessons on on youtube  he makes several references to the computer and other people using it, so clearly some of these "other people" have more information. Have any of his students said anything about being able to access it, as far as I can tell, no.  But he does talk at length about it, including finding more funding for the electricity bills for 5 more years.

True but there are several narratives here, as said the reddit view is way to simplistic. The first narrative was due to hackers leaking documents to the media and gwern.  The second round was portrayed as "setting the record straight" due to the shitstorm of the first outing. Or the alternative theory presented by I.Grigg that he is being extorted. 
Whatever the case there is a lot of disinformation and fuckery going back several years that needs to be looked at more analytically and even forensically, instead of basing opinion on kneejerk reddit responses.

They can still make a judgement call, as said they don't live in a bubble. If you ran GMX and knew the story behind the account name you would also probably close it.

Tulip Trust refers to the comparison of Bitcoins to tulipmania and the "parable of the broken window" .
I will copy and paste what it actually refers to since apparently people in here can't Google.
1.  "The famous tulipmania, which saw the reported prices of several breeds of tulip bulbs rise to above the value of a furnished luxury house in 17th century Amsterdam, was an artifact created by an implicit conversion of ordinary futures contracts into option contracts in an imperfectly successful attempt by Dutch futures buyers and public officials to bail themselves out of previously incurred speculative losses in the impressively price-efficient, fundamentally driven, market for Dutch tulip contracts. There was thus nothing maniacal about prices in this period. Despite outward appearances, the tulipmania was not a bubble because bubbles require the existence of mutually-agreed-upon prices that exceed fundamental values. The “tulipmania” was simply a period during which the prices in futures contracts had been legally, albeit temporarily, converted into options exercise prices"

This kinda silly, private blockchains can certainly help with existence proof, paper-trail, auditing and signing history both in-house and with partners/suppliers/etc. It's not sexy but current auditing is massively time consuming, easy to fraud and expensive.

Watch his supercomputer video lessons on youtube, read some of his books and info sec posts. He isn't exactly dumb.
@_date: 2016-05-08 16:29:07
There are a lot of people shouting "he is a fraud because it's easy to publicly prove himself" including the inane mic drop moment by This is counter to  the logical reality that he does not want to publicly prove anything, in fact if you listen to him he wants to avoid this at all costs.
  
I don't know why the bitcoin yachtsmen of the world think he owes them proof.
  
I am in no way defending CW, but the herd mentality of him owing the public a personified proof is wrong.
@_date: 2016-05-09 00:47:53
I'm not sure because we are missing the components that go with the video, namely the online/email course and forum instructions/feedback.
CW's style is very aloof, at any rate it's an actual course where the students had goals and he was involved with grading it. It would be great to hear from one of them. A dumb person doesn't know the first thing about rock clusters, or supercomputer at all, and some of the difficulties he mentions are spot on. There are not many people who can claim to know about the hurdles of super clusters from different manufacturers and this is certainly outside what I know about.
Several of his info sec posts speak with the same language of a security auditor, though again it's very academic and his style can be difficult to understand and often vague.    
I'm not saying he's a genius, but to say he is dumb is ridiculous.

Ya that exactly what credit cards were invented for, what an amazing point.

Not really, it's very VERY expensive to do this currently and outside the scope of most medium/large companies. Even large companies that have this stuff in place have a difficult time dealing with proprietary systems, and cross channel is practically impossible. 
There is nothing wrong with private company having checks and balances that are more efficiently build with a blockchain API and to be honest your opinion on the matter is useless, it's up to them to decide if this tech makes economic sense.
I can give you a concrete example if this is something you need to understand further and why it is zero threat to BC or public ledgers.

SGI themselves said he could have purchased it on the grey market which does happen often. There are valid reasons why it this would be the case, namely that did he not want to be bound by any additionals contracts, wanted to maintain secrecy,  and he was hacking around inside the hardware which would invalid any warranties. Also on the top500 it lists Supermicro and not SGI for Tulip.  
The letter makes this whole thing strange, and now that link is dead.    
So far all of the is circumstantial bullshit, the real proof would be the top500.com validating the computer and technique used to qualify, but they have refused to comment. 
Thus the only valid proof would be from top500.com themselves, outside someone actually physically verifying the computer and CW.  So the conclusion can so far only be with regards to top500, 
1. They are legally bound to stay quite.     
2. Their list was hacked    
3. Tulip is someone else and for some reason they are saying nothing.     
4. They were able to falsify information to top500    
Also note in the video linked by that someone congratulates CW on his rank and he says "Actually wanted to get it a bit higher but the bloody NSA came in with 2 new servers  , I don't know what the hell they are doing but..  "
And to add more confusion, here is CW thanking SGI in the start of the video

The evidence so far certainly does not support this. Pipe dreams and all..
