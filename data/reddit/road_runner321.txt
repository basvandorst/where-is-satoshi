I remember this happening with the Occupy movement. The whole premise precluded anyone from taking even a guiding position, let alone a leadership role. Those in the movement took pride in having no hierarchy and being decentralized, fueled purely by public feeling. And that was great, while everyone was feeling the same power of emotion and they all wanted the same thing, however nebulously that thing was defined; but when it came down to brass tacks and fine details, the group couldn't cohere.
Fast forward to now, and Bitcoin has gotten over the original excitement that drove it, and must now prove its utility to a wider, less savvy audience that has to have the benefits spelled out for them and no longer gets pumped by a giddy, enigmatic "Just you wait..." Bitcoin needs to define itself-- No, *people* with a voice and a public outlet need to define Bitcoin, and set extremely specific goals for the future, and not just "It's the Internet of money" or "Everyone will use this when they see its potential" buzz phrases. Somebody needs to be in charge, not of the Bitcoin, but of the message.
Don't let Bitcoin end up like Occupy, whose tombstone should have the quotation, "Take care that you don't mistake movement for action."

Mt. Gox is how I got started with bitcoin. Then I started feeling worried about having all my funds in one place, so I moved them around. Then they stopped converting through Dwolla so I moved nearly everything out. I got my last few coins out about a week before it sank. 
I wasn't smart, I was lucky.
Mt. Gox is a cautionary tale to never trust all of your assets with one entity. Mt. Gox did not disprove the concept of bitcoin; the underlying theory is sound and expanding every day. I have no reason to be bitter, but even if I had lost money, I think I would see past it to a brighter future.

When you scan a credit card, you are giving the merchant your account information. Then they access your account and "pull" the required amount of money out. If this information is saved or intercepted it would allow another person to charge your account.
When you use bitcoins, the merchant has an account (wallet address) that you scan and you "push" the required amount into that address. If this information is intercepted it only shows the amount, the time, the wallet it came from, and the wallet it went to, and nothing else. No private information is shared that would allow a thief to access your funds; the wallet addresses are public and cannot be used to pull money out.

I saw Bitcoin back in December 2011, but I was broke. Later I was able to scrounge some together at an average price of about $60 each. It's been a wild ride since then. But I am not economically savvy, so this was just a goof on my part. I am lucky, but you have to take a risk to get lucky in the first place.
I told my family in summer 2013 that I had invested in Bitcoin and explained the basic premise over dinner at a pizza place. Dubious looks around the table. Now my sister has asked me if she should buy some. My dad has asked me to sell him one or a half.
I didn't make an informed decision; I got in on something that seemed innovative, revolutionary, and trending upward. I am a lucky idiot, but I think even the regret of an unlucky idiot would feel better than the regret of missing out.

When the price rises it's not just the actual price, but the price + the enthusiasm of the buyers fueling the uptrend. This pushes the overall price higher. At a certain point the price peaks, enthusiasm gives way to caution, and the price dips back down to the actual value.

Maybe Andreas has spoiled me. Now I expect as much energy, intelligence, and erudition from all blockchain speakers.
The speakers kept mentioning the fact that blockchain is a great application for proof-of-ownership, money, voting, data storage, notarizing, etc... but they never really explained in detail how the blockchain works. One guy mentioned that it got rid of intermediaries, but didn't explain how; he said it prevents the double-spend problem, but didn't explain how; he mentioned the white paper, but only so far as the phrase "peer-to-peer" in the title. Nothing in all the talks about how the blockchain actually works, how it is secured against forgery, or what incentives are given to people to help secure the blockchain. Just "The blockchain is awesome (for some reason)".
I liked all the applications, but it felt like they didn't give enough of a foundation to build on.

You can create your own Bitcoin bank insofar as you can offer to hold yours and other people's money. But everyone else can hold their own money, so it's kinda redundant. The "money" is only the proof that you control a part of the blockchain. If you give that control to somebody else then it's not your money anymore.
As a currency, you control a portion of the blockchain, a world wide ledger that anyone can view, and which is maintained by every person using the blockchain. Paper money is a way of keeping track of who holds a certain amount of debt, which gives the paper value. With bitcoin, money is the information stored on the blockchain, and the trading of control of this information is how the money is used to buy things.
The free market determines value. And what is valuable on the internet? The ability to send something securely, instantly, and without the risk of it being lost, intercepted, or forged. Bitcoin is backed by its utility and security.
