Guys I found Logan Paul.

Is it cheaper? Are their less fees?

Is there any sort of fee if I was to/any sort of downside if I was to buy on Coinbase and then transfer my BTC to my wallet on Coinsquare.io to get around the premium you mentioned?

Brilliant. I’m so intrigued by all of this (so thanks for sharing)! That note on getting past immigration with a BTC wallet is such a great thought that never crossed my mind even as someone who travels a lot. Can I ask you a few questions? 1. Is there a downside to being payed in Bitcoin that you’ve experienced thus far? Has it affected the way you view finances (since it’s such an integral part of your livelyhood).? If you have an opinion, what are some of the most important things to know about Crypto from your POV? 
I had more important questions but I forgot them by the time I got the

That’s nuts! So what you’re telling me is go to GDAX immediately.

Literally just got fucked for doing this. Woke up and seeing it lose value more and more...

As a newbie to BTC and Cryptocurrency in general can you please explain your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:07:59
You’re the reason the market went back up, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:33:27
Where do you recommend starting with a wallet outside Coinbase or GDAX? Aside from a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:28:23
Wow that was fast, and wow that makes a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:30:55
Wait wait why? This is the first I’ve ever heard this. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:27:27
May I ask what kind of employer is paying people in BTC? I’m intrigued!
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:14:54
Did you ever find out if GDAX let’s you withdraw CAD?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:02:42
Is this in reference to fees when withdrawing BTC or CAD funds? Sorry I feel like I should be able to understand what you meant... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:22:33
So if I place a take order on GDAX, it will be cheaper for me than placing a take order on Coinbase because of the difference between the  .25% and 4% fees? Why ever use Coinbase then?

Thanks for taking the time to share all this with me. Best of luck in the future and I appreciate the personal Iceland story!
