Don't send mine until I send you an address.  My payments were sent directly from mtred.

I've got a couple of decent ideas, but I need web programmers to help me put up sites, basically with speculation as wages.
@_date: 2011-07-19 23:12:49
That's a decision for investors.  
Here's the other side: 
If people buy a $130.00  card that they otherwise wouldn't have considered, just for mining, and BTC fails tomorrow, they lost $130.00 and *might* be able to recoup their costs, minus electricity, and shipping, by selling on ebay.

I appreciate your response.  Will you let me buy one board and 1 card for a review?
A review could do good for your product - I'd show its reality and its capabilities, how easily it can be set up, how well it shipped, and how easily someone can get support.

I really don't want just a handful of huge investors.
As I said before:  If you lose $3.00, you'll be angry at me for losing your hamburger. If you lose $100.00, we're talking about whether you can afford your car payment.

I'm as concerned as any other redditor about doc-dropping and personal harassment.
I'm willing to provide personal details to the mtred admins or to highbeamhater if they are willing to verify as a  proxy, or to the iama mods if that will be sufficient.
@_date: 2011-06-27 01:05:16
actually, not.   the color scheme fades to black far too rapidly.  it's hard to read.  Is it so wrong to want to see trades older than 15 minutes.
@_date: 2011-06-28 20:34:47
they have to *look* polished.  
the back-ends of payment sites are kludged together all the time with  mysterious (to the end customer)   card acceptance, payment &amp; address verification, and other software.  I daresay that average Bob is probably oblivious to the names and identities  at least 70% of the people who wrote the software on any regular pc.  Microsoft and Norton, he may know, and maybe the names of Gates and Ballimer and, he'd guess,  Mr. Norton.  but his bios and drivers?  Who wrote Angry Birds, or Farmville, or Facebook?

how doesn't it?
For site 1, begin sequence from position 1,  For site 2, use position 2, etc.  By my count you've got 232 starting places, and that's before you begin to alter reading direction, password length, et ctetera.

I sent you a donation, and I made posts [here-1 ] and on your [board-2] making public motions to get investors interested in a first machine.
Your response has been very slow.
Seriously, if you take three days to respond to a sales lead, how can people expect tech support?
I want to believe this is a possibility, but your slow response has made me very hesitant.  
You also got a GPL warning: [3]
As much as I want to believe in your product, I just don't have much confidence anymore.
A single blurry picture isn't helping.
[this-4] isn't either.  A man sent you 5BTC and got a slow response.  [5] it is on the blockchain.  (Mine is the second donation; 1.276493)
You keep asking us to trust you, now trust us.  I've already sent you some coin; send me a sample that I will review in the USA.   I'll be happy with one daughter board and one control board, with power supply.   I'll post videos on youtube, and if you wish you can post them on your site.  After the review is finished, I will either return the machine to you or I will pay the rest of the money I would owe you to complete the sale.

the forum.bitcoin.org times look to be GMT, (aka UTC) which trails JST by 9 hours.
So it's put the announcement and the crash event within one hour of each other.
[this]( vid captures the tail end of the crash.

idk which timezone their timestamps reference.  
the mgtox crash happened near  3:00am (JST). 
Even if their intro post happened only 30-90 minutes after the mtgox crash, that isn't  evidence of wrongdoing.  possibly of Schadenfreude or sheep-stealing, but you see that in commercial ads all the time (our competitor screwed you over?

tl;dr: Storing a company's $150,000 data file on a device that is  ephemeral storage by  design is not a good business practice.  Doing  so without a backup strategy in place is likewise fucking stupid. Bitomat.pl learned this by experiencing, and exposing their customers, to the clusterfuctstrophe of a loss of that data.
my question: Did bitomat.pl deliberately move this money and burn the trail behind them?

these are cheap.  carry two. or twelve.  Only you'll know which ones are in regular use.  With one card, you're limited to two dimensional 'movement' as you read a password.  With multiple cards, you can find a single position and read the character present on each card at that spot.
Passwords aren't invulnerable to rubber-hose cryptanalysis, but if you depend on these cards for decryption, and these cards are somehow destroyed . . .

no, I meant to put this here.  Just like any other risky investment, use money that you can afford to lose.  I'm collecting a total of $300.00  and no more.    I hope to pay out at least $300.00 and form a basis and history for the future.   I intend to communicate fully, so that if people only get a return of 5 cents on the dollar (which is possible) then they at least can know where the plan went wrong.

Not every company pays dividends.  In fact, most don't pay dividends, but reinvest everything that *would have been* a dividend into assets for the company.
You don't have immediate access to the home address of every company's ceo.
An IPO is a real possibility.  I think that the initial investors will benefit well if the IPO happens *after* the hardware is acquired.
If people rush in with their $300.00, let me hold it for a week while the machine is shipped, then demand their $300.00 back before I can plug it in, we're all in some hurt because I won't have the ability to pay it back then.

yes, I need a calc for that.
x/1 =  1/27  or x/27 today  or x/13 on Wednesday or x/47 on Thursday. [1]
Say tomorrow bitcoin = $26 tomorrow, or $28.  Are you going to renumerate everything with every fluctuation?
At present, bitcoin = +/-15.00.   So one bit-quarter would be 3.75 dollars.  One bit-dime about $1.50  One bit-cent about $0.15.


and there's also a reason your cashier doesn't usually tell you $4 3/20.

the short answer (a guess): cpus can't keep up - thus the need for gpu mining.
@_date: 2011-07-19 22:24:32
regarding the shareholder options:
To repeat what was said above:






and to clarify:
This is a choice for each individual shareholder.
If they take the buyout (option 1) then their investment ends;   they take their bitcoins &amp; run. 
Anyone who remains invested (option 2) has their optional payout reinvested into new cards.   They remain invested at their purchased number of shares.
There will be 100 shares issues at approx. $3.00 each.  In return for my investment ($400.00) I'll get approx. 133 shares.
Dividend amounts will be calculated as such: (total btc earned for the month) / (total shares out)  per share.  
Initially, that's 233 shares.  If a holder sells out 50 shares, then the total number of shares decreases by 50.  The next month, the calculation will be thus:
Dividend amounts will be calculated as such: (total btc earned for the month) / (total shares out)  per share, where there are 183 shares out.
@_date: 2011-07-10 13:39:14
yeah, I did finally get it.  it took like 10 hours, but then I had do do some reboots for other reasons.Hopefully the new client will help.
@_date: 2011-07-19 22:35:59
*Dividends*, then, is the wrong term, as are *share / shareholder*.  
maybe [*DRIP*]( would be a good, but imperfect,  analogy.
This would be a less formal agreement, rewarding the people who stay in the longest.
You're right, though; eventually people will want to cash out and take the btc in return for their loan to me.
I'm listening for suggestions: a (glbse) IPO would be a possibility at some point.

arguably, namecoin is a fork.
this is just grabbing for an x-brand early-adopter status.
@_date: 2011-06-28 03:27:29
It took me 3 or 4 days to figure things out.
Check 
 for hardware.  The ATI cards are what you need if you want to mine.
you're competing for coins, so you want the best you can justify.
Here's what I do.  It helps to have a dedicated mining computer, but if you don't this will still give you a browser to use while the miner is going in the background.  
Get a copy of linuxcoin:
I still use 2a, but your choice is yours.
burn it to a cd.
That'll take you about half an hour.  
While that's happening, start an account at mtred.com.  Choose a secure password: it will become more valuable as you create more coins.  After that, create a 'worker' using the following link:
the worker account is a sub account of yours.   Choose your password well:  I may be wrong,  but I think it's sent in plain text, so don't make it too similar to your other passwords.
When you boot linuxcoin,  you can just hit 'enter' at the login.  Accept the ati user agreement, then  from the (generically termed) 'start menu' - aka the coin at the bottom -  find 'root terminal' in the accessories  and click it.  
It wouldn't hurt to change the root password.  Do that by running 'passwd'
Have the following line either in an accessible usb drive, or surf to this page  for copypaste.  whatever:
    lxterminal --working-directory=/opt/miners/phoenix -e "python /opt/miners/phoenix/phoenix.py -u  DEVICE=0 AGRESSION=10 WORKSIZE=128 BFI_INT VECTORS -v"
    Replace ***user:pass*** with the user / pass of the worker you created on mtred.
there is a 'start mining' script, but it doesn't work for me.  ymmv
at the  linuxcoin download link (above), there are ways to make a persistent install.  again, ymmv
About your wallet: you'll be mining for a day or two before you have enough to withdraw, so use that time to research the linuxcoin wallet and how to secure it.
