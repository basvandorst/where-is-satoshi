An easy disclaimer to make; "photos are only representative of product". If the buyer is going to meet you, and see the product physically I don't think it's a big deal.

Just yesterday I read how the chain is organized to prevent this problem, let me see if I can find the article. IIRC, you don't need to download the whole chain, a client can download only the last x blocks, or a a random portion of the chain. That way the network still holds the whole register of transactions, but the burden per client is lowered.
Edit: [Here]( is a Reddit post about this problem and some of its solutins.

I don't understand how your Gh/s can vary based on pool if your mining software and hardware stays the same. Can you shed some light on that?

It's like 13 year olds on AIM!

About 20 USD cash, and 300 USD in hardware. I needed a new graphics card anyway so I got a 7950 to mine. It is becoming less profitable, but my electricity is free, so I will continue.

THIS IS A SCAM.

Those specialty connectors would be expensive on a small scale like this. I bet they are only making a few hundred of these, and it's hardly server grade hardware. Hot glue isn't messy to take off or replace, I use it frequently on my small projects to give strain relief to wires soldered to perfboard. This wasn't designed for tugging and pulling stresses, only to prevent connectors from wiggling out on their own.

The model B is $35 USD normally, and I was ok with paying a mark up to use bitcoin. It was easier than a credit card or paypal. It also helps bitcoin grow as a currency when people actually spend it!

Spend $2 000 for 20 oz of copper and some other metal, or spend $10 000 for 40 oz. Why not just get 5 orders at $2 000 and get 100 oz of copper?

Good thing we aren't locked into one specific client then, huh?

Why don't you just send me 2 BTC to this address then?
@_date: 2013-03-05 07:52:33
If you are not sure, I would recommend the B version, being able to network, and the extra usb connector are very helpful.
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:56:46
VPN, RAM, Raspberry Pi. Those are so far what I've bought with bitcoin.

Hot glue peels off of hard plastic pretty easily.

Your block chain size threw me off. It's 12 GB, I'm guessing you use the full stop, or period, for your thousands delimiter?
@_date: 2013-03-03 23:01:08
It's a touch more, but my room can get pretty hot, so I turn it down. Averages .05.

Did you see the post by Satoshi about centralization of miners acting as publicly held banks?

Payout is proportional to work done for the pool.
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:15:23
You are entirely correct, pools allow a miner to have a steady income vs the chance of solo mining a block.

~520 Mhash/sec on a 7950 with 1100 core, 950 memory.
Edit; core speed.
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:11:44
No, don't the whole problem is more and more people are using them without looking at the costs or benefits. The benefits might be a fraction of a percent more BTC per work unit, but  the cost would be that BTC Guild has control of what transactions are included in each block, and that defeats the purpose of a decentralized currency.
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:52:31
That had no effect on the real value of bitcoin though, just it's exchange rate. When the AP's twitter got hacked and said two bombs went off at the Whitehouse, the stock market also crashed. Does that mean that the USD lost value? What about the current state of those two examples?
@_date: 2013-03-03 20:47:37
The best part is in the dorms, the electricity is free. So I am mining about .05 BTC a day at current difficulty, and it is all profit.
@_date: 2013-04-20 04:55:05

Good thing China and USA haven't publicly denounced bitcoin yet, although that would just make it more popular. We have to make sure that our privacy online is protected though, otherwise no technology will help us.

You don't have to buy a whole coin, you could spend as little as one Euro or one Dollar and get in on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-05 00:58:20
Something like .14 BTC
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:39:00
Yes, but you can easily change it. Even to no fee at all.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:34:30
I agree, Avalon has great build quality. I think BFL could have engineered a better solution, but they were focused on getting the chips and shipping before getting mobbed. At least they have something out.
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:28:37
Agreed. These are all problems that are known, and therefore can be addressed. On the other hand, actual centralization, and centralization by market forces are two very different things.

ASICs are fast and efficient because they take this same advantage AMD has and multiplies it. Think of them as a calculator that can only do the SHA256 algorithm. That 6990 has 3072 ALUs, but an ASIC will have as many as they can fit on the die. The GPU has to have space for memory, interconnects, shaders, and other parts needed when you are displaying images, the ASIC does not.
As for the rainbow table implementation, I don't think it is possible because the hash for each block is based on the previous block and a few other variables I don't remember off the top of my head. A rainbow table requires the hash to be known, that's why most encryptions are salted with a random number to mitigate this.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:06:08
That's what I'm wondering, is why do so many people use BTC Guild? If they do their job better than other pools then we should be using them to force the other pools to get better. If people are using them because they just don't know or care, then there is a problem.
@_date: 2013-03-04 22:48:03
I ordered it  from  and got it in about a week. Very impressed.

Hot glue peels off of hard plastic. The user could replace those cables pretty easily.
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:38:38
Why do you think that? The reason I see for it is so that if one node goes down, you can pull it and replace it easily. Also, those fans and thermal expansion could produce enough movement to wiggle those connectors loose.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:54:32
I have to wonder why BTC Guild is so favored over other pools? I would think that if they are so much better for miners that other pools would step up to compete.

FPGA manufacturing has not stopped, because it was never specifically for Bitcoin. All OP or anyone would have to do is find any FPGA and program it for SHA256 hashing.

So you really did get just the tip?
