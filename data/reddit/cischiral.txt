Oh certainly *for now* (and possibly forever, hence this discussion).  Bitcoin has an established infrastruction and relative stability/trust that far exceeds any of the other alt coins so far, so they don't really compare.  But in the long run (maybe decades or more) Bitcoin infrastructure is going to become more general to cryptocurrencies in general and there will be other, admittedly still less mature, cryptocurrencies that have most of the same access, plus more bonuses for later adapters.
Most of the new alt currencies will probably always be pump and dump, which will never threaten Bitcoin.  But even if 0.001% of them last as stable entities and their numbers are growing then given enough time (again decades or even much much longer) there will eventually be some serious competition and current trends suggest that the eventual serious competition might grow exponentially.  Whether this will effect Bitcoin at all or not is the topic of this discussion, but if not, why not?  (I am sure there are interesting "why not" explanations, which are part of what I am interested in seeing.)

Totally agreed.  I only see two valid interpretations of TSA in its current form:
1) **The non-conspiracy theory:** this is just one of the greatest conglomeration of mean-spirited incompetence ever packed into a US government agency.
2) **The conspiracy theory:** the point of the TSA is to normalize people to overbearing police state control and fascism.  They went out of their way and purposefully hired the most mean-spirited overbearing would-be power hungry morons to intercept you at the airport and trained them to behave as such.  Then after you have gone on enough trips and been humiliated and harassed by the TSA every unwarranted search and seizure, body cavity search, ect... by the regular police just doesn't seem like a big deal any more.  Their flacks will even tell you so "Oh you are saying you were just sitting home alone and the police came in without a warrant went through all your stuff in minute detail swabbing everything for lab sampling later and then pulled off your pants so they could cram there hand as far up your ass as possible?  Wow ... well shucks, it just ain't any worse then going to the airport, am I right? ****friendly chuckle of the what-are-you-gonna-do-am-I-right? variety****"

Interesting.  Thanks for the thoughts.

Right, that is the hypothetical (very long term) problem I am wondering about.  Again I have no certainty on any of it, it was just an interesting hypothetical issue that has been sort of a brain worm for me and I thought might make an interesting topic of discussion among the pros.

Sadly I am afraid that is exactly how TSA works.  From my interaction (many many times) it is predominately made up of people too incompetent to get any other job, and so upset about their pathetic existence that they came to the TSA looking for a job where they can bully or otherwise have power over people which would be impossible otherwise.  I am pretty sure that for the most part mall cops receive more training and have a higher level of competence.

I am not sure I fully follow, so correct me if I am wrong.  But what I think you are saying is that while this situation might be a possibility if unchecked the are possible solutions that can be made available in the future if and when it arises.  As such, in a distant future where such threats might be posed the full details of the situation can be assessed then, and in such a scenario maybe some small rules and tweaks can be added to the system based on said analysis.  The idea behind such tweaks would be that, with a mature and established Bitcoin they could be subtle enough that they shouldn't fundamentally alter the freedoms made available via Bitcoin, but should prove sufficient to prevent the effects of unintentional absorption and agglomeration into a hyperinflating pool of cryptocurrencies that if unchecked might indirectly undermine Bitcoin.  As this absorption hyperinflation ect... scenario is so distant and hypothetical that the exact details on any such fix cannot be percieved at this time there is no point in trying to assess this situation and make tweeks now because doing so one risks the possibly producing needless, ineffectual, and overbearing adjustments that don't solve the problem.  The Bitcoin community will need to wait for if and when this hypothetical monster begins to be visible, and then, as gently as possible, nudge things to sneak by it.
Is that about roughly correct?


I am afraid I am not sure I follow this at all.  Are you suggesting that if Bitcoin ever hits a stagnation due to competing cryptocurrencies its price will drop far enough to entice new buyers?
