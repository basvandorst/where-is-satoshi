This is what I'm so afraid of. It's not losing all my money if btc tanks that scares me. It's that unbearable regret you will carry to your grave if btc takes off and you get left behind.

Chase is pretty notorious for not playing nice with bitcoins.

Coinbase isn't some random company some schmuck is operating. They have 40 million in venture capital funding and is run by competent people.

Online gaming, as a matter of fact, the internet is a huge part of Korean culture. Bitcoins can really flourish in Korea.

Lol I was thinking who in the right mind would spend almost a billion dollars a year for rent. You could buy a small city with that kind of money.

Wow, I'm thoroughly impressed Dratel scrounged up enough points to make a decent case. I was totally convinced Ross was fucked.

How much money is a reasonably priced cpa/tax attorney going to cost me per hour? I don't have the patience nor the time to deal with this taxing nonsense but I'm no BTC millionaire. Am I going to have to pay all my gains just to get the IRS off my ass?

Looks like in the future, we may have alot of resistance at 1000 prices at bitstamp and btce. I bet alot of Gox folks buying out are holding to at least get out of btc without loosing much money.

Usually they release a lot of rubbish in between the really good documentaries, but I will admit that lately they have been churning out a lot of quality content.
