Not quite: at least in some parts of the US, all major card processors (eg, Visa, MC) allow both Card Surcharging (subject to certain legal limitations in a select number of states) as well as discounts for cash-only (nearly everywhere, I believe). Visa's policy on this is explicitly covered in Visa's terms of use (and I'd imagine in Mastercard's, AMEX, Discover (yeah they're still around LoL).
VISA (USA): 
It's important for the MERCHANT to understand their contract with the processor. There's no single "blanket statement" that covers the globe, with regards to processor/merchant relationships, however.

Happy you have the conversation saved on discord but that doesn't mean anything on the internet. On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.
You got scammed. You learned stuff. It stung. Badly, because you're unfortunately, NOT in a developed country. There is no Nigerian prince trying to get his money out of the country. There is no Russian lady wanting to meet you to escape her hard conditions. There is no hacker that hacked your webcam while you were watching porn. If you get a check in the mail addressed to you that you weren't expecting for a large amount of money, it is fake. There is no free lunch, there is no easy money and there is no fucking spoon. There are SO many scams out there. I understand it can hurt. I really do. But if it didn't hurt, it doesn't mean anything and you won't learn.

This was constructive, incredibly well written, concise as well as informative... and you were actually pretty respectful to that poster.  I really don't think you belong here.
Torches, boys!!! I found us here a SPY!!
