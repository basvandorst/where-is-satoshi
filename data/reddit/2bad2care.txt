Have bought all my crypto using wells Fargo. Most recently a couple weeks ago. Did have some problems a few years ago, and had to call them a couple times, but after i made it clear that I was the account holder in question and would be buying crypto regularly I encountered no more issues.

Sweet dreams. When I close my eyes I see only price charts, and that bitcoin rollercoaster guy meme.. then a vast expanse of darkness.. a void that simultaneously fills my soul with excitement and dread... Anyways! Good night!
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:25:40
Looking good!

 No - it's (500/17500)*30000. :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:51:00
 I'd set a Coinbase alert for $14,000- but what's the point?..
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:26:03
Yep. "Not enough" is what I usually say. With my crypto portfolio getting worth more now, I'm thinking of starting to tell people I already cashed out..
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:28:17
 Get some business cards printed up with that on them. Like Steve Martin(?) would do when asked for autographs. I'm too lazy to Google that or provide a link.. Anybody?
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:06:33
Or- notice how bitcoin has remained at the same price point. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 14:42:56
Technically 1 person could have the keys to all 729,000 wallets containing at least 1 full bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:11:00
.. or just use an Ethereum smart contact. Oops! Wrong forum.. ��
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:54:59
Is there any crypto currency that makes you spend it? Like disappears if not spent in 30 days or something? People might actually use it to buy things instead of hoarding it away.. might be a cool idea..

In what scenario would you sell the majority of your bitcoin - or are you waiting until btc is the new usd?
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:52:58
Maybe you couldn't...
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:10:25
I don't think it would fuck with my head at all..
But seriously, that's awesome if you actually give people money like that. Everyone fantasizes about that happening to them, but my guess is it's just as satisfying to make it happen for someone else..

I'm at 2/20.. since 7 hrs ago.. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:35:20
This 20 confirmation thing is killing me.. 19/20 is my watching the pot of water to boil..
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:16:59
How's your eth stack looking? I think when it really starts going it will take off pretty impressively.. and what kind of future do you see for ltc? Been thinking about dropping some of mine for something else..
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:27:47
Haha.. I actually do give btc out to people.. usually to whomever I'm explaining how it works. Not much, but I'm guessing percentage of my stack wise, it's probably similar to what you part with..
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:49:46
 Cue more laughter..
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:46:31
Any project that promotes a raspberry pi is ok in my book. More people need to know about them..
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:24:46
 Continuously setting these bitcoin price alerts on Coinbase app is exhausting work..
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:00:01
 So - it's a raspberry pi?
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:20:48
So this this depicting sideways movement?
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:53:21
 So if every employer decided to switch their fiat to bitcoin, they all have to buy through an exchange.. there's a set amount of btc, so the price goes up.. then my wages in btc fluctuate weekly?.. and compared to which currency?.. how does bitcoin just become the new USD? And how does new money come into the system? Do miners become the new Fed?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:15:50
Real pennies actually cost about 1.5 cents to make.. can we get rid of this coin already?
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:49:31
Everyone knows you need to wait 9 days - not 7..
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:00:44
 Exactly what I was thinking as I read it. Strangely, there wasn't a mention of private keys, wallets or anyone would store a large amount of crypto currency on an exchange to begin with..
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:14:00
 Just finished reading a pretty good article that breaks everything down pretty nicely. It's probably already up here somewhere, but anyways -
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:04:46
 Guess I'm just trying to picture how the "phase it out" part would work..
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:34:00
 It's a good feeling.. now use it. Don't let it sit around for a month until your holdings grow to a value where you're like - hmm, I should probably protect my crypto better.. oh yea, that thing I ordered and already have sitting here. I'll set that up!..
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:57:26
Why not use a PiZero?
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:00:26
So far...
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:08:21
Bingo. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:35:39
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:50:43
But did he say *"ethereum" ?...
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:53:00
 Made it in the 1BTC club.. feeling pretty good..
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:42:30
Way ahead of you.. my silver stack is strong. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:25:48
 One can dream..
