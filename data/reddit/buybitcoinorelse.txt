Total exchange volume was at $2mil on the 13th of November 2011 when the price was at $3.
The fact is that volumes right now are lower than they were in 2011. That's how illiquid the market is, which goes to the root of the point I'm making.

That's measured in BTC, not USD. 
If you measured in terms of BTC instead of USD, 2010 would in fact be the clear winner (i.e. ~180,000BTC changed hands in one day on MtGox, compared to 977BTC 4 days ago)
It is also not exchange transaction volume, but network transaction volume.
Here is the USD exchange trade volume:
As you can see, any point in recent times (~$1-5mil) is lower than in 2011 when volume hit $5.85mil

There's no point bullshitting bro - fudging the numbers isn't going to change the fact that the market is illiquid and about to crash due to sellers greatly overwhelming buyers at high price levels.
Blockchain.info says that total exchange volume has been at ~$1.5-$4.6mil each day over the past few days.
On the same graph you can look back in 2011 and see that volume hit over $5.8mil


This is an incorrect interpretation of volume. You appear to have merely looked at the visual illustration of volume and not taken the actual price into account.
A volume bar at $380 must 3 times as high as a volume bar at $1180 just to match it in terms of USD volume.
If you look at the hourly chart, ~31.5K BTC were bought/sold at a price range between $380-$500.
This equates to at most $15.75 mil (at $500), or $11.97mil (at $380).
Compare that to the 29th of November when the price hit it's all time high (on Bitstamp) of $1163.
12,903 BTC were bought/sold on that day within a price range of $1080-$1163. This equates to $14-15mil - which is comparable to the amount bought between $380 and $500.
Note that the above does not include much larger amounts of up to 80,000 BTC in a day that were bought/sold at price levels of ~$800-$1050 (i.e. 5th of December)

It does though. Not even bullshitting you bro.
Look at the volume for Bitstamp on July 8th 2014.
The volume was just 977 BTC, and the price ranged between $619.17-$626.88.
Let's say it's $625 on average.
$625 x 977 (BTC) = $610,625
