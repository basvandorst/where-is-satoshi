Anyone else having trouble trying to buy Bitcoin (the real thing) on coinbase?
I'm hearing whispers from people who are longtime verified buyers on coinbase suddenly being blocked from buying BTC on coinbase the last 48 hours.

No, not retarded, 
Check the comment history.
Total anti-crypto, most likely getting a six figure salary in finance or already independently wealthy from the legacy system. 
Remember, one of the biggest mistakes those of us who desire a free world, is assume common ground with everyone.  
Those people find your desire for liberty about of offensive as you find their desire for slavery.
They speak in defense of a world of masters and slaves, and they intend to be the masters.

My first thought, when I see "r/BlackPeopleTwitter, was "You mean white SJW, pretending to be black", then I look down and see the reply, he even admits being white, LOL.
It has been my experience that many of the real blacks are  hence the growing movement.

This is assuming fiduciary duty has the same meaning in China as it does in the west.
And even in the west the authorities usually turn a blind eye to a naked breach of "fiduciary duty", if the fiduciary is part of the "club"*
*Club as defined by George Carlin

On this we disagree.


"He's in jail because the government deemed him a threat to their organization -- and once that happens, the government will find any reason to put you in jail, regardless of race."   
I agree, but that doesn't change the fact that the Judge in the case was clearly favoring the prosecution, instead of being an impartial moderator in an adversarial court system.

"Now you will lose 100% of all your cash."
Sure looks like it could happen.

" transfer the BTC to Coinbase"
I highly recommend getting a second opinion on that.
I'm no lawyer, but that is a bad move, until the estate is settled.
