@_date: 2017-12-19 09:00:49
I agree.
 Thank you for writing what I was not able to write. 
I know many people with the same situation. one of my friends has a pug,  that dog cannot breath well, infections in the face wrinkles.
they had to put foam on the furniture legs because the dog does not see well and hits his had with everything.
the dog cannot be fixed because it will not survive the unesthesia. 
etc. 
thank you.

there is ppl spending, on one of the chats I am in for trading, there is a guy who made 19mln (million) USD! He invest and spends! 
there is this other guy who got in only to buy xmas presents. I advice him to invest and go easy on presents. But he believes in a tree full.of presents.
I believe in the future. I am a girl btw.

@_date: 2017-12-19 06:11:09

my husband and I bought at 3995, bc he did not want to listen to his co worker when it was at 800.
in my first years of finance major, 5 years ago, I talked about it to my hubby, he did not listen and I let it pass. 
of course I did not know sh*t, I was a freshman...ironic
