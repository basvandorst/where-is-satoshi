Does coinbase report to the irs your usd wallet?i figured it was just bank transactions, since you dont technically own any us currency at that point.

Coinbase is one of the only exchanges that lets you exchange your BTC for USD straight into your back account. The Us dollar is an example of a fiat currency.

They're a cotton paper material which can have external uses if it were to lose currency value. As well as the coins are metals. So plenty of shit?

At the end of the day I can atleast make a cup or a bowl out of gold. I can't make fuck all out of a bit coin.

Made an account on it. Looks like its just an online BTC wallet. How is that an alternative to coinbase where I can buy and sell with/into fiat currencies?

Theres no way and even if it did, people would buy it right back. I dont think it can go under 1k at this point because if it ever dips that low every person and their life savings are going to be thrown into it left and right. Its shown too much potential as a money maker, to crash too low ever again.

They can see how many are in circulation and we know it caps at 21 mil.  In the early days you would give someone 5k tokens for a candy bar.

No thats the point of the currency. It has a finite amount.

Does the USD lose value if I decide to just keep 100 of it in my wallet for a few years for no reason what so ever?
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:53:29
inflation isn't due to me putting 100 in my wallet though, is what I'm getting at. Atleast not anywhere near as large of an impact on it as tons of other things.

If memory serves it crashed the day bch launched and never recovered. Just kept going more and more each day.
