Yup makes sense, I think we are at a good point now because I think the  big investors ignored btc for so long or stand by banks so much they missed out and are just now getting in. So let's hope we aren't too late

O no, people know about Google now! Sell sell sell?

Plus if you did that and say you waited 6 months to buy in w 120, you missed potentially 50% gains on that anyway

I should have researched before I asked, that answers my question perfectly thank you! What percentage of people there would you say use cryptocurrency as an escape? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:50:27
Positive or not, the community decides, that's what we fight for. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:35:41
Yup printing this now thanks!

Also for hold on for dear life

So I keep reading posts about Venezuelans moving their savings into bitcoin because of their countries currency issues, my question is though are they not able to transfer it to say the dollar? Is bitcoin more efficient to do that? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:23:38
Is there any incentive to be a major hub w a ton of btc stored on it?

Spent bitcoin for the first time yesterday, paid for a product from a different country. The fees are killing us though 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:16:18
Transaction fees are ridiculously high
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:13:37
This is all fine for bitcoin, I see bitcoin as the precious metal that people stock pile and litecoin as the daily gem they trade. It's good for the whole community 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:11:04
I use this same analogy when I try to explain to people why I believe in other cryptocurrencies 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:09:23
Use alts like litecoin for small purchases then soon immediately atomic swap back to bitcoin if you please

I understand the fee process and who it goes too.  I just don't understand why I sent 5 to him plus the 2.50 for fees so 7.50 all together and he only received 2.66. Is this to be expected. I figured I covered all the fees and he receives a full 5 bucks
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:09:59
Haha, made sure to throw that in there otherwise I'd be broke
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:00:03
I didn't buy anything. I sent from me to him, think that's a different fee
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:52:06
Bought in at 2600, watched in amazement when it hits 5000. Screamed at China then said fuck it, buy even more at 3000. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:33:07
That's what I thought. I told them to send him 5 bucks, they charged me 7.50 all together and then he received 2.66
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:34:48
Pretty sure there were other similar bitcoin ideas before Satoshi 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:56:49
Ok so even though I paid the fee he has to pay one too? So there is no way to send him exactly $5 worth? Still think they ripped us off. They should have upped my fees that way he got the full $5
