That was after the crash...

The 2008 crash wasn't due to money printing, but predatory loans and stupidity. All that can be repeated in a bitcoin based world.

Good point on the housing market as a store of value, but if people decide to hoard their money due to its deflationary nature then we'll need to find an alternative to investing or else growth will falter. At least that is how I imagine it would go if bitcoin was the only currency in our current capitalist system. Is there an alternative to that system that would work with a deflationary currency?

True, and hopefully that would dissuade institutions investing in dodgy assets, but I think greed would always get the better of them.
Edit: some words.

In a bitcoin based world there would still be a possibility for loans, no? How would one buy a house, car, start a business?

Last time I checked the world had a population of around 7 Billion and 134 000. So no, not everyone, just you guys.

Honestly can't understand how you managed to come to that conclusion...

So let me get this straight, Bitcoin users are just the worst people when it comes to picking banks to open an account with?

But your objective 'evidence' takes place in an environment controlled by the state and the rule of law and is therefore not evidence of an environment without a state.

But isn't that more a question of legalisation rather than the abolition of the state? I am all for legalisation, but believe that the state is an important instrument for protecting us against ourselves and facilitating our advancement as human beings in a safe enviroment (a blend of Hobbes and Locke). 
Drug dealers and gangs are willing to fight/kill each other for the right to sell their product even when they could end up spending the rest of their lives in prison as a result. Imagine what they could do to one another when that threat of punishment is removed. However, the argument below about prohibition is an interesting one. Without the state I imagine protection rackets and extortion rackets would be running rampant.

I don't see how that is an argument for a deflationary system driving more money towards investment than an inflationary system. Based on the fact that inflation causes your money to lose value whilst a deflationary system causes it to gain value, investment would be higher in an inflationary system. Having money sitting idle in an account is stupid in an inflationary system, but not bad and risk-free in a deflationary system.


And what would cause it to grow? Investment will be down and consumer spending will be down, as holding on to your money until that product is cheaper will always be a better option in a deflationary system.

But why would invest a deflationary currency when you can just let it sit there and increase in value at no risk? Inflation promotes investment.

If you could find a job that is. Less spending means less jobs. Simultaneously we have a growing population and a growing productivity per capita.
