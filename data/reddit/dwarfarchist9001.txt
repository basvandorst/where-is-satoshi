The great depression was caused 100% by central banking.  Depressions cannot happen in a system based on sound money.  You are peddling long disproven keynesian nonsense.

Its the same story for the DOW, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ.  In fact I think the bubble is more obvious on the S&amp;P than on anything else.

It doesn't need to hit record highs to be a bubble.  The DOW is still far above the inflation adjusted market growth trend.

With the big miners out of the way it could be economically viable to do so.

No you and are ignoring the economics of mining.  If it takes 5 minutes for you to download a block then your effective hashing power is cut in half.  If loading a block takes you more than 10 minutes your effective hashing power is 0.  Allowing excessively large blocks will lock anyone without a state of the art high speed internet connection out of mining regardless of any other economic factors.  The cost of a room full of ASIC miners is far cheaper than the cost of laying miles of fiber optic cables from your house to the nearest city just for your mining operation.

Well no one is going to be setting up bitcoin mining operations in rural Kenya.  As long as it works in moderately developed areas then that is good enough.

If the security of the block chain could be ensured without paying the miners then the miners would not be paid.


I know which one I'd want to have a stake in.
I recognize that more miners isn't always better than more hashing power.  But the number of miners is already too low as it is.  [The 3 largest pools have over 51% of the hashing power.  The 5 largest have 75% of the hashing power.  And just 16 pools together control 99% of the hashing power.](  If only a tiny bit more centralization occurred then bitcoin would be desroyed


If only 0.001% of the population lives in an area when mining is possible then the number of miners will be extremely low.  But if 30% live in such an area then the number of miners will be much greater even though the total number of miners will still be pretty small..

The bloomberg article said the same thing.  I guess it's fine for financial advisers to not understand how bitcoin works because "technology is hard".  That attitude won't last long though at this rate.

People who are willing to buy through the resistance are far less likely to sell then normal investors.  Resistance points turn into support as the price increases because money flows from weak hands to strong hands.  The more money that gets transferred the less people who are willing to sell their coins.  This means reduced short term bitcoin supply and thus higher prices.

Nodes do not receive any of the transaction fees.  Nodes that are independent of the miners make up the majority of nodes.

The difference is between cost being the barrier to entry versus location being the barrier to entry.  Having one is ok, if suboptimal, but having both is unacceptable.

Having a large number of competing miners is more important than having a large amount of hashing power.  If the network's hashing power is low then there is potential for outside attacks but, if all of the network is controlled by just a few players then internal attacks on the network are a certainty.  A balance must be struck between blocksize (network capacity) and the number of potential miners(network security).  The blocksize must be increased butt the question is when and by how much.


It's not about making sure that everyone everywhere can mine.  But mining should be possible for anyone living in an urban or suburban area of a developed country.


Mining's primary purpose is to sever the blockchain by providing security.  The only reason miners are paid is because it encourages more people to mine.

I'm not worried about the blocksize limits that are currently being suggested.  I'm worried about unlimited blocksize leading major players to create multi-gigabyte or eve multi-terrabyte blocks specifically to prevent competitors from mining.


If the majority of mining software creators and the bitcoin core devs were willing to add an optional softcap on blocksizes and have it default to being on then this could be a viable solution.

Before a miner can start mining a new block they must download and verify the most recently created block.  If block sizes are too large this could take a long time.  This would mean that miners with poor internet connections would be at a huge disadvantage.  This is bad because it result in hashing power being centralized even further which reduces network security.

The blocksize limit is what makes that decision.  Which is why we need to have this discussion.  The blocksize cannot stay where it is now in the long term the discussion of what to change it to need to be made soon and it needs to be (nearly) unanimous.

I do.  Between now and the period just before the 2013 bubble bitcoin's USD transaction volume tripled.  At the current price ($360) bitcoin's market cap has tripled as well.  I believe there is even more room for price growth too.   Keep in mind Metcalfe's law the utility of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users.
