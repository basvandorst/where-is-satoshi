Yeah, except all the other costs to bitcoin make it properly fucked. Mmmm, can't wait to give my financial info over to some shady eastern european exchange. Mmmm, mmm...
Let me know when grandma can use it, otherwise it's worthless as a currency and remains a speculative good.
I really think it's time you guys quit calling bitcoin a currency. It doesn't behave like one at all. You've just rediscovered barter in the modern age, congrats.
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:29:10
But what actually matters is whether this inflated currency costs more than the benefit of the extra trade, and there are many strong arguments by many greater thinkers than yourself which have made a pretty good case for the expanded money supply. Your understanding of this topic is shallow at best.
EDIT: So, consider this:
You create more money, and this money drops the value of a single dollar by half. But, if the extra trade create economic activity greater than that loss (if it creates, let's say, 55 cents per dollar), you have a net economic gain. If you have a million dollars in an economy, and add another million (cutting the value of a dollar in half, although this is a horribly simplified example), and the economy before the addition had something like 2 million USD GDP, and afterwards it was 5 million USD GDP, you have a net gain.
Don't be shallow.

Well, luckily, all a spy needs to do is be less brazen next time and you'll be all-in, if that's all they need to do to not look like a spy.
Regardless, I got a chuckle out of this. You guys know this is the internet you're on right now, right? And that reddit, like all other websites with users creating content, is just as legally liable to cooperate with government investigations as FB or twitter or whatever, right?
So if anyone is going to spy on you, at least from the government or any business that wants to spend the money, they can just get all of the info about you, right here.
And I'd be willing to bet pretty much all forum software has backdoors or glitches enough that nothing you've said on a forum is secure in any way either. Not to mention your email accounts.

I study economics and I have never heard anyone call themselves a Keynesian in reality. These "camps" are buzzwords and trigger words used to spark meaningless debate about topics that AREN'T actual economics.
There are three groups of people who examine economics.
One are people who study economics. They may or may not be economists.
Another are "Austrians". They usually know nothing of modern economics, but at some point in history added some useful philosophy to the field.
The last are "Marxists". They usually know nothing about modern economics, but at some point in history added some useful philosophy to the field.

No, what I am saying is at some point in the future, mining will be so expensive that either it will not be profitable at all, OR for it to be profitable, you will have to have such a massive capital investment just to turn a profit that only one entity will be able to do it. It's really the end state of these types of things. It's why there are so many centralized industries today, it's just too expensive for much competition to get into some industries.

Well what do you want? It is best treated as a currency in some cases, and best as a good in others. Context is pretty important and it seems like you may be immune to it, or possibly just being pedantic and/or nit-picking to try to prove a point. Is it a currency? Is it a good?


See how that works?


I believe that falls under capital gains but I am not sure. But I would say yes, technically you would have to pay tax on it. But it's not like an audit is going to get you for an unrecorded transaction like that (as I assume it is). If you do that a few hundred or thousand times, they will probably take an interest.

I doubt it's among economists, but a lot of polisci/military history types would probably say that.
Who exactly is America's competitor? If America invades a nation, all we see are stern words used against them. No embargoes. No military action, other than some guerrilla resistance. No toe-to-toe resistance from a uniformed military, ever, because America will win that fight. No removal from the UN, or removal from security associations like the Security Council.
There is no challenge. Who would it come from? Russia? No, we'd win. China? No, we'd still win. As a matter of fact, they have had to adopt our economics and idea of business by adopting what is essentially "state capitalism", and everything only accelerated after the fall of the Berlin wall and the reemergence of Germany as an ally in Europe.

So she didn't call the credit bureaus to have it removed from her history? Seems like your ex deserved getting screwed, then.
Otherwise, this post is bullshit. IF bitcoin ever gained widespread acceptance, you would see insurance companies covering people's wallets/whatever, and the same economic cost would occur, just on the backs of individuals the worst off of whom can't afford it or will ignore it (see: car insurance... Also, imagine how great it will be when people get denied coverage for various reasons!), and not larger organizations who are more able to absorb these recurring costs (and will also write expenses off of tax bills, versus your average individual, who will not).
If you think credit reporting will go away just because you adopt bitcoin (they won't, they will just be adapted to bitcoin... and bonus points, they'll identify you on the blockchain and give you customized risk profiles based on your consumption history!), you're high on some experimental chemicals you bought from a darknet market.

Probably because using logarithmic axes in cases like this can be misleading, and in this case, I believe it is.
You actually aren't looking at a steady progression upward, as it appears on this graph. That "straight line" that is the regression line would look completely different (exponentially increasing upward).
I am still left uncertain as to why logarithmic scales are being used to display data here, but I assume it is because it fits whatever narrative the designer of the graph wants. I really see no reason for it unless you assume bitcoin price increase is naturally exponential (which is stupid, as nothing remains exponentially increasing in value/price for long).
Also, looking at graphs of past activity to predict future activity without taking anything else into context is a fool's errand, but shh, let's not tell anyone this.

If mining one bitcoin is cheaper than buying one bitcoin, it makes sense to mine and hold it. That's the gamble, essentially, that the bitcoin mined will go up in value versus what you pay for it now, and if mining is cheaper than buying it'll end with more profit, assuming the value increases.

People working in a local economy and sending money from that local economy to another local economy elsewhere are costing the first local economy money. Charging for the service of transferring this wealth from one to another provides 2 things:
First, it provides a disincentive to send the money elsewhere.
Second, it is like a "tax" on the person removing the money from the economy, so that the movement of the money will at least have a portion of it brought back to the local economy, where it was produced, and helping reduce the negative externality that is the lost purchasing power in the first economy.

I'm making an accusation that treated a scamming victim like shit, and the evidence points to it if you actually read the replies. Want me to not be disrespectful? Your community should act like it wants to be respected.


I can't see the thread being deleted, as I am just answering your comments and not revisiting the thread. And NOW it says it's deleted, in tiny little letters, which is not something I generally look at as threads do not get deleted very often.
As for not being subscribed, I am here often enough that it doesn't matter. I don't subscribe to plenty of other subs I participate in. This isn't a valid accusation of "brigading", sorry. I've been posting to this sub for well over a year and I change accounts often.


Glad you agree with my accusation.


I don't think I accused *you* or the *community* of scamming, I said:


Note how the issue is that you shit all over someone scammed. God the thread is a nuthouse of backpedaling on standard ideals held in this sub. It's a true shit show and I was always caught off guard with how immature this place acted. I use it as evidence that at least reddit bitcoiners are the shit of the earth (on average, of course some are OK people, as also evidenced in the thread... but they're the outliers and not the mean).
And the rest of your post is just you giving an example of throwing money at something, which you didn't do in the case I illustrated, so it doesn't matter, because that's the example I gave - you can't say, "Oh see a handful of us mods gave money to someone once, please ignore all the other times we have all been notoriously shitty to new people" lol. Also, no one is brigading anything. I just come to threads and find one I am interested in commenting in. Your paranoia is in full bloom.
Whatever, this place is a shit hole and you are just a mouthpiece for defending it. I am done here, bitcoin is a joke - at least the communities I have encountered.

That didn't change my point, though - over the long term, assuming full adoption, what incentive do merchants have for giving a discount?
If they ALL offer the discount, they're all going to end up with roughly the same sales numbers (since they're all now giving the same discount... Sure, you might have a tiny amount of increased sales, but with such a small discount you're going to end up with barely a difference in the situation - at best, you'll get a tiny sliver of previously unrealized sales. A sliver.) If none adopt the discount, and instead just charge the same prices, they'll keep the same sales figures but increase their margin.
So what incentive do they have in the long term for adoption?

1) It's my view of bitcoin, I am fairly certain it adopts more scammers than actual users.
2) If a bank wanted to destroy bitcoin, if for some reason it felt actually threatened, it would just tank it because it has the money needed to buy/sell amounts of bitcoin that would shock the market to death. Otherwise, if bitcoin is a useful financial instrument, they'll just adopt it like all other useful financial instruments they have adopted or created - and people will flock to them doing that, if it's a useful financial instrument, as they're far more customer-friendly than the bitcoin startups are.

The expanded money supply increases the ability for this to happen by allowing more lending to occur than a fixed money supply would allow, thereby increasing comparative advantage in people lacking whatever type of capital they need to increase their advantage. Without more available credit, interest rates would be much higher and would provide a stronger incentive to NOT take out a loan, especially in services or goods with smaller profit margins or more variable revenues.

Please explain to me the mechanism by which more freely available credit is making these things "so costly". I already know what you are going to say, and the answer I will give to you will be one you will dismiss because of your political ideology, but IN REALITY, fractional reserve banking exists and is widely adopted because IT IS THE METHOD THAT HAS BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL than the rest.

Except large economies such as the US or EU or what have you regulating bitcoin away will have a crushing effect on the value of each coin mined, thus causing miners' marginal profits to go lower and lower, thus causing miners to stop mining. What happens when they stop mining? Transactions take longer and longer to process, thereby reducing the usefulness of bitcoin. What happens when bitcoin becomes less useful? Their value is lowered. And on and on until... Well, zero isn't represented on log charts.

There will be just as much incentive to steal black bitcoins...
The value of the coin is only in how much they can get for it. If they are dealing in black market goods, stealing 100 black bitcoins would be worth just as much as stealing 100 white bitcoins, all other things equal.

At this point pretty much everyone. Most jobs exist because of this increased economic activity.


"Benefits first" is irrelevant, as you are concerned with overall benefit. Just because someone benefits first from something doesn't negate that others also end up benefiting later from the same source. See the idea of a "multiplier" for more information. (EDIT: I go online to buy something. The merchant benefits first, as they receive my payment before I receive the good. Those damn greedy online merchants!)


Whoa, don't cut yourself on that edge bro! Bankers
1. Have capital
2. Lend capital to others without capital so they can create more economic activity for themselves and others
3. Have impeccable fashion sense


Reality is not a zero sum game. Period.

I assume peer to peer is a 1-to-1 lending scenario. Such as, I need $300, so I petition 300 people for $1 each.
That's cool and all, and worked in the past... But it turns out fractional reserves also work, and work better given the evidence of the (generally) booming economy and improved global situations over the past century. Here is why:
Imagine you have those 300 people, and they can only lend a dollar each.
Imagine you have another 300 people, but, giving them the ability to use a fractional reserve system, they can loan 2 dollars each.
In the first economy, there is a total of $300 available for lending. In the second, $600. In the first economy, while individual dollars may be more valuable, the tendency to lend them will be less. Each dollar has higher demand upon it. Perhaps they choose to lend at 10% interest per annum.
In the second, demand for each dollar is less, as there are more available. (Think traditional supply/demand - if there are more of a thing available, each individual unit is worth less. *This is not a linear relationship*, of course... As we add more, the "value" of each thing may decrease or increase, and at faster or slower rates.) Perhaps at $600 available, they choose to lend at 4% per annum.
This increased amount of capital means that businesses or people can afford cheaper loans, and have more businesses/investments available that provide modest profit instead of higher profit. Also, of course, even more loans, so even more people can provide new services or goods as they did not have capital available before.
Yes, *this causes inflation*. But, as long as there is more extra economic activity happening in the second economy than the first, minus the cost of the inflation on the dollar value, this is an overall economic benefit.
I mean to really, really get into this, we really, really need to break out text books and start doing calculus and stuff. Suffice it to say, in a reddit post, I can't prove anything, as in the academic sense of a proof (and neither can you). This would take far too much typing and we would really be having to get paid to do that (that's what professors do, after all). But also suffice it to say I have seen with my own two eyes the mathematical proofs used to describe these things, and if the universe works on math (as it appears to) and all of the data points to us having the right prerequisites (inflation is less than the economic growth provided), the benefits of fractional reserve far outweigh the costs. The increased activity has sky-rocketed investment and technological growth in the last century and has resulted in the greatest developments in human history being possible.
Is it all a lie? Sure. But everything is a lie. Nothing is truly safe or perfect. Nothing even slightly complex is really provable, as you can never make a perfect replica of the system and see what each individual variable does in the smallest of time intervals and with the slightest of tweaks. You can't have an economic or financial system that is perfect, it's too much to ask. But you can have ones that are incrementally improved over time, as ours has been, and it as of so far has provided the greatest achievements mankind has ever completed. Fractional reserves are a part of this as they allow much higher amounts of investing than any previous methods attempted. Bitcoin, sadly, does not appear to provide this same incentive for investment.

I swear to god there's a link there for you to read, but I will indulge you with my go-to example. I hope you understand what I am talking about after this, perhaps I haven't been too clear.
Let's say I can build a house for $100k. Let's also say I can build a car for $50k. Alone, I can have a house and a car for $150k.
Let's say you can build a house for $200k. Let's also say you can build a car for $20k. Alone, you can have a house and a car for $220k.
I sell a house I build to you for $150k. You sell a car you built to me for $40k.
You now have a house and a car, and I now have a house and a car. What did it cost us in comparison to the original scenario where no one was trading?
Me: House cost minus what you've paid. Add the cost of buying the car from you. Also add the cost of building a house for myself. We get 100 - 150 + 40 + 100 = $90k versus $150k, and net benefit of $60k.
You: Cost of building a car minus what I paid. Cost of building a car for yourself, plus cost of buying the house. We get 20 - 40 + 20 + 150 = $150k versus $220k, a net benefit of $70k.
I have comparative advantage in building houses, you have comparative advantage in building cars. Together, through specializing in the goods we have comparative advantage in, we gain benefits from trade and our specialization.

Yes, it expands the money supply, as that money being converted wasn't gained from economic activity in the local economy (EDIT: It doesn't "expand" it in the sense of creating more of the currency, but it does expand it in terms of more of the currency being available to purchase goods, which is literally one of the core methods of inflation). This will produce extra purchasing power from outside. It's the same logic that applies to why foreign aid is generally considered a bad investment. Adding more goods not supplied by the local economy decreases the value of those goods (in this case, usually food). This also applies to money gained from outside of the economy - if we just went to foreign countries and handed them cash (and we do) it adds to inflation (which it does).

Sure it does, just remember, the only people to secure your currency have no long term vested interest to stick around once it becomes too expensive to mine, and as it reaches that level, mining operations will have to be larger, requiring those with large amounts of capital to do it... And meaning the end state is centralization of mining.
But you'll cash out before then so it's all good.
