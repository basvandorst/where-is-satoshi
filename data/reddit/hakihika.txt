So the "Good signature from "Thomas Voegtlin" line is the one that says I have the right Electrum signature?

**Installing Electrum via Terminal**
**Hoping someone can help.** These are the commands I imputed:
`wget 
`wget 
`wget`  [`
`gpg --import ThomasV.asc`
`gpg --verify Electrum-3.3.6.tar.gz.asc`
**The outcome:**
`gpg: assuming signed data in 'Electrum-3.3.6.tar.gz'`
`gpg: Signature made Thu 16 May 2019 01:14:30 PM CDT`
`gpg: using RSA key 6694D8DE7BE8EE5631BED9502BD5824B7F9470E6`
`gpg: Good signature from "Thomas Voegtlin (`[` &lt;`[`thomasv [unknown]`
`gpg: aka "ThomasV &lt;`[`thomasv1 [unknown]`
`gpg: aka "Thomas Voegtlin &lt;`[`thomasv1 [unknown]`
`gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!`
`gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.`
`Primary key fingerprint: 6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`
Based on the warning I assume I did something wrong... anyone have any insight?
Thanks.
