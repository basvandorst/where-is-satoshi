Venezuela had 800% inflation last year that continues -- they are welcoming BTC price fluctuations w/ open arms and are keeping everything in BTC, Pepe, or other crypto.  As for the coffee shop owner -- he just waits for the TX to show in the mempool (which almost instant) Who is going to double spend on $0.88?  Hopefully soon we don't have to worry about confirmation time or cost.

Why is the price of bitcoin relevant? QR code pops up -- I scan it -- shows $0.88 -- done.
Other option would be converting to local currency at an exchange and pay a hefty fee plus take a hit on the then current USD to COP exchange rate -- which changes daily as well.
Also how could the price of coffee change if you purchased BTC the moment you intended to use it -- other then the added 1.5% fee to Coinbase or exchangeXYZ?

Just seen this: "Why are companies continuing to accept Bitcoin?" (Scroll down)

Nope about 2000 Colombian Pesos ($0.70 USD)
Only thing that changes is the QR code my phone scans -- so easy.
30 Satoshi per byte =$0.18 USD transaction fee.

Original comment asks if the price of coffee changes daily
The answer to that is no
Obviously people know the price of bitcoin changes daily "genius"

Yes -- I think this (current scaling issues) will all be fixed by end of the year latest.  If not then I think we will start to see a further "Exodus" into other cryptos.
