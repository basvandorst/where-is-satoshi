Oh wow. I didn't know that. Thanks for informing me.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:01:35
What's the problem with Sourcefourge?
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:40:51
Thanks for answering! What exactly are the benefits of doing this over a standard wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:27:14
I'm holding out for the Cyber Monday deals.
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:45:17
Ah, makes sense. Thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:26:03
How does it being hard to use MtGox make their BTC value higher?
@_date: 2013-10-06 18:24:59
Detecting its use on the network? Nope.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:11:48
How likely is it that the Feds actually were aware of how powerful this makes them and set the focus of shuttering SR to grabbing BTC more so than dampening the online drug trade? Is it possible they were that insightful?

Oh my gosh, this is so cool! And it's in freaking New Mexico! A lot of Americans don't even know it's a state...
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:58:52
So the hashrate can rise infinitely?
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:54:44
What exactly causes the rather large imbalances in BTC to fiat rates across different exchanges?
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:20:18
So is Blockchain.info considered safe then?
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:13:51
That is so quotable. I love that. Haha.
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:27:28
About how much is the fee payout currently?
@_date: 2013-10-22 20:08:51
Ok, good to know. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:35:08
What exactly is a brain wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:47:47
You know it's true. :P I can't remember ever eating here before, but I think I definitely need to try it out now!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:34:53
Just saw $654, oh gosh.
Edit, minute later: $611
Holy crap, it's officially happening: $566
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:53:35
Every time I see the inequality of the BTC to USD prices on the top exchanges I think of this: Would it be possible to buy from the lower cost ones and sell on the higher cost ones for a profit?
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:26:01
I don't think he is denouncing its value, just saying that it has its ups and downs.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:27:15
To the moon, to the server room.
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:07:52
¡Sí, lo amo!
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:47:00
Good to know! Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:50:06
I so enjoy the internet because of people like you and stories like this. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:24:51
They're not doing so hot at the moment... :(
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:46:34
On average, about how many transactions per block are there currently?
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:38:56
Is there a maximum difficulty?
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:57:23
And only just a day ago too. Sorry guys, should have searched here first... 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:35:42
Could you explain what you mean by this?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:43:25
Down again... It's all over the place.
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:32:39
Wouldn't mind some gold myself actually... :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:49:33
Ah, thanks for the insight!
@_date: 2013-10-22 20:08:31
Very interesting. Thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:29:58
Glad you didn't do what? He seems to have been successful.
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:52:43
I'm truly curious, why is this getting downvoted?
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:41:46
That's kind of what I was thinking. Boy do they have a lot of power though. Yikes!
@_date: 2013-10-27 03:09:36
Quite possibly actually. Haha.
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:44:44
What I fail to understand though is how that causes the actual price to be higher? Is it just the increased demand from it being so hard to trade?
