Maybe so, but I don't think the judge is suddenly going to flip sides and agree that all drugs should be legalized. Those kind of changes take place legislatively, the role of the legal system is simply to enforce the laws on the books.

The question is whether you can really build an antitrust case here. I tend to trust the EFF's analysis on these issues:

Those beliefs are pretty much a product of conservative groups that make up the Republican base. 
I think a libertarian candidate could actually do well in a general election if they combined libertarianism with more moderate views on social and economic issues. In other words the Silicon Valley kind of libertarianism rather than Ron Paul libertarianism. 
Things like protecting privacy, having a sane foreign policy and decriminalizing drugs are actually quite popular. But when you start talking flat tax and eliminating welfare many people rightly or wrongly see that as a pander to the rich. And socially conservative views are a non-starter with a majority of voters especially young people.

Was the internet ever free from regulation? Pretty sure the FCC (not FTC) already had the power to regulate it. As far as net neutrality goes, let's see if anything really changes. Lots of fear mongering out there but it is almost all coming from vested interests with something to lose (such as Comcast, Verizon and other ISPs).

If the journal was fake, that seems like a strange thing for the defense not to mention during the trial.

That's strange, I thought he was against religion.

Yeah for a company that aspires to (in their own words) "a reputation built on credibility," you would expect a really nice brand and site but this just looks very cheap and hastily thrown together. Stock photos, sloppy spacing and typography - you can get better results by installing a prefab WordPress theme. And the logo looks more like the ghost from Pacman than a kraken.
