As long as there's no source code, I can't trust this device.

Actually, I couldn't find any schematic or firmware for opendime. It would be nice to verify stuff like this without heresay.

What kind of storage does it use for the keys, then?

No. The last trade.

No, the "price" is the last trade actually performed there.

Browsing wikipedia about applications for cryptography in 2009. Was intrigued by hashcash and especially Bitcoin :)

Heh, that's like vandalism, as the coin is no longer 1BTC. I like it! Take that, OCD!

In the long term, I think it will make sense to trust centralized services like  for small transactions. Of course, your customers must have a "prefilled" account for you to accept payments that way.

They say they are afraid of kidnapping. I guess that makes sense in Panama, but it certainly stops me from investing anything.

Hm, thinking about it, you don't need to waste cycles checking known hashes, you simply demand proof of work from the SHA256 engines by checking the error rate of all results that are solutions to a difficulty lower than the actual bitcoin difficulty.
This lower difficulty is set such that you get a steady stream of answers to keep error statistics, but not so high that you swamp the "golden" SHA256 engine (e.g. host CPU).

I only briefly looked at the opencores design for a bitcoin miner, and I was under the impression that the technique used was to always marginally clock the SHA256 engines. 
I didn't look to closely, but the margin of operation is maybe found by verifying that the engines produce a certain small percentage of erroneous results (e.g. by sometimes hashing known hashes). When error rate is too high, increase voltage or decrease frequency. Too low error rate: You're hashing too slow or too inefficient.
This is inherent in bitcoin mining: false negatives are just like skipping a nonce, false positives can easily be refuted.

According to the OP on the forum:
The firmcoin BEFORE sending the private key enters a special internal state "no-funds". The private key is NOT immediately wiped. You can query the device for the private key as many times as you want until you're satisfied the transmission has no errors.
Then you send the firmcoin a command "wipe" and the firmcoin will wipe the private key.
The firmcoin will never go back to the state "funded" after the state "no-funds" without going through the state "create-new-key".
