Starting Jan 1 in US new tax law only real estate is considered like for like and gets capital gains exclusion. All trades prior to 1/1 are thought to be fine. Going forward you’ll need the info even if BTC to LTC direct. This could always change. You should consult a tax professional if any concerns.

Look at the people who claim to be making money from cloud mining. When I started researching this, I saw most of their gains were coming from referral fees (off their YT) and NOT from the actual mine payouts. Was going in to BTC with plan to eventually buy HashFlare now decided just to buy coins &amp; wait. I like the idea of being in more “control” this way too, fwiw.

Thank you for this. About to buy a HW wallet. I'm a new adopter but I do understand the tech. Smaller/faster transactions are important to me, and I believe achieving that will secure the future of crypto. Kicking myself for not getting in earlier. At first I probably was thinking profits from this would be nice, but the more I read and learn, the less I want to go backwards from crypto to fiat just to make a quick buck. It's no longer about that, for me. Anything else we can and should be doing I'm in.

I’ve not sold any just accumulating my position at this point. When you go to sell do you do this from multiple wallets at those laddered positions, or do you keep track some other method? I’ve been DCA’ing on the dips but it’s creating new wallets each time. Assume once I move to GDAX I’d consolidate. But funding with USD direct bank connection. Does a single wallet selling somehow eff up the Strat you describe? Sorry lots of questions and yes I’m new. Followed the tech for 2-3 years, but my life wasn’t in any position to invest until recently. Kicking myself I couldn’t find even $100 back then. Just happy to be able to now. Thanks for your thoughts on all this.

Thank you for this link. I couldn’t find the one I was reading earlier.

No. I can lose it all. I just was hoping not to. There’s a difference. I went in with extra. Doesn’t mean I don’t want it to turn into EXTRA EXTRA.

Gotcha. Makes sense. And does indeed suck.

1.  This is awesome.
2.  Should remain empty
3.  Seriously considering starting HODL merch line that accepts only BTC called "Forever HODL"
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:18:12
What’s the fee on that? Just curious. And does it create a new addy each time?
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:27:06
Sucks their merchant code and processor changed and you didn’t get a heads up. At least it did decline the cash advance APR has to be gigantic and it starts the day the transaction hits their side. Not that I’m advocating this if you carry a balance but if you pay off the card each month, then chase online should allow you to balance transfer to your checking account for 3% or 0% which is against your total credit limit not your cash advance amount (prime just increased so it won’t be that low for long) and then you’d have cash to buy direct. The transfer should take anywhere from 1-3 days. If you pay off that card every month should be ok. Hope this helps.

I’m looking at the last hour and flipping the f out man I’m glad you’re calm. I need to be calmer.

It's weird to me too but I'm trusting it'll be there when they say it will and locked at the price when I pushed buy. Have had a few more Buy transactions recently and some are actually moving faster, I think it depends on the amount...
Do you transfer from bank to the USD? Or straight from bank to the bitcoin wallet?

Thoughts on timing as newbies finally getting coins deposited when that 9800 hits will they panic sell. Will it last longer this time?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:10:48
Beautiful! Merry Christmas to you and your Mom 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:33:40
Is this why it’s taking so long to get coins confirmed / transferred even after the deposit left my account?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:45:42
Thanks for this! New to this and your graph finally helping me make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:20:25
To HODL or not to HODL
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:42:29
What are you willing to pay for it and what can you afford to lose? If you’re never selling then your money invested really isn’t invested. It’s more like parked. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:21:06
FML @ 5K the TX will take 3 weeks.

Diversified is the traditional advice. Depending on how young you are I’d go like 25% large cap 25% small cap 25% growth &amp; income 10-20% crypto 5-15% international

It’s not me! That’s funny tho. 575.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:15:26
Where can I read up on proposed scaling solutions, please? Bought in for the tech of it, not for the heck of it. -TY
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:07:49
Yes. All others taking TWO WEEKS to verify before buying anything. Some not even able to verify. So the new people didn't really have a choice. As this becomes mainstream people will want iOS-esque / simple UI. Giant BUY buttons. Huge charts. Not too many options. I feel like I could set up my grandma on it and she'd be able to operate. The alleged manipulation if true and fees aside, its a good starter platform no doubt and hoping they can keep pace w/ future growth.

Thanks so much for this!

Literally me in 9 years...
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:20:02
Yes. If you want life changing monthly passive income. Then buy your own home with those profits.
