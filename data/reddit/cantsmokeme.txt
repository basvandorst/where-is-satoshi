Actually it's a loss. I want what you're smoking.

You should dump all your holdings into it. So the rest of us can reap the benefits.

Some of these are unfair to say. BTC is rallying right now so of course your ratio's are off from the original. However your portfolio hasn't necessarily gone down (haven't done the math exactly) You're looking at this wrong. I believe in BTC, but I don't believe it will hold a 40%+ market dominance at all times.

I'd reconsider this man. Get some coins that have been around for awhile. I might agree with ark and steem (though I think steem won't go up much in dollar price) but the rest are pretty gimicky, even maybe ark (hodl and hope)

That's not even a quote from me? Reddit definitely logs your MAC address.

What's the other 1% besides XMR?
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:00:41
Of your router, yes they do. Unless you have a VPN/VPS set up, which I would include under my initial extreme precautions message

But Satoshi's vision man, I'm like personally saying fuck you.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:59:16
No your router has a mac address.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:58:25
What basis do you have for these claims?
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:49:42
MAC and IP addresses.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:29:37
I hate to burst your bubble but you're posting on the internet. You're tied to this reddit account just as much as you would be to twitter and instagram unless you took amazing precautions. Reddit can give this false sense of anonymity and before you know it your coins are blacklisted and you have tainted BTC that will never be sold back to an exchange.

Coinhive! But there's a 30%fee and it's XMR.

I don't think DPR = Ross.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:28:56
DPR would never have put his real email into his PGP, do you really buy that? I have a tendency to not follow the official narrative, especially when so many perfect coincidences lead up to a big "bust"

He didn't know asics would come in to play, outdated quote.

CNN is propagandized.

Twice as secure....there's not someone with half the coins in a wallet. Bitcoin was premined.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:58:40
Definitely disagree. You think the whales are buying drugs?
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:13:47
Theres a wallet that could crash the entire value of BTC and  noone knows who owned it. Only that they gained this BTC before BTC was public. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:09:28
As a Libertarian I agree with your reasons. But, I really think whales/chiners play a bigger part than you're thinking.

Other countries spell other countries differently.

Use LTC its price is really stable and it has segwit and low fees.
