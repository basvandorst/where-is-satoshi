All these first generation rushed chip efforts are risky as hell.  Silicon doesn't forgive.  Every asic provider to date has missed their targets and estimates or outright failed.  Avalon, BFL, Asicminer, bASIC.  They all had experienced engineers working behind their respective sales teams, yet delays happened.  It's totally normal.  The same is true for AMD, Nvidia etc...   so let's all temper our expectations.  It ain't real til it's real.

Easyminer uses any pool you like.  The default pool is eclipsemc.  It pays out bitcoins in minimum payments of 3.  If you want to change the payment threshold, create an account at eclipsemc.com and enter in your worker name in easyminer, then you can use eclipsemc's account control panel to do anything you want including switching to PPS instead of DGM. That way you can get paid for each unit of work directly instead of waiting out the luck factor of DGM.

PPS takes all the risk out of it and gives you the nice feeling of getting coins coming at you consistently.  I think most people prefer PPS, but it does cost a little as a small % goes to the 'house' providing PPS.  Effectively, they're taking the risk on your behalf, so when things are dry you still make money.

Congratulations on the rig.  It looks pretty damned impressive.  How much is it making for you a day?

Another first generation ASIC dreamshot.  Good luck guys.
