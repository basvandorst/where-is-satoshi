You mean his original one sentence post which I replied to somewhat humorously?  Or do you mean the post after that where he started BS about English grammar which I then addressed seriously but YOU then decided to post a similarly humor and short rebuttal to me?

Pfft.  Sources exist.  For example, there is tracking for the blending of "regardless" and "irregardless" to mean the same thing.  The debate over oxford comma use is also documented.
There is NO discussion or reference to "then" and "than" becoming interchangeable in Modern English. Hence my request for a source, maybe the poster had seen something I hadn't.  No surprise, he made it up.
As for being pedantic for asking asking for a source?  He spoke from supposed authority, how else to call someone out for BS.  If a "then"\"than" usage was blending it'd be documented somewhere(probably by annoyed English snobs).

Wow, writing more turn you from a troll into a basic troll, sad.  I mean it sort of looks like a discussion but it's really just you raging hypocritically again.
I fail to see how me providing examples of how language IS ACTUALLY changing (which would validate his point not mine if he could back up this instance) is somehow "name dropping".  I don't think you know how discussions work, just hate.
According to you if I say too little I'm a mean person for not engaging, too much and I'm the worst for being pedantic and debating details.  A catch-22, where YOU basically don't actually want to have a discussion you just want to vent on someone, well this is the internet as you said.  Luckily, I have thick skin and I knew what was going on, the time you spend raging on me you weren't inflicting yourself on others who might actually have been hurt when you finally snapped and showed your true self with basic typical troll slurs.
Using "autistic" as you did is reprehensible.  First off it's misused here and second it's not something a person can do anything about so to use it as a slur is the same as mocking height, ancestory, or skin color. (Yet you claim being pedantic is worse? as I said before look in the mirror, hating the "different" is way worse than being pedantic no matter how you look at it.)  I wasn't the least bit surprised you went there, I was sadly expecting it, as it's basic troll device.
I'll be blocking you in a bit as such slurs and hate speech cross the line for me.  I did want to give you a chance to read over this however on the off chance you even care to improve\change.  If not then go troll with other trolls.
Later Days.

Where?  Every single reponse you have made has been simple mocking or name calling. 


You're STILL full of BS.  My first post in this thread was a joke about word misuse.  The second was calling out a poor argument.  You jump in with "durr U my hero internet guy .. Pendantic.. Blah." and have continued this single note through our interactions.
Show any place where you have added to the discussion or stated a point followed up with support?  That is engaging in the argument(which you'll note I have done with with you repeatedly), what you are doing isnt that.  
Your claim moves you from plain hypocrite to (giving benefit of the doubt =&gt;unintentional) troll.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:11:03


You're just wrong.  Got a source anywhere?  Your local dropouts?


There currently isn't a world language.  A world language is stupid.  Think about what would be lost, no one langugue will be able to encompass all the concepts when there is a myriad of languages.  Study linguistics.


This isn't a case of exception.  It's two words that sound similar but mean different things.
Instead of bashing English try improving yours then figure out how to "fix" it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:18:16
Are you off your meds?
As I said before, I only asked for sources AFTER the poster claimed that then and than were interchangeable in Modern English. The poster could have just as easily edited his post but instead claimed he wasn't in the wrong and made stuff up.    He got called out, can YOU show any evidence anywhere that "than" and "then" are becoming interchangeable, I certainly couldn't find any.
Again as I said before, such changes I   the English are actually tracked and are source-able.  Maybe the poster had knowledge I didn't and I would learn something.
Whatever you are ranting about ... I don't know other than you going from annoying to actually wrong . As for me being the very worst person.. I'm quite sure there are worst.  At this point most would probably put you among them, as most destest trolls and hypocrites.

It's messed up because a "kilogram" is a base unit. A prefix has no business being in a base unit ESPECIALLY some rule ONE is prefixes carry through the calculation. So a kg.m/s2. Should be a kilonewton ... The very core of the SI system is broken.
Also ANY system can and do use prefixes. Take millinches, those are a thing.

@_date: 2017-12-12 03:37:12
Google "SI base unit mass" EVERY LINK says the kilogram is the base unit.  Period.  Pick up any actual.acience textbook that uses SI unit.  "kilogram" is the base unit... End of discussion.
Additionally, to negate your point, no other derived SI unit uses a "prefixed base" in its derivation.
Yes,yes the imperial system is messed up.  However you can't claim the metric system is perfect, it isn't with this turd of a screw up sitting right in the middle if its foundation.  
As I said Consistency isn't analog, its binary.  "Perfectly consistent" SI ain't,  why defend it as such?  Is it better than Imperial?  For the majority of thingd, yes.  
Why do you have to be "all in" to defend SI as perfect when it isn't.  Just fix it.. Oh wait then you'd have to admit to screw up all this on the past... Well guess what , that's science\progress.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:10:29
Yes, a Newton is derived from a kg.m\s^2.  If metric is "consistent" like everyone claims why isn't that a kiloNewton?  Prefixes.should carry through  .. Some idiot decided to use a prefix in THE BASE UNIT FOR MASS which then affects every derived unit that also uses mass and all the other metric zombies just follow along.
Also if a "kilogram" is a singular word for a base mass unit then a "millikilogram" is the correct format.
If a system isn't consistent it's like you say "mad".  "Mad" however isn't a gradient, its binary.  So yes, Imperial is mad but so is SI.
Edited: for millikilogram

Point by point:
1. See nonvoting shares of stock. Point disproved.
2. Bitcoin can be lend for interest, income.  Point disproved.
3. It's scarce.  If you think other cryptocurrencies make bitcoin less scarce... Any of is could fork bitcoin right now, and there already are DOZENS of bitcoin forks worth zero (many of them created simply for development experimentation), why?  Because there are no miners, and no one is interested in it (no demand = zero value). Point disproven.
4.  Just because there may be a bitcoin bubble doesn't mean the true price will wnd at zero.  Tulips bulbs arent free are they?  Point disproven.
Your title: I'm sure there are collectors out there willing to pay more than a cent for a bitcoin.... Is there a collector willing to pay more?  Boom not only is bitcoin not zero but a market exists.

@_date: 2017-12-12 04:00:15
Am I arguing that point? No. I guess.you can keep rattling off order of magnitude conversions.  However ANY system can use prefixes for orders of magnitude.  Big whoop.  Gigabytes.. Heard of them? 
What is the base unit of mass? A kilogram, what is a prefix doing in the name of a base unit?  BUT WAIT it's not because No ONE says "centikilogram" ... Plus letting a prefixed unit be used for deriving more units? Majorly wrong in SI.
Can you honestly not see how f'd up the kilogram as a base unit screws everything up? A km/ks reduced to m/s, that is the GOOD part of prefixes the cancelling or addition during operations,... Until you get to the kilogram (and the N it's derived from) which for some reason is a huge screwup but also a blind spot for metric fanatics.

That one is my bad, it's late and was in a hurry.


It's not fabricated.  You, or others here have claimed SI is "perfectly consistent".  This is proof it isn't which is sad because it would have been aneasy ,and proper fix.  Now it's near impossible because fools want to ignore it hoping it goes away.


Are we measuring screwedupness?  In SI or Imperial?  Just because Imperial may be more messed up doesn't somehow mean SI couldn't fix it's mess.  You are you grading on a curve?


Ah "minutiae", I think you mean "technically correct" which is really the only kind.  Sure, if it was some obscure derived unit it'd be "minutiae" but it isn't it right square at the beginning as flows through nearly every derived unit.  It's actually fascinating researching how this happened, you should.
As for Imperial conversions...how often do we actually have to convert from feet to miles?  Hardly ever.  Feet to yards? Divide by 3... Child's play, literally.  Oh definitely the whole pounds-force &amp; pounds-mass totally sucks.
But scoring Imperial poorly doesn't somehow erase the bad marks in SI.

You can't say it's "completely consistent" until the kilogram thing is fixed until then it isn't.  It's kinda a binary thing the way you phrased it.
As for "workable", so is the imperial system. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:52:35
Seriously are you so blind?  WTF is a Newton?  A kg.m.s^2, right?  What is a PREFIX doing in a nonprefix derived unit?  
My m/s example WAS to show how it's supposed to work.  It doesn't work for mass (kilogram)
The rule for prefixes is ANY PREFIX CARRIES THROUGH to the derived unit.  So a millisecond^-1 is a millihertz, right?  This doesnt happen with ANY DERIVED UNIT THAY USES MASS since mass is a "kilogram".
The "kilo" in kilogram should make the following : kg.m.s^-1 = 1kiloNewton but it doesn't.  The reverse is also true.. A g.m.^-1 = mN , seriously lol on the left side of that units a show me where the "mill" is.  You're claiming metric is some perfect system but it's designed to screw kids up day one(and apparently in your case even blind you to the obvious forevermore.)
Sorry that is way more screwed up than simply having various measures, Imperial units doesn't even pull this crap.

You are wrong for insisting your memory of a single instance somehow supersedes a preponderance of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
Claiming the 2 "extra places" are there but normally hidden?  WTF is that?  Check the actual CODE or take the time to do research like I suggested.   No, you want to argue you aren't wrong about what you saw, guess what? People miss remember stuff all the damn time.  Even if you did ACTUALLY see it as you remember it was probably bad coding on a shite page.  But no "you saw it that one time" , gimme a break,

Just because something is unsustainable doesn't mean it's zero-sum.  Perhaps you should review some basic definitions.  (You have a masters degree, I leave that as an exercise for the reader.)  I gave examples above of how the world economy isn't zero sum.  Zero-sum doesn't apply when the "finite circumstance" changes, seriously how can you have any kind of grownup discussion at a supposed UN level?

"go read wittgensteings refutation of logic, then you might understand why your logical claims on which you proof is based means so little to me. "  -- No, I understand perfectly.  You use logic, and its language, went it helps your position but as soon it doesn't you claim logic is magically refuted.  Also a nonsensical phrase as “refutation can only occur in a logic rational framework".
"I demonstrated how supply-demand equations are based entirely on zero-sum assumptions and the world economy is based largely on supply demand. No, you didn't.  You simply repeated "yes, it is." over again.   You have said the world economy is "zero-sum" meaning the world economy is the same size it was during the Stone Age. Every invention the increases productivity changes the size of the world economy, nonsense.
"This entire exercise is for me practice on how to deal with laymen and not well learnt individuals, of which Im accustomed to."  Good, you need more practice for sure.  If you are assuming I am a layman, and “not well learnt” you should be able to discuss things at a layman's level.  You really need to work on your classiest attitude, snobbishly throwing out the need to read "Wittgenstein" in order to understand you and your point is pure intellectual elitism on your part.

"All of life is a dream anyway, prove to me its not."
It's not, why?  Prove to me it is a dream.  But okay "master in philosophy", I will prove YOU don't think it a dream.  If you are in a dream then nothing matters so there is no motivation to change anything, the very fact you are "trying" shows you know this is not a dream.
"I have a master in philosophy, and have 3 publications on ethics in the UN. "
Perhaps you should spend some time on economics and LOGIC and not ethics.
"the world economy is zero sum"
Wow, just wow.  It isn't.  I build something that didn't exist before that is worth dollars I am ADDING to the economy.  A storm destroys a town.. that destruction of value subtracts from the economy.  Now some parts of the economy are "zero-sum" the WORLD ECONOMY.

Yes, anyone can and should be encouraged to use bitcoin as currency. ...again encouraging math-weak people to trade it is irresponsibe.  So to say mBTC should be used to facilitate for trading is bad.  mBTC for everyday purchases is ideal.  Do you not see the difference?
