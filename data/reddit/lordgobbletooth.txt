Not much confidence right now, that's for sure. Will probably continue to fall (gradually) over the next few weeks. Bitcoin is stable enough nowadays to where the 
"crash of 2014" isn't likely. However, completely within realm of possibility that value will decline to ~$750 or lower and then level off for a time.

Very glad I bought in yesterday before the price jump. Had a feeling it'd spike after the market regained stability. To the moon!

You'll need a time machine that can go into the past, but yeah, you could definitely use your laptop. I'd recommend setting the dial to January 1, 2009. Safe travels!

How about you take your ‘asset’ and shove it up your ass, Mr. IRS agent.

Used to solo mine on bitcoin core wallet using a consumer-grade desktop PC. Gods, those were the days.

Darn, I got all excited thinking I’d finally be able to buy fruit juice with bitcoin. :(

Is it just me or are sell orders starting to dry up? Looks pretty thin on gdax. Definitely some resistance at 6850.

Take some of your profits when you’re ahead. There are plenty of stories on this very subreddit where people never sold and ended up in the hole.

You should never keep crypto on exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:30:59
GDAX offers 0% fees for maker trades. That and some limited protections for held fiat (e.g. FDIC insurance).
They’re not perfect, I get that. But I feel as though they’re one of the more trustworthy exchanges, all things considered.

Honestly, I'd just keep it. 0.01 btc is not a whole lot unless you absolutely need the cash now. Might as well hold on to it. The price may go down in the short-term, but I suspect it will go back up eventually.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:12:24
It’s your money, but my unsolicited advice is to never sell more than 10% of your holdings in a day. DCA all the time. Crypto is so unpredictable.

I would assume that bitfloor has some ability to resolve this sort of matter - I'm sure it's happened before. Just tell them and wait for a response. You might need to prove it's your account, though.

When people ask I say that I have investments in bitcoin but I don't tell them how much total I put in or the amount it's worth right now. Usually mentioning bitcoin is enough to start a conversation and they forget to ask how much I'm worth.
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:16:46
I'm holding for long term investment. I couldn't give a crap what happens.
@_date: 2013-06-07 07:52:13
If it isn't technically so, then it isn't. Make up your mind.
If you really want to push the point, then I'd argue that atheism in its general form (not in the sense of atheism that Jains or Buddhists have) is irreligious.
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:15:23
That verification is good enough for me! Just sent 9000 btc to wikipedia!
@_date: 2013-06-07 22:07:43
I don't disagree with that. Perhaps I should have clarified better.
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:13:30
If you count the virus that's been going around and demanding $300 worth of btc, then yes.

Quoting C.S. Lewis to make your point does not make me want to continue reading your rubbish. You mistake militant atheists with most of us (including myself) who honestly couldn't give two shits what anyone else believes, as long as you don't impose your beliefs onto my own liberty. Which often does not seem to be the case.
My lack of belief is, essentially, atheistic. Man does not equal god, as man is not a myth!

Atheism is not a religion. It's a lack of belief in theism.

Don't believe that bitcoin is quite mainstream enough to warrant that. I mean, I'd love to see a course on Coursera regarding the economics of bitcoin too.
