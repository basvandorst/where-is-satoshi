From a seller / publisher perspective:
You can't use the payment data to identify the person behind the purchase to enforce region locks.

This is using the weierstrass curve as example, which is the usual approach. It's also used in bitcoin, so using it as an example here is probably reasonable.
But there are also other curves, like the [edwards curve]( which I found much easier to understand intuitively, because it's very close to clock arithmetic. Bernstein was giving an introduction at the last chaos communication congress:

The main issue for riot games is probably that they are selling leveled accounts and ELO boosting.

Don't interpret to much into this. This wasn't an intentional legislative decision, they just applied the existing laws. Bitcoin appearently falls under the same rules as general goods (the article calles them privately held movable asset). Btw, gold falls under the same rules.
There are special laws for stocks, funds, interest and real estate, but appearently they don't think these special laws could be applied to bitcoins.

They do in europe. There is a limit for cash payment in [italy]( of 1000€, the limit in [spain]( is 2500€ and in [france]( it's 3000€ and they discussed to lower it to 1000€. I guess there are limits in other countries as well.
They also discussed to phase out the 500€ note [(german source)]( to make large cash transactions more complicated, but for now they will keep it.

Where does this "fee-less" always come from? You usually need to pay a fee to get your transaction into the blockchain and for microtransactions (1-10 cents) it's a rather steep fee.
To be realistic, you still need a payment processor for microtransactions in bitcoin, that accumulates transactions.
