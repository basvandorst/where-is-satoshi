Man, I almost feel bad for me now. I got a similar email but apparently my life is only worth .5 BTC...
I want you to take this message serious, if you value your life, since this is not a joke or a scam. I have been thinking for a long time whether it is worth sending this message to you and decided that after all you have the right to know. I'll try to be as short as possible. I've got an order to kill you, because cause trouble to some people. I studied you for quite a long period oftime and made a decision to give you a chance, despite the specifics of my job, the rules of which do not allow me that, as this will kill my reputation (more 10 years of flawless executions) in my circles. But i decided to break some rules since this is my last order (I hope).
In general, let's Break it down. I want you to pay the amount of 0.5 BTC. I accept btc. Details how to forward funds in this currency you can Google. Here are the details below:
When i'll receive funds I'll tell you his name, as well as all other the evidence i have. You will be able to use them with the authorities. I would not suggest you to call police or make any other mistakes, because you have a very little time (2 days) and they simply will not have enough time to find out anything. Responding to this letter does not make any sense, because i use one-time mailbox. I will let you know as soon as i will receivefunds. I really regret that you became my victim.
