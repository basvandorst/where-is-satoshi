Was it Nixon who lifted the relation towards gold reserves? 
Hell broke loose after that and we are just now realizing it..

Could you tell me more about how commercial banks create money when i take a loan for an appartment, house, car etc? 
Dont they get an amount of made up money from the central bank and then have to manage the amount based on loan requests, amount and payback plan? 
Thanks in advance.

I’m in similar situation as OP. What will make the situation not to last? Cause it’s harder now than in vary many years to set your life / economy in order right.  So what do you think will brake the chain? Personally I don’t se anything unless crypto or wining a power lottery.
Happy to take part of the knowledge.

I’m in a very similar situation thinking the very same thoughts living in Sweden. 
It’s not as bad here but when I can buy an apartment I’ll be 50-60 years old due to so many people being able to get cheap loans the past 25 years. Now it’s super expensive and for me to get over the fence requires a massive leap and cash. I’m just left here and salary’s don’t reflect this situation at all, in fact they haven’t gone up much at all since the 80s where I live.. 
I’m not all into crypto tho, I also invest in stocks and also some in myself cause idk if I’ll live next year or in 20 years, maybe alien attack or whatever occurs, who knows.  But I really hope that crypto is a wealth distribution mechanisms within a few years. And I’m not asking for much, just being able to own my own place of living and maybe a car. But all that, as of right now is not an option. And I even have a management job position. I was just born too late.

Well I agree on that. But how does all the money turn up? I’ve gotten attractive education, work hard and perform well. Doing better then most in my age and still I’m way off track compared to people just 10 years ago doing far worse than me. 
Future change don’t often benefit the poor or the groups that needs it the most. The richer will get richer, that’s all I’ve come to learn in my adult life. Unless bitcoin or drastic economic change happens, I don’t see it.

Should you really need to take mortages to own a home in the first place? 
At least for me these are the things I want to escape.

Howcome bitcoin took a market hit at the same time? This, if anything proves the value and power of bitcoin. But the graphs don’t reflect that. Any bright mind here to give me some insight?

what a mouth-breather that guy was..

Well hes not wrong. And this is expected from a complete douchebag. To protect what they know and what they own. What they own is complete power around FIAT and the illusion of value as well as ”all is good” among the drones (drones being normal ignorant or un-informed humans) . 
Still tho. This is only good for us. Free press!
