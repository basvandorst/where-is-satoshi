Nope that's not at all what i'm saying, can you quote where i said that?
I'm talking about the huge environmental impact of bitcoin mining, which is tremendous and countered your  "it's eco friendly" bullshit argument you brought up.
With a network hashrate of 110 million GH/s, the network needs 0.7333 x 110 million Watts = 80,666 kW. This equates to 80,666 kW x 24 hrs/day x 365.25 days/yr = 707,120,500 kWh/year.
This equates to 2.54 million GJ/year, and 424,725 tonnes of CO2/year.
At $100/MWh, this electricity would cost $70,712,000/year.
If the dreams of Bitcoin proponents are realized, and the currency is adopted for widespread commerce, the power demands of bitcoin mines would rise dramatically.

Are you really suggesting that "the government" fabricated those chatlogs?
@_date: 2015-05-30 11:16:37
A true "bright" mind indeed ...
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:20:45
Yes I can read, thanks.What you wrote was basically " the government can't be trusted" which implicates that they somehow "cheated" according to you , no?
@_date: 2015-05-31 09:02:17
^i really can't tell wether that's comedy or a real comment.

Yeah it seems selling herion online just makes you an instant saint in bitcoinland.
@_date: 2015-05-30 09:47:33
I agree, but you used logic, 
which is something that bitcoinerz have been known to reject...

It's also unconstituional to create  a black market drug selling site, but that doens't seem to bother you at all..
@_date: 2015-05-31 09:13:20
LOl do you actually believe that?
He wanted to get rich as fast as possible selling drugs FFS... what a fucking hero!

Quote from that transcript




But I guess to most apologists here those transcripts were all fabricated, amarite?....
@_date: 2015-05-30 10:07:50
Are you talking about Ross's parents for failing to teach him that running black market drug selling sites is kinda frowned upon?
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:20:34
because he used Bitcoin... 
no fucks would be given AT ALL if it had nothing to do with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-05-31 06:44:05
LOL...If you cannot trust what they say, then you suspect them of foul play or tampering with evidence, that's how logic works, you idiot.
Just suspend the Law all together everyone, the goverment can't be trusted...a user on reddit said so!
If what you seem to "think" is actually true, then I suggest you or DPR's parents sue the government...

More like: "I tried to make butloads of money selling illegal shit online and thought i would get away with it, i even hired people to do assasination hits on other people who "only wanted to provide a safe space to sell illegal drugs over the internet, but to some idiots i'm still a role-model"

Oke i've read the study (done by elsevier, and thus not really a "study") you've linked, so far the most significant I can get from it is this:


Furthermore, if the ease of cryptomarket purchase increased
overall drug market transactions by this group, or
provided additional drug supply to wider drug market networks
net harm from switching to cryptomarkets **may increase overall compared with conventional**drug markets. 
So claiming "it made the drug trade far safer" is a bit of a stretch.
Defending Ross Ulbright's silk road with that flimsy argument is IMHO just not acceptable.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:29:37
Lol, really? Care to link to those studies?  (if you actually believe that then you are borderline delusional)
Perhaps this might be enlighting for you:
small quote from those transcripts:


Lives in an apartment near White Rock Beach Age: 34 City: White Rock Province: British Columbia **Wife + 3 kids**
This is what you are defending really?
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:21:22
Still can't find anywhere in these "studies" that Ross Ulbricht actions on silk road made the drug trade any safer (which was the original argument here)
