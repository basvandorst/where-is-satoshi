No. Hodlers are just trying to wait till the right price to sell.
@_date: 2019-07-24 23:10:26
If you're a hodler, you're a trader. Because what other purpose is it to hold on to a "currency"?
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:52:33
Also the whole yknow education is an actual asset that **can** set you up for a lifetime of success, while the other is just a cryptocurrency on the brink of being a traded commodity.

Uh...does he not realize that the Russian banking system is *just as* if not *more* corrupt? 
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:40:20
Avoiding the topic. 
Niiiiiiiiice. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:20:54
Oh? So you want the government to get out of the way of regulating derivatives, credit default swaps, mortgage backed securities, shadow banking, margins, etc?
Idiots. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:50:25
1) nothing they did was illegal 
2) Dodd-Frank
3) Glass-Steagall
4) Gramm-Leach-Bliley act removing Glass-Steagall act
5) you've never taken a single finance class in you're life, obviously. You have no idea what you're talking about. 
6) shadow banking regulation
7) CDS clearing houses 
8) Go spend a week reading these acts and what effects they have on their institutions. 
9) You're a kid.

Just don't go wearing Make Bitcoin Great Again hats or you'll get pepper sprayed!
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:25:02
Because dumping 30 million in a single second would cause nothing wrong. /s
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:29:32
Stop listening to people who spout that "today is the best day" bullshit. 
Please do actual DD and learn what you're buying, where it's growing, where it's declining, what's being worked on currently, etc. 
Just throwing your money away based on **speculation** of "today is the day!"  will get you fucked. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:13:44
Thanks again for ignoring everything I said. :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:34:06


I've read it, so I know whats in it. Also, you can "take a peek" with amazon and clearly see it's pretty factual. Do some research first, bruh. It's basic math. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:10:15
Not really. There have been proven scientific measures to judge markets. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:56:42
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:28:32
Doesn't work like that. Go add up all the hourly volume of those exchanges and tell me what % of that 30 million would account for. Then, go google flash sales/flash crashes. Following that, do some critical thinking. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:21:48
To the moon?
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:05:42
Sooo...welcome to trading, kid. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:33:14
Way to deflect his comment ;)
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:47:11
You offer nothing in return kid; just parroting off things you read on the FAQ of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:42:36
Crystal clear on basic concepts that offer no solutions?  
Oh man! Decentralized freedom!!! Woohoo! Parroting basic shit doesn't mean you're so "enlightened". Not including you all offer no alternative method or benefit to 8 billion people. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:38:47
Lol again, complete misdirection. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:21:55
Exactly. You haven't provided one ounce of shit in any of your comments. Just escape cards back to the people calling you out. 
Fyi: Using Wikipedia and picking some fallacies doesn't mean you're free from a retort.
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:13:42
Lol I only fear at how silly you are making yourself for purposely avoiding my question.
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:55:47
Lol what's the % of whales that own the majority of bitcoin Again? ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:01:42
Is that how "freedom" works? Your whole argument is destroyed by 1 simple question of mine?
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:59:32
 Funny thing is you refuse to answer mine
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:57:29
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:17:48
JPM wasn't "bailed out"...
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:06:14
Nope. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:03:18
Did you just discover Wikipedia? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:08:15
I pity your faith in a centralized item wearing a facade 
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:47:42
Again, just parroting a simple line. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:16:43
 Avoidance and deflection. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:20:47
Bitcoin =\= block chain though. Block chain tech doesn't need Bitcoin to be successful. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:43:31
Not really. Looking forward, all the major banks, brokers, retailers, commerce, ports, etc have seen the benefits of block chain and the potential. If Bitcoin were to be wiped out tomorrow, block chain would still see significant investment.
