Thank you, I'll re-submit my post because I messed up with my title.

~~The main downside of this service is that you can only issue an USD debit card, no EUR. Apart from that the verification of my account was very quick.~~
~~**EDIT**: After creating a virtual mastercard you can't load it a second time, you are stuck with the initial amount loaded at the first time.~~
**EDIT² : Don't use them, their virtual mastercard got suspended:

You can load your plastic &amp; virtual mastercard (issued by Wavecrest) using Bitcoin or from a cryptocurrency exchange(exmo): 
I tested that today and it's working great. 
Please note that non-European accounts will get their debit card blocked by the 10 January 2018. It's announced on the control panel.

It only concerns VISA cards and not mastercard cards.

I don't think there is a limit for the amount of virtual mastercards that you can create BUT you can load only up to $2,500 max for each virtual mastercard according to the [FAQ](

I wish someone could do the same for the Bitpay's open source wallet, Copay, by forking it and adding Segwit to it.

Thank you! I was looking for this type of widget because there were only Bitcoin widget for KDE 4.
The widget works great on the desktop but not on the taskbar: 
**EDIT**: I submitted an issue about that:

No it's only for Plasma 5. If you need a similar extension for Gnome you can find it here:

Thank you, I hoped that I could find an open source app that supports fingerprint. After a few researchs I found that Breadwallet (which is open source) supports the ability to unlock the wallet with a fingerprint but this wallet doesn't have so much features, for example it doesn't provide the ability to associate a memo with a transaction.

You can check the number of Segwit transaction per block by clicking on "TRANSACTIONS(SEGWIT)" then clicking twice on the curve.
In summary:
1. 
2. 
3. 
PS: I know it's not intuitive.

Mycelium supports fingerprint only on IOS, I couldn't find any settings about the ability to lock my wallet using my fingerprint on Mycelium android version.

Is blockchain.info wallet support Segwit?

You are a god! Can I have access to this Google spreadsheet so I can add others services?

Look at the first pic at the bottom, it says 869Gb used on  916Gb : "869G/916G".

I don't think you will have enough space available, the size of the `.bitcoin` directory is 191Gb and you only have around 50Gb left on your hard drive. 
Moreover you will have soon others issues because the raspberry pi is not powerful at all.
