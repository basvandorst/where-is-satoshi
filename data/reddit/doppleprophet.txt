if I were defending racism I would have said completely different things.  What I am arguing against is calling things racism which are not.  Your ad hominems have no power over me.

You are full of crap.  The cartoon says "when the Zionists and global elites establish their new world order."  Again, not a racist slur.  Sorry.  Nothing to do with racist and not even a slur.  Do you ever get tired of being wrong?


No it wasn't.  I didn't make an ad hominem attack on you.  Learn what it means before you try to use the term.  It means an attack on the speaker instead of their argument.  My use of "clownish" (I assume is the source of your butthurt) was mocking your argument which is the opposite of ad hominem.

i dunno, I see it as the knight's mind not prepared to comprehend the answer he received, so he just walked away, still befuddled.  The dragon still has his hoard.

No idea what you're on about,--my comment was in refernce to your clownishly equating discussing Zionism with racism.  Stop calling everything racism.  It's not helping you.

The poster here ("hodlers be like") is drawing parallel.  The cartoonist/comic itself did not.

Zionist in what context?  In the context of their being over-represented in the corridors of power?  Seems to me more like an observation than "racist slur."  Zionism is not a race, any more than Muslim or Mexican is a race.
If you state a generalization involving an ethnic group, and it happens to be FALSE, is it a racist comment?
And what if it happens to be TRUE?

I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IT
