I wonder how much BTC is needed to make a drop like this?
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:08:26
Straight line down! Someone selling big time? How much BTC?
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:39:43
I wonder how many people will try to login with doge and password MuchPassword as in the image, lol

The exchanges are dealing with DDOS attacks.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:55:13
The fast rise concerns me yes but i don't think it'll drop below 1000 in the upcoming days. More and more people are hopping on to buy some coins.

This is what bitcoin does to PBOC -&gt;

2 for long storage and 1 for free spending :)

Hard to believe yes but if you do the maths you will see how many different combinations there are. Millions if not trillions.

Maybe i'm missing something here but why would we help speed up the process for a collision of an ecryption method which bitcoin uses?

Well done OP. I just purchased my 3rd ledger nano s. I advice anyone with 1 or more btc to buy one.
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:51:04
Very good explanation! Cheers!
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:22:23
I just had a transaction not being confirmed for over 11 hours (0.4 BTC). It had a fee of $0.27. I finally was able to put it in the ViaBTC Accelerator and 10 minutes later it got confirmed. Now i find out my transaction got declined on the other end. (Neteller) and i'm wondering if they will credit my account or return the coins. (Bitpay)
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:57:34
Migrate -&gt; YES, come to the netherlands, so easy to buy bitcoins here :) any amount you want instant, only need a dutch bank account and phone number.
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:28:45
What was the fee you used for your transaction? If you can't input your own desired fee then i would recommend you to change wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:47:25
You need to wait. The blocks get bigger and bigger. Have you downloaded the new bitcoin core client? I was doing 1 week every 15 minutes.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:48:00
This wat you looking for? 
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:05:00
Close, don't forget the different positions of words, oh yeah and you still need to remove and add some other words. Good luck! :)
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:37:20
Then you would have to look into mining but then again that will costs you way more money than if you would just buy bitcoins.
You could also have a look on

Best answer

Converting fiat into satoshis is the best way.

I done a couple of transactions with my ledger nano s. Last week i payed $0.50 for a high transactie fee, today i payed $0.30 for high transaction fee. Transactions got confirmed within 15 minutes, the first got confirmed within 2 minutes!

Which European Country? Anything is possible, be creative.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:01:21
Depends, if you used an online wallet then you can mostly use the "Forgot" function. Like at blockchain.info you can put in your email address to retrieve your wallet-identifier. If you  get an email of blockchain.info with your identifier than you know that's the wallet. Be creative :)

You need to BUY BTC with your BCC, so yes go to trading &gt; BTC/BCC Trade -&gt; Buy BTC -&gt; click on the amount that you have shown on the page -&gt; Trade.

You will get your coins if everything is valid, no worries. Just takes a bit longer. Feels a bit worrying if it takes a while but they are legit.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:49:11
I got 3 ledger nano s since a half year. No regret yet. Go for it you wont be disappointed :)
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:51:07
Also you need to verify every transaction on your ledger nano s. So even for example if a hacker gets in your pc while your ledger nano s is connected then he cant steal your coins because you need to verify the transaction on the ledger nano s.

@_date: 2017-07-09 22:30:07
Really like this idea! 
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:47:10
Simple answer: yes. You send coins to a btc address associated to your device.

Love these posts. Would be nice to add some more text to your posts about the predictions. Looking forward to more analysis of you! Sounds like you know how to predict the charts:) I give you gold :)

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
