Thanks so much. This is how I'm sure a lot of us are feeling right now. If anybody can help with a solution involving Bitcoin based financing it would be greatly appreciated.

Fantastic answer, but I think the trends should be reversed: Buy mining equipment when Bitcoin is "dipping", and buy luxury items when it's "not dipping." Just my two-bits.

Dear Blockchain.info - please, please, please fix some of the bugs in the new app when creating a new wallet. Where can I submit bug reports?
Thanks :)

Hopefully the increased use of digital currencies results in the increased awareness of current security issues.
@_date: 2014-09-06 09:38:43
Thanks for that. It is unfortunate because I would pay a bit more for the metal one. Hopefully they will start producing them again.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:22:32
Do you accept Bitcoin for toe deliveries via Paypal?
@_date: 2014-10-15 20:30:06

It's great to see such fast implementation! Just one more question, why did you pick Tilt over Kickstarter or Indiegogo?
Thanks again for the film and I will be contributing with Bitcoin.
* Tilt should consider an easy Bitpay integration as well. A 'Tilt' won't happen if Bitcoin isn't included.

Some of my first thoughts as an early BETA tester:
- Reputable-ish.
- No two factor authentication.
- No FIAT withdrawals.
- Easy interface for beginners.

For those of you from the future scrounging up some old bitcoin prices... The current price at time of post: 475USD/BTC .

This would be an incentive because the international shipping costs make it more expensive to purchase from Overstock.com over some other local vendor.
