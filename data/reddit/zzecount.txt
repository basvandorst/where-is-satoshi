 does make a notable point that may be the issue but the the topic was closed before I could reply, he said, 'There is a reason why we do not use BIP39 seeds; we do this to protect users. You should stay away from BIP39 wallets. Among other issues, BIP39 seed phrases lacks a version number. Without a version number, there is no way to know which address derivation method should be used. It is not a problem today, because they all use BIP44. However, when wallets start to use to new derivation methods (such as SegWit, or Schnorr signatures), there will be a problem. BIP39 does not address the issues of future compatibility.'
So might be due to the fact I use the default derivation which it says to leave unchanged m/44'/0'/0' but I'm not certain how users are expected to retrieve funds despite being told to to keep the worded phrase safe and then you use it and it doesn't work because you haven't used the wallet in a long time.

Hi  I'm discussing this with someone else directly related to the software I was using that caused the issue. 
The older version I was using made me save a 12-worded phrase and many other users related in exactly the same issue confirmed this fact but surprisingly in the latest 3.0.5 version it also makes you save a 12-worded phrase so it has to be another problem we're not clearly aware of.

ghost43 - ok, so as I said on reddit I believe, there is no point in trying with the bip39 option; seeds generated by Electrum do not use that standard (ironically because recovery is sometimes problematic for those seeds)
I am fairly certain that you have written down your seed incorrectly
ghost43 - are _all_ the words in that list?
Thanks for your help I probably messed up somewhere but I can't see where I could have gone worng, honestly.
ghost43 - I can recommend this guy based on very positive community feedback who can try to recover your wallet for you for a cut:

Hi  thanks so much for the reply. 
I basically create a new wallet, then select 'Create a standard wallet', then select 'I already have a seed' then before entering the seed phrase, I select Option and check 'BIP39 seed' after which next to options box it displays 'BIP39 (checksum: failed) with the seed phrase box still empty.
I continue to enter the seed and every time I do, the bit in the brackets (checksum: failed) it displays 'unknown wordlist' but then switches back to (checksum: failed) I still continue entering the full 12-words and after selecting next it says, 'Enter your wallet derivation here. If you are unsure what it is, leave this field unchanged' which I leave unchanged (it displays - m/44'/0'/0' - if you was curious)
It then asks me to enter and confirm password and encrypt wallet file - it generates the wallet but doesn't display my funds.
