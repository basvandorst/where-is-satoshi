If you dont get out now you are an idiot. It has gone up multiple 1000s within just 2 days.
The crash will be bad.

This is why people say HODL.

BTC used to go up 1k every few weeks, not it's gone up 3k in just a few days. Then we also get this news. Whether this news is good or bad in a technical sense really doesn't matter.
Why? Well, the only reason BTC has exploded is because of public belief in it. The FOMO effect. This news is bound to be part of an anti-BTC shill campaign and all it takes is a small drop to lead to a crash.
If you don't withdraw your BTC into fiat for a few days at this point, you are playing with fire.

Probably not. OP lives paycheck to paycheck on 50-75k per year. OP clearly is a retard when it comes to money.

I envy your naivety. Bless your ignorant heart.
Do you really think you are the first man to think that numbers are irrelevant? 41% also thought that way.
I hope you wake up to reality one day, because if you not you will end up feeling so much pain when your whole false reality falls apart around you.

I envy your naivete. 
Monogamy for the most part doesn't exist anymore in today's society. In 2017, whoever cares less in a relationship wins. People don't give 2 shits about the title of marriage. 
We have been told his wife is unhappy and unsatisfied. Now suddenly she will have an option to be financially free and chase another job/man if she simply divorces him. Most people will take the short term path out of depression rather than staying loyal and working through the tough times slowly.
What a sad time we are in, but this is the truth of the matter.

- 60 percent of second marriages end in divorce.
- 73 percent of third marriages end in divorce.
[Source]( 
41% of 1st marriages end in divorce. How is that secure? Would you go to a college where 41% of students drop out? Or would you drive a car if you had 41% chance of crashing?
Even if it was 25% like you claim, that is absurd to call it secure.
