It's going to be science or academics that even has access to the first computers that will be remotely capable of cracking this.  It will never be to the point where Joe Hacker can go and buy a quantum computer and the algorithm hasn't changed.....

For one, Bitcoin will never deny your application.

It seems like all 95% of this sub cares about is the price.  What the real enthusiasts (like those in Rise &amp; Rise) care about is the technology.  
It's laughable, in every "merchant XYZ is now accepting bitcoin" thread you can count on "THIS IS A GAME CHANGER!" hype.  No, no it's not, get real.  
Thinking a bunch of people are going to run off and do research on Bitcoin just because it's offered as a payment method alongside Visa is just folly.  They don't go out and research payment methods   or  because number  works, so why on earth would they go and research

What's this got to do with bitcoin?  I thought it had it's own coin - Storjcoin X (SJCX).  
Oh I see, spam the busy crypto forum for some publicity.

With Bitcoin the user pays a fee when paying and the merchant pays a fee when they want fiat....

I pay $0 fee to use Visa and Uber though.  And it doesn't require any capital to be locked up ahead of time.

You could have a crypto sale without a purchase.  The card sells the crypto but for some reason after that point the transaction is cancelled.  You now have a Fiat balance on the card.  
With the coinbase one it sounds like that couldn't happen.

If BTC volume is propped up because of tether volume, that's not good for BTC.  We want real user demand and adoption, not tether demand.  That could cause some major panic.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:20:53
Transactions have to get processed somehow though.

You're simply confusing volatility for something it's not.
With your logic no car purchase is ever possible because whatever currency is used could have instead be used to buy BTC.

Correct but he said stop because of regulations.  That's more of what I was referring to.

Your net worth is impacted the same regardless of payment method.

I use Electrum wallet on my phone to send and receive Bitcoin.  Instead of running a node, it's a lightweight client that connects to a server that has the whole blockchain downloaded (because the server runs a node).  Nice people that run the servers help out users like me that need a lightweight client on their phones.  I think the desktop version of it might be lightweight too, not sure.

Ok but if Bitcoin is banned by 10 major countries, yes it still does what it does but has it lost value to any people?  People assign a value to BTC.  And people will look at all the moving parts.

Your example doesn't apply in the same manner.    
Of the 21M there's probably only 15M available (I'm not into crypto anymore so that's simply a guess from my readings last year)..  As each day passes (not including mining), the available number should only decrease as wallets are lost.  Technically each available Bitcoin becomes a higher % of all bitcoins each passing day (again excluding mining).  In other words you own 4 BTC of 15M available today and that may be 4 BTC of 14.5M available by this time next year.   
Your example would most likely be 2M already available BTC which is why there wouldn't be an impact.

Start at Coinbase then move on to Brain Wallet.

It's an additional currency.  There are something like 180 currencies in existence right now. I would rather own Bitcoin than most of those.  Bitcoin is not contained by borders like most currencies are.
Question for you, what exactly does government-backed currency mean to you?
@_date: 2019-09-05 13:30:31
That site has been around for years.  It used to be pretty common in 2017 for mainstream media to write articles declaring "Bitcoin is dead" for whatever stupid reason.  Mostly every time there was a huge dip which was common.

Hackers nowadays can even call 9-1-1 and make it look like it came from your phone number.  It happened to one of the earliest guys in Bitcoin, Hal Finney.

Yeah.  
Looking at a $2800 46" TV bought in 2008.  $400 buys just as good if not a better TV today.

You can only uses losses to offset gains in gambling.  In other words, if the IRS somehow knows about your gambling wins, you can use these losses to lessen your total won and reduce your taxes owed on gambling wins.  
Typically the IRS would need to receive a W2-G in order to know about any gambling wins unless you're a good person and reporting all gambling wins.

What's stopping Bitcoin 2 from starting up in 2014 and adding coins into the existing Bitcoin system?  
As a comparison think of U.S. currency that gets printed every year and added to the money supply.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:40:49
Are those all using the bitcoin source?
