Can anyone suggest a good 5-10 minute video(s) covering this information?

Perhaps. I personally am buying it to store value and plan to cash out at a later date when the price has risen sufficiently for my needs.
If I were to want to purchase goods and services I'd look to something like LTC, a MUCH more stable price with plenty of redundancy built in for high tx volume.
I for one would prefer if more businesses became aware of LTC and more accepting due mainly to its stability but also for the inherent utility. I'm quite happy for BTC to remain as isfor larger purchases / investments etc.

With the biggest and most publicised exchanges touting BTC and not BCH (thus far) I'd suggest otherwise.
Also, are people today buying for the utility of purchasing or for store of value? IMO it's the latter and so there is no rush to fix the supposed problems that BCH solves. I say supposed as with patience you can get low tx fees.
More and more people are going to buy BTC and trade of HODL.

Fair enough, I missed his tone at the end there. Apologies.

Coinbase are signed up for segwit2x so their wallets are not safe.
Move your coins out if you want to be in full control come November

Yep, quick read of the article will confirm just that.

As do coinbase and bitstamp (and doubtless others).
The bitlicense is a barrier to entry in the New York market, not a complete block.

That is one method for sure. This site will get you going

Choose another wallet that lets you choose a custom fee. TX fees are no longer a problem, your choice of wallet is.

Unnecessary aggression?
Bitstamp have managed to adopt segwit so why are these other exchanges lagging so far behind?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:33:56
Done. Would be very interested to see the results.

Create a gdax account, move coins there for free and then out of there for free.
Then close your coinbase account and use another exchange
