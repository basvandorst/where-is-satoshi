What scares me is how much tether is being pumped into circulation. $400 million this week. Could possibly pump/ crash the market. We hodlers won't stand a chance.

How is Coinbase insured?
Aug 11, 2017    
Digital Currency
All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft.
Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage.
This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase and GDAX.
 
Fiat Currency
Coinbase stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in segregated, custodial bank accounts. The funds held in those accounts belong to Coinbase’s customers - not to Coinbase. 
If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000.
Even if Coinbase were to become insolvent, the funds held in the custodial bank accounts could not be claimed by Coinbase or its creditors. The funds held in those accounts would be returnable to Coinbase’s customers.

What a load of bull crap. You’re saying that google promotes information that isn’t accurate and isn’t to blame for it. They need to accountable for the inaccurate/ wrong information they spread, being the most used search engine in the world. They’re turning into Facebook. They need to regulate information they promote. 
What really grinds my gears tho is when a layman searches or expresses interest in bitcoin, googles it, and learns that roger ver is the ceo, only to look him up and end up buying bch, that scam of shitcoin fork, instead of btc.
So yeah, to reiterate, fuck google, and those guys in particular.
