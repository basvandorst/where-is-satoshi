It makes it a safer speculation/investment. Governments can't argue it's only used for drugs and illegal stuff now. 
Right now it's still early, but it's possible for companies to pass on their savings by offering discounts when paid in bitcoins, decent incentives. 
Companies who regularly trade money back and forwards to each other could use bitcoins to save transfer fees.

Can we stop saying this? Simply untrue. The total number of coins, assuming they made $500,000 is less than 1000 coins. Even if it was 2000 coins, the market isn't going to take such a large dip. This assumes there are less than 2000 coins bought on the news.

I don't agree, no. Dogecoin is not too different from litecoin, more or less copy and paste with a tweak of some variables. Litecoin fixed the unlimited issue, dogecoin didn't. Heck namecoin at least is unique. Zerocoin will be. Dogecoin is not. I don't see anything except more coins.
Sure I have nothing to lose, so what you want, just stop spamming and leave us alone. It's like religion, I don't care, just don't spread your crap here. 
Edit: my opinion of the price. It will go down further. Speculation is what keeps bitcoin up high, more so with dogecoin. Speculators are leaving, the price won't hold as millions of coins enter, simple supply and demand.

A couple of tips but no mention of it anywhere. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:05:08
There aren't really signs that point to a ban from governments, if anything, quite the opposite. So far the us gov has not been too negative on bitcoin based on previous hearings. Us companies are accepting bitcoins. The argument that it's only for drugs and illegal activity doesn't hold water anymore. The Feds are planning to sell bitcoins. Can you imagine a company buying them and then the us gov banning them? 
Over in Europe has been quite positive too with governments looking for ways to tax it rather than banning them.
China's official stance is not a ban. Regardless if how you interpret it. If I was wealthy and living in China, I would buy bitcoins before the ban so I can withdraw them overseas. Say there is a millionaire who wants to get his money out or china, wouldn't he buy bitcoins off someone in China?

An address can be generated offline with a private key 
You send coins to this address.
You can view it on the network.
You access it by putting in your private key.
Question: how does the network know the address even though it's offline? 
Answer: I'll let someone else answer 
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:11:35
You need an easier entry with regards to the law before more companies/businesses get involved. Coinbase spent quite a large amount of capital in doing this. They (from the hearings) would not mind harder entry to this market so they can remain on top. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:48:29

Can we start banning these? You can do what you want with doge, just don't post it here. This is . 
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:19:35
This is good news, bitcoin style haha. Just kidding. But hear me out.
Regardless of what they say, speculators are not stupid. Having unlimited doge in the future drives speculators away. I feel as though they are so deep into the culture of doge they are deluded. They think 5billion a year is good news. In 19 years after the planned 100billion, they will have 200billion! 
Firstly, they argue that this will not matter as the number of lost coins increases. Really? 5 billion coins a year is well enough for lost coins. And even if that many coins are lost, does it matter? They have decimal places. 
They then say it's an incentive for miners. Somewhat stronger argument but still fails. Doge takes off as a currency, then heaps of transactions happen and the value increases. The fees will add up and if miners don't profit, they may stop mining and it becomes more profitable as more drop out. Slightly less secure but nothing too drastic. If it doesn't take off, then mining air is still mining air. 
Deflationary encourages hoarding and prevents spending. Bullshit. We now know as the price of bitcoin increases, people spend more. If it cost 1 coin to buy a laptop, you may not. But if it cost 1/10th of a coin, you are more likely. The sales number reflect that if I recall correctly. 
Another is copied and pasted often is how bitcoin is more inflationary during xx years. It's true, but what about this year? What about years after the cherry picked 4 years. That's like me saying doge has a higher inflationary rate in year 2200-29999+. 
To say bitcoiners are greedy? Please! Just because we don't give pennys around doesn't make us so. There has been many charitable work done by the community. 
The price of doge has tanked since the news and will continue to do so. They now have to resort to more marketing and spamming to promote their coin, hoping to get make up the price drop since speculators left. Strong community, but no real value.

No. Tell me how many bitcoins are mined everyday? How many people are accepting bitcoin and keeping it? How many buy bitcoins are bought with wages. How many are instantly converting fiat to money straight away?

Possible, bit of a stretch and don't forget the total sales for the first 17 hours or so were $250,000. Let's assume half were to buy miners with half coming from litecoins.  ~$60,000 = ~3000 ltc. I'm sure 3000ltc won't cause ltc to drop. If I had to guess, it's due to people selling for other coins.

The halving is something everyone knew, from day 1. It's similar to what I've previously said about a company expecting to make xx profit. Significantly less the share price goes down. 
Investors/speculators thought there will only ever be 100b coins mined. Now that the news said there will be 5b extra a year, 200b after 20 years, the market is adjusting the price according to this information, hence price drop. 
Correct they don't like inflation. Halving reduces inflation, and investors like that. They don't however, like the removal of the cap.

@_date: 2014-01-21 09:16:35
Btc has a much larger picture/view, we are talking about potentially a trillion dollar market. Stuff is serious, and serious development is underway. How can the world take btc seriously f we aren't serious. This doesn't mean we can't have fun on the way. 
If fun and short term is what you want, by all means...

It won't matter too much but definitely annoying reading about it in bitcoin subs. Their idea of promoting which they convince themselves is donating and giving is to spam tips everywhere. It makes it more like a scheme where they recruit people by spamming whatever they can in hopes for a price rise.

Most interesting part to me is considering the option of bitcoin payment to staff salary, possibly as bonuses too. 
This is big, the beginning of creating a whole self sustaining ecosystem.

Merchants reported themselves previously. To say doge intended inflationary is silly and shows how bad the developers are. It was 100 bill, no matter how you twist it. No more after that. It wasn't included but that was what was intended.

Interesting, even after this article you did not admit to being caught, I'm slowly starting to believe. Still skeptical, but less.

The sell off was from huobi before any other exchange, on decent volume, so it's definitely China.

This is similar to saying one price for all petrol/gas around the world. Doesn't quite work that way. Bitcoin will present itself arbitrage opportunities if the gap is too wide.

Beauty is time will tell who is right. Perhaps state how it is being sugar coated? More or less China is saying this will not be a currency. Surely, we can't expected RMB to be replaced by bitcoins or having dual official currency right? I understand if they said we will ban bitcoins, then the price can hover around 200-400, but they did not.

For those who don't understand, some "random" methods may lack entropy (most don't)(not random enough). So by rolling these dice, a random passphrase can be generated without using a computer. 
The idea is there really isn't such thing as random.

Pretend you have 100,000 coins. Do you want a crash? Why does everything think because some guy has xxx,xxx bitcoins, he can and will crash the market. Even if he/she does, it will recover and never happen again.

Does it matter if your bitcoin is worth more in future if you wouldn't have had it anyway if you left it in fiat?

I watched it. Gist: he thinks it's possible to take over bitcoin, but not likely. Sees it as a silver to bitcoin's gold. Side by side rather than a competitor. Agrees that not knowing who created bitcoin makes it 'better'. Threat to bitcoin is regulations/ban but doesn't think it's likely. Decent video, 4 mins, 6.8/10.

Evidence for fiat to be 10million? Sure sounds like an average 20-24 year old with maybe 40k.

Summary: Bitcoin fell below 500 after hearing China's problems but increased over 80% since then. Btcchina is slightly lower due to deposit issues, but the top few exchanges are around $720. This could mean despite the problems in china, bitcoin is somewhat resilient and strong. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:41:44
This is pretty much as expected. We can't expected china to say we will replace our currency for bitcoin. To stop things getting out of hands, they basically said you can do whatever, but not on the scale the effect our economy that is beyond our control. It is interesting as the market cap was/is around 10billion, they see the potential and decide to control where it could blow up (via banks), so they decided to issue the notice. 
Money laundering will still be done in china via bitcoin, but probably in combination with overseas techniques. The news may appear bad at first, but people will realise later on this is indeed acceptable.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:21:55
Did you expect china to say its a legal currency? It will replace rmb? What if the us for said it won't replace the usd as legal currency or btc won't be a legal currency?

@_date: 2013-12-23 14:34:46
Why does it seem like every time you buy prices go down, you sell it goes up? 
Simple fear and greed is how the market operates. We all know to buy low sell high but rarely do we do it. We get scared when everyone is selling and go along with it. We buy when everyone else is. We think they know something we don't. The smart traders and whales know all this and play it out as so you lose. If you don't know your stuff, have a plan and stick to it. For newbies, it's better to buy and hold and focus on the fundamentals.

Truth is, it's rather cheap with a small market cap. Why is it expensive compared to previously? People simply buying and holding realising the value.
Other answers: china buying, more use as more places accept it. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:19:09
It's not like they are ever going to straight up say "buy!". No country has done that. No corporation has done that.

Not without a risk. Put yourself in their shoes and it becomes clear. You try to cause a crash but a big whale buys them all, what do you do now?

So may be the guy who bought 10 or 1000. Each person has a different threshold. Lots to you may not be to others. I'm estimating the average person here has less than 20?

My response: For those confused, this is what it is. Many services already have a similar feature. You put your bitcoins on the btcchina on a code. You sell the code. The person that buys it loads the code on btcchina. They now have btc on the exchange. That is all.

That is it, people will slowly leave china with bitcoins. At the same time, the government does not want to make it illegal. Its good they straight up said its fine if you guys still want to trade it. By the time they want to ban it, it will be too big. I wonder if we will see it banned in our lifetime.
