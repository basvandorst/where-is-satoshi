The size of Bitcoin blockchain is getting bigger, same as any other blockchain. Every blockchain is dependent and cannot be penetrated! Altcoins' blockchain has high security, more than any database in the world.

Theoretically Bitcoin has a fixed supply and is a deflationary currency! The fact is that it declined to $300 from $1200 in 2013. Then It skyrocketed to over $450 level  just in recent months! Most Ppl now probably tend to save Bitcoin rather to spend it! We don't know when the price will decline. It is very volatile. Hoarding Bitcoin is risky!
