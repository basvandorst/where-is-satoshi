You could write a dirty prototype that implements its core functions in a few days. Its not rocket science
@_date: 2015-06-13 19:19:11
yeah I agree, its a non persistent and temporary layer
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:51:54
that would be environmental impact, miners make a profit so its not really expensive. Also its not the banks expense, if a bank wants to create a bitcoin app then they dont have to pay for mining...
she reminded me of the mastercard guy

I agree, it is impossible to predict. but 40 years is a very long time when talking about software adoption

Lighting network could be described as a "negotiation of value transfer" payment channel, once the final payment amount has been agreed, the blockchain is then used to settle and complete the payment.
If the transactions never reached the blockchain then it might as well have never taken place
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:06:41
lmao, its just so true. people are so dumb.
lets all migrate to @_date: 2015-06-07 20:34:55
I dont see why they would require bigger blocks. lightning doesnt care what you do with the transactions, all is cares about is the final settlement figure you transmit to the blockchain, in fact it doesnt need to ever know that it was a LN tx

bitcoin is created when a block is found. the amount that a miner can assign to themselves in the block is 25BTC, if you changed that value to anything other than 25BTC, the block would be rejected by the network and the miner gets nothing.
Play by the rules and you get rewarded, try and screw the system and you will fail and lose

side-chains allow atomic transactions between two blockchains, the lightning network sits on top of bitcoin.
I think side-chains *will* materialise because they add extra value, for example storing files or references.
@_date: 2015-06-06 09:43:51
It uses the bitcoin blockchain and the bitcoin network, you buy with bitcoin and you cash out with bitcoin... how much more bitcoin can you get?
None more, none more bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:49:23
really interesting
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:33:01
Kinda, blocks are still rewarded with 25btc, far greater than the tx fees. And no it wont make it less secure, they still need to be finalised in the block chain
@_date: 2015-06-05 09:39:40
Hmmmm, sounds like semantics to me. One can be as philosophical as one likes but at the end of the day, its a publicly shared file(s) that contains user-defined data stored in the OP_RETURN, In the context of getting access to pedo porn, the blockchain does give a massive advantage in stealthiness and criminal deniability.
The content and location of the data defines its legal status. blockchain or no blockchain
on a side note: i dont see how two different images would have the same "bit pattern" a decoded image is a matrix of colours represented as bytes.

really nice idea, users should be reminded that they are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks. if you include your email address and an 8 letter word it could be brute forced in a very short amount of time.
A high number of email addresses have been stolen from various pools over the years and targeting these would be a very effective route to discovering private keys
@_date: 2015-05-05 08:09:50
Exactly my thoughts, the idea that i could get held at knife-point and ordered to clear out my account is scary.

Some napkin maths here, but on a trading volume of 1,119,748,745, and a bitcoin tx fee of $0.03, that would equate to $33,592,462.35 per day in fees.
Of course this presume High frequency trading which may not be possible and not using off chain tech like lightning network

thank you kind sir
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:58:34
No offence but you clearly don't work in software. For a start this test is to see how blocks are mined and distributed in a high volume scenario, the problem in question is the amount of memory that hashing requires on large blocks(As discussed by Gavin Andresen). Litecoins implements scrypt, which was chosen in an attempt to be ASIC resistant by deliberately making the amount of memory it uses extremely high.
So why would we test the memory utilisation for the bitcoin network, on another network that has been  *specifically* designed to use more memory?
@_date: 2015-05-20 09:48:06
I wonder how a 1 min block time would affect litecoin
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:12:56
If this happened to bitcoin noone would give a shit. Every time something like this happens to ripple its another nail in the coffin

It has nothing to do with the actual value and everything to do with microchips running algorithms. Most money in the market is made from fools, HFT allows that  be better leveraged.

@_date: 2015-05-22 14:26:33
This is something i have thought long and hard about. I havent seen a bitcoin investment that is safe enough to put any significant amount into. Bitcoin is so cheap right now you might as well just buy them. thats what I have done

Michael Casey of the Wall Street Journal, who broke the story, confirmed as much on Twitter:
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:23:33
I think you are quite right. There is an additional angle however, and that is to not let blockchain technology be too convoluted with multiple chains. One of the reasons the PC industry was so quick was because windows created consistency, interoperability and compatibility amongst its users. A single OS made the job a lot easier. So there is an argument for everyone using the same network.
@_date: 2015-05-27 08:21:36

@_date: 2015-05-22 18:08:59

Why not Zoidberg?
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:39:01
The lightning network is a super fast, offchain transactional network that doesnt require the blockchain until the point of final settlement.
This means that transaction negotiations can take place rapidly and not clog or rely on confirmation time in order to be validated
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:14:56
more trustworthy exchange for post-moon trading
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:04:01
The one im aware of is block propagation time for miners
@_date: 2015-05-09 22:47:56
10 minute block times is a persistence issue. Even a potential 12 second block time is pushing the limits of inventive programming.

@_date: 2015-07-15 17:13:05
well satoshi accounts for 5% of that. A couple of ETF's including the winklevoss own probably another 5%, draper owns a shit load.
One would hope that once the prices goes higher some of the major speculators would liquidise, putting some of the bitcoin back into the ecosystem. 
I feel bitreserve are quite anti-bitcoin and their view in the long term is digital currency in general rather than purely bitcoin centric. Hence the constant negativities.

The technology elite have so far proved to be more philanthropic than the old money elite. maybe this is a turning point.. maybe..

Just gave the same advice to my friend yesterday. Buy now, then you are in the game
@_date: 2015-07-11 05:47:33
Thats a very good idea. I wish I could just forget about the price ad get on with my life
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:08:02
Revenue is vanity and profit is sanity
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:20:25
yeah more competition will drive prices down.

Because we all cruel hearted bastards, no-one gets out alive!

I wonder how this affects capital gains tax. Particularly if something is purchased with btc
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:19:07
I was invited to a preview a few weeks back and it was really slick. I got my bitcoin within 10 minutes. 
I spoke with the guys there and they assured me it was a live scenario and not some guy sitting in the office.
International wire transfers are a bitch and it always feels so dodgy. its a big improvement on LBC.

@_date: 2015-07-12 21:16:27
There are 50 stars on the USA flag, the USA has a GDP of 13 Trillion, therefore a bitcoin is worth $619,047 each!
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:24:43
nice, how much do the other etf/etn's own?
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:26:37
how many you got?
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:49:18
erm erm, we have over 145 users ..... erm erm
@_date: 2015-07-05 07:48:21
thats a scary thought, but he only controls a theoretical 5%
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:56:59
I beleive trezor has a hardware RNG that uses atmospheric noise to generate the key
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:38:08
Why you....!!!!
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:40:25
@_date: 2015-04-21 07:07:38
exactly. If Bitcoin gained a market cap of Trillions (as it quite well could if it were to power IoT) then your fridge might be lucky enough to able buy a few items on your grocery for free list that week.
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:07:20
sure, but in the context of a mortgage, you can rent the property and cover the mortgage. I agree that borrowing 1m would be very risky
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:44:33
They would licence their part of the chip to manufacturers.
Qualcomm arent in the space of developing hardware wallets. This could basically be a trezor in all chips
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:17:09
get a trezor
@_date: 2015-04-22 07:16:24
Well over a billion phones are sold each year so it doesnt need to take a decade.
Software wallets are not fine, they are very weak and shouldnt really be trusted in the hands of the masses. Hardware specific private key stores are far superior and are required for security.
The mesh network you suggest is far bigger an undertaking than having a chip in a phone. Look how fast gps/wifi/bluetooth chips spread, and that was many years ago when mobile was not as prevalent 
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:51:27


Can you explain how this will be profitable?
@_date: 2015-04-27 18:30:08
That and that Bitcoin is the most secured network by shere number of miners
@_date: 2015-04-29 12:39:13
Did you enter a nickname? it errored for me when i didnt
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:41:00
not 99c?
@_date: 2015-04-01 08:19:12
Possibly due to the larger whales moving less. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:51:05
Do you have a link?
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:35:52
Please forgive me 
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:44:31
in 20 years when bitcoin is worth $5m each, you are going to demolish that wall
@_date: 2015-04-13 11:45:16
Ah, i understand, the key to this is the timelock. 
thanks for the explanation
@_date: 2015-04-25 08:23:05
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:58:51
I never said I was talking about 1 bitcoin. I meant your bitcoin stash 
@_date: 2015-04-05 10:55:40
The conclusion has an error:
..and we are left with an undeniable conclusion: bitcoin will end of the nation state. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:10:46
Price is a good concideration yes. But a person who takes security seriously is probably holding more than a few btc
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:16:33
I tried is for 3 months and lent over 30BTC.
I found that you can only really make decent profit if you lending 0.5btc or more. All it takes is a couple of defaults and your profit is wiped out.
In the end I was screwed over for 1BTC by a guy who had paid back over 50 loans totalling $100k +. he went off the grid and never returned. At that point I cut my losses and left
@_date: 2015-04-29 12:39:40
me too. even tried with the +44
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:44:36
interesting, so how could this work? would it need to be designed into the OS? Can applications be signed to work with specific device hardware?
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:08:58
yeah that would be amazing and truly decentralised.
It would also put the reward money in the pockets of regular people instead of mining operations. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 15:02:48
youre wasting your life staying in on that computer

This could be a trezor style collection of chips built into Qualcomm processors. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 06:36:15
not really, what stops the payer double spending the bitcoin before the channel is closed?
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:41:38
kinda, except bitsim uses an sms layer and this chip would be available programatically via and SDK
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:41:12
Im not so sure. Imagine phone with the bitcoin logo on the box. If they keys are stored the same way as a trezor then it would be a fantasic product
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:20:59
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:07:08
Difficulty is calculated by an agreed formula. This formula derives from the number of blocks found over the last 2016 blocks. from here the average time is calculated and then difficulty is adjusted to ensure that blocks are created every 10 mins.
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:27:37
a satoshi is a unit, it does not have an id. it is merely a value within an address
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:37:21
I was there and managed to speak with one of the guys, he didnt give me much information but hinted at a home/commercial heating service generated from mining. They have heater racks that are installed into homes, with hot swapping trays that can be upgraded as the asics improve. I didnt get any more than that from him.
The idea is that mining should be more decentralised and environmentally friendly
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:20:25
I did, im no economist, but after googling I understand what you are saying. thanks for the answer. you is clever :)
@_date: 2015-04-19 18:47:14
I dont beleive you
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:39:23
I guess because its boring and wont really change anything
@_date: 2015-04-07 10:29:14
You cant use a symbol without a unicode or we wont be able to type the currency symbol for the next decade until all fonts are updated. You cant use the Baht symbol because its already taken, the first symbol is nasty. So it can only really be the second symbol

well if we presume that all computers are compromised at the hardware level. Then the only way to secure bitcoins is offline. Either a hardware wallet or paper/brain wallet.
Im not sure what bitcoin app you can build that will satisfy your requirement
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:52:47
this would be followed by "everyone close their bitcoin position tomorrow day"
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:16:50
Wouldnt the delay in the payee sending the tx to the blockchain allow the payer to perform a double spend in the interim?

I cant beleive you are talking to me like this
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:01:13
yes he owes me $650
@_date: 2015-04-26 06:04:28
I dont see what value stealing your pin and pass phrase would be. Any theft you are talking about would require both physical and remote access. 
You would only be protecting yourself against an inside job
in terms of the limitation of "keyloggers", there are no limitations, its software, if code is executing on your computer it has boundless access to everything
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:10:02
you can use the paper backup with passwords attached
@_date: 2015-04-05 14:58:40
tumblers are therefore really tumbling transactions rather than coins.
Yes, there are actually no coins, just transactions with unspent values
remember when you tumble you are might be receiving bitcoins from naughty people
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:18:10
Perhaps, but its going to take time to get there and in the mean time you may want to use your capital to fund yourself
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:11:52
*Just because bitcoin works this way does not mean it is the only valid way to use a blockchain.*
Yes I agree. However....Cant think of any other way
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:10:08
annoying apple guy
@_date: 2015-04-27 06:59:16
Thanks, im going to use the same solution on you ;)
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:17:43
tcp/ip couldnt do anything useful for the masses, then layers were built on top
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:57:47
Out of curiosity... did you take this from the joke I posted earlier?
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:43:20
exactly, but the huge upside makes it worth the risk
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:08:48

They are also working on an air conditioning mode. its called inverted asics. They have a prototype but currently its hashing POW with prefixed 1's instead of 0's. they hope to acheive zero prefixes sometime next year using heavy electricity.
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:11:14
The more IoT devices you owned, the more Bitcoin you mine
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:40:15
It wont be an altcoin, it will likely be counterparty on top of Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-10 06:37:10
hahahahha good one
@_date: 2015-04-26 13:54:36
How much bitcoin have you had stolen on how many occasions?
also how how it stolen, interested to know
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:55:36
just a joke :)
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:40:51
this is true, a recent count showed that that are only 50,000 adresses left in the world!
we need to buy more before they run out
@_date: 2015-04-30 12:42:17
didnt you mean... moonish!?
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:46:46
Whats the difference between this and Coinbase usd account? they also offer GBP too
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:39:10
It could be tainted via its previous transactions. An address isnt like a bucket where transactions can be thrown in and mixed. Each transaction that is sent to an address is held in a separate unspent state. Should a wallet then spend some of the bitcoins from the address it may use one or more transaction from that address
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:40:19
the videos were for private previewing purposes only
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:32:04
35 here

Clearly a noob, 300 is nothing
@_date: 2015-03-10 15:50:19
Me too. The guys I worked with thought it looked unprofessional to upload preview videos to youtube. So we instead build a shitty web page with JWplayer...
took a day, looked like crap.. but hey! it was professional right???
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:19:53
thats a tshirt right there!
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:25:02
yeah but its not a rachet, doesnt mean its going to stay above 300
@_date: 2015-03-04 22:05:48
You do know your investment was the worst investment of 2014! it lost 80% in one year!
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:27:48
just buy a trezor.. job done
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:37:05
you pay money and then you get nothing in return
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:37:02
thats the ugliest ATM ive ever seen
@_date: 2015-03-10 09:38:54
I just felt like I was reading my own bio. totally agree, changed my perspective of money
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:57:26
Buying bitcoin is by far the hardest thing in england. I want to buy for so many friends but I dont want random cash paid into my bank account or the tax man might get funny about it. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:13:49
yeah me too.. so unbalanced
@_date: 2015-03-28 18:48:39
Are we talking about an bi-directional comms?
Or is it just to broadcast the blockchain
@_date: 2015-03-11 10:30:22
Simpler onboarding process through banks
More merchants accepting bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-11 15:25:11

no it isnt. its 0.03
