Thank you! In answer to your questions:
- Signing is a good idea, will likely implement in the future.
- I agree the file size is big, I'm trying to figure out how to make it smaller. The actual code base is pretty small, but I'm using  to package for win and mac and that is creating a lot of overhead. As I iterate versions over time I hope to make it smaller.
- The data is coming from cryptocompare.com's API.

No way to detect or remove?

This is not a trojan miner. There has been a hacked version of this being distributed on cryptopricewidget[dot]NET which is a hacked clone.
Make sure you are downloading from the above GitHub link or  as stated in the repo.

I've become aware of a bug that when you add a new coin, you have to re-set your base currency. I will definitely be fixing this soon.
For now, add all the coins you want, and then set your base currency, and you should be good to go.
Thank you for downloading and leaving feedback!

Hmm ok, are you on Windows or Mac? I will test it out on my systems and try to figure it out.
Great suggestion, I will add that to the list :)
