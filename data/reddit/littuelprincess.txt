I am a human and i am subjective, i would definitely be more happy if i had 1 btc rather than 0.9975473
@_date: 2018-06-19 16:37:40
But are these charts considering the position of the Moon and Saturn?
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:39:26
It is not the number of addresses but the number of inputs, you can have 100 inputs on 1 adress

Bitcoin must never hard fork. Period.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:00:02
Are bech addresses strictly better? Are they fully backwards compatible?
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:33:36
You can never know for sure. Bitcoin never promised huge returns, only a decentralized peer to peer electronic cash system.
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:08:14
No, decentralization means there are many many full nodes and mining nodes being run or in other words there is no single point of failure you could exploit.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:40:46
You have any proof?

Don't use that shit wallet, it is not safe.
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:20:57
Yeah, I am really confused right now. Wasn't the whole deal with segwit that the block size will remain 1mb, but more transactions can fit in that 1mb ? What's the point of segwit2x then?

Hello, I use dutu poloLender from github, it works nice. Don't expect too much profit from lending, probably 5%ish a year.
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:53:37
Why don't you just buy your own bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:17:22
Thx for explains

What is a segwit address? How is ot diffirent from normal addresses?
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:51:47
Laughed so hard on this haha
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:28:12
Not sure can people outside Croatia use it :/
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:28:56
The local exchange i use gives you a 3 hour window to send the money, but you can still cancel the transaction. I was opening and closing transactions the whole night just so i can squeeze every satoshi I possibly can. 
TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:19:48
I hope that you are wrong hahaha xD
