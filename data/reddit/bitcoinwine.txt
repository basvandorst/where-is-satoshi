Honest question - do you get paid to post stuff like this? It looks like all you do is run this lame Dunning-Kruger joke out there to bash Bitcoin on reddit. Sad use of your time regardless, but for your sake, I guess I hope you do get paid for it.

Cool, hadn't heard of dewinespot, will check 'em out, thanks.

Fair question. It'd be amazing if one day growers, production facilities, glass mfr's, etc all too btc. You're right, though, at serious scale, staying entirely in coin wouldn't be sustainable. For the time being, though, I can cover purchases made on the site, and not transition back to dollars. I guess the original comment was a little tongue in cheek, but I'm going to do all I can, for as long as I can, to not convert back to usd. Thanks!

Thank you, sir! I spent six months in Australia (NSW/Vic) several years ago and loved every minute. Cheers!

No problem shipping to Indiana. Did you receive an error when you tried?

The diner Grenache is the bolder, richer wine of the two. The Blue Plate Grenache is a little brighter, and a very versatile wine that pairs well with any number of foods. I think you'd enjoy either, though, and that both appeal to cab/merlot drinkers. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:05:33
Absolutely, that'll be addressed soon. First step was getting the initial site up, but definitely want to make sure mobile is supported.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:51:25
Maybe at present. As mentioned, though, the intent is to begin pulling in wines from other producers.
picnicwineco.com is our winery's site, and will only ever sell our wines. I envision bitcoinwine.com becoming a hub for purchasing wines from all over the world. Fair point, though, and I see that there is a lack of distinction right now. I hope this clarifies my goal for the project. Thanks!

Appreciate the well wishes! Yeah, PA is a really tricky state with respect to alcohol laws. Thanks for your support nevertheless!
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:06:00
gotta love the internet... :)
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:02:00
Joe, definitely interested! I'll shoot you an email in the AM. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:54:18
I like it! We'll be here :)
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:12:53
This is great info, thanks. We ship through a third-party, who has IN green-lighted. State-by-state alcohol laws are such a burden to navigate, though, that I consume as much info as I can. Much appreciated, cheers!
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:54:55
Thanks, Roger!
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:45:49
Thanks so much, appreciate the support!
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:52:24
It's in the works! :)
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:07:50
USD for the foreseeable future, I'll figure out how to make price in BTC more prominent though, cheers.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:57:32
Sorry about that :(
Will do, and thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:25:55
I have been messaged privately about coupon codes, so I went ahead and created one to share with you guys to thank you for your feedback.
Today only, use **reddit** to save 10% on anything in the house.
Thanks again!
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:32:22
I know! We've got lame ones, too, though... Can't ship to 12 of our 50 states, grrrr
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:32:06
At the risk of droning on too long (too late?), the only note I'd add is that I hope this project can A) be a fantastic business venture (of course), but B) also serve as a call to action. Just like the early days of the web, there is a land grab going on right now.
If you have a product or service where you can add real value, then get to it. Don’t count on advertising or a cheesy donation button to power some copycat webapp. Find a product or develop a service that you’d honestly be happy to pay for yourself, and I think you’ll find support.
This economy is still so hungry. Let’s shut guys like [Roubini]( up. Ponzi game? This is money.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:26:08
We are, yeah, our site at [picnicwineco.com]( is up to handle conventional orders.
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:48:28
Yeah... not sure how they're pulling that off, ha!
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:03:26
It's a good question. I believe I can't refuse dollars, and I suppose I wouldn't if pressed. For the time being, all of the wines available at Bitcoinwine.com are also available at picnicwineco.com though... so as a legal entity, that option is available. When the catalog of goods on Bitcoinwine.com expands, I probably have a new question on my hands. Good food for thought! Always something that needs researching when you work in the adult beverage industry...
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:21:37
That's good feedback, thanks. Selling wine online is kind of onerous, mostly just due to the big freight charges. Selling cases makes things a little more cost-effective for everyone, but I'll look addressing smaller quantities in a way that makes sense. Out of curiosity, would a six bottle package be more compelling? Thanks again.
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:52:38
That's really generous of you! I'll take a look and reach out, thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:30:47
Hey thanks for the mention!
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:20:48
To be sure! Many thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:33:31
All states with the exceptions of AL, AK, AR, HI, KS, MD, MA, MS, NH, PA, UT, WV - dumb blue laws...
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:55:59
And no, we don't convert to fiat ;)
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:55:13
Noted, we'll get that messaged more clearly, thanks for your feedback. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:44:08
Ha, totally fair point. You could probably argue that working in Napa skews our perspective on appropriate levels of wine consumption :)
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:35:01
Thanks so much! Really glad you enjoyed and looking forward to getting our Grenache to you and the lady. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:34:22
Yeah, totally hear you. I'd like to display prices in both BTC and USD. Just a design tweak I have yet to address. I agree that's a little confusing, though. The only option on checkout is BTC, but I need to make that clearer.
Anyway, thanks for your support, much appreciated!
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:41:20
Absolutely, we've had several purchases for just that reason, cheers.
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:07:13
Hopefully on both counts! We don't make a Prosecco, so that will mean finding the right partner. Sales &lt; 1 case is a ball that it's in our court, and we'll get it figured out!
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:08:53
Afraid not, unfortunately, at least not for the time being. Thanks, though, appreciate the sentiment.
