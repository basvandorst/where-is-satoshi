I have been a very very very satisfied customer for the past 4 months. I had forgotten my decryption password and I couldn't log into my account. You personally called me in a few minutes and helped me out! I couldn't believe it.   
Depositing is also very fast. I do it by certified cheques and it is in my account in 2 days.  
Just 2 things:  
1. I wish you had better charts  
2. Please add VTC

I have been reading about Bitcoin for more than a year, and I have some Bitcoins for more than 6 months, but I didn't know I shouldn't trust Paypal. Because I don't even have a Paypal account. Because I even can't have a Paypal account.

Yes, please. I have been looking around but didn't find any. :(

Fuck Gox. I was so close to transfer my Bitcoins to Gox last year. I just can't imagine what my life would be if I had done that transfer.I feel so sorry for all the people who have lost(!) their Bitcoins.

I think it's a great time for Satoshi (the real one) himself to use some of his coins, Nah?!

It's 2am now and yes, it was worth it.
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:38:44
Exactly, I had it open for a few minutes and more than 80% of the coins were going to China. It's been like this for weeks now.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:56:43
Done. Fuck you Mr. Karpeles.

So, in the US invasion to Iraq you supported US to kill innocent people in Iraq, just because US is a capitalist?

Unfortunately, or fortunately!, most people living in north America(the West) don't understand how devaluation of fiat money feels. They are blind to the future and can't see the inevitable.
You don't understand how it feels to see the money you had been saving to pay the rent for a year, is now only sufficient for less than 6 months. Suddenly your whole family's salary is 1/3 your school tuition fee. 
I am an Iranian and like anyone living in Iran, I suffered from the devaluation of Rial by more than 60% in the fall of 2012. I don't want this to happen to anyone living on this planet. Me and my family went through a very very hard time to support me study in a "North-American" university and paying high international tuition fees. 
If people knew how it felt, they wouldn't think twice and would exchange their savings to Bitcoins. If you are lucky enough to get paid in USD it doesn't mean you'll never experience what people in Iran/Argentina/Venezuela/... experienced. I believe It's inevitable, it will happen and you just won't believe how it happened. 
Keep up your great work Mr.Antonopoulos. Me and my family support you from the bottom of our hearts :D
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:45:39
No doubt abt it. Grwat service and support.
Just don't be lazy and do the CAD-USD excjange yourself at a local exchange office rather than banks with the high fees.

@_date: 2015-08-14 04:19:58
No offense taken. I can totally understand why some one might think like that. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:00:25
Oh man, I'm Iranian and you can't believe how happy I am. I hope it gets off of such lists ASAP.
