Good find. I'll fix that up.

Good point. I was hoping to get on the front page of HackerNews today and get a bidding war going. I'll change it back to something more reasonable. 4 hours maybe? wdyt?

All proceeds will go to wishbone.org. Wishbone is a great charity that helps send low-income kids in the SF bay area and NYC to extracurricular classes and activities.

Thanks. It's a fair point. If I do this again I'll find a way to validate that I'm associated with the cause.

Thanks! I hadn't thought of the off-chain donations. Maybe I'll throw that in the next version.
@_date: 2014-04-09 00:44:04
Yup! good point.

If it helps, I've published this under my real name, Jonathan Baudanza.

Good call on the clickable QR Codes.
I think in the next version I'll have more options for how the winner times out.
I'd like to make a derivative app that acts sort of like a playlist. Instead of submitting text, you would submit soundcloud tracks. If I did that, the timeout system would have to be drastically different. If you're interested, send me a note at jon and I'll keep you in the loop.

It will. I actually work for that charity as a web developer. Coinsayswhat is more of an experiment rather than a schema to make money.

I don't know but it seems pretty popular.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:33:20
Thanks! I have some more plans for it as well. For example, It'd be fun to embed this into an ad-unit sized IFRAME. Or maybe project it onto a wall and let people TXT in messages.

My bill 
My bitcoin transaction

Just bitcoin right now. If I accepted alternate coins, it would be difficult to rank the bids.

How is it possible that this was mining into the blockchain? I have two guesses:
1) Whoever did this has access to enough hashing power to mine their own non-standard transactions into blocks.
2) The $0.43 transaction fee is high enough to incentivize other miners to add to the blockchain, even though this is a non-standard transaction.
If it's  that's very interesting. $0.43 is much larger than most tx fees, but is still very affordable.

I am at Nara right now. The manager says I'm their first bitcoin customer. I love this place! I come here at least once a week. I'll be coming here more now
