More than circumstantial.  He is the only qualified UNNAMED person who also associates with the same small group of people already suspected of being Satoshi but deny it.  Read his CV.  Likely.

None of this disproves any of the above-mentioned:  The Satoshi Nakamoto moniker has become something much larger than one individual.  My guess is that those already pointed out or suspected are also involved, as a project of this magnitude obviously would require five to seven people in the least.
Those posting may not be the same person who conceived the very simple, very elegant architecture at its core.  It takes teams of professionals to develop something like this.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:01:30
Who is to say those posting are him?  I never assumed those posting were him.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:55:07
Har har, that's a good one!  Yes, me identifying a person, publicly, for authoring a public work = me "violating the ethical principle of giving a man his privacy!"
I love you conspiracy theorists.  Your "ideas" are so cute.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:17:01
Actually, no, there are not.  If you do your research, you'll find that Nakamoto is not even in the 100 most common surnames in Japan.  You'll find that there's only 1 whose area of research directly coincides with all Bitcoin is.  Could be coincidental, but I doubt it.  I'm not suggesting he's "the lone gunman," though.  There are likely many others, such as those already pointed out as being the principals.

Reiter worked in the private sector until 2007, at which point he joined UNC for an academic life.
The Szabo link cannot be downplayed:  Szabo linked to Reiter's old (now defunct) Bell page (the link is still up).  This implies Szabo knew of Reiter (and likely vice-versa) before 2007.
Here is a list of people Reiter has ever published with:
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:45:11
You guys are right.  That's a dead end.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:59:48
The person who wrote Bitcoin is American.
That person would have to possess a specialist's knowledge of all things Bitcoin is as a protocol before 2008, such as those borrowed elements from Wei Dai and Nick Szabo.
Now, break Bitcoin down into its basic components.  Now try to match them up with anybody with a publishing record who's American and a specialist in the field.
Read Reiter's CV and bibliography.
Whoops, yeah, they don't match.
I should totally retract my argument.
C'mon, somebody, disprove me.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:15:24
It wasn't him, obviously, or, if it was, who knows?  I am not the Judas.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:32:13
I do.  I firmly, wholeheartedly believe in the protocol as a secure, online, decentralised peer-to-peer form of currency.
I think the politicisation of the currency is dangerous, though, because the currency is ingenious in its workings as a currency.
It also gives us the ability to build whatever system of exchange we wish, to virtually create a new economy or even economies, based upon the principles we establish.
I have yet to see this done.
More and more, a fast-growing, corporate 'support' sector is growing at a much greater rate than open-end, decentralised projects are.  For-profit ventures may not intend to become the Google or Facebook -- creating a de facto cyberspace monopoly -- but they will, as long as the bitcoinomy involves for-profit, centralised agents setting the infrastructure standards.
What was (and still can be, if we choose to make it) a real grassroots movement with global reach will quickly turn into Starbucks.
The beauty of Bitcoin is not Bitcoin itself.  We know it works.  (Thanks Satoshi et al.) It's that it allows us to create whatever, new economy or economies we want.
Therein lies its greatest potential.
I'd be weary of those looking to capitalise on the development of its infrastructure, especially those tending toward centralisation.

Btw, Reddit, downvotes, upvotes, or outright dismissal to not disprove this claim.  I am turning to you for an intelligent exchange, if you're up to it.  If not, that's cool.  I understand you're shy (or too emotionally blinded to remember that freedom of information flow is a part of Bitcoin and what we're about).
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:16:11
Look closer.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:20:46
Sleazy would be besmirching his character.  He's the author of a public work.  Like it or not, he's put himself in a public position.  Same with all the posts online:  this is a public exchange.
I have never said anything negative about his person, his name or his work.  In fact, quite the opposite.
I am not ruining anybody's life.
The outcomes of Bitcoin's fame rest on those who authored and developed the protocol, not me.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:01:01
Ex co-worker?
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:01:37
Because he's bad-the-fuck-ass is how.  He's Satoshi Fuckin' Nakamoto.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:15:59
I think everybody has raised great points!
I'm not here thinking I'm right.  I want to be disproven, but I am beginning to learn that this hypothesis has some traction.
Yes, I don't know what to make of the LinkedIn profile, but I do not think it's a coincidence.
I think we must now evaluate everything Satoshi's written.  I was unaware of the manga links.  What's the story behind those?
I was reviewing his posts on bitcointalk.org.  This could be due for textual analysis.
Why do I assume he's American?  His phrases and spellings when giving advice in the bitcoin forum posts.
He has also done a lot of research on the byzantine structures.
Do I believe he knew Wei Dai's work when publishing the paper?  Yes.
Do I believe he knew of Dai's idea when he came up with Bitcoin?  No.
Bitcoin seems more heavily indebted to Szabo to me.
He probably found out about Dai's work while later fleshing out Bitcoin's architecture in his head.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:43:15
It is him, writing-wise.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:01:51

I've compared his writing in his original paper and different sources online. They match a few different online identities. Not just the ones known. Got a few host names on irc of him as well, do some more digging but keep it to yourself because truly his life is at risk. And revealing who he is will probably throw him in a depression or get him killed... Be careful
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:05:05
In another thread of mine, another user claimed to have done this.  He might be able to disprove my theory.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:20:33
ask yourself what you wouldnhave to know in order to have done what satoshi did?  youd have to know reiter knows.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:58:49
Or he legitimately was busy, and moved onto something else.  Why is that so hard to believe, too?  Sometimes face-value explanations are more predictive than fanciful conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:21:28
many believe he's located on the east coast of the u.s. as well:
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:36:16
the photo may not be him and he was based in nj but i do not think it is a coincidence satoshi's name is mentioned.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:38:57
paul krugman would have been considered foolish by adam smith.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:45:30
Well, if I'm right, it only took me 14 hours to figure it out.  Somebody else would have found it eventually as well.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:17:47
Do a hit to see how many, if any, from the original mailing list match those names found in Reiter's CV.  You may be surprised.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:36:53
The truth will out.
However, I do believe I'm on the mark with this one.
If not, disprove me, please!  I will not be offended (as many of those in this community who think my even searching or asking is somehow wrong or violative when it adheres to all basic rules of free, public information flow that Bitcoin's grounded in). I look at this dispassionately.
If I'm wrong, then someone else will figure it out.  Good on them.

@_date: 2013-04-14 04:12:03
Who is to say there are not multiple uncredited authors to the original white paper as there are in most research papers?
As per the rest of the conspiracy theories, believe what you want.
If the principal architect is indeed the person I named, then I do not take privacy concerns seriously , as I simply followed the name trail found on a publicly available document as well as publicly available information.
I still have yet to see credible evidence to the contrary.
I am merely presenting a case of the most likely.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:14:51
Cool, then, let's disprove the hypothesis!  As I've said, I don't mind being wrong.  Let's prove me wrong.  This just narrows down the list of candidates if it's not him.  But I think it is.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:56:21
Yeah knew this.  Thx tho.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:32:52
Here's why I do not take the political ideologies associated with those in and around Bitcoin seriously.  Notice the associated communities on the right side of this sub-reddit:  libertarian; anarcho-capitalism; Austrian economics.
Everything I am doing and saying is grounded in these principles, which believe in the true, free flow of information.
Considering I am only using what's publicly available (trust me, I'm tech illiterate), I am merely engaging in a free exchange.  Oh, unless, suddenly, that's bad?
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:04:15
The only person with a CV who ALSO is American and interacts with those already suspected of being Satoshi but deny it.  That's more than a passing coincidence considering how small the group of people is.  Go through and read all the CVs on the original mailing list.
This is likely him.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:15:36
I am using the idea of searching a knowledge chain.
I am using what Satoshi likely knows.
He knew everything in the original white paper at the time of writing.
His bibliography suggests many basic classics in cryptography.
There's heavy influence from Wei Dai.
When compared to Nick Szabo's collected writings (it's all online), one would surely conclude Satoshi is Szabo.
But it does not fit.
The person writing as Satoshi is concise, thoroughly knowledgeable about his programming subject and very, deeply intelligent on the architecture.  He's comfortable with the subject.
He also writes more curtly than Szabo.
But Szabo's key but it's not likely him.
I began choosing those with specialist knowledge who might somehow informationally (along a knowledge chain) be linked to Szabo.
Boom:  Reiter.
He's the only one unnamed with a connection to Szabo but also with a connection to those already named but deny it AS WELL as in mailing list.
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:26:41
Yeah, it took me 14 hours of searching.  I think it helps that so many online users obfuscate the issue.  Why reporters have not figured this out is beyond me.
