if you're on coinbase, buy $51.99 at a time instead of $50. The fee is $1.99 either way so you'll get a higher % of your money going to btc rather than going to the fee

Coinbase owns a lot of bitcoin
When you but 1 btc from them, they mark off 1 btc from their stash and say “this belongs to you” but don’t actually send it
Once you actually withdraw it from coinbase, then they send the btc from their stash to your wallet

I don't have numbers but I'd guess a significant amount of btc is held in people's accounts on coinbase (like beginners who buy btc and don't withdraw it to their own wallet) the btc they have in their account isn't actually theirs, it's a section of coinbase's reserves that is marked as theirs.

No you still pay a 1.99 fee but that's 3.82% of $51.99 versus 3.98% on a $50 buy. 
You just get slightly more btc per dollar

Would it not increase the value of btc held privately and securely if all the coins held on coinbase were hacked/lost?

So it's essentially a digital paper wallet if that makes any sense? So it's more secure than blockchain where the hosting company could possibly mess with a user's btc since it only exists on your phone?

Thanks! I think I'll be switching as I don't see any reason not to.

No, when you put in your money it'll tell you how much Bitcoin you'll receive in your wallet. The transaction fee is already included in that and calculated by the ATM.

what makes bread wallet better than other iOS wallets? I'm using blockchain (the app from blockchain.info) why should I switch?
