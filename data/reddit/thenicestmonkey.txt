Why would they want to move to something decentralized as oppposed to something they directly control?


The dollar is the world reserve currency largely because Oil is traded in it. Not the other way around.


Those costs are mostly political. The US has a vested interest in propping up regimes who wish to perpetuate the petrodollar.


*Some* want to do so because they do not find the relationship wit the United States to be sufficiently beneficial. Many (Saudi Arabia chiefly) are are happy to continue.
Bitcoin doesn't provide similar political benefits and if the cartel is no longer interested in leveraging their oil assets politically then why not trade in a currency *they* control.


No I'm saying OPEC, which already acts as a cartel, would collectively issue a coin.


All sorts of assets are already traded electronically. I mean this is just the issuance of a new currency. It could be traded just like any other on any forex exchange.

That's an interesting point. Of course diverting resources from their mining operations towards an "attack" reduces the security on *their* coin of choice too. If a new corporate backed coin could come out of the gate with hashing equivalent to litecoin (for example) I wonder if bitcoin miners would have sufficient resources to attack it.


Sure. However in the context of a corporate backed coin I think liquidity becomes a smaller issue as the corporate backer (in my hypothetical - Amex/Mastercard/Visa) could act as an initial exchange with "cardholders" buying into the coin and businesses receiving the coin selling to those buyers.

That's not a bad point. And honestly this guidance is for the Erik Voorhees' of the world...not the blakejacks (unless you're one of those secret BTC multi millionaires). If you're trying to liquidate 100s of thousands or millions of dollars in coins you're almost certainly going to leave a paper trail and they're going to go after it. If you bought a coin a year ago and use it to buy some computer parts no one is going to come after you - just like no one comes after you for not paying sales tax on your Amazon purchases (which you're supposed to do on your tax returns!)

You only pay taxes on *realized* capital gains. Spending coins (converting them to dollars, other cryptos, or products) is considered selling them and is therefore a tax event. If you buy a $100 product with BTC you will be charged 20% long term capital gains tax on top of any sales tax that might apply.
On the flip side if your bitcoins are worth less than you purchased them for spending them will reduce your capital gains liability for the year.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:07:30


Sure. But only to a point. In an extreme example if the cost of a 51% attack rises from $1 to $1,000,000 that's much more significant than the cost of such an attack rising from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000. I think there are diminishing returns to increased hashing with regards to reducing the probability of mounting a successful attack.


Maybe. Again if a coin is sufficiently secure that an attack is very unlikely is probably not much less desirable than a coin where hashing power is doubled (but an attack is only marginally less likely ) assuming the first coin has deeper adoption / penetration. From a consumer perspective I think ease of use would trump security after a certain threshold has been reached.

Remember, none of this matters until you're audited. You could simply not ever claim bitcoin income and be totally fine until the IRS audits you.

The IRS statement was not a ruling. It was a guidance - basically an FAQ answer regarding how to treat bitcoins for tax purposes. This means that bitcoins were *always* taxable - however many people were confused so the IRS issued a clarification.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:09:56
Just to be clear, my primary objection to your original statement was your description of an "owners economy vs a debtors economy". I don't think that's at all accurate because under the model you've described the "owner" isn't the person seeking financing...it's the person who *provides* financing. So owner vs debtor is a bad comparison because those are two different people. What's more accurate is "equity seller vs. debtor" which I think amounts to renter vs debtor.


Watch any commercial for a car dealer and at least 50% of it is discussing the "favorable" financing that is available ("no money down, low APR"). If financing wasn't popular then this would be poor advertising.
Also "car loan" can be short hand for any loan taken to buy a depreciating asset. Large mechanical equipment, for example, would qualify. 


Not really. A loan is a fixed payment with fixed cash flows. You know precisely how much it will cost to service a loan until it is paid off. Conversely equity is a variable cost...which (depending on your circumstances) can ultimately be very high.
Our current model leverages both debt and equity to ensure that borrowers are able to receive financing at the lowest possible rates. If you are a new enterprise with uncertain cash flows (but good future prospects) you sell equity because you can't commit to making loan payments. If you are established you take on debt because you are best able to service that debt and don't have to give up an ownership stake.


We're discussing a world where BTC has supplanted fiat. If you need a car or other depreciating asset and don't have cash on hand you *need* to receive BTC now for some form of future payment into the future - so there is not other option.


Debt isn't necessarily bad. Encouraging savings vs frivolous debt is fine. But it can be responsible to take on debt if that's the cheapest way you can get financing for some investment you want to make.


Why would that be the case? Why would they not just become big care rental agencies (hell they already lease a significant portion of their cars) because few will have the funds to actually buy one?
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:28:26
The two aren't mutually exclusive. Say Visa/Amex/Master come out with VAMCoin (or whatever) and agree to update their point of sale systems and back end infrastructures to all accept the coin. They then premine the shit out of it and release it into the wild (with some initial mining support to get the  ball rolling). Overnight you have a coin that is with more immediate utility that BTC and the only difference is that the "early adopters" were big corporations instead of random tech buffs on the internet.
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:07:58


If rates are near zero then by definition they are not rising - which was a requirement for your scenario ("rising interest rates which will impair the ability to roll-over the existing mountain of debt"). 


What leads you to think there is a limit. If there is deflation such that the strength of the dollar is killing our exports then why wouldn't the Fed continue to grow its balance sheet and increase the money supply. 
I'm not saying there is no scenario that would be difficult for the Fed to handle. I'm just saying that *your* scenario seems unlikely to cause them trouble because expansion of the money supply has the dual impact of reducing rates and increasing prices (and vice versa contraction of the money supply does the opposite).
A scenario that is difficult for them to handle is something like what we saw in the 70s where rates and inflation are both high. In such a scenario the Fed wouldn't be able to just hike rates to combat inflation nor could it print money to decrease borrowing costs.

The $600 limit is the threshold above which *individual transactions* must be reported to the IRS via a 1099 form. If you Sold 10 BTC and made $1000 on the trade you would need to fill out a 1099 for that trade *specifically* and include it in your tax filing.
In the example above if you made a second trade where you only earned $500 you wouldn't need to file a 1099, however you will still need to pay taxes on all $1500 in capital gains.
The $600 threshold has nothing to do with income. 
With regards to you being a minor miner you would still need to pay income taxes though you likely won't have to pay anything due to your income for the year being below the personal exemption.

To receive interest you must give your money to a lending institution. The rate of interest you receive is dependent on that institution being able to lend out your deposits. Money lent out will, ostensibly, be spent. Therefore even if the interest rates beat inflation you are still creating more consumption because you are incentivizing lending which leads to spending.

It's definitely plausible. I just don't think it's common enough to torpedo the entire idea of being *able* to treat BTC as property.


To be fair most people can't file their taxes correctly with or without BTC. That's why we have software like Turbo Tax and services like H&amp;R block. Computing your BTC cost basis will be dead simple for the vast majority of people while more complicated individuals may have to leverage the services of a professional. I mean people *could* guess but they'll be in bad shape if they get audited - same with fiat capital gains.

Why do you feel its in tangibleness is relevant? I mean we allow shares in a corporation (intangible slices of an intangible legal entity to be treated as property.

Corporeality really doesn't have much impact on whether something is or isn't property.

There's not much of a discussion to have though. The difficulty rate is a function of network hashing power. We know exactly why this is happening.

Consider a depreciating asset like a car. Our current model charges higher rates of interest for this type of loan vs something like a mortgage because the collateral rapidly depreciates in value.
Under your financing scheme how would the "lender" take equity? Would it be in the car? Because that's a depreciating asset that pays no dividend.

Well there are two networks we can talk about. The physical hashing network and the "usage" network (of businesses that already accept bitcoin etc). The latter (usage) is basically insignificant. If Visa, Amex, and MasterCard turn around and say "our systems all back CreditCoin" then that new alt will have a much larger usage network than BTC basically overnight.
With regards to mining and confirmations, it looks like the Bitcoin network operates at a rate of [125 million gigahashes per second]( Just as a rough estimate, the Antminer S2 produces ~1000 GH/s for ~$2000 for about $2 per GH/s. So using only commercial pricing it looks like you could replicate the Bitcoin network for about $250 million.
Considering that individual banks have paid fines that are an order of magnitude larger than that I don't think a conglomeration of banks and financial services companies would find it impossibly difficult to create such a network. This is also assuming they don't distribute the hashing in the same way Bitcoin has. If they just commit to maintaining at least 51% of the network (for control purposes) then their actual costs come down significantly.


One thing I didn't mention is that much of the VC money is going towards Bitcoin enterprises that seek to replicate existing financial services for Crypto. If existing banks/payment providers operate their own crypto thes players aren't as necessary (though I imagine they'll simply be acquired for their tech).
Essentially my main point is that these predictions hinge on the idea that eventually Wall Street is just going to throw money at the early adopters when it seems entirely plausible that they take the tech and just cut the early adopters out completely.

The value of OilCoin will be entirely dependent on the demand for *Oil*. I mean think about it. This is just an Oil backed currency with OPEC as the central bank. 


OPEC is *already* a cartel which sets production quotas for member nations to control the supply (and therefore the price) of Oil globally. 


There are already speculators for Oil. These people will likely move to speculating on OilCoins as a proxy for oil.


The infrastructure of BitCoin is, from the perspective of a cartel of rich nations, not that expensive.


What benefits do they get? No central bank is the only one I can think of. Of course with OilCoin *they* become the central bank so this actually benefits them.

It has taken 4 years for Bitcoin to achieve it's current infrastructure in a decentralized and abstract way. A concerted effort by very rich nations would *obviously* achieve this faster. Particularly because bitcoin has already paved the way be developing dedicated hardware etc.
Also, I feel like you are limiting yourself to thinking of this alternative as being just like Bitcoin. Why wouldn't OPEC simply issue their own Oil backed "fiat" currency - which would be much more similar to a traditional currency than a crypto? This dramatically reduces the infrastructure overhead.
If we assume that OPEC is committed to getting off the petrodollar, what benefit do they get from Bitcoin that they don't get from issuing their own Oil Backed currency?


*Why*? Consider why most large businesses that accept Bitcoin do so through a service like bitpay - which immeidately converts to fiat. It's because those business don't *need* bitcoins. Their suppliers don't take bitcoin and those suppliers don't take bitcoin because *their* suppliers don't take bitcoin. 
However if *OIL* is trading in a specific currency, purchasers of oil will want to receive that currency and will price goods in that currency. This effect flows downstream. I mean the dollar is the world reserve currency largely because everyone needs it to buy oil.

Because in the current (inflationary) system money held as a value store is lent out for use in the broader economy. In storing your money you are enabling others to use it on credit. Now obviously if your store your money in your mattress you are also not helping the economy - but in doing so you are taking a penalty by losing value to inflation.
With a deflationary currency borrowing becomes more expensive because no only do you need to pay a premium to justify the risk lending an appreciating asset - you *also* have to pay your loans back with currency that is worth more tomorrow than it is today. Deflation also eliminates the penalty for storing without lending (no value erosion) so saving has reduced benefits for the broader economy in general.

Why would they not band together to create an altcoin (premined obv) and then wire up their services to use that exclusively?

What they're saying actually goes beyond that.

That makes sense. Going back to the 51% attack - what do you think the threshold is to prevent such an attack from being feasible? With regards to a coin put out by a consortium of corporations the backers could easily raise the bar for a 51% attack to 10s, or 100s of millions of dollars. A generic alt coin being mined by individuals is definitely more susceptible to such an attack because it doesn't have institutional support behind it.

If they can tie a wallet to you they know a great deal about your finances.

In an audit scenario I imagine they'll be looking for proof that you you're making legitimate payments.
Remember an audit isn't a criminal investigation. In a simple audit (not an evasion of fraud case) the burden of proof actually rests on the person *being audited*.

Mining is income and the coins are valued on the date mined. So if you mine 1 coin when the price is 600 you owe income taxes on $600. Now say the price rises to 700 and you buy something with your coin. You now must pay additional taxes on 100 dollars of realized capital gains. Of course if the price had dropped to 500, spending the coins would create a $100 capital gains loss which could be used to offset other capital gains (but not income).

You fundamentally do not understand fractional reserve banking.


This is not correct. When you deposit money you are effectively making a callable loan to the bank. When banks lend they are not "creating new money" they are lending *your* money (which you, in turn, have lent them).


The deposited money exists once - it's the money that has been lent out or is held as bank reserves. The "money" in your checking account are just numbers on an internal ledger. Yes you can demand money at any time (deducting from your entry in the ledger). However when you are paid out you are being paid from the banks reserves. 


Here's how it would work.  When you deposit coins in BitBank they are longer in your wallet. Instead they are placed into BitBanks Wallet/Cold Storage. You now have a BitBank Account which states your holdings and allows you to request money be transferred to your personal wallet. 
BitBank can then make loans to other people by transferring money from their wallet (which has *your coins*) to other people's personal wallets. For this service they will charge demand interest and pass some of that onto you - the holders of BitBank Accounts.

Is not a compelling use case for the vast majority of people. It is non trivial to secure your Bitcoins which means you're putting in more work for intangible/ideological benefits which aren't that important to many people.


Is the major barrier to ecomerce in the third world payment processing or internet access / distribution? Because it seems like the latter is the bigger hurdle. Things like M-Pesa already exist within the fiat network.


These are speculation by another name. Consistent downward price pressure from miners (what started this convo) significantly hurts these as attractive use cases.


This is the best use case on the list in that it provides a good way for people to get around artificial exchange rates. This is a very situational benefit however.


True, however the vast majority of commerce is done locally and Bitcoin doesn't provide an advantage. It's useful in the remittance market which is big but also only useful to a relatively smaller subset of people.


This is not clear.


It's definitely getting exposure however it remains to be seen if that exposure actually translates into increased interest. As it stands the transaction volume simply isn't growing indicating that new people are likely not getting involved in significant numbers.

Consider a world where OPEC demands payment in OilCoin (which they issue) and no one uses for anything else? Where will people get OilCoins? From OPEC - via trade for goods/services/or other currencies.
I mean OPEC isn't just going to give these out for free. The coins will be distributed through trade and will make their way into the market that way. Speculators may buy coins *without* intention of trading for oil as a way to profit on changes in the price of the underlying commodity.


We are probably not talking about a CryptoCurrency in the general sense. OilCoin would likely bear more resemblance to a traditional currency than a distirbuted "Crypto". However it OPEC were to drop the petro dollar it seems they would seek to replace it with a reserve currency *they* control as opposed to something distributed which they decided do *not* control. 


Decentralization was not necessary to 'secure the network'. It was necessary to ensure that no one entity controlled the protocol. In our thought experiment it would appear that OPEC would *want* to control the protocol they use rather than give power over to a decentralized network. What does decentralization really buy them?


Bitcoin transactions are painfully slow because of decentralization. Visa with 2 data centers is able to process 25,000 txs per second. Bitcoin maxes out at 7. 


A centralized, or largely centralized, network would be significantly cheaper to operate than Bitcoin. Also we're pretending like OPEC has the same considerations as any other business - which is obviously not the case. They *own* the banks that process their transactions.

Who are the people that want off the ride and who determines if they/we get off that ride? A move to Bitcoin could be beneficial to lots of people however that decision about what to price Oil in doesn't lie with them. It lies with the Oil producers. The reason the petrodollar exists and continues to exist is because those nations see benefit in perpetuating it (gaining political influence over the most power nation). If they no longer want that political influence why would switch to something that provides them no benefit or leverage.
Oil is basically a monopsony (one producer many buyers) the cartel largely gets to decide who oil is traded on it's own terms.


It wouldn't just be Saudi. It would be all of OPEC and mandating oil trade with them be done in OilCoin automatically creates demand for the currency.


Why? If I'm a refinery I need to buy Oil and will therefore need to deal with OPEC as they are the largest producers of Oil - meaning I'll need OilCoins. The easiest way to *get* OilCoins is to price your product in OilCoins.

Centralized services like Coinbase mean it's very easy for a new coin to be adopted. All Coinbase has to do is offer support and *every one of their clients* will also have support.
From a network perspective you could rebuild all the hashing power of the Bitcoin network for ~$200 million. This is a lot - but not an insurmountable number.
Visa/Mastercard/Amex/Banks could easily issue a coin and have more institutional and retail support than Bitcoin in a matter of months.

It's a syndicate of smaller buyers looking to buy *pieces* of the auction block. Each individual member of the syndicate is *not* incentivized to bid at a premium because they can fill their order on exchange without moving the price significantly. As a result the aggregate bid price will be low.
These guys were essentially trying to buy coins at discount if bidding interest was low. This doesn't seem to be the case. It is not necessarily an indication of moon prices but points to the fact the market clearing price was *not* exceptionally low.

* A guy has $10. 
* He lends you $1 and wants $1.50 back. 
This isn't some mathematically impossible scenario because the money needed to pay the guy *exists with the guy*. If you provide labor for him worth $.50 he pays you $.50 which you then use to pay back the $1.50. 
At the end you received a loan for a $1. You sold labor for $.50. You paid back your loan for $1.50.
And yes, if everyone defaulted the whole system breaks apart. This is why the guy doesn't demand you work for 10 years to earn that $.50. He understands that if he makes the terms to stringent you will simply not pay and he'll be out $1 and any additional benefit he could have received.

If you mean "Blockchain" then sure. I'm not sure why *Bitcoins* will be a necessary part of this. For example "colored coins" can be used to represent lots of things. There is no reason (beyond leveraging the existing network) that this needs to be tied to Bitcoin specifically. 


Why - and how are you defining decentralization. The network is dominated by big players. That trend does not seem to be reversing as mining hardware becomes less accessible to the general population. Why should a consumer care that the network is controlled by Amex instead of GHash?


Miners will not mine for free. There will always bee fees of some variety in the BTC network. Additionally, so long as Bitcoin is not the *dominant* currency, those that use BTC will be subject to fees by their financial intermediaries (coin base). Finally, once you've replicated financial services like credit, banking, etc in the BTC space each of *those* services will have fees. 
Bitcoin doesn't eliminate the need for all financial services. It's value add, for the average consumer, will be having digital transfer be an intrinsic part of the currency rather than a service layered on by someone else. All the other services we use will still be provided in some way.


Again the *blockchain* and network can be used for this, I'm not sure that this needs to be tied to Bitcoins specifically. CreditCoin could easily exist alongside other assets using the same network for hashing.

Not even close. To get a distribution that bad you have to make a bunch of stupid assumptions:
1. The only money that counts is M0 - i.e.: actual bills in circulation.
2. The wealth of the 400 richest people in the world is held entirely in cash and specifically held in us dollars. No other currency.
Under those two assumptions you get a distribution as bad (actually worse) than Bitcoin.
Of course both assumptions are totally ridiculous. Wealth is obviously not limited cash (and definitely not limited to USD only) and the money supply doesn't just include M0.

Yes and no. Banks always keep 90% of their deposits as reserves. However money that is lent is spent and redeposited and then lent again. This expands the money supply to multiple of the monetary base.


When the loan is repaid the bank is obviously incentivized to go make another loan. They do not make money by holding excess reserves. 
With that in mind the total money supply is controlled by a few things: Monetary Base, Reserve Requirements, and demand for credit.

The calls for "proof of stake" have arisen as a result of institutions lying about holding deposits in full.

Right, but that's full employment through the exercise of sound monetary policy - which is the unfortunate hurdle in bailing out the public.
Consider what happens when the Fed buys a bunch of toxic assets or Treasury bonds. The Fed issues "new money" and purchases assets which it holds on its balance sheet. It usually does this to drive down interest rates which encourages borrowing and economic expansion. However expanding the money supply is an inflationary measure. Should the economy pick up and inflation begin to rise the Fed can (and does) sell assets off its balance sheet to remove liquidity from the system.
When bailing out homeowners what asset does the Fed collect? The Fed can't just buy up all the mortgages and write them off. If they do so they have greatly increased the money supply, propped up a housing bubble, and have given themselves no way to undo the effect. 
Housing relief *has* to come from the Federal Government because there is not sound policy the Fed could enact to aid homeowners without handcuffing themselves.

You're simply describing the difference between accrual accounting and cash accounting. In accrual accounting revenue is recorded when services are rendered and expenses are recorded when they are incurred. In cash accounting revenue and expenses are recorded at the time of payment.
You are basically free to choose which ever method you want - however you must be consistent. If you want to change your methods for a given accounting period you have to file a form with the IRS.
In the hypothetical you have provided you are suggesting it is *impossible* to accurately use accrual method accounting because you cannot determine the time when services were rendered and the market is volatile such that your income is unclear.

This assumes that the coin is functionally equivalent to Bitcoin in every way. OPEC could obviously create a Bitcoin-*like* currency that for the purposes of getting off the petrodollar. I mean this is one of the most important markets in the world - the resources exist to craft something specific as opposed to taking an "off the shelf" item.
I mean even if they went with a pure BTC clone the actual set up of the coin wouldn't be *that* complicated or expensive. I mean consider the network/hashrate. We're at something like 125,000 TH/s? An antminer S2 is like $2k and puts out 1 TH/s. So for $250,000,000 you could recreate the hashing power of the network with *consumer* grade technology (this is just back of the envelope please let me know if my assumptions are wrong). OPEC probably has $250mm in their couch cushions.
With regards to setting up the network it looks like GHash,io directly controls like 12% of the network (this is excluding the CEX.io cloud hashing) and they probably have a dozen employees *at most*. 
Finally if you're talking adoption - we're talking about tying the price of *Oil* to this altcoin. That's necessarily going to drive adoption. Are you a business that needs/wants Oil? Well you better find a way to get your hands on some OilCoins.


Let's say OPEC drops a billion dollars on Asics and therefore has a network with something like 4 times the hashing power of Bitcoin. Sure it's super concentrated but if you want to buy Oil from any OPEC nation you deal with.


This isn't DOGE coin. We're basically talking about the creation of an Oil backed currency issued by a cartel that controls a significant portion of global oil production. A pre-mine means that there won't be early adopters trying to strike it rich. However you basically have a captive market of people who *have* to deal with you because you control a resource that they want.


People need oil more than they care about their ideology.


What network effect? Compared to the market for Oil bitcoin is basically insignificant. By pricing oil in OilCoin and mandating that it is the medium of trade OPEC over night creates a network effect many times stronger than what Bitcoin has.


You're absolutely making certain people rich by using it. The vast majority of extant Bitcoins are owned by very few people. This is my reason for believing that BTC will not be adopted in this way. Why will the already rich, with all their power and resources, trade away wealth and control to a bunch of nobodies who happen to own some numbers on the internet.


It's certainly duplicative but it definitely wouldn't be unnecessary to the people doing it. You're recreating a system except instead of "early adopters' holding most of the wealth *you* continue to hold most of the wealth.
And with regards to adoption I'll just keep repeating the fact that forcing the global market for Oil onto this coin is a very powerful incentive for adoption.


Sure. I'm not saying OilCoin would be a good thing for us. I'm saying it would be a good thing for OPEC which is why I don't think OPEC would switch to Bitcoin.

I really don't get what the major revelation in that paper is. Here is Graeber's summary of the issue.


Except there is a mathematical limit on how much money the banking system can create via this system.
Say there are 100 base dollars in the system and a 10% reserve requirement.
Bank 1 lends out 90 dollars which are deposited in Bank 2.
Bank 2 lends out 81 dollars which are deposited in Bank 3
Bank 3 lends out 72.9 dollars which are deposited in Bank 4
This goes on *infinitely* but that doesn't mean there is infinite money. The function is asymptotic and converges to $100/.1 (or base money over reserve requirement). Essentially, in the example above, the money supply will never exceed $1000.

@_date: 2014-04-03 16:37:51


That's true. Someone else posted a great post that walked through what the paper was saying. So it sounds like the reserve requirements are a soft (not hard) break on the money supply as the central bank will often act to fill in any missing reserves with loans. The loans have a tendency to push up interest rates, reducing demand (commercially) for credit which eventually stops the expansion of the money supply.
I do not believe that really jives with Graeber's central assertion that money is infinite and things like austerity are pointless. If the demand for credit as *so* great that banks lent at very high levels the central bank *would* step in to curb the growth in the money supply. They'd probably do this through raising reserve requirements which would force commercial banks to borrow more from the central bank to top up reserves which would ultimately raise interest rates (and curb borrowing).

Consider something like "apple pay" where an alternative payment network was delivered basically overnight to millions of people. I agree that a grassroots crypto faces a serious uphill battle to unseat bitcoin. Those people predisposed to being interested in crypto are already invested in BTC and therefore do not have a vested interest in switching. 
That said there are many (moneyed) groups that are not invested in Bitcoin and may not see the existing cryptos as best serving their needs. For example I think it's fairly likely that the existing banking and payments sector will eventually come out with their own form of decentralizing payments to allow more seamless peer to peer electronic transactions.

If the market is primed for a non governmental crypto currency I think there is a very high probability that a technology - sponsored by major players in the existing financial system - will emerge.
If you assume otherwise you're essentially saying "I think Wall Street is going to get on board with a technology that is going to make all these *other* people rich simply because they are part of a system that they can replicate themselves".
The "corporate coin" may very well come in the form of a major bank (or more likely syndicate of banks) buying up a competing Bitcoin Technology (Etherium or whatever comes out next) and promoting the hell out of that (while holding a large amount of the existing coins). For a non-crypto using consumer there is little to no difference between buying into Bitcoin (which makes random techies rich) or buying into the Corporate Coin (which makes random stock holders rich). The only difference will be that the infrastructure for the corporate coin will be pre-built and much more available.
If Crypto Currency is actually something that will catch on and really change the way we do commerce it is *inevitable* that the existing players will try to promote something. I personally feel that if they time their entry correctly they could severely undercut Bitcoin adoption by presenting something that simply works better with more support and protections.

Sort off. Let's breakdown what you are saying point by point.


Exactly. It's very important to remember that when people talk about the money supply the usually don't mean physical bills and coins. It's all just paper money and the coins/bills are physical tokens that represent that paper money. 
Even when the Fed "prints money" they do so by conjuring up numbers in a computer and using those conjured numbers to buy Treasuries. The seller of the Treasury is paid in the conjured money...which is no officially in the system.
There are no bills or coins representing that conjured money - however it is considered part of the monetary base.


Temporarily yes. You pay back the bank and the money is now in it's reserves. Obviously the bank will try to lend again but for a short time the money supply contracts. It's worth noting that banks often *over* lend and need to borrow money from each other to ensure they have enough reserves.

@_date: 2014-03-24 06:15:03
This is not correct. *Legal Tender* (which is what I think you mean when you say fiat) simply means that the *physical currency* (notes and coins) are a valid means of settling a USD denominated debt, public charges, taxes, and dues. What that means is that if you owe someone 100 dollars and you give them 10,000 pennies (to be a jerk) the debt is considered settled in the eyes of the law.
That does not mean that all debts can be settled in USD. So your hypothetical (that Goldman forces its creditors to accept USD after manipulating the price of BTC) can't happen. 
In fact, legal tender statutes don't even require businesses to accept all forms of USD. A store, for example, can refuse to tender hundreds or pennies. So long as the payment in question isn't a debt they can simply refuse to engage in the transaction with you if you don't have the right form of currency (or if they want to barter the appropriate good to trade).

Why do you feel that's the case? I think Bitcoin's viability will be determined and at which point a corporate coin enters the market. I don't think the existing financial industry will wait for full Bitcoin saturation before making their move.


That seems like a premature statement. Bitcoin certainly has a headstart but it's "network" effect is definitely not insurmountable. That may be true for a random altcoin (doge, lite, etc) but I think the advantage BTC has quickly falls away when faced with massive existing infrastructure and resources.


Why do you say that? How many Core Bitcoin Developers are there? How many employees of major mining pools? What are these 1000s of tech guys  needed for? It's certainly not an easy task but if you summed up all the core developers, major mining pool operators, and major exchange employees I don't think you get close to 1000 people.

I don't understand why that would be the case. If OPEC demanded that all Oil bought from them be purchased in OilCoin would not the market cap of OilCoin simply be reflective of the price/demand for Oil? There don't need to be "IPO" speculators because you're tying the price of your currency to existing trade in a hard asset.


Too low for what? Bitcoins market cap largely reflects the expectations of speculators (because the price is not justified by actual usage). OilCoin would a little different because actual usage would dominate the price (though obviously expectations on the price of Oil would play into it).


This assumes OilCoin is decentralized which, if it's being issued and controleld by OPEC, it doesn't have to be. OilCoin would essentially be a hybrid between a commodity backed currency (like old school dollars) and a crypto-currency (electronic banking/trading etc). 
Also even if the network *was* distributed it woudl not be that expensive (from a the perspective of a rich country) to achieve hashing power equal to the Bitcoin network. Elsewhere in this thread I estimated the cost of replicating the bitcoin networks hardware at ~250 million dollars using consumer hardware prices. It would likely be less than this should a country want to do this.


AuroraCoin was issued by random people with no backing. It was no different than any alt. This hypothetical OilCoin we're discussing would be very different because it would have significant institutional backing and be tied to an extremely important commodity.


No I'm suggesting that the OPEC nations would "pre mine" *all* the currency in the same way the Fed premines all the dollars. They then mandate that all trade with them (for Oil) be done in OilCoins. 


In creating their own currency they can include the features that allow Bitcoin to have low fees and quick transactions. This is obviously not unique to Bitcoin.

Why do you think this makes a difference with regards to *income*. Either the IRS can tie an account to you (or, rather, claim that an account belongs to you and you are unable to demonstrate that it doesn't) - in which case every coin entering that account from a source that cannot be shown to be another wallet you own is income. Or they can't tie a wallet to you in which case they don't know about it and mixing is irrelevant.

Hedge Funds are investment vehicles where outside investors pool their money together an have a money manager (or usually a team of money managers) invest their wealth for them. The management group makes money by taking 2% of assets under management as a fixed fee and claiming 20% of profits (over the funds high water mark) as a performance bonus.
In this case of this fund the management group will likely tax 2% of assets cut across all the investments they are making (so bitcoin *and* stock in bitcoin companies). That way the proportion of their holdings doesn't change.

I don't think a mixer would actually help. The IRS would simply see coins leave your wallet and different coins (of equal value less fees) come back in.

In the worst case they would treat the initial tx (coins out) as a "sale" and you would owe tax on any gains "realized".

If you are some random guy who tells me they are making a big trade - and I trade ahead of you - that's not "frontrunning" in a criminal sense.  I owe you nothing and you sharing your trading strategy with me is y our own fault.
However if I'm your broker and I see a client making a big order and trade ahead of you then I'm criminally frontrunning. I have a fiduciary duty towards client and if I use information they give me to enrich myself (at their expense) then I am breaking the law.
In this specific case the trader was manipulating the market "artificially" deflating the price of securities.

From the IRS:

Therefore, taxpayers will be required to determine the fair market value of virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment or receipt. If a virtual currency is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.

The government doesn't *have* to borrow its money from the Fed. It has to borrow its money from *somewhere*. In the absence of the Fed the demand for government bonds would be lower and the interest payments higher therefore raising the total cost of borrowing across the board. The Fed, with its *congressional* mandate to both promote full employment and control inflation/deflation, acts as a lender to the government by issuing "new money" to keep rates low. This adds liquidity to the system and drives rates down to allow business to borrow and expand.

That's not correct. A fractional reserve bank lends a *fraction* of the money that has been deposited while keeping the remainder in reserve. The amount that is allowed to be lent depends on a reserve requirement usually set by a central banking authority. If the reserve requirement is 10% the bank can only lend out 90% of it's deposits. The reason this leads to a money multiplier effect is because the money that has been lent out is, eventually, deposited bank in the banking system and then lent out again. 
For example if 100 dollars is deposited the bank can only lend out 90. However those 90 are eventually deposited in another bank which then lends out 81. This goes on indefinitely with an upper bound of ~1000 dollars in the system (assuming a 10% reserve requirement).
One caveat to this is the fact that when there is a central bank/lender of last resort, banks can lend below the reserve requirement and make up the difference via short term loans from the central bank. This means that the money supply is dependent on the policies of the central bank (how willing they are to make those short term loans) and the demand for credit. As as a result you see some countries, like Australia, have 0 reserve requirements allowing banks to lend *all* the money they have on deposit (but never more) and make up and short term shortfalls by loans from the central bank.
With bitcoin there is no central bank so the fractional reserve banking system for BTC would be entirely based on the limits of the money multiplier effect and whatever self imposed reserve requirements are in place.

The issue you are pointing out is if there when the cash is deposited so there is the deposit, the debt, and another deposit - which allows the bank to make additional loans. In this scenario paying off the debt is no different from withdrawing your cash from the bank and paying someone else. Every dollar you withdraw from your savings account represents loans that the bank will not be able to make.

That's what I said. Money is a medium of transfer. In your scenario someone used real assets (or labor) to acquire wealth and gave you $10 million. That $10 million is slowly being eroded by inflation so you buy more real assets to protect and increase you wealth.
Money, in this scenario, didn't make the person who gave you the money rich nor does it make you richer. In fact the money on it's own is making your poorer over time. Money simply allows value to be transferred to you so you can transfer it to someone else in exchange for actual things.

Here's where I think your analysis is off. All this stuff about being a test dummy and vetting the tech is true. However in the absence of consumer adoption proving that the tech works does not mean that Bitcoin *specifically* will increase in value. In the absence of significant user adoption simply vetting the tech opens the door for some establishment actor, a state or traditional banking consortium, to release their *own* coin using their increased visibility and clout to drive adoption. 
Bitcoin is nowhere *near* the inflection point where it becomes impossible for something new to topple it. Until that's true increasing user adoption is incredibly important.

Seeing as GDP doesn't measure wealth and instead measures economic activity can you describe how military spending does not fit into the metric? In taxing and spending the economy has created X number of tanks that did no exist previously. This is obviously a measure of economic activity. 


1, obviously, because there is simply no reason for a metric that represents just the activity of a nation to minimize or exclude the activity of the government. In a fully communist nation with 100% state sponsored industries *all* economic activity is government spending.

That depends. Your mining hardware is an asset. The "loss" you've realized this year is just the depreciation of your hardware (not the money you sunk into it).
Your annual depreciation can most simply be defined as cost/expected life. If you spent 1000 dollars on mining hardware and expect it to be usable for 2 years you have a business "expense" of $500 for the year. If you've mined more than $500 of coin you have a profit for the year. If you've mined less than $500 of coin you have a loss for the year.
You'll want to use straight line depreciation over accelerated depreciation because the hash rate is going up next year so your mining rig will be less profitable. Accelerated depreciation would allow you to realize a bigger expense this year this year and less expense in the future. However because your profits are going to be highest *this year* you want the expense to occur this year as well.

BTC isn't backed by fiat. When the dollar was truly backed by Gold there was a central authority who would directly trade dollars for BTC at a *fixed* rate. No such central authority exists for BTC. The amount of fiat you get fluctuates by supply and demand. If that's considered being "backed" by something then the USD is still backed by gold because I can go into the market and acquire a variable amount of gold for a dollar.


Currency can absolutely be defined *specifically because we invented it*. In any case when these sort of "deals" go down (someone sells something of value for BTC) the community tends to jump up and down and get overly excited. What's happening here isn't a big step forward for BTC because all parties involved are still overly concerned with the conversion to fiat - indicating that BTC still has a long way to go before anyone will be OK with pricing in BTC alone.

This is asinine. Bitcoin is a currency - it is a means of transfer and a store of wealth. Going to the store and exchanging Bitcoins for goods simply means 
"I have done work or provided goods in the past and received this recognized store of value for my labors. I will exchange this for goods from you there by allowing me to indirectly convert my work/goods into new work/goods without having to actually barter with people."


This is also asinine. 
If the store owner receives fiat he will only only be able to pay for supplies in fiat (and if he had bitcoins by this logic he would never trade them away because that means they aren't valuable). So his suppliers get fiat and *their* suppliers get fiat and all along the way the *employees* of the companies are paid in fiat. And if the employees are paid in fiat they are going to go and spend fiat for goods perpetuating the cycle. So if the entire fucking economy is operating on fiat what's the goddam point of Bitcoins?
The *best* people to demand Bitcoin adoption are the consumers. Employees *need to live* if the employer says "I'm paying you in filthy fiat" the vast majority of paid labor is going to say "okay". And obviously if the company receives fiat from it's customers it is mostly likely going to pass that on to it's consumers because converting to bitcoin is an added expense.


This is *also* stupid. "Here's $100 for a $2 candy bar - bitcoins plz". If that's your plan then why not buy $98 in bitcoin and trade $2 for candy bars. You're basically asking for every store to become an exchange which is moronic. Convenience stores are in the business of selling candy bars not speculating on forex.

It's sort of irrelevant because the situation you've described actively cannot happen.
However my understanding was that you were worried that GS could manipulate the market of BTC so they they could reap abnormal profits from a short trade. 
What you're worried about is Goldman Sachs essentially "naked shorting" BTC to keep fix an exchange rate. I would counter that such a scheme would *only* be possible in a fiat currency and performed by a central bank. Continuously shorting BTC to keep the exchange rate below some threshold would become so ludicrously expensive that the bank would have to give up eventually. However if they could print securities then keeping a currency artificially cheap is very easy.
This sort of monetary market manipulation is rarely a good idea and often results in the manipulating party losing a great deal of money.

I think you are getting mixed up. The 6% dividend is paid out to the member banks of the Federal reserve system *on the capital they are forced to invest*. This is distinct from the Fed printing money and making available to banks.
When the Fed prints money (quantitative easing), the inject it into the economy by buying Treasuries from third parties. With that in mind the Fed doesn't earn 6% on money they inject. The earn whatever the yield on Treasuries (at the time of the purchase) was.
Everything else you've described is correct though. There is a money multiplier effect that - in theory - should result in the total money supply being x/r where x is the monetary base and r is the reserve requirement. We say in theory because the Fed makes it easy for banks to borrow money from them to always meet the reserve requirement meaning the total money supply is more controlled by the demand for credit than the reserve requirement.
In any case how would you change banking to prevent this. In any system where a bank can lend money this is the net result. Would you rather banks not lend...how would you enforce that?

Honestly, the average consumer does not care about decentralization. The nuts and bolts of how the money works simply do not interest them. If the payment method is cheaper, facilitates easier online and international commerce, and is easy to use - then it will be adopted. The ideological tenants of bitcoin *will not* be a selling point during mass adoption.


Sure there is. I can buy things easily, I pay less forex fees, my purchases are largely anonymized. Beyond that what does the average person care about?


If Visa/MasterCard/Amex create a coin and say "you can use your CC to buy coin and the coin is accepted at all locations that accept our credit cards" you don't think that such a technology will *instantly* be more popular than bit coin (assuming the population is ready for a crypto in the first place).

And it *is* ridiculous, but (as you said) no more ridiculous than some son of a son of son of a rich guy being fabulously wealthy.

Thanks especially for the link to that post. People tend to throw around the Graeber piece from the Guardian discussing that paper...however that column doesn't say anything.

I think looking through the lens of what already exists is a good way to start, however I don't see the existing framework as the *only* way a crypto could ever work. Specifically if you move away from a fully decentralized system you can circumvent some of these major issues without, necessarily, losing *everything* that makes an electronic currency attractive to a consumer (you would naturally lose nearly everything that makes the currency attractive from an ideological perspective). 


The vast majority of people do like or dislike any aspect of Bitcoin. They simply do not think about it. However there are objective benefits to Bitcoin from a consumer perspective and I'm not yet convinced that those aspects could not, and *would* not, be brought to consumers through the existing financial system.
Just to clarify I'm not saying this will/should happen. I'm just not convinced that the the aspects of bitcoin that are attractive to the average person could not be replicated in a more limited product that would have significant institutional support behind it. And that such a product could severely undercut Bitcoin adoption.

That's not actually right. A bank can only lend out a fraction of it's deposits. However money lent gets spend and redeposited in banks...where it is lent out again.
Start with $100 in the bank and a 10% reserve requirement
Lend $90
Spend &amp; Deposit $90 in another bank
Lend $81
repeat infinitely
This is how the total amount of "money" (deposits) ends up being 10x the monetary base.

Not really. Yes there is a multiplier effect - but not in the way you are describing. 
Assume a world where the central bank enforces a 10% reserve requirement.
* Bank receives a deposit from A for $100
* Bank lends $90 to B
* B spends the loan at C's store
* Bank receives a deposit from C for $90
* Bank lends $81 to D
If you do this enough times you'll see the sum of all bank accounts approach $1000. However in no given transaction does the bank lend more money than exists. The multiplier effect purely exists because we treat our bank accounts (callable debt owed to us by the bank) as cash.

It's a device that prints money. You would only sell it if you need the cash right now to make an even better investment. Otherwise the economics don't line up for producer and consumer. The producer won't sell the device for less than the expected present value of its earnings (because they'd be better off just mining for themselves). A consumer won't pay more than the expected present value of its earnings because then the device will never ROI. Even if the consumer is paying fiat for the device this makes sense because the consumer *also* has the option of just buying Bitcoins.
I mean there is a reason pretty much every ASIC manufacturer stops selling to consumers and starts mining for themselves. You sell Wave 1 and 2 devices to finance the production of many Wave 3 devices. You then run those devices for yourself.

The article also fails to mention the "Fiat" part of Fiat Money.

As a result it is simply easier to receive, transact, and be taxed on the same medium rather than convert back and forth.

I don't think that would work. The simple presence of Satoshi's coins has no appreciable effect on the price of BTC because those coins are not, and have never, participated in the market. From the markets perspective those coins might as well not exist.
With Quantitative Easing the Fed was providing liquidity (money) to banks and that money as actually *spent*. The money entered the market and pushed asset prices higher. This created a feedback lloop (wealth effect) wherein prices are going up so people buy in.
Destroying Satoshi coins will not create the opposite effect because you're not actually decreasing the volume of coins on exchanges or in the market.

This guy's conclusions really don't make any sense.


Except inflation disincentivizes you from burying your money in the ground and wasting it's assets and encourages you to purchase capital assets as they provide a return. Also the stock market has outperformed real estate in aggregate so I don't know what he's talking about. 


Which goes back to the first point as borrowers are often creating economic activity through capital investment. This isn't about your neighbor putting money on his credit card for a new TV. It's about a company issuing bonds to expand their business.


This, specifically, seems to be a jab at Quantitative Easing which has caused asset prices to rise. Of course there hasn't been extra-normal inflation over that time so there's that. As a counter to those who will cite food and fuel being left out of the CPI - do you think its at all reflective on the state of the currency that fuel prices have cratered in the last 6 months? Those commodities are left out for a good reason.


That stock would need to yield &lt;3% annually to match the CPI. If your investments aren't getting you 3% you're doing something wrong.

No. The long term rate of inflation is ~2.5%. You will not find a savings account that provides that amount of interest to you. Therefore the real rate of return on a savings account is negative.


No. The bank is subject to similar conditions as the individual. The interest rate of loans is largely driven by the supply and demand of credit. A bank will make loans below the rate of inflation if they must because making some interest is better than making no interest.
Obviously the rate of inflation is can drive the demand/supply of credit but commercial banks cannot just dictate an interest rate.


It does not follow that one *must* take on debt to invest just because of inflation. The need for financing will always exist, even in a deflationary currency.

All national currencies go down in value over the years. If this has not been enough incentive for someone to buy Bitcoin the fact that the Greek's transact with it will not *necessarily* be much more of an incentive. Certainly a subset of people will see the added legitimacy as a buy signal but it doesn't follow that BTC definitely explodes in value.


Which is only necessary if you wish to avoid a central authority. As I mentioned before a national "e-currency" would probably be centralized because the state does not benefit from decentralization.


This is a discussion about a country adopting *Bitcoin* as the national currency. That obviously cuts out the banks *and* cuts out the government from monetary policy.

I agree there wouldn't be much of a point to pre-mining it. However a pre-mine is most analogous to the scenario OP is painting - in which a countries treasury stockpiles Bitcoins and then beggars the population by declaring it the national currency - such that their stockpile greatly increases in value. 


The entire premise of this post is that a country would do just what you are saying. Force people to use Bitcoins. This is not about natural adoption or whatever - it's about a country declaring BTC to be the national currency. My only question is if they are going to do that - why use BTC at all? In fact, why use a distributed cryptocurrency at all when a centralized "e-currency" would be basically the same thing (from the governments perspective).

The costs associated with SWIFT, and pretty much any centralized system, are *paltry* in comparison to the costs required to maintain and defend the Bitcoin network. Remember, Bitcoin is the largest dedicated computer network on earth and it uses that power to process 3 transactions a second. That's abysmal. It is simply *not* efficient *objectively*. Even if you increase the transactions per block it's still orders of magnitude less efficient than something centralized like SWIFT or VISA.

It'll be worth something. Just like the Argentine Peso and Russian Ruble still had *some* value after their relative governments defaulted.
More importantly, a weaker currency is probably what Greece *needs* right now. Under the euro scheme they had an unnaturally strong currency that gave them buying power but mad their exports more expensive. This benefited Germany and France at the expense of Greece and has brought us to this point.

You're missing the point. If the thief puts a sufficiently large fee on his first TX to move all the funds no matter what you do you aren't going to win. A miners behavior relative to a 100 BTC fee and a 100,000 BTC fee is the same - pick it up immediately.

I personally think you've read into the OPs premise to far. A country stockpiling BTC and then "adopting" it implies the perpetuation of a state apparatus *not* the formation of a decentralized government. Otherwise who or what is accruing this wealth?


I also disagree with this. As long as the state exists they'd still be able to audit businesses and extract taxation and reporting of salaries. So long as the state can do this they can collect taxes. In fact a public ledger of transactions might make this job *easier* for them (when compared to trying to tax cash transactions which have no direct record).

Yeah. If they violate the 4th amendment and find out your a drug lord and then go about building a legitimate case to convict you. I'm pretty sure they are in trouble for violating your rights...but I'm also pretty sure you're still on the hook for being a drug lord.

I agree. I'm just pointing out that the unit cost of currency is largely irrelevant. The new Greek currency will be weak - which is probably what they need to get their economy back on track. There is a reason that the Chinese keep their currency artificially low.

If you have a known number of fixed nodes then transactions can be directly verified with one another to check to consistency. You wouldn't need to having mining or a blockchain as we currently known it. 


Everything Bitcoin will ever do will be far more inefficient than a potential centralized solution. This inefficiency is simply the cost of decentralization (and one that many feel is worth paying). A centralized solution wouldn't need to have sidechains or various solutions that piggy back on the Bitcoin network. You could just create dedicated systems for that because the cost of running and defending those systems would be extremely small (relative to the Bitcoin network).

The same way all national currencies have value. Legal tender, taxation, and the mass adoption that comes about as a result of the former.

Anarcho-Capitalism: Private property (defined as property which one claims ownership over despite not currently occupying or working it) can justifiably be defended by force.
Traditional left-libertarian anarchy: Private Property cannot be justifiably defended by force.
Those two premises necessarily lead to most of the differences in the ideologies. If you can't own a "means of production" (a factory for example) by physically defending it then you can't, by definition, have Capitalism. You will necessarily have some form of Socialism where they who work the means of production own it.

Why do you need miners *at all* when you can just centrally manage it.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:38:53


I mean my example was a bit hyperbolic because there are many reasons why a piece of evidence can be nonadmissable. Parallel construction doesn't *always* mean your 4th amendment rights have been violated. Though I do believe that the example I gave would still have you on the hook for whatever they accused you of. I may be wrong about that.
More often than not parallel construction is a tool used to obfuscate how law enforcement found out about a crime. For example an undercover agent *could* legally testify in court but would jeopardieze his mission (and safety). So rather than just use his testimony the prosecution goes about building a case that leads up to the information he would have provided but without actually using him. In the case of the Ross Ulbricht trial.

If we're talking about a scenario 5 years out from now will any of the existing "consumer" hardware even be relevant anymore? We've already seen a great deal of centralization due to ASICs. As the miners get more efficient and it becomes more essentially impossible to ROI at the consumer level - won't the hardware available to the "5%ers" simply be insufficient?

Honestly, probably not. Ross's stash has been *effectively* out of the market for months/years.

Money that isn't circulating has limited immediate impact on the price.

That depends on what you see as the benefits of digital currency. If your only interest is being able to seamlessly send values electronically then a government issued currency is totally sufficient. If you are interested in decentralizing money and breaking government control of monetary policy then a government coin is pointless.
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:41:28


They can already control it directly. Quantitative Easing is the government conjuring new money out of thin air and injecting it into the economy. Interest rates are simply another tool the government uses to control the money supply.

If it would make you feel better we can use the term e-currency or digital currency. And yes centralized digital currencies have existed (e-gold).

You're assuming that a nation would actually *need* to secure their currency with a network of miners managing a distributed ledger. However if the currency is being issued and controlled by a government then you don't need any of that. The government centrally manages the currency with regular ole databases. No need for 6+ confirmations, peta hashses of computing power, or anything like that.

You could always spend and re-buy. I.e.: spend the $100 of BTC and then re-buy that same amount using fiat.
Of course this raises the very real question of "why not just buy what you want with fiat in the first place". If you find, for the majority of transactions, there is no compelling reason to do it in BTC...then what's the point.

Out of curiosity how long would it take to use Bitcoin vs the wire transfer? Presumably your Egyptian client has no Bitcoins and will therefore need to buy some. Doesn't this require a wire transfer to an exchange? Similarly once you've received the Bitcoins won't you need to cash out on an exchange which will additional time for the fiat to be sent to your accounts?
What would the end to end turnaround of Fiat -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; Fiat be for an international transfer like this? Would it be more or less than 4 days?
Would a provider like Coinbase or Bitpay be able to work internationally with an Egyptian client (specifically one with no Credit Card)

@_date: 2015-02-24 22:33:27


You are aware that *fiat* currencies don't need to be transacted within borders right? Like there are central American countries whose national currency is the US Dollar. 


Bitcoin doesn't "decentralize all the things". It decentralizes *one* thing - money creation. Hell it doesn't even necessarily decentralize payments because the transaction volume it supports is insufficient to handle all commerce. *Centralized* payments processes (coinbase, changetip, etc) need to be built on top of the protocol. 
In the same way that a country can [outsource it's monetary policy to another entity]( a country could adopt bitcoin as a currency while still maintaining the state.


No they don't. They just need to work with the sources of your income. Wal Mart is not going to jeopardize their position by not reporting your income, via W2, to the government. The same goes for pretty much any business. If you own your own business then you can certainly fudge the numbers - but I think you are greatly underestimating how audits work.
Also you misunderstand how a tax audit works. It's not a criminal proceeding where you are "innocent until proven guilty". The burden of proof is on the taxpayer to prove their income is what they say it is.

It implies that the software uses cryptography to secure transactions and manage the creation of new units. IMO this doesn't necessarily limit it to only distributed coins.
Regardless I think my point still stands. A government could easily issue their own digital currency which would give them added control over their monetary policy while providing many of the user benefits of BTC.
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:54:12
Maybe. But the miner/incentive issue is irrelevant if a nation issues it's own digital currency.

Parallel construction exists to bypass the fruit of the poisonous tree issue. If you gain knowledge through an NSA wiretap (for example) you need to "re-gain" that knowledge through legitimate means or else all subsequent evidence is inadmissible.

You view of "cryptocurrency" is too limited. A government could easily create an electronic currency that is central or semi-distributed network. This would allow them full control of monetary policy *and* would replicate the majority of Bitcoins usable features. This would be sufficient for the vast majority of people who do not care about Austrian Economics.

But that doesn't require decentralization. SWIFT, for example, is a financial communications protocol which many institutions leverage. It is privately managed. 3rd part devs and institutions leveraging a system just need an API.


That's my point. A government issuing a digital currency is not interested in decentralization and will therefore not need to use a blockchain. 


Double spends are *purely* an issue with decentralization. In a centralized solution this is a simple database lookup.
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:48:30
Doesn't matter. All the benefits that are being discussed (appreciation due to the need for citizenry to pay taxes, requirements for other nations to do business with them) are purely the result of the country declaring, by *fiat*, Bitcoin as the national currency.
The argument is essentially that the country piggy back onto Bitcoin, acquire a stockpile before the decree (analogous to a premine), make the decree, and watch their wealth grow. If that would work they could do the same without using Bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:36:28


If you've given up on decentralization then the ledger could be managed much more efficiently through a traditional database.
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:07:05
Why would the country use Bitcoin instead of "pre-mining" their own altcoin? Whatever logic you're using still holds with the alt. The only difference is that Bitcoin has some base value ($230 per coin) while the alt will start at 0. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:01:08
The country *wants* to fiddle with the knobs. And the average citizen largely does not care that their government are...knob fiddlers. The ability to manage monetary policy is an argument *for* the creation of a national alt and against the use of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:44:31
I feel like a lot of people are missing the point of the blockchain. You have blockchains because of a need for decentralization. If we are talking about the government issuing and controlling a currency that's just a database. No need for miners at all.

For Quantitative Easing? It's extremely direct. The bank conjures money out of thin air and uses it to buy something you are selling. You now have the money.


I disagree. Even if they used a digital currency they would probably use the same method as above to introduce new currency. The reason why is because the above transaction is reversible. If the economy starts to experience price inflation you *sell* the instrument you bought and "destroy" or "warehouse" the money you originally injected.

That's still largely true if they use Bitcoin. Yes there are people who buy Bitcoin now. No there aren't that many of them. If a country adopted Bitcoin the average person would still have no reason to buy Bitcoin. Its the same reason I don't hold Euros - I have no business with Europe and therefore Euros are not useful to me. 
The fact that a niche community already uses Bitcoin is not a compelling argument that adopting Bitcoin would be materially different *for the country* from creating a national digital currency.

I imagine you'll find different groups of people buying on the highs and laughing on the lows.

@_date: 2013-12-18 18:34:38


How are you getting that. Hedge Funds are not passive investments. They are actively managed by Traders who look to time the market (or exploit mispricings) to generate returns. They'll actively trade BTC - buying when they think the price is low and selling when they think the price is too high. In this case an investor in the fund would give them $x00,000 and say "make me money" - which means buying and selling at optimal times...not just sitting on a position forever.


A large hedge fund could, in theory, find a way to bet against the price of Bitcoins (I believe some brokers offer futures contracts on BTC and I think at least on supports borrowing BTC which facilitates shorting). They could then try and create an environment that drives the price of BTC down (maybe sell large amounts of coin to spook people into liquidating...further driving down the prices).


This would be more in line with an ETF which sets an index (in this case the price of BTC) and allows people to pool their money and invest in that index. In this case as more people invest their money they fund buys more BTC and as people sell their holdings the fund liquidates BTC (very simplified but that's the general idea).
