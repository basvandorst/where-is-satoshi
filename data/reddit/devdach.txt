Oh sorry that i forgot to write that bitcoin is not affected by it ....

The quantum exists already for decades or milenia, we are lucky that the universe is structured.

please add vircurex.com, - it is the largest cryptocoin exchange

@_date: 2013-04-06 22:30:00
thank you! how about to connect it with bitcoin-abe ?  ?
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:42:54
Thats the good thing, its never to late, devcoin has no generation limit or halving
@_date: 2013-09-19 11:42:42
its about risks of bitcoin not ban/regulate

Well i would say dont trust anyone but here some material for study:
Its interesting that soon after she went public, the BIS came out with this:

im not that sure that this is realy just about soccer only, and i doubt that this has advertising purposes. I dnt think that Mr. Beckenbauer is loco.

I set the timemark to 30:41 but listen the whole interview
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:17:57
Awesome, TY!
Can you please make a version with Europe or even Asia?
@_date: 2013-07-14 18:07:48
i disagree with you :)  Why should it not become capable of rewriting in future? I guess the therm DVD is confusing, i was refering to the size of the object, not to the capabilities of it.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:41:01
So in the good old days the currency was a commodity?
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:15:29
 SS: There are liberty movements that are actually picking up now, the likes of Bitcoin, for example. Can they ever grow into a solid rival to the conventional system?
KH: I think they’re going to be a force to be reckoned with, yes. It’s a matter of fact. There are other similar kinds of payment systems that are now gaining currency. Yes, I think we’re going to have a world where there’s a lot of choice and the legal tender is not going to be used to put people into debt and to imprison them. 
 SS: Are you using a Bitcoin as of now?
KH: That’s a good question. I’m trying to learn how. There is a conference that is taking place and I’m going to try to get myself sorted out on that.
SS: Karen, thank you very much for your time. That’s all for today. Our guest was a former insider at the World Bank, ex-senior counsel Karen Hudes. Thanks for watching and we will see next time here in SophieCo. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 08:41:09
Your idea is allready reality since years, try devcoin
@_date: 2013-09-19 11:44:19
No, money laundring is taking place on the highest levels, with billions of fiat. Bitcoin is uninteresting for the real drugdealers.

The project has since start June 30, 2012 all white status and the operator is premium verified. Please have a look in the trading and dividends history. GMP is powered by hydropower.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:31:49
 will be sufficiently fast enough for the given needs
@_date: 2013-01-22 21:21:21
yes right; you get GMP shares on cryptostocks.com and profit from the mining dividends weekly.
@_date: 2013-01-22 00:24:50
Never spend more than you can afford. I made my best expirience with BTC stocks on cryptostocks.com

Good job for a 16 years old! Here is the reason for you to have bitcoins:

you can reach your goal more simple:

Its realy awesome to own a Cybertool in the modern world. I never had the need to use any other tool, to open my mac, pc or laptop :) 
@_date: 2013-07-13 21:50:10
AMD, Intel or Samsung are not realy a key player in the Bitcoin economy. When the Bitcoin comunity is able to produce with the actual lithography 28nm, then they are able to build it with quantum lithography probably sooner then later.

@_date: 2013-04-12 22:19:59
It helped to my understanding to see the whole Cryptocurency image, not just one Chain :)
@_date: 2013-02-13 02:52:31
You see that your argumentation ends here, cause there is no maybe or what if, fact is you can get precious metals today for bitcoin, so why shouldnt you get it in future ?
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:54:57
it allready exists  not sure if gonna cover that to
@_date: 2013-07-24 23:24:07
Thank you! Team Avalon!
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:54:22
Any Cryptocoins are a commodity not a currency! A currency is something issued by a Central Bank. Even if you can use it for currency purposes, doesnt make it a currency!
@_date: 2013-07-13 22:09:22
Quantum litho is a research technology on the horizon.. According to wikipedia that is for the most western countries probably right.

i found that one here:

The BIS was originally intended to facilitate reparations imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles after World War I: 
.... the last payments was done on 3 October 2010:  
I can only agree on the fact that the BIS is obsolete and the further existence is same disruptive for our presence like bitcoin is disruptive for the fiat economy. Everyone is aware of this fact. Like President Maurer said: We should finaly start to realise the difference between value and price: 
@_date: 2013-07-14 18:44:11
Everything does start somewhere, somehow :)
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:55:41
Your idea is only possible when you use the namecoin chain for your purpose.

@_date: 2013-01-22 00:56:54
by now it is 60 GH/s/400 KW  but since there are inprovements possible  ...
looking forward for more information.
Just this:
Let's put it this way, room temp is 25C, on MAX LOAD for 40 hours in a room-size machine made for "burn-in" testing, we are looking at 48.xC top tempature, we actually removed 2 fans from the case lol.
As soon the GMP Project gets its trade-in AVALON ASICS in batch2 there gonna be tests and reports from this 
@_date: 2013-11-01 22:17:11
My attention is pointed on what she meantioned about "Rule of Law" I agree on the fact that we dont need destruction. Since Cryptochains are "Rule of Law", everyone on this planet has a very elegant third party free access to this principle.

I guess Silver/BTC is prefered:
Coins of the Swiss Confederation:
In 1850, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 centimes and ½, 1, 2, and 5 francs, with the 1 and 2 centimes struck in bronze, the 5, 10, and 20 centimes in billon (with 5% to 15% silver content), and the franc denominations in .900 fine silver. Between 1860 and 1863, .800 fine silver was used, before the standard used in France of .835 fineness was adopted for all silver coins except the 5 francs (which remained .900 fineness) in 1875.
 Banks there are still accepting Silver with certificates today.

somehow this expresses the feeling i had while reading this message :) 
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:55:36
The real question is, how does this event affect Bitcoin. I guess we will know more after November 11.
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:13:22
Well first you need to root your android :) And other linux distros are allso possible.

GMP is about to trade-in 5 Lancelot FPGA Boards for AVALON ASIC. av. 300 GH/s by now with batch2 (March 1. 2013). There is room for more and you can become part of it with your own GMP shares.

@_date: 2013-07-14 18:38:03
I guess the big players see it similar:
@_date: 2013-08-07 18:02:22
YES, do you mean the Soldatenmesser 08 or all products from Victorinox and Wenger in general?. I guess the various Cybertool models are prefered in various colors, but the Soldatenmesser 08 would be nice to get for Cryptocoins. To accept Devcoin payment would be s beschti :)
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:39:11
Payment for work is realized trough DEVCOIN 
@_date: 2013-02-13 03:17:20
Yes thats evolution, there was a day when steam driven devices was exchanged with fuel burning devices aswell.
@_date: 2013-10-08 09:05:11
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:43:59
So coins are not mined by mines, but by the Central Bank of Blockchain?
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:09:18
thank you!
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:08:07
I dnt think so, here in Switzerland mobile phone payment should be avalable by January 2014
@_date: 2013-05-20 08:45:18
Bitcoin will embrace quantum computing. Quantum Etanglement will make bitcoin even more secure :) Watch this:

Try cryptostocks.com &gt;  actualy running constant with 3 gh/s.
GMP holds a trade-in position for at least 5 AVALON ASICS.
This position of the project is gained trough the early investment and support of the Lancelot project in 2012, the predecessor of AVALON.

Well i dont care about up or downvoting, but thank you :)
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:05:40
its doable, thats all :) 
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:35:55
Thanks for the clarification ;)
@_date: 2013-08-07 18:35:55
Sounds great! Please have a look in the devcoin thread, when you have trouble with implenting it.  not sure if there is still a bounty for devcoin vendors. How good is the engraving? Are you able to engrave this logo 
@_date: 2013-02-13 01:59:01
right, but see it from the standpoint not to need to convert dollars to bitcoins first...
@_date: 2013-05-24 15:32:03
Thanks for your Book!
