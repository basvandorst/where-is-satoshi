yea it's so easy to say that though. I mean there's predictions of it getting to 40-50k by end of 2018 why not dump everything in now

what a time to be alive 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:30:27
yea same thing happened to me so i just bit the bullet and did the direct buy with the small fee pretty sure i've made it back by now since i got in aroudn 12k

is something going on with GDAX? i had some limit orders that didn't fill when the price went beyond the limit and now i can't cancel it. My BTC is in some sort of gdax limbo 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:28:18
ah so it really is in a limbo once you reach limit until there's an available maker for the order? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:06:58
i mean there is a USD value associated with that, so it could come tothat

yea it's hard to see how bitcoin could be used daily because of how volatile it is. I would assume the places that take it would inflate it one way or the other to minimize their risk, like if you're paying with a foreign currency in another country

Yep exactly what’s happening with mine super frustrating 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:20:48
has your order eventually gone through? Kind of funny because it did say nilled when it first loaded the page, then it re-appeared and i couldn't cancel it or have the funds in the tank 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:36:35
Yea mine just filled and says in my history that it was done 20 minutes ago

it's more of their entire family becoming addicted to drugs and the constant threat on your life, but yea if that's already happening in your life then it is easier to deal with that in a porsche

we kind of have been, this is like ground hogs day 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:47:56

@_date: 2018-02-06 18:43:24
