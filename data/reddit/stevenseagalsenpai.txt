it did have some valid criticism in it

hmm, didn't notice that. Well my father was a butcher, so I don't know, he probably left his mark on me.

let's face it Bitfinex started from Bitcoinica's souce, it was bound to fail, it's just amazing they got this far. Kudos to them.

thank God I had done some research before using it
and I never kept my usd/btc ,
there where three red flags for me
1) the developer looked like a total goofball with very little experience
SITE IS WRITTEN IN RUBY( very slow, no wonder site was lagging frequently)!
also because it  started as a direct clone from the bitcoinica( another site that got hacked and lost hundreds of thousands, it was coded by a 17yo old chinese with no sense of security lol) hacked source code, and still had multiple 
ruby vulns and stuff, plus the admin page is publicly available to anyone and they use a ruby cms plugin 
that is known to be prone to vulns
3) an assessment someone had written long before stamp and bfx got hacked

export my private keys, yeah, stop being so anal
can I export my wallet or not?
@_date: 2016-07-19 20:41:57
How do I export my address? Do you have the username of the blackchain support?
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:54:49
this is a very bad idea, the main reason I use
blockchain is because the ui is/was so simplistic and easy
are there any alternatives out there with simplistic UI?
How do I even import an address to the new wallet now? The UI 
is all over the place.

what about exporting? this is so confusing, the old wallet was simple and easy to use
how did they manage to mess up the new wallet so much...
