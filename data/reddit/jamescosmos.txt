dunno, do I need a ruler for that or is it sumthing for compasses?

My question was "how to do a stop loss AND a take profit. I figured out how to do one of them, I need both...
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:38:32
Thanks, that makes perfect sense. Hm, I do want to invest but I think I wait a bit and see if the price drops above the previous low. Since I am not planning to day trade or hold the position for like only a few weeks, I think I can afford a small mistake.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:02:46
And what if I also want a take profit? SL is only half the trade.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:29:17
I understand that my still limited knowledge is getting in the way while I learn this. So my question afterwards was meant for people who know. Particularly what _they_ think the reasons would be for a fall or rise.

Is it actually possible/recommended to send money to a proper exchange and buy BTC and then send it from the exchange to your private wallet? Because I already have a verified account on a trading exchange it might be more convenient. Would I be able to sell the same way by sending from my personal wallet to the exchange? I think this would double my fees though.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:29:47
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:30:18
So no stop loss or take profit?
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:22:11
Hm, this is a bit too technical for me... I see BitPay secures the Wallet with a 12 word passphrase but it won't get you anywhere if their service shuts down and you need your private key, right? Is there any simple way of buying Bitcoins, putting them in a Wallet that gives you the private key (if that is really the only way to be sure long-term) to then sell them later at an exchange? Again, I'm sorry I ask these questions vaguely so often but I just don't want to do anything wrong I will regret when it's too late and I already made an investment. Please bare with me...

Thank you for all your help, this was awesome. I will try it now myself, and maybe ask in this thread if more questions come up.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:12:25
This doesn't answer the question whether a wallet will be good enough for long term investing, or if a proper exchange with extensive charting utilities is needed.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:11:25
Thank you for the detailed reply! I don't have any leverage but think I will close 50% of my position on the 31st just to be sure.

Does a Wallet come into play here at all or will it be the Wallet the exchange provides? And how do I make sure the hard fork doesn't screw me over? As far I understand a Wallet can be by a third party but you have to buy the coins on an exchange. I'm sorry if this is basic knowledge, I just don't get the relations between the two. Are you saying I can buy the coins anywhere, put them anywhere, hold them for as long as I want, and then sell later? How would you do that - any advice?

Ah okay, so I transfer the coins from Paymium to my Wallet and keep them there? But then I can't invest - I would need to keep the coins on an exchange, right?

I am so confused, especially with this hard fork situation... Maybe you can tell me if what I said is correct and if Paymium is a good way to invest. Thanks so much!
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:38:12
So wait, either way I cannot go into debt on Kraken (I don't trade leverage)? And they will never force you to pay back the loss?
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:16:47
Can't I just register for a wallet, put some money into it and sell a year later without going through any exchanges? (all done from a wallet like at Paymium)
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:50:47
Great, thanks! Any last recommendations for a free Wallet that is safe?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:21:30
I think I'm getting it. Do most exchanges generally allow to send Bitcoins to them from any wallet? With your help I got so far: I search for an online exchange (like bitcoin.de) and buy a coin there, then I open a Wallet with another company or (preferably?) an own Paper Wallet / Cold Storage and send it there. When I want to sell, I search again for an exchange, send the coins there and sell.

Is there anything to watch out for in Wallets? Cause I could also store them with the Paymium exchange, as I think they have an online (Hot Storage) Wallet. Thanks again!

So BIP 39 isn't and never will be BIP 44 compatible even if BitPay devs implement that for their wallet? Just in case, I don't want to mess up my first wallet I create.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:10:59
That's what I did. Set up a Wallet on BitPay, did a passphrase backup which will hopefully work on other Wallets that support that protocol. One more question did come up reading about the hard fork situation: will a Wallet like BitPay get my coins on both blockchains in case of that event, or will it be like with exchanges for them to decide? What kind of Wallet (cold, hot, offline, etc.) does BitPay provide anyway? I don't think I found that keyword on their site.
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:29:16
That's what I meant. I don't need charts, just buy, hold, and sell. I'm sure I'm overthinking it but I had the impression that wallets are for paying with Bitcoin only, and has no ability to sell to the market - I thought you need a proper exchange for that. If you could clarify this I would appreciate... don't want to buy and regret later!
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:03:51
Yes that makes sense, thank you! But the question still exists: close positions on 31st just to be sure?
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:18:44
I think BitPay uses BIP 39... Will this cause problems down the road? Can they even "update" my wallet to support backup to other BIP 44 wallets? I am confused if my money is safe even if I have the phrase.

And if it doesn't, what if all wallets switch to BIP 44 and BitPay goes down?
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:29:34
But this is more than just an altcoin, right? It has the potential to replace bitcoin, not compete with it. Do you close your positions before 31st to be safe?
