How about you opensource the tech that you are trying to sell?  The tech all these websites are reviewing is closed source - rev 1.0 was a long time ago.  All this hype is just hype of what some guy says about something nobody has seen the code to.


My point was more along the lines of the group who creates a coin name from the hashing algorithm (X11coin/darkcoin) another coin created  probably doesn't have much to offer in the way of innovation.  Guess since it's closed sourced nobody knows. 




If it was one of microsofts VP's that flew the plane into the building &amp; one of MS official PR guys admitted to the terrorist still being part of the team (read Teka's second response admitted it).  Then another PR guy spent the entire interview trying to make the person who reported the plane being flown into the building look bad (Synchillis).  Then the MS employees (XC shills) cheered the terrorist action on like yours shills laughed at my greed &amp; claimed I deserved to lose money.  Then yea ... I'd take a second look at believing their closed sourced software was as private and "awesome" as they claimed it was.
I'd think they were shady as hell.

When I brought it up - I was told to take my complaints elsewhere.  So I did - I created that thread.  And honestly I was pretty shocked at how long your PR guys responded.

Lol darkcoin just opensourced.  Guess it's time for XC to follow suite.

Do you not see the irony in a developer releasing closed source software making claims about it's anonymity?  I do...

Yup - I didn't own XMR at the time I talked about that.  Look thru my post history - I created an honest XMR fud thread.  &amp; have been accused of fudding by plenty of XMR shills.
But ... their project is much different than yours.  Open source, more provable (reviewed by mathematicians, input for bitcoin developer, etc), PoW so they want to actually build an economy - not monopolize one.  A little bit of critical thinking &amp; they actually welcome my negative feedback.
Closed sourced and releasing press about the milestones you just finished is absolutely laughable in this space.

A war?  Lol dramaqueen much?  I asked for some up votes if they thought I had some valid points. 
And yes XCs "official" and unofficial responses about their then developer irked me enough to draw my attention to this coin.  Just look at some of the latest "he was stupid ... deserved to lose his money" responses on your thread.  Youll get an idea of why I don't mind calling it like i see it.
If you dig thru my post history you'll find negatives on Darkcoin too.  However it seems to me in most things at least they were original

Here is my Monero FUD thread.  I also gave XC people better FUD talking points against XMR than what they knew prior to me putting money in it.
Perhaps I will start an XC FUD thread soon.  We will see if the XC community is as open to me talking about it's weaknesses as the XMR community is :)

My closed sourced software drivers don't make the claims XC does.  Their selling point is that they work.  XC's selling point is that it's private which no one has anyway of knowing after rev 1.

web 3.0 is a buzzword now ... everybody wanting to pump their coins is jumping on the wagon o.O
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:05:25
Ethereum idea has been floating since before the first post in the X11coin thread was created.

1 - XC is mostly closed sourced.  "Delayed source" = anything even remotely innovative is closed source so there's no way to know anything.  Why would you trust your privacy to something closed sourced?  It makes no sense ... 
2 - Dan - their hero developer is constantly reviewing shitcoins -&gt; pumps them -&gt; repeats.
3 - Their community is mostly full of the same 9 people who can't wait to be rich when they take over the world.
4 - They are or were closely associated with a developer who ripped off millions of pre-orders.  Their guy Synchellis claims the guy is "doing everything he can to make it right" when in reality it's been months since he's contacted any of us.
5 - It's an instamine PoW -&gt; PoS coin.  Originally X11coin (x11coin.org) ripping off the name of the algo that darkcoin created (X11).  Now the mixer nodes requiring 1000XC in order to run in order to try and create demand for the price (another idea ripoff).  The latest has been "Web 3.0" after Ethereum started talking about it.
There are soooo many red flags on this it's like blazing red semi truck.  It has NOTHING to do with bitcoin
P.S.  I'm a jaded buyer of a pre-order litecoin ASIC from one of their devs (Jasinlee) who used to be listed as  on their website.  They said they still worked with him closely until things got hot &amp; they pulled him off the website.  Their shills still ask about the innerchain technology Jasinlee is working on for them.  Tread with caution.  
P.S.2.  Please upvote this if you are a bitcoiner 'cuz the shills will bury it otherwise.
