The quantum computing thing is a boogey man. Today, with classical computing, we can brute force a lot of encryption algos from earlier generations. Technology will evolve. The simplest scenario is as quantum computing becomes pervasive we use it to create stronger algos by doing more iterations, adding more entropy, using longer keys, etc.

Haha I think you’re thinking interGALACTIC.

This was the biggest realization I had post ATH when I finally got in. Been buying BTC and ETH $250 at a time and continue to do do. It’s a great way to average out. My first purchase was at $18.5k/BTC (����) but with conviction I kept buying and my avg is now 6.8k (����). You literally cannot do that with stock, for example AMZN requires you to buy almost 2k at a time so if you don’t time it right and don’t have tens of thousands to average out you have to risk more for potential gains.

I personally wouldn’t buy AMZN at this price or macro environment but even when bought it at $760 that was a lot of money to put down on a single share.

Few months ago trump was openly complaining about the dollar being too strong and hurting the economy. Another country does something to that effect and they are the manipulators. 
Love showing my wife our crypto rising against all this bullshit.

I probably sound like a nut for this but I believe space travel will REQUIRE an interplanetary currency that is transferable electronically and not mediated by a central party. Hmmm what currency asset allows you to do that? Space-faring explorers and space outposts are not science fiction anymore, but a reality in my lifetime. Not saying this is the reason to invest in btc but an interesting use case.
EDIT: spelling error

You sure Rh does? Had no idea

I didn’t know this. I use Robinhood because it’s commission free and my buying pattern would be expensive with commissions. Good news tho that my other brokerages (E*TRADE and Ameritrade) will be doing zero commission too soon.

What are you talking about? Bail ins are legal in US afaik. Also, you may be missing that the fed has been injecting tens of billions of dollars almost daily to create the funds necessary to facilitate lending.  The cracks in the global financial system are showing again. And for some reason everyone is sticking their heads in the sand like pre-2008.

This happened to me all early 2018 when I was “buying the dip”. Held that bag for a looooonnnng time and kept filling it but now I know better. Nibbling $100-200 at a time each dip into mid 10k.

I hadn’t looked into the times but you’re right shit, it’s still very far and impractical.

This sounds like a good explanation of why it works the way it does, but to suppose that’s the only way an economy can work is misleading. The US thrived for almost two centuries before the FED changed the game forever. USD has lost .98% of its value since then. That’s fuckin insane. The super wealthy people DONT spend their money this way, they hoard it just like we’re doing with BTC. So the system doesn’t always work as intended.

This passes off as a study? How many geniuses and how many hours did it take to come up with this fuckery?

Wonder how much effort will be put into hacking their centralized, backdoored blockchain? I'd never own it

Pretty much sums up my experience all 2018

Yea I got the reference, I think it's a stupid argument. Everyone has gotten burned investing. not much you can do if you believe in something then the founder turns out to be a lying fraudster. Maybe that's why he believes so strongly in bitcoin. It's provably incorruptible.

That's hilarious, how long did it take for your company to be to become profitable?  And how many users actively use your product? Yea he's a fucking idiot... /s

Not to mention he runs an entire other company in a different industry. Complete imbecil that Dorsey guy

What's your point?

Had the same thing happen to me with Gemini.  They asked if I was conducting business with the crypto I bought there and about the source of the funds used.
@_date: 2019-04-15 20:08:10
Sold mine and bought more btc

Yup all their understanding was based on FUD inducing clickbait headlines.
