I also had your doubt and this site helped me:
"SegWit is short for segregated witnesses and it is a proposal presented by the Bitcoin Core team. It comes in the form of a soft fork, an upgrade that can work even if some users don't update their software.
In transactions there are three key elements. The sender, receiver and the signatures (commonly referred to as witnesses) and these make up a big part of the transaction size. Contrary to popular belief, however, SegWit does not seperate this witness data into a “witness block”.
Instead, Segwit updates the 1MB block size limit into a 4 million unit block weight limit, counting serialised witness data as one unit and core block data as four units. It essentially introduces a new transaction format.
What this means is that the block size is actually increased. SegWit counts each byte in a witness as 0.25 bytes towards the maximum block size limit (1MB), meaning the maximum size of a block becomes just under 4MB. This doesn’t mean that the data gets smaller, it simply means that it is counted in a way that allows for the 1MB limit to be increased. This change, however, only affects witness data and each non-witness byte is still counted as 1 byte towards the maximum block size limit (1MB) or as 4 units towards a maximum block weight of 4M units."

Does anyone know how does the IRS works for non-US coinbase customers?

Looking good! What website is that?

Thanks, really hope he's right! :P
On what ground he did those projections?

A transaction can expire, and after it happens, the balance is added back to your wallet.
This delay is probably because you didn't include a large enough miner's fee. Just wait it out.

Exactly what I thought. Thanks.

I've bought btc a little over $1000, $1150 i think. Regret nothing, and remember for the long run it's always a good time to buy btc :)

Can you tell if he got right past projections?

Hi, I'm also a EU member and I've been using Coinbase since I've started buying BTC and ETH in order to hold it as an investment. Buy &amp; hold
What everyone advises is to just use the exchange to buy and sell crypto and then transfer it out of it, for security reasons. (Although for coinbase some say it's way more secure than the other exchanges, don't really know why, sorry.)
As for the hardware wallet, it's a great choice, safer than a virtual wallet, just make sure you don't loose it :P
And you also have an other great wallet called ledger wallet, multi currency, and pretty affordable.

It won't matter because you won't have your coins sitting around in the exchange, it will be get in -&gt; buy -&gt; transfer to wallet -&gt; get out. Probably the only difference will be the price.

$5k seems a bit ambitious to me... but hey it's BTC, all kinds of magic might occur.

I'm still hodl, been holding since 940, a bought more a little over $1000. It's always a good time to buy btc :)

Last couple of weeks have been crazy for exchanges, specially Coinbase and Kraken, give it some time, the bitcoin isn't lost, if they reject it, it will bounce back.

Sorry I'm not understanding, what does "factor out the bubbles" mean or does to a currency like btc?
