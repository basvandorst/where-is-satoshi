You're basing this on what, that gimmicky video that was released when btc was tanking and bch surging so they had to pull the emergency lever with that goofy demo?  It's still infinitely far from integrating with the actual blockchain.  Granted, I am pulling all of this out of my ass, but I do feel it to be true and I'm sure others can verify me.

Who are the big boys in this case? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:16:12
ShapeShift implemented it.  Didn't help much.  I can see why all these other companies are jumping on it. Lulz

Pretty much.. why get Jews involved tho? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:40:51
Riiight. How much did roger ver pay you? Lemme guess I should buy some bcash? 
LN is coming soon don't worry about it.

But doesn't any coin get more decentralized the more adopted it gets? More use more mining more nodes, no?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:19:45
Gasp! Guards?!?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:29:07
Step 1. Hodl
Step 2. Wait for LN
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:53:12
LN is just a concept... and block size needs to dramatically increase anyway for LN to support global adoption.. *facepalm* 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:59:11
Amazon.com has a huge chunk? What does that mean.. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:23:26
It's been proven to death that bigger blocks are a non issue.  I'm sorry these discussions aren't allowed behind this iron curtain.  Yes a lot of powerful people are threatened by jihan but mining centralization is inevitable anyway.  51% attacks are a concern if it's a government that wants to undermine Bitcoin, I don't see jihan having any incentive to undermine himself.  If btc is such a secure store of value why is everyone so freaked out by bch? Relax guys LN is coming soon ;)

Thank you for this answer. 
Can you describe a scenario where a tipping point is reached where a central controller can now alter the ledger to cheat the system and no one will know? I need a clear picture of this scenario.. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:30:00
Hmm I guess they're just lazy... or did jihan pay them all off? What's your theory of why it's not getting adopted? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:40:51
Dude I'm well aware of the narrative that's been crammed down your throat, you don't have to regurgitate it for me.  All I want is honest discussion, the problem is you get the ban hammer for "trolling" on this sub.  Only posts that slander anything bch associated or memes get to the front page... hmm I wonder what effect that's had on your perception of what's happening?
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:27:27
Blasphemy. A ban for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:06:42
It says he's a contributor, which means it's not forbes. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:25:04
Wait so you're saying paying $30 fees isn't a major incentive? Are you a billionaire or something? 
So like will amazon be a lightning hub and people pay whatever fee to open a channel with them or any other channel connected to them so they can then spend Bitcoin tokens.. is there a way to top up your channel without reaching for more btc out from the blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:35:16
What will prevent people from say hacking LN and just creating more lightning tokens?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:14:10
It seems too technically complicated for adoption tbh... I mean if segwit only has 10% adoption at this point can we realistically assume LN will be more successful? I think we should just keep higher fees and let the rich duke it out for block space.

Link plz
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:55:35
Idk it seems like they're backing forks that are getting them out of the mess core created. SEEMS to me but what do I know.  Seems like this sub is trying so hard to force adoption of a system that no one wants.. and it's about to get steamrolled by the original plan? Like I said idk what's going on.  I'm just a dumdum
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:49:26
And this will make central banking obsolete how?
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:13:01
Many do think block size increase is a sustainable path, i.e. Satoshi Nakamoto.  This doesn't bode well with central banks, who are financing the influencers of core.  But I'm just a shill, what do I know.  Look at the downvotes for this post, don't listen to me!

People generally don't like coercion
