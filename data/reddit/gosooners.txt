He hated Krugman long before Bitcoin existed. Bitcoin simply fits perfectly into his well known world view.
Check out the Deep Capture blog and some of the other links posted here in the comments.
He believes what he is saying. I don't have any doubt about that.

I've got a man crush on Patrick Byrne!

Thanks for this. Very helpful to me as I try to figure this out.
Question: Doesn't the Seller have to provide TWO pubkeys, and the Buyer have to calculate TWO stealth addresses?
Perhaps that is excluded for ease of understanding, or I am misunderstanding (entirely possible).
As I read the orginal paper and subsequent discussion on Sourceforge, the second key is strictly for the purpose of allowing the Seller to locate the Txn in the blockchain using a private key that doesn't make the coins in the Txn spendable.

Agreed. Patrick Byrne is signing up for Bitcoin on principle, not as a cheap marketing tactic. I've been following him for a long time. Basically, he is a Libertarian and Austrian economist, and a bit of a renegade. For all these reasons, I bet he loves Bitcoin and wants to help it succeed. All the better if it helps his company succeed as well!
I shop at Overstock specifically because of him, and I will do so even more now.

I don't know if this is true, but I've been following Patrick Byrne's blog for several years. He is a really interesting and smart guy.
blog: [
I actually hadn't been there is several months, so I just hopped over and did a search for "bitcoin" and got zero results.
Read a few articles on his blog, and you'll quickly see he's not your typical CEO. He has been on a CRUSADE against a practice called "naked short selling" for years, which is why I started following him.
He is the type of guy who might embrace Bitcoin for anti-establishment reasons. Wouln't surprise me at all that he would be one of the first big company CEO's to embrace Bitcoin.
That said, I was surprised to find no mention of it on Deep Capture.
I hope this is true.
Don't know if this article is true, but Patrick Byrne is awesome and exactly the kind of leader who might embrace it.

Just listened to the audio that was added to the article, and that is exactly what I would've expected to hear from Patrick Byrne. Whether or not he is successful in getting it implemented in Overstock, I am very excited to hear this!
I started following him during my "Ron Paul days" back during his 2008 presidential campaign. I got sentimental hearing Mr. Byrne mention Austrian economics.
