Volatility is apparently solved by being able to change bitcoin into bitUSD and other marketpegged assets that are 3 times collateralised on the bitshares blockchain, so that people do not have to leave the crypto-ecosystem but are protected against volatility. More info can be found in this reddit-post:

decentralized exchanges por favor:

oh boy, maybe you should read the article as it deals with the issue of decentralised exchanges or maybe you want things to stay the same and that people keep losing money because they give up their money and acccept  IOU's from a CENTRALISED exchange instead of trading with IOU's that are fully (300%) collateralized on a blockchain...

If you want to stay in the crypto-sphere, possible options would be: BitGold, BitUSD, BitCNY whatever asset, currency you feel most comfortable with.

let's do a thought experiment:
suppose a pegged crypto-dollar gets a stable value because of the way it’s created and destroyed: It’s created by people who are betting that the backing cryptocurrency will increase in value versus dollars in the next thirty days. The speculator effectively makes a short trade on margin by putting up collateral of $2 worth of the backing cryptocurrency to create $1 of a pegged crypto-dollar. That 1 pegged crypto-dollar is purchased for the equivalent amount of the backing cryptocurrency (let’s say that’s 100 of the backing cryptocurrency, for example), then the pegged crypto-dollar is released into the economy for trade. Now there’s 300 of the backing cryptocurrency of collateral worth three times the value of a dollar locked on the blockchain. If the value of the backing cryptocurrency drops too much, the blockchain forces the speculator to buy  a pegged crypto-dollar with the locked collateral, which destroys the pegged crypto-dollar and results in a loss for the speculator—she’ll pay 120 of the backing cryptocurrency for a pegged crypto-dollar and only have 180 left instead of the 200 she put in. If the value of the backing cryptocurrency goes up, the speculator can realize her gains by buying a pegged crypto-dollar, destroying it, and keeping the remaining collateral—she’ll pay 80 of the backing cryptocurrency for a pegged crypto-dollar and have 220 left, more than the 200 she put in. These trades result in a crypto-USD with a stable value. Anyone who wants stable value puts in $1 of the backing cryptocurrency and gets $1 of the backing cryptocurrency out, backed by the speculators and the backing cryptocurrency’ open source, auditable algorithm.

The innner bitshares-exchange where you can trade fully collateralised market pegged assets like bitBTC (which tracks the price of bitcoin) without counterparty risk on the blockchain. I think the discussion here is quite interesting:

take your money elsewhere I would say

It indeed describes bitshares/bitUSD, but it seems as soon as you mention be it bitshares or Nubits or any other cryptocurrency there is no room left to debate the ideas/innovations behind it...but this seems to have gotten a discussion going

Nice to hear Eric Voorhees talk positive of bitUSD and bitshares

Is he saying do what BitShares is doing with its BitUSD? But take Bitshares out of the equation and change it for Bitcoin? Is this so easily done?
