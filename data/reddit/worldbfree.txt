must *have, but no. it was that post (which honestly is just more of the same old nothing that you all think is something) that brought me back to this looney bin.  
last year at the end of the year, this sub asked for predictions for the price on 12/31/14.  
i said $50, but the next day i reconsidered and said $500 because i realized i was underestimating the death grip of the desperate and delusional - right now it's around $350. they will just keep on holding on to nothing...at least for a while. there comes a point when you gotta put this nonsense away.  
none of these winklevoss, overstock, microsoft posts have meant or will mean shit.   
please do yourself a favor and join the real world. bitcoin isn't going to do anything. or if you must persist, then remember this post and revisit it on this date next year, and if you're still delusional, then the year after that, but after a while you're going to have to come back to reality. the sooner the better. good luck

how is it supposed to be taxed?
The capital gain rules for precious metals are very clear, especially if you’re a US taxpayer. But the IRS has literally issued ZERO guidance on Bitcoin.
If, for example, Bitcoin is considered a ‘currency’ by the IRS, then Bitcoin gains should be taxed as ordinary income according to IRC section 988(a)(1)(A).
But if Bitcoins are considered to be a long-term investment, such as shares of Google that you hold for more than a year, than it should be taxed at lower capital gains rates.
And what about if your Bitcoins are stolen? Are such losses deductible like other investment losses? Or would it be treated like personal property as if your car was stolen?
And what if you’re a US taxpayer holding Bitcoins at an overseas-based brokerage? Would this ‘account’ need to be reported on foreign financial disclosure forms?
Everything is up in the air. And while the IRS has issued fairly clear guidance on precious metals, they haven’t made a peep about Bitcoin… leaving, once again, the onus on the taxpayer to figure everything out.

 The capital gain rules for precious metals are very clear, especially if you’re a US taxpayer. But the IRS has literally issued ZERO guidance on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-12-14 05:14:03
I'm guessing that's part of what the recent $25m is for. I emailed asking when I was going to get my coin, and I had already gotten it, sold back out and had the money in my bank acct for a few days till they sent me some canned reply about how it takes 3-4 bus days to get your coin. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:35:08
I would convert 100 to USD. If you really think they are going to be huge, then 70 will be great for your future....that future could be awhile. But $70-100k will be great for you right now. You've already gotten the big ride, that game is over, you won.

Global Economy = $78T  
2014  Bitcoins= 13M  
Max value 1BTC = $ 6M   
  
Optomistic 2014 coin value of 0.1% of global economy = $6k
0.1% of 7B people is 7m people, which some claim is current hoarding base.  
  
But many facets of the game need to be opened up if the world is to have great and easy access to BTC.  
People who want it can't even get it because it's such a hassle, let alone using it for commerce instead of holding it for investment.

I don't really see Bitcoin really getting off the ground ever.
I previously predicted in the other "Predictions for 2014" thread, that I thought BTC would be $50 on 12/31/14. I am now willing to say it may be as high as $500 because of the big-ass stalled wartheads in denial limbo.

The capital gain rules for precious metals are very clear, especially if you’re a US taxpayer. But the IRS has literally issued ZERO guidance on Bitcoin.
If, for example, Bitcoin is considered a ‘currency’ by the IRS, then Bitcoin gains should be taxed as ordinary income according to IRC section 988(a)(1)(A).
But if Bitcoins are considered to be a long-term investment, such as shares of Google that you hold for more than a year, than it should be taxed at lower capital gains rates.
And what about if your Bitcoins are stolen? Are such losses deductible like other investment losses? Or would it be treated like personal property as if your car was stolen?
And what if you’re a US taxpayer holding Bitcoins at an overseas-based brokerage? Would this ‘account’ need to be reported on foreign financial disclosure forms?
Everything is up in the air. And while the IRS has issued fairly clear guidance on precious metals, they haven’t made a peep about Bitcoin… leaving, once again, the onus on the taxpayer to figure everything out.

First time it went up was from nerd obscurity to a reddit mention of Euro dude turning $29 into $829k.   
  
Then there was the silk road shut combined with "bubble" talk - for the drop. 
  
  
Then gesticulation, and then congress hearing - and boom - explosion of desperate speculators locked arm in arm singing we shall overcome.  
  
Now reality, along with the truth of real awareness and conflict with real power (it's not a game anymore). - for a real drop.
  
It isn't a simple matter of it goes up, it goes down, it goes up, it goes down, it goes up. 
 
The bigger it gets the bigger it's battles. 
Up next : taxes, banks, unauthorization funding, blockades.  
  
Where it is headed it can't win.

what's that gonna get? that's like 1/20th of 1 btc. even if it went to $100,000, that's only $5000

me too, but how are we going to have a legit economy, if even these early first % adopters can't even do it without getting fucked around. imagine trying to get people who live paycheck to paycheck and can't even park their car correctly between 2 lines on board
