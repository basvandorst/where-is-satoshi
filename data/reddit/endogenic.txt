Value conflates price, utility, and maybe more. If we call it price instead of value then how do things change?

Interesting point about fabricating gold, although, in the situation where it must be used rather than digital money, we might not be doing so much gold fabrication. 
I'd say the important thing about those asset classes he mentioned is that their value is expected to increase regardless of your continued input, whereas the same can't quite be said of time or a given occasion.

What about it? Do you use gold as a main store of value or only as a diversification of how you store value? Do you think it's now the best option for storing value? How hard is it to store 10MM in gold?

Everything that exists has intrinsic value.

So you're saying the relationship between gold's value and its "intrinsic value" is the reason gold was chosen? Nope. It was used as a currency because of its desirable features in application as a currency. There are many of them. That's why I argue that... does that seem to make sense?

If lightning is a layer 2 solution, what are one or two examples of layer 3 and 4 solutions?

TIL gold has a lightning network

It means you send the same (web) request to a (web) service repeatedly, and the request will work if the service doesn't verify the uniqueness of the request. The request might be obtained by a malicious third party who is sniffing traffic on your network. Sometimes this will even work if the traffic is encrypted because you would just send the same encrypted data to the server.
