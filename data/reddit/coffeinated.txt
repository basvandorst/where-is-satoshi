It just depends on the size in general, not on the transmitted value. Many inputs drive the cost up, that‘s why some people use periods like right now to consolidate all their small inputs into a bigger tx, whereas segwit drives the cost down, especially when many signatures and inputs are needed. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:04:56
Absolutely possible, it‘s not like those guys would not like to earn money, too.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:10:15
No, to route payments you have to have funds in the outgoing channel.

I can tell you, I have a some really really good friends with which I can speak about absolutely everything and that went through stuff with me that I wouldn‘t wish upon my worst enemies. But then there are also some people who are more peripheral, who are still pretty important but I don‘t write that often with them, and I believe those might suffer a bit when the option for a quick casual discussion over a long distance goes away... that‘s the way it is these days, doesn‘t make them bad friends.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:47:12
Yeah, just like you give up your dollar coins when you put them in your leather wallet... you know? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:12:24
Depends on the single node of course, but it would be quite easy to take exponentially more fees of people who initiate extremely many tx per time.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:26:13
Eh, dude, I know how that shit works, believe me. Adding hashpower to whatever end of the fee schedule only empties the mempool out faster until the difficulty gets adjusted.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:46:00
Potentionally, yeah. However, the post did not say this makes your money more secure, rather it allows you to set better fees.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:25:37
Uh, yeah no. It‘s just some consolidation tx made by bitgo which were sent out some days ago and gow through now because there‘s less tx traffic.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:55:14
Depends on the context? In the context of *lightning*, a lightning emoji is what it is. In context of nazi bullshit, might be different, but then it‘s already nazi bullshit anyways

Yeah because surprise it‘s not yours. If someone deposits money to that company and then sends you money the company now has your money, the longer the better. They don‘t want you to cash out, so better make it complicated and let it take a long time.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:23:55
Yeah, whenever you spend bitcoin, you spend transactions. You do not have 1 ₿, you have a tx that points to your address. If you would now send someone 0.1 ₿, from this address, the miner would happily take the 0.9 ₿ fee. Every tx output thats unclaimed is fee, that‘s how fees work. So, in order not to lose your money, your new tx has to have two outputs: one with 0.1, and one with (0.9 - fee). The second one should point to a new address you created, e.g. a new paper wallet. Wallet software does this automatically for you. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:59:05
Nice try to pump a shitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:15:07
They should just run a mining rig themselves and just prioritize their own transactions every time they find a block. This way they could consolidate all their dust UTXOs for „free“ 
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:54:59
Probably not. In general, you can split up huge transactions into multiple smaller ones across multiple channels, but here this seems rather unlikely. I wouldn‘t advise anyone to put 3 ₿ on mainnet lightning yet as well.
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:14:18
This is wrong, a market order costs 0.25% - which is not very much.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:39:13
You can only send a payment over a route if all hops in that direction have enough capacity in the correct direction. That being said, a payment can be split, so that sometimes with intelligent circle routing another hops‘ channel can be topped up again to allow the next payment to go through. If routing is impossible LN should provide you an error message, however of course you should try that out on the testnet for all of us ;)
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:50:32
I don‘t know and I don‘t want to speculate. All I can say is that using online wallets is intrinsically unsafe and not a good idea. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:30:33
What? If a block contains x transactions and I can have 10% more blocks per time, I can do 1.1*x transactions per time. Why are people so bad at maths?
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:24:48
Wrong. Their non-segwit txs clog up the blockchain we are all using.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:42:19
Request denied. Fees are not relative to the transaction value, so they shouldn‘t be expressed relative to each other. This would imply a correlation where there is none.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:33:26
Which would be huge by the way. If 5% of today‘s transactions would just go away, the mempool would clear significantly.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:06:13
People like to compare the blockchain to a boat, or maybe let‘s say a file cabinet. If you want to write anything on it, that costs you money, becourse this data has to be transferred around the world and permanently saved. For your money, you get a network which is pretty save, because the algorithm would require someone who wants to change the blockchain to invest huge amounts of energy that aren‘t easy to find.
However, so you pay to get you papers in the file cabinet, which is of quasi fixed size, and one is filled every ten minutes, so the space is limited. If more people want in then there‘s room, the space is auctioned, so whoever pays more gets in. Depending on the complexity of your transaction, you might need more than one sheet of paper to write it on, and every piece of paper obviously costs money. So, a tx with many inputs and many outputs costs more than a 1-1 tx, which is the cheapest. It doesn‘t matter what amount you write on the papers, but only how many sheets you need, and that‘s why every blockchain that‘s actually used is better for transferring huge amounts than tiny ones - the work that needs to be done for tiny amounts is the absolute same, there is no economical reason for fees to be relative to the amount of money. Remember, this is not a bitcoin, but a blockchain problem - bitcoin is just the chain that is the most heavily used. No blockchain in the world can compete with a centralized database while staying truly decentralized.
This is by the way where lightning comes into play - it takes transactions off chain, and the difficulty to route money is based on the amount you want to transact, that‘s why you will pay a fee relative to the moved amount in the lightning network. The process of sending transactions just scales differently.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:12:35
If the tx fee in ethereum money right now costs 50 cents, and you just instantly raise the value of ethereum in dollars, your tx in ethereum will then cost more in dollars. If ethereum at like 700$ now would trade at 14,000$ like bitcoin does, the tx fee would be twentyfold in dollars, or 50 cents would become 10$. You would send less ethereum because you can transmit more dollars with less ether but the tx fee is unaffected by the moved value, so a high coin valuation instantly raises tx fees - all other things being equal. One would expect a free market to lower the ethereum / satoshi fees, but for some reason that doesn‘t happen.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:05:17
Yeah, the fees are probably as high as they are because noone uses it. Genius.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:47:03
Except a fucking sms cost 19 cents the last time I used these things. 19 cents! 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:19:44
You don‘t understand how lightning works. The hub doesn‘t even know who the receiver or the sender of a payment is, only the last and the next hop on the route. If a party is acting badly, you can just route around them easily, so what. Stop spewing FUD, lightning will be goood.
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:51:31
That‘s all blatantly wrong.
You can put it in someone else‘s wallet who insuresbthe contents for you, no problem. With a multisig address especially.
Support it - what kind of support? Like the central banks? Yeah that‘s the whole idea.
Help you - of course, there‘s tons of help available on the internet, you can talk to the devs, etc..
Protect it - not needed, put it in a wallet, defended by itself.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:56:03
I mean, what is a bitcoin? You can only instruct the bitcoin network to make a transaction, you cannot „send bitcoin“... nothing is moved. So yeah you can send the private key via SMS or something which gives you control over some bitcoins, but... it‘s somewhat hard to define.

It is, for sure. I believe what we mean is the same and we do overall agree, I‘m just tired and my english suffers because of that. I surely did not think „yeah, 19k, that‘s because of adoption!“ - that was pure speculation and overheating. December was bananas, let‘s be honest, but of course I was happy because I made some money, or rather the value of my bitcoin investment went up. Still, that does of course not automatically make the upwards price movement more rational than the downwards one. That‘s all noise. But when you zoom out to a 3 year scale and look at monthly candles or weekly or whatever, there‘s less noise and more signal. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:45:35

That‘s bullshit, plain and simple. Bitcoin is decentralized because no central authority decides about it or controls it, same with lightning. Neither does a big hub does decide about your coins, nor do they know what you do with them.

No, they are not necessarily good for Bitcoin, but they are a sign that Bitcoin is good. A blockchain based crypto currency will always have fees if it is used, what you get in return is a guarantee that people will save your transaction for you forever and take care of your money. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:07:24
Yes, it is. It‘s one of the most difficult things in software development to be honest, because it‘s very hard to decide what information the user really needs and when, and what kind of options you want to give them. Just look at coinbase vs gdax, two completely different approaches to the same problem - buying bitcoins. Or look at Apple vs Android, Gimp vs Photoshop... blah blah.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:06:27
No? Doesn‘t matter if people trade 1000 bitcoin for 10$ or or 10 bitcoin for 1000$, the moved money stays the same, so the fees stay the same. A high bitcoin price doesn‘t necessarily correlate with a high volume.

Well, with lightning, as soon as you have opened a channel once, you can then pay this bar for nearly free - as long as it does offer lightning, if course, so they‘d have to have a channel as well. You don‘t need a channel to this specific bar, much like you don‘t have to run a cable to google.

The average joe can open a lightning channel without any problems, it‘s just not that polished yet, somewhat like email in the early days.
Ideally, a lightning node should be always online, but it doesn‘t really have to be. It‘s just a trust issue. If you have a channel open with someone who you really trust, you can go offline. I guess there will be some kind of providers, and lightning might not be the uppermost layer.

You can also create a paper wallet, which is of course way cheaper than a hardware one. Just be sure to use an offline generation process and for fucks sake when you ever take your money out of it be sure that you understand what you are doing and what a change address is.
If you have one tx with 1 ₿ to your paper wallet‘s address, your next outgoing tx HAS to send the remainder to a new address. If you just send 0.1 ₿ to someone, you pay 0.9 ₿ fee, don‘t do that. Read up on it and make sure you understand it before you decide to create a paper wallet.

Oh god, you really got burnt. I‘m sorry for you. That really was a bad fee situation back then, and the horrendous fees coinbase asks for weren‘t exactly helping.
The problem is, blockchain transaction fees are never per value, but per complexity of the transaction. So, had you moved one million dollars, your fees would have been exactly the same - and negligible. Of course they weren‘t for you, and that‘s shitty.
No blockchain will ever be able to scale, because you basically can only make blocks bigger in a linear fashion - blocks of double the size can handle double the transactions, and it‘s questionable if that actually equals to double the users.
That‘s where technologies like lightning come into play, which scale on a whole different way, and can scale per user. Whereas a blockchain gets worse with more users, lightnind and other peer 2 peer networks get *better*. And believe me, all other cryptos with blockchain either have low fees because they aren‘t actually used, bitcoin **is**, or they use blocks so stupidly big it‘s impossible to keep the coin decentralized, which is one of the core values if bitcoin - being decentralized, trustless, and under no ones control. If you want free money transfer and nothing else, you could basically just use PayPal.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:45:14
Well, if we ignore segwit and everything and each 10 minutes a block of 2000 tx is mined, then the mempool fills up when more than 2000 tx are submitted per 10 minutes, and it empties when there are less than 2000 txs submitted. 
Or, rounding a bit, if for some reason Bitcoin would have 2 MB blocks with 4000 transactions, this would mean 12,000 tx more per hour which would completely eradicate the mempool in less than a day, which would bring miner fees down to zero, would probably kill every incentive to buy more miner gear, and wouldn‘t be good for anyone. Scaling linearly is hard, and that‘s why there is never enough cashiers in a super market. Better people wait a few minutes than having 10 empty lines.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:18:21
Blockchain? You don‘t know what you‘re talking about and you are spreading FUD, that‘s it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:07:51
Cool, so we‘d have 1 MB blocks every 0.5 seconds, so scalable
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:31:48
The difficulty is adjusted so that avg block time is 10 minutes. Yeah, some are discovered faster, some slower, average is 10 minutes. If you adjust the difficulty so that the average discovery time is 9 minutes, more blocks are discovered per time, period. More blocks = more tx.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:23:49

Oh, if you didn‘t earn anything with it, there‘s no way I could accept anything from you anyhow.

Which is pretty fair. With a regular broker, paying at least 5$ per trade (here in germany at least that‘s normal), it‘s hard to even break even for the average joe on the stock markets. When you think about it, moving 1000$ in and out costs you 10$ or more, that‘s 1% already. It scales way better when you can invest 10,000 or 100,000$, which is not fair for average people.

I‘m not saying they don‘t have real value, of course they do. I‘m just saying both companies might very well be a tad overvalued. The intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies is of course way more abstract, more difficult to define and might very well be orders of magnitude smaller than the actual current valuation.

It‘s not because people *still* think the wallets would charge the fees, or you can‘t change fees to whatever you like.

You could also download a wallet app, put your phone in flight mode, create a new address, write it down, delete the app, and *then* activate the internet again. Should be kinda safe - as long as „writing it down“ is pen on paper.

I searched one minute:
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:47:35
That could be done, but the question is - would you do it? You invest millions in mining hardware to mine blocks that make you less money than possible?
That being said, some pool(s?) has a website where you can submit your tx that doesn‘t get confirmed because the fees aren‘t high enough, and the first 100 to do so will get confirmed every day.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:14:26
Do not and never use online wallets. I‘d rather use a wallet app on my phone honestly than a website, they are a total nightmare security wise.
While with a wallet app, you might not have a guarantee that the app creator does not copy your private keys to his server, that‘s already a given on an online wallet - it doesn‘t work any other way. Also the service could just close tomorrow and you would be out of your money. Nah. Oh and malware can easily fuck you over, there was a post here today where someone got his bitcoin stolen somehow with blockchain.info - he probably had malware on his computer that changed the receiving address on submitting.

Yeah, as he said, in theory everyone should be running a node. When you use a mobile wallet, the wallet creator usually runs a node for you. 
When you run a node, you know that you are on a bitcoin network. It wouldn‘t matter if the 100 people in seattle would collude and do dumb stuff, your node would not be affected and still would only accept and verify blocks as real and correct that are real and correct by its very own rules.

Being decentralized, being trustless, being under no ones control. No one can freeze your bitcoin wallet, no one can tell you what to do with your bitcoin, no one has to know they are your bitcoin. One bitcoin will forever stay one bitcoin, no one can print new ones at a higher rate than the system intends you to - currently 12.5 bitcoin per block, halved roughly every four years. The dollars / euros on your bank account are being devalued every single day to pay other people‘s debts by the central banks.
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:43:40
Yeah, sure. Some centrally controlled coin is of course just as secure, because why not, what could ever go wrong with that *except it‘s the exact same thing we already have today with fiat money*?
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:09:47
I mean, there‘s no way to know for sure, bit I‘d guess most transactions happen between exchanges, e.g. someone buys bitcoin on coinbase and sends it to another exchange to trade alts. If the exchanges would be connected with a lightning channel, and my assumption is true, that might take enough strain off the network to basically bring down the fees back into the dollar range. Now connect one exchange directly with bitpay, and any user who has a channel with his exchange can connect to any exchange and pay with bitcoin without making more than one transaction. If that isn‘t good, I don‘t know what is. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:20:12
You could simply buy on GDAX. Afaik, all exchanges work differently than coinbase, but you have to wire money to them first.

Trading on exchanges is not settled on the blockchain, no blockchain in the world could handle that. It‘s just numbers that are exchanged, only when you withdraw it‘s on the blockchain. You could have ten billion trades on an exchange without committing a single tx to the ledger.

Also, „holding“ doesn‘t even stay the same. You can hold bitcoin now and sell it the very next minute, and you can do that a few hundred times a day. You are then a bitcoin holder - but not a hodler. Hodling means not to sell even in the biggest crashes, to keep calm nerves, and rather just buy more. Hodling is the exact counterpart to day trading.

Is LN a central organization? No? Then it is not a bank. LN is only like the internet of Bitcoin. And I‘m quite excited to see who will be the big players in the LN like google, amazon and facebook are on the internet.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:27:45
Well, paypal etc charge a fee (of the merchant) because, well, they can. It‘s not like it would cost Visa more to move 100000$ for you instead of 100$, they just charge you more fee because they want a piece of the cake.
If Visa decides to close shop or just to exclude you from their party, that‘s the way it is. Doesn‘t matter if you‘re on vacation and your credit card is the only money you have right now. With bitcoin, that basically can‘t happen, because everyone would need to abandon bitcoin at once, which is a rather unlikely event. 
But to achieve this, bitcoin uses a public and decentralized database, and storage space in that database isn‘t free for a good reason. Thus, it matters how much you want to save in that database (that is, how complicated your transaction is), not how much you actually transfer. A copyshop also charges you for the amount of pages you print, not the size of the text on it.
With lightning, the game changes - nodes typically charge fees relative to the moved amount, because they have to provide the capacity to move this amount of bitcoin, but don‘t have to store the transaction forever.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:38:06
Yeah, for example. Or you could just install a testnet wallet, play around with it, discover bugs, and create issues on GitHub, etc. I personally believe the driver for LN to strike will be merchant adoption. So, if anyone out there has an e-shop and is willing to integrate Lightning as a payment option, that would be huge - especially if they‘d be willing to keep outgoing channels funded. And we need at least one exchange that supports it, so we can go lightning full circle. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:21:21
I‘m not dodging questions, I‘m saying the current correction is what it is, a correction. The overall chart still looks like adoption. Adoption isn‘t something that drives prices on a daily or weekly basis, but rather a monthly timescale, so I think it‘s wrong to attribute such a tiny correction to less adoption. Adoption also will not tell you why the price jumped to 19k, but it explains why the price has now 4-5 digits instead of 3. So, in conclusion, you did not really ask a proper question, because on a larger scale of things, the price did not really go down, it just corrected a bit and is still in the area where it roughly belongs.

This is insanely wrong. The amount of transactions is not linearly connected to the energy usage. In theory, we could scale up blocks 100x, compute 100x as many txs and have the very same energy usage. The only problem would be that someone would have to save those big ass blocks somewhere.
By the way, printing good old fiat money needs more energy than the bitcoin network, and mining gold needs a fuckton more energy than bitcoin. Calm down.

This guy is correct, stop downvoting him. With segwit, the witness is moved to the end, and can be discarded, which legacy nodes will still accept. That‘s why it‘s backwards compatible. Legacy nodes will see everything up until the witness, which is still limited to 1MB, and are happy. Newer nodes compute the size differently, keep the witness, and are still happy.

That of course happens in wave. Right now we are seeing that the 10k level forms a support, off which we can bounce back up later.

@_date: 2018-01-07 18:12:40
Just like every other coin with bigger blocks will have. Scaling on a blockchain is not possible, period, as long as we all agree that we do not want blocks of infinite size.
The high fees are not a bitcoin problem, they are a blockchain problem, and all solutions put strains on everyone who wants to keep a copy of the blockchain. If you make a transaction, you ask the system to keep and broadcast a copy of your transaction, and that has to cost some money - obviously. While the high fees surely are a negative experience, they also mean one thing: what everyone always wanted is happening, *Bitcoin is being used*, and *people are willing to pay high fees to do so*. That is something, isn‘t it? This means we have a strong foundation to put further work on, and bitcoin has a reason to exist. All those naysayers that say bitcoin is a bubble are *wrong*. The fees are a symptom of bitcoins *success*.

You are the dumb one. Op said that if you put 1 bitcoin in your wallet today which is worth 10$, and tomorrow it‘s worth 10000$, you won‘t have to refund the channel as quickly because the dollar value of the channel went up without putting more bitcoin in it.

It just happens that people say „yeah maybe I can‘t buy shit with one dollar tomorrow, better give me two dollars for my bread“ and very soon it‘s 10 dollars and then a hundred and then you don‘t know where to put all those zeroes on the bill. It just happens in bad economic situations, and there is literally **no** intrinsic value in any money. It‘s only trust and a somewhat limited supply, and as soon as your government prints money to pay off its debt you as a regular citizen are getting fucked over. Period.

Address starts with 1: regular old legacy address
Address starts with 3: regular address format with segwit built in, currently a very good option because you get nearly all segwit benefits while being **fully backwards compatible**
Address starts with bc1: you have gone full segwit, however, not all wallets will be able to send to this address because it might not yet be built in as this is a new format and is not backwards compatible.

Source? From what I‘ve heard, it would rather be 1.8-2.8 MB, which is yuuuge. This would clear the mempool in 10 hours. Even 1.3 MB would probably clear it in a few days, so what. The thing about the mempool is, it‘s clogged, yeah, but not... out of hand style clogged. We are just barely running over capacity, and even a small increase in throughput would clear up everything again - given this would not increase the usage, of course. Which it probably would. Anyhow, I‘ve never heard of 1.3 MB with segwit.

Some wallets are double shitty, that is no segwit and more expensive by default, and then their fee calculation algorithm produced fees that are way over the top even for non segwit. This introduces unnecessary competition into the fee market, because when some people pay these fees, I have to compete with them. And that‘s a pretty shitty situation.
Also, don‘t trust web wallets. If someone else has your private keys, he can steal your bitcoin right now.

No. A certain number of txs come in, a certain number of tx fit into a block, blocks get mined every ten minutes, that‘s it. End of the story. The amount of tx that fit into a block is not determined by their attached fee. You can‘t fit more people in a train if you select those who paid less for a ticket, and if the number of trains per day stays the same, you don‘t transport more people. You earn just less.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:27:57
Yeah, everyone wants the million dollar bitcoin, nobody wants 1 cent satoshis for fees. Weird. But, by the way, regular market laws don‘t explain why everyone pays these high fees. I believe someone is spamming the network or something, it just doesn‘t make sense. Or some fee calculation algorithm somewhere is insanely wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:16:32
Look at it differently - when your landlord has LN, and you have LN, you can open up one monthly channel with *someone*, pay your rent over it, and everything else, at the cost of 1 tx. Your landlord can open up a channel with someone, collect all his rent through this channel, and close it again - provided his channel counter party has enough capacity, but he will be able to find someone for this. Or he could not close the channel and buy stuff with it directly instead. It will be so, so good.

So, wether the difference between text messages and free messengers would be game changing can be disputed, but let‘s take it to the extreme - do you not think that someone who‘s on free messengers all day, chatting with friends, has also more deeper conversations than someone who is only able to communicate with letters? Some of my deepest conversations were happening on whatsapp for sure and could compete somewhat with real life talk, because you have more time to think about your answer etc and can talk about other aspects than irl. If I had to do all that with paid text messages, I‘d live under a bridge.

@_date: 2018-01-15 20:25:00


Yeah, reuters at it again
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:45:00
Somewhat correct, yeah. Say you open a channel with 0.1 bitcoin, then you can send as many tx as you like for free until the 0.1 bitcoin are used up. If you receive a tx, the channel is topped up again, or if you have another channel, you can balance between them by sending payments between both channels. 
Now imagine coinbase would have lightning, too - then you could buy bitcoin on coinbase and have it sent to your channel. In that event, you would not need to open a new channel, because you basically receive a payment.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:19:48
Coinbase sucks, you can read that everywhere. Yes, using the bitcoin network of course costs money, but coinbase overcharges by a huge margin. You could have registered for GDAX with them and have sent it for free, but well, now it happened. The fee for buying is less there as well.
Look at it this way - you did buy the bitcoin to learn, which you did, and you only lost 14€, 4€ to Coinbase, 10€ to the bitcoin network. If you could have set the fees yourself, the transaction probably would have been cheaper than 4€.
However, the funny thing about Bitcoin is that even transaction 100000€ would have only cost you 10€ - or less. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:07:47
What, you are mixing up words like a kitchenaid. A wallet is not a blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:25:54
In many cases, it should be possible to route the payment back through the network into another channel of yours which you can then close. But yeah, what you see here is not what lightning will look like in the end - most merchants won‘t have a channel open with every customer of course, but maybe with hubs that have many big channels opened. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:21:37

Sure, if it becomes a world wide currency, people will have to hold a part of it, and for that it has value. If the value is only 2000$, the bitcoin network can only hold 42 billion dollars, which is not that much on a world economic scale.

The internet does not need to know about your address. An address is a number, nothing else, and a private key is a number. With your private key belonging to this address, you can create another number which can be proven to be related to both your private key and the public address.
Let‘s do a really dumb and non-working example:
Think about integer numbers, that is 1, 2, 3, 4... blahblah. This is our set of private keys.
Now, to create an address, you take your chosen private key. We choose 7 as our private key, the square is 49, this is your public address. These numbers belong together in our system, they follow the given rules, there is nothing the internet needs to know about.
Now I could tell the public system „I want to send money from 49 to 225, the codeword is 14“. In this shitty example, we‘d calculate (14/2)^2 and get 49, and be happy. The issue is of course that everyone knows your private key just by looking at the numbers, and that‘s bullshit. But the system can verify that to get to the codeword 14, you had to have the number 7.
In Bitcoin, much more complex voodoo math is used, using prime numbers and remainder calculations, which cannot be reversed, but we can still proof that someone had the correct private key by looking at the public key (49) and the signature (14) he gave us, without being able or needing to calculate the private key. The principle stays the same. Your private key and the public address are connected by maths, and you create the address by creating a random private key which is just a big ass number, and generating the public address by a certain set of mathematical rules from it. The address is just another number and simply valid because it is a number, just like 261 is a valid house number.

Could people just fuck the shut up already if the price was *anything* about transaction fees fucking bitcoin cash would be at 100k$.

Of course the fees are lower because no one uses Bcash. An average Bitcoin block contains 2-3000 Tx, an average Bcash block 2-500. Bcash blocks are completely empty and bitcoin itself would not have a fee problem if the amount of transactions would be as low as this.

@_date: 2017-12-20 07:15:57
That‘s true. They‘d be able to keep up longer but their current low fees are not because of their blocksize. Also, if enough people would be in BCH to fill up 8MB blocks it might very well be that the feed would then explode even worse, because the competition would be even higher. Who knows? I know for sure that 8MB is not nearly enough when this crypto thing really runs on full steam and what do they want to do next? 1GB blocks? Bullshit. Scaling onchain is impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:52:54
Thing is, Lightning does not give two fucks about geo location. You could run a lightning node in namibia or on the bahamas. Good luck regulating that. If government wants to regulate a hub it will fail to comply, because it knows _nothing_ about its customers, and hubs in unregulated areas will survive.

People do fear that someone or a group of people now bought insane amounts of bitcoin. This would allow to them to buy short contracts and then trigger a panic sell by selling all these bitcoins again. However, I am not entirely sure this is true, because:
* the money needed to drive up the price as much as we‘ve seen here isn‘t exactly change.
* asian exchanges are leading in price, not the americans.
* If someone can dump a billion dollars in bitcoin to drive the price up artificially, would he care about bitcoin?
That being said, I will still put up some stop loss orders before futures start.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:13:53
Yeah, what if? It‘s still only a bitcoin address. If banks want to earn some money by providing LN hubs, good for them. The system itself is still trustless. Anyone can do it, so can banks. The issue with banks now is they can do stuff I cannot.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:37:31
Segwit is a softfork, you can just use it and it‘s backwards compatible. So any however old wallet can send to and receive from segwit addresses. The point is most people do still not use segwit, for example because their funds are in wallets that don‘t use segwit. Segwit is pretty neat because it reduces the space a transaction needs, so everything gets more efficient. S2X basically only hopped onto the segwit name and wanted to introduce 2MB blocks, but it had only one dev and basically noone cared.

@_date: 2017-12-20 06:01:06
Bcash is cheaper because bcash blocks are empty. Average tx count per bitcoin block is 2-3000, average on bcash is 2-500. on these levels bitcoin txs would cost the same. Great.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:22:56
They are somewhat like counter forces. Think about it like this, you want to make apple pie for your whole street, so you go to the market because you need like 200 pounds of apples. You will probably find 100 pounds for 1$, and then people will say yeah I can get you more apples but I want 1.20$. So, some merchants made a limit order (sell apple for 1$) and some made another (sell apple for 1.20$). As soon as all cheap apples are bought, the price goes up, and the customer makes the market order („just get me 200 pounds of apples“).
In an exchange, there is another side, because you can actually post limit buy orders. That‘s like  you sitting on the market with a sign „would buy apples for 0.99$/pound“. Someone else might be willing to give 80 cents only. Soon merchants will think about standing there all day and trying to sell apples or just giving them to you. This would basically drive the price down to 0.99$, though a regular customer would still have to pay 1$ (read about Bid/ask price). As soon as your buy order is fulfilled, you go home, and merchants can give their apples to the 80 cents guy - or maybe they won‘t. Probably they will before someone else does.
So, limit order = sign with „would pay / buy for xx moneys“, market order = „I need 20 apples“, and market orders eat limit orders. The current price / the last trade price is just the last trading decision someone made. Could be buying apples, could be selling apples. Obviously, if many people want apples, you will have a hard time to get any with your 80 cents sign and you will soon increase the price if you really want any apples. If you think apples are too expensive now, you won‘t. Some people then start apple farms and try to throw shitty apples on the market which are called „apple cash“, and no one cares because everyone knows it‘s not real fruit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:49
Yeah, we should like put all our bitcoins into a centralized wallet and when we want to pay something that centralized wallet would just tell the merchant "here, your account is now worth 5 mBTC more" and he is happy. We need a name for these centralized wallets though... mh. Let's call them "banks".
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:20
Saw the same :/ But I think we should not take this too seriously - it's not released yet and especially the fees will just be driven by demand and supply. Channel providers will compete with the fees, because you will automatically select the cheapest channel, whereas with regular Blockchain transactions, you compete with other txs, because miners automatically select the txs with the highest fees.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:26:37
That post doesn‘t add anything. Decentralized doesn‘t even equal „not everyone has access“. It doesn‘t matter if the internet is routed through one or thousand hubs if not everyone has access.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:57:17
Uh... no? More hashpower does not equal more transactions. If a block is full, it‘s full, and people will pay more to get in as quickly as possible. It‘s purely demand and offer, and offer only goes up when more people use segwit. OR when miners would switch on more hardware when a lot of txs are waiting to get the fees, but that‘s not really how it works because of the difficulty adjustment.

Which is bullshit. Doubling the blocksize is not „scaling“. It does not make bitcoin scale well. Scaling means being able to handle somewhat arbitrarily large request / transaction numbers. If you have a website on one heavily overloaded server and put a second one to its site, how‘s that scaling? As soon as your traffic triples you are in shit again.

Basically the only thing you need to know is the average size of incoming transitions, maybe per day or per week, depending on what should be the maximum waiting time. I would probably go for a day. Then you divide this by 144 and you know how big each block would have to be.

There are of course multiple possible ways to define the actual „size“ of a language. Whereas you used the size of a dictionary, I‘d say that‘s a bit optimistic. I mean, it contains nearly every single word, most of them aren‘t going to be useful or usable in most situations, and your quote itself uses the word „compendious“ to describe it. Instead, I‘d propose to use the number of actually spoken words for an estimate. For example, the Oxford dictionary’s word of the day is [widdershins]( Ever heard that one? Granted, it’s scottish - but still english and contained in the Oxford dictionary. Funnily enough, it‘s derived from my native language, german, and the original word is still in use here, however with an ever so slightly different meaning.
For example, [this article](https:/ cites a study that says most native speakers know 20,000 to 30,000 words, which puts the 32k words used by Shakespeare into perspective, especially because at those times education across the population was probably worse than today, so the average adult might have only known 15k to 25k words. I‘m not accounting for new technical words here because I‘d guess there‘s also a ton of words we‘ve already forgot again, relating to old and forgotten arts and crafts.

It gets the bitcoin ticker price from the coinbase pro api as a json, extracts it and displays it. To me it was kinda cool to do that but it‘s obviously rather useless. 
[This is what it looks like from the shortcuts app](
When activated from the shortcuts widget, it displays the price inline without a window, way nicer, but I was too lazy to remove my calendar widget because reddit doesn‘t need to see that.

There *is* an obvious reason, because the „priced in“ argument says that people buy before the halvening in speculation of a price increase which they will not do after the halvening. In an ideal market this would exactly cancel out.

That is completely unrelated to what I said. I just said not that many people bought **at** 19200, because we weren‘t up there for a long time. Of course thousands of people bought between 10k and 19k, but not right over 19k.

Some people start with it, others follow, then it happens. Maybe at first there‘s some people selling art for bitcoins, just for the fun of it, then it‘s a car, then whatever. Of course this doesn‘t happen overnight, maybe it doesn‘t happen at all. Maybe it happens in like 10 years or something, who knows. Or maybe some dudes in africa see that bitcoin might help them doing online retail, as soon as they‘ve an exchange going that might work.

It‘s not. If there are 21 million coins (there are not) and 21 million people want to put 1000$ in each (there are more of them) the price has to be 1000$. It‘s as simple as that. If more people want to put more money into it, which is likely, the price has to be higher.
21 million people is not a whole lot, 1000$ isn‘t a lot either.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:35:42

Yeah, because ETH made it simple to launch other coins on its blockchain, including cats. Why would I want that? ETH is not capped, it‘s not properly decentralized, nothing. If Vitalik dies tomorrow you will be holding the bag, that‘s it. The ETH blockchain is nearly 700 GB, tell me how this is sustainable.

The tether scandal isn‘t even real. Really, there‘s literally nothing to look at. If Tether printed USDT, bought bitcoin for USDT and sold it off for real dollars... that would really suck for those people that sold bitcoin for USDT, but there is no „fake money“ left in the bitcoin market. 
If Tether was the actual reason for this crash, the tether price would be 10 cents, but it isn‘t.
The audit stuff is fishy, yes, and it looks weird, but most things that look weird are nothing. That‘s how conspiracy theories work, humans always look for patterns, and when they find one, they can‘t unsee it. That‘s why there are elves in the forest and trolls in the mountains, because I know what I‘ve seen at night.

What? Stocks are zero sum, except dividends. You can sell stocks or you can buy stocks, that‘s about it. The price doesn‘t go up because the company is going so well, but because people think so and are willing to buy it for a higher price.
So, let‘s say our stock has a price of 95$. I‘m buying it now, so my money is now in the hands of the seller. The stock price goes to 100$, I‘m selling, so someone else‘s money is now in my hands. At this point, his wealth doesn‘t change, but I got 5$ richer already. Now the stock goes down to 95$. There were no 5$ lost somewhere or evaporated, I own the 5$ now. Money doesn‘t evaporate, it‘s already gone when you buy the stock. And your demise will be the seller‘s luck, or the other way round.

You can‘t really hold tulips. And when the price increased, they just grew more tulips, that‘s why comparing bitcoin to tulips is insanely stupid.

What is it?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:37:36
Tx time and tx fee do not depend on the value. The tx time depends on the fee when blocks are full because the space in the blocks is basically sold to the highest bidder. You can put your baggage on the train if you paid enough for your ticket, doesn‘t matter what‘s inside your bags.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:49:42
Yeah, this. HODLing is just accepting you can‘t time the market and selling now is a decision as well. When you buy, you should be sure that the market goes up afterwards. People forget that it should also go down after you sell if you plan to return to the market.

Which is true. You can‘t build cars when you have to plow your farm‘s field by hand. Sure, when automation comes in too quickly, the effects for the current generation can be quite bad, see poverty in cities across europe in the industrialization. Today, we are better off.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:59:39
I think it went from 1200 to 200. Wasn‘t that because of MtGox? I don‘t know actually. But right now there is no real reason for a crash, so I‘m confident we‘ll not drop to 1200$ again. Still, who knows... I only know that when I sell, it goes up.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:26:32
It‘s not lost, it‘s just in other people‘s hands now ;)

If Bitcoin would be the main currency, that would be quite impossible because then you could only store 2.1 billion dollars in bitcoin, which is not enough to sustain any economic activities.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:51:49
No. You are parted from your money as soon as you buy, for 95$. This event is independent of what happens in the future, your money is gone. You have however a stock in your books which has a *value* of 95$. This value exists, as you said, because someone would buy it from you again for 95$. However, the sum of the money in the system stayed the same: your 95$ are now in the hands of your seller. Another person has 75$, but doesn‘t participate yet. The system contains 170$.
If the stocks plummet tomorrow to 75$, your seller got pretty lucky, he sold before his stock lost value. You got unlucky, you gave away your 95$ for something that lost value. Person C comes and buys your stock for 75$. The system still contains 170$ via those steps:
A has a stock
B (you) have 95$
C has 75$
A has 95$
B has the stock
C has 75$
A has 95$
B has 75$
C has a stock
If you put some stocks, dollar bills and people in a vivarium, they can trade the stock all day long and its value can go up and down, but there‘s no money entering or leaving the system. In the real world, people can obviously put more money into stocks or take some out, but that doesn‘t change the basic behavior.
If the company gives you 10$ for owning the stock, a customer paid more for the product than would have been necessary.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:47:56

Yeah, as I said, current mcDonalds workers will not become robot operators. That‘s true. In the next generation, nobody will become an McDonalds worker, much like nearly nobody today is a farm worker (compared to 200 years before). People will need to educate themselves more than now to be able to keep up with the world, yes. That‘s why keeping the educational system always as good as possible is important, because there is no progress to be made when everyone is a worker for McDonalds. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:08:16
What, how should everyone be supposed to be able to win? - if you take dividends out, which do not play any role in short time corrections like this one. It‘s a piece of paper you can sell or buy, exactly like Bitcoin. The only difference are dividends. Oh, and the company can of course emit new stocks or buy some back.
The price of your stocks doesn‘t go up magically or because of good economy, but because someone bought them for that price. If you sell for more than you bought for and the stock market gets rekt tomorrow, bad for your buyer.

If everyone does this and at the current speed of decline, I really don‘t know where the bottom might be. I‘m kinda scared short term. If it doesn‘t stop at 6k, there‘s no reason for it to stop at 5k or 4k... Sure, 1k might look cheap and next thing you know it hits 500$. I hope not.

If you sell something and give the buyer an address you used before, he can see all the transactions that happened with this address - it‘s a public ledger, after all. If you give him a brand new address, there is no way for him to tell which other addresses belong to you.
