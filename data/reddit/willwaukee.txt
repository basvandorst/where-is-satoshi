Do you know the private key? If you're storing your coins with Coinbase, the answer is "NO." If you don't know your private key, the coins are not truly yours. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:07:42
Don't store funds in Coinbase. It's actually worse than storing money in a bank. They interrogate your activity, block payments, freeze and seize and shut down accounts. The whole point of Bitcoin is to be the ONLY one in control of your wealth. Use a mobile app like Airbitz for day-to-day use and a cold storage device, such as KeepKey or Trezor or Ledger, for large amounts like savings.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:25:50
Airbitz got the highest rating for privacy and security among Android wallets in [this report]( last spring. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:11:13
They could have designed a business model that didn't spy on their users and still provided all the same services, but alas...
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:10:56
Super excited about the potential of Yours. Great team too. Ryan, hit us up when you can come up for air :D 
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:47:21
The invoices created by the Airbitz app are really nice and can be sent easily via SMS and email. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:13:48
This is one of the reasons we were so thrilled that he reached out and expressed interest in visiting us. We are looking forward to discussing these important issues with him.

Try Airbitz. Also has one-touch 2FA feature. Great app.
@_date: 2016-08-30 15:30:43
Airbitz is what you want
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:43:52
So disappointed that this question must even be asked.
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:06:41
LibertyX is pretty awesome. You should totally be able to find a location near you. All you need is a smart phone and cash :)
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:30:41
Sure sounds like it.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:49:27
You're not thinking outside the box, my friend. There are today a number of non-custodial services for Bitcoin that work together to provide the exact same services as Coinbase without controlling the user's funds. One of these is Airbitz &gt; Glidera.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:04:49
Yeah, most user-friendly for the crypto-uninitiated, and it has more features than the others do to protect users against themselves.
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:58:29
Same here. I feel comfortable even against key loggers and screen grabbers thanks to the one-touch 2FA feature as well. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:58:45
Yeah, stop downvoting good ideas, r/Bitcoin. What gives?
@_date: 2016-08-01 18:45:28
The CEO of Coinbase agrees. They are not a wallet: 
@_date: 2016-08-01 01:29:45
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:58:20
We just had a lengthy discussion in the office about using consumer wallets with Lightning network to completely replace exchange custodianship. This IS a good idea, and a direction to pursue. Only risk would come when actively trading.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:40:13
Yeah, those are great for large sums, but for the millions of people carrying private keys on their mobile device, that doesn't help. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:02:57
If Coinbase has them, they're not "your" bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:06:58
This is a cool idea. If we have time, I'll be sure to do something like this. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:46:39
Move your funds to a wallet where you hold the private keys, like [Airbitz]( If you live in a supported state, you can even buy bitcoin right inside the app using the Glidera Exchange. The bitcoins are delivered directly to a Bitcoin address for which ONLY YOU control the keys. Coinbase is basically a bank, which defeats one of the main purposes of Bitcoin: to have complete control over your own wealth. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:53:44
As long as you do not forget your username and password (use a strong pw!) AND lock your device with "one-touch 2FA" in the app settings, you're golden.
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:10:16
Even the CEO of Coinbase says they are NOT a wallet. See here: 
They're just a Bitcoin retailer that proactively spies on you for law enforcement. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:09:44
Nice! I should add, even if a hacker got malware on my phone like a screengrabber or keylogger, they wouldn't be able to access my Airbitz account and steal from me because the one-touch 2FA feature won't allow the hacker to log in to my account from any other device but mine. No other mobile wallets can do that. They all show the 12 word seed on screen and ask the user to "write it down" much to screengrabbers delight.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:36:36
Thanks, Jerry ;) 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:02:15
Y U NO Mention Airbitz?
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:13:17
Each of the wallets you recommend cannot prevent a hacker using malware like a keylogger or screengrabber from stealing user funds. That's because each of your recommendations display the 12 word seed on screen and ask the user to write it down or type it back into the device to verify. Can you name the one wallet that protects the user against this? 
@_date: 2016-04-16 21:09:59
Coinbase is not a wallet. Their own [CEO said so]( Instead, use [Airbitz](
@_date: 2016-04-20 20:00:10

Hahaha, I love these Starbucks-hater comments. It's true, there are so many better coffees out there, but there's also no denying the incredible use case for bitcoin this new feature presents for the as-yet uninitiated masses. And, IMO and experience, Airbitz is the best mobile app for introducing newbies to bitcoin. Overall, a big win for adoption. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 05:24:38
Download Airbitz to your Android or iOS smartphone. Tap the menu button. Tap Buy/Sell Bitcoin. Zero fees right now.

Thanks for trying Airbitz! We've got some really great things in store for mobile fintech users coming very soon. Have you tried out the non-custodial buy/sell function inside the app (if you're in a supported US state or Canada)? There are 0% fees for a limited time :)
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:00:43
T-Mobile allows customers to use their handsets over wifi from anywhere in the world for free (or the cost of the wifi connection). No insane long distance fees. That's huge. Dish is beginning to allow for a la carte channel selection for your subscription. That's huge, especially for cable cutters who only want sports channels or movie channels or something similar. Bitcoin makes sense.

In my experience, Fold support is super responsive. Especially with cases such as yours. Just reach out to directly. He's been commenting in this thread :)
@_date: 2015-12-18 19:52:52
you should try using Glidera inside of the Airbitz wallet to buy. No custody of your funds and just as easy as Circle and Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-12-14 16:44:50
So seamless. Four taps and done. Just tried it and was able to buy the card and pay in the amount of time it took me to order two coffees. Increds. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:42:31
It's not the most popular, but it's not obscure or super tiny.

Everyone who pays full price for Starbucks coffee is effectively financing this large discount that comes from partially spent and relatively illiquid pools of gift cards. Fold is exploiting a market inefficiency to deliver sweet discounts and a fun use case to the bitcoin community.

Yeah, Coinbase problem. Change the word "coinbase" to "local meetup" and this story is over in 8 days, assuming weekly meetup. 
...Every bitcoin meetup should be weekly, same time/same place, btw. Do it for at least 3 months. Best way to capture tons of noobs in your hood and scale BTC merchants way faster, too. Hypothetically, your mom would have way more fun going out IRL and experiencing this awesome community than from some sketchy, time-intensive website like Coinbase. :)

A uni-directional machine is de-facto a vending machine. I've seen a consensus in this community regarding this: bi-directional = ATM, Uni = bitcoin vending machine

I hold bitcoin meetups weekly in Milwaukee at a bar/night club.  All the bartenders love getting tipped in BTC and they have zero trouble working with the BitPay POS on their tablet to accept payments for bar tabs.  Other patrons not participating in the meetup are always fascinated and strike up conversations.  A few months ago these gawkers hadn't heard about bitcoin when they ask "what is that/what are you doing?" when meetup members pay their tabs.  Now the gawkers ask "what's that?" and when they hear bitcoin, their ears perk up, they've heard of it, and they have a relatively positive opinion about it.  I make them download a wallet right then and there and send them some satoshis.  They're hooked.  
A lot of work needs to be done to build out the UI's and other infrastructure, but IMO bitcoin is already fun and easy enough for the average urban crowd.  
@_date: 2014-06-05 05:37:44

This can be used as evidence to show haters that BTC is not anon and doesn't inherently harbor "evil criminals." The powers that shouldn't be will use it to claim a victory, and we can let them have their "victory." This proves block chain-centric laws aren't necessary for LEOs to do their jobs. How long does it take the Feds to bust a major cartel in real life? Years? Forever? ...Well, with BTC and the darknet, it takes less than a year. Now, hands off while we innovate.

Prosecutors would nail him for wanting to suppress that evidence, by trying to trap him into implying he owned the servers despite the claim of privacy interest. You never want the defendant on the stand, but sometimes that's a needed last resort that can result in gaining favor from the jury and lead to an acquittal. But you never want to be in a scenario where the prosecution is goading the defense to put the defendant on the stand because they know there's such a vulnerability. Dratel knows this, I'm sure, and tried to get enough weight behind his motion without the personal privacy interest piece. Didn't work. Judges are often the prosecutors' best friends, which obviously isn't right...but, clearly so in this case.

neither. all satoshis are in the cloud and private keys are essentially random numbers. can you own a number? I think not. All you can do is act as custodian. Since the numbers are huginormously massively hugebig, if you can effectively "hide" or keep secret your unique massive random numbers, then you can feel good about securing value in this magnificent paradigm shifting digital good.

DPR issued the hits. It's common knowledge there were multiple DPRs. Especially, in the time period when any "hits" were being discussed. In fact, the ability of trusted admins (including undercover and criminally motivated gov't agents) to reset user passwords means that they could have assumed the ID of DPR at any given time. It's known that DPR passed his ID on to other people willfully, but it also appears the DPR moniker and assets were assumed without the 'official' DPR's knowledge. Reasonable doubt just oozes around the accusation that Ulbricht was _the_ DPR who ordered the hits, crimes for which he is not charged.

I earn 95% of my income in BTC. Have since January. It certainly makes things more interesting, but it's been entirely possible. Old landlord used to accept BTC from me. Working on the new landlord. Groceries and gas have been no problem, but utilities are another story. I try my best to avoid selling to coinbase or circle as the price has declined. I much prefer to sell at a loss to friends, family, or to newbies on localbitcoins and at meetups. That's one way to spread adoption. All in all, it feels amazing, even with the decline in price. There's a roof over our heads, food on the table, and scores upon scores of great new friends from my full immersion into bitcoin. 
It's the most animating contest I've experienced in my life.

Airbitz is great and full of functionality for everyday things. On top of the high security, privacy, and remarkable ease-of-use, you'll find Airbitz has the following goodies: Merchant directory to find local businesses accepting bitcoin, Bitcoin ATM listings, you can buy/sell BTC inside the app in over 20 countries and many US states, buy discounted gift cards for Starbucks (&lt;20% off) or Target (&lt;10% off), and even do invoicing, accounting, and it even has a merchant mode for bitcoin accepting business. You'll be quite satisfied. Go to airbitz.co/app in your mobile browser.

Glidera ID verification can be a huge pain. It's not always, but I often hear people getting stuck at this point and waiting for the manual review. I am hearing that the recent acquisition by Kraken will make the onboarding process a LOT faster.

Airbitz is a secure and fully private mobile wallet for Bitcoin. In it, there are some plugins. One is Glidera (recently acquired by Kraken, hence the recent expansion from 21 to 49 states as of like two weeks ago). When you tap on "Buy Bitcoin" inside Airbitz, then tap on Glidera, you can add your banking information to Glidera and once you get approved you can buy and sell bitcoin just like Coinbase and Circle, except the BTC always goes directly to a wallet ONLY YOU control instead of being in the custody of those other guys. Hope that helps. Let us know if you have any other questions support

You can now buy and sell Bitcoin right from your bank account in 49 US states using Airbitz -&gt; Glidera. Download Airbitz on your phone and use the Glidera plugin to buy and sell :)

@_date: 2016-12-14 18:35:48
Use Airbitz. It automatically saves transaction meta data (privately, client-side) like the exchange rate at the time of transaction, etc. Then you just export a quickbooks or excel spreadsheet of the account history and hand it over to your accountant. Your accountant will just create a new tender category (like you would for accepting gift cards, for example) and add the BTC income to the company books. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:03:16
Download Airbitz and use the Glidera plugin. Now available in 49 states (sorry New York). Cheaper than Coinbase and non-custodial unlike all the other retail brokerages. You'll be glad you did. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:55:06
Download Airbitz and find the Glidera plugin. Use that to buy Bitcoin with your bank account in 49 states.
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:16:55
Download Airbitz on your phone, and as long as you don't live in New York State, you can link your bank account through the Glidera plugin and buy Bitcoins directly to a wallet whose keys ONLY you control.
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:25:42

If you lose your phone, you can recover your coins as long as you know your username/pw/pin. Just grab a new device and login. 
You can't recover BTC using a transaction ID, but as long as you know your username and password with Airbitz you're good. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:11:37

Airbitz is the most full-featured and easy to use mobile bitcoin wallet, and I've tried them all. On top of that, the team cares deeply about privacy and have pushed the discussion in meaningful ways. Their "one-touch" 2FA implementation is also stroke of genius. I feel super confident being 100% in control of my keys, no matter what happens to Airbitz or my devices. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:53:53
I know they were definitely accepting BTC last year, but often if people don't come in and pay somewhat regularly the business will lose interest. Also, many employees are not trained to know the BTC payment option even exists, so it is wise to go see the business yourself and support them. Merchant services for credit cards are known to visit merchants and check on them. They expect to see someone to "support" them with BTC payments integrations, and so they're basically waiting for a visit from the bitcoin community to help them. I suggest reaching out again, even in person, to check in and let them know you're thinking of bringing a big group!
@_date: 2015-07-05 13:08:44

Satoshi may not be "dead" but his private keys sure are.
@_date: 2015-07-19 23:09:16
How about backed by Time? Timestamped proofs of work and immutable history. The older an event (transaction) took place, the more unalterable or true it becomes. This is like the opposite of what humans are used to where the longer ago something happened in history, the more manipulable or easily obfuscated it becomes. Pretty powerful way to think about it, I think. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:53:26

You have not undertaken thorough consideration of your claims. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:23:29
I agree with your reduction in supply argument, but the short term damage - I venture - would make the long term potential inconsequential. The world would never understand, and Bitcoin's dominance quotient would be decimated. Which is exactly why the keys were destroyed in secret, probably as soon as SN got Gavin's email about the CIA (limited?) hangout.

As with any bitcoin-to-digital-fiat/digital-fiat-to-bitcoin trade, the user must comply with the AML/KYC requirements of the service provider on the fiat side. Airbitz's zero-knowledge Edge Security is used to secure everything inside the app. However, in order to trade bitcoin using Glidera or Clevercoin, the user must share their banking information with those services, of course. Your Airbitz app authenticates with these services using BitID and the bitcoin keys in your wallet, so as long as one-touch 2FA is turned on inside your Airbitz app, your Glidera and Clevercoin accounts are arguably more secure than your average online bank account. Bottom line, trading bitcoin with Glidera and Clevercoin - whether using Airbitz or any other means - is not anonymous.  
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:45:29
Try Airbitz.
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:45:37
Yes, I do. I think it's nice that someone posted this story, and also that we are continuing to grow and expand our service offerings, which make Bitcoin more fun and easy to use in more and more parts of the world :)

It's a really incredible design. We do not reset passwords, but have developed a recovery mechanism where we do not need to know any personal account details. We are in the process of dramatically improving our zero-knowledge password recovery feature to simplify and strengthen it even further. 
Airbitz is creating a number of tiny "inventions" to make autonomous privacy and security usable by the masses. Another one of these is "one-touch two-factor authentication," no copy/pasting OTPs, no switching apps. It just happens in the background. Set it and forget it. Haha.
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:41:58
If you do buy BTC on Coinbase, definitely DO NOT send from your Coinbase wallet to a gaming or gambling site. Basically, just be very careful about where you send funds to/from Coinbase. Just send to a personal BTC wallet you control first.

Just as any service where 2FA is enabled, if you are making major changes to your 2FA'd accounts it's imperative to disable 2FA before you delete, change, reinstall, etc., and then (of course) re-enable it once you've completed your action.
Losing your 2FA token is just as serious as losing/forgetting your password. The whole point is to keep the bad guys out, and bad guys have a much harder time getting ahold of the magic two-factor token than they do your passwords (which can be guessed/cracked with relative ease). From a security point of view, there is no way for the app to tell the difference between you and somebody trying to guess your password. 
Airbitz's "one-touch 2FA" is stored in the phone and works in the background, so uninstalling the app obviously wipes it out (as it should). While it's unfortunate that you've lost your token, the one-week wait (annoying, to be sure), is your friend in this case! 
If Airbitz didn't have this recovery mechanism, there would be *no* way to get back into your account. Other services that have two-factor enabled, such as Coinbase for example, do not have a social-engineering-proof method for letting you back into your account. Their recovery methods are either open to social engineering attacks, or there is *no* recovery method. You're locked out of your data (in this case money!) forever! 
Airbitz at least provides a recovery mechanism immune to social engineering (since there is nobody to talk to who might be tricked into resetting your two-factor), even if it's slow and annoying. It's way better than never getting your account back. 
Some tips for the future: 
Before deleting or uninstalling anything, go to settings and record whatever information you might need to restore or recover your account in the event any errors take place. In the case of Airbitz, this includes the answers to your password recovery questions and turning off 2FA (you can also export your wallet private seed from the wallet drop down list inside the app). Also, if you ever want to delete a bitcoin wallet app from a device, first send the funds to a new wallet that you definitely control. There are some really good temporary web/browser wallets out there, or if you have a large amount of bits not suitable for temporary storage in a hot wallet, use a hardware wallet or paper wallet with keys that were generated offline. Then uninstalling and reinstalling will be a lot less troublesome despite whatever errors may be encountered.

If you haven't tried Airbitz in the last 6 months, you should. Clunky? Unintuitive? It's the most mainstream user-friendly wallet in existence. Depending on your definition of SPV wallets, you might say Airbitz is or isn't, but the real point is that Airbitz paves over the potholes of so many common user-errors both with Bitcoin and with general account security, while still delivering all the privacy and security features inherent in Bitcoin. Bread is a solid wallet. It just works. Airbitz is far more powerful and useful than many in the Bitcoin community give it credit for. Try Airbitz, and you'll see why it's the only app worth recommending to people new to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:15:11
Airbitz is not SPV, but it does use a decentralized multi-server model to relay transactions. Airbitz is an incredible combination of ease-of-use and security/privacy. Anyone who can download an app off an app store can easily use Airbitz. Now, you can even buy/sell BTC by connecting to a non-custodial exchange, Like Glidera, from right inside the app. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:32:53
Airbitz mitigates these pitfalls for users and a variety of other user errors. Always zero knowledge encrypted locally. Always automatically backed up and accessible from any device of your choice, and even native two-factor so you can enable it and never bother with copy/pasting OTPs or using additional apps.  
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:30:52

Send funds from Coinbase to any other personal - non custodial - wallet (I prefer Airbitz, but KryptoKit works perfect in this case too). Then, after ~3 confirmations, send to your gambling site of choice. One degree of separation is all you should need to keep Coinbase from getting suspicious and closing your account. If you want more privacy and anonymity, then the process gets a lot more complicated, but one degree of separation from Coinbase is enough to get the job done while accepting the fact that blockchain forensic scientists are watching.

I'm not trying to disparage GGG, just hard to see why I would switch from Trees. The medicine is top flight. I get to try freebies of new products each time I order. Trees is not for the guy/gal who doesn't want to spend $150 per order. It's for people who want the highest luxury in their cannabis experience. There's so much room in the cannabiz for many players and many plays. No need to compete so hard in these early days. Everyone in the medicinal/recreational cannabis industry is competing against the black market and outmoded federal drug laws. Go Trees. Go GGG. ;P

You're not that far off base, actually.

Unless you have close to 6 figures of capital and access to hot-off-the-assembly-line mining hardware, it's likely not going to be profitable for you. But, actually, this sounds like a perfect case for the 21 "Bitcoin Computer." For a tiny fraction of what you'd pay for a major league mining rig, you could tinker with that toy and satisfy many of your curiosities. If you want to slowly acquire bitcoin in a relatively passive way, I would recommend the Lawnmower app (there's an iOS version!). I actually love getting the spare change from my bank card purchases multiplied (3x, sometimes I go 5x ;) and automatically purchased for me. Then, because I want to take advantage of the profundity of Bitcoin and retain full custody of my own value (and I love Airbitz too), I transfer the spare-change-turned-satoshis to my Airbitz wallet. It's a pretty awesome way to slowly stack coins and cost average your way into BTC at quite a low risk. Man, Bitcoin is so different now in 2015 than back in 2012-2013. It's amazing when you think about how far it's come in such a short time.

Airbitz won a pitch competition at San Diego Startup Week recently. The prize was 3 months of coworking space for free. With the MLB All-Star Week last week, Pride this weekend, and ComicCon next week, our office in the Gaslamp District (where the stadium and the convention center are located) is clogged with tourists and basically impassable. We decided to use the free office space we won for a few weeks to avoid the swarm and parking issues for our team. Renting the space for ComicCon (Airbitz office is literally across the street) is something everyone in this town does this time of year to make bank. Renting the desk space is a no-brainer, and as mentioned in another comment, it's a great way to bring more people into the fold of Bitcoin and startups in San Diego. Airbitz is not "scraping by," but rather gaining momentum. Lots of cool announcements impending for the weeks to come!

yeah, i've been verified for instant buys for months now. even added the visa card when they asked for that feature a few weeks ago.  last instant bought on Dec 6th.  Tried this morning and no dice.  Instant seems to be gone.  This is the only reason I have coinbase, and the only reason to have a coinbase acct IMO.  Damn shame they just close it without a notice of any kind.  Now my funds are tied up for who knows how long.

I'm on my way to the park. Will activate FB live upon arrival. T-minus 30mins.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:05:15
Same here!  I got an email from the FOX affiliate in Green Bay.  They're gonna come all the way down to Milwaukee tomorrow to interview and film our meetup tomorrow night :)

yeah.  im rooting for ya, but knowing illinois and chi-town, i'm not sure any private venture will have the stamina to outlast their suppression/aggression tactics.  keep us posted.

Thanks for posting, OP ;)
@_date: 2013-11-02 05:56:09
I appreciate the way you appreciated that!
As opposed to what I was going to comment after just reading the title, which was probably going to be quite rude. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:47:17
You haven't been here long, have you?
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:49:06

@_date: 2013-11-06 06:09:29

Hey there!  I'm the organizer for the [Milwaukee Bitcoin]( meetup group.  I've been amazed by the growth we've had since the summer, and excited to help new meetups in other locales be able to replicate our success.  I'm actually working on a project with other meetup organizers around the country (world?) to develop a modular kit of sorts to get meetups going and growing in cities/regions where they don't yet exist.   PM me sometime :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:06:07
Looking forward to seeing the full story!
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:25:29

Awesome!  The Blush Family is demonstrating a GREAT example.  
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:27:56
I'm so glad you linked this clip at that exact time, so I didn't have to.  I was about to clip this vid to share just this sequence and I was like, "ima go to r/bitcoin and check first."  ;)

Check out the "response" to this talk from the [New York Times]( 
"In practice, this vision calls for building actual communities that would be beyond the reach of the state that Silicon Valley’s libertarians despise. But in the near term, Mr. Srinivasan noted, there are piecemeal ways to opt out of the society — like spending unregulated digital currency, sleeping in unregulated hotels and manufacturing unregulated guns. What Mr. Srinivasan called “Silicon Valley’s ultimate exit,” he explained, “basically means build an opt-in society, ultimately outside the United States, run by technology.”
The speech won roars from the audience at Y Combinator, a leading start-up incubator. It earned hearty praise online as well — even as it worried others.
Nicholas Carr, author of “The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains,” said the speech was part of “a resurgence of millenarian thinking in Silicon Valley.” The dream of an extra-societal utopia grows in part out of a “naïve libertarianism” ascendant in the Valley, and in part out of older American cultist traditions dating as far back as the Pilgrims, he said."

Yes, yes, and yes.
