Thank you but at this point in time I would prefer no physical copy of my keys. This is due to current living and travel arrangements making this a huge security risk. That is why I was attracted to ColdCard air-gapped generation of keys offline, then encrypted backup offline. My thoughts was I basically then have a backed up wallet that the keys have never been online.

Update: This looks like a more practical method perhaps [

BUMP! Anyone else want to share their easiest most practical methods for air gapped cold storage? I'm struggling to find the right strategy right now.

Thank you, this has certainly tempered my excitement. So if I am not pushing my luck, what do you advise for the simplest way to setup cold/offline storage, where keys can be encrypted and backed up online, that is not going all the way to the effort and cost involved for the Glacier protocol ([glacierprotocol.org/](  Thanks.
