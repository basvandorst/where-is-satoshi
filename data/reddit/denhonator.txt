Also, the first one saying "without fees". The fees are smaller, but still there.

Opened the link, curious what the text is. OP has been creative

Helsinki is a bit too far away for me to visit for an ATM though
The site says the local rates are at around 500€/BTC. That doesn't sound right. What's wrong?

I learned quickly what I should avoid. I almost fell for it earlier though. Glad I didn't.

Wait, do you just presume the same law applies where he lives, as where you live?
I think that the law here in Finland says it's illegal for school staff to take anything at all from the students, unless it's something they aren't allowed to have it.

I'm not going to blame anyone for *making* me invest in bitcoins. I'm trying to figure out how I can get it done and what is the actual situation. I'm not planning on investing much either.
You were the one to start this thread here, other's have replied with advice on how to do it, which I was asking in the first place.

I really hope they have a good answer to this. Otherwise this won't become a thing.

It's not like I am looking to earn quick money. I just thought it would be a wise investment

Time for other big companies to learn!

So there's a fight here in this thread? Walls of text on every comment.
Anyway, I'm not planning on investing my life on it, I'm a student without big moneys. If I would invest 50-100€ and get anything more than that it'd be cool, but I could live with losing it.

For markups? Pardon me, I don't understand.

Are you sure they don't think they would be stealing?
