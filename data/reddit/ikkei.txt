I use [Bitpanda]( (EU) and so far I'm 100% satisfied with them. 
I can buy at 0% fee with SEPA transfers (EU banks only I suppose). The price, as usually on fiat exchanges, is a bit above market, but still it's fine.
Bitpanda is great.

I never thought of it this way. How exactly? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:12:37


I'm not so sure about that (the part about "cash" --I assume you mean [M0](
First of all the current form of fiat currencies is recent, in the United States for instance it only dates back to 1973 and has profoundly changed in nature at least 3 times in the 20th century alone. The Euro (EU) was introduced much more recently; it could be argued that it's still an experiment considering its trans-national nature.
Secondly, fiat/cash isn't necessarily physical in nature. That's why some people like Andreas Antonopoulos prefer to call cryptocurrencies "The Internet of Money" rather than "Digital Money", because fiats can (and have become, by far) digital assets (i.e. "bank accounts" with no physical counterparts, M0 being only a small amount of the total USD count, and most banks holding only as little as 10% of their total balances in actual physical cash).
Any or several things could happen:
* Fiat currencies (e.g. USD, EUR, YEN) becoming "crypto assets" as well (i.e. tied to a blockchain of sorts), there's nothing preventing an economic zone (more precisely, its central bank) from basically taking the next step to serializing its currency and pinning assets to a ledger of sorts.
* Digital cash making its apparition at last, perhaps by means of NFC technologies, becoming non-tangible anonymized assets (whoever holds X is the sole owner and legal user of X). You just refill the wallet through an ATM and use it like cash. Several attempts at this were made notably in the EU.
* Unpredictable black swan (e.g. collapse of the banking system, big-ass war, etc.) taking us back to a highly necessary use of ownership-less physical or digital assets for daily life. Given the tech at our disposal today, from cryptography to 3D printing passing by the mother of all potentialities called "internet", you bet there would be a slew of innovation to make our way through such a *swan-ish* historic time. For instance, a possible combination of the two above points (e.g. actual crypto-coins, 3D-printed with self-destructing private keys that you could barter for goods).
Before you think it's sci-fi, just remember that 1973 was 44 years ago, half the average life expectancy in some countries. 44 years ago there was no internet, no mobile, and color TV was just beginning to outsell black and white units in the richest countries. Thirty years before that, we were deep in the second world war. This total of 74 years is less than what's yet to come to conclude the 21st century.
So no, not sure we've seen "the final form of cash" or the final form of whatever for that matter. Re some people thought the late 19th century was the end of history. Well... *A few things* did happen since.
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:21:30
I... just... oh well. Let's dive in, for the sake of anyone reading.
1. Aren't you confusing the [Bloomberg Terminal]( with the TV/website news outlet? Because while they share a name these are not even remotely comparable, apples vs. tanks so to speak.
    Bloomberg Terminal = state of the art trading platform (hardware). Used throughout the industry by pro traders. The very existence of this category is why "trading floors" are a thing of the past except as a background for TV (layman shows).
    Bloomberg News (TV, website) = IGN for trading. Pros (and many amateurs) now better than to follow opinion pieces, it's much too shallow to amount to anything except breaking news (which are largely anticipated by pros).
2. Trading floor: largely for show nowadays. Traders work in offices. Computerization etc. Latency matters. A desk is better to analyze stuff. Paper is gone. No one shouts "buy" "sell" anymore.
3. You third paragraph is accurate. Don't forget Goldman Sachs too, reports are their bread and butter for major clients, up to governments and trade unions. TV pays a bit to get excerpts and general ideas, though vastly editorialized for the mainstream (i.e. opinion-driven as part of their image). It's like most major news outlets as we speak: you don't get "accurate" or "neutral" information, you just get a bit of emotion-spiking content to justify ad space.
     I'll say it again because your second paragraph is weirdly contradicting the third: media analysis is **not comparable** to professional reports by financial institutions. The financial media, just like any media these days, is just about click-n-bait and FOMO/FUD'ing and whatever brings audience to sell ads. It takes reading, books and reports (not articles and news anchors) to educate oneself about anything, and finance is no exception.
Hopefully the rise of cryptocurrencies will work in conjunction with the rise of alternative/new media aimed at informing the public (currently it's more like the opposite, driven by the worst instincts of human nature from the web to Youtube passing by nonsensical books and "experts". It's a dire time for quality information in this sea of emotions, the signal/noise ratio is as low as it was before the printing press).

Agreed, especially in an age where you can buy server capacity and roll it out within minutes provided you designed the infrastructure with speed/scaling in mind; something that I'm sure an online broker like Robinhood would have done already.
Few companies but the biggest ones actually *have* servers, most rent resources; it's much cheaper than hiring hordes of sysadmins etc.
And indeed slow rollouts are not only part of a well-managed software strategy, it's also part of a well-integrated marketing strategy often deemed crucial during initial phases ("lean" etc.)

Nice chart, thanks a lot for the link. Bookmarked! : )
I see your thinking, thanks for explaining. I remember reading something like that from Satoshi Nakamoto in a book containing all his posts. Still rather new to this so not everything flows automatically in my mind yet (I know programming to some extent but crypto is still new territory for me).
Thinking out loud: I hope that, as adoption increases (think: billions of people / transactions per day), we would have ever more nodes though --adoption would become its own incentive.
For instance, I'm launching a "digital transformation" agency for SMBs (fancy word to basically describe websites + online marketing + backend tools for inventory/supply/accounting management). I can see that business evolving to include crypto-payments eventually (although it's still a bit early, volatility is a problem for entrepreneurs looking for a stable medium/currency of exchange). 
As I see it, we'd basically equip merchants/businesses with mining hardware so they ran their own node to make payments as fast as possible, as the cost decreases and becomes negligible compared to the comfort of quick checkout. With RFID/NFC it could become as easy as walking out of the store, no cashier required.
Do you think that's a realistic vision, say for the early 2020s? (notwithstanding any delay caused by a crash or other macro-event)
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:46:09
You should read bitcoin's whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. It's strikingly clear. Really enlightening about why and how all this started too. 
There's also a great book called "The Book of Satoshi" which contains all the posts he ever made on bitcointalk.org, you'll get the true picture, the actual source. Much better than wildly inaccurate posts out here.
If one wants to learn further, look for Andreas Antonopoulos, he authored tons of great talks (available on YouTube) and also a book called "The Internet of Money" curating many of these talks into a well organized (and rather short) whole.
All of these sources helped me form a much more educated and dare I say 'sane' view of the crypto scene.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:02:34
Indeed. Not the same news you see on the mainstream channels though. There's a reason why a Bloomberg pro contract costs so much. It's not really news though. More like Reuters feeds, i.e.just facts without opinions. Miles away from the classic news anchor + guest discussions you see on TV.

It takes one to know one, though. 
I disagree with him if we consider crypto long-term. 
**His FUD is so little in historical terms.**
But to be fair, I think he's right that govs and central banks will fight tooth and nails against the advent of libertarian/decentralized cryptos; and imho they are quite likely (precedents...) to use the full force of ad hoc laws and Justice itself, however disingenuously, in order to issue cryptos of their own (the tech is sound, we know it) and/or keep the lion's share of the People's exchanging of value. 
You don't f\*ck with Wall Street and banks, especially of the central kind, not so casually that it's a fun run ending with all of us laughing our way to some bit ledger. Remember, these cats decide who gets elected or appointed to the highest offices in this world. Promises get made, the kind that holds. You don't take that kind of power without a ~~fight~~ *war*.
Short term, we all know that he's absolutely right that it's a crabs' basket wherein many crooks of all trades try to get away with as much as they possibly can. We actually pride ourselves around here on reddit, telegram etc. on being able to spot the bad apples in crypto --and many of us yet still do fall for many a scheme. You just have to look at one month worth of news to see that Mt Gox never was a singularity; more like a bull's classic. The kind that calls bears.
I don't know the magnitude, but I'm convinced there will be enough shit hitting the fan sooner or later to brutally upset the merry-happy trend we've seen in 2016-2017. It will get worse before it gets better.
**But it will get better, and this is where I don't agree with the FUD, however substantiated. It's like saying cars or electricity won't happen because it upsets horses breeders and candle makers. You don't stop progress, you can't kill and idea whose time has come. Shit will legitimately hit the fan because our streets are full of it, and it's about time we walk cleaner paths --looking at you, centennial orders.**
*Eventually*, there will be major winners, and the masses will be better for it. But it's gonna be a blood bath in between. Dead meat stinks.
For those about to keep hodling when that happens, it's just being able to withstand the winter without whatever's *in* the market, and choosing one's stakes carefully --*many* coins will die. Perhaps *some* nobody thought could die, perhaps by the very hand that no one thought could betray (again, historical precedents, you never know whose hands cats and whales shake behind the curtain). It's a shitshow of a situation right now, and everyone's in it for the big run.
Below us, scammers of all walks. Above us, the forces of old, the astronomical money hoovering above societies at large. In the middle, aspiring hordes of us, including project leaders and devs and evangelists, wannabe knights of the century who've already seen a new order, better for all, emerging nigh. Way higher above it all, they --we-- see the moon. Well under below the seas, ever-looming rifts of hell that inevitably take many as history unfolds. Don't think for one second that peasants would leave this cosmic fight without anything from a bruise to a timely (financial) death (but is that so different from the real thing, in this day and age of individual "freedom"). It shall be no consolation for the fallen that whiskers may well burn too.
**But think of it this way: had you invested in the market *correctly* before 1929, and held for about a decade and a war and another decade, you'd come out rich beyond measure.**
And things do happen much faster a century later as we speak.
As for the motives of a lone Wolf in all this... *I, for one, shan't speculate.*
Good night, reddit. May you see in it the light of civilization.

Bitcoin itself, no, it's "just" a commodity. However with the concept of smart contracts (really just programmatic blockchains, i.e. secure logs/records of activity), sky's the limit; there's no theoretical limit to what you can do.
There are several cryptos scrambling to bring financial services of all kinds to the masses, backed by blockchains (or DAGs, whatever secure ledger). Crypto, as a sector, is infused by an immense positive pressure to "translate" every activity in a decentralized, distributed and secure manner. E.g. Bitconnect might be a ponzi scheme, but eventually some real legit lending crypto-service is bound to emerge. And on and on with every financial service you can think of.
The motivation is clear: to eliminate as many middlemen as possible between people (individual and businesses) and the fulfillment of their activities (aka 'real' economics, actual work and value creation); at the very least to reduce economic "friction" (superfluous costs) to maximize profit of said real-world value creation. 
If you and I want to trade, why should we pay a third-party? And if we really must (e.g. to secure a big deal such as the selling of a house or car), why should we pay anything more than the least required to perform the contract?
The point isn't necessarily to kill banks, that's beside the point; the point is to make whatever or whoever performs the role that banks play in the economy as cost-efficient as possible. If it happens with banks, so be it, if it's without, so be it as well. 
I think the shift to crypto-techs won't happen without tremendous resistance by existing powers, notably from finance as a sector for those who won't adapt to crypto-innovation, and notably too from governments that seem to prey on surveillance these days (and love to tax a bit too much for the economy's sake). But eventually, probably after a crash and recession and some kind of apocalypse/war, the shift will happen.
Think then-leading companies resisting internet, and look at today's leaders such as Google, Netflix, in pretty much all sectors. Before that, leading companies who resisted electricity, or the car, or plastics.

Consider this: books (~500,000 chars) &gt; twitter (140 chars).
Reddit lies somewhere in between (10,000 chars).
On topic. So I can understand your thinking, can you please elaborate? Define "better" a bit more in this case?
* If BTC is "objectively better" than gold for the purpose of storing value, then you think the market cap of BTC should surpass gold market cap, is that correct? Do you disagree there's more to these assets valuation/cap than this one dimension, enough that they can't be compared directly?
* Does that mean BTC doesn't "compete" quantitatively with USD or other currencies? Maybe that other cryptos would be more adequate in that regard?
* Why gold and not debt securities or other assets?

I don't think a cryptocurrency of any sort competes with any physical commodity. It all depends on which aspect/use you consider. 
I won't manufacture jewels or electronics using bitcoins any time soon. 
I probably won't use much gold as a hedge against fiat collapse now that cryptos exist. Although the safest way will probably be to use both cryptos and non-perishable commodities to hedge in this century (water too might become very expensive).
I don't see how these things are "either/or." 
I didn't skip anything, in fact I never meant to be comprehensive.
Gold market cap is closer to 8 trillion. It won't go away because of bitcoin. Bitcoin's rise in value wouldn't be slowed down if we discovered a huge gold mine tomorrow. These things are not related, let alone correlated. 
Bitcoin is not a commodity, it's just that financially it behaves more like commodities than stocks, contrary to the popular belief (Satoshi himself pointed that out, I often quote him in that regard, to kill BTC market cap comparisons to stocks market cap, because it's nonsensical).

EU here, I began with coinbase because that was the popular one everybody talks about.
It's slow, crashes often, they have issues (e.g. ETH) for hours when other exchanges don't, and the fees are stupidly high (I know, GDAX, doesn't solve much).
I've tried other exchanges from/to fiat, and haven't looked back since (**Bitpanda** here in Europe, to name just one, it's incredibly fast). 
I hear Gemini (US only) is very good.
I have yet to try Bitstamp but it seems OK too.
I just don't understand how Coinbase can be so popular with such an awful availability of their services, and slow as hell processing of transfers to alt-coin exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:45:16
FWIW, USD in circulation in 2013 were estimated to 10.5 trillion, 1.5 of which were M0 (coins and bills). And that's by far the most used currency on earth, called "reserve currency" for its superior stability compared to other fiat currencies.
I don't think it's realistic that BTC, a currency not really used for payments (yet) could reach a market cap even remotely equivalent to the most popular currency (USD).
Now don't get me wrong: I absolutely believe that eventually cryptoccurencies will replace fiat currencies. 
Central banks, and many banks, should just die considering how catastrophic a situation they put us in (real people doing real work in the real economy) on a regular basis just for their own profit.
I don't know if it will be bitcoin and/or whatever else, but eventually it's going to happen. Possibly before 2030. Definitely before 2050.
But these things take a little time. It took about 10 years for BTC to reach an ~5% awareness, next we have to reach true awareness/use, then disillusion (that BTC won't fix the economy or be the end of financial history in and out of itself, only make it more efficient), and finally adoption by mainstream entities (from your boss to your spouse and your ma' passing by your insurance company and Burger King; note that two of these examples might be one and the same in some not-so-fringe cases).
Now that being said, it will eventually reach $1M, at which point we'll probably count in satoshis (1 cent of a dollar). A full bitcoin will look like a big bar of gold (currently: 1 bar of gold is $506,400).
The real questions are:
* what will drive the shift from fiat to crypto?
* how much resistance will central banks and government oppose? (even if cryptos prove to be more secure and more stable, bankers have a lot to lose and will fight for their profits on old fiats; the so-called "democratic" forces, i.e. the peoples of earth, will have to impose cryptos in some way or another, and this might prove to be a drag for years, if not decades).
* will the singularity kick off first, at which point we'll all have become cryptocurrencies anyway as our body becomes a block on some chain in the matrix. yay!
Meanwhile,

Thank you, I see your view better now. Makes sense.
I agree most altcoins are B.S. (they just PR the basics of blockchain tech), the hard part is to identify which are not, if any yet. I have interest in a few, but it's just belief at this point. 
Eventually I'm convinced we'll use *many* cryptocurrencies (hundreds worldwide), depending on the use case. Not sure BTC itself will be the go-to currency for most things (notably because it's deflationary), but that's almost beyond the point, *some* crypto will do that anyway.
There's a take by Andreas Antonopoulos that [cryptocurrencies will become some form of meta-political statement]( that I interpret as the ultimate realization of the "vote with your wallet" idea. I think he's on to something. It's big. Much bigger than gold or any financial asset. His book "The Internet of Money" is really great, lots of good food for thought. Notably the idea of an index to value a multimodal cryptowallet.
But before all that, central banks are gonna put one unprecedented hell of a fight to resist that change --or control it somehow.

Chapter 7. Currency as a Language
An interesting question comes up, actually quite a few people have asked me: "Does Ethereum threaten the future of bitcoin? Does it steal some of its thunder?" Those are questions I’ve heard several times, and I’ve heard people refer to that issue in trying to understand altcoins - wondering whether altcoins essentially threaten the dominance of bitcoin, if they make bitcoin weaker, if they distribute the value of the network too broadly.
7.1. Born into Currency
I think, fundamentally, it’s a question that evokes the old paradigm of currencies. We’ve all grown up in a world where currencies are forced upon us in a monopolistic fashion, where currencies are defined strictly by the geographies in which they occur, and where the choice of currency is not yours. It is an accident of birth, just like many other things in our lives.
Currency, as we understand it, is an artifact of the nation-state. It imposes upon us certain constraints. We don’t choose our currency; it chooses us. We are forced to use that currency in all of our interactions. We don’t have a choice — until 2008, that is. We now live in a slightly different world, but a lot of the old paradigm persists in our thinking.
In a world where your currency is a monopolistic nation-state artifact that is constrained by geography, it’s a zero-sum game. The currency is the flag, is the nation-state.
7.2. Currency as a Means of Expression
Now, we live in a new world, a world in which currency is a choice, and not just a choice in terms of use. It’s not just a matter of being able to choose which currency we use as individuals. It’s also a means of expression. Any of us can now create a currency using a simple web form.
As I thought about the evolution of alt-currencies, as they’re called, I realized I was asking the wrong questions. How many currencies will there be? How many altcoins will there be? How will altcoins compete in a world of cryptocurrencies as we move into the future? Will there be hundreds of altcoins? If there are hundreds of altcoins, what does that mean for the value of each of the altcoins? How do they compete? That was the wrong way of thinking about it. I saw currency as a zero-sum game, just like it had been imposed on my worldview from the nation-states that created currency. Then, I started thinking of currency as an application. And then, I started thinking of currency as a means of expression.
7.2.1. Inventing Currency on the Playground
One of the things that really captivated me was understanding that if you have a primary-school environment and you watch children in their natural habitat (a very unnatural habitat in most schools), young children don’t have currency, and they don’t understand currency. But they invent currency. They start trading. Rubber bands, Pokemon cards, Tamagotchi, tokens of affection, tokens of popularity. Humans create currency as a means of expressing their desires, of expressing their individuality. I thought, What happens when a five-year-old in a primary school can use a website to create Joeycoin to compete against Mariacoin in a game of popularity within their school?
Then it dawned on me: To ask the question, "How many currencies will exist?" is equivalent to asking the question, "How many bloggers will there be on the internet?" The answer is simple: all of us.
Currency is now a means of expression.
We’re not going to have hundreds of altcoins. We’re not going to have thousands of altcoins. We’re going to have hundreds of thousands, and then millions of altcoins. Then, there will be thousands of altcoins being created every day to organize local communities to express fads, to create popularity contests, to codify the latest internet meme.
7.5. Valuing Currencies by Use
We need to get ready to live in a world where multiple currencies will coexist.
7.5.1. Multiple Currencies Coexist
Currency as a means of expression, currency as a tool of language, is no longer up to the issuer. It is up to us as individuals making a choice to use that currency, and we give it value through our use.
We’re going to have currencies for different uses. Already, you have bitcoin that provides a very specific monetary policy. You have Ethereum that can provide a contract platform. There’s Namecoin for distributed naming conventions. There are many others, and there will be many others that will solve other problems: protein folding, the search for extraterrestrial life. Maybe we’ll have currencies that are better for microtransactions and micropayments with very fast resolution. Maybe we’ll have currencies that are better for larger transactions, like real estate. Who knows. If you think of currency as an application, then you realize that it doesn’t really matter.
On the internet, email was the granddaddy of them all. Or the grandma of them all. Email, like bitcoin, was the killer app that allowed us all to see the power of decentralized communications and adopt this new platform. It was enough to create utility to spread this network all around the world, but it was only the first app. Then, instant messaging, forums, bulletin boards, Facebook, Twitter. Do you worry that Twitter will destroy email? Do you worry that Facebook will destroy instant messaging? Do you worry that the value of email is eroded somehow by the existence of Twitter? We don’t worry about these things because we understand that each one serves a different purpose. 
What we do is we build interfaces, we build abstractions, we build unifying tools that allow us to use all of these modalities from a single interface and fluidly move from one to the other. 
7.5.2. Currency as an App
I think that’s what’s going to happen with currency. We’re going to start treating currency as an application, and in order to do that we’re going to need interfaces that allow us a unified currency experience, that allow us to have a single wallet with perhaps 150 different currencies in it. Because of inventions like sidechains, decentralized exchanges, fluid liquid systems and the complete absence of monopoly, of lock-in, of hostage situations around the currency, we will be able to instantaneously and at very low cost convert from bitcoin to Namecoin to Dogecoin to Ethereum. If we can do that, then it doesn’t matter because we won’t do that; our unified wallet interface will do that, by trying to see what we’re trying to achieve with our currency. If I’m buying a house, it might express my transactional will in the modality of bitcoin because that is the most suitable currency. When I try to name the domain for that house, it will convert some to Namecoin. The contract itself will be paid in ether. When I tip the bartender for the cup of coffee they gave me when I got up that morning, I’ll tip them in Doge. My interface will hide all of these differences.
I can see a world in which we can smoothly move between currencies in a multimodal way. There’s one other thing that comes out of this, which is the very real possibility that we will abstract value in exchange rate from the actual currency.
7.5.3. Index Currency
There’s a very real possibility we’re going to have an index currency: a currency that is not in itself tradable, that has no intrinsic use as a transactional commodity, but instead is only used to express the purchasing power vis-a-vis the various coins in our wallets.
We’re probably going to see meta-currencies whose only purpose is to aggregate the value in all of our wallets for all of our currencies, and allow us to understand value as an abstraction that exists independently of the currencies in which it’s expressed.
7.6. Choosing Currencies and Communities
So, that’s a slightly philosophical perspective. That’s why I think it doesn’t matter: Ether is not competing with bitcoin; bitcoin is not competing with Litecoin. They are all means to express the transactional modality we want to use at any point in time to achieve our goals. With this comes a very important and powerful tool. In the choices we make with these currencies, we are also choosing to align ourselves with a community.
We have entered the realm of meta-politics, of politics by algorithm, of the ability for global communities to form around a common consensus of politics through the choice of currency. You want inflation? Use an inflationary currency. You’re a goldbug? Use a deflationary currency. You want a currency that creates a guaranteed minimum income for the poor? Use a currency that expresses those politics. You want a currency that puts aside tokens for carbon sequestration? Use a currency that expresses your green politics. We’re going to start seeing communities, politics, and currencies converge and allow us to make these choices.
We’re past the zero-sum game. This isn’t about nation-states anymore. This isn’t about who adopts bitcoin first or who adopts cryptocurrencies first, because the internet is adopting cryptocurrencies, and the internet is the world’s largest economy.
7.7. Currency Creates Sovereignty
To summarize, we’ve inverted the very basic and most fundamental equation of currency. For millenia, until the year 2008, sovereignty defined currency. Sovereignty was the basis upon which currency could be created, and that currency allowed that sovereignty to be expressed. The monopolistic control of currency is the basis of sovereignty. Now, the internet has a currency. The internet is going to use that currency to create sovereignty.

Yeah that was my initial thought when reading about your app (hence my other comment/question to you). Actually starting from a web app, as a universal/common base so to speak, and then adapting the frontend part to mobile (essentially displaying a web app inside an iOS/Android app). I suppose you've already got a common backend for the apps, though.
However, don't think that people are *all* about desktop 'comfort'. We, desktop-users, are a dying species, which indeed includes many devs and many traders and a few gamers, people who couldn't do their job/hobby without a desktop. But most people? The 'mainstream'? Overwhelmingly fine with being all-mobile. Which may or may not coincide with being overwhelmingly fine not reading —let alone writing— long messages.
I often giggle in Fb groups, when I write a post/comment 3 paragraphs long and someone responds "too long - won't read - get out this isn't college" in a demeaning way. It seems that it's much easier to watch netflix for 5 hours than read for 5 minutes these days.
Basically I wouldn't worry about it before testing the waters (surveys, A/B testing, whichever way you can find to see if there is high demand for a web/desktop interface).

Came here to say this. In particular, didn't pursue a career in video games because it was universally rejected as stupid and childish when I was younger.
It's especially true when there's a generational divide in the adoption. It's a cliche (but cliches often spell the truth) that "if you like it but your parents don't, the media/society will usually paint it evil/dangerous/bad"
From what I read, it was already true in Ancient times (Egypt, Athens, Roman Empire, etc.); kids would get scolded by their mentors and parents for liking things that weren't to the taste of the mainstream. 
If I were bold, I would surmise that there is a link between this and globalization: being exposed to new stuff usually attracts the young ("let's change the world with these new ideas"), and frightens the old ("let's protect and conserve our hard-earned culture and assets").
