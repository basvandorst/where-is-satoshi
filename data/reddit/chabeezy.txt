Honestly, its like none of the people replying to me have heard of triage.
Even if you're rushed off your feet, it makes much more sense to have someone prioritise issues and then work through them in priority order. You know, that way issues that would be hugely damaging to your company, or even causing regulatory issues won't just be left for months! 
Feel like I'm taking crazy pills here.

What sort of shitty ass company do you work for that doesn't work through calls in a priority order? 
If it worked like that you could have an entire site down whilst you dealt with a minor config issue at another client!

Has anyone on this subreddit heard of the concept of sunk costs?

If bitcoin has no use other than as a store of value, it actually has no use at all. 
The fact you are saying it’s deflationary so why spend it, is like the number 1 criticism of bitcoin (yet you seem to be listing it as a positive)

Do american's not have online banking? 
In the UK all of these problems are solved by the internet. You can just send money from your bank to another one.
Or you can use one of the plethora of services that do it for you like Pingit. Most banks even allow you to text cash now. 
They all have apps for it.. Just seems strange that these problems still happen in America.

I'll sell you a vcr for $200. That may seem expensive but it cost $500 new in the 80s

The op is full of shit. His mum has turned on internet filtering.
I can access the website and I'm a sky user.

Just so you all know, Sky is only blocking this website to people who have asked to have the internet filter turned on (eg. OP's mum most likely)
I'm a sky customer and I can access it no problem.
Here is proof;
