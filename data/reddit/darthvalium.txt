If lightning eventually works on a consumer friendly level, what is keeping other cryptos from just implementing the code? It's all open source, right?
While I think blockchain technology is here to stay, we simply can't know if Bitcoin specifically will be the one. It could very well be the MySpace of blockchain projects for all we know.

How do you deal with the extreme volatility? You must have deep pockets to be able to still pay your bills when Bitcoin drops 80% again.

The analogy doesn't really work because the beauty of open source is that no party can control software forks. You don't get to decide what others do with the code and that's good. Keeps people in charge of the "official" repository from going on power trips.

You lost me at step 1. Seriously, Bitcoin will never take off if it stays so inaccessible.

I like the April fools as well, which is funny because it's one of those cheap clip show episodes that the Simpsons love to make fun of.

This actually shows that deflation is bad.

That's the exact amount I invested when 1 BTC was 300$. I wish I had invested 2000 instead...

Haha. I tried to buy some at 4k and it didn't work. I gave up.
