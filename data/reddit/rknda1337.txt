Yeah, in Sweden I've used both safello and btcx, but safello is by far the best experience. Just register, confirm ID with Mobile BankID (an app backed by banks to confirm ones identity, literally takes a second), order bitcoins with Swish (another app for instant transactions), wait until they process it and boom bitcoins. The last step is where it takes time right now, usually in the ~1hr range for me, but they are working on an automatic system for it - which they might have released now, haven't checked. I was really surprised by how well done their service (and website) was. We are getting closer! :o)
Edit: Oh btw, safello currently works in 11 countries and it's goal is to be the coinbase of Europe! (I think bankid and swish are native to Sweden, though, so your experience may differ)

I don't think you need a computer that's never been online to set it up securely. You can generate &amp; print out brand new paper wallets that has never seen the internet (??) on  as far as I understand it anyway!
Or maybe someone else can explain how the printing of paper wallets that site is safe? I don't fully know how it works myself
To answer your second question; yes, if your private key (a long string) for that specific wallet is known by someone else, they can control that wallet

chill out man, its a running joke where the bitcoin price always falls after some good news (paypal, richard branson, winklevoss, etc - you don't think those are big enough to influence the price? -in the long run of course-) :-P

It will also "let" eBay use direct Bitcoin payments without using PayPal as an intermediary (if they want to)

"BITCOIN: THE STORY SO FAR"-Carousel is terrible! By the time I've scrolled to it, it's already shown a few pictures, and it keeps auto-changing when I navigate. Not very user friendly :(

Yes, I cant even see the first B in the title on reddit is fun (android). Such usability!
@_date: 2015-08-30 10:48:37
Heh, mine got rejected apparently. Should be fine since I was missing an extra connected account :-P

Has it gone through for you yet?
@_date: 2015-07-10 22:01:17
Isn't the entire problem because of slow network speeds in countries with lousy internet infrastructure, where mining is being done?
@_date: 2015-07-30 13:01:28
More like by using Windows 10 :P Still gunna get it tho :(

I also do webdev, if this guy doesn't have the time, I might! (In Sweden, not that it matters much to bitcoin). Feel free to PM for reference work

Not if Linux was a brand new thing and FreeBSD was a spinoff to that brand new thing that, just like Linux, still was really new and interesting. FreeBSD would also come with new improvements that could benefit Linux directly. Removing discussion could directly harm Linux development, could it not?
The only thing this "censoring" has accomplished seems to me to be stifling of innovation. :\
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:54:43
I think it's supposed to streamline the process for everyone involved (right now pretty much just devs I assume), by being easier to set up, just press play? Which means that everyone else that has one can try out the same apps/code/whatever?
I don't think they actually need to sell a lot of this device to accomplish what they want (developer feedback, maybe some software, maybe funding). The next device (unless they release another "devkit") will be the killer that is both cheaper, smaller, and gets marketed to sell like crazy. The real killer could be the apps/services that are developed with the one they just released. But I'm pretty much just guessing here, sorry if I'm totally wrong :P
@_date: 2015-09-05 15:00:45
Yes, there should always be a line to draw. That line might be drawn way too soon in this case, though, right?

How many world wars has there been before fiat vs after? ;) Not saying causality either, but the point is dumb either way.

Ah yes, but when you're big enough to bring in your own crowd (say a really big tech news site or something), you could just put the pay-barrier on your "premium" pages/articles. If google wants to index those? ...Maybe it just wont. Google is big enough to make the decision right now and just ignore those sites, but in a possible ad-free future based on micropayments, it might have to.. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 14:19:46
Yes, you are probably right! But hard to predict the future, it is :-)

I have a big issue with Deluge. When deleting completed torrents, if they were still listed in Deluge, it will download them again. I think there's been a feature request to fix this for more than 6 months at least.

Thanks for the very informative post. I have not yet contributed to any open source projects, and this would certainly be a great app to start at.
I'm very stacked with personal projects, but still slighly curious. I guess I could just google, but if you're feeling up to it, ELI5 how to compile a python project like this? (Never touched the stuff)
@_date: 2015-10-22 12:35:45
If you would previously have though "Gee, I'll have to declare this when doing my taxes", you don't have to any more. I guess.

Thanks a lot! I saved your comment and will look into it when the time is right!
@_date: 2015-10-25 11:26:47
I did a quick check but it's way above my skills (don't even know basic python, even though it looks simple), I'm afraid I would fuck shit up.
It does seem like a simple solution to the cunning: there's an *is_finished* variable in the torrentstate object(?) inside *torrentmanager.py*. It probably gets set to false again if the files are removed (or rechecked, as this redownload occurs on restart of the app). I can imagine a few different solutions to getting around this, but I don't know if some users want to keep this functionality and thus it would need to be an option that can be enabled/disabled as well.
