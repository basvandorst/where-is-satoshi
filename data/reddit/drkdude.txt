Wouldn't the best solution for all miners be to use P2Pool? It would give them zero fee and make a 51% attack absolutely impossible. The only people to lose money would be the current pool operators. Am I missing something here?

Transaction times are currently a few seconds. Are you complaining about confirmation times? Credit card purchases take anywhere from 2-6 weeks to confirm. Bitcoin takes an hour to do six confirmations. Seriously, just what in the fuck are you complaining about?

Sorry for saying that it looked like a scam. I can see that you have genuine interest in developing a tool that some, although not many, people would be like to use. I would be willing to help you with advice on how to run a more successful Kickstarter campaign. 
If you are interested, first look at all the differences between the Gitchain project and your project. There are many, many differences. PM me if you would like to discuss this further.

26 lower case letters
26 upper case letters
10 numbers
44 characters in a wallet address
(26+26+10)^44 = ???
Yeah, you won't be getting an address that is already used. Not a chance.

The title of this thread should be "Top 5 Books for Learning About Bitcoin" or "Top 5 Books About Bitcoin for Beginners".

Wall Streeters are waiting for 100% clear regulation with cryptocurrency being traded on the NYSE in some form. The Winklevoss twins are working harder than anybody else to make this a reality, and they will soon succeed.
People in the Phillipines hardly ever use the internet compared to people in the USA or China. You have to realize that just because they have a connection to the internet, they do not necessarily use it for hours per day like we do. They have maybe a few minutes per day of online access in many parts of the 3rd world. It takes them much longer to learn about anything online that it would take for you and me. I can spend 18 hours a day in front of my computer if I want, but if I had to spend all day fetching well-water, fishing in the ocean, and rebuilding my boathouse, then I'd be lucky to get 18 minutes per day.
NYC will be all in once regulatory fog is cleared, and people in the Phillipines will slowly hear the good news about bitcoin 18 minutes at a time.

Seattle has a bar called Fuel that accepts BTC payment. You might also be able to get some at the Wood Fired Pizza Company in Seattle.

If you send your coins to a different address, then nobody can ever tell who is using the bitcoin. You don't even need to use a coin tumbler. I sell my goods using address A, then I send the money to address B. As long as I never buy anything from my customers using address B, they will have no way of knowing that address B is actually mine.

In a world where basically everything is going be run using bitcoin, these short-sighted fools will never be able to get a good paying job for the rest of their lives.

Everybody who mines bitcoin uses Linux and a Raspberry Pi. Also, your project page looks like a scam. Here is an example of one that doesn't:

"Everyone ignores the 51% attack problem." - Aaron Greenspan
You can tell this idiot never talks to bitcoiners. We watch those hashrates like a hawk and will gladly take down pools by force if they get aggressive. Plus there is the advent of P2Pool, which will forever destroy the possibility of 51% attack. Nobody ignores this issue. Aaron is just an ignorant fool.
