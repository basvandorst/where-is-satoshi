That depends. I have seen much larger transfers.


If you sell your 2M USD house, that will also land in your bank account in one sum.
You should speak to your bank about things like that in advance though.
I don't know exactly how the FDIC insurance in the US works exactly, but I think it's limited to 250K per account - and I don't know if that can be increased. But for other cases where the FDIC is not paying, you can definitely make an arrangement with the bank.


I agree, but not for that one reason.

The seed for the other app was safely written down, then I actually used a Dremel tool with a diamond tip to write it on a small piece of stainless steel sheet metal. That's where my paper wallet backups are. Sealed in a tamper evident envelope. :-)

Pools do not work this way.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:24:37
**Nobody** does that. 
Good luck telling your buyer to send the money to 8 different bank accounts. 
What you do if your balance exceeds the standard FDIC insured 250K limit, you distribute it into multiple accounts after it arrived.
And you can easily work around that limit on a single bank (as it is not per person, per bank).
But if you do transactions like that on a regular basis, accounts at some private bank might be more convenient anyway - and you would not care much about the FDIC insurance.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:38:21


I agree.


YES, absolutely. 100%.
Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft are *not* amazing companies. 
Damage to banks would hurt more people, more directly. (And that is the banks fault, and/or due to lack of insurance of funds. Think FDIC for 401K)
But on the other hand, banks are hurting people today, and have been for ages. So why not rip that bandaid off in one go... While I do not think this is going to happen.

Absolutely no excuse for bad practices.

@_date: 2017-12-12 12:21:21
Correct me if I'm wrong:
Last November during the BCH pump/dump, they had as many transactions as BTC. 
Confirmation times and fees did *not* rise to BTC levels.
Bitcoin Cash has severe flaws, but **for the moment** their ...lets say "solution" - for the scaling problem works.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:15:05
5% is a sea of calm.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:38:21


Clarification might be needed:
The scaling was about transaction volume (as in number of transactions). Bitcoin (BTC) has an (arbitrary) lower limit on transactions that are possible to "go through the network" per second. That is per design, due to the blocksize being fixed at 1 mb.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:11:54
You can, in theory.
In reality, "guessing" is completely impossible.
Bitcoin uses a 256 bit private key, that means that there are 2^256 private keys you would have to try.
That's 2*2*2*2*...*2*2*2 (256 times)

Punch letters. The cheapest set on amazon will be ok for this application :-). I don't know how they work on stainless steel though, only used them on cast iron or very soft steel.
Those machines are pretty expensive and way over the top, no? 
Another option is to mark a grid on the sheet, and use a small drill to encode the letters with holes.
There are also some commercial options with moveable types etc, but they are pretty expensive for a single-task item that you will hopefully only see twice. (Once when you create it, once when you destroy it.)

But they might (probably, even) have to replace it. So, not your problem eventually :-).
"Hacking" a bank account is more difficult than "hacking" a credit card though. Was there just a debit, like someone used "your" debit card, or did someone log into your online banking? Did you use their 2FA? Did the thieves?

Is it really? Opening an account on Coinbase (GDAX) or Gemini is not more complicated than opening a bank account online. In my experience it was easier and faster.

If your system is somewhat secure (aka: do not click on phishing mails and avoid russian casino sites), you are probably good.
As in a bank transfer, make sure the amount is correct. Then, when you have to manually enter the "fee", make sure you do not switch it with the amount field. That has happened, and makes miners very happy.
Copy &amp; paste the recipient address, and double check it pasted the correct address.
Hit send, to to blockchain.info and see if the recipient address got the transaction, and wait for confirmations.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:43:24


If you are intellectually honest, you have to admit that this does not make sense:
There was Bitcoin. With 1mb blocksize.
Some people changed the protocol to larger blocks, splitting the chain.
You now have two chains. One identical to the one before the split, one different. 
In what world does it make sense to identify the new chain with Bitcoin?
The answer is: In a world where Roger Ver decided to "rebrand" Bitcoin Cash to "bitcoin". 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:49:57
You are absolutely right when you are talking about $5 fees for moving thousands of $ in BTC.

Did look them up more thoroughly after signin up... I was under the impression that large Crypto Exchanges all have a minimum level of trustworthiness. I do not trust them anymore.
Even with higher volumes of ID verification, you could EASILY outsource that (as many enterprises do).
Other exchanges and banks do that in MINUTES, or a day, tops.
They are verifying my credentials to enable SEPA withdrawals. 
Since last week.
Nope'd the fuck out there by moving my BTC back to GDAX.

You don't know how many bytes he send.
The amount of BTC or the value in fiat does not contribute to the fees required for practical confirmation times.
You can send USD 1,00 in BTC to a lot of addresses in one transaction, requiring extremely high fees.

Yes. I am probably worse to be around than a vegan crossfitter.
At home, I mitigated that situation by buying a little bit of BTC for my wife, now she monitors the charts as well :D.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:42:06
So, you want someone to etch your private keys into metal?
They could just monitor your BTC value from then on, and steal them once there is something in the account.
Get some sheet metal, write on the seed/key with a permanent marker, and use a Dremel tool with an metal engraving bit to write on it.
That's not beautiful, but cheap and it works good enough.
Idea: Maybe look into acid etching: Transfer print to metal sheet, use acid to chew away uncovered areas.
But whatever you do, I would not mail your sensitive information to a workshop to have them do it :-).

* development costs from exchanges, wallet devs, miners, 3rd parties
* research costs from investors, exchanges, miners
* "small" customers, if they even knew about the fork, were confused and concerned
* that whole futures-trading nonsense
Calling that resisting... I don't know. It was ugly.

My situation though:
The order of magnitude of my "investment" is about that of one month income from my job.
It is not my life savings or ensuring my living standards (yet *g*).
And I am only buying that much more BTC that this will not change.
I am learning a ton about the underlying technologies (IT background helps), how exchanges work (the UX, not trading), and how trading works.
It still results in ...less sleep. Not because I fear my moneys slipping away, but because it's... fascinating and exciting :-). I have become more relaxed with every dip and recovery though.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:34:35


I think about use cases for blockchain currencies a lot. 
Fiat is king when it comes to paying everyday purchases (coffee, pizza, groceries, clothes). Hand over cash, put in card, done. Has worked for decades, no problem for the customer.
Think about what a blockchain does: It is a global, distributed ledger with proof of every transaction ever made. It may sound cool to pay coffee with "Crypto", but do you need 20.000 confirmations 3 years later for that transaction?
It absolutely makes sense as a store of value, proof of wealth, for substantial transactions and contracts. Buy a car for $50K? Transfer money to someone in another country? Maybe even anonymous? Not cool with cash, not cool with credit cards, and bank transfers (even SEPA) take 2-3 days. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:57:10




Thank you. It was not the fear of losing my BTC during the last dip, but the FOMO during the short BCH pump (where I would have sold too late, probably.)
All I currently have in BTC is money I made with BTC ;-). My original investment is back in my bank account, and if I lose my BTC, I will miss a vacation, nicer car or a new watch. Not food or housing :-).
I will HODL from now on. I learned that beating the market, especially for smaller dips, is extremely hard for amateurs.

Better. But: When they have a CNC engraving machine or a laser cutter/engracer, that machine has an extremely convenient "repeat" function. For the last couple of jobs sent to it. From a computer, which also caches.

Yes. I stopped "advertising" BTC for everyday payments a while ago, and was shocked to see that sending any fraction of BTC is only feasible for fees of USD 5 or higher.
I always wonder why stores accept BTC for everyday transactions - that can not be feasible.
Paying your coffee or new shirt with BTC? Nonsense.
Paying for your car? Your contractor that just did something in your house for USD 10K? GREAT IDEA!
Why bring huge amounts of cash? Or wait 3 days for a bank transfer?

Psychology is a bitch. 
You transfer money to the exchange, and then it's just enough to buy  0.499871 BTC, or 0.248812 or 0.971431. 
0.51, 0.26 or 1.1 are also ugly, but do not feel quite so icky.

Look at the code. 
There are tons of tutorials out there with absolutely easy and beginner-proof ways to get started. The threshold is really low.
Get Raspian on your SD card.
Connect the Display (get one of the standard 2x40 LCD ones, they are really cheap).
Login to Raspian. 
Create the code for the Display, starting with something like "Hello World!" (tutorials!)
From there on, make adjustments to the code to display whatever you want. From looking at the source code, you can learn how it works. Look at his example: there are comments.
You would just have to add a few lines in here:
    def func():
      threading.Timer(10.0, func).start()
      lcd.clear()
      f = urllib2.urlopen("
      json_data = f.read().decode("utf-8")
      data = json.loads(json_data)
      guthaben = float(str(data["last"])) * var1
      lcd.message("BTC/USD= " + str(data["last"]) + space + "Guthaben: " + str(guthaben))

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:46:33
Very short and probably at least a little wrong:
You make a bet: I give you 1000 BTC in February. For a fixed price we negotiated today.
If the prices fall, I win: I can buy the BTC I owe you in February for cheap. If they rise, I have a problem: I need to buy them for whatever the price has risen to.
(At least for this last paragraph do your own research. I have no idea what I am talking about. Just summarizing the threat.)
If I go "long" on BTC, it is like the above, vice versa.
So, now... if there is a lot of indication (statistics, experience, indicators, secret aggreements, evil masterplans) that the price will decrease drastically, and futures-trading starts, that might get wild.

Verification was extremely quick in my case, and SEPA transfers arrive 1-1.5 days at Coinbase, where they can be moved to GDAX instantly and free. They take 0.15 Euro for SEPA, each direction. (Euro-cent, not per-cent.)
Other way around was also very fast, I think the banks and the SEPA system have been the bottleneck in both directions.
I don't know for USD transfers in the US, or those wire transfers... Is it so much worse?
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:33:32
It depends.
For a coffee, it's dumb and useless. And really, no blockchain needs those purchases.

Sealed, tamper-evident envelopes (edit: or normal envelopes with tamper-evident stickers on every seam. Take pictures of the envelope.) Stored at a notary. There are some that deal with much larger values on daily basis, and are extremely trustworthy.
If your BTC get stolen by the firm, you probably have a good chance in court, because you can prove they accessed your envelope. But you won't have to, because that is probably not going to happen anyway.
Also, don't store backups for everything on one location. Divide it in, e.g., 4 packs.

GDAX *is* Coinbase (same company, same login works!) with a user interface directed at people who know what they do.
GDAX is Coinbase with much, much lower fees. 
It is not difficult or complicated to buy there - quite the opposite. When you have funds deposited (you can move them instantly and for free between Coinbase and GDAX), buying and selling is done with 1 click - that's REALLY fast, but THINK before you click.
Make up your decision how much and when to buy, then put your order in GDAX under "MARKET -&gt; Buy/Sell", hit buy/sell, and you are done.
Do not get overwhelmed by the other information displays, if you do not have the feeling/knowledge to you require it.
Btw, with CTRL+"+" the text gets larger, and GDAX zooms in quite well. 
Once your funds are moved from Coinbase to GDAX, you only "need" the interface on the left:

Playing devils advocate here:
Bank account and account activity is extremely regulated. There are multiple layers of automated flagging systems in place. Plus possible human layers, should the occasion arise.
Not all of these layers are dictated by the bank - which would not give a shit - but the government.
Reasons are: Money laundering, drugs, tax evasion, terrorism, staging deposits, detecting illegal activities in general. Not necessarily in that order.
This affects **business accounts** even more.
My best guess: Why should a business account need to *buy* Bitcoin? Their main problem should be getting rid of Bitcoin from customers. That might raise a flag.

Some thoughts here:
If you ever use the same phone for 2FA (email, sms, authenticator) and for logging in to Exchanges, that kind of defeats the purpose.
At least make absolutely sure that you do not store your passwords to the Exchange on the browser/app.

Sounds reasonable, but is that deterministic, and documented? Also, mempool-size limit seems to be something that depends on the node, no?
From what I understand: If your transaction does not look like it is going to go through, and you want to be ~100% sure it stays that way, you double spent it with a high fee that makes the second spending attractive for miners, so that the second spending gets &gt;6 confirmations quickly - which will result in the old transaction being rejected with almost absolute certainty. Right?
My originnal question was directed at the reason why someone submits a transaction with a "0-5" satoshi/byte fee in the first place...

That is only advisable for trading. 
For mid- or long time storage, use an offline wallet (free) or a device like the Trezor (~ USD 100).
Online exchanges are not safe. Bad things have happened and will happen again. It is a very new situation, and website operators are very likely to mess stuff up.


Activate 2FA on your email account as well, and preferably do not use SMS.
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:58:49
Ok, lets do that:
* OS?
* OS Update status?
* Which wallet, firmware, driver?
* Browser?
* Browser update status?
* Does it happen with other browsers?
* Can you reproduce/trigger the popup certainly by plugging in the wallet?
General advice, should you suspect something fishy going on:
* Did you make sure you never visited a phishing site?
* Did you make sure your 2FA is not compromised?
* ...same for your email?
* Did you change your passwords?
* Do you have a substantial amount of money in your wallet?

Would not help if the scammer preloads his Java "generator" with a million of addresses, and the app you downloaded and run "offline" just gives you one of them by random.
The scammer then just has to continuously test his repository of addresses.
How would you catch on without inspecting the source code?
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:34:40
There is not much the protocol can do. With a private key being necessary to sign transactions, that's basically it.
Especially there is nothing the protocol can do that does not severely impact speed of transactions.
How would you use BTC for payment (or in general for transfers) if a transaction could be cancelled? It is called "confirmation" for a reason. It is not a security flaw, it is an inherent feature. I am not being sarcastic here.
It all comes down to this:
If the private key is secret and safe, "your BTC assets" are safe.
**The user has to keep his private key secret and safe. There is no way around this fundamental fact."** 
This is not a problem of the BTC protocol.
Even before the widespread availability of hardware tokens there have been publicly available, easy and simple ways to accomplish this. Live-CD, paper wallets, and countless tutorials at your fingertips.

If an Equifax- or Yahoo-sized leak happens to your Exchange, your money is gone. Good luck suing them.

That's too complicated for &gt;99% of users anyway.
My guess is that maybe 50% of bitcoin owners today have heard of the fork, half of them know about replay-vulnerabilities, half of them know how to prevent them in theory, and less than half of those could actually use the 3Bit address "trick".

You missed the point. If a place/vendor/business contact wants cash, and your assets are in coin, you need to cash your coins.
The point here is simple: Leave your assets in bitcoin during your travel, then withdraw to cash at the destination location. As with your bank account.
Or ask the contact to accept bitcoin for the transaction.

That's not the point. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:48:46
Ok, here is what the website says:
What do I need to do to split my coins after the hard fork?
You will want to move your Legacy coins first to new addresses (your Legacy wallet), **but each of these transactions will have to send a small amount to 3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi.** If you don’t care much about privacy, you can make one giant transaction that sends all your current bitcoins to another address or set of addresses. Just make sure a small amount is **also** sent to 3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi in the same transaction.
What they mean is, I have my "BTC/B2X" address after the split, and ONCE send a Satoshi to the 3Bit address, and have the remaining BTC in my return address, while the B2X remain on the original wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:56:04
Ok, so that's just a standard wallet feature, and easily done, usually?

I absolutly disagree with what (I think) you are trying to say.
Bitcoin as a network operates on a cryptographic protocol. There are some places where things might benefit from improvement, but the vast majority of reported losses are not caused by those imperfections, or could have been avoided by the widespread deployment of better "tools".
99% of losses are user failure. Failure to apply basic security rules. That includes having considereable assets on a hacked Exchange, not securing your email account, and falling for a phishing site.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:12:23
The feature is generally called "withdrawal" - you can usually withdraw "your" cryptocurrencies (or unspent fiat) from the Exchange (here: Coinbase) to another account.
That account can be a bank account for fiat, or an Bitcoin address. 
Just create a paper wallet, and withdraw the BTC to your paper wallets public address.
Then you can go to  and enter your PUBLIC KEY, and after a while you can see the incoming transaction to that address, and the confirmations. 
...If you are a beginner, look into how to create Paper Wallets in a safe way! It is simple, but has to be done correctly!
 
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:51:32
About opening the HDD and exposing the platters: Before doing that, be aware that this cannot be done reliably at home, and costs a lot of money. Do the math if that is worth the investment.
Do a visual inspection of the HDD: Any pins broken or bend? Any soldering or IC legs broken? Any IC chipped?
If a drive "clicks", use Google and Youtube for tricks. Maybe the motor or spindle is stuck, or the lubrication is dried up.
Never handle the drives while they are spinning or trying to spin up.
Try warming up the HDD in your lap, try tapping it carefully while disconnected from power.
If it does not even click or make ANY noise, try to find a replacement for the electronics.
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:37:50
To be honest, I do not even get how to "use" that mechanism. 
I am supposed to send a small amount to 3Bit...... Great. How? When? - Every time I make a transaction? Once? To get the rest of the BTC on the address to a return address? That is explained fucking nowhere.
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:34:13




That should be reason enough.

@_date: 2017-10-07 18:29:58


The instructions to prevent replays said to ALSO send a small amount to the 3Bit address when doing a transaction.
So, what I am really am supposed to do is: **PLEASE CORRECT ME**
1. Have my BTC/B2X combined wallet with, say, 1 BTC/B2X on it.
2. Send one BTC Satoshi to *3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi*.
3. Then the rest of the BTC is returned to a return-address, and that's all not replayed on the B2X chain.
4. Then I have my B2X on the originial wallet, and the BTC on the return-address?
That's complicated enough...
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:23:55
Not true for Euro notes.
People and vendors do not have to accept those. 
The national banks or ECB does not replace intentionally damaged (including inscribed) bills.
So, in theory, it loses its value. Everyone usually accepts them, so that's kind of a moot point.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:19:11


I would say I am somewhat familiar with how Blockchains work, and have decent general understanding of Computer Science.
I still have no fucking clue what to do, or understand this free-money/no-free-money thing completely.
If I make use of the opt-in replay protection explained here:
... I can send my BTC to another address, and keep the B2X on the original address, right?
Can I make a single transaction that sends different amounts to the target and the 3Bit address at the same time? Is that a feature?

If you can prove you made the transaction, and did not "owe" Shapeshift.io that amount, do they not have a legal obligation to return that money at some point?
To clarify: I mean if it was the Exchanges "own" wallet, not one they only have in custody for one of their customers. If it ended up with one of their customers, that's going to be a WAY more difficult issue, I bet.
I doubt they will keep it, when you have prove what happened, and it ended up with them,
Definitely get in contact with their support, ask for the issue to be escalated immediately.

Just hit EURO 5500!
We Europeans have the same feeling about nice EUR numbers like you guys have with USD :-).

Read carefully what each command line tool does. Read your commands twice before hitting enter.
When you have to mount your HDD, do it READ ONLY, always.
Use dd to create an image of the HDD contents on another disk.
Verify the image can be mounted, and you see contents.
If you use dd the wrong way, you WILL FUCK UP YOUR HDD.
Power down, disconnect the HDD.
Power up, mount the image.
If that works, you do not really need forensic tools, you can browse the file structure manually.
Try to recover your private/public keys ~~and PM me :-).~~
Good luck!

On the other hand, banks have compliance departments that review all transactions that are a) filtered automatically or b) flagged by any teller, customer service representative or manager manually.
And they rely on a set of rules - I doubt sending money to a BTC exchange a couple of times is regulated by itself.
Maybe you were sending larger sums than usual, or to a company that is already flagged internally for other reasons, or flagged by an external company feeding compliance rules into the banks set of rules.
Applying Hanlon's razor here... I think they did not ban you because they inherently dislike bitcoin or feel threatened. It is likely they were just trying to be compliant. 


You are probably right. But compliance rules include not telling the customer why exactly their transaction got flagged. If you send money to accounts related to terrorism, they will flag and block that, but will not tell you why exactly (AFAIK).

You do not have BTC, coinbase has them.
If you want to keep them for a long time and not use them to buy/sell stuff: Create a paper wallet (READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. It is very easy, but has some dangers. All is explained well. Have no fear.)
Have Coinbase transfer all your BTC to the public address on the paper wallet.
NEVER show/give someone the private key. That's like losing your wallet. That's only needed for withdrawals.
If you want to empty your paper wallet, withdraw the FULL amount, not parts. Bad things will happen otherwise. Again: It's easy and simple, but has its dangers.

And when it breaks ~USD 5900, that's EUR 5000, a psychological milestone here in Europe.

I think that law is does not apply to corporations as much as to single person behaviour...

Wow, there are hardware wallets for USD 275?!
