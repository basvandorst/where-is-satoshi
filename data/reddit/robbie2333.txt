There's an interesting theory behind this headline. It's speculative on my part, but hear me out and see what you think. In late 2014, when a bitcoin was still worth way in excess of $300, I estimated that $225 was the minimum price for mining to be economically viable. Since then, the price has fallen and has remained in this range since mid-January 2015.
In the meantime, the amount of early-stage investment going into Bitcoin has more than tripled--$344 million YTD compared to $103 million for the same period in 2014 (source: CoinDesk).
In late 2014, a prominent Bitcoin miner who had earlier in the year raised $20 million announced that they had raised an additional $20 million to fund operations and projects. I didn't understand the announcement at the time, but it stuck in the back of mind. In January 2015, a big retail cloud mining operation (who I suspect is closely aligned with the prominent miner, above) announced they would "pause" mining operations. The price was around $300 at this time.
In hindsight, I wonder how these people knew the price would not recover. And all the seed and VC money coming in--where were all these funds being deployed?
So, it comes back to $225. At this price, all miners commissioned prior to late-2014 are loss making (except those that get free electricity). That's more than 250 PHash of processing power made obsolete and replaced with new-generation miners. At today's hash rate of 325 PHash, I estimate around 300 PHash is new hardware deployed since late 2014. At $600/THash, this is worth around $180 million.
If I take this question further, what kind of investor goes into mining to break even. That is, sell all the mined bitcoins to recover operating costs, leaving zero profit? Aren't these guys supposed to the the "smart money?"
Now, think back to the prominent miner (and many like him). In today's context, when they raised additional capital to "fund operations," they knew the price would come down. That money is allowing them to pay the bills while retaining bitcoins.
Due to shallow trading volumes, big investors have decided that mining is the best way to acquire large amounts of coin. And in order to bag the biggest share of the mining reward, by eliminating most of the older (amatuer) miners, they use their funds to manage bitcoin supply and depress prices.
What this means is that some very important and rich groups are vying to acquire as many coins as possible. Could this be an indication to some sort of future for Bitcoin? Does it mean those holding bitcoin will also benefit from these long-term trends?
There are two risks to this strategy:
1) Bitcoin flops and disappears from the face of the Earth. Having the smart money onside has its benefits.
2) Bitcoin takes off too early. Organic demand grows, pushing the price up. Those holding coins now will benefit most. Large miners also experience upside from price appreciation, but high price brings in more new entrants, diluting the mining reward.

Interested in your thoughts...
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:28:51
Sorry about that.
1) ATO: Australian Tax Office (equivalent to the US IRS)
2) GST: Goods and services tax. Also known as value-added tax or sales tax
Short story: ATO wants users to pay GST on acquiring BTC and again for using it to buy things. Hope that helped.

Are you asking in the capacity of an individual or a business? Either way, ATO guidance on such transactions is available here:
@_date: 2014-12-14 05:31:54
That's a seriously good read, thanks. However, I don't think you are implying the same authour was responsible for both articles.
The real culprit of inflation is fractional reserved banking. That's probably what you were getting at by "bank debt money," but that's just a guess.
In a crazy scenario where, say, we were all forced to put bitcoins in banks, cryptocurrencies would work the same way on inflation as fiat. People in ancient times understood this well when money lenders created crazy inflation by doing the same with gold.
The missing piece in this picture is that Bitcoin prevents the US Federal Reserve from creating money to finance bonds. Bitcoin takes direct creation out of regulators' hands, but it is only one part of the problem that Bitcoin solves.

The cost per terahash is down to about USD 500 using ASIC miners. Be wary of cloud mining service providers who can't tell you what their cost structure looks like. Please, look through my Bitcoin mining guide before parting with any money. Good luck!

Using a debit card does't protect your privacy if the payment is routed through their payments network. In Australia, chose EFTPOS for POS purchases. However, all online card transactions go through Visa/MasterCard, unfortunately.

"We will have 5 -7 Peta Hash in a short amount of time with 70+ MW of mining online by the end of Q4 in 2015"
Something is not right about this claim. Can 7 Petahash consume 70 MW of electricity? Is it possible to reveal how much power your system uses on a per terahash basis, hosting fees and acquisition price? Cheers!
@_date: 2014-12-19 11:03:20
My understanding of the problem is that consumers pay GST (VAT) to buy BTC and again on spending it.
The issue with merchants is that they will need to pay GST to convert the BTC back to fiat. This would normally be OK if they could claim an 'input credit,' but in reality, this complication negatively impacts operating cash flow compared to accepting cash (perhaps debit, credit, etc.) that don't attract GST.
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:32:04
We'll need an expert on this topic. A quick check on Officeworks shows that the $500 gift card does not apply GST though.
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:34:05
Is barter a big part of your economy? I think the point is that Bitcoin is more like money than barter and it is thus unfair to treat it as such. Burdening Bitcoin with taxes effectively relegates it to the fringe, protecting incumbents from competition.

This completely misses the reason for having a SIM card in the first place, which is to allow subscribers to carry their account across different phones and (sometimes) networks. This is especially useful for those who travel frequently, but equally applies to those who change handsets on a regular basis.
Now, storing Bitcoin wallets on the SIM card... that would be a real innovation! ;)
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:22:18
You are, of course, correct from a user perspective. Transmitting funds might get expensive if all exchanges were domiciled abroad, but your point is well taken.
I was addressing the issue from the perspective of a local startup. The ATO's decision appears to be lunacy because they are knowingly destroying economic value and opportunities for the country. I don't understand it, TBH.
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:07:06
The nature of startups and innovation is that they have the potential to return stellar profits. Even so on a risk-adjusted basis, which is why there exists a huge market for venture capital and early-stage capital elsewhere in the world. This dynamic is appallingly lacking in Australia because it has simply proven to be not a worthwhile endeavour. I do take your point that Australia is a small market, but I also contend that the way Australia is run, and the average person's acceptance (and reliance) on government meddling actually hurts new ideas and benefits the establishment. Regulators simply don't give new technologies (such as Bitcoin) enough freedom to succeed before suffocating them; and this is just fine by the average person.
@_date: 2014-12-08 12:58:23
I agree with the sentiment, but under some circumstances, there is still enough time to mine more bitcoins that you can buy. The caveat is that prospective miners need to weigh the risks before parting with any money. Check out my short Bitcoin mining guide. Cheers!

"Bank debt money?" No offense, but that read like an ad. Clearly, the author should have better developed his ideas before trying to tackle such a complicated topic.

No probs. You're probably off track with the overlay idea though. Read up on SIM Toolkit if you are interested. It lets you install applets in the SIM card that can securely manage data such as Bitcoin wallets. It's also transportable, which means you can take it out and easily put it in another phone. Cheers and have a good holiday!

Go back to the article you shared. See the chart on inflation/deflation that covers the years 1800--1900? The US Fed was created in 1913. Prior to that, the USA was essentially on a silver/gold standard. Each currency note was backed by a guaranteed amount of physical asset deposited at the bank. If we discount net capital inflows for a while, how do you explain the inflation/deflation cycles?
My point is, Bitcoin does not solve this part of the issue. In fact, if you check out Bitfinex (a HK-based BTC exchange), you will clearly see that Bitcoin credit is an important component of their business. Although, as a broker--not a bank--BitFinex is not in the priveledged position of creating BTC. They are likely not alone in this activity as "leverage" is often mentioned by active traders on this board.
Fractional reserve is the method used by banks to create credit. It's an accounting trick that makes the books balanced while earning banks outsized profits. Unless people manage their own bitcoins, it is not immune to inflation if Bitcoin banks are allowed to follow the fractional reserve system.
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:06:27
Please, take a quick look through my Bitcoin mining guide before parting with your money. $100 for 200 GH/s is about right, but you also need to know how energy efficient their cloud is, the cost of their electricity and hosting/management fees involved. Take care.

The linked document was submitted to the Australian Senate Inquiry on Digital Currency. So, it's pretty important because the country's Bitcoin roadmap could be influenced by lies and misinformation from high flying shit stirrers.
Breaking their argument apart in a public forum helps prepare us for more BS to come. It will allow us to challenge nonsensical statements they make at the hearing that is taking place in early 2015.

At the current hash rate, the true cost is about USD 750K in electricity each day. That's enough to power more than half of NYC or one quarter million US homes.

A slim SIM is effectively placing probes on the signalling contacts to spy on the communication between the SIM and mobile. This trick is not new, and not that sophisticated of an attack.

@_date: 2014-12-07 15:22:57
No. As a product of supply and demand with a fixed supply, bitcoin price will fluctuate to reflect not only this, but also the differences across divergent markets. However, we can expect volatility to decrease over time as adoption improves, bitcoin use becomes diversified and value increases.

I agree, whinging is a national pastime, but isn't that just a passive aggressive appeal to authority?
Government "helping" tech startups is exactly what I'm talking about. That explains why thousands of engineering students graduate each year to multiple job offers and a chance to impact the world--or not.
Australia does have a glut of capital. Did you know our superannuation assets exceed $1.5 trillion dollars? The financial services sector including banks, fund managers and superannuation-related companies is the largest component of the S&amp;P now that mining has declined. How is that a lack of funds?
From my experience, Australian managers are naturally conservative because that's what has proven to work in the long run. Not only are local fund managers averse to startups, but those that aren't often complain about being outbidded by overseas investors in early-stage investments.
@_date: 2014-12-16 06:11:52
The previous reply was good. I'm not a lawyer, but it would make sense that KYC applies to businesses. As you are selling in a private capacity, just follow the ATO guidance on tax and you should be fine. There is no requirement for individuals to apply anti money laundering rules on legitimate trades that I know of.

BTW, anyone here use BitFury cloud mining (cex.io)? Mind sharing how much they pay out per terahash? Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:28:21
It certainly is possible to mine more bitcoins than you can buy. But, as the OP says, cloud mining is replete with shady actors who are out to take you for a ride. Look through my informal Bitcoin mining guide. If the cloud miner can't give you returns or prices in the prescribed range, be careful. If they offer you better terms, run for the hills! haha...
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:15:30
IMHO, the problem with Australia is that it was founded as a penal colony with that DNA deeply engrained in the national psyche. People want to be told what to do, what not to do. Dobbing on an outsider is tolerated, even honourable, and appealing to authourity is second nature. The most destructive result of this attitude on the development of innovation is that new ideas are considered threats that must be broken. Convicts must be equal with no one being allowed to excel outside a narrowly defined arena.
You do make a good point about capital limitations due to our small economy, but the root cause for investors and businesses being highly risk averse leads back to my original point about excessive regulation and goverment micromanagement. The smart money learned a long time ago that it's not worth taking risks because the government will nearly always put you out of business.
@_date: 2014-12-07 15:11:07
They're just playing with semantics--transaction processing is just another name for mining. BitFury is a Bitcoin mining business because it designs ASICs for mining, sells miners (or hashing power) and hosts it's own data centres for mining. The majority of its revenue comes from direct bitcoin mining and selling cloud mining to customers. How is it not a mining company?
BTW, I wonder how that 0.2 J/GH chip is coming along haha... Did they manage to get the 0.7 J/GH system out the door, yet?
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:40:15
Seems like a great deal at $408/TH as long as postage and PSU don't exceed $100.
Couldn't help but notice 0.34 W/GHs power consumption! That's half of what my new system draws at the wall--0.7 W/GHs. If true, it's a definite buy.
I know you have solar and consider that electricity free, but how much would you get selling it back to the grid? That's your real cost.
Assuming 10 cents electricity, this system would easily break even in 6 to 7 months. Please, keep us updated. Cheers!

Hah... in hindsight anything is possible. Really feel bad about your 33k, man. That's like a year of savings for many people.

I reckon there is still enough time to make a decent return, but the odds are really stacked against the average guy if he's still new to mining.

@_date: 2014-12-07 16:43:55
Read my primer before spending money on cloud mining. Only buy if they can match the pricing and returns shown. Although, there is a chance you can mine more bitcoins than you can buy, there are certainly risks you should understand before making up your mind.

Just found a review on the SP20. It actually uses twice as much power as indicated on their website. Someone at Spoondoolies should update that.

As long as transactions are settled immediately and the exchange doesn't take custodial ownership of the client's money, it falls outside of ASIC's scope.
Conversely, note that Bitcoin derivatives are considered financial products that may be regulated by ASIC.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:12:02
Just to clarify, I reckon the OP is confusing the price of each transaction with the cost. The total cost is the amount of electricity consumed in mining, which is independent of transaction count. The biggest determinants are hash rate and the cost of electricity.
@_date: 2014-12-19 12:52:19
Simly buy bitcoins on exchanges that provide the best rates factoring in commissions, money transfer fees and GST.
Now, to get the most out of your bitcoins, shop at places that offer the best price also taking into account discounts, GST, shipping, security and service level.
Being on the Internet means consumers have the freedom to shop around and compare. In this context, Bitcoin offers the potential to compete with traditional payment processors by reducing cross-border transaction costs.

Just as I predicted 2 weeks ago. But, rather than expect them to completely go offline, chances are only the older hardware will be shut down unless BTC price breaks $300-ish again. Of course, that belongs to cloud miners... they probably are running the new miners for themselves, unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:36:16
It's not a ponzi scheme, just a bad investment for those who bought into cloud mining. The only thing that can save them is if price increases. Cloud miners are generally better off simply acquiring bitcoin, IMHO.
As for cex.io, I'm estimating most of their cloud is actually a mixture of first and second generation miners consuming upwards of 1kWh/TH. Even with super cheap electricity, their breakeven price is about $300 at the current hash rate. They literally can not afford to run the cloud at today's low prices.

Remember when Bitfury raised $20 million this year and then raised an additional $20 to fund operations and research? To me, that meant they couldn't sell enough to pay the running costs without crashing Bitcoin. It also means that Bitfury investors doubled down--they are long Bitcoin all the way.
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:35:09
In short, what you're saying is that cloud miners are paying good money for old hardware.
Unless vendor tells you exactly what the expected energy efficiency is, you have no way to estimate the running costs.
I remember reading about a prominent Bitcoin company that began mining in early-mid 2014. They broke even in about four months and reported that they were selling obsolete hardware to cloud miners.
I had estimated that they were paying 9-10 cents per kWh, so if they weren't able to squeeze a profit out, I have no idea who would.
The take-away is that if they won't tell you the operating costs, don't give them your money.

@_date: 2015-01-04 14:24:24
Close, but I reckon your figure is a little low. Also, aggregated electricity cost is decided by hash rate, not the amount of coins awarded.
Here are my assumptions:
     1) Hash rate = 320,000 TH/s
     2) Global weighted average electricity price = $0.10/kWh
     3) Global weighted average energy efficiency = 0.8kW/TH/s
     4) BTC price = $290
     Calculation: 2,119 BTC per day = (320,000 TH/s x $0.10/kWh x 0.8kW/TH/s x 24hr) / $290
This is the equivalent $614,400 in electricity each day.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:20:55
Parts of the USA, Canada and oil-rich middle eastern countries also offer competitively-priced electricity. Miners are purportedly paying under 10 cents in out-of-the-way places like Iceland. Certainly comparable, if not cheaper, than commercial rates in China.
Some Bitcoiners will mine for the principle, although I do concede that they represent a small fraction of overall hashing power.
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:55:18
Interesting how you figured $192. By my calculations, when BTC dips below $225-$250, most miners become unprofitable. If it stays low for more than a month, some miners will just go away rather than pay rent/hosting to have their miners sitting idle. If this situation occurs, hash rate will decline, offset by the commissioning of new miners already in the pipeline.

The guys have created this Bitcoin ETF for two reasons:
1) Legacy building
2) Exit strategy. There isn't enough liquidity in the regular exchanges for them to offload all their BTC. What are the odds the twins will be supplying all underlying for the ETF? haha...
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:59:45
Thanks for the link. Is that your personal blog? It's a good read.






Isn't it the case that the Fed is simply creating money out of nowhere to buy treasuries? Part of this might be providing liquidity to secondary markets, but my suspicion is that much of this money directly finances the government. That is, an institution with unlimited capacity to create money is financing one with a limitless ability to spend it.






If we take this observation further by zooming out:
It is apparent that the rate of currency growth accelerates after 2008 (Value of currency in circulation). This period includes the dot-com bubble of the late 90s, and post-9/11 low interest rates for comparison.
If you look further down the page (Calendar-year print order), in 2012 (the year of the Bernanke presentation) and 2013, they PRINTED more than $720 billion worth of notes. That's nearly $350 billion more than normal.
Given these data points, Bernanke's statements have clearly been shown to be incomplete:
1) The loans were fully collateralized--Unproven. Some might suggest the Fed overpaid. I reckon the only way they will be able to redeem on maturity is if these two things happen:
  (a) Inflation sufficiently erodes the relative buying power of the the MBS's face value
  (b) Another housing bubble is timed to coincide with the maturity date of these MBSs
It would be disappointing if they announced break even (or profit) on this day and the news gets plastered all over headlines, which they will.
2) The asset purchases generated $200 billion in profit, that went back to the treasury to reduce government debt--Twisted logic. $200 billion represents a 10% return. When split over 3--4 years, it is equal to no more than a 3% yield. At the time these MBSs were originated, the Fed rate was 4%--5%, so one would expect these MBSs to do better. Unless the Fed overpaid, or the assets are underperforming. In this case, it can be argued that the Fed made a loss instead of a profit.
Further, the fact that "profits" were paid back to the Treasury to 'reduce [government] debt' makes no sense. It goes back to my point about the Fed indirectly making money because the government wouldn't have this money to spend in the first place if the Fed didn't create capital to buy the assets with. Here, they indirectly created $200 billion that went straight into the economy. This offsets the bank reserves held at the Fed that are claimed to be mere accounting artifacts.
3) The bailout did not contribute to inflation because bank reserves are simply numbers on a computer system--history has shown that currency in circulation did indeed grow at an accelerated rate contributing to inflation all over the world. Notably, the prices of commodities, food staples and real estate were a growing concern early this decade.
Overall, Bernanke did a good job given the circumstances. I accept the information may have been provided in good faith, but history has shown that reality is not so simple.

@_date: 2015-04-20 19:08:19
On a related note, see how Ben Bernanke, in 2012, explain how the Federal Reserve "is not printing money."
Not very convincing I might add:
@_date: 2015-04-21 07:18:02
It was pretty amazing all the topics Bernanke covered in four lectures, and nicely done too. This is the type of transparency people need more of to be better informed.
I've only got a few issues with his presentation, the important one being the claim that the Fed was not printing money, which is technically correct, but against the spirit of the meaning, in my view.
On this topic, Bernanke stated that money was not PRINTED, but was instead CREATED out of thin air and kept out of circulation by residing in reserve accounts held with the Fed. As proof, he points to the light-blue region in the graph that represents the amount of federal reserve notes in circulation. His commentary was that the money supply remained flat, but if I were to be pedantic, I could argue that the line appears to change trajectory in 2008, where it does indeed get steeper. Surely, something else must be going on if we are to take his words at face value.
As backup, he shows a graph of the Fed's assets and liabilities. He implies the fact that they balance means no money was created. Again, this is wrong. It is merely an accounting metric that tests for solvency and doesn't explain how the additional 2 trillion dollars was created to buy distressed bank assets.
Although they can claim that they did not literally print money, they did however create money directly; and indirectly by overpaying for bad assets, which were still on the Fed's balance sheet at the time of the lectures in 2012.
Think about it like this:
A mortgage backed asset is created in 2004 and sold to investors for $1. But, let's say it's only really worth 80 cents because the AAA rating is bogus. A sizable portion of the mortgages mixed in there are bad. By 2007, this asset might have a market value of $1.05 because the market was heated up.
In a correction, the price would have adjusted downwards closer to 80 cents. In a crash, the price would be lower. When the Fed steps in to buy this asset for $1.05, it has locked in between 5 and 25 cents of value creation--something that otherwise would not exist at this point in 2008. This doesn't solve the problem that the underlying asset is only worth 80 cents, and that the Fed will have to sell it back for $1.05 to break even on the principal one day.
An important question here is that if the assets were worth what the Fed paid, why did they buy them in the first place? If they had remained on bank balance sheets, everything would have worked out just fine, right?
To put it another way, what difference does swapping $1 worth of assets for $1 worth of Fed dollars make to bank solvency? Moreover, if the Fed loan was not real money, just a number in a computer system, how does that improve the bank's liquidity?
Just thinking out aloud.

Only time will tell if those MBSs are any good.
As of last week, Fed release shows $1.7 trillion of them still on Fed balance sheets--not much improvement since 2012:
Also intetesting, if I'm reading it right, is that assets have grown 50% since 2012 with most of the difference coming from the purchase of US Treasury notes and bonds.
Even more interesting is that currency in circulation has reached $1.36 trillion dollars. Approximately 50% above 2008 levels if we compare to the light blue area from the Bernanke presentation. If they didn't print it, where did all that new currency come from?

Point is the originating and destination addresses in the SMS header are plain text and easily forged.

I really like the idea, but have some reservations about the business model and some of the technicalities.
Firstly, isn't it the case that the BitSIM model is predicated on the assumption that the world's underbanked don't have access to 3G/4G/WiFi and Android; or that the situation won't improve anytime soon? I think BitSIM could benefit from really exploring this underlying assumption further.
Secondly, the Java Card SIM overlay is probably something that's been around for more than 10 years. The BitSIM website doesn't offer much details, but from what I can gather, they've likely hacked together a bunch of STK services (SMS-PP Data Download (alternatively, SELECT/READ RECORD EFSMS); SEND SHORT MESSAGE, SETUP MENU, etc.) to deliver a simple menu-based service that runs off SMS-SUBMIT and SMS-DELIVER, with security provided at the application level, and server-side integration to the bitcoin network.
That's an okay hack, but here are a few issues that concern me:
1) The SMS service is unsecured and delivery is not guaranteed. Messages are sent between the phone and the SMS Service Centre in plain text, so altering message content, originating and destination addresses is trivial. I hope these addresses are not being used as some form of user id.
2) The reliance on SMS potentially opens all users up to denial-of-service attacks where the telco can simply block messages to BitSIM gateways. If this happens, or if BitSIM went out of business, many people would not know how to recover their bitcoins.
3) Since the SMS channel is not encrypted, the BitSIM applet might need to provide this functionality. Moreover, signing bitcoin transactions means secret keys are definitely stored in the BitSIM overlay/SIM card system. If I remember correctly, Java Card does not define a file system, so most applications rely on the UICC file structure in the SIM card. Many of these files can be simply read without much restriction. If BitSIM were able to put their own file in there, to store secret keys, they would be relying entirely on that implementation of the file system. Reputable manufacturers follow all the security guidelines, but a sub-$1 SIM card from a low-cost manufacturer would likely be easy to hack. Further, transferring secret keys off the SIM card to the BitSIM overlay for cryptographic operations is susceptible to probing, which allows an attacker to view the communications between two systems.
4) Even though reputable SIM card manufacturers follow very strict security guidelines--for example, uninitialised cards are stored in a secured vault where the glass on the security window alone is almost half a foot thick to prevent hijacking, and other things--it was recently reported that the NSA had hacked Gemalto (the largest manufacturer in the world) and compromise batch keys that secure mobile voice traffic. I wouldn't want to store my bitcoin keys in there knowing this were the case.
5) Assuming I trust BitSIM enough to let their applet manage my bitcoins, I would also want my secret keys safely backed up somewhere. The BitSIM overlay is a little chip embedded on a plastic sheet that is easily damaged, or lost.
Overall, I am excited by what this BitSIM development promises and the potential that it holds to bring financial services to countless underprivileged people in the world. The ability to simply buy and sell things, in a wider market, can not be underestimated in its ability to improve lives.

Bitcoin transfer requests to the bitcoin network being signed are ok via SMS, but any other communication would be difficult to secure.
Both these scenarios bring us to point 3, regarding the storage of secret and private keys. In the BitSIM scheme, a lot of effort will need to go into guarding the storage and transmission of keys because the underlying framework is likely to be lacking.

I estimated more than three months ago that in the $225-$250 price range, Bitcoin hash rate could possibly drop below 200 PH--offset by new hardware deployments. At the time, BTC was $290 and hash rate was 320 PH/s.
Today, the price is $237 and hash rate just dropped to 290 PH this morning.
From a mining perspective, current generation miners have a gross margin exceeding 50% at present. The average old miner is barely trudging along. Please, note that although new miners are operationally profitable, this does not account for the cost of capital. In everyday speak, it means they make enough to pay for salaries and electricity, but the payback time for hardware and setup costs still stretches into the future.
With the next halving, which is little more than one year away, and at the current price and hash levels, most miners become unprofitable. Older-generation miners will be hit hardest--I'm estimating that's worth up to 200 PH of hashing power. While new miners can break even at best.
As old miners drop out, the better capitalized operators will be able to hold on until the hash rate drops to around 180 PH, where they are again breaking even. At this point current generation miners are making around 30% gross margin, but getting a good return on capital is looking bleak. This in turn stifles the amount of investment going into R&amp;D to develop faster, more energy-efficient chips.
A 30% gross margin is still decent, so new entrants may come, pushing the hash rate north of 180 PH/s.
This scenario is based on constant price and technology assumptions. If bitcoin price were to materially appreciate, the hash rate would also increase. If ASICs suddenly became more energy efficient, the overall hash rate would be higher.
With the reported amount of investments going into Bitcoin these days, I'm not convinced that the hash rate wouldn't just keep climbing over the medium term due to the flood of money coming on board. In this scenario, the hash rate could reach 500 PH/s, with diminished profits even for the best operator.
Another variable to consider is price. If miners are expecting bitcoins to be worth thousands of dollars down the line, big players are able to keep mining at an initial loss to accumulate bitcoins. As an aside, the Bitcoin market being notoriously shallow makes it too easy for them to manipulate. They could depress the price for a few months to force out small players and discourage others from entering, or pump and dump to create volatility that scares people away.
IMHO, in the end, it's mostly about who has the most capital. Even so, having all the coins, or a $10,000 price, is only paper profit if there is insufficient real demand to sustain volumes at that price.

A 0.2% cap on debit card transactions absolutely makes sense because it is the consumer's money afterall. But, a 0.3% cap on CREDIT cards is crazy because delinquent loans will likely wipe out all profits and more. I'm assuming the cap is inclusive of interchange, processing and all other fees.
Banks will likely respond in two ways:
1) Revoke millions of credit cards on the premise that certain customers represent a credit risk, or
2) Increase fees elsewhere to subsidize the CC business
Another possibility is that banks and CC companies will pile money into lobbying for better terms.
Can Bitcoin beat 0.2%--not likely. Bid-ask spread, trading fees and volatility risk exceed this amount by my estimations. But, that's Europe. In the US, I would expect to see CC fees decline markedly over time thanks to Bitcoin. When this happens, Bitcoin would have achieved its primary goal of bringing efficiency to financial transactions markets.

You might be surprised that legit commercial electricity is not that cheap in China. I'd say it's only slightly cheaper than average US tariffs, and materially more than Washington and Georgia prices. There was a large operation running out of Iceland that was averaging 12 cents, but got it down to 9 cents at their second facility.
Based on volatility in the hashrate as of January, I suspect many of the early-generation miners have been replaced by 3rd/4th generation hardware. If I remember correctly, the price was hovering around the low-to-mid-$200 range for nearly a month. At that price, and at the current $300 level, miners are simply better off powering down and buying bitcoins with the electricity savings if they haven't upgraded. Since that didn't happen--the price didn't stay low long enough--and based on dramatic hashrate swings, I'd say you are correct on the second point.

That was perfect! Well done, Andreas.

Sure there's a difference. As a consumer, using the debit card reduces your bank account right away. But, using a credit card leaves that money in your pocket for a few extra weeks.
Would you let someone else spend your hard earned dollars for free? Either would a bank because they have to answer to depositors and shareholders. If instead of letting you use it, they left it in the vault, interest would accrue, which is their opportunity cost for lending to you. Part of the premium is compensation for this loss.
I take your point about APR, but imagine in the worst case scenario that all delinquent loans never get paid back. No matter the APR, the bank would never be able to collect. That's why part of this risk is built into the 0.3% processing fee.

Bondholders got shafted seriously. Anyone who had GM bonds in their retirement portfolio unfairly lost the majority of that money.
Under normal bankruptcy proceedings, they would have ranked behind banks, but in front of trade creditors, shareholders and workers to be paid out from funds derived through liquidation.
Instead, the prevailing cronies worked out a sweetheart deal that paid union workers instead. In normal circumstance, everything about this would be illegal.

With debit cards, that's your money that is immediately deducted from your account. Credit cards are different because someone else is essentially lending you money until you settle the bill at the end of the month. A part of the premium belongs to whoever financed you, as well as for credit risk.
If you do pay the credit card bills on time, then there are no other financing costs. In this case, the interest on outstanding loans don't apply, or you pay 0% APR.
Now, the 15-25% APR quoted, is used to offset loss from bad and delinquent loans. I'm not arguing if this rate is fair, just explaining the fundamental difference between debit and credit cards. Thus, that is why different rates apply.

The majority part of merchant fees (in most countries) is actually paid back to issuing banks. The remainder is shared between processors and the credit card company for facilitating transactions. My understanding is that CC companies don't make any money from APRs; that's the issuing bank's domain.

Probably more than 3 trillion if you count all TARP and related programs, but many of the financial institutions paid back their loans, so a better question would be what did the Fed do with the money that was paid back?
If they destroyed it--afterall, it was created out of thin air (Bernanke was very candid about this point in his GWU College Lecture Series talk in 2012)--the long-term effect is limited to the money that was created to service that debt. Otherwise, if they passed those funds to the Treasury, all that money is floating around in the real economy because the government spent it, creating inflation.
Under TARP, the Fed was also creating money, giving it to financial institutions, so that banks could buy government debt instruments. Either new issues or to acquire expiring bonds as they came due--"rolling over" debt. Put simply, the Fed made money to lend to itself, and to the government through the Treasury by extension. Bankers kept the interest paid on the bonds, less what they owed the Fed for the loans (which was probably 0%).
As you can see, banks were given a free lunch; the government got all the funds it wanted to "stimulate the economy" and prevent a financial meltdown; bad assets and debt were transferred/added to the public account; and financial institutions got a free bailout courtesy of taxpayers. If we also ignore the small amounts of money created by the Fed to service these debts, the whole scheme works out pretty well on the basis that the Fed vanquish all funds they got back that were created out of thin air. This is yet to be answered.
Anyone know?

This is more related to capital control than anything else. If you are a bitcoiner, you should not be bitching about HSBC.
Let me explain: When Obama came into power, his administration strong armed Toyota, Honda, RBS, HSBC and a string of other companies. Go Google it. Rarely did a month go by without a major product recall or scandal driven by his appointed Czars. The common thread is they were nearly all successful, foreign companies operating in the US. Although most wrote it off as a cost of doing business, this fact did not go unnoticed, and it will not be forgotten.
HSBC operated not unlike most other banks of the time resulting in a nearly 2 billion dollar settlement with DOJ. Due to this, the entire commercial banking environment in HK is changed. In what was once the freest economy in the world, it is now nearly impossible to open a new business bank account. If you are American, no bank will touch you anywhere in the world.
This is part of a grander scheme to control how we make, store and spend our money. The war on cash. Like it or not, Bitcoin is on that hit list, so if I were you, I would be very worried about what my government has in store instead of bitching about HSBC this and that.
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:01:56
That was kinda my point. As an outsider, HSBC is not in the bankster clique. They had barely started opening branches in the US and were already in the process of pulling out. They were an easy target and a good excuse to stifle free economies and further extend statist domination throughout the world. It makes no sense to cheer that on.
