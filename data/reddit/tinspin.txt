But how can you recover them then? If they are locked up, so only when one has recovered can the other one recover? It's a timer I guess? Still not very elegant, 3rd party escrow still makes sense... select two: fast, secure and trusted.

Ok, so what do you call that part of a pyramid scheme? Early adopter advantage?
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:12:58
Well if you mined 0.7 bitcoin per day with 40W back in the FPGA glory days; that's similar to being on top *in retrospect*! Today you mine like 0.0008 bitcoin per day with 40W, that's x1000. You could call that an involuntary hierarchy.

I think the banks are in a squeeze, they know the fiat/debt system is broken and they are starting to understand that bitcoin is not. So they are trying; blockchain here, bitcoin there to make amends. In contrast to bittorrent, bitcoin is not used by majority to do illegal things, bitcoin is moral, even though it has an early adopter advantage and can be used for evil, as all things.
They realize we need bitcoin, but they can't take the risk yet (bitcoin can't be acquired by companies and held from a tax point of view, and the Swedish IRS has no way out of this except from allowing for taxes to be paid in bitcoin!). So the banks only have 2 options; buy bitcoin mining hardware (not a good idea yet, they are waiting for 16nm atleast) or trying to make consumers (their customers) get in before it's too late = this article!
Basically they want a bailout by bitcoin? Because when the system fails, if peoples money gets bailed in, which they are working hard to put in place; banksters will not have a pleasant day to put it mildly

This is good, the banks are paying to promote bitcoin, the article is only negative if you choose to see it that way. This kind of article would have been unimaginable only a year ago.
To say that a currency needs to be stable is like saying the blockchain is good but not bitcoin. It's not bitcoin that is volatile; it's the legacy system that is crumbling. The only thing stable is debt, until it isn't.
We're in a deflationary spiral, the banks, companies and governments are out of ammunition (negative interest rate); next will be collapse of the debt, then hyperinflation.
Sweden has one of the highest debts in the world (private and corporate debt) and the consequences for SEB and other Swedish banks will be serious.

To block/pause bitcoin you have to shut down the internet because you can always encrypt and proxy your way through any limitation.
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:02:06
Exactly, bitcoin is explicitly and inherently deflationary, like nature. Fiat debt is artificial and inflationary but obviously not stronger than nature. Debt is deflationary in it's destruction, deflation in debt is bad, deflation in an asset is good. It's complicated but after the events will pass we will both understand exactly what deflation is, ask someone who lived in the 1920's.
Fiat debt only works as long as you have expansion (the romans conquered, we exploited nature and exploded the population). We have consumed millions of years of sunlight stored by plants (photosyntesis binds carbon from the air to water and frees oxygen, creating what eventually becomes coal, oil and gas) during 200 years  without even thinking about the long term consequences. It's payback time.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:46:37
Pyramid scheme is the same as early birds advantage. Early miners have all the incitement to add more greater fools to the bitcoin market in order to increase the value of their coins.

The amount of **open** nodes are going down. But I'm pretty sure the number of firewalled nodes is exponential. Why expose your bitcoind to external attacks by opening the port? Who would run a bitcoind without funds? Does the blockchain have value without bitcoin? Well you got your answers all there!
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:14:05
Yeah, I trust that like I trusted MtGox or any other non-human counterpart. The only way to use bitcoin is with **one** physical human responsible for the funds and preferably that human is you. That way you know stuff gets done right. Putting a key-holder person with impeccable track record in the cross-hair might be good?
Who has access to these wallets? How are they stored? Where do they get filled up from? How do they get filled up? How and where do they get tapped out!?
Derivatives just like fiat and debt are not really compatible with bitcoin because they rely on trust and inifinite supply, and bitcoin is trustless and finite (open for misinterpretation, but the tech-savvy will know what I mean).
Otherwise I'm sure history will repeat itself soon: 3, 2, 1... somebody hacked the GBTC wallets! = some insider took the wallet and ~~ran away~~ didn't even have to run away (just wait until people forgot about their stolen bitcoins).
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:37:05
The poll speaks clearly for a dynamic block size. The real challenge is to finish pruning without security issues.
@_date: 2015-05-01 21:40:49
I agree, bitcoin is the currency of the user, because you have to be responsible. All frauds are insider jobs. You cannot have a bitcoin holding business with many people, because as the value increases anyone will steal those bitcoins.
Bitcoin is about trust in one person, behind an alias maybe; but allows for transactions between everyone in a civilization of 7 billion, that's the real endgame: Small villages of trust on the internet, exchanging bitcoin for digital services and user generated content.
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:34:09
I disagree. Multisig only makes things more complex, it doesn't help against insiders (multiple) ability to steal the funds.

I use 3x underclocked 28nm Monarches to heat my house in the winter because they are completely silent. Will they become obsolete, sure... but it remains to be seen how far below 0.5W/GH you can push silicon.
KNC stated 0.01W/GH I think, on their "not to be sold" 16nm chips. I doubt that, 0.05W/GH is probably more reasonable, but after 16nm we are starting to hit a energy efficiency wall because when you go smaller than that you have physical problems that Intel are facing right now with 10nm. So a BTC miner will be a long term investment at some point soon.
As for the social benefit of Bitcoin we'll see after the global debt bubble pops.
@_date: 2015-05-01 21:03:57
It's interesting that the necktie crowd can't seem to tax the financial sector, but they still think they can control bitcoin. Both are virtual and will move and transform around anything you throw at them. One day every politician, lawyer and economist will realize how profoundly meaningless their existence has been, I think bitcoin is a great catalyst to this epiphany.
@_date: 2015-05-20 10:05:55
The only important question answered was the separation between bitcoin and the blockchain, there is *none*; banks and companies will one day start to mine *bitcoin*.
I like how the traditional financial instruments completely fail to derive value on top of bitcoin; the only way that banksters will be able to enter the game is by mining = 21. Which is the value of that company, but I doubt it will derive much of that potential either. Nobody will buy a heater that mines for somebody else when they can buy one that mines for them!
I also like how Satishi does not spend a dime of that first million BTC (that are probably lost) in contrast to the billions $ that the banksters will throw in to compete with the chinese for the last 7 million bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-02 07:44:08
You mean the thing that lawyers are trying to patent. Yes well that sure is not solving anything we hadn't solved already. It's just proof that when you try to shoehorn bitcoin into our debt society it just becomes obvious how wrong everything is.

Some questions:
1) The pruning must be smart enough to keep blocks for old addresses when you start pruning?
2) If so, it's very important to have the right wallet in place before you begin the pruning?
3) How many blocks upstream does the pruning keep for security for each transaction for addresses in the wallet?
4) How is pruning started, just by rebooting the bitcoind with a flag?
5) Is the bitcoind then busy or can it take RPC requests during that time?
6) How long time does the pruning take?
Is there a plan to add some way for the pruned bitcoind to ask the network for old blocks for a particular address if you import it?
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:18:52
That sounds like a good argument for governments to ban guns if you ask me.
Not far from: "guns don't kill people, people kill people".
Since the most cost effective solution for death is a rock, I vote for the rock. Let's stop wasting energy on how people die and focus on why they are born in the first place:
Without burning half of the stored sunlight on earth we would be around 1 billion people right now, I think that pretty much covers death for the next 50 years. Don't you?

No it actually rolls over to addresses owned by other accounts resulting in a negative balance for the account used to send the payment. You have to manually check getBalance for each account to avoid this. Normally you don't use accounts, but for me that hosts an online bitcoin wallet this is a funny "feature" to deal with.

@_date: 2015-07-28 13:51:14

Actually if you're not careful managing accounts on the original bitcoind this can happen there too! Since bitcoind uses all the funds available to it, if you don't check; it will start spending other accounts output. It's a  debt world we live in, I'm telling ya! ;)
@_date: 2016-02-16 13:17:04
Or if you can send another transaction from/to the same addresses, with a fee; the miner that picks up the transaction with the fee, will also mine the one without.
If the miner is nice. Worked for me last time I forgot to add a fee.

Default on all excess debt, which is probably around 90% of all valuations. So whatever you can borrow to buy has to go down with 90%, that includes housing, cars, machines and employees. The stockmarket and the normal interest rate is over for this civilization. And then peak everything hits us in the head. These two are not unrelated, but their effects are counter intuitive (30$ oil). Edit: And third peak electronics hits us (around 16nm), so pile up those tiny ARM processor computers because they will not get any better after 16nm!
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:46:54
A bit OT, but why couldn't each transaction be a "block"? That way we wouldn't need pools, confirms would be instantaneous and block size wouldn't matter. Is it disk size, if so; could real pruning help?
Basically we would lower the difficulty so that there would be a pool of matching winning hashes to lock the transactions! 
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:25:10
There is a problem, the companies relies on the same debt as the housing bubble. The only solution is to split interest rates per category of debt, but at that point cashless NIRP base salary is probably a more effective means of getting the fake growth going.
Ultimately there can only be hyperinflation, as a matter of fact QE and NIRP _are_ hyperinflation with debt to counter the debt deflation. It's completely retarded. The 200 million SEK obligations the riksbank is buying during the next 6 months _is_ debt. At some point the companies getting the money will have to pay for that money.
The only consequence of NIRP is banks going out of business. And without banks the companies (even the extremely few healthy ones left, say 5% of all companies) will struggle because (especially in sweden) they all rely on debt.
At some point politicians will panic and all the debt will become real money and then, tada, hyperinflation!

I run 3x monarches (yes I know) underclocked to a total of 1.4TH at 800W for my 33 square meter cabin in the woods over 4G with a carbon fiber mast and yagi antenna. One in the living/bed-room and two in the kitchen. The one in the bedroom is underclocked all the way down and completely silent = not a whisper and generates 200W under my desk because sitting still with freezing feet is really really bad. The two in the kitchen run at 300W each and make a little blowing noise but no electric buzzing.
I'm in Sweden so electricity is mainly taxes, but the same price as over in US, BUT (big BUT) it's made to 50% of waterfall = less hydrocarbon issue.
But anywho, the economics are FIAT/BTC 1:1, basically exchanging my currency via the power company, and the heat is for free.
Another really great feature is that the fans will circulate the air without which the old wooden cabin would be freezing on the floor and hot at the ceiling.
I guess to only problem with BTC heating right now is that every year you kinda have to upgrade if you want to be sure to get FIAT/BTC 1:1, next winter is going to be 16nm and it's not good for the environment or the wallet to keep throwing hardware away every year.
I think I will actually stick with the monarches next winter, that are very silent, unless something amazing pops up.

BTC heating is constant and still hard to turn up and down (I connect with Putty on the COM port and paste commands manually to each miner, pain in the  if you have many machines because they all have different quality and require custom settings to run optimally).
I use a woodstove as waterheater too, with a huge 100 liter casserole with water tap at the bottom so I need to keep the heat down with the BTC machines otherwise it would be a sauna.
My house also has a heatwall (finnish invention too, where the hot smoke from the kitchen goes into the living room and weaves in the wall before going out through the chimney) which makes the 200W suffice in that room.
That sounds like you have a castle?
@_date: 2015-04-19 21:16:19
I had the same idea, but the guys at bitcointalk told me it wouldn't make sense because the components change every iteration and the sockets are often different.

You are looking at it the wrong way; how come people are willing to pay &gt;1$ transaction fee? It's because bitcoin is on the way of becoming the new global reserve currency. In that context who cares about people that aren't willing to pay the transaction fee? We are not supposed to use Bitcoin for commerce, yet, until both private and decentralized layer-2 becomes available/stable.
@_date: 2015-03-30 07:03:01
Before fiat dies, there is probably going to be a deflationary sqeeze, so make sure you have enough fiat cash to ride out the storm; otherwise you might have to sell your bitcoin before they reach their true potential.
Also, for the same reason, you have to pay all your debts first!
If your rent/house does not include heating I suggest you contribute to the network by heating your home in the winter with bitcoin machines, the newest ones can be underclocked to run silently.
This way you are converting fiat to bitcoin through your electricity bill while using the bi-product (heat and hashes) for something useful at the same time (both heating your home and contributing to the network).
But winter is now almost over so wait until this summer to order the next generation miners for next winter. That generation will probably lean towards the limit in transistor size (20 - 16 nm) making the investment less wasteful.
With difficulty stabilizing and each block still rewarding 25 bitcoins it's a good time to mine!

I agree, it's about trust (fear/optimism) and there are 2 things at play in this video:
1) Varoufakis has invested his whole life in understanding the flawed system we have today. He's in it knee deep and he can't accept any solution that does not mandate his investment.
2) Varoufakis pretends to not understand physics, photosyntesis or any of the underlying facts of this planet because of 1). You cannot vote yourself a new energy source, we only have the sun and the stored sunrays are depleting fast.
The world is deflationary because we have peaked in every aspect possible; energy, population, computing, complexity, knowledge, etc. You can't fight deflation without "growth", this ship is going down no matter how you turn it. Brace for impact.
The only thing we have to fear is the people telling us not to fear.
