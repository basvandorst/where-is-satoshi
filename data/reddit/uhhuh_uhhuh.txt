Thanks for being such a positive role model to the rest of us!

Wasn't in the article, but nevertheless, the article prompted me to check the BTC price chart. It looks like a cup and handle is forming, and that is very bullish.

Wow, really glad I didn't go with Coinbase.

Wow, that is a remarkably dumb conclusion. Systems can't hold an exponential incline; they will inevitably fall back, but if the underlying trend is still positive overall, it can still be a good hold. One can also ride the incline as a signal to start watching for a sell signal (starts falling past a  previous support), wait until it levels out, buy back when it starts to rise again. A good book on technical analysis chart patterns might be helpful.

That's a relief.

"not legally liable" - how do you know that? My understanding is that hasn't been determined and is being investigated now.

Not happy with Coinbase clumsy startup process. The ACH thing is ridiculous; Coinbase sending emails stating deposits have been made and to verify my account when no such deposits were made and no response from support when they were notified of this. I don't have time with clumsy apps, so moving on. Glad this thread exists.

If you stick to that, you are brilliant.

I was disappointed (not to mention, inconvenienced) with Circle's $300 weekly limit, but my first purchase appears to have worked within 30 minutes. I used a debit card to deposit $300 into my account and then sent roughly .46 bitcoin right after adding the funds. I confirmed with the recipient  that they received the Bitcoin payment and also received an email from Circle confirming the payment. So, other than the low limit, Circle seems ok so far.
