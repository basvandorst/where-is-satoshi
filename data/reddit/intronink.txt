Redditors are poor. therefore their opinion is useless.  To get get rich you have to abuse the system.  Those people are rich and don't complain on reddit.  Just as the video states, Nothin poor people hate will ever be made illegal

lol at these comments, the butthurt is real.  I'm soo glad I voted for Trump. This thread alone makes it worthwhile but having 4 years fucking angry idiots being idiots.  I don't imagine I'll be sad for a very long time I when I just on reddit see what people have to say about trump.
