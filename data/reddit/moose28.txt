I did and one article was trying to say that a third of all mined bitcoins had been lost, which is frankly ridiculous. 
Estimates were all over the place.

Bitcoin and predictable are not shared terms. Logically prices should increase but it may not be immediately felt but rather a steady rise after

Yeah I've seen a lot of people with the idea that even if he is still alive and watching Bitcoin, his 1 million (or more if he has them) bitcoins could possible remain forever dormant.

Yeah I expected some sarcastic responses, it was mainly just out of curiosity I asked the question.
Like you said I can only imagine it will eventually impact price since there is even less than the finite limit of 21 million in circulation.

I understand that, but shouldn't my transaction at least be broadcasted to the network? It has not hit the blockchain at all.

This is incredibly annoying, I understand that confirmation times may be slow but it hasn't even hit the blockchain which is ridiculous.

Looks like I’m torn between Bittrex and hitbtc. I just want to get my bitcoin gold to immediately sell and move my coins back to the original spot.

I think you get an equal amount to whatever you have, even if it’s less than a full coin.

This website is the way to go.
They helped me recover a wallet (that would have been horror inducing to lose) that I had lost access to in the early years of Bitcoin, and payment is only paid if successful, no risk of payment for no results.
You don't need to pay someone 15 BTC, it's really overkill.
