Sounds like FUD to me. Source?

I commend your effort, but its too hard to read.

Looks like they're back.

Although they stated that they're starting to beta test btc payments tomorrow I went down today to try them out. I offered to be their guinea pig and within 3 secs the transaction was approved. Highly impressed!
Oh, and their sub's are tasty too!

And it's only going to get worse.

I've been using Circle recently, but my second choice is coinjar.

I've been using my NAB debit card. Used it about 4-5 times with no issues.

FUD, downvoted.
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:40:58
Cause they haven't signalled for segwit yet. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:19:50
So you're advocating a potential 51% attack?
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:42:55
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:11:11
Surely they would have prepared for this moment in advance and signalled appropriately?
@_date: 2016-12-13 06:46:40
What about third world countries who can't afford $50 to open/ close channels?
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:16:11
This is so fucken funny! Why wouldn't you be ready to signal for segwit straight away.... Unless you doubted it.
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:12:05
What problems?
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:17:08
Time to find a better hiding spot ��
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:00:14
I smell a conspiracy...
@_date: 2017-04-02 08:46:34
April fools!

Democracy at its best!

Not boring enough for you to kick up a fuss about it.
@_date: 2017-04-02 10:08:27
FUD, downvoted.

Ahem.... Citations needed. I see unlimited alive and well. See I can say any facts too. It must be true!

Or maybe the rest of the world where english isn't heir native language.
@_date: 2017-04-02 10:32:03
It's spam, don't worry /s
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:25:42
Seems to be the case. Coincided with them accepting segwit transactions in their blocks. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:15:36
They don't need to. You're gonna do it for them. Who's the rational actors now?

My parents pretty much think its play money. I'm gonna be soo happy when they turn 65 in 4 years time and gift them the 1 bitcoin each I've invested for them.
I'm hoping by that time it will pay for their round the world trip. They deserve it.
