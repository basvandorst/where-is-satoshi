just read the specs: "if the first block post-fork is &gt;12 hours, then the work needed for the next block will be lowered. Finding that first post-fork block will, however, be hard because that will be at full difficulty."
perhaps they are just waiting 12 hs to start mining, thus lowering the difficulty

But Opendime could be generating private keys that look random, but are all from the same HD (bip32) tree which we control?
You can actually prove to yourself that we cannot know the private key. The process for this verification can only be done after the unit is unsealed, and requires a verbatim copy of the original data written. Plus, you'll need to precisely control what is written to the drive, which cannot be done with higher-level commands to load entropy (so drag-n-drop will not work).
In summary, the process is as follows: take a new Opendime, power it up and precisely write 256k of known bytes to it (ie. use dd to write it starting at block zero). The unit will pick a private key as normal. Unseal the Opendime (poke the hole / break the tab), and run the file advanced/rngverify.py with Python. That file is a simple program that contains the (previously) unknown entropy value from the Opendime, and it checks that your entropy is hashed into the secret key. Effectively, it re-creates the entire key-picking process and to demonstrate we used exactly that process. Because it's just 75 lines of python, it's very easy to audit.
As you will see, the secret exponent of the private key is the double-SHA256 of these values concatenated: (the 256k bytes from you) + (128-bit serial number of the Opendime in base32) + (32-byte nonce picked by Opendime's RNG).
See our source code on github for a complete and executable example.

I've been a investor in BLC since the first days and I think "Regulatory Pressure" if far from being the real cause here. 
An excessive amount of Loan listings were scammers, and in this final months, listings consisted on just 1 or 2 "legit" loans.
So I would say they are closing because the market was not ready yet for this kind of loans. They couldn't assure the customers they BTC were safe, they failed to provide trust in an untrusted ecosystem.
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:27:16
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:31:57
I think the only "secure" solution at the time beeing would be injecting "global" BTC fundind into "local" loan services, who can do all the required verifications and also converting BTC into local fiat.

BIP39 was introduced two years after Electrum. BIP39 seeds include a checksum, in order to help users figure out typing errors. However, BIP39 suffers the same shortcomings as early Electrum seed phrases:
* A fixed wordlist is still required. Following our recommendation, BIP39 authors decided to derive keys and addresses in a way that does not depend on the wordlist. However, BIP39 still requires the wordlist in order to compute its checksum, which is plainly inconsistent, and defeats the purpose of our recommendation. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that BIP39 proposes to create one wordlist per language. This threatens the portability of BIP39 seed phrases.
* BIP39 seed phrases do not include a version number. This means that software should always know how to generate keys and addresses. BIP43 suggests that wallet software will try various existing derivation schemes within the BIP32 framework. This is extremely inefficient and rests on the assumption that future wallets will support all previously accepted derivation methods. If, in the future, a wallet developer decides not to implement a particular derivation method because it is deprecated, then the software will not be able to detect that the corresponding seed phrases are not supported, and it will return an empty wallet instead. This threatens users funds.
For these reasons, Electrum does not generate BIP39 seeds.

from their site: 
"Bitcoin Cash already had the capability to provide opt-in replay protection. It did this by implementing a new transaction type which is not valid on the legacy Bitcoin network, and providing a way to prevent replay of legacy Bitcoin transactions containing a special OP_RETURN value."

txh, but that is valid only if you trust that **electron cash** implements the "sunset clause"
as I see it, the only safe and untrusting way is to move to a new **electrum** wallet before the fork
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:52:50
If you don't do anything you will have both BTC and BCC, but to use them you will have to import the seeds into some wallet like electron cash. If you do so directly without these steps, perhaps electron cash will take both BTC and BCC, we can't tell. If you don't plan to use any bcash wallet, you are fine with electrum only

only safe way is as said:
Before the fork, move the coins with **electrum**, and after the fork, import the old seeds with **electron cash**
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:04:35
1. because electron cash uses the same folders
2. because when you import the seed, the wallet controls all the addresses generated by that seed
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:39:17
A very good point, you make.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:41:55
no, I don't trust them at all. with  solution, you don't need to, because you are importing old seeds that are already moved to another wallet with **electrum**
please read  solution carefully

I've found [your response]( very informative
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:38:10
correct, will delete this one
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:36:55
you can keep them forever if you like, however, many think bcc price will tank soon

this ^ ! seed generates keys, and keys control coins, so, yes

The only reason to use electron cash is to move my bcc to an exchange after the fork, sell them for btc, and forget about it
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:32:59
it didn't happen with LTC and it won't happen here
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:01:27
thx, I will give it a try !
do you know if it supports replace-by-fee ?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:25:55
that was rude
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:47:16


I meant, via a source code fork

from [the electrum post]( 
The person who distributes the Electron Cash binaries has decided to remain anonymous, and uses the fake name "Jonald Fyookball" in order to sign Electron Cash binaries. Thus, if these binaries contain code that is designed to steal your bitcoins, the author of the theft will be anonymous and walk away safely with your funds.
However, both wallets (bitcoinAbc and electron cash) are open source and you can compile them yourself

@_date: 2017-07-20 21:27:53
you are welcome
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:11:02
that should work as well
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:06:03
that is why it is important to move your btc to a diffrent electrum wallet before importing the seed with electron cash
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:54:44

 We recommend to proceed as follows:
 1. Install **Electron Cash on a machine that does not have your
 Electrum wallets**
 2. Wait until the BCC hard fork has taken place, and a few BCC blocks
 have been mined.
 3. Move all your Electrum funds to a new Electrum wallet. This will
 move only your BTC, and not your BCC, because the BCC blockchain has
 replay protection. Wait until the transaction is confirmed.
 4. Enter the seed of your (now empty) old wallet or private keys in
 Electron Cash. Since the BTC have been moved to a new wallet,
 entering your old seed in Electron Cash will not put your BTC funds
 at risk.
Following these 4 easy steps you will be able to access your BCC
without compromising your BTC.
