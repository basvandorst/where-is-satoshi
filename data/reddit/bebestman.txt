Still not a solution for a robust system to exchange cash and bitcoin.
Currently, if you are in Germany it is pretty difficult to exchange, say, 10000€ cash to bitcoin. The only way are methods that leave a pretty evident paper trail.

I applaud your effort. Every decentralized service is another great achievement in bringing privacy and safety from censorship to the masses.
There is a flaw in Bitsquare, reliance on the legacy payment system and thus necessarily creating a paper trail and being vulnerable to censorship. Even worse, you exclude the unbanked population, as there is no way that I can pick 200€ from my wallet in cash and turn it into bitcoin on bitsquare without going through another institution first.
Localbitcoins is a great service that allows direct cash trades, but it is centralized and thus vulnerable to regulation and censorship, as can be seen in Germany. Two options I see are to either extend Bitsquare to support cash trades or to use the code base and create a second project, intended to replace Localbitcoins on a decentralized and censorship resistant basis, giving the unbanked population access to bitcoin.

Not internally, no. But I am sure credit card processing fees take up a huge part of their margin. Bitcoin can be similarly quick for deposits and withdrawals but cheaper by quite a margin.

Development of the app seems to be progressing, now they are trying to get more traffic to it. Trade volume for fiat is still very small, but seems to be higher where SEPA is available. I didn't check trade volumes for other crypto.

I've been wondering for a while why people *don't* flock to exchanges like Gemini that are licenced, regulated and insured. Yes, yes, there is the whole anarchy angle to bitcoin, but that also means not to rely on any centralized party like bitfinex and instead to use something like bitsquare.io that is actually decentralized and virtually impossible to censor.
Actually, a really resistant ecosystem should have both types of solutions: Centralized/regulated and decentralized/unregulated.
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:41:11


That can't be right.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:52:12
localbitcoins is ultimately a centralized service and can easily be shut down by authorities, as it was in Germany. bitsquare however is decentralized and not easily shut down.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:00:59
Fascinating. Something like this can be a great fallback method for when network access or electrical power is not readily and easily available. Maybe with some thought a company could turn this into some kind of polymer paper note with standardized denominations.
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:34:03
Bitcoin is perfect for payments over country borders and people from all over the world, even high schoolers can earn a bit of money this way, with no one able to prevent the transaction or to censor it after the fact. Awesome!
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:37:18
Lame. Is that something that can be fixed? With cash there is literally no paper trail as opposed to bank transfers. Or is that the exact problem, that it is difficult to prove that cash actually changed hands?
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:05:36
Funny, just the other day I was thinking about how much easier it is now to have decentralized money and money accounts than to have distributed identity. If my email provider or Facebook are gone, my digital identity goes with them, unlike my wealth regarding both fiat and bitcoin.
Systems like this solve that problem. Ideally, people would just plug my blockchain id into their software of choice and this would try to contact me regardless of providers, if any.
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:20:23
On that topic, I always wondered why adult content is either unwilling to offer bitcoin payments in the first place or to ask higher prices if it is available at all. Even when comparing "one month once" with "one month once."
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:19:51


Still looking forward to a decentralized, easily accessible alternative. In Germany localbitcoins is unavailable due to regulation and bitsquare doesn't support cash trades. Mycelium is decentralized but bound to a single wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:41:33
Nice to see that development is progressing, despite the nay-sayers. It will be very exciting when we can actually pay instantaneously and it is economically feasible to have micropayments.
@_date: 2016-08-18 22:30:03
The bitcoin ecosystem isn't ready yet by far to be useful to "the average person" or even "the average redditor."
In places with a working banking infrastructure and a reasonably stable currency the system works well enough that bitcoin still has more costs than benefits compared to the alternative.
We see bitcoin pop up where this is not the case, for example buying illicit goods from the internet, where the legacy payment system is not available. Or transferring value internationally where the legacy payment system is way too expensive compared to bitcoin.
The only niche I could potentially see for bitcoin is merchants offering discounts for buying with bitcoin, assuming that the processing costs are much lower than with CC, still the most popular payment method in the US. But the bitcoin user base is apparently way too small to make this a significant pull factor.
Edit: Micropayments, potentially. But the bitcoin ecosystem itself doesn't support it yet. You could potentially pay websites per view for economically infeasibly tiny values, down to one Satoshi. The legacy payment almost inherently can't do this.
@_date: 2016-08-18 23:37:13
That would be awesome. And a genuine use case for bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:09:22
Will you raise the limits in the future? Limits seem like a *very* crude tool for fraud prevention.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:08:36
I get your hesitation, you want a platform with a *very* high standard of proof. The problem a lot of the users around here have is that they want an exchange that is both *decentralized* and *uncensorable*. Dependency on the legacy bank system achieves your goal of provability but is vulnerable to censorship, not to mention that it excludes the unbanked population.
The only solution I see is to relax the requirement for proof, together with arbitration and to rely only on a reputation system for cash in person. I argue that it goes well *with* your philosophy, as posted on the website:




Cash face-to-face doesn't generate a paper trail and is thus the ultimate payment method regarding privacy.
What are your thoughts?
~~A completely unrelated question: You want to turn bitsquare into a DAO. What will that entail and what is the vision here? I'm not sure I see the clear benefit of a open-source project turning into a DAO.~~
Edit: I read the [whitepaper]( again, it makes sense with the fees. However, in the paper I found this:




So the categorical denial of cash does not directly follow from the whitepaper.
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:57:20
Cash transfer, ideally. We need a decentralized alternative to localbitcoins.
@_date: 2016-08-18 22:18:34


Humble Bundle not anymore, at least temporarily.


It is surprising how few of these accept bitcoin. It is also surprising that when they do accept bitcoin that they charge more than with CC.
@_date: 2016-08-19 00:13:54
1. There is little notion of a "bitcoin account" as the only relevant thing is your public address and its private key.
2. If you are talking about a single address as a "bitcoin account", then yes, there is the benefit of easier accounting and increased privacy as not everyone who does business with you knows your non-business related wealth.
3. Given that there is no notion of a "bitcoin account" and that you can have as many addresses as you want, it is even advantageous to have a separate address for each and every payment you receive for increased privacy, easier accounting and increased safety in case the signature scheme of bitcoin is compromised.
4. You can link all your accounts in a deterministic fashion with HD wallets, so you separation could go "Master Key -&gt; Business Key -&gt; Accounts Receivable -&gt; Alice" with little realistic way for Alice to know who else your customers are. That is, until you start to collect payments, but you could use a service like JoinMarket to obfuscate the connection between your customers, your suppliers and your private accounts.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:07:17
Alright. Too bad then, I was really looking forward to a decentralized alternative to localbitcoins, as cash is the one legacy payment system that is impossible to effectively censor.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:27:32
Is it possible with bitsquare to trade cash in person? That is, can bitsquare replace localbitcoins?
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:37:29
In other words, a first version of LN can be deployed on mainnet right now?

So assume this software is out and a network in place. Does this mean that I can buy computation hardware, rent it out to the network and make a decent profit off it? If so, do you have some estimate how much that could be?
@_date: 2015-08-02 23:57:17
A system like this incentivises people to build a second layer to traditional internet infrastructure and thus makes the web massively more resistant against disruptions and censorship.
In general, I expect bitcoin to replace and/or complement traditional subscription services as the current subscription model is a substitute for complicated and expensive pay-as-you-go systems.

Now that is much closer to a reasonable price. I will try it a bit later.
Do you know of a similar project for music?
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:32:12
Where do you see that option? Because I don't see it.
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:39:45
Yes, for a 30s clip that is extremely steep, that is about $25 for one hour, twice what I pay for Netflix per month. Since I use Netflix for about 30 to 60 hours per month, an equivalent price would be 0.3 cent.
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:32:35
How? The option is not present for me.
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:16:02
From their website:


So they set a price floor, which itself is much higher than the bound I gave in the other post.
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:06:10


For the start, sure. It was the same with bitcoin, then someone managed to get graphics cards to do computation and then ASICs came along. Personally, I am looking for something between a hobby and an income stream for some beer money, so this would be nice.
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:24:00
Germany here. Virtually all of EU is available, but not Germany. Would love to have one convenient service I can point interested people to.

Prices seem a bit steep.
Edit: Retarded question incoming, why does this not exist for porn? Aren't they usually the ones driving technological innovation?
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:28:02
If you go by [Landauer's principle]( and just assume that for each of the 2^160 possible addresses you need the lowest possible amount of energy at room temperature, you'll need about 4*10^27 J of energy, that is about [10 seconds of the suns toal energy output](
Can we get the number bigger? Substituting more algorithmically accurate numbers for generating a private key might give a couple of orders of magnitude more, raising the energy required to 15 minutes worth or more. Changing to current numbers with regards to computation efficiency may give a couple of orders more, reaching 250 hours worth of the sun's total energy output.
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:03:40
And in the American nations.
@_date: 2015-07-31 09:49:15
So they're available in all EU countries except Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia and **Germany**. Our regulatory framework must be really bad.
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:02:46


Wait, does that mean there will be no market mechanism to establish the price of computation?
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:41:09
Popcorntime is based on bittorrent. Joystream is bittorrent enabled with micropayments. Depending on how flexible the integrations are you could do this quite easily.

I thought they'd have to rule well within this year, or am I mixing something up?
@_date: 2016-09-08 14:48:45
That would be one possible solution. Something like that is actually in the works for OpenBazaar so that you don't have to keep your node running for others to see your offers and you can go offline whenever you want.
@_date: 2016-09-11 15:58:43
The comments are surprisingly not negative. Not positive either, just not negative. Compare this to even a year ago when I'd have been willing to bet good money on the three top comments to be "lol bitcoin unstable", "not real money" and "so wasteful much drugs." Now the comments are much more civil and the worst I have read was a very realistic "It seems to solve a problem I don't have and make it more complicated", regarding paying for groceries.
And that seems to be still the crux of the matter: Bitcoin doesn't solve any immediate problem in the first world. Not yet, at least.
@_date: 2016-05-29 07:04:16


Well, they don't matter anymore now, do they.
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:46:55
This is what is so fascinating about bitcoin: Many people can propose various approaches to solve a problem and over time we can select the better ones. Transactions are malleable? SegWit could be a solution. Upper limit on transactions? Payment channels could be a solution. How to remain off-chain and find other network participants? Lightning Network with Flare could be a solution.
And potentially 100,000TPS for the whole network should be sufficient for some time of network growth from the current almost 7TPS.

The chart is pretty meaningless without giving some context.
