Thank you very much, looks very nice indeed!
Will definitely pay it forward to introduce someone new to BTC as promised

Lol, just got started with changetip, so still learning, is this also a tip in some way? o.O

I think the backup you made through Mycelium is secure, but is Mycelium's database itself encrypted in any way? 
If not, then any rooted app could access your private keys easily. 
In addition, as you use Titanium Backup, I think these backups also contain your keys without encryption. 
I could be wrong, but I would look into this further if I were you.
Good luck :-(

Lol, I just got the same postcard! 
I'm from Belgium and haven't done anything / filled any forms / ... so I suppose everyone with a balance at Gox got this.

I regularly set up (interested) friends and colleagues with a Bitcoin wallet with usually about $2 in it, so tips to be able to keep doing that are always welcome. 
Guess I would also finally have to start checking out changetip and see how it works ;-)

Yes :)

I'm sending them a mail now, let's show them we're interested in Belgium as well :)

Actually, he lost more than 290 Bitcoins; Look at the bets below.

There is no minimum :)
You can spend as little as 0.000000001 (1 satoshi) if you like.
If you send less than 0.01 though (or if your final balance after the transaction is less than 0.01) , a transaction fee of 0.0001 is required though or else the transaction won't go through.

Yay! Got the same reply in Dutch with a link to the post of Thuisbezorgd.nl:

Did anything ever happen to this project?
I installed it on my device and didn't get any results, at first I thought this was because there are no places accepting bitcoin within 10km of me, but looking at the code, it seems like the data url " doesn't work anymore.
Would be too bad to see the time invested here go to waste.

Thanks for clarification; So then, what exactly does this mean?
It just means that both sales tax and VAT are exactly the same whether you pay with Bitcoin or with Euro's?
Seems logical to me , so not sure how this is news then:)

hmm, thank you for the clarification. Didn't know it worked like that.
I'm from Belgium myself and was actually planning to contact a few companies I know well to help them set up Bitcoin payments but that's quite a dealbreaker.
Guess I'll have to check with my accountant how they treat it here.
