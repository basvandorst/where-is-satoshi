I don’t think that’s how statistics work. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 14:43:56
I’m assuming you meant to type prosecute? I could see that indeed. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 14:19:46
Why the foreigner part? That’s unnecessarily limiting imo. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:28:43
Cool story bruh.

People get btc over wechat/alipay or localbitcoin. No one is being annoyed over this, it's just that you need a VPN to access exchanges. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:52:06
I’m not implying anything, I’m stating a fact. Regarding your comment, isn’t the point of bitcoin to be immune to censorship?
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:00:51
Wow you’re dumb. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:52:54
Yeah tax evasion is a crime like in any country, you’re right. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 16:36:17
Lmao, really? With all the slang, dirty language, and street grammar I packed in that comment? Seems you‘ll always find a way to ridicule you yourself by going for the stupidest comment every time. . Ah well, comme disait Brassens, [quand on est con, on est con](

Thousands of us buying and selling crypto OTC in China everyday, without a VPN. Stop spreading fantasies thanks.
@_date: 2019-01-01 01:48:00
Yeah well I lived in serbia for decades, and now I live in china. So what? You’re still a brainwashed idiot that calls for people to be thrown in jail for stating facts. Keep being emotional, me and the grownups will deal with the facts.

We buy and sell crypto over Wechat everyday, stop spreading nonsense thanks.

Didn’t come across as such to me, but fair enough. 


That’s why I acknowledged it in my next sentence, and said no one forces you to pay. Also you might judge their content crappy, but that’s just your opinion, others might find it valuable. I haven’t given a lot of attention to those guys, but when my girlfriend lost her father and went through depression and was lost in her life, Peterson’s lectures helped her get back on her feet and make tremendously positive changes in her life. The snippets I overheard from the lectures all seem to be very factual, smart and eloquent to me. Also the dude is a pretty high level academic. Not sure “pseudo-intellectual” is appropriate here. But eh it’s all subjective, and that’s not what we’re talking about here anyway. 


In a crypto sub making money off bitcoin.

lol you so mad
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:44:43
lmfao you don’t just refuse to read stuff, but when you actually read it you also don’t understand it eh? 
What copycat vapor ware? 
I thought you were just a moron, but you’re reaching astonishing levels of idiocy.

Because he says he **refuses** to read something he doesn’t know about. That’s the best way to never challenge any of your views, that’s textbook dumb. 
Because the reason he says he doesn’t agree with it is terribly wrong. Patreon isn’t for “handouts” (which is quite a dumb term to begin with, but that’s another debate). It’s for monetizing content creation. As an artist, I know many people think I’m not really working, but I can also list a bazillion reasons why it’s wrong. And there’s nothing wrong in wanting to cut greedy middle men like labels and publishers to directly reach the public. Granted a lot of content is of questionable quality, but no one forces you to pay. 
Aren’t we all opportunists here? I mean yeah the tech is great and banking the unbanked is a beautiful thing, but aren’t we all here to make money first? Why denying it to others then? 
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:22:02
I don’t need to be articulate, every single sentence of your comment eloquently works towards demonstrating how dumb you are. 
But it’s ok, according to your thought process, you will refuse to read my comment because you don’t agree with it, when in reality you couldn’t be more mistaken about its meaning. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 07:57:18
I am indeed basing myself on that framing. I’ll look into what you said , it’s interesting. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:28:16


Well I'm french, and I can very nicely tell you d'aller te faire enculer avec tes intox toutes bidons que même en enfant de cinq and y croirait pas, retourne sur le Donald gros con. 
Thank you.

Wow. Boobs. Hilarious.

Peterson has very informed and interesting views on many thinkers and philosophers. His lectures about Carl Jung, notably, are fascinating. You just slapping a hateful tag on him because you didn’t like something he said or done makes you sound like you could hardly finish reading a tweet without losing focus.

Isn’t this what SafeHaven is doing? Not 100% caught up on it so might be wrong, but I think that’s their whole concept there.

Which archives? Or do you mean the questionable testimony of people who weren’t even there? Genuine question tho, which archives?

What do you mean “I believe”? What I believe isn’t relevant, we’re talking about facts here. Since the ussr archives have been open in the 90’s, historians have had to revisit their estimations and lower them by **a lot**. Stalin is responsible for **way less** death than Hitler. Even historians like Timothy Snyder -who isn’t exactly left wing- has had to change his views. Here’s what he has to say: 
My point stands, most people perceptions today are based on propaganda and overinflated figures. And while the truth is readily available for anyone to read, no one seems interested in changing their erroneous views. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 16:30:17
Have you listened to his lectures tho? If you have, what part makes you say he’s alt right? If you haven’t, maybe you shouldn’t trust a 20m video and see for yourself instead? 
 I hear in this thread he sends gay porn to alt right people who follow him because he doesn’t want them. Not sure if true as I hadn’t heard, but that gave me a chuckle. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:10:02
Archives that have been available for over a decade actually reliably deny that. But perceptions are hard to change, even when presented with cold hard facts...

What the... left is about giving the workers the mean of production, and equally redestributing wealth. Right is about liberalism, and capitalism. It’s been so for hundreds of years now, how the hell did you come up with such weird definitions? I get that in the US left and right have different meaning, and that they should rather be called right and extreme right. But by any standards your definition is way off.  
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:53:31
Jordan Peterson is alt-right? I’ve watched hours of philosophy videos of him and I don’t know what you’re talking about.  Source?

Yeah beer in Europe is shit. Not like they invented it or something eh ��
