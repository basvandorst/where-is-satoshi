Don't BUY Monero (mine it)... ;) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:29:59
Agreed. Monero is the only truly fungible cryptocurrency - meaning all coins are identical. No ability to distinguish coins from each other.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:06:42
No, it's better.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:21:00
Of course they are. You would use Monero if you wanted any kind of privacy.
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:08:34
I've heard it's 11% of the US population
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:30:07
After that, FPGAs and ASICs.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:48:39
Yep, any HD wallet does this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:31:09
Look up Dollar Cost Averaging. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:11:59
There is nothing anonymous about Bitcoin.
This is why Monero is the sleeping giant. It's the only one to answer the privacy, fungibllity and block size problems.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:09:12
Most definitely. That f59kuE on the end is a checksum, allowing the address to be a valid address, but no one can know the private key the address must be made from, ensuring the contents can't be moved (spent). 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:13:36
It's not fungible.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:01:12
Didn't he say the end of 2020? 
@_date: 2014-06-18 04:46:34
Because in the example above, the use of fiat has been reduced to the point  where it is not the preferred money.
@_date: 2014-07-31 09:58:49
Sat o shit an go
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:13:34
Good point.
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:35:20
Monero wasn't code forked from Bitcoin, it's from the cryptonote codebase. Designed to be private from scratch.
@_date: 2014-05-22 08:59:03
Woohoo! I'm starving.
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:02:43
I think I remember reading that Finland is broadcasting the block chain over television signals. Would that help in a situation like this?
@_date: 2014-08-17 00:57:54
Actually - less expansion of the money supply (considering it's fixed and known), and more increase the velocity of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:41:24
Some of these are actually quite good!
@_date: 2014-06-16 09:52:29
Yep, that looks like it. It also has a mechanism for communicating a change address.
Also has a banana for scale...

Wouldn't the balance have moved to the merchant's addr? (just like cash) Then the trust comes in trusting them to give you change (just like cash) to either that addr, or another addr.

No you cant, as it uses the blockchain like any other bitcoin transaction.


Yeah, but we also cant buy anything if we don't have card or cash, right now.


The discussion is regarding using the paper as a backup in case there are no other avenues. I.e. no phone to pay with.


Anything that is worthwhile in life can be stolen. This is why we protect things of worth.

Maybe charity, research, grants, etc. He seems like an intelligent and generally nice fellow who thinks things through.
He will probably hold until a reasonable percentage of goods and services are priced in Bitcoin, so his lump of coins are more likely to help the Bitcoin economy through expansion of the money supply, as opposed to those coins being (or expected to be) sold off (therefore affecting the price) at exchanges if he sold earlier.

It is unlikely two randomly shuffled decks of playing cards have ever ended up with the same sequence. Ever. In the history of the universe. Playing cards have 52 cards, from a possible 52 cards, and these 52 cards are of course public knowledge.
12 or 24 seed words from a possible lot of 1600 creates a private key which is  impossibly hard to chance upon.
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:59:02
Thanks but FRNs aren't useful enough. We have the internet now.
The paper would only be used as a backup, incase my usual BTC payment method failed.
@_date: 2014-10-12 10:49:39
OMG I found the bear whale. You are here to say you did it to benevolently distribute BTC. And you go on to say you wanted to do it in a fashion that would benefit the protocol and provide a small reward to those who are buying in this time of declining prices. I tip my hat to you BBW (benevolent bear whale).
@_date: 2014-07-10 02:50:03
Your humour is showing.
@_date: 2014-08-17 00:31:24
Do your research, and over time you will see how useful it is, and why it is gaining so much attention from so many sectors. Ie economics, silicon valley and wall st, merchants, policymakers etc. The keyword here is useful.

Here is a very good comparison site.
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:56:34
Yeah, this looks similar. However rather than buying a predefined amount, the card could be sold with 0 btc, only holding the amount that you move to the address.
The usefulness is really the one use only scratch. (so someone cant find your phys wallet and take (using QR) the value without you knowing)

Do you want to frame it too?
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:51:22
Bitcoin is just a protocol, a standard 'language' that anything using it understands. Just like SMTP is to email. This means there can and should be many varied implementations out there. The equivalent in email terms would be Microsoft Exchange server, Lotus Notes and Gmail. All are separate software implementations using the same protocol to communicate, and if one had a problem, it doesn't affect any of the others, or the network itself. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:28:30
Whew, that was close!
@_date: 2017-02-26 05:40:14
I'm sick of this shit. THIS POLITICS IS NOT BITCOIN.  
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:30:51
Yeah, hope I see someone post "Kraken Up", when the time comes... :) 
@_date: 2017-02-14 10:28:33
No, you can't rule it out, which is why OP asked the question.
I'm just describing how a distributed system based on a  protocol, has the opportunity to avoid these types of issues, that may be found within a specific implementation.  
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:34:31
There are other cryptocurrencies who focus on privacy and fungibility in ways bitcoin can't, due to its architecture.
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:24:02
I think you mean "etc", "et al" is generally used for a list of names, i.e. authors etc.
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:41:18
This is good. Similar to the guy in the bar in Paris, who was able to have his mate in Miami buy a round of drinks for him.
Its amazing how flexible life using bitcoin is going to be; It is going to change the way we think about all levels of payments. 
Micropayments through to spaceships.
@_date: 2014-10-29 00:45:44
Don't get me wrong, I like bits. I think using 6000bits (xbt?) Is preferable to 0.0006BTC
The general population just can not perceive value as quickly when they have to process zeros to the right of the decimal.
It also helps with the 'But I can't afford 1BTC' problem.
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:54:37
Yep, Bitcoin for use by all businesses, no matter where they exist in their industry's life cycle.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:04:09
Yeah, I was referring to the "Best to avoid alts all together as the data indicates though--"
@_date: 2017-03-23 03:41:39
And there we go... The assumptions you make *right there* are exactly the reasons another code implementation exist in the first place
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:35:44
What if you want privacy and fungibility though?
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:24:21
I see progress. Hard fork and let blockchain Darwinism decide.
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:07:13
You mean non fungible, non private, censorable money? 
@_date: 2016-06-10 02:50:37
Onecoin!! That is a known ponzi scam. This guy is clueless.
@_date: 2017-01-15 02:40:06
They are only allowing it, as Bitcoin is far from being  anonymous. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:33:08
Zcash? Really?
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:25:45
Zcash isn't fungible at all. There is only one cryptocurrency that is 100% fungible.
@_date: 2017-01-31 08:04:31
Numbers 1, 3 and 4 are fantastic reasons to think about adding attributes such as stealth addresses, unlinkable addresses and untracable transactions, truly decentralized, and created by cryptographers who have a clue, and implemented by those without any ulterior motive. If only this was a real thing, I'd stock up...
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:52:41
Only one does. Monero.
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:16:38
No, it's not Bitcoin. Bitcoin will never be fungible.

@_date: 2016-11-04 19:45:57
Bitcoin is a long way from being anonymous 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:08:11
No it's not far. It's fungible, and it's the only one that is fungible.
@_date: 2016-11-15 03:17:15
Isn't the last word a checksum? So the finder of the 24 words, would only have to try 1600 or so words?
@_date: 2016-12-16 10:38:24
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER 
@_date: 2016-12-17 22:27:41
This is shit. If only there was a way to incorporate stealth addresses...

Put me down for BIP101
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:00:36
It's not random garbage, it's a check sum at the end of the address to ensure validation. They are burn addresses.
@_date: 2015-08-15 01:30:59
My body is ready... 
@_date: 2016-09-01 09:03:24
Exactly. What I'm referring to would be possible motivation for miners to do this, and any advantages for a  group of them to do this.
@_date: 2016-09-03 22:28:57
Agreed if there was one miner acting alone, It would be pointless. However if the top 20 bitcoin holders and all the dozen or so miners in the world held their bitcoin and colluded appropriately, they could effectively remove new coin base transactions, ensuring they continue to hold the majority of bitcoin. As long as they hold the majority of mining for a length of time (one or maybe two halvings?) they have proportionally more bitcoin than they would have had, and no one could do anything about it.

Ok cool. If privacy isn't needed, can you just post up (in clear text) the contents of your bank account and all transactions please? Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:31:46


It sure is worth pointing out. Anonymity/privacy in crypto is such a sleeping giant, and this is the only one that has implemented privacy in a way that truly works.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:57:28
"The Only 100% Untraceable Currency in the World." ummm, that would be Monero, not that Wraith crap.

Agreed, there is a lot of flow going to PnDs at the moment, but as usual this will eventually find its way to the boring, and currently unfashionable assets that have true use cases, aligned with mature development. M is the one I'm referring to.

@_date: 2017-06-29 03:04:23
Lol, no it doesn't. There is only one that does, and it isn't Zcash. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:28:57
Monero. It's privacy and fungibility features will easily make this worth more than the first coin, a distributed computing platform, or a bank to bank platform.
