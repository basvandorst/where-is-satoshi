We do not forgive, we do not forget. We are legion. We are bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:37:56

If you don't have a credit card or a debit card, you are like .00001% of the wikipedia userbase
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:58:59
no you are right, most functioning adults don't have a credit card.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:55:45
You think THIS is a big crash? You must be new here. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:46:25
Oops! I meant it will go above 100k this year and you can retire and this totally isnt a fucking scam.
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:45:28
lmao, well you will definitely get that wish.
@_date: 2014-08-31 14:55:16
IoT is the future for sure, there will never be a shortage of addresses though. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:09:37
so the money you made at the end of last year is now 1/3rd the value, must be nice.
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:05:20
They dont keep the bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-04-26 17:39:14

@_date: 2014-03-04 15:04:18
Ahhh gotcha, not relevant at all.
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:28:09

@_date: 2014-06-15 05:50:10
no one is even sure how it works.
@_date: 2014-09-28 06:03:24
lets just use the useful version above instead.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:16:53
yeah but idiots will believe him, which is the entire point of anyone in these threads screaming "this is good news! buy guys!"
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:54:40

@_date: 2014-08-18 15:51:24
It's actually a good thing!
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:21:42
I guess I'm just not understanding the core concept here.
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:22:50
How is that relevant?
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:19:28
Wear your fedora a little harder bud.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:52:49
Why would you move from mining doge or lite to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:33:51
because porn was once again pushing the cutting edge, digital distribution.

This guy drank starbucks and that means he is a fat fuck pig and barely human.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:01:01
Its never been better than this.
@_date: 2014-05-04 00:04:31

@_date: 2014-03-08 22:28:25
but there aren't thousands.
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:23:05
This is actually a good thing!
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:35:52
WTF guys? Its not propaganda if its true, its activism. Wtf is with all these fuckheads coming into the and spreading this bullshit about how cringey and preachy it is to talk to people about Jesus.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:26:35
literally dozens of us!

If people want to give their cash away in comments, i'll be glad to take it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:25:11
It's a ton of excitement sure, but it'll die down soon. What's more exciting is how much everyone is talking about it again outside of this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:17:26
Evacuate all the school children?

@_date: 2013-12-28 15:48:28
Dat cringe
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:55:11
I've been tipped a bunch, really generous community.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:12:39
Wow this looks great!  How long was the process from becoming interested in using bitcoin to integrating bitcoin into your system?
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:35:54
That is so cool, how are you doing that? I don't know much about bitcoins, but how are you getting it to his wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:12:41
oh geez, I didnt know any of that. so basically I should get bitcoin-qt and transfer my coins to that offline wallet huh?
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:41:20
Yeah it still works, but I also have Like 6 reddit accounts for doing it. Anytime someone tips just make a comment like "wow did you just give him actual money?" And there's like a 25% chance they or someone else will tip you and say "yeah try it yourself". It's just too easy to ignore. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:56:05
Wow that's really generous. Its like reddit gold, but useful lol.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:05:43
Can someone explain to me how buying with bitcoin works? People say you just scan a QRcode with your address and its done. Where is the protection in that, can't anyone get your address and just start buying whatever with it.
Sorry, totally new to this.

Hold on to your fedora.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:43:32
I'm hoping there's a dip soon so I can get into the market.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:54:25
How many mili bitcoins to the bitcoin? How many micro bitcoins to the bitcoin? How the fuck do magnets works?
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:40:15
I have only seen one gas station that charges for credit card payment, it's right next to my house and I only made the mistake of going there once.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:44:01
If I'm using something like coinbase, do I have a private key?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:56:13
Its not not commonly known in the states. Everyone knows how to use SI measurements.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:27:37
I love fees.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:44:14
I made my first 200 bucks in bitcoin by acting like I didn't know what btctip was.
