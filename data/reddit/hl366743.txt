Erroneous specifics inside the content but when corrected now, the conclusion remains the same.  Now what?
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:49:29
Why do you guys always sound like angry, low IQ children? Everything that comes out of your mouths sounds like a bully on a playground. 
Is that because you have nothing technical or intelligent to back up your positions? Because that’s how it seems.
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:52:55
The fact that you consider that a positive is ridiculous.

Guess I’m an idiot then. I sent $56,000 in BTC today and the “economy” option (cheapest) offered by Breadwallet cost me $360 in fees.  
I used to be able to send amounts like this for $0.05 USD.

Same.  Literally been waiting over 4 weeks.

This is exactly why every bitcoin ATM company has already added Bitcoin Cash support:
BTC was no longer feasible for ATMs because of network fees and slowness.  They had to keep increasing their markup and nobody was using the machines anymore.

Lulz. Are you twelve?

Can you clarify how that solves the problem of needing withdrawal limits raised, and GDX support team not responding to the request?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:30:08
Yup.  That’s what we were told to believe.  And look at the price.  Below $9,990 now.  What is going wrong?  I thought everything would be fine again.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:31:06


What would come out of your mouth if you didn’t have idiotic childish name-calling as an option? Grow up.

I’d never rely on software / app staying in existence. Paper FTW.

You congratulated the guy for getting him upset.  Why are you so negative and horrible? This has nothing to do with your weird obsession with that other coin.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:47:42


Weird.  How about not being insane, and instead understanding the technical merits of both viewpoints?  
I realize that evolutionary incentives make human beings “need“ to be part of a group. So they live and die by the group viewpoint, and all other groups are “enemies“. 
But we don’t live in caves anymore. And your life isn’t it risk. So you can actually take a more rational, moderate position on things. 
Lightning network is going to serve a purpose and I pray that it gets adopted like crazy! 
But I also fully understand why people are upset and why they forked. Do you pride yourself on being an intelligent, rational person? 
Then try this approach sometime. You will garner a lot more respect from those who listen to you speak.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:46:55
Correct.  And that’s primarily what motivated the fork. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:28:11
So they corrected some contextual errors, but still came to the same conclusion as before? That Bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin?

Your bank has only one branch on earth?  I’ve had my stash in multiple branch locations even in the event of a regional catastrophe.  Road trip?

Some of the most simple, cool, common sense things they could add to phones... they never have, and probably never will. :(
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:45:43
Grow up. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:48:20
No I’m a real person who is clearly more mature than you and has a difference of opinion.  Deal with it. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:58:03


What’s it like having an IQ so low that this is all you can come up with?   
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:53:29
What exactly are they “doing with BCH“? Every time I hear that I think “what the hell are people talking about?”
I’ve watched literally every second of this entire thing for years. They’re not “doing” anything with it. They have a difference of opinion on how things should scale. They have a difference of opinion on whether things will be centralized using their method. 
So what exactly are they “doing“ that you hate so much? Nothing. They are literally doing nothing. 
He rubs you the wrong way. That’s fine. He’s awkward to look at. Granted. He says awkward things in videos. He has a weird, high-pitched voice.  He can sound annoying.  
The rest? Just seems like complete nonsense. There are a couple groups/races of people in humanity that were said to fit the above description as well. And they were put into ovens for being “different“ 
So that the true reason you’re so mad? Because he annoys you? Be careful with that...

You’d be amazed the power self-fulfilling prophesies can have.
