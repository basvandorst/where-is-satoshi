Guys I think the best moment to buy was in 2009 and the best moment to sell was at the ath! 
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:53:48
Does it though? I mean they'd be doing something wrong they'd also be getting toxic energy directed at them lol
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:00:35
how is it miniscule? We don't even know how many coins are lost. I'd guess they're at least equal but it's just a guess

I paid 30 sat/Byte and had to wait 1.5 months 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:30:48
I'm not sure if what I'm saying is right but don't you have to pay a third party to controll your LN balance to make sure nobody is trying to steal it? (If you dont want to do it yourself which has a few requirements)
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:23:43
Well OP is comparing it to bch which has fees lower than a cent.
And my bank doesn't have transaction fees

let it go, people here are obsessed in what you can and can't call bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:45:03
Making the size of the Blockchain larger would not be an issue at all, this is misinformation. The problem is bandwidth. I still would sacrifice some nodes with a Blocksize increase as a bandaid for the time it'll take to implement LN. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:12:10
Why would they need to change it to fiat if it is widespread? they'd be able to buy everything with crypto (that is the dream atleast)
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:20:49
M.A.P.S. 
They have a Bitcoin address already set up.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:17:17
I mean we had Bitcoin before
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:59:36
That's correct, people were mining. But they weren't building dedicated mining pcs (at least not for profit). Remember the first recorded use of Bitcoin was the dude that bought 2 pizzas for 10k btc in March 2010

@_date: 2017-12-19 13:29:14
so you are willing to accept &gt;$50+ fees? not right now but if bitcoin gets more exposure and price climbs higher that's a possibility. And then people might jump to more functional cryptos... One month ago people were saying if you want to pay low fees, then you'll have to wait. Now that does already not work anymore. I have a $5 txs pending for over a week
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:49:24
What do you mean? Bitcoin has many mobile wallets...
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:46:32
It's not about the fees you pay to the exchange, it's about the fees you pay for doing a Bitcoin transaction

It is not as I wasn't saying that this specific crypto will take over but showing that scaling solutions exist already.
I'm just talking about scalability and premining coins has nothing to do with it 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:12:21
Holy shit yes. As soon as you mention something about an altcoin your post gets removed. You talk about how bad bch or roger is and you get to the front page.

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:58:33
Not a Bitcoin cash fan but they could transfer 500k with 1 cent fee right now, so with that sentence they'd have a point.

Are you mentally challenged? Bitcoin was below 1k this year
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:28:28
Not sure if lying or you got the date wrong... There were no people building mining pcs in 09 lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:21:57
Imagine you invested in MySpace, then Facebook came around.
It wouldn't turn to 0 overnight (maybe not to 0 at all) but what if eth becomes number one after Bitcoin not being able to scale? Some sort of flippening. Everything can happen.
Just because Bitcoin may fail doesn't mean crypto/Blockchain will fail.
That being said, for me btc is still number 1. You still have to be careful though. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:53:49
Please explain what you meant, what do you mean with price should jive with hash power? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:14:25
Just no. Why don't you invest in a new crypto then? Nobody can see the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:59:03
I don't get what your point is. I know if all chinese miners would stop mining at once we would have a problem until difficulty decreased. But you could say that about everything. And it's not like it's just one person mining in china, it's just that mining in china is more profitable due to the electricity cost
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:33:30
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:55:42
It was just an example, no need to discuss the way they distributed the coins. All I'm saying is there are alternatives you should be looking out for!
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:24:15
But what if you did and btc would have gone to 0? Then it would have been a missed opportunity not to invest in the crypto that took it's place. Hindsight is 2020

He had one strong argument though and people that have been here longer might agree... Many things we used to advertise Bitcoin with are gone...
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:39:41
Yeah but when Bitcoin came out nobody new it would become so big. So you probably would not have invested. Like the thousand other cryptos right now.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:13:58
I've heard it called Bitcoint a few times. Seems to be a German thing...

GPU mining started early 2010 IIRC... I don't think people were building mining rigs for a worthless token in 2009. Remember in march 2010 10k btc got you 2 pizzas
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:56:54
That's a nice perspective indeed. Still I don't think doubling blocksize will make Bitcoin non censorship resistant.
I believe in LN but am concerned about the time we'll need to get there :(
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:04:34
Why is that? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:33:10
It's the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:32:02
Not necessarily 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:10:27
You seem to be rather new in the crypto game based on what you are saying. I hope you are aware that we are going through a crypto bubble right now as everyone is trying to get rich quickly. It's not going to last and just a fraction of the cryptos will survive.
And it's funny that you value a coin based on 2-4 weeks of performance
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:37:07
Still don't really get it lol. The hash power has no connection at all to the fees...
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:02:13
What? How long have you been in Bitcoin? It popped many times. Just because it recovered doesn't mean it never happened. Stocks and house market also recovered from the bubbles...
Right now this feels a lot like a bubble, especially since we have so many people that don't have a clue what the Blockchain is trying to invest. I'm not kidding I've had about 10 people asking me how to buy cryptos in the last 2 weeks many didn't even know what a Bitcoin address is.
Normally that's a clear sign of a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:05:41
That's something different yes.
What I'm talking about are the fees to make a normal Bitcoin transaction. If I'm sending someone money with Bitcoin I have to add a transaction fee. If you want to have it confirmed right now you will have to pay around $20
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:50:10

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:58:14
Segwit is definitely not the solution either. It will help though. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:13:15
Yes but since fees are bigger than the last 4 decimal places its kinda useless 
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:38:05
It was an example. I don't follow eth... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:13
I know. But sometimes I do wonder if increasing block size as a bandaid until we have 2nd layer solutions would help the adoption of btc... 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:33:06
This is how Bitcoin works though. They wanted another scaling solution and we told them to fork. They did it. Now let's shut up already. We all want the same thing.
And regarding Bitcoin.com, well unlucky for us that he got that domain. We can't do anything about it though, so let's just relax and do our thing.
This entire fight causes way more confusion than bitcoin.com
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:28:11
Actually we have that (coinbase and bitpay) it's just Bitcoin that isn't usable right now
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:24:44
I'd say none. Just like segwit, people will need to adapt the technology for it to really make a difference.
LN also will only help with the fees when you have recurring txs between parties. If you just want to buy something online, it won't really help (except if you buy there weekly for example). And if you do that, the service will be like a gift card. You put 50 dollar in your Amazon LN account and can only use it there. You can cash out the unused funds anytime though. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:51:06
Except many do have access to the internet and have smartphones. Unbanked doesn't mean that they live in a cave 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:07:20
Once we get there there might be better coins that already took bitcoins place
Have a look at RaiBlocks for example, already solved scalability :/
fun fact: wanted to buy $250 worth when they were 50 cent each, btc tx with $5 fees is still in mempool and they now are worth about $3 lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:45:05
It was distributed via captchas for free instead of being sold like all other cryptos (ICOs)
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:45:35
are you serious? you never got pissed off in you life?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:14:44
There are addresses with a 3 that are not segwit 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:06:43
I disagree.
Bitcoin should be used as a currency, that's what it's meant to be. Otherwise what's the point of all this? We want to see it as an option besides PayPal and bank transfers everywhere.
Also while yes, increasing the blocksize will never be the solution, I think doubling the 1mb we have right now would help immensely keep the txs fees lower until lightning is the norm.
That's my take on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:44:45
Doubling the amount would certainly make a noticeable difference for the next months. It's not a permanent solution though
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:06:38
I also don't think LN would solve this. Maybe if your local supermarket accepted btc it would work but not for one time online purchases 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:28:02
Fuck these shitposts seriously. Are we in kindergardern or what? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:17:56

@_date: 2017-12-31 04:26:04
Bitcoin has no use for us in the first world... It will be revolutionary for unbanked people though. That is if LN is a success. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:07:16
Fuck me. Will it be available in Germany again soon? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:58:28
Can't open the link right now but I assume it's lightning network. Yes it will be very helpful, but will take a lot of time to get released and implemented just like segwit...
I'm not looking forward to the months of waiting with 10€+  transactions... 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:43:34
I mean, if Bitcoin becomes the crypto winner (and that is a big if), it will be worth at least 1 million in 5-10 years. So that would make it smart money now.
If it doesn't it'll probably be worthless.

The best thing about bitcoin for me was always helping the unbanked and poorer people on the world. Being able to send them money for practically nothing.
That's all not possible anymore. 
Seriously I'm kinda wishing this bubble to burst bad. So the same scenario occurs like in 2013. People lost interest very quickly. That way we might see less traffic and give us more time

well the blocks would be 2mb (but with SW capacity like it was a 4mb block)
Also there are more than double eth nodes compared to btc. And ETH's blockchain is way bigger than BTC's so I asume it uses more bandwidth.

@_date: 2017-08-12 18:49:42
you are expressing my concerns perfectly. IMO you are exactly right. 
I feel like there are not many companies helping spreading bitcoin like they used to. Bitpay was revolutionary. I remember when many stores started accepting btc but that kinda declined... Now the money goes to exchanges and ICOs. It's not about the revolutionary technology but more about speculation and profits.
Also people don't seem to realize that deflation can be very damaging to the economy just like inflation...
The end goal for me should be that btc is widely spread around the world, like paypal/cc payments but not replacing national currencies :)

If you spend btc it helps the community grow though. Why don't you put a small amount of dollars in btc each month and use it to order pizza, buy steam games etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:04:36
Not really. You don't see the transaction costs when you are the customer. If you go to an online shop and buy shoes for 30 euro, you will be paying exactly that amount with any payment method. And if you pay with Bitcoin you probably pay the 30 euro plus transaction fees... 
That's just the reality right now, at least here in my country. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:11:13
You don't have to be a big blocker to speak out against the transaction fee problem. 
I am in favor of segwit and decentralized 2nd layer solutions.
I also wouldn't mind increasing the block size by a factor of 2 or 4 in the future. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:14:25
what? I'm all for it being used as currency!
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:03:41
Whats the difference between LTC and BTC? Here everybody says 2mb blocks would be devastating for bitcoin while LTC has basically 4mb blocks (1mb blocks every 2.5min) and it works fine...
I'm all for segwit but don't understand why everybody has such a big problem with 2x... Is it the HF or is it the blocksize increase itself?
I know SW will double the capacity of txs but we are already hitting the current capacity. with a blocksize increase + sw we would have 4 times the capacity of today. I think heaving a bigger headroom is better for development of future bitcoin payment applications.
I'm still a noob when it comes to the technical aspect of btc and blockchain technology, so please correct me if my logic is flawed!

@_date: 2017-08-26 02:59:44
"Why aren't people who are just interested in lower fees using a coin like Dogecoin?"
Because almost nobody accepts cryptos but Bitcoin. 
"They are not interested in just low fees. They are interested in using bitcoin with low fees." 
Of course they are, who wouldn't be? I don't want to pay 4€ extra when buying a 10€ game on steam... 
"They don't see, or want to see, why people are paying these fees for using bitcoin" 
They pay high fees because they don't really have a choice. If they need to move btc they'll have to pay.

@_date: 2017-11-12 13:14:18
I totally agree, though 16mb would be too much. Just doubling it to 2mb or even 4mb would change so much for the short term and give them headroom to develop 2nd layer solutions... We might lose a few nodes, yes, but I would still call it decentralized. I'd rather have a working Bitcoin than thousands raspery pi nodes and 10$ fees :(
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:34:33
well yes it was 46mb because thousands of people were trying to move coins (many people selling and buying) and because we were mining a block every 40 minutes.
I know there has been spam in the past and probably right now aswell but a large part of the backlogs are users
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:28:52
well, many of those techs are not available yet and expecting everyone to adopt SW is a bit unrealistic for now...

@_date: 2017-11-17 16:44:12
How much did you have? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:34:44
The problem is we have no 2nd layer solutions that are ready to be used... I think increasing the blocksize to 2MB might give us some headroom and a bit more resistance against transaction spam (filling blocks and keeping txs fees high will double in cost). Hopefully we have LN, etc up and running by the point 2MB is not enough

@_date: 2017-11-12 13:21:50
I wouldn't be so sure...
If Roger and his frineds manage to dump their BTC for BCH in the next 9 hours and the prices of both coin reach parity, we'll have a problem. If BCH is more profitable to mine after the mining difficulty change, we could be fucked...
And if BCH became more valuable than BTC, I don't think people would just sell their BCH instantly...

Isn't it possible to send a fake transaction or something like that?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:48:02
Increasing blocksize to 2mb would change so much imo. I think we need it since 2nd layer solutions are taking so long. I also don't think 2mb block would jeopardize the decentralized nature of btc.
Transaction cost got out of hand, I used to get BTC for random purchases like steam, but it just isn't viable anymore...
I hope core can start talking to us about a proposal on increasing the blocksize

You should inform yourself a bit more on this. HDD space was never an issue. The bandwidth is the problem.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:22:02
I'm not talking about trading sites. I'm talking about bitcoin.de for example where you directly buy (or sell) using bank transfers which is not trading.
You sound like a kid to be honest. Nobody knows the prefect time to buy/sell Bitcoin. But if we look in the past, prices rising like this ended in big crashes. Nothing wrong in cashing out right now when it might drop 30% tomorrow.
You probably don't have 6 figures invested in btc like these guys so you might not understand.
Also many people probably said I'm cashing out when btc hits 10k when they invested 
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:14:09
It's still one more layer of anonymity. If you encrypt your address and LE busts a market, they could still track the btc (if you didn't tumble)

While yes we have more capacity, many people at that time tried to avoid sending btc due to the high fees (like myself)
We can't really say what would happen if we had a situation like in December.
We are making good progress but I am kinda annoyed by people bragging about TX fees we have RIGHT NOW when it was practically unusable 3 months ago.
Let's be honest here, the biggest reason we have low TX fees right now is the Bitcoin/crypto hype "dying"/going down. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:48:03

And he is right, why the fuck are we still talking about roger? Let them do their own thing! You sound like people complaining about their ex every day.
The worst thing is people using the current tx fees as an argument for Bitcoin, when in reality if we start seeing traffic like in December it'll go to shit again in no time. So instead of bragging about an issue we have yet to solve, we should put the energy in actually solving it.

Why would you have needed to sell, I don't get it. Why do you care if the price goes down if your plan is to hold for a long time? Also the subreddit doesn't seem very bipolar to me, maybe just a few new users. Most don't really care if the price goes down by a few 100 dollars and you shouldn't either. And always invest only what you can afford to lose.

You just gave yourself an argument on why drugs should be legal. In the black market you don't always know what you are getting and how strong the stuff is. Those things wouldn't be a problem if you could buy them at the pharmacy.

Nope. (at least for the last 1-1.5 years the site existed)

I think he meant accidentally the low transaction fee

Oh sorry. I looked if the direkt link was posted but it showed me only a post from 1 year ago...
Was probably posted by other guys that also had a remind me request

You should ban fast food then. Probably causing waaaay more damage than drugs!

Couldn't you just recover the coins on another wallet with the mnemonic? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:49:21
They work perfectly until there is another price rally and media attention. Then thousands of new people want to register and need to be verified etc. Often they don't have enough resources to go through this smoothly and a backlog of support requests and transactions are the result.

Some say he might have been tortured and then killed. The official story is that he had all his login info in a simple text file. That doesn't sound right for a person running the biggest darknet market in history... 
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:22:38
Market cap is not the movement of coins. It's the price multiplied with the amount of coins that has been mined. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:14:27
Depends, if that was like 10% of his investment I might have done it too 
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:30:28
Yeah but are all AB addresses stored in a list or what. How does the bank know which address belongs to alpha...

Mycelium app. There are local traders for face to face sales. If you are buying small amounts it comes with a premium though...

The problem is, sending 5€ could also cost 1,80€. Also inside the EU I can transfer money for free.

Why buy anything with $ if you could exchange for BTC and wait for it to be more valuable?
Its the same thing.

@_date: 2017-06-18 08:16:36
I don't understand, can't you just look in the Blockchain for addresses with btc in them? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:10:37
that would bet $10k/BTC
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:22:38
more than 99.9% of the addresses have 0BTC
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:17:23
aaaaand it's at 300 again...
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:32:32
wow, actually a very good article!
they didn't even mention silk road!
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:50:34
Prices went nuts. on bitcoin.de they went up to 495€ (~$660) which is insane, since prices are always much higher on gox (which had $605 ath at that moment)
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:33:17
Nice! when you do so please post a picture of the sandwich!

One kilogram of gold is about 30k€ and some countries have tons (literally)

go to the receive tab (or whatever it's called in english) on the left from your send tab
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:01:40
why is germany so far up the list?

why the fuck dont you upvote?
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:15:39
I also don't trade them but you can just store (even if it's a small fraction)  them and wait
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:00:55
this needs more upvotes
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:03:09
bitcoin.de is pretty good IMO nothing wrong with the verification system.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:08:46
when you are sent a bitcointip you will receive a message from and you will be able to send the money to your own address. If you want to set it up so that you can tip others go to and look on the sidebar. the process is fast and easy
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:01:44
if you go to blockchain.info there are much more than 1 transaction per second 
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:44:54
how much did you make? :D
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:51:33
i think it has a scanner and you scan your qr code
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:17:42
Great info, thanks!
I hope this works, first attempt at tipping
+$1 verify
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:11:30
yeah I know haha, I was just trying to call him out on an error :P
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:11:36
this cant be true... so every 50 adresses you generate one will contain at least 1 coin on average?
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:55:39
Calm down dude. We get it you are upset. Also a solution would be to just move out of the USA. Germany seems to have no problems with bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:24:52
And now 560$+
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:13:00
why are you not ready to bring it up?
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:49:07
they get transaction fees
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:56:55
germany is a great place :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:22:41
bitcoin.de ftw
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:52:23
ahh you are new to bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:12:57
did you get something out of it?
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:34:13
too many people trying to get cheap coins. it might crash but not that far (but what do I know). [Also since this happened]( many people will use this opportunity to sell high but also a lot of people will be motivated to buy coins... 
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:00:25
holy shit 0.005 btc is almost 2$
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:49:20
not worth it
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:11:50
well there is a guy buying 730 BTC, that's whats happening...
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:20:19
worst article about btc i've ever read
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:48:26
what exactly is signing a transaction?
@_date: 2013-10-19 14:53:49
I also have 2 bitcoins :)
I'm thinking about investing 50€ per month in btc
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:04:14
I love how nobody knows wtf is going on
@_date: 2013-10-19 16:13:17
That would be a smart thing to do, but I think i'll keep my 2 coins and hold onto them as long as i can :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 12:03:52
Doesn't help if you get a keylogger :/
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:23:56
Why sell everything? Keep one coin it could be worth more than those 10k$ some day :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:22:46
how do you convert comment karma? :O
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:35:40
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:08:25
if yes, then tomorrow would be a good time to buy in
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:53:32
I know that... But is it me or did the guy i replied to comment something confusing?
what does he mean with 30% of the addresses have coins in them?
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:51:55
we've come very far
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:43:18
i thought their government was embracing it?
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:46:11
if you have few bitcoins and no money to buy more, dont spend them. I really like when people spend bitcoins but your best bet is just to hold on to them
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:33:25
No, 0.001
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:39:37
you could have bought for $500, now they are $515 ;)
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:33:58
can you explain the last point please?
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:07:05
and 300 again
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:14:16
yeah but that's not correct.
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:30:49
if you are insecure just put out what you invested, when it hits 666$. so that no matter what happens you didnt lose money. Also instead of cashing out try to find stuff that you'd like to buy and pay in bitcoins if possible
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:16:28
Bitcoin.de is what I use. Very professional
