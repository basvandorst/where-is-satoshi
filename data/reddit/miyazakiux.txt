They would create their own new crypto currency not use bitcoin duhhhh.

Just a little. Life is more than money. I think those kinds of opportunities still exist even now if we know where to look.

Go ahead and stoke your ego monkey. I said nothing about myself so I'm not sure why you feel the need to turn this into a personal attack. I'm from the states and have been all over Japan in all sorts of situations. Yes I live in rural Japan at the moment but I do have a grasp at the vibe in this country and it's not one of fast advancements. Japan is a "don't rock the boat" type of place. Sure, there is new tech and crowds who adopt it but the vast majority of the country including Tokyo will not be setting up any mesh nets or doing any bitcoin trading en masse. 
Everything I said was from personal experience. Japan is still in large a cash based society and I don't see that changing for several decades. Yes, people use atms yes they use cards but you have to look at the broad spectrum before forming your responses based on your personal knowledge and use of tech. 
Part of the problem with crypto currency is that it's so complex and difficult to use for an average person, Japan or elsewhere. I work as a UX designer and let me tell you, people are a lot less savvy than most tech minded people are led to believe. Unless we get some major improvements in the UX of crypto currencies we are in for a slow adoption, especially in this country.

Let me take a dump on all the excitement coming out of Japan... bitcoin is not going mainstream any time soon because we have way too many old people here who don't even use credit or debit cards. Hell, we have people who don't even know how to use ATMs. 
The young hip crowd in Tokyo may be first to jump on the bitcoin train but the next stop is decades away. How many decades? As long as it takes 2 generations to die off.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:52:43
I see, great example, thanks!

Private enterprise is already working with their own private block chains and it's not unheard of govt reaching out to less honorable startups To do their bidding. So it's a very realistic assumption.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:42:32
Gave me a chuckle. Ty
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:57:46
Could you explain why that made you take a loss? Would you have set a lower buy price on a limit order? Is buying market stupid? Serious questions. Thanks.

Maybe they make more on trading fees and could care less about transfers going out? I don't know... I found that very odd too.

I think that's just new money pouring in and naturally the average folk care about ROI. The hardcore bitcoiners are still here and we still care about the tech and the fiat-less future.
I know this may seem ironic coming from someone who just posted about the value of bitcoin in 18 years but I would be equally happy if bitcoin went mainstream and replaced global currencies. 
I have a feeling it would take more than 18 years for that to happen and we'd need to see major economic collapse for people to lose faith in fiat.

He'll have plenty of that along with traditional college savings. This is more or less a fun experiment in crypto.

Let's not praise a bank for shady practices eh?
"On November 19, 2013, the Justice Department announced that JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $13 billion to settle investigations into its business practices pertaining to mortgage-backed securities."
- Wikipedia 
When banks break the law it's a-ok and when their CEO bashes disruptive tech we are supposed to just take their word for it? Me thinks not.

You're just proving bitcoins value as an investment vehicle vs actual currency use. Case closed.
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:29:08
Guy sounds like a fucking idiot. Lollll gfy
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:06:24
The problem with any model that focuses on currency in the freelance world is that it focuses on currency. Ask any successful freelancer and they'll tell you this is a bad idea. Any time you commoditize a service you become just another cog in a global pool of talent. This may be ok for inexperienced folks who don't mind charging by the hour, but for those of us who charge by value-based contributions, the focus on currency devalues our services. When you start accepting crypto currency where it has to be converted to fiat to be useful at the end of the day, you inadvertently put focus on math, calculation and figuring out how much something costs vs the value you get out of that service.
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:02:53
All of my points still stand:
1. Accepting crypto currency as a freelancer automatically shifts focus to price.
2. Fluctuating nature of current investment apparatus of bitcoin makes for unreliable payment in a world with real fixed costs.
I'm a nonbeliever, probably somewhat of a rarity in these threads and I don't care if I get downvoted to hell. I honestly don't think bitcoin will work as currency UNTIL there is mass adoption. I'm talking whole countries using it. Sadly I don't see how this will ever come to pass. The tech is not positioned to be mass adopted. Now, I'm not saying changes could not make it adaptable or that block chain tech won't develop into good use cases - we already see some of that now. Just as it stands now there is no reason average Joe should accept bitcoin over fiat.

Unfortunately with the way bitcoin fluctuates I wouldn't be putting any food in my mouth. Let me go ask my landlord if she'd like 1100 this month or 900...
