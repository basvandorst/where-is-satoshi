I personally believe it has yet to even reach enough exposure to have a good assessment of the value that people see in it. With 10k hitting many people are talking about it on youtube, news, and tv. Also there have been big companies getting involved such as steam accepting bitcoin and amazon buying domains. These companies will not simply let bitcoin die when they invest so much in it. Again these are my personal beliefs on the value of coin making it personally worthwhile for me to still be involved.
Everyone wants it to go higher and higher, but also recognize that we hit 10k. That already is an absurd amount. It can fly quite literally to the moon, but also fall like a rock.
TL:DR - Yes.

Mining bitcoin no, you will need an ASIC and will be competing against super computers and companies pouring millions to mine.
There are other coins that are easier/meant to be mined by more "regular" people, however, whether it is profitable or not depends highly on factors specific to you such as electricity cost, how powerful your comp is and how often you mine or plan to before you turn a profit.
For pure profit investing is the best way.

Read into the technology, read into why it reached to 10k in the first place. Then assess the value you think it has for yourself. Think about the exposure it has, the application you see in it in the world. Do you think more companies will be on board? Do you think it is being used at a scale you think is attainable? Do you think it actually makes the concept of money easier and an improvement from current dollars? Depending on how you answer these and other similar questions determines whether it is worthwhile for you to invest now or not at all.
