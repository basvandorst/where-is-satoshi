For-profit companies operate within the limits of whatever-the-hell they can get away with.  When I ordered mine, I knew my profitability would be entirely dependent on future growth of BTC exchange rates.  My main worry was that I would never actually get what I paid for, and to my relief they delivered my order.  The calculator says it will be 6 to 8 months before they pay for themselves (assuming increased difficulty and current exchange rates). 
 I wanted to have mining operations, and I have it.  
 I'm confident BFL will send me more mining hardware if I can't find a better option, and I will pay with dollars.  At some point in the future they may be forced to improve the customer experience, but right now they're probably more worried about how to handle the massive profits.
I agree with you, they should refund some of those 5 BitCoins, adjusting the price to the exchange rate at the time of shipping, but I doubt they will.  They might double their preorders if they guaranteed some kind of future price adjustment based on mining difficulty and BTC exchange rates at the time of shipping, but they don't need to double their preorders.  I would bet a BitCoin that they're sold out on the new products through 2014.

I know the 'pre-order' will take forever, but there have been various reviews and verified posts that show some shipped units, so I'm not worried.  Someday may be as soon as a couple few (maybe more) months from now.

Yep.  Every day matters.  I was just saying that I understand 'queues' and that I don't feel exceptionally entitled to a higher position in the queue.

They tell you that you're paying for a place on a waiting list.

I've spent a lot of time trying to find a better option.  On paper that 600Gh/s card looks awesome.  What should I buy?
