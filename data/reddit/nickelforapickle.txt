Not that it's my favorite sub, but they are overly critical where this sub labels most criticism as FUD or makes some other rationalization. Here, a good point is made.

Eh, misguided, thoughtless enthusiasm, but I guess 'spam' works.

In general, I agree, but once trust in bitcoin starts to dwindle because the market is clearly being played and super volatile, there will be TONS of opportunity pouring into alts.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:14:24
Got a public opinion on which alts you consider 'insanely valued'?

It's a way to speed up transactions and lower fees, but also dangerously walks the line between keeping bitcoin decentralized or not..

Source? Or more speculation?

Consider at these three trends and tell me that doesn't sound realistic:
- Near endless printing of USD
- Rising level of US Government Debt
- Increasing incompetence when it comes to effective government at a federal level

lol. I think that's what the big money holders who wanted to make a quick buck WANTED everyone to think.

Talk about painting a literal target on your forehead. Imagine continuing to get mugged and beat up when you've already lost all your bitcoin by getting robbed. LOL

In crypto, wallets are the same as bank accounts. Exchanges are not.

Knowing that if they hold onto it through the bull run makes more sense than the normal "sell it to recoop costs"

I'm not familiar with what OTC means I'm this context. 
My thinking is that miners understand the supply and demand effects enough to have incentive to hold around the time of a halving.

Lol, Binance goes over $7k while coinbase sits at $6600...
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:27:27
On his twitter he has another post where he says BTC will never go down below $6250:

And they likely aren't paying their overhead with BTC either.
@_date: 2018-10-15 05:49:21
The news is that this market sucks and is stressful. You're welcome.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:09:08
It did jump from just over 6340 to 7600 on Binance.

I admit, this would be operating under an assumption that either most Bitcoin that is mined winds up getting sold near immediately, combined with whatever amount of Bitcoin will not be sold by holders due to their understanding of supply and demand.. 
So, yeah: I can't quite claim it's a fact like I did in my title, but I still think it holds true.
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:31:16
The main part of the bull run, yes, but if you look at the time to halving x price charts, the price does start to rise in the 6 months before the halving as well. Just only bit a little bit.
@_date: 2019-10-27 05:09:52
Also very relevant is:
Bitcoin miners make money by selling their block rewards. The market can count on a certain amount of relatively consistent selling pressure to exist from these miners. Each time the mining reward halves, that 'relatively consistent selling pressure' is also cut in half.
When the miners know that 'soon, there will be less to sell, and that means the market will drive the price up,' they have less incentive to sell their Bitcoin, in order to hold out for a time in the near future when they can get more USD for their BTC. This would happen just before the halving, assuming it leads right into a bull run.

So can you not use a credit card on GDAX?
@_date: 2019-10-31 21:11:49
I think most smart miners would hold on to way more of their Bitcoin near the time of the halving.

It's an online retail shop. I would be fine using the QR code to request money in an email, but I'd still like a way to just accept it on my site.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:09:11
Yes... I know lol. I just don't want to move my entire backend for just one feature.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:47:20
I think there are a bunch of confused sideline investors waiting to jump on the train right now, but just realizing how anti fragile this currency is. Unless I'm just reading into all the hype and noise, that is. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:36:09
I'm interested to see just how low the first futures market-caused dip will actually go..
