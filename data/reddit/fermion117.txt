Dude seriously get a couple ledgers and a few metallic back ups for the seed phrase [ 
If you don't do that you're still irresponsible. Last thing you need is for price to hit $33k when you're not looking and your wife leaves the stove on.

I hope you're talking about bitconnect 2

After the next bill run the goal will be to accumulate 0.1 BTC. Aim for that instead. If BTC can capture even a half decent chunk of the world economy you'll still be in the clear.

You should also invest in a mind wallet

No you won't. You're fomo-ing in. 11/10 you'll sell at the first -10% dip because you invested more than you can lose. That or you leveraged 1000x. Crypto will make you suffer.

The whole point of disruptive tech is to disrupt. Otherwise they'd just be old people tech and laws would have no reason to change.

There are no safe places. Only real safe place is in your mind. A mind wallet. Or until you get dementia or axed.

Lol probably sodl for the license plate and not the car
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:31:07
If you got some BTC that you don't believe in then I'll trade you some xrp for it! That's defs going to the moon!! Probably even pluto
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:56:04
Anon please look into a cryptosteel type of wallet to prevent fire/water loss. Still won't stop it from being stolen. Mind wallet is the ultimate protection... until someone threatens to make you live the monotesticular life
