Nah, he already has his original investment back when BTC recovers to somewhere between 14k-15k, so the gamble was a good one, and all further increases can be considered as higher profits.

It will always rebound!
... until it doesn’t.

Years of training to achieve this level of analysis.

HODL is just as much of a gamble though, because the continuous increases are pretty irrational as well. So if everyone is in it for the gamble, it doesn’t hurt to be a tad greedier.

Nothing is certain.
People tend to be convinced Bitcoin will always recover &gt;100% after a (massive) drop, but the reality is such a statement is just as much of a gamble as any other. It might, and it might not. 
Despite the potential of the technology for the future, the majority of the people are just speculating on other’s gambling. It’s precisely that gambling that is responsible for the impressive increases we’ve seen - not the (potential of the) technology (although you could argue that it’s the potential that drove people to buy massively, I’m guessing that’s not the case for the majority of the buyers).
Your bet is that after a massive crash (should that ever come), the amount of people buying in low will make up for the crash entirely. I’m not daring to bet on this one. Just because it happened in the past doesn’t mean it’s going to happen again. The psychological effects of a next “correction” will be on a much larger scale than the previous ones, so to me it seems like it could go any way (and both outcomes would make sense).
The truth is Bitcoin has society-changing potential, but it could achieve this at any market value. $500 or $500 000, it doesn’t matter. The value only matters for people’s wallets right now.
I’m personally hoping for this speculating war to be over as soon as possible so Bitcoin’s underlying value can (hopefully) be revealed. Then our focus can shift to a better integration with less volatility (because we need a currency we can trust on a daily basis, and a trustworthy currency is a stable one), and we can work towards the future it always intended. 
In the meanwhile, of course I hope there will be as much winners as possible, but looking at the speculative basis, it seems pretty unavoidable that - whatever the outcome - the majority will end up losing.
