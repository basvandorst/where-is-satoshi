Bitcoin is a huge step forward for the adult industry! I love seeing articles like this that bring awareness of this alternative for receiving payments. Even here on reddit the amount of girls accepting Bitcoin has exploded over the last year, so now almost every girl uses it, and it's the top most preferred payment method across all the selling subs. Very exciting! :)

Just because the coins are now more scarce doesn't mean they're necessarily more valuable. Something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, so that has a bigger effect on how we assign value :)

It's pretty anonymous! There isn't really anything linking the Trezor to an identity unless you specifically name it or something. As long as the security seal is unbroken when it arrives, you should be good to go! :)

The guy just responded to me with this:
"The address you posted your bitcoin address to is a public chan on BM that all BM users can read. If you 'create' a chan using the BM client and enter the chan name as 'general' (without quotes) you will see the address generated is the same one advertised on reddit. I hope you generated a unique bitcoin address before posting here, if that address can be tied to you personally or one of your online accounts the police now know you are involved with a BM chan that regularly receives child porn and can now reveal your identity. Enjoy..."
So much for that! :P

7 years.
Blockchain.info says it has over 5 million user accounts, so if we use that as a conservatively low estimate (there are tons of other wallet services and programs, so the real number could be twice as high, who knows), and if it doubles every 8 months, then in about 10.5 doublings the number of users should reach the number of people on this planet. This works out to about 7 years.
I could be totally wrong though, a ton of people in this sub can do better maths than me, I'm just a pornographer :P
Edit: Updating my estimate to use your 175k as a starting point and I get a little over 10 years :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:47:39
I never really thought about it, but you're right, I don't really have that address shown prominently on the site. I think I'll add it to my about page so I can reference it officially. :)
It is on all of my profiles and at the end of some of my videos though :)
Edit: Oh, and thanks for posting this! :)
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:53:53
It's like this condensed all the thoughts I have while high and made them into a beautiful, inspiring, and frighteningly creepy video.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:58:45
I agree 100%! I can't wait to see them used it more everyday applications! :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:41:11
One of the ways banks transfer money to each other is through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) which batches all of their transactions once each business day. So from Wells Fargo they would batch all of their transactions at the end of the day and send it off to the ACH, the ACH then batches all of the transactions it receives the next day, then BOA batch updates all their accounts the following day. All of this nonsense is why timing is so important when sending fiat, since if you submit a transaction after the batch, you'll at least need to wait until the next day for it to be sent off, or maybe even wait through a weekend/holiday. I can't wait till banks start using bitcoin as their settlement mechanism, it should make fiat transfers almost as instant as bitcoin ones! :)
@_date: 2015-06-21 14:54:40
I like that they put Bitcoin first! :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:57:44
You should be able to just copy and paste it like you would with any bitcoin address! :)

The USB cable issue obviously isn't a big deal and definitely not TREZOR's fault, its just an issue I encountered that could happen to anyone.
One thing that's actually really cool that I didn't know until I actually had the TREZOR, is that you can specify how paranoid (litterally, that's how they describe it in the instructions :P) you are by how many words long you want your recovery key to be! 24 is the max but you could have less if you want :)

Thank you so much! ExtraLunchMoney (for custom commissions) and Clips4Sale (for resales) both take 40% of the value of the sale, and both represent huge portions of my porn-related income streams! ELM is even worse because they pay through Payoneer (a semi-adult tolerant payment processor like PayPal) which takes another couple percent in fees and shitty exchange rates from USD to CAD.
I'm actually signing up for CCBill right now which is the big payment processor for the adult industry so I can process credit cards directly through invoicing or through my website. Still they'll charge about 3%+$0.55 per transaction!
Also, ELM and C4S are both pretty good in terms of profit share; the other big sites take more, some as much as 60%!

I've definitely noticed an increase in the number of my customers who have been paying in bitcoin. At first it was a few per month, then per week, and now it's just about daily! I think bitcoin is about to take the adult industry by storm! :)

So there's tons of cost-related reasons why a merchant would want to accept bitcoin instead of credit cards for adult content: no $1000 setup fee, no 20% fees on transactions, etc., but something I think a lot of people don't immediately think of is how bitcoin can expand your market.
Credit card processors maintain a list (not that I've ever seen it published) of "high-risk" countries that they flat out refuse to process. For example, I've had a clients from places like Brazil, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia request customs but their credit cards won't process. On the one hand, this protects me from chargebacks where chargebacks are common, but what if someone genuinely wants to buy from me? They get discriminated against just because of where they're from, which to me is really, really shitty.
With bitcoin though, the transaction is instant so the customer doesn't have to wait for money to move half way around the world, and for me the transaction is permanent so there's no way a chargeback can be initiated a month after the video is delivered.
So, for a merchant of adult content, bitcoin allows you to receive payments without crazy high fees, arbitrary moral and geographical discrimination, and basically zero risk of chargeback scams.
For the buyer, the reasons are a lot less obvious, especially if they're from a developed country, but that will change as adoption increases. Bitcoin is simply a better version of money, and as more and more people are using it and accepting it, more and more sales will come in through it :)

Haha I was actually originally thinking of doing it topless, but that's against the contest and Youtube's rules :P
For custom videos my rates are between $5 and $10/minute depending on content, personalization, and props! For a simple video like this about 2 minutes long, I could do it for $10 or 0.016 BTC and I can post it to my Pornhub channel :)
If you guys would like that, I'll post an address and if we reach 0.016 BTC I'll do it! :)
Isn't Bitcoin awesome!?
@_date: 2014-10-16 11:40:35
I now have an *effectively* entirely bitcoin income, after having become fed up with our ridiculous banking system. I live in Canada but work online earning in USD, which arrives via cheque. Until just recently, I would take the cheques to a nearby ATM, deposit the cheques, and after a few days they would show up in my USD denominated account, and 30 days after that the hold would be lifted and I could move the funds around as necessary. Not the most efficient system, but it worked reliably well.
Then the bank fucked up, so I decided fuck the banks. After making a deposit a little over a month ago, the funds showed up in my account as usual, but then were suddenly removed. I called the bank to ask "what up" to which they replied they had no idea and that I would have to go into the branch, which is an hour away, and ask in person what's going on. So I do that, and guess what, they have no idea either. They say sorry, wait a month and see if the funds come back. Just a couple grand missing and no explanation why, just another day at the bank I suppose. So I wait, and after a month nothing shows up, so I call up the bank, and after yelling my way up the supervisor chain, we finally get to the answer that you're not supposed to deposit USD cheques in ATM's. Doesn't matter that the cheques I had deposited since the whole fiasco had began had gone through as normal, but these particular cheques had somehow offended my HSBC money overlords. So the cheques were now being sent back to their respective companies, rather than back to me to deposit elsewhere, so now I need to contact about 4 different companies and try to get them to recut my cheques. I'll probably be able to get it all sorted out, but I'm just fed up with this whole situation where I'm supposedly paying my bank to protect my money and make it easily accessible, but then when my money goes missing they don't know or care about it. So, I went into the bank one last time, withdrew a few months cash reserve, and transferred everything else into bitcoin.
Now, I have a bank in the states that allows mobile cheque deposit, so I scan in my cheques, a few days later the funds are fully available, transfer them into bitcoin, and then use bitcoin to pay off my MasterCard through Circle. My rental complex allows payment by MasterCard, so we live entirely on that and then immediately pay it off with the income, and put the rest into cold storage.
It's hugely liberating switching to bitcoin only; I never have to worry about how the bank could screw me over when I most need them. It's crazy even to think that this entire work around wouldn't even be possible a year ago, and I think next year it will be even easier. Maybe it will be because everyone will be using bitcoin by then after being screwed over by the banks one too many times. :)
Sorry for the rant, banks really get me going, and not in a fun way ;)

Interactive porn is definitely the future! The video commissions I do are generally more fetish-y than vanilla, since vanilla porn is all over the internet for free. But if you want to see something unique, like roleplaying your gf's boobs inflating (literally) to huge proportions, there just isn't a lot of great free content out there. Even within fetish genres, not everyone has the same tastes, and I love that I can make someone's particular fantasy into a well done, well lit reality! :)
I do free videos too though, so you should check out my Pornhub channel! 
I'm actually uploading 2 more videos right now! ;)

You're definitely right, this video is more intended for the growing number of p2p transactions in the online amateur adult entertainment market, not really for the bigger studios and sites. Here's the original post I made, giving a bit more context to the video:
I'm actually a CCBill merchant myself, and their service is amazing but the high cost puts it well outside the reach of many independent sellers, who currently rely on Amazon.com giftcards, Giftrocket, Square Cash, or even PayPal in order to get paid. Until now, those have been the easiest ways to do our kind of business online, but now that bitcoin is easily accessible, we don't have to skirt around their rules, regulations, and fees anymore! :)
I actually used Bitpay for my video site, before I had to take it down in order to comply with CCBill's rules. I thought their services was awesome! Super easy to integrate with my shopping cart, I was able to start taking sales immediately, and now the fees are 0% if you don't need support! All of this infrastructure being built out will have huge impacts on these new "taboo" markets and I think this could change the way the porn industry works! :)
I think it's only a matter of time until the big payment processors like CCBill start accepting bitcoin for payment, and cashing out with bitcoin; they could easily double their profits on bitcoin transactions that cut out the credit card companies!
But you are 100% correct in that this video is intended to address someone who would misguidedly use PayPal for adult transactions, instead of Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2014-09-14 23:26:06

I don't know if the government can really pull off their own cryptocurrency. Here in Canada they tried something similar called the Mint Chip, but it never really took off and I suspect it's because nobody cares/trusts the government. If there was ever a USAcoin, who would trade Bitcoin for it? Or even regular USD? They would keep all the inflation they need behind closed doors anyway, and I can't think of any major benefit for the user.
I just don't think it matters, outlawing something never works to stifle it :)

I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but from my understanding, each wallet in Armory has it's own "root key" that every bitcoin public address you generate is derived from, but the "root key" itself isn't an address, just a bunch of 4 letter words.
I've heard that a single private key can be used to generate multiple public keys, but I've never heard of a public key being used to make child public keys. Do you have a use case for that?
But to answer your question about moving funds between "child public keys" within Armory, I do it all the time without an issue :)

As far as I understand it, only contracts get stored on OpenBazaar, so the delivery method is between the merchant and buyer. For me for example, I deliver my videos through a Dropbox link, so once payment is in escrow I would send over the link and the buyer and I will mark the contract as complete and the money gets transferred. :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:13:25

I LOVE BITCOIN. I make porn and Bitcoin is hands down the best way to do business. When people want to commission a video or buy my clips, Bitcoin is fast and doesn't take 40% of my sales! Plus there's all kinds of new ways to interact with my fans, like crowdfunding video ideas!
Back in April I posted a thread where people could vote with bitcoins on what types of things I should do in an upcomming video, and the response was huge! I actually got flooded with custom requests so it's been really delayed but the video will be coming out soon! Part of the promotion was that if the video reached enough bitcoins I would release it for free to the public, and thanks to some generous fans we hit the goal!
I can't wait to see what happens next with Bitcoin. I truly do believe it is the future of everything.
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:48:14

This is exactly what I have to deal with! I have to pay $1000 a year to accept credit cards, then a 20% to 30% in fees on each transaction! And this is better than the 40% every other distributor takes! It's crazy!
Luckily my processor seems to be 100% cool with what I do, but I definitely prefer using bitcoin, and I'd only accept bitcoin if enough people were using it :)
Till then, I'll just try to raise awareness any way I can! :)

Definitely! It's getting harder and harder to do well making generic vanilla content, but the fetish content market is booming right now! I bet one of the big things holding it back is people reluctant to use credit cards tying them to their interest in clown porn, and bitcoin solves that problem!

The voting is now closed! Thank you so much for everyone who joined in! I'm so excited and I hope this is the first of many crowdsourced videos to come! :)
So there was some last minute action and we've now reached 51% of the goal! Here's the breakdown of the votes:














**Total:0.051 BTC**
So I'll be doing a new video where I get fucked hard standing and doggystyle, while wearing a tight corset and doing some JOE/Femdom dirty talking until a big cumshot all over my boobs. And probably some on my face too ;)
After the video is done I'll post some stills and a teaser clip here, with a link to the video on my clipstore! :)
Even though voting is closed, any donations made to the option addresses will still count towards the 0.1 BTC goal to make the video free for everyone! I've got all the addresses I used for this in a special wallet so I can keep an eye on it, so if it ever goes above 0.1 I'll post the download link for free :)
Thanks again everyone! I hope this was fun and we can do it again! :)
@_date: 2014-09-14 22:30:59
Aww, that would be amazing! I'm still in the process of adding in all my videos so there isn't much there now, but eventually I'll have my whole catalog up! :)
@_date: 2014-09-05 03:15:57
Hmmm, I'm not sure, I know not all the features have been fully implemented yet. For me a lot of things don't work, like search and chat, but it's a work in progress! :)
@_date: 2014-10-15 00:24:22
I know Coinbase has had some issues and Circle probably will too at some point, but luckily for all the buyers and sellers on the subreddits I mentioned our transactions are p2p and can't be easily blocked without breaking bitcoin :P
I plan on doing other videos about bitcoin best practices like avoiding address reuse and staying anonymous, but for this I just wanted a very quick, very basic intro just to the concept of being a better version of PayPal.
I personally don't believe in any other altcoins, and I think introducing them could cause a lot of unnecessary confusion, so I generally don't talk about them. :)
@_date: 2014-07-23 01:57:40

I was surprised too, I've been depositing cheques this way for as long as I can remember, CAD and USD alike. It's even weirder that after that one batch of cheques got removed, another I had done a few days later went through without any issues. It's like someone just had a bad day and decided to fuck everything up for me, which is something I just won't tolerate as long as bitcoin is an option :)

You sir, have an awesome job! :)

I'm amazed that these kinds of policies can even exist in the modern world. What judge comes across this and is like "sure, this doesn't seem like a violation of anyone constitutional rights!" I mean, it's even called "Operation Choke Point"! Doesn't that sound like something out of a V for Vendetta type of movie? And if they're trying this now, and no one is fighting it, I can't imagine it will get better, only worse. I'm so glad we have bitcoin now as an option to fight back against these types of injustices. For the first time, I'm actually looking forward to the next "Operation Choke Hold" or whatever euphemistic language they placate the public with, because that will only help push people towards the better alternative: bitcoin.
Anyway, that's my anarchocapitalistic rant for the day! I'm glad I was able to help out with this article, I hope it helps raise awareness in this industry! :)

It's true that 40% isn't so much a fee as a commission, but the are so few options for paying for adult content that many girls, myself included, have to direct our customers to pay through these sites. Can't take PayPal or any other mainstream processor, not everyone uses Interac, and it's difficult to start accepting credit cards because of the huge upfront fees. So the 40% ends up being just a huge tax on sales because we have no other options.
Thankfully now there's Bitcoin! :)
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:17:18
I'm glad you guys like my videos! Bitcoin definitely makes doing what I love easier, and I think it could make a lot of people's lives easier! :)

Just because society tells you that something will make you happy (money, possessions, etc.), or tells you that something you want to do is wrong (making porn, drugs, living simply), doesn't mean it's true. You need to determine for yourself what will make you happy, what you're passionate about doing, and just pursue it.
A year ago we were miserable with our normal lives, "good" jobs, accumulating crap, and generally doing everything we were "supposed" to do. Then when everything fell apart we realized that you can't rely on how things are "supposed" to go, so we took the leap, started doing what we loved (making porn), and threw away most of our possessions (anything that wasn't directly useful or made us happy). We're happier than we've ever been, even though society says everything we do is wrong. :)

Thank you! I think if colored coins can be made easy to use, they could be used in all kinds of non-financial ways that could really raise awareness! :)
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:01:17
Interesting note so far, I've been using only 0.00001 BTC for the fee to send the Saffrons, and they still haven't had any confirmations, so that might be something to consider when setting up the colored coins?
@_date: 2014-10-03 00:00:25
Aww! I've noticed that taking contracts to completion seems to not quite be working, I've gotten a bunch of "sales" but no one has actually paid anything :P
I know it's all just tests for now but it would be cool to see a successful transaction! :)
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:28:43
I use Armory and it's awesome!
I always generate new addresses for each transaction :)
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:53:56
Yes! Why should PayPal and the credit card companies get to dictate what is and isn't acceptable in a free market! :)
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:14:00
So for me there's 2 cases: when I get a custom commission in, there's usually a few days before shooting happens (because my schedule fills up fast), so waiting on "cumfirmations" isn't a problem. As soon as I see the transaction in my wallet, I add the order to my schedule! :)
For sales of things like individual clips directly with bitcoin, I'll usually wait until there's at least 1 confirmation before sending the link if the customer isn't a regular, but it's not a hard and fast ;) rule. I've never had a double spend issue, and to me the likelihood of it happening is pretty low anyway. :)

You most definitely can has color coins! :)
As I understand them (and I don't claim to understand them well) you need a colored coin wallet, like the one CoinPrism just released, which lets you keep track of any colored coins you might have. So I send the coins (about 600 satoshi I think) to you, and then you can send them about as usual. If you were to give me an address from a standard wallet, I think it would show you just received plain old bitcoins, but a colored wallet will show which coins are linked to which assets.
So if you want to give it a try, set up a wallet and put up an address, and I'll send you a Saffron! :)
You can use them to buy my clips at a discount, or just collect them and pass them on to your grandchildren! :P

I love hearing about new fetishes too! :)

Thank you, I really do love bitcoin! :) 
I can appreciate what you mean about associating bitcoin with various "shady" things like weed and porn, but I think for many this is one of the main draws of bitcoin! Not the fact that you can buy weed and porn with it, but that you can buy anything! Free of censorship! Free from gatekeepers! Freedom! :)
I believe that as long as what you want to do doesn't harm anyone else (and I think the illegality of drugs is more harmful than the drugs themselves), then you should be able do/buy/sell whatever you want! :)
I should mention that I have pretty strong libertarian leanings (if you haven't noticed :P) so the show will naturally tend to skew with that bias, but things like weed and porn won't be all I talk about; just whatever I happen to think is sexy in the world of bitcoin at the time of shooting! :)
I know the show won't be for everybody, but I hope I can at least help get more people interested in bitcoin! :)

That's crazy! Shorting is a great way to capitalize on the downward momentum of the price after a market correction, and I suppose as long as they continuously rebuy then they just have a short term negative but long term neutral effect on the price. I wonder if their greed actually hastens the return to normal valuations so we can get back into bull mode faster! Greedy though they might be, they do add valuable liquidity to the market :P
If anyone has done the TA on the cycles, how has the innovation of the ability to short Bitcoin affected the duration of the bear market between price peaks? :)

We've always been very tech oriented and try to stay on top of a lot of tech news, and remember first hearing about it from some tiny blog or article back in the day. Back then the only way to learn about it was going through the forums, which was difficult, then setting up the client was annoying since it had trouble syncing with the network. Overall there just wasn't much use it for us back then, so we just kept an eye on it from the sidelines.
Dennis' company actually got very interested in bitcoin and mining right around the time the price went from $30 to $100, and being the only one who knew and understood how bitcoin worked, he helped them get set up. He got them to order a first gen KnC miner which was really exciting, until it was clear there would be no magical ROI on it after the bubble popped (and difficulty skyrocketed).
He even helped them buy their first bitcoins, from a shady little "exchange" up here in an industrial park, and was so excited to see the little 5 GH/s BFL usb miners they had set up.
Barely a year ago, crazy times! :)
Also, awesome username! :)

I mean interactive porn as in porn where the user directs the content to their own personalized tastes rather than just accepting whatever the mainstream porn industry dumps on the market. Camgirls service a huge part of the market that wants one on one interaction, but they generally don't serve the market that wants high quality, high production value fetish content. The markets aren't mutually exclusive either, and more and more girls are making pre-made or custom content for their fans because it's easy now to set up a store and resell passively. This wasn't possible (or at least as easy as it is now) a few years ago, and I think it's only going to get bigger and easier! :)
If you want to see blowjobs, you'll never run out of videos on PornHub. If you want to see a blowjob where the girl is wearing clown makeup, the number of videos you'll find is way lower. That's where I come in! And I don't think enough people realize this is possible :P
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:49:47

I've had this happen too! During my testing a few times my transactions would get stuck as "sending" long after they'd been confirmed in the blockchain, and trying to resend would give me an error saying my balance was 0 when it definitely wasn't. The best solution I found was just to export the key I needed from DarkWallet and import into Blockchain.info, then send it back to myself for more testing. One of the times, even after doing all of this my DarkWallet balance was still messed up so I just reloaded the whole thing from seed and that seemed to do the trick! I hope that helps! :)

@_date: 2015-01-02 14:04:42
I haven't specifically talked to them about it yet, but I've been working with the guys from BitPay to get set up (they're awesome!) since they were the only bitcoin processor to have a payment gateway for our membership plugin. I asked around to a bunch of membership plugin devs if they had anything planned to accept bitcoin, but it seems a lot of that work kind of gets outsourced to the community for them to develop any additional tools they need. Most of the membership plugins even only accept PayPal! Right now the BitPay gateway is actually broken so temporarily subscriptions are just regular store items and then I have to update the membership manually. BitPay is on it though so hopefully soon the whole process will be automated :)
I think we're still in such an early stage that there just aren't a lot of options for sites like ours yet, but I suspect in the future there will be a ton. I see a future where a lot of bitcoin payment processors are really just plugins that don't require signing up for any one company, and the bigger companies like BitPay and Coinbase will primarily serve larger businesses that have a lot of support requirements.
That's the future I'm excited for, I want to go to there :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:34:34
I think the VIXIA is definitely better at taking video (at least as far our skills go :P) but the quality of your video depends on a lot of other factors too so the T3i could still be a great starter camera for you to get familiar with! :)

I'm a digital content producer, and I don't really worry too much about piracy, I actually love seeing people post my stuff around! :)
I think the best strategy is to just accept that piracy exists, and work with it! I post free videos to Pornhub all the time, and I watermark all my videos in case people share them they'll know where they came from. It's all just more advertising! :)
Bitcoin is amazing for crowdfunding! I've been experimenting with it for my video projects and so far it's been great! If it were possible, I would love to crowdfund all my videos and give them all out for free! Maybe in the future that model will work for me and that's a future I want to live in! :)

Whoops! Thank you, I just fixed it! :)

Yep! Those are hosted through Amazon S3/Cloudflare, nothing is actually on the site itself! Depending on your connection it may take some time to buffer fully, but all the other clips are available for download too if the streaming is too much (all my clips are full 1080p so they're quite large) :)

I use the T3i to take pictures of my puppies all the time! It's awesome! :)
I just use an EF-S 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Type II and EF-S 55-250 mm f/4-5.6 IS Type II and find they're really versatile and perform really well! I much prefer the IS models since I don't have to worry so much about camera shake :)
However, for shooting videos, you might want to go with an STM lens or a better DSLR that can handle autofocus during recording better than the T3i. I only use the T3i for certain static shots where the subject isn't moving much and can stay in focus without having to constantly adjust focus, which sucks without STM lenses since you can hear every movement the lens makes! Better to go with an external mic if you don't have STM lenses :)
Hope that helps! :)

I've actually been approached by quite a few other alt-coin developers (especially adult-themed ones), but I'd only ever be interested in accepting bitcoin-backed sidechain coins or maybe even colored bitcoins. A lot of the developers that I've told this to have said that they're interested in going in that direction though, which is awesome! We really believe bitcoin specifically is the future :)

I really hope that the industry starts to catch on to the freedom that is bitcoin, it could be huge! We've had so many issues with banks and payment processors just because what we do is a little too taboo for some people, so bitcoin really changed everything for us! :)

The problem is that the credit card companies don't allow for a lot of the types of videos I like to make, like intoxication, taboo, bondage, etc. When I first signed up with my credit card processor they went through my whole catalog and flagged half my clips for being inappropriate according to their imaginary guidelines, so I just had to take my store down. Now, I can post up anything I want, anything my fans want, and no one can say anything or stop a payment from going through! :)

I totally agree, and that's one of the things I really hate about porn membership sites these days! When we tried to cancel our PlayboyTV trial membership it was a huge hassle!

Oh definitely, I think holding is currently the best strategy for seeing real returns, but I'm wondering about people who are going after those small short term gains. If the market is rigged, and I fully believe that it is, how much should someone have if they want to really make waves? 1000 coins? 10,000 coins? And I don't mean using leverage, since the whole idea is to reduce the risk of just getting wiped out.

@_date: 2015-05-09 19:10:15

My husband and I are actively trying to move to full on bitcoin, now that there are services that allow us to spend in bitcoin easily. We've been fucked over (I'd wink at the pun if it wasn't such a serious problem) by banks so much lately that we've just had enough!
Between XAPO and Circle, we can effectively pay for everything with bitcoin, and we only need a bank account to deposit cheques which we immediately convert to bitcoin. We only keep a few months worth of expenses in fiat hard cash (don't trust the banks with any more than we need to) just in case of a total collapse, but we believe in the long term success of bitcoin.
The plan is to phase out banks completely as we earn more and more in bitcoin :)
We're hardcore ;) believers!

This has been discussed on Bitcointalk as well, except using Armory. Generate a secure wallet on an offline machine as usual, then put a watching-only copy on your server to give out addresses for payment and check that funds have arrived. If the server is ever compromised, the private keys aren't there so nothing can be stolen. Extending the concept like you're saying is a great way to safely accept bitcoin without actually carrying around large amounts (in the form of valuable private keys on your device). I've never used Mycellium, but I agree that Copay would be an excellent user friendly way to do this. :)
@_date: 2015-08-03 20:51:04
When you go to "Backup This Wallet", one of the options should be "Export Key Lists", which should show you all of your public addresses and their corresponding private keys (in different formats that you can select). You can check the balance of the public addresses on an explorer like Blockchain.info, then on just about any wallet out there (including Blockchain, though be careful using them for large amounts :P), you can import the keys you need and spend from them as usual. :)
I don't know if the "Export Key Lists" option is only available on newer Armory versions, but you can always download and install the latest version and import your wallet without waiting for the whole blockchain to download :)
@_date: 2015-08-06 19:49:57
Worst case scenario they could still bundle all of their trades from a day into a single transaction and still achieve T0 :)

Interesting, I did not know that! :P
Still shouldn't be too much of a problem though; I'm sure if they're processing millions of dollars a day worth of trades, paying even a dollar per transaction (even if multiple times per day), the higher fee would be well worth it :)

I don't think Armory seeds are compatible with any other wallets yet, since as far as I know they don't use BIP32, but there is an Armory daemon you can put on a server so you can basically have the functionality of Armory Offline. To use Mycelium gear though, you'd have to generate your BIP32 pubkey using something other than Armory. That's my understanding at least, I'm no expert :P
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:11:57
Probably not, if Bitcoin remains in use as a day-to-day currency. Merchants are charged based on their risk profile anywhere from 3% to 20% (I'm closer to the 20% end of the scale because I sell porn), so if the fees are that huge on transactions, then only large transactions will be handled by the main blockchain. For example, if on a $100 sale the fee is $10, then Bitcoin probably won't be used for buying $3 cups of coffee. Now, if the fee on a $10,000,000 transfer is $10, then the main blockchain will probably only be used by early adopters (us) and big institutions. Of course, for the fee to reach $10 then the demand for creating main blockchain transactions would have to be pretty high and Bitcoin pretty valuable.
If this is the way things go, then sidechains with lower fees will probably be used for day to day transactions. These will still be backed by Bitcoin though, so no matter what "bitcoin" will always be cheaper to accept than credit cards. No middlemen taking their cut :)
@_date: 2015-07-31 04:34:59
I don't foresee that being a major hindrance. I imagine a future where bitcoin wallets are integrated into most services we already use. I'll have a Microsoft wallet tied to my Hotmail account, a Google wallet (as part of Google Wallet maybe? :P) tied to my Gmail, and so on. They'll all be "online" 24/7 the same way my email is, and the amount I keep in each one will depend on how much I use it. Signing up for a subscription will be as easy as clicking "Make this payment recurring" just like setting up a Google Calendar event. :)
@_date: 2015-07-31 05:05:09
Yes, I want a ~~PayPal~~service where I have the option of offlining and onlining my funds as I see fit. You of all people should understand that that is the future Bitcoin makes possible, Luke.

@_date: 2016-09-09 18:23:28
Oh yeah, I totally get what you mean and that's awesome! I was actually thinking something that the creator would have even more control of. For example, I could host vids on my site that might be $0.50 to watch, or if not you could watch an ad for my site that would talk about the benefits of becoming a member, or maybe an ad from a sex toy company that gives me an affiliate code, that sort of thing. If I know I could get a certain conversion ratio from an ad, and it would be enough to cover the cost of streaming, then that would be really interesting for other creators who want to sell you their merch or subscription box, and have more control over their advertising :)
@_date: 2016-09-09 16:58:07
Cool! Would you guys be open to a third option, for the video player to display an ad of some kind instead of payment? Maybe even an option in the player to serve up a different resolution depending on the payment method/price? That would be cool :)

I never used the fiat conversion feature, the real issue is that I need a payment plugin that accepts bitcoin and also ties in with my website's membership function so that as soon as their payment is accepted they can sign in and start downloading. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:53:01
That works in theory, but when I was receiving bitcoin directly for my website membership I had to then also manually activate their accounts too. This meant a 24 hour waiting period for bitcoin members, which I and many others disliked since credit card memberships were activated instantly, and now I have so many bitcoin members that it would literally be impossible to constantly activate accounts within a reasonable amount of time, unless I hired someone to specifically do so. E-commerce sites need a program like Bitpay to tie into their sites to automate the process or it will severely hinder their ability to accept a large volume of payments. Accepting directly only works for those who have few incoming payments to deal with. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:55:36
It's more like that the member would have to wait for access until their payment is accepted. They wouldn't be able to watch any videos for free as their account would still be awaiting activation. And I know XXX customers don't like having to wait! :P
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:09:59
It's too bad I didn't/don't have the time to program the whole thing myself, my time is better spent making porn! :P

That's not how the membership software works and my website offers downloading so theoretically they could site rip and then spread all of my videos. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:02:07
Riiiiight?! We've been with them since the very beginning and have talked to them personally many times. They even helped me set up my payment gateway in the first place! But I guess a cold form letter is all I get now! :(
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:05:28
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:13:19
The problem we have is that we have membership software that works with my credit card processor, but in order to handle Bitcoin memberships the same way, BitPay was the only plugin available to me at the time. Luckily now I can just drop in BTCPay in its place and be fine, but 3 years ago it was not an option! :P
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:28:20
I love this feature! :)
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:05:08
Bitpay just automated the process for me to receive payments, once the threshold of .01BTC was met they paid out to me so there was never much held by them.

It's probably that as soon as they allow for XXX payments they become a "high risk" payment processor which increases their costs with the fiat world. It's the same reason CCBill can exist but their fees are 10x regular credit card processing fees for merchants. :(

Without taking into account your electric bill, the S1 will earn you about $10/month, so you might ROI in 2 months, if your purpose is to turn energy into Bitcoin. Taking electricity into account at 8 cents/kWh (where I live), it'll cost you about $20/month to run. So, $20 worth of energy into $10 worth of Bitcoin each month at current exchange rates/difficulty.
Of course, you could just run it in heater/lottery mode and some year you might get a very merry Christmas :P

I think arbitration businesses and service aggregators will rise up to fill that role. Instead of PayPay (or maybe PayPal if they realize this), you might want to pick an arbiter business that provides ratings for buyers and sellers and cultivates a reputation system. So when you go to buy from someone, you see their rating at ArbiterExampleCompany.com, you use ArbiterExampleCompany.com's xpub as the third party in your escrow transaction, and then you can rest easy that if there is any sort of fraud, they'll take care of you just like PayPal would (ha! :P). Bitrated is the closest I've found to a real consumer solution to this problem, since they provide an easy way to make escrow transactions and allow you to browse arbiters. In the future, there will probably be tons of competing services like this so you can choose any one you want, unlike now where you're basically stuck with PayPal. Maybe all the services will standardize reputations through a Bitcoin burning scheme, so you're not even locked into an ecosystem as an arbitrator. None of this has been truly possible until now, so these are very interesting times to experience :)
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:48:18
Hey! I love the Coinkite wallet setup! What I'm really after though is more like an HD multisig lockbox where every new address generated is a multisig address that requires multiple keys to unlock. Basically like instead of the typical HD wallet where each new key starts with a "1", each would start with a "3". I know it's probably overkill and maybe not even technically possible, but to me it would be that extra tiny peace of mind that I would love! :)

I think banks will still largely exist as they do now, but with the popularity of proof-of-reserves and reduced need to flow your money through them, they'll need to be very careful with their behavior or risk a bitcoin-bank run. They'll still provide loans and financing services, which may require running under fractional reserves, but it will be easier for a consumer to decide whether or not they want to use them. For example, if BitBank A maintains a 70% reserve ratio and offers 5% on deposits, and this is a service I'm interested in, I might choose them over BitBank B that maintains a 25% reserve ratio but offers 15% on deposits. I'm sure there will be people who find both those offers interesting based on their risk profile :)
In generally though, I think the bitcoin revolution will just force banks to be more responsible. Many will have to shut down for acting so irresponsibly in the past, but many more and new ones will come out that function basically as they do now.
For me, a bank should do 3 things: Keep my money safe, make it easy to use, and pay me if they use my money to make more money (lending). Right now, banks largely do none of these things, unless you're very rich, and even then history doesn't support that. My money is far from safe in the bank (banks have literally lost thousands of my dollars for weeks with no explanation), they don't make it easy to use at all (I have to jump through hoops and pay just to use my money), and they don't pay me anything for the risk they subject my money to (I ran the numbers the other day, and I earn about 1/1000 of a percent on my savings account, and PAY a couple percent in fees just to have an account). Add to that legislation that my country has passed making it legal for the banks to freeze and seize my funds in the event of a collapse, and it just doesn't make sense to keep more than you need to in a bank. I really hope this changes in the future though, and I think bitcoin makes it possible :)

Who do you think is trying to hide or move their money? Wealthy Chinese elites with strong ties to the government. If you're a beaurocrat who earns tons under the table from bribes, you'll probably do everything you can to promote bitcoin acceptance. Or at very least be two faced about it and block the common people (who have little to no money to put into bitcoin anyway) while you stuff your pockets with bitcoin then all of a sudden come out in favor of it. The Chinese government (along with all governments) thrives on corruption, and bitcoin (sadly or not) makes it way easier :)

I suspect the problem lies in the fact that exchanges hold your money for you, in whatever form that is, and if you're going to offer that as a service to the public then there should be assurances in place (in the form of rules like registering as a MSB) in order to help protect the users of the service. Not that it always helps, but it should help provide some legal recourse in case the owner spend all your funds on icy frappachinos ;)

How come they never view dollars or euros as tools for criminals? I bet way more crime/terrorism is financed with fiat than with Bitcoin.
It would actually be awesome if more criminals used Bitcoin, the market cap would have to shoot up to support them! :P

We're still so early in the history of Bitcoin, it's not surprising that the user experience isn't perfect yet. The Internet 20 years ago was so shitty compared to now, imagine what the Internet of money will look like in 20 years. It took so long getting everyone to use email, we've barely gotten anyone to use Bitcoin yet! ;)

@_date: 2015-10-15 23:53:23
I think things are going pretty well in the space, lots of projects are getting closer to release, some big institutional-capable exchanges have launched, awareness and price are increasing in areas with tight capital controls/failing economies (great for insight as to how things might go in our area of the world :P). Price has stabilized recently and more and more people are making the comparison between bitcoin and gold, even fringe blogs occasionally reference it along side gold, much to the dismay of the goldbug commenters! The media narrative is slowly changing from "dark market currency" to "just another way to think about how money works". I don't know how close we are to completely replacing traditional currencies, but I think we're a lot closer than we were even a year ago. Myself and many others are now able to earn and spend completely in bitcoin, and I'm sure more people will be making the switch as they see the benefits. Things are definitely on an upward trajectory right now, so that's nice :)
Oh, and INB4 the obligatory MOON! :P

I would hope a currency that only goes up in value over time promotes more conservative and responsible spending :)

My philosophy is that it doesn't matter what at what price you acquire bitcoins right now. $100, $200, $300... in the end when the world is running on bitcoin the purchasing power of a single coin will be enormous, so I just say enjoy being able to afford a whole coin now! We're so lucky be be perfectly positioned during this 21st century gold rush! :)

How far away do you think we Canadians are from simply having Bitcoin accounts at our banks? Basically, when do you think banks will accept the Coinbase\PayPal\etc model and really try to be internet banks? I would imagine it would cut down on overhead dramatically! :)

I think if people had a steady stream of bits coming from their devices a-la 21 computer, I don't think paying a bit here and there would matter much to people. Especially if they could receive bits for posting good content :)
@_date: 2015-10-16 00:26:00
I agree with "price doesn't matter" to a point. For me, the benefits with bitcoin are the same regardless of price. If a bitcoin was a penny each, I'd just have way more. Obviously though, for bitcoin use to be so widespread that everyone is using it, the market cap and thus the per unit price would have to be much higher just to support their economic activity. The "price doesn't matter" aspect to me is extremely important though, and one of the many reasons I think bitcoin will take over the world :)

Just hasn't been around long enough. Barely anyone uses bitcoin right now, so even if these services were to spring into existence right now, their earnings would be miniscule compared to the established players. They will exist, it will just take time for them to take root :)

BitPay (as awesome as they are) is really only an intermediary business until bitcoin is ubiquitous. In the end there should be no need for any of these payment processors, exchanges; anything that interfaces with fiat will be irrelevant.
Now, if they start offering multisig arbitration services (or lightning network hub services), their relevance might be greatly extended ;)

Yeah, with Coinbase and Quadriga you're basically paying spot price plus maybe a percent or 2 in fees, but with QuickBT you're paying like 7% over spot. Plus you can only buy like 0.2 BTC at a time, or about $90 CAD right now :(

I get that, and it's good that they're taking responsibility, but if no money has been lost and all that's needed to fix the situation is for everyone to update their passwords, then why the need to shut down altogether? I'd say take the credibility hit, fix the database vulnerability, and work on re-establishing the lost credibility. Especially being one of the very few Canadian exchanges, it just doesn't make sense to me. How many times was Gox hit before they shut down? Target lost a ton of people's credit card info in a hack, and they didn't shut down. Seems to me that something else must be going on, and with the withdrawals being blocked I wouldn't be surprised to learn that things are far worse than they're letting on...
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:41:33
Easier to circumvent capital controls with Bitcoin. And makes bribery/off-the-books sales easier. And the government can't arbitrarily devalue/seize/freeze it. And it doesn't show up on X-Ray when traveling.
Imagine what will happen once they realize there's no need/point going back to fiat ;)

You could just set whatever browser/app you use to access the Pornocopia to filter out anything tagged as child porn or underage, that way if it's illegal in your jurisdiction you can avoid it.

I run a reputable adult website that accepts bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2015-10-04 04:58:57
Those companies aren't accepting bitcoin just because BitPay made it easy for them to. They're doing it for the publicity, and for all the reasons that bitcoin is superior to fiat. If BitPay went under, they would switch to the next option, or roll their own solution. One of the greatest advantages bitcoin has is that it doesn't need middlemen to work.
Who even cares whether retailers accept bitcoin anyway? I just pay with credit card and then pay my credit card with bitcoin. This flow will probably exist even when bitcoin is ubiquitous, and my credit card is denominated in bitcoins. Bitcoin makes trade easier, and that's why it will win.

Check out A-Ads for earning through advertising, they're awesome! :)
It is possible to build a miner using a Raspberry Pi and some USB miners, but you probably won't earn much. USB miners are just little mining chips that you can plug into a USB port that the RPi controls ( but they don't usually have a very high hashrate, meaning you'll need a ton of them to make a significant amount of bitcoins.
Unless you're looking to spend millions building a bitcoin mine (think like the capital expenditure it would take to open a gold mine), mining on a personal level is best looked at as a way to buy bitcoins through your electric bill, and generally at a loss compared to just buying through an exchange.
Of course, there's always running the miners in lottery mode for fun, and maybe someday years from now you'll strike it rich! ;)

It's like the government knows something is going to happen, and when it happens they won't want you to be able to buy gold, guns, or Bitcoin. I don't believe they're doing this just because they don't "like" certain industries, they're doing it to preemptively avoid problems in the future. It's terrifying! :(
@_date: 2015-10-03 16:06:11
Try Circle, link your US account (and Canadian one too if you want, they don't seem to discriminate by country as much as Coinbase does), send your coins there, then withdraw to your US bank. I do this all the time just in the reverse direction. Be careful though, with a new account they might set your limit really low and you'll be forced to withdraw slowly. I hope that helps! :)

Technically you can spend Bitcoin anywhere in Canada, just pay for things with your credit card as usual, then use Circle to pay off your bill with Bitcoin. I know it's not the same as spending directly, but at least this way you don't have to wait for merchants to catch up! :)

I suspect that the Chinese realize that even though their government SAYS they're easing for now, it doesn't mean they will forever and at any moment could change their position on it. I think that would make Bitcoin's immunity to capital controls very appealing :)

You don't have to link a bank account if you don't want to, and both of them allow instant purchasing with a credit card without any more verification than PayPal. I use both and I don't even have a SSN! :)
