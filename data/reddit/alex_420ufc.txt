Good point (I forgot about that)! Yes if u have an app wallet ready you can get your funds immediately!! bless up brotha 
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:23:33
great question, I’m also considering that one! 
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:16:35
just depends (everyone situation different).
best advice is to hodL as long as possible until it’s the new wave/totally mainstream 
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:10:53
 for the long term buyers this is a good chance right now,,,and to cost average. 
Soo no excuses for anyone in the future when we bull running again, btc has given everyone plenty and plenty of chances to get at least some by now loll

@_date: 2018-02-19 05:36:15

@_date: 2018-03-24 23:45:02
All good brotha, do what you gotta do! And tbh, you’re already rich (in another way) if you got a wife by your side w/o the lambo scenario!! Salute

anyone know if satoshi ever wrote anything about whales controlling btc?!?!? In his white paper I mean...I wonder what he thinks of it or if he knew this would happen ?!?! 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:16:21
I understand their will be blood but hopefully it can hold at 6500-7500 range max!! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:30:39

idk barely any places use or accept real BTC as it is, so truthfully I don’t think ppl use or trade bitcoin cash at all loll 
the atm’s at the malls are only for btc, not bitcoin cash. The companies (Expedia, overstock, etc) we hear using crypto only take real btc. The ads on pandora or the overseas newspapers are for real BTC...
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:47:30
You can book flights, hotels &amp; car rentals and they accept bitcoin!  Cheers from California

@_date: 2018-02-19 02:06:23
they won’t 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:26:28
people on here always say “whales” buy &amp; sell their own coins to manipulate the prices....not sure how exactly they do it that’s why I asked. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:35:34
the mark up with atm machines is very noticeable loll definite higher prices than coinmarketcap or cBase loll when I go to the malls and I look at crypto atms it’s like a $400+ dollars difference (maybe even more) 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:02:38
brotha, the rich people like the winklevoss buy up hella crypto because they 
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:32:32
Ok yeah smoke another one bro 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:33:38
I’m from California and I heard of bitcoin in like 2011 but I didn’t know where to get it or how it worked at all (so don’t feel regret hindsight is always 20/20).  Now I’m just trying to get what I can (started last year) afford 
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:29:08
Laminated paper wallet &amp; vaccum seal....hide somewhere only you know. Check it every birthday &amp; re-vaccum seal. repeat until gift day. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:14:47
I believe their office is in that downtown area with “brick side walks” loll  near some shops (The Gap) 
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:33:38
Very true. All these shill haters just mad they didn’t stack up
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:58:53
Smoke another one bro...
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:32:47
if you’ve been all about BTC for the “past five years” then you should have your stack big enough that you don’t hate on others (whales or not)...
@_date: 2018-02-17 07:24:31
Winklevoss twins or maybe relative ?!?!? they always got an ace up their sleeve 
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:42:04
the winklevoss twins have said they will never sell,,,,they understand that we are in the early dot com era equivalent with cryptos (when barely anyone had a computer, let alone the internet). So take that and run with it bro,,,get as much as you can &amp; trust the process
