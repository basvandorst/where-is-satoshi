Easily the worst experience I have had dealing with crypto markets and exchanges. I heard uphold was like coinbase but faster so i decided to try it. 
After uploading all my personal information and pics of my state ID, something I did not have to do for coinbase, and getting my account "verified" I was still not able to link my bank account as I would get error messages and was not able to complete it. I then linked my debit card from the same account no problem and made a purchase and sent a message to uphold support about not being able to link my bank account.
I was surprised within about 30 minutes I had a response saying it was because my account was from a credit union so I would have to send a recent statement with my info on it. One hour later I did and now its been about 2 days and no response to my questions about how long it will take or my concern of a lack of a response when I had just handed over my personal data.
What really made me actually waste my time writing this is that Im just now noticing that for $50 of bitcoin I buy on coinbase I was charged $50 out of my bank. For $50 of bitcoin (or usd you have to transfer first smh) I was charged $52, 3.99% card fee that I had no choice about using and did not want to use, and now a .44 cent "debit card fee" has just showed up from them also.
Im not dumb and have this bank account just for dealing with crypto but I have to say I have never encountered a problem or thought I would have to close it and get a different account until dealing with uphold. I never write reviews. this may be the first one ever and that is how mad this "company" has made me hope somebody reads this and learns from it.
Its really messed up to do bad business when your dealing with peoples personal information and bank accounts.
