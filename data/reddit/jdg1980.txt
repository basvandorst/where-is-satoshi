Telling people to do the digital equivalent of shoving their money under the mattress is not a solution. It's an admission of failure.

Simple. Many of the biggest holders are very bad people who might kill them if they don't get their money back. And the small holders are numerous enough that they might be able to issue enough complaints to get the authorities to investigate the scam. That makes the middle-ranking depositors the easiest remaining marks.

That's not how bankruptcy law works (at least not in the US - I suppose it could be different in Japan, but I doubt it). A bankrupt company can't arbitrarily decide to pay some of its creditors and not others. It all has to be approved by the courts.

Since fixed money supply and a deflationary currency are terrible ideas, good riddance.
That said, the problem isn't that Vircurex was running a fractional reserve; the problem is that they were doing so in a dishonest manner. Their customers believed that they were running a straight-up exchange where they could get their coins back any time they wanted regardless of what other customers were doing. Had they known it was fractional reserve, they would have either used a different exchange, or at least demanded a decent risk premium.
