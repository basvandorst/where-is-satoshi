Wow bitcoin is up 80 million percent in 10 years
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:15:05
It is being adopted and thriving in countries like Argentina, Venezuela, Italy and parts of south east Asia. These countries are going through hyper inflation and the more countries that do, will only increase adoption.

Bitcoin needs to become a stable store of value before it becomes a payment system. How can you not understand that ? By that time lightning network and other second and third layer solutions will be used for payments. No other altcoin has even come close to becoming a store of value.

Are you serious ? Look at his reviews

Who is calling Bitcoin stable ? Once it grows big enough and becomes more stable, it will be viable currency.

It’s like saying if I break down a kilogram of Gold into 1000 grams of Gold pieces, does that make Gold not scarce ? Of course not! Being highly divisible, does not make bitcoin less scarce.

No, it has done the exact same thing on multiple occasions before. Smart and educated people new, it was going to rebound

Wouldn’t be surprised if you are Kirby. The fact you defend a man or yourself, when he charges huge amounts of money to be in a vip group, that he constantly states, that he makes life changing money. In actual fact he doesn’t. If you can’t see he’s a fraud then, you are naive, or you are Kirby haha

Just YouTube Andreas antonopoulos. Best I’ve seen explaining bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-08 22:21:29
Just like when Bitcoin was first invented. Look at it now

If you are going to say there are better choices solely because they can transfer faster, is not the best argument. I’m not a bitcoin maximalist,
But bitcoin is the best of the lot. Highest hash rate, most secure network in the world, simple supply and no one is at the head of bitcoin which can not be said for every other altcoin.

Yeah they will continue from what they have always done. Does it matter in the end when bitcoin continues to make higher yearly lows every year and has been the best performing asset of the last 10 years. When the market becomes much bigger and stable, they will find it very hard to manipulate the price.

Instead of talKing yourself up, you are yet to give an explanation why bitcoin will fail ? Saying people buy it to get rich can be said for any I investment in the world.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:56:10
Maybe give us a reason why it can’t, instead of insulting everyone ? But I’m sure you don’t really understand bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:29:20
How is it not the one and only at this very moment ? Yet again, you ignorance is showing. Please look into countries where bitcoin is thriving Venezuela, Italy and Greece for example which are going through hyper inflation and governments beginning to take money from people’s bank accounts. Stop thinking it has no use for you, because it certainly is for less fortunate people living in countries going through financial problems, that have been created from their own government. Don’t comment if you don’t fully understand or are uneducated on this topic

Stratum V2 will improve decentralisation and efficiency.

Voyager are a broker. They find you the best deal from every exchange.

You do realise that no one will want to sell anything for tether if this happens
