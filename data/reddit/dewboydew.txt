That's interesting, I just looked it up (I'm from Aus so I'm limited with exchanges). So essentially depending on demand, fees can be anywhere between 0% and 0.25%?

Difficult part is not too many retailers will support it as it fluctuates in value. Hopefully some see the opportunity but I'm a tad skeptical. Wherever the option to pay in btc is, it should be cheaper than cash value (as it's essentially tax free), it would be used way more once that happens.

Better to do it all at once to reduce transaction fees though (depending on the exchange you plan to use).
Edit: added brackets information because I didn't realise there were ways to reduce fees through timing.

I notice a vast majority of complaints about exchanges are usually towards Coinbase freezing people’s accounts without contact/support responses. 
People with several coins and people with several thousands have lost their access with no obvious reason.
So I would/do avoid Coinbase for now. 
Personally I use btcmarkets.net however I’m an Aussie so my options are limited in terms of withdrawing due to banks recently being under scrutiny for allowing laundering. 
I’ve successfully withdrawn close to 10k from both btcmarkets.net and coinspot.com
Coinbase doesn’t allow me to withdraw in Australia so that isn’t an option for me and even if it was I wouldn’t risk it.
