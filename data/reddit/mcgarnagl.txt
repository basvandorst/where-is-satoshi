If BTC get's "f*cked real good by wall st" then altcoins will crater even worse as people look to jump ship and cash out to fiat, not buy even more volatile alts.
  Alts do well when BTC stagnates, not when it has wild swings.

Yeah, Netflix is still the only 4k content I've viewed on that thing in over 2 years of having it.  Would be nice if DirecTV NOW or any other streaming cable services started supporting it.  If no other reason so I could watch sweet, sweet sports in 4K... one day.

Really good point!  I was recently thinking about how BTC and crypto holdings are not accepted as assets by most traditional lenders. This should open the door for that legitimacy, as it will be listed with your other investments and assigned a dollar value.  Sweet!

I've had my 4K TV for 2 years and I'm STILL waiting for channels for the damn thing...

Wait, it's not Brent Lambo?  If it's not, it should be!  We should all strive to be as cool and BTC savvy as lil' Brent Lambo.

Unfortunately I read your last phrase in the voice of Harley Quinn... “we’re bad guys, it’s what we do!”

Good post!  I had been wondering why GBTC had taken such a big hit this morning (down 20 percent at one point) without any significant news to rationalize the dip.  This could very well be investors/insiders reading into long awaited competition soon eating into the exorbitant gap in GBTC price to BTC price.  
  
The only other news was that Marketwatch article about Andrew Left calling out GBTC's price gap to BTC and how it will lead to a huge drop off once competition arrives; but this is well known by anyone who follows GBTC and really shouldn't be breaking news worth of a 20 percent dip.  This SEC appointment news may be the real reason for the dip.  Thanks for sharing!

Ah, fuck it.  Yes.  That's your answer, that's your answer to everything!  Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your revolution is over Mr RatioEssendi!  Condolences... the bums lost!  The bums lose at everything!!

Get a Keepkey.  You can buy them on Amazon now and are equally as good as a Nano Ledger or Trezor.
