So all p2p payments on a p2p payment system are spam now, I see.

Who do you think issues debit cards?

Luke, why are you running at a loss?  You are providing critical infrastructure.  Charge a fee, you deserve to be paid for your work.

Good stuff here.  Try it out!

Hey what ever happened with this?  I tried putting much less hashrate on p2pool (&lt;100TH at the time), and had massive performance issues.  Although I guess that could be mitigated by using extremely high share difficulty, if you are in control of the miners.

The fact that he hasn't corrected it, though, suggests that he hasn't bothered to read the replies.

The point is that there are many other things that are probably not equal and have a higher impact.

Plenty of people mine at BTCGuild at a 2% fee.  I doubt more than 20% of your users are such moochers that they'd leave if you added a 1% fee or so.

Well that's quite a bit of deflation right there then.

It was a joke bro
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:26:06
The problem is there's no such thing as "malleability-related theft" and it would be impossible for it to happen at this scale.
Malleability doesn't allow for theft.  It only allows an attacker to change a txid.  Every instance of theft would have to have been accompanied by someone opening a support ticket, and a support rep checking the blockchain for the txid, and then resending the coins.  You're telling me that 750 thousand bitcoins were stolen this way and nobody ever got wise to the scam?  Sorry but that's unfathomable to me.
If there's something I'm misunderstanding about tx malleability, someone please educate me.

I just did test withdrawals of BTC, NVC, LTC and Doge from cryptsy and had no issues.  Everything came through within 10 minutes.

Again, joke.  But I would be willing to bet it's a small minority of users doing that.

Better to make a patch for BIND or djbdns that talks directly to namecoind.
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:40:36
The point is that people mine at cex.io onstensibly to eliminate payout variance (or so they claim), causing a potential 51% attack, and yet they neglect to consider the effect of other potential losses of profit, most of which are more highly impacting once a pool reaches a certain speed.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:41:15
You can be sure that companies mining millions of dollars of Bitcoin every day have discussed every possible setting, and if they have left something at the default then it was on purpose.

Especially if you're claiming to be a "peer to peer" currency that's good for "micro transactions", with "low fees".

You can easily participate in the Bitcoin network with an outbound-only node.  This is not a concern.
@_date: 2015-09-03 22:17:19
I hope you're not the kind of host who blames your customer for being DDOS'd.  That said, have him firewall off the incoming port and he should be fine.  If necessary, he can bump the number of outbound connections in src/net.cpp and recompile if he wants more.

Been running for a few weeks in 'beta' with Terracoin and Bytecoin.  Now that I have the kinks worked out of the system I've added BTC and LTC to the pool.
I know that mtred just shut down a few days ago and I was one of their happy users.. Hoping I can start carrying the torch for providing a quality fee-free pool to Redditors.
