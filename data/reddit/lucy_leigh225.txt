They don’t allow withdrawal from Coinbase

You set aside the BTC for them because they helped you when you were struggling. You even said some of the money you put into buying BTC came from them. So yeah, you’re dad might be too stuck in his ways to see that BTC is viable, but that shouldn’t influence your original motive. You’re struggling now so I wouldn’t say give them the full 10 BTC value, but even half that would be great and it would serve as a greater “I told you so.” I think. You’ll be able to buy a decent new car for your wife, pay off their mortgage, and maybe they can afford to go on a nice vacation, if Mormons do that.

My credit union doesn’t do crypto, at least for Coinbase.

Chances a doomsday prepper is also a Bitcoin hodler? Would be an awesome bunker.

This is awesome!!! Thanks so much for doing this!! 
I’d like to suggest this organization.   It researches Lewy Body Dementia. It’s the second most common progressive dementia after Alzheimer’s, but it doesn’t get the same amount of recommendation. 
My Latin teacher from high school suffered from this form of dementia for the last few years. He was diagnosed shortly after his wife died. He passed away himself November 29th of this year (so a few days ago). The family is asking for donations in lieu of flowers, because that’s what he would have wanted. And he would have. He was the nicest guy and the best teacher. He was always there to support his students. 
You guys may have been familiar with him, actually. Do you remember The Eagle fromJohn Green’s Looking for Alaska? He was based on this man. 
Unfortunately, the organization doesn’t currently accept Bitcoin, but I still think it’s a worthy cause. My great-grandma has Alzheimer’s and watching her suffer made me never want to watch anyone go through that, and this form of dementia is also very bad.

Man I hope this is a troll

Isn’t that still $150,000? Which is a fine return on $3750 but not enough to pay for 4 years of college for 3 kids, at least where I’m from (US).

Ah, so you’re still playing the long-game. My total in-state undergrad tuition (not counting books, living expenses, etc) came to about $50k, give or take. So you’re like right on the money there, but it costs about $32k per year with all the extra stuff. Awesome outcome! Wishing you the best of luck! I’m sure your daughters will appreciate it. :)

This was happening to me too. My bank didn’t support the transaction.

Not one you’d know
