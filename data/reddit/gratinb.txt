I find your whole post inaccurate and riddled with flaws. Prove me wrong.

I feel like while that technically invalidates the point he made, it doesn't invalidate the point he made.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:34:03
I think if we be less condescending, and more willingful to explain why you think they're wrong, this community would greatly improve.
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:44:01
Theres absolutely no way to reseal it?

Cleaning spam from the general public is all fine, but it would be nice if it was done in a transparent way, so we could see the direct reason posts are removed and make sure that posts were removed because they broke a rule, not because a mod disagreed.
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:50:58
do you know why? I don't think I broke any of the sidebar rules, I would like to know for future reference

That makes sense. I didn't come across that post, but its something I've seen a lot on reddit, not just in bitcoin. Where some one comes out and says "this is it i'm joining your side from a neutral stance", then proceeds to list almost all the talking points of that side, pandering to the audience. Bitcoin is a really weird environment where its mostly decentralized and a lot of money is at stake, so the pressures are really high, so all the tactics to win over the population are used instead of actual informed debates to come to a solution, kind of like during elections. I don't know its a really hard problem to combat.

Well said. IMO critical bugs like this need to be announced publically so people know to update immediately.
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:03:40
True, but I'd make sure to engage in discussion so you can share your point of view. No matter the outcome, you learn and so does the other person. Even if you don't convince them you still gain experience in combatting common arguments, or you might find a hole in your logic that you can patch to strengthen your argument.
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:26:41
Out of curiosity why are you pointing out a single person's post without any upvotes? Theres bad posts on every sub.
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:50:15
The fix was submitted before peter todd even tweeted about it O.o It is important that the bug gets publicity so people know to update though. Also your post doesn't really add anything to whats been said before. Theres no "real story" that anybody's missing.
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:54:31
Yeah I could see that being beneficial, but what can you do. Its open source, so people will exploit things for political advantage.

I think he meant he can read it he just can't understand it.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:00:31
or you could call it bitcash is catchier that bcash imo

Huh, I didn't think nebraska would ever need any currency other than corn. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 03:34:59
Wow dude, you gonna hand send each one or do you have a script to scrape comments from this thread with btc address and send? How do you get around people posting multiple addresses on multiple accounts? Anyways here's my address just to see if you can pull through 1LiE7RhTKSpych2vMMrqDpQALgzdpv1yY4

It's pretty well tested. If some one can break this cryptography, I think we would have a much bigger problem on our hands than bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-17 06:36:25
the solution to every problem isn't to make it illegal. if you don't like their website don't use it lol
@_date: 2017-01-08 15:36:24
Yeah well stars are a just a tiny bit harder to create than the solution to a hash.
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:33:21
I think you meant ear, excuse me if it was just a typo.
@_date: 2019-04-26 07:37:51
wait then why would you need a coin to do that?
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:10:13
solidity isn't based on javascript, its in some ways syntactically similar, but is in no way based on it.

What helping to store and distribute the blockchain to new nodes doesn't help at all?
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:40:43
No, I agree with your points there - I went on a side tangent about how this sentiment is not at all reflected in the real world especially in government. And then I began wondering what is the actual solution to a government structure that falls in line with the concept of specialization, because we can't just elect people and expect them to be experts in problems across all domains, and always make the right decisions whether it comes to farm legislation or international politics. I did not mean to straw man you.

You cut off the sentence right after where I said "And then make education for any field free to the public?" xd
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:19:59
Good thing we don't have a system where common ordinary people are elected as representatives to make huge decisions that impact hundreds of millions of people on an extremely diverse set of issues where they might not even be very well educated on even one of them. That would be preposterous.
So whats the solution here? Create a voting system where people who are properly educated in a certain domain get to vote on which solutions to problems in that domain should be implemented? And then make education for any field free to the public? That doesn't sound too bad actually as long as the pools of people actively working and voting on issues are large enough to increase the cost of corruption.

You might have to contact bitpay customer support for a refund. Things like that are usually pretty easy to track and refund.

I don't think you know how facts work everything you've stated is an opinion unless you can show a solid proof. What your'e doing however, is bad for bitcoin. If everyone had discussion like you no one would get anywhere, unless that of course is your goal. I could literally copy paste your argument and replace all the pro bitcoin core stuff and replace it with pro big blocker stuff and we'd have an equally valid argument (which is not valid).
Disclaimer: I own no btc.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:28:14
Thats not true at all. BCC can still use all of the core dev teams work if they wish. Its open source. Also buying crypto doesn't directly support the developers. If you want to support developers its better to donate directly.
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:35:36
I do have my own opinion. I just want people on both sides to stop spouting "the othe side is a cesspool of disinformation and propaganda" without anything to support their opinion. That way discussion doesn't devolve into the shitshow its been for months. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:49:56
I could say the exact same thing about core (many do), so your statements are worthless to me as an onlooker. Provide some links or facts to back up your claims.
