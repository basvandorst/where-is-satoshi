What type of information can coinbase collect and who do you fear it will fall to? I'm new to most of this. I'm a bit out of depth when it comes to the "meta" of bitcoins, as opposed to just their basic functionality. :/

My novice opinion is that Bitcoin just isn't public accessible. I could never sell my parents on this--I can hardly sell those Ludites on cellphones. That said, if there was an iPhone app for bitcoin that didn't evolve sketchy super sp00ky computer code (why we don't teach kids, I really don't know. . .) it could catch on. The problem is, that would involve a more centralized approach at inception. 
:/ 
I can see bitcoin going up only when the news media rockets it back up. The time it went over $1,000 is when I first REALLY started looking at it. Now, I'm watching it fall back down. Do you think there will be a second explosion up? Or do you think people will see the first failure and that will be the end of bitcoin. "Well 1,000 was a fun idea. Some made it 'rich' but not really. Oh well. Maybe next time. You can all go home."
Which is more likely? That's the question, [among many](

I don't know about y'all but I'm cashing in. I thought I was broke but nope! Don't even care if it goes up to $1000 I doubled up :3

Where do you trade and how? I'm looking to convert my money into US dollars for a bit of a loss whatever and then zip it over to bitcoin and then hopefully via the internet get to convert back to digital USD so I can sustain my life style of being poor in 3rd world countries. I'm drunk so I figured I'd scroll down and ask someone instead of making a new thread and wasting everyone's time on the main page. :3
