Good lord I'm convinced there is a prevalence of autism on this subreddit. He specifically wrote blockchain, not Bitcoin.

Finally some dank content

Circle still uses bitcoin in partnerships with other major players in the bitcoin space to enable international money transfers. In other words, they're not the assholes that this subreddit makes them out to be. Love when this community hates on Coinbase, Gemini, and others that are bringing actual value to the ecosystem. Disgusting.
@_date: 2017-02-10 08:52:32
no you're good
@_date: 2017-02-10 08:38:38
Korbit and Circle have a new partnership: 
i believe circle also announced a partnership with a well known bitcoin company in the Philippines, and I'm sure there are others too. they are supporting the ecosystem with a legitimate use of bitcoin.

Their CTO literally detailed how they were not using blockchains in a Medium post a yr ago, this is nothing new. People in this thread sound like children.
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:58:30
Nice job Gemini. Despite scathing comments about them this past year from redditors, it seems that they have kept their heads down and focused on building out their technology and service.
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:27:33
Yes, the stock jumped bc he wore this hat.

Software existed before 1996

You are so angry. This clearly really hurt your feelings. I'm surprised that anyone can be so emotional about a data structure. I hope your owie gets better soon.
@_date: 2017-02-10 08:42:04
Explain. i think it's bullshit that people in this community who contribute nothing to the bitcoin project think it's acceptable to shit on the companies taking the risks to build out the actual applications
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:24:38
Can we please get this clown off of the front page? It seems that he will pander to any side that gains him the most favor in the community.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:42:48
So sad that this is getting upvotes
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:23:20
Agreed, this is unbelievably cringey.
@_date: 2017-01-24 04:10:18
You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:20:09
Why would a business want to set up their own server to support a payment method that is responsible for &lt; 0.1% of their daily transactions? Come on now, let's think about this one practically.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:00:30
This is so fucking stupid. Can't believe the sense of self-importance that would lead you to believe that FB gives a fuck about someone commenting about Bitcoin on their platform...
@_date: 2017-01-24 22:18:56
You give the permissions to that extension when you installed it on your computer, Coinbase can't help with that.
@_date: 2017-01-29 00:34:11
Is it worth it? Depends on how you value your time. Is a week of effort worth less than a dollar to you? If not, then it is not worth your time.
@_date: 2017-01-23 23:54:28
This is the type of service that builds actual value for the bitcoin network. So cool. What is the relative volume of transactions in Thailand and Vietnam with respect to PH, if you are able to disclose that?
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:34:18
God you are such an idiot
@_date: 2017-01-26 07:01:16
They were using too much electricity. This has nothing to do with the fact they were mining. They could have been running too many space heaters in their basement and same result would come out of it.
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:36:49
wrong. He's talking about OTC, not exchange volume. genesis, kraken, and others dwarf coinbase in OTC
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:41:25
I can assure you this is not legal to do in the US, regardless of your intent to "make some extra pocket money".
@_date: 2017-01-24 22:21:11
Looks organic
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:47:01
so circle is still using bitcoin to do international money transfers. This could be yuge if they get the user experience right
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:04:52
They're all legitimate companies, but none of them offer a service distinct from Coinbase's. They all require KYC in order to remain compliant, and it seems like OP is under some sort of compliance review. Point being, if you are leaving Coinbase due to one of BTC_forever's inane rants or OP's anecdote, it doesn't make sense to move your money to another custodial wallet/exchange. 
FWIW, I think Coinbase is fine to use unless you're doing sketchy shit.
@_date: 2017-01-23 23:47:07
Well that just sounds sketchy as hell, not surprised that they took the action that they did.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:07:44
It's between Circle and korbit
@_date: 2017-01-24 22:08:25
You have little understanding of how this works huh
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:06:11
This isn't because PayPal feels threatened by bitcoin. It's because they know that you are a higher chargeback risk (purchasing an irreversible currency with a reversible payment method).
But tin foil hats are sick!!
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:48:09
You are all absolutely pathetic.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:30:08
+1 to this. People here are absolutely fucking nuts.
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:04:08
RSK is not a solution here
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:58:04
Cool argument bro! I'm a shill, obviously.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:47:50
Incorrect, why would they turn to using Bitcoin amidst a wealth of other, better options?
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:28:11
Agreed, proof needed. I think we should listen to what BitPay has to say, their beliefs are very likely in line with the needs of the economic majority...
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:05:35
If you are operating in the US/UK and you were selling BTC through Local Bitcoin without a Money Transmitter License or equivalent, you've fucked up. That's seen as money laundering, is illegal, and if you were doing it in large enough quantities, they've probably filed a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) and sent it to FinCEN or NCA. Good luck.
Edit: Just saw the image. Yep, this is coming from their compliance department. This confirms this isn't an issue with fraud, it's anti-money laundering.
