well if people didnt insist on calling a male a female we wouldnt have to.

not really no.  youre talking about the people who came up with treatments like lobotomies?  yea i dont really consider them to be the most advanced field of study sorry. 
I guess this 'girl' just happens to love videos games like all other guys.  Hey where are all of the other girl pro starcraft players?  ................oh..............seems like he has a boy brain after all.  Maybe all his boy like bad manners are also not really because he is a boy.  You keep playing make believe pretend fairy tale land.  Ill be over here in the real world giving credit to any ACTUAL girl that does well in starcraft.

if you want to call a circle a square its not my problem.  Dont force your stupidity and insanity on everyone else. 
Hopefully you will never have to deal with an actual girl being good at starcraft lest you be faced with the contradiction of saying that a girl has already preformed on the pro level.  Thanks for being a piece of shit that would deprive that legitimate glory from some deserving female.

accepting a contradiction is ignorance.  Sorry that you think wikipedia is the be all and end all of the discussion.

no amount wikipedia sources are going to change his chromosomes to xx.  ever. you can link till you are blue in the face.  nothing about scarlett is female besides his desire to be one.

yes neurological.  he feels like a girl, but he is not.  I dont care if he feels like a girl.  Go for it..long hair, wear dresses, whatever you wanna do.... but you are not a female.

welcome to reality where someone is biologically a male.  nobody gives a shit if he feels like a girl.  That doesnt make him a girl.  funny how boylike his behavior patterns and interests are. Its almost like you are full of shit. This must be so exciting for you to learn about how things actually are in the real world. .

they are not into facts.  only fantasy. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:05:05
he is not a girl. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:03:36
no i dont think its common decency to ignore reality just because someone who behaves like/biologically is a boy in every way does not want to be called a boy. Its called 'reality', check it out sometime instead of being a Politically correct milk toast.

in the real world for people who are not deluded it is a guy.
