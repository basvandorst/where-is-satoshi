Yes, they would be the majority holder, but at what cost?  The first couple million would go for $420 or whatever the current price is, but they more they dump into them, the higher the price would go.  If you were willing to dump $1B into BTC today, who knows how high the price would go.  We could be talking, triple, quadruple and probably a new all time high just from the initial investment.

This is just FUD.  You have no way of knowing if it will crash more than 80%.

And I never claimed it wasn't speculative or volatile at all.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:04:44
Obviously there is a lot of risk, especially if you are investing right now and people should know that, especially ones who are just throwing money at to make more.  I just hate the speculation from so many people.  I was trying to get my parents to invest some money when it was $1000 around the Super Bowl last year and my dad heard from his investment guy that it was a bubble and it would drop below $500 "very soon."  When it hit $2K in May, I said....should have put something in it and he assured me his guy said this was the top of the bubble.  I just don't see how anyone can honesty say price is probably going to drop 80% and not recover for 1.5 years.  Could it happen? Absolutely.  But it's not a certainty at all.

I run a bar and we do between 1-2K in credit card transactions a day and I can't ever recall any of my staff ever laughing at anyone using a card.

Odd, when I get an e-mail from them they refer to me as my first name I signed up with account with.

My large receipt from newegg.com, my very much increased power bill and the amount of time I spend trading my coins tells me that the coins I mine are very much not free.  
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:46:08
Mining bitcoin at this point probably would not be profitable with those cards, but mining altcoins definitely would.  Even at the inflated prices at some of the cards these days ROI probably would be around....2 months or so.  Mine altcoins, sell for bitcoins on one of the exchanges and you are in business.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:28:24
I'll just ask.....what's your reasoning behind that?
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:58:13
Taxes and a mortgage with decent interest rate are two completely different things.  
I would be in the same boat.  Continue with the ~17 years left on my mortgage, or pay the majority of it off but deplete my BTC stash....

No they called him crypsty, which I'm guessing was is his "clever" user name.  The site is Cryptsy.
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:48:35
They have been making a killing off of video cards for months without advertising BTC.  Most of the more common cards are/were going for 30-50% mark up and were continually and continue to be sold out.

The problem is fees charged by credit cards for the vendors.  I'm paying 2-3% on credit cards transactions for my bar.  When you are doing 1500 a day that comes to $30 at 2%.  If letting my customers pay with BTC could save me $30 a day or 10K a year in transaction fees would it be worth it?  You bet your ass it would.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:05:39
Read it close, they called him cypsty, which I'm assuming is his user name.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:04:43
Their fees are outrageous.  I do not use them and I'm not defending them.  I just don't know why people are so surprised they are down right now.

What do people expect?  Those servers aren't meant for thousands upon thousands of people to all get on at the same time and panic sell.

I'll do the math.
BTC = $1125.

I'm an idiot....for some reason I wasn't thinking Coinbase was an exchange.  I always run coinbase through Poloniex and then to the sportsbook I use.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:42:48
That is completely false.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:57:16
I don't understand why you didn't sell off 75% and kept the remaining 25%, or ~5 BTC.  As a home owner with still over $150K left on my mortgage I can see the appeal of being debt free, but you obviously believed in the value and technology this long.....I just can't fathom how you would get out 100%.
Either way, congrats and enjoy debt free living!

@_date: 2017-07-02 16:33:38
Of course I won't, I have nowhere near that kind of money and if I did I surely am not going to wager it.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:10:45
I appreciate the response!  Honestly I think if you truly would want to bet you wouldn't throw outrageous amounts out there and you would probably find some people to actually take on a bet.  There aren't that many swashbucklers out there who are sitting on a fortune that will throw it away on a whim and I think you know that.  If you were saying....bet 10 BTC, which is still a modest amount for most people you would probably get more bites.
I know it's your intention to prove what you have, you have spent countless hours on countless posts beating around that.  I am still unsure what you are doing.  You want to brag about everything....but unwilling to prove anything, I really don't see the endgame.....and that's what got me interested in the 1st place.
I have seen too many people post bogus stories for the attention and then fail to prove anything.  I am curious to see the pictures, I want to know if it's actually feesible.  I want to know what 25 of those mining rigs look like hooked up in these greenhouses with these fabled AC units.  My parents have a place in AZ and have dealt with solar panels and I have a semi-understanding how it all works.  I also have experience with miners and video cards and know how much wear and tear and experience they take by mining so hot for months at a time.
I have read a lot of your posts, not all, and like I said you know your stuff. I want to believe you are running it all because it sounds pretty sweet.  What I don't understand is your need to be condescending and generally just an ass to everyone who is curious.  Hell, you even went on the boat/yacht subreddit, asked advice and basically told them they were all idiots.  
As for me....I run a couple units and with power and after setup I make about $25 a day.  I should have my setup paid off by the middle of next month and will start seeing profit if things keep up they have been since February.  The problem for people like me without a huge bankroll, is making profits is a slow process.  The cost of good cards and RAM have gone up a ton and the fact it's the middle of summer makes it hard to not lose all your profit to keep things cool.
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:16:59
Just like the kid in elementary school who wants to bet $1000 that his dad is friends with Bo Jackson.  You know there's a 99% chance he's full of shit and he knows you don't have the money for the bet.  Thus, nothing ever gets done, resolved, or proven.
@_date: 2017-07-02 05:38:23
I went thru the posts last night and while it seems he is very knowledgeable, he can't back up a single thing.  Can't name who he buys from nor show any real pictures of any current setup.  Anyone claiming to have that kind of setup and making that kind of money and will only prove anything by making outrageously large bets just screams incredibly shady to me.
It's like the catfish that seems so real, has the details, has older pictures, but refuses to meetup or show a live picture. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:09:46
The problem is that you NEVER post answers.  You beat around the bush and call people out for doubting you.  95% of people who doubt simply tell you to post in pictures, name a supplier or show any sort of proof you bought anything.....and you get up on your high horse how you should get paid for showing proof.  Why would anyone in their right mind pay you to prove your credibility?  Like I have said before, you seem to know your shit, you are a smart guy.  Do these 3 things and and your credibility will go through the roof.
1) Post some pictures/video going through your setup.  Easy to do and with such a complicated and might I say cool sounding setup, this is something you should WANT to show off!
2) Link or at least post which equipment you are using.  Instead of saying $650 AC unit from China, let's see a link, let's see some specs!  If you are getting these great units, people want to see!
3) If you are making all this BTC, prove something in the blockchain.  All it takes is a small message on the next transaction.  You have claimed several times that this sub is against this kind of mining and wants to bury posts like yours when in all reality this sub would embrace the hell out of it if you had any concrete proof that it actually can be profitable like you claim.
And....no I am not going to bet you anything, so don't even bring it up.  
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:47:02
If we are being honest, asking for bets of huge amounts only makes you seem less credible, especially if you don't have a wallet id with that much in it to back it up.

The anti-American propaganda on Reddit is a big circle jerk.  Are there a lot of ignorant Americans, especially in the media? Yes.  Do they represent a large population of the nation? No.

It's funny you didn't learn the first time.  8/10 times panic selling is the way to lose money.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:10:18
That's why good investors buy during panic sells instead of sell.

I'm going to assume he knows the volatility of BTC and his banking on his pay being worth a lot more a year from now rather than worrying about what it will be this week. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:02:21
So you are assuming he got paid this morning.  What if he gets paid tomorrow morning and it makes a comeback back to 1000?  He just made 15% on his check.  
I'm also going to assume that he has enough day to day FIAT to help buy things like groceries since his main income is coming in through BTC.  You do know there are people that don't live paycheck to paycheck right?
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:22:08
With the price of bitcoins being so high, using a coin that is a lot smaller amount would work great.  Feathercoin or even as long as megacoin level.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:21:33
If you believe in something in the long run, which many do, panic selling 20% down on the high from the same day is just going to kill you.  BUYING at that level is the way to go, as hard as it is to buy something down 20% of it's value for the day, that's where the real money is.  
I've panic sold enough times with stocks to realize you gotta have patience to invest, unless you are investing in something for a quick term profit.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:37:57
I buy all my friends products off of newegg for him and he sends me bitcoins because he is so flush in bitcoin and so cash poor.

Yes, it's imagining something that already happened! In the past 6 weeks you could pick 2 or maybe 3 times periods, very short ones at that, where it has gone down to make it look like a "bad decision."
Any other time he would have made MORE money from working than he would have otherwise!
When I have ever said in this thread that it's going to the moon?  If you have the disposable income to get by, I think it's a great hold investment though.

Lol we can just stop now. The only people who lost money are the people who panic sold while they were down.
 
Yes, the guy is a giant idiot for getting his paycheck in bitcoin because at one point today it was down 20% and he can't buy groceries.  /s
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:52:02
So you want to believe this guy lives paycheck to paycheck, gets paid in BTC, immediately trades them in for cash and then pays bills, rent, groceries etc?  
You are assuming just as much as I am in this instance.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:21:40
So don't do it with YOUR paycheck.  Imagine if he would have gotten paid in Bitcoins 6 weeks ago, and now his paychecks from them are all worth 5x now.  Hell even paychecks from 20 days ago would have gone up 33%!
You have something that has risen 500% in 6 weeks and picking out a quick 6 hour period where things to drop to call the man stupid.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:02:11
I would say most complaints were with delays.  During the initial surge they had so much volume, the delays were inevitable.  People want instant service and a lot of times takes a few days to verify and get coins to you.  If you are a long term investor, I think you should have no problems at all.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:29:21

Actually the people who probably have benefited the most of them are the very early users.  The people who liked the idea, had enough knowledge of how to mine AND kept them after not being worth more than pennies for years.

Right now the best you thing you can do is mine one the altcoins and trade them for BTC on one of the exchanges.
