For some use cases yes, but it looks increasingly likely that we will live in a world of many blockchains, bitcoin will adopt many features developed on altcoins, but the idea that a dating dapp such as matchpool could run its entire service on bitcoins blockchain to the same scale and standards that are available through Ethereum, EOS, cardano or Iota is simply insane. I belive once LN is up and running bitcoin will steal back thousands of users from its competitors, but the idea that RSK for example, is able to keep pace with these other major platforms seems incredibly unlikely. Not to mention that even if they could offer the same level of service there really is very little incentive to switch from their current platform of  choice.
Even right now if someone is building decentralised uber, or a decentralised exchange. Bitcoin even with segwit and LN can not support the needs for hundreds of thousands of transactions per second with less than 2 second validation times, not to mention more advanced integration with services and other dapps such as IPFS for example.

I agree with him. I also think there are many other alts with crazy strong technology and teams that are simply too far in to switch and will have first to market advantages.
Augur, Walton, EOS, Status. Even funfair, a casino dapp had working channel payments live almost a year ago now. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:48:57
I see no decentralised prediction markets on bitcoin, or decentralised file storage or computing power, no decentralised messaging, decentralised blogging network. All of these are working right now on other blockchain, so yes they are first.

I think his point is that if we've made it on a couple of blocks before and continue growth of this speed then 1 block/month becomes 5, 5 become 25, 25 becomes 200, before you know it there are genuine delayed expected. Out needs fixing as a top priority.

So refreshing to see someone who actually gets it.
I consider myself a socialist, although a little more central than "real" socialism. And I see glimpses of it in almost every crypto project. Mining in Bitcoin is inherently socialist in how it was designed to work originally. The idea of everyone who uses the network using their own hardware to benefit from their support of this shared infrastructure. Tokenisation as a concept, the ability for anyone to buy into the infrastructure they believe in, and share the profits. Many altcoins act similarly to co-op company structures. There is still potential for decentralised distributed power grids, owned by the communities they serve and the people who maintain it. Some cryptos work to consolidate wealth, proof of stake, master odes etc. But some have decentralised governance that redistribute wealth, some have experimented in taxation at a protocol level, universal basic income etc.
The way crypto libertarian capitalists parade Venezuela around pretending a dictatorship is the same as socialism is embarrassing. Both systems can work, in my opinion 1 is inherently always leading to monopolies, it isn't socialism, at least not if it is done through decentralised, distributed democracy.
I now await the hate.

It's a sponsorship deal, eToro could have just paid in GBP, but they wanted to make a point that with some explanation and negotiating even premier league football clubs are willing to take a chance on accepting it as payment.  
eToro probably had to pay much more than if they had used GBP, but that's really nothing exciting. The people here who are amazed seeing the ads around the stadium are missing the point, that's not the big news, eToro has been advertising during rush our on the London Underground and major railway stations, on the side of Taxi's in London, Edinburgh and Manchester. The exciting bit, is that they convinced these massive companies to actually use real bitcoin.  
Disclaimer: Popular Investor on eToro so potentially bigging them up a bit.

I don't think anyone here should be looking at reddit subscribers as an indicator to success. Dogecoin started life as a meme, as such it is more likely to have a following on websites where memes circulate, reddit, 4chan, 9gag whatever.
The best way to measure growth and success is with real world metrics. The number of businesses that are adopting dogecoin compared with bitcoin is minuscule, the amount of investment going into it from VC's is again minuscule, the number of wallets downloaded, the total market cap, media coverage it is all extremely low right now.
I'm not saying dogecoin won't continue to grow and perhaps it is catching bitcoin, but it's got a long way to go before it's likely to be an issue.
That being said I agree with the general point behind this post (that news about dogecoin, litecoin, peercoin and such should not be so heavily downvoted.) - Will anyone  listen, probably not, things will still get downvoted despite being interesting and relevant discussion.

I trade stocks along with cryptos. The bit you care about:
$34.1 Million of Bitcoin sales through Square last quarter.
Only $200,000 profit (so for once not charging an absolute fortune to their customers).
During the earnings call a few weeks ago there were 5 questions about Bitcoin/Blockchain vision for Square going forward. They have a dedicated blockchain team at Square who are looking at potential use cases, that's pretty much all for now.
On a side-note Square also announced their plans to acquire a small website creation service called Weebly, similar to Wix or Square Space to try and compete more online with the likes of Shopify.
Since Shopify allows it's customers to accept Bitcoin I fully expect this is also in Squares plans for Weebly.
Edit: Disclaimer, I am invested in Square, Weebly, Twitter and Bitcoin ;)

Although, real estate on the stream itself is also important to remember, most streamers have a webcam, some have music, some have top donators, some have sponsors, this competes with it all for space too. Some genius needs to invent scannable video/images that aren't visible to the naked eye and then all you'd need us a tiny symbol showing that it's scannable :p.Still very cool to see that bitcoin is so good at what it does that it's winning the real estate battles more and more. :)

Honestly, I think if anything the Protocol is what needs renaming, "Bitcoin" is a logical name for a currency, but not for a protocol that has nothing to do with coins.
If you ask a person on the street what bitcoins would mean to them they would assume the currency, not the protocol. I'm not saying that the protocol is less important (in fact I think the protocol is going to lead to some hugely awesome tech in the coming years).. but let's think about this logically.

Windows phone pretty much sits in the middle of Android and IOS, it's more customizeable than IOS (especially with 8.1 coming soon), but less so than android. It's the phone I recommend to old people too, very simple and intuitive to use, but without the price tag of Apple.
As far as apps go, excluding Bitcoin there really are no problems any more, every mainstream app is available on WP, and for those that aren't there are normally a few 3rd party solutions.
I had two android phones before my 920 and the thing I love about it most is how stable and fast it is, it doesn't seem to slow down with age, nor does it randomly freeze or lag (except in a few badly made apps).
Personally I don't agree with Apple as a company, and I want something easier than android. Honestly I was also very swayed by Nokia's cameras :p.

Every time I bring this up it simply gets ignored as "oh that OS has like 10 apps right?"
Or about how nobody uses it, I'm not some uber fanboy, I used android for a long time.. I just think it's incredibly stupid that people keep overlooking this and doing as you did, making jokes of it.
I'd go so far as to say that whoever builds a wallet for WP first will probably enjoy a healthy influx of users.

I agree, and it is my understanding that Havelock only gives those coins to the company monthly as required, until then holding them in escrow. What they operate is a fund, and so there is still a chance that they may have a number of coins that would presumably be given back if this company has indeed gone under or been involved in fraud.
For now all we can do is wait and see, but the signs don't look great.

Honestly I'm just too lazy to spend 2-3 days researching fully how to setup and use paper wallets.
It feels like there are no big brands associated to paper wallets that could make the process simple enough for me to put in the effort, for now at least I'd rather keep my passwords secure, use two factor auth (if circle allows it) and perhaps multiple accounts than invest so much time/effort into paper wallets.

He'd support it to a point, but I think (like me incidentally) that he would have a small issue with the idea that in the future it will be easy to horde and another 0.1% elite will again have control over the world (although certainly not as bad as right now with the state in control).
Taxes and a state ARE important to society imo, the key is ensuring that it sticks to the important things and is decentralized and democratic.
I'd hate to see a world where nobody can get important things such as firefighters, public transport, education or healthcare without going through huge private companies. I suspect Russell shares this view with me since he is very socialist leaning. As much as Bitcoin is a huge step forward for personal freedom and cutting out banks and state controlled money there are still potential problems of people tax avoiding for the very basics. I'm not talking about funding wars or politicians hefty salaries, but the things that 90% of the population believe are important.

Blockchain size is still a problem. Why I hear you ask? Because desktop PC's and even Laptops are dying out in favour of mobile phones and tablets for normal end users, and they use flash/ssd's.
Cloud storage could help out, and there will always be those who own PC's for gaming or more heavy work stuff, but we still face a problem that the number of people storing the full block chain will hit a cap and start to decrease as it continues growing. Most average computers are not going to have even 2TB of storage, if I go to my local supermarket of choice and look at their standard PC's and laptops most are equipped with 500gb hard drives, maybe 1TB, people won't want to dedicate maybe 15-20% of their storage to a bitcoin wallet.
For mobiles and tablets the situation is much worse, right now even high end smartphones when loaded up with apps and other usual data will simply not have the space for storing the blockchain.
I don't think we're in an imminent danger, but the capacity and price of ssd's is what needs to change, not HDD's.

But large in the areas that matter most for Bitcoin; India, China, Africa and Latin America, not to mention a huge chunk of Europe.
It's a cop out excuse, in several of these countries the market share is higher than IOS, and unlike IOS Windows never had anything negative to say towards Bitcoin.
Oh, and because there are currently zero good Bitcoin wallets on WP, they would get close to 100% of WP users to use their wallet over any competitors simply for being first to market.
With the amount of VC funding available to companies like BC, CB and others I genuinely struggle to find a proper reason for not developing an app, and yes I know the costs involved before someone comes screaming in with that arguement.

I'm no expert.. But would it not be possible for the protolcol to be changed so that it somehow creates decentralized pools of its own and these 3rd party pools became obsolete? There must be a way of doing this using bitcoin's own network. We've all seen the potential future uses, im sure this would fit in there somehow.

One of the guys responsible for the entire Pirate Party movement, a huge contributor to internet freedom/anti-censorship AND helped create/run the worlds largest websites of all time utilizing the biggest DECENTRALIZED network before Bitcoin, not to mention all of his other projects such as hemlis and flattr, don't be silly.
He is probably among the top 50 biggest contributors to the internet in history, whether or not you agree with his political views or piracy it cannot be denied.

Maybe Bitcoin should itself become a pool and share out block rewards between everyone according to mining power used instead of just a winning pool, and decentralize the whole thing ofc. Am I missing something, is there a reason this can't be done? Big open source decentralized pool that takes no cut and has no owners?

And i will counter your downcotes with up votes, like it or not a bitcoin company that's lost millions of dollars is newsworthy. This community should not be about only showing to the moon posts or hype, it should encourage debates and discussion and layout news articles good or bad for all to see.I'm fed up with these downvote negative stories, or downvote jokes and meme comments. People need to grow up and just learn to think for themselves, we are here because we share an interest in this crazy decentralized experiment, but that doesn't mean we all need to agree on everything, and people should stop trying to sway the community.

my two most frequented reddits, I accept full responsibility, sorry :(.
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:12:54
The size of the market is what matters, growth can't continue forever, and although they have a solid chance to corner the Asian market, AMZN, EBAY, OSTK and a few others have already cornered the US and EU markets. Which spend much more money per customer.
Add to this that AMZN has begun to really make a name for itself with other services such as Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Servers and intelligent purchases such as Twitch.TV and it becomes ludicrous to consider BABA to be worth More than both EBAY and AMZN combined (which at it's current market cap it is).
Personally I'll be waiting for it to be sub $70 before I consider investing, and I wouldn't expect their sales growth this year to be anything more than 30%, probably more towards the 20-25% range.
Again, I'm not arguing that they aren't a great company with huge potential, just that their IPO valuation is very inflated, the same as FB and TWTR were when they IPO'd. Now their values are back to their IPO levels, but this time they are justified.

Uh... actually it kinda is.. utilizing percentages.. :\ I think you need to go study some maths a little more.
Although I semi-agree with your point. Bitcoin won't grow exponentially forever, it will hit its market share eventually and when it does it will slow down. Oh, and nobody knows how big it's market share will be, it could be 0.01% of world money or 99%. Personally I'm pretty confident it will hit at least 1% eventually, which would put the price pretty high :).

Yep, the guy above is an idiot, one size does not fit all, most people simply lack the time to learn about all of this, and although overall knowledge of roughly how it works will increase as popularity rises, 90% of people don't want to know how the blockchain or private and public keys work.People often talk about properties of money, fungibility, portability and so on. What they forget to include is ease of use. Bitcoin is not easy right now, Circle, Coinbase, blockchain and so on are trying to fix that. They are almost as important as the course code of bitcoin in ensuring it's success.

I recall hearing 5-6 years thrown around when the arrest warrants went out for them all.
As for parasites, I disagree, it's providing a service that people want, let's not forget that until very recently digital downloads and legal streaming platforms did not exist. If you wanted to buy a movie or album you'd go spent £20 for the privilege, and it wasn't even digital, when ipods, smartphones and tablets were becoming the popular method of media consumption the movie industry PURPOSEFULLY neglected it in favour of continuing to earn big profits.
Without the early risk taking innovations such as TPB and such we'd probably still be waiting for these services and still paying extortionate prices for content on out-dated platforms. Not to mention that the artists get paid more under self-publishing systems such as amazon, spotify and netflix than going with record and movie labels.
As a method of distribution it is much faster, cheaper and more efficient than the current movie/music industry, all that's needed is for some clever nerds to get together and figure out a way of building bitcoin micro-payments into bit-torrent software and boom, another industry disrupted for the better of everyone (except the huge companies who want their cut for distribution).

Personally I agree, I think that if we want bang for buck eSports is the way to go, Dogecoin spent $50,000 for 2 races in Nascar.. the same money in eSports would be enough to become a title sponsor for a tournament at Dreamhack, EVO or ESL.. we're talking hundreds of thousands of concurrent viewers, millions over the course of the full event to an audience who are likely to actually be interested in Bitcoin and have the technical knowledge to understand and use it without losing all their money. On top of that you could probably arrange for the prize money to be given out in Bitcoin to the participants.
For me Bitcoin is still nowhere near user friendly enough for the average person, so we should only advertise it to the people interested in technology who are computer literate. eSports is perfect.

To all those in here who argue that Basic Income is not necessary, or simply don't believe jobs are disappearing I collected a few examples of why I believe BI will eventually take over our current welfare systems.
- Self-service computers are replacing retail and receptionist jobs already
- Warehouse jobs are already on the slide
- Driving jobs are next to go
- Vertical farming will mix up the agriculture industry
- 3D printing will begin to disrupt the manufacturing industry in 15-20 years
- 3D printed buildings are next in line
- AI will eventually take over much of the medical industry
- Robots are already beginning to take over delicate operations
- Robots are also destined to take over military operations and even police roles in the future
- Don't forget planes, both military and civilian, already pilots are only used on commercial airlines for take-off and landing only unless there are complications
I presume I need not mention the jobs bitcoin's technology can potentially replace.
These were just the jobs I could think of from the top of my head, there are more under threat if you dig around enough, sure these changes won't happen over-night, but if you honestly believe that the world can still work without basic income in some form 20 years from now I think you're deluded.
It is ironic though that Bitcoin could potentially make implementing such a model difficult, but when the demand is big enough things will have to head in that direction.

As usual another un-informed individual. 7 people huh..
In Italy windows phone has 17.1% market share, by comparison ios has 12.5%, in the UK, USA, Germany, France and many more windows phone grew substantially last year. It is now ranked above ios in 24 countries. I'm not saying don't develop for ios.. but at the end of the day there are hundreds of millions of windows phones out there now who have no access to any wallets.
If this were the PC market you'd effectively be saying "oh don't worry about apple, they only have 7 users.." their market share for PC's is almost exactly the same as windowsphone share for smartphones.
In europes 5 biggest markets windows phone is at 9.8% market share, ios is at 14.6%, if the dev's are happy to spend time working on a platform that is actively working against them but not for one that is as open as android then those dev's are fucking retarded.

Yah, I see your point.. But I guess the theory is that if we spend enough at the retailers, they see lots of success in bitcoin and ask suppliers if they accept it to further save themselves conversion fees back to usd..?The other thing that could impact it is publicity, if for example transactions on bbf are huge and all the companies are celebrating their sales, and consumers celebrating low prices that gets coverage which gets more people interested in bitcoin and more buying pressure?Seems like there are several ways we could go about strengthening the economy.. But as you said how things are now is what's responsible for the selling pressure.

What is bad about hundreds of people rallying to try and get a tournament, what exactly is their motive? They aren't earning anything from it, they want the tournament because they want a good event and want to watch, them promoting it is the entire point, if the community embraces it then more people will find out about it, and as such bitcoin.
The goal of these tournaments is to expose more people to bitcoin, and a community that wants to help do that can only be a good thing.

Not really, since just like the real world economy right now there are plenty of ways of making money simply by having money. In stocks and property for example.
Not only that but since Bitcoin is deflationary in theory if they had enough money they could live off it's ever increasing purchasing power without ever needing to do anything, just by owning it.

For those not familiar eToro is one of the worlds biggest stock trading platforms geared towards low level investors and "normal people".
I used to have a reasonable chunk of money in shares via a different website but since moved a lot of it into Bitcoin back in 2012.. I still really like trading shares so decided I wanted to trade again at a smaller scale. I signed up for eToro with their 50$ bonus, and it lets you invest it into 1 of the 3 things, the first option: Bitcoin!
So in it went, despite the fact that this was meant to be my new hedge against Bitcoin (not that I think it's likely to fail..).
Disclosure: Not a serious investor, don't work for eToro or anything like that, and not advising anyone go put money into anything they don't want to.

I'm part of that crowd, why not? F1 has a younger more tech savvy viewership than nascar, and hey it's cheaper too. Seems like it would be awesome, and with the tipping culture here recently I'm sure its achievable.I'd love to see this happen.

How insured is it? Because honestly I'm looking for a wallet to use instead of QT (running out of HD space rapidly) and even as tech savvy guy, I simply don't trust myself hosting a wallet with potentially thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars in it going forward.
Circle seems like the safest bet so far, but I've heard that their insurance only covers something like $100..?

And despite the focus on the duel that was pointed out in the dogecoin thread there will undoubtedly be attention on Caterham for managing to return via crowd funding, something that's never been done in the sport before, and if the Bitcoin community is one of its biggest donators then that's huge.
Also don't forget that F1 is a sport followed a global audience unlike Nascar.

It frustrates me how people STILL shun Windows Phone, it has almost 20% market share in some countries and has grown steadily the past 3 years.

And yet ironically without bit-torrent's innovation bitcoin might not exist right now, bit-torrent is what started decentralization on the web.
As for property rights, there are still a lot of conflicting arguements about how much piracy actually hurts content creators.
I can't remember who it was, but 1 director (I think) was quoted saying something along the lines of "I love piracy, because if something gets pirated it shows that it's good, and i want as many people to enjoy the content as possible." Totally guessed that, but I'm sure if you google (yes i was too lazy) you'll find it.. I think it was from Game of Thrones or something.
Not only that, but what exactly is Peter Sunde's crime? Creating a neutral website to allow people to share files.. he created a tool that was used for piracy, but has legitimate uses as well. Does that deserve more jail time than armed robbery? Not in my opinion.

You're right, we should totally advertise to the over 50's yet to figure out smart-phones and e-mail.
Have you not stepped outside of the little bubble world we all inhabit? Bitcoin is NOT user friendly right now, it is nerd friendly or requires a big time investment to learn/understand.
Not to mention the fact that as far as marketing goes advertising to eSports is clearly the best choice right now for multiple reasons, here I'll list a few and let's see if you can think of something that'll give better value:
- eSports sponsorships are relatively cheap, 15-20k will buy you a top sponsor position on many international teams for a full year
- eSports reaches the perfect demographic, 70% males between the age of 15-25, computer literate, just entered/entering the world of being financially responsible for themselves
- eSports fans are extremely passionate, this is the industry which started by people volunteering their own money to run events and support players with no hope of any return ever, the communities actively work to reward sponsors and players/teams are truly grateful for the money.
- eSports is global, unlike Nascar for example you will reach people in China, Korea, Israel, Spain, Sweden, the UK, Canada, Brazil, Russia equally.
- Because it's global there is a lot of friction Bitcoin can remove, I run one of the worlds largest eSports tournament websites, and I know the extreme fees involved in getting prizemoney to players/teams in different countries around the world, Bitcoin is the perfect solution for this, we can change an entire industry!
- eSports players travel the world, so having 1 currency they can use anywhere won't be a hard sell to them
- viewing numbers for eSports have been exploding over the last 5 years since streaming technology took a leap forwards, big events can draw over 20 million unique viewers over a weekend, there are tens of these events per year that a sponsored team would potentially be participating in!
So please, downvote me more for taking a sensible view on this, I know for a fact that most people in this reddit can understand why it's the best use of any "marketing" money right now.

No regulation is better than bad regulation.

There's still plenty of hope, I have 1.5BTC in there too, "abnormal activity" could mean anything from insider trading to some sort of theft or price manipulation. I should also mention that havelock does'nt simply give all of those BTC to the company in which they are invested, they are held in escrow on cold storage until that company needs the money, so it's unlikely you'd lose all your bitcoins if the company did just die and go under.

@_date: 2014-08-30 22:07:31
I personally make money from stock trading, realistically it's very easy to pick some safe stocks with high dividends to earn money. It doesn't offer anything to society, so you are managing your money well, good for you, not so good for the wider economy, the money doesn't come from thin air, it comes from other people losing theirs. Not to mention that these days if you're part of the 0.1% you likely use trading bots to do your work for you.
Contribution to wider society: nothing, it's just leeching money off less wise investors.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is necessarily wrong (as I said, I trade shares myself), but the potential to survive in a luxury life while your bots trade for you and you sit on the couch watching TV all from money that potentially you never even earned in the first place is potentially very damaging to the wider economy in the long-term.
Again, I offer no solutions though.

To be fair he stutters that much no matter what the subject. It's clear he's not quite as well informed on Bitcoin as we all hoped he would be, but I think it's a little naive to assume that all he knows about it is silk-road related, afterall he founded paypal, several Tesla's have Bitcoin numberplates and i have no doubts that the Bitcoin community has lobbied them to accept Bitcoin.
Give him some time and he'll see it's true promise :).
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:43:14
I personally think they should have staggered their launch with a torrent being released a few weeks later than the paid version. If they did that and informed the community about it in advance, chances are very few people would distribute it early and would instead either pay for the vimeo version or wait for the torrent.
But OP is right, taking control of the pirated version is the best thing they can do.

You're right ofc.. and I know that there is at least 1 solo dev working on a wallet right now. But realistically we are talking about peoples money here, it is unlikely that people will trust "dave's bitcoin wallet" app as much as for example coinbase or blockchain.info.
There's no real point to this rant of mine, I'm not desperate for a wallet yet so feel no need to go around trying to sell the idea of it to a dev.
Just wanted to raise a little awareness among the community to the fact that while yes android is a brilliant alternative, everyone seems to have forgotten that many people won't want to go buy an entire new phone just for a bitcoin wallet, and for apple users unfortunately they get kinda screwed.. but for windows phone there is nothing stopping these companies from helping drive up adoption.

Is it? Sure, in the next 3 years it's not, but the world changes, people don't want bulky pc's anymore, hard drives don't fit in smartphones or tablets. The pc market is likely to shrink massively, if everyone uses wallets that don't store the blockchain then that kills decentralization, which is crucial to bitcoins success.

Realistically speaking you do have to wonder why the heck Economics and even Politics in general don't receive any attention in schooling, it seems that the only way to learn either is by going into further education or being very curious on the internet.
I for 1 was taught nothing about either in school, finished my education then 10 years down the line discovered that they are the two subjects I am most interested in and would have loved a carear in. Obviously things like Maths, Science and &lt;insert your language here&gt; are important, but the fact that these subjects receive less attention than things like Art, Metalwork and Religious education is extremely troubling.
And because I didn't learn about it when I was younger I can't get into politics and go fix the situation! &gt;_&lt;
Fuck! :(

He's almost great... almost but it feels like he lacks any real policies behind his fancy words, he's anti-capitalist, anti-state, anti-monarchy but has he started any sort of political movement? No, in fact he encourages people to simply not bother and "have a revolution" whatever the fuck that is meant to mean.
If he started or joined a political party and began to work towards solutions to the issues he discusses I'd have much more respect for him.
All that said, he did fuck Katy Perry and is also pretty funny so I let it slide.

Random blogger has clearly never even used the website. If course it will look like I have an agenda.. Fact is I have made enough money that I don't need to shill. I'm not here saying etoro is perfect or better than other exchanges. Just pointing out that you are showing misinformation.

I'm paid for trading with copiers funds, millions of dollars of it. Not to lie. I was not a popular investor for several years. My own parents use this website. I have called out etoro when they have made mistakes in the past, the fact is that what you stated is a total lie.
Real stocks are traded.
Real crypto is traded.
Cfd is not the same as binary options, the positions are not timed, the fees uses the standard libor rate as a base.
Cfd's are only used for shorting and leverage. 
Etoro is in the middle of filing of their own crypto wallet.
Please, stop spreading FUD. By all means say you don't like the high spread, or you think the popular investor system sucks. But the product does exactly what it says it does.

I've been using etoro almost as long as I've been holding bitcoin (separately). Over 5 years now. 
This article is absolute junk.
It does not know the difference between binary options and cfd's.
Etoro uses real stocks and real crypto. Cfd's are only used for shorting or leveraged trading. They are fully regulated. I've visited their offices in Tel Aviv and London, met the Ceo a few times, and have several friends who work there. I'm also the most successful social trader on the website partially due to my crypto experience.
It seems to me like some people have an agenda to make etoro look bad or dodgy in some way. The reality is almost the polar opposite.

I've been using etoro for my investing outside of my real cryptocurrency for around 4 years now, and have over time I've become the most popular trader on the platform due to my crypto knowledge with over 8,000 other traders invested in my "fund". It's proven to be a great way for some of my less techie friends to benefit from the increasing value of cryptos, and the company are actually really keen to support the overall crypto communities, they sponsor a bunch of the meetups in London too. :)

Uninformed opinion yet again. 
Etoro offer real stocks and real crypto. Cfd's are used only for shorting or using leverage.
I've been using etoro for 5 years, visited their Tel Aviv and London office, met the ceo numerous times, am friends with several staff members.
It gets so boring reading these comments.. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 10:16:35
Wrong again, self employed with two members of staff of my own. Etoro pay me as a contractor for my services as a popular investor. I have also taken paid consultancy work from other companies, and have other streams of revenue. Trust me, I wish my taxes were as simple as being employed by them.

Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror Season 3 episode 1 is an hour long episode based inside a very similar dystopian future, where users can rate each other and the higher your rating the more perks you get in life.
Some of his earlier episodes also touch on the subject. Season 3 is available on Netflix I believe, and the earlier seasons are available on 4oD in the UK.

Not only that, I'm getting tired of the memes in general, dollars coming out of laptops, moon landings and rocket gifs, people using cash as tissues.
I get the excitement and the memes are funny, but we're losing focus on the actual product here. More news, more discussion, more debate, that's what we need.
I've been on this sub since 2013 and this is the worst I've seen it.
@_date: 2016-12-25 22:20:06
There are more points in this post that I can agree with.
Yes companies do need cash reserves, but as we saw in court recently with Apple share holders this can become an issue when it gets too high. Apple have enough reserves to continue operating without selling a single product for over 10 years.
While you're correct in the point of solar panels continuing to become more efficient you hopefully are also on-side with the climate change issue, where our 2 degrees of global warming prediction from 10 years ago is now in fact the BEST case scenario, and while the world aimed to limit CO2 and 300 parts per million we have now breached 400. As a result I personally believe governments should utilise tax payer money to incentive adoption via subsidies or tax breaks etc.
The issues I do not agree on are as follows:
The issue you mentioned about birth rates is currently true, but science is unanimous that once countries have improved their standards of living birth-rates drop off dramatically. It is the disease/malnutrition through poor countries that are the biggest influence on birth rates. Some countries have gone from an average of 5 children per family down to 2 per family in just 15 years, Iran is a good example of this. Fixing food shortages/quality is part of what will assist fixing the overpopulation issue. (Yes, I was surprised when I discovered this too). The UN released a report suggesting that global population will likely never exceed 11 Billion, and won't hit 10 Billion until 2050.
Let's also not forget that farming technology is still improving, producing this food is not likely to be the problem, only distributing it and ensuring it is affordable for all.
Finally the money being distributed via inflation tax. While this is true, we're all on this subreddit supporting Bitcoin and a big part of that for most people here (and I suspect probably you) is the limited supply. What happens if that money becomes deflationary? The problem will get worse.
I've enjoyed this debate btw, hopefully you haven't been too offended by my comments. Personally I want to live in a world where the planet is sustainable and where everyone has equal opportunities and a basic standard of living for all which includes education/housing/food/health care.
You may disagree on the specifics but I believe most people agree on those points.
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:38:40
Unfortunately you are only partially correct.
Firstly your example of his money doing work invested in companies:
I'll use your example of coca-cola. They have cash reserves of around 8bn right now. Their market cap is 180bn. Un-like solar panels Coca Cola is not contributing to the well-being of the planet. Their largest internal budget is marketing. They fuel un-nessecary consumerism.
Second point: Solar panels is an example, and my example was set in the UK, ideally a scheme like this would be government rolled out and have a huge subsidy and allow people to "pay off" the price of the panels with the power they generate. Obviously solar panels will not work in the slums of India but investments into for example housing instead WOULD work there.
Each country and region is different, I'm not proposing that they don't make money off it and do it all for free, nor am I proposing that it will be easy or there is one solution that can be applied everywhere, but there are trillions of dollars globally that are sitting in bank accounts or wasted frivolously.
Even if he gave that money away to the starving people of Yemen via a universal income it would likely do more good for the world, people could pay for education, no longer worry about buying food, or even start a new business, heck they could mine bitcoins and help secure the network.
The overall point here is that resources should not be horded, nobody should be allowed to construct monopolies, and companies/individuals should be incentivised to create tangible measurable change for good.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:09:23
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:26:34
Because the combined excess wealth of the top 50 richest individuals is enough to wipe out hunger globally. Because if they invested that money without expecting returns they could bring entire nations from the brink of disaster up to decent standards of living.
Nobody should have the right to sit on that much wealth/resources and purposely 'sandbag' the entire planet purely for greed.
Let's take warren buffet as an example. Currently his net worth is around $62,000,000,000 - Assuming a set of solar panels for a house costs $4000, he could give jobs to millions of people and help save the planet by buying 15,000,000 of them. That's enough for every single residential building in the UK.
And even then he would still have $2bn to enjoy a nice big house with fast cars and perhaps own a company or two with.
I'm all for people becoming millionaires, EVEN a billionaire, but there comes a point where money is being wasted.

Let's get real for a second though. Although 95% of alts are worthless rip offs or straight up bad ideas there are plenty that are indeed valuable. Ethereum and it's big apps are the best example. Bitcoin is focused on becoming a store of value, decentralized of course. Augur offers something totally different, it has huge potential value, perhaps not as high as Bitcoin, but still huge as a decentralised prediction market. What about steem, again huge potential as a decentralised social network. When I talk to people about blockchain tech this is what I mean. With regards to currency, even then projects such as Dash, Pics etc still have a lot of merit, they test new ideas that if successful can be used by Bitcoin potentially and importantly they add competition so that should Bitcoin fail we have alternatives.

Hey everyone. I'm Jay, the guy in the photo. Here to dispel some myths.
1. My etoro portfolio is risk managed and only ever a maximum of 50% exposed to crypto, by that logic I have outperformed Bitcoin slightly. (295% *2 = 590)
2. I also hold crypto outside etoro that I trade with (less actively). YTD my profit measured in BTC is around 11%.
3. The Bloomberg article was clearly geared towards making me come across as a lucky fool.  Here are some stats on my trading (primarily in stocks until very recently).
- I have been trading for 10 years
- 80% of my liquid assets are in crypto excluding my etoro holdings
- my crypto holdings are 75% hodl split across btc, eth, dash, nem, pivx, omg, neo and augur.
- 25% of my crypto is traded via bittrex and others in over 20 different crypto
- in my traditional trading on etoro and before that share.com I made profit 9 years out of 10
- my average yearly profit is around 45% I would get the real number but I'm currently on holiday in Malaysia
- the one year I made a loss it was 2%, This was primarily the Mr.gox aftermath. ( I feel this proves how much my traditional investing is risk managed)
- that same year my real crypto that was primarily hodld lost over 40%.
I'm honestly very disappointed that this community which I have been part of for years now would shoot me down so quickly without seeking facts or considering that Bloomberg were wanting to work their own angle.
On etoro I have educated tens of thousands and introduced them to the world of crypto in a safe way, earning many of them over 300% of returns so far in a reasonably balanced portfolio. I expect I have directly introduced more holders to bitcoin than most of the people in this thread who are hating on me for not being a hodler. Watch my streams or videos, read my posts, you will see that although I'm no Charlie Lee or Andreas Antonopolis, I am honest, give the information I know and refer people to better resources including often this reddit when I'm unsure. 
Again, not here to start a debate or throw my toys out of the pram, but I am not a scammer, I'm a true hodler, a bitcoin and crypto enthusiast.
Feel free to ask more questions if you wish. I will try to respond quickly.

If some people decide they are happy to live in a small apartment playing games all day and eating noodles, so be it. They aren't hurting anyone.  
YOU are still free, like everyone else to innovate, get a job, volunteer, start a company, become a  politician, a stay at home parent, whatever you like.  
It's the typical "well obviously I'm different" attitude people seem to have... without asking anyone, they assume everyone would quit their jobs and stay at home doing nothing. Here's a game for you, go and ask people. Ask your friends, ask reddit.  
I'm fortunate enough to have found a way out of working pretty low salary jobs when I become successful at trading. Know what I did? I didn't lay around at home doing nothing, I built it into a business, then founded a second one with some friends, invested in a 3rd of another friend, and became politically active to the point where I'm contemplating if I should stand locally in the next election.  
I could only do those things because I was no longer worried about running out of money, feeding myself, paying the bills. I was free to pursue the things I love, and am good at. UBI can do this for everyone.

I'm so bored of the mis-information here it drives me insane.  
Disclaimer - I am technically paid by them as a popular investor, so could perhaps be seen as a little one sided  
Tackling the usual misconceptions one at a time. ["received $5 free credit, invested it in Bitcoin, checked on it last year and it was removed" - The credits came with clear terms and conditions, I used them when I first joined in 2013 as well. They were dsigned to allow you to earn the profit on any trades done within a 2 year period, eToro reserved the rights to modify these rules as well. These kinds of deals are super common on cfd websites as well as poker and gambling websites.  
["and they don't deal in real bitcoin" - wrong, eToro stopped using CFD's for long positions on crypto well over a year ago now, in fact, almost 2 years ago. The hold real bitcoin and partner with several exchanges to provide the liquidity. They are working on a wallet and the ability to withdraw/deposit cryptos into eToro.  
["eToro sells cfd's, you own nothing" - again this is misleading. eToro uses CFD's for short positions and leveraged positions. 1x long positions on stocks are now real stocks held by eToro on the users behalf, like real stocks you even receive the dividends.  
"not a gamble website who is advertising unknown people to sell fake bitcoin cfd" - Not sure if I'm one of the fake people you are reffering to, a popular investor on eToro. I'm very real I can assure you. As mentioned before, it is not a CFD if you have a 1x long position open, and soon you will be able to withdraw it if you like.  
"real criminals like eToro continue to operate" - It is clear at this point that you have never interacted with eToro. They were in the crypto space very early, Yoni Assia, the CEO worked directly with Vitalik Buterin who worked at eToro for a while. They are also incubating a crypto startup called CoinDash in their offices in Tel Aviv, I know because I've been there and met them. They created the leading force in crypto for the UK partnering with all other major UK based crypto companies to lobby the government, work with the media and set basic standards by which all members must abide (self-regulation). They have sponsored more meetups in the UK and Israel than any other company, and ask for nothing in return aside from their logo. Every week they pay for a bar and invite major movers and shakers in crypto to attend, this includes devs and influcners from across the entire industry and many different crypto projects. They have created sponsored listings of crypto prices in major newspapers in the UK, sponsored the london underground, taxi's and helped the media find well-versed people to defend crypto on tv and such.
They do more for the grass roots crypto community than they need to, in fact they do more than most other companies in the space.  
I've had to do this about 6 times on different reddits over the past year or so as people post this kind of stuff. Sucks that their reputation is clearly so tainted in some communities, but says a lot about how many people are willing to speak like an authority on something that they know nothing about.

I invested in Bitcoin in early 2013, I'm a bit nerdy, played around with a node, different wallets, services, exchanges etc.  
My dad was convinced by my to get some in 2014. Back then the only "safe" places that were reasonably noob friendly to my dad were Coinbase and Circle, Circle left the crypto space, so it was just Coinbase, but they were not yet easy to use from the UK. Instead he used eToro, made some great money over the past 4 years and still uses it today.  
Just because it has higher spreads does not mean it is "for suckers" - it is for people who do not understand how to use a normal exchange, for people who perhaps want it in a digestible format with an app on their phone.  
The disdain from this community to anyone who is not a nerd like them is unbearable recently. And as mentioned in my last post, eToro has done more work to promote crypto in Europe through marketing than any other company in my opinion.

I never said yours was misinformation, just a really dumb criticism.

As a stock and crypto trader, Ta is really useful for short to mid term, but it does not exist in some void. Fundamentals always dictate price long term. When people came to me asking why I stopped shorting at 7k and returned to my longs, and everyone was panicking about a death cross (lol). I had to remind them that last time it dropped this long and this fact, it's because the exchange controlling some 80% of all trading volume got hacked. Now we have lightning around the corner, bcashers are gone and hundreds of shitcoins have unraveled increasing trust in BTC. The situations could not be further apart. It went up too fast  some Mt. Gox stuff happened, it dropped too low and soon we will be sitting around 10k thinking, hey, that's still higher than 6 months ago.
Anyone who uses ta without fundamentals backing it up is sitting on a time bomb, just my opinion.

I do tend to agree with you on this, In fact generally when trading I ignore ratings from Moodys and the like. But when it hits 80%+ of people agreeing I take notice. Before Brexit every single major financial institution and bank in europe as well as most political leaders and economists came out against Brexit. It is at that point that I tend to take notice. Personally I do not believe that Brexit has yet been priced in fully to the GBP.
@_date: 2016-10-10 20:38:07
I agree entirely with everything you said here, but I can't think 25-50 years into the future without thinking 5 years into the future. In 5 years I will still be reliant on the GBP, thus I care about the effect Brexit has on it.
@_date: 2016-10-08 08:34:37
We're hardly going to become third world. But there is every chance we will be in a 4-5 year long recession. It's not doom and gloom, it's realism. GBP is a bad investment, anything tired to the UK isn't a great investment. That's all I'm saying.
@_date: 2016-10-09 18:23:17
Not at all, it would be pure ignorance to presume that when we actually fill in the paperwork everything stays the same as it is now. The same with companies deciding not to invest here, we already know it's happening because several companies have publicly said so. I will agree that measuring how bad that might be is very difficult and full of speculation, but to sit here and say "the bad things have happened now, it's over move on" is honestly just blind optimism.

Secondly, the one big thing I do still have on my side for IMMEDIATE claim is the GBP being at a 30 year low. This is not something small that you can shoo into a corner and discount. Effectively most of the country lost 16% of its wealth this year, that is not something to just ignore and accept as far as I am concerned.
@_date: 2016-10-07 08:55:56
Hardly, it's going to tank another 10% if/when article 50 is passed. Most the big ratings guys have it as a sell atm.Goldman Sachs predicted 5% drop by Xmas. I just dumped 70% of mine into a house, 5% in shares, 20% bitcoin and 5% left in gdp.

Brexit it's a terrible idea for the UK, things will get worse for another 5-10 years before they get better.
@_date: 2016-10-08 21:33:12
Because of several things.

1. We haven't left yet
2. It takes time for companies to react (change policies, build strategy for moving etc
3. The big hit is in a few years.. When &lt;insert company&gt; is looking to expand into europe normally they might consider UK, Germany, France now it is easier to rule out the UK.
4. EU is yet to 'punish' us with perhaps some import/export taxes

Also some of those numbers are easy to skew (although I concede its also possible they are accurate). Number of unemployed may simply mean lots of part time and zero hour contracts, it doesn't reflect on standard of living.

It's still too early to tell, it is perhaps going better than many economists expected right now, but as explained above many of it's effects are long-term.

Control what? The fisheries, that's a commonly used example.. yet there we were with one of the people leading the Brexit campaign at the head of the EU fisheries council. How many meetings did he attend? 0 of the 86 that happened while he was a member.

It's a myth that we will ever have the control we once had. It's also a never-ending cycle.. UK wants power back from EU, ok, Scotland, Wales, Ireland want power back from UK, ok, London wants power back from England. It's simply divisive. If the EU control so much why is it that nobody I ask can ever list more than "immigration" as something they control.

I agree. Brexit while slightly splitting our banking from the eu just encourages even greater corruption with less controls. The EU while they had their issues at least policed how much the banks can fuck people over, along with ensuring decent human rights, free movement of people etc. I'm fine with people wanting our sovereignty back, but it seems to me that we are handing it over to the elite here instead of the elite in europe.

Yes, I recently handed in my notice at work to trade full time on eToro.
I earn 2% of the assets under management for the users who copy me. eToro pays this to me monthly, the users still pay no additional fees.
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:07:14
I can understand that, I believe eToro do some trades behind the scenes for crypto's but I'm not sure. They are pretty big into crypto, I met the CEO a few months ago and he was showing me his BTCC wallet app on his phone :p.
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:06:07
Regulated :).
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:53:47
So they used to offer 5x leverage but removed it a few months ago, I was actually one of the people calling for them to remove it. With so many people who were new to Bitcoin and such high volatility since the start of the year I think the risk was too high for them to continue offering it when so many people were using it.
I think people copy me for both of those reasons. I'm quite well known for being extremely transparent about my trading and even the perks I get as a popular investor. I'm trying to focus on creating good quality content for people as well and helping educate people on cryptos especially. :).
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:04:00
I trade on a website called eToro (was trading before they added Bitcoin for a while, still trade lots of stocks) and the explosion of users they've had is unreal, primarily because people want to invest in cryptos.
It's like a trading social network, where you can "invest" your funds into other people who can trade on your behalf. Since I was one of the few traders there who understood Bitcoin/Cryptos my popularity boomed.
Making a joke about how these platforms are advertising their CFD's is all good and well, but I've seen the volume of users going to these platforms because they are regulated and easier to use than a normal exchange.
Don't get me wrong, 90% of my crypto holdings are in real wallets that I control, but these CFD websites are a huge boost to the wider economy and publicity cryptos get, and offer an easy solution for non-techies to invest safely.
Edit: Ok, wow did not expect that to somehow be an affiliate link through to the website I use, I swear this was not planned. But yeah, since I am one of the most influential investors on the website they are quite open about their growth as a platform. I believe I'm correct in saying that Ethereum and Bitcoin are the two most heavily traded assets from last month.

You joke, but in 5-10 years it could be. China is taking very sensible steps in slowly transitioning from rapid growth and manufacturing more towards a modern technology based economy. It's becoming more liberal, and contrary to popular belief it too has began to invest heavily in clean technologies. Still a very long way to go though, you cant change a country of that size over night.

Can I just say he's wrong about NFC. He claims it doesn't fix a problem, let's not forget NFC is comparable with bitcoin in theory, and instead of scanning a QR code then typing the amount NFC would allow you to just tap and it would automatically enter the address AND the amount to send. It's clearly not going to be as revolutionary as Bitcoin, but to say it has no real purpose is just stupid, In the future nobody will have cards or paper money in any shape or size and most in-person transactions will use NFC because QR codes are less reliable and more time consuming.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:13:51
Now yes, but if for example someone came to him with a 300 btc account and offered him 5% fee, the temptation to take it would be much greater.. It would take years to earn that much legitimately.

Imo this IS a good thing for Bitcoin.

Yeah, I tried phoning in to raise that point to him but couldn't get through, I also sent a text and an email explaining that people said they had "missed it" during all of the previous big price jumps, and that in comparison to even small countries the bitcoin economy is a drop in the ocean right now and has still got a huge amount of room to grow.

I can understand why they are considering it. I mean, they can quite happily charge a small fee, people wouldn't mind paying it because of the pure ease of use and the fact that paypal actually has some forms of insurance/security guarantees.
I suspect if this did happen the price of bitcoin could easily double or triple in value, not that anyone would want to cash out once that happens.

I remember seeing a talk about this and several other more long term features of Bitcoin on youtube somewhere. This tech is a long way away though, probably best to just release with an option to buy it with bitcoin for now. But you're right to be excited about the possibilities of it.

Without getting sucked into the debates i must agree fully with the OP, not all of us have a political agenda, and although bitcoin is more compatible with some ideologies than others doesn't mean those ideologies should be actively promoted here.There is a reasonable need to mention it in the history and the wiki's, but why on here? Mentioned when relevant yes, but promoted just coz. No, this should be addressed.

10% is way too high, I myself have a project that needs funding, I'm not sure if crowd funding is the right way for it yet, but I'd be needing 200,000  usd minimum, 20,000$ in fees is insane tbh the percentage should be between 1-5% and probably be capped to a certain figure.

Too much paypal hate in here, yes it's a bit too biased towards consumers, and yes sometimes it freezes funds, but how many of you have ever actually had a problem with it? Almost everyone i know has paypal.. Lets not forget what a huge leap it was from other options when it was created, and the potentially huge impact it could have on bitcoin growth if the adopted it in some way.By the way most people talk its as if paypal has seized all their money for no reason.
@_date: 2013-09-13 08:39:32
What I'm saying is that.. At worst case scenario it's not worthless shit, because the protocol and method of transferring bitcoins is a genuinely useful thing for society. Even if bitcoin as a currency fails, this protocol could still be used as a method for money transfer, and that gives bitcoins at least a tiny amount of value on it's own.

Good luck, no amount is to small to start with, don't be afraid to spend it if you want something, just rebuy the bitcoins afterwards
@_date: 2013-09-05 01:30:42
If you intend on using the money then I would suggest using one of the merchant services such as bitpay to exchange your Bitcoins for fiat upon receiving payment. However, in the long term it is likely that the value of your Bitcoins will increase, due to the market being so small the price still fluctuates quite a lot and events like this while not everyday are still quite common and should be expected. It's more than likely that the price will recover eventually, and long-term Bitcoin appears to be on a solid upwards trend.
My suggestion: If you really need the cash sell them now. If you can wait a few weeks then do just that and the value will probably lift back up a little (but don't quote me).
@_date: 2013-09-05 04:06:44

ofc there is, don't talk rubbish, I can be someone who believes in socialism and still find that having a currency which I can spend around the world is useful.
What nonsense.. not everyone looks 30 years into the future, the fact is that bitcoin's biggest strengths are
1. Being able to send/recieve very very cheaply
2. Almost instant
3. Can be used anywhere in the world.
Anyone who believes that you need to be an anarcho capitalist to use it is a total moron to be honest.

I don't think you can define it that easily. I suspect that most people on this reddit are in it for the currency, but also that at least 80% of those people are hoping to make profit from it as well. But yeah, I have no data to go off at all, but I suspect most of the speculators went out during the crash. Speculators are important though, it keeps the currency growing, and shows that people believe that what it offers is valuable.

I'm not sure what I'm wrong about from that quote.. it will help millions of people.. you're right it's not the cheapest thing to impliment, but Africa already has a very good network of mobile phone antenna's. They could simply skip the "broadband and 3G" stages of internet and go straight for 4G. This would only require upgrading their current infrastructure. No electricity? no problem, solar power is moving forward at a phenomenal rate, to the point where it is now almost as cheap as gas/coal. If that investment is unaffordable there is always the wind-up route, we've seen before laptops built with winders to power them.
Let's also not forget that Africa has huge adoption of mobile phones.. it seems logical that they will if given the opportunity upgrade to smart-phones for their internet requirements rather than buying PC's or laptops like western societies.
Again, I'm not arguing that this will help everyone, or is the cheapest option.. but in the long term it is probably more beneficial than many of the other options. You've cured maleria? Great now they will grow a bit older and starve to death with not enough water or food and not enough jobs.

If governments will make it easy to pay taxes with Bitcoin i'd do it for sure, not everyone wants to see government die, and if the government DID allow taxes to be paid in Bitcoin then the value would increase dramatically, so i'd be happy to pay them from the profit they would have made me.As much as governments waste money or spend it on things I don't want, i struggle to see how losing public schools, police, fire and health services could ever be a good thing for society.

I suspect we'll be at around 1000$ by the end of the year if things continue smoothly (no governments interfering, new exchanges open, less ddos/security issues).
But really it's pure guesswork, it depends on the world economies as well, if the Euro, Pound or Yen go under (which they all look at least a little bit wobbly) then it's anyone's guess what will happen.
Personally I don't want it to grow too fast, remember this currency needs to be a currency not a commodity, people need to be able to spend it or it's value will become more and more unstable as it becomes based more heavily on speculation.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:19:18
Don't worry, you're not alone. Bought a few BTC last night for 95$ despite knowing that it could drop when it hits 100$. I studied the charts, found two support lines, 1 at 88$ and 1 at 72$. So hopefully it will hold on at 72. In 4-5 days it'll be back up again.

It's exciting huh? 100 by the end of the day?
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:45:42
Yeah, check during the day, you can often buy 0.1 BTC minimum and you're likely to see the price drop to around £72-75 when more people are online. So £7.50 for 0.1, which for just testing the water and getting your first bitcoins is worth it imo. I actually used it for all of my purchases (over £1000 worth in total). The cool thing is that when lots of people are online they are constantly trying to under-cut each others prices. :).

Yeah, I realise that currently they use "dumb" phones, but there is no reason why the new wave of cheap android phones which many think will finally breach the $25 mark in 2014 aren't viable for these people. Now ofc this isn't cheap enough yet for the really poor, but it is viable for example 1 person per family to get 1.
I agree that this is not the only thing that should be done, but I think that if you fix the many diseases that are killing off people in Africa you will just make the food shortage worse. imo it's better to get the nation online so that the people can start trading and communicating with the outside world so that when these diseases are treated the citizens have enough tools to grow their countries without huge waves of aid.
What i'm saying is that as you rightly say, resources are thin. So is it better to prolong lives now or to increase productivity now so that prolonging lives becomes more affordable in the coming years?
If money is being spent keeping people alive but those people have no way of earning a living what are we really fixing? Ofc the internet alone would not be enough to ensure everyone can earn a living, but it certainly helps.

A good point, but they would also be taking a big risk, that would be an open invitation to any other similar services or rivals to back bitcoin, and then ltc could lose a lot of value and paypal could end up out-of-pocket. Not to mention that far less people actually own any litecoins right now, and litecoins are much less accessible than bitcoins currently. Unless they were to also open an exchange it would be a huge risk for little more reward than they would get by simply using bitcoins.

Yeah, i don't think anyone can seriously believe that socialism to that extreme will happen any time soon, especially now that bitcoin is here. Also: disclaimer, I'm not a socialist, just using it as an example.Unless we know satoshi's ideology it's hard to describe it as a product of libertarianism.Again, it does deserve mentions since clearly a big chunk of early adopters are libertarians, but right now it feels a bit like if i do research on churches and get Christianity thrown at me. Churches can be used by many religions, i feel like the same applies here although a little less extreme.Just my opinion, not trying to hate on libertarians or anything. :)Edit: seems i got sucked in lol..

Put simply, the trend is upwards, tracking the bottom candles and top candles you can see where both lines cross is where (roughly) the price should break through the wall.. it broke early, and went far too high, It's unlikely that it would drop below that wall.
It'l stay strong at 150 as a minimum, that's the new line of support.
It's known as an ascending triangle.. It's a good thing.. google it if you want to see more information. I'm not an expert, but i've been trading shares of companies long enough to at least know this much.

I don't see physical bitcoins becoming as big as some people think. The internet is still growing at a phenomenal rate, and with first world countries slowly moving towards 4G, fibre optic and NFC technologies why would anyone feel the need to carry physical bitcoins. As for the less developed countries sms messaging and the spread of 3G are again likely to mean physical bitcoins are not popular. By the time bitcoin is big enough for this to be a potential problem most people will have a solid stable internet connection readily available to them, and will opt for the digital version instead.Well, that's my opinion at least.

Worst case scenario you are 50% down, but in the long run it will most likely recover.Don't care if i sound like a dickhead for saying it but if you saw it on the news invested loads knowing you wont be in it for the long run then the world might be a little better without these people around making decisions.

Well, you're half right, Indeed the optimal way to run things would be to spread the work evenly, but it isn't likely to happen, at least not effectively. How do I know this..? because it's not happening now. In fact the opposite is happening, people are working for longer because their savings are worth crap, pensions suck and all the rest of it.
In the UK for example it is expected that my generation (generation X) will be expected to work until we are 70+, and the average age for moving out to our own places is currently at around 36 (varies in different surveys). All of this despite reasonably high unemployment.
Now this is only a small part of it, you could argue that not enough time has elapsed for things to change, or that the economic situation is to blame, but here's the next problem.
Most futurologists predict that the singularity will take place at around the year 2040. This is the point at which computers become more powerful than the human brain, and with quantum computers only around the corner and examples of "art" made by AI already in existence many of the jobs you listed simply will not be around by 2045 (ish). Computers would take over everything from healthcare and education to garbage disposal and scientific research. They would be capable of out-thinking every human on the planet.
So while I do agree with you to a certain extent.. yes the work load will become more shared hopefully, and perhaps new areas of work will become available the fact is that running a jobs based economy long-term will not work, money will begin to lose some of it's value making capitalism in general perhaps not the best choice long term.
Already there are robots in japan assisting with healthcare, in the UK and many other countries doing surgery, and in the US and other places there are warehouses with no pickers and only minimal staff to keep the robots in check.
So I take your point, and perhaps it'll be a lot longer than my guess of around 2045, but sooner or later humans will serve no big purpose on the planet unless we integrate with AI's, and that's a whole other discussion. :)
It's certainly stimulating to think about it all though.
-Apologies for the wall of text, but I really do enjoy talking about this kind of stuff, and please don't take it as me throwing your suggestions out of the window, I'm very open to hearing your thoughts.

Some types of socialism yes, but voluntaryism for example is an interesting mish-mash of socialism and libertarianism. More libertarian than socialist but still.
Market-Socialism is also reasonably compatible. Personally I believe that either of these two ideologies are far preferable to what the world uses now which is in my opinion at least just an incredibly corrupt version of capitalism.
My view is that voluntaryism is the most likely outcome if Bitcoin does take a big hold, but that by the time we reach around 2040 money as we know it will change dramatically as there are fewer and fewer jobs available due to advances in computing and robotics. It is at this point where the world will be forced into a more socialist ideology since 80% (random number) of the population would be unemployed and reliant on those who were employed.
That's my view, and that's honestly what I hope does happen.

Starcraft is huge, it is the most popular RTS game ever made and the eSports industry it helped found back in the late 90's/early 2000's is now worth over 1 billion $ per year.
eSports stands for electronic sports, it's professional gaming. Like other sports individual players or entire teams are sponsored and attend tournaments and leagues to compete against each other for prize money (again given by sponsors).
The Industry has been quietly growing for the last 15 years and is accelerating at a vast rate. 5 years ago you'd struggle to find any prize money for tournaments worth more than $10,000, but this weekend there is a DOTA2 tournament with over $3,000,000 in prize money, and that's just 1 single event.
Big tournaments are normally streamed and can attracts well over 100,000 concurrent live viewers. Over a weekend some events can reach more than 3 million views on their streams.
Sorry for rambling, but Bitcoin and eSports are my two big obsessions in life, and they compliment each other very well.

perhaps, but then we will get a correction some time soon, I'm not the only person who thinks that there will be 1. Yes, the growth is accelerating, but not that much.. 265 was far too high, 190-220 would be reasonable.

This is a tech savvy gamer who likes technology, yet seems not to understand what is making people speculate on bitcoin in the first place. 
They aren't doing it for fun, the reason people like the winkevoss, brandson and others are invested in bitcoin is because they can see that even if it doesnt become a currency the transaction ledger has huge potential for many things that don't even involve money potentially. For example records of wills, voting systems or patents.
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:20:54
they don't do that for all games, in fact sometimes the europeans and british get better deals.

This is super cool, it's smaller innovations like this which can help get bitcoins more mainstream. My question is why has nobody done this for normal snack vending machines yet?

The other side had Max Keiser on it. I was actually at this march and held that sign for a while, I understood fully that it would probably not go down to well here, the guy who made it was a total stranger, and I think he got more press attention than anyone else there (excluding russell brand.) He got interviewed by a lot of journalists.
Regardless of what you think about it being associated with anonymous, I can tell you that without doubt there was a lot of interest by the public, the protesters and even one police officer.
Here is the other side of the banner:

One could argue that true socialism in fact totally abolishes the concept of money entirely and everything is shared.And i disagree about needing to understand libertarianism to understand decentralization. I understood it just fine by comparing it to bit torrent.Bitcoin whilst allied most heavily to libertarianism can also work ok in other systems, and so promoting only libertarian and anarcho capitalism seems biased and an abuse of power by the mods to me.Lots of people I'm sure, myself included have found out more about these ideologies and maybe even conveyed, but that doesn't make it right to advertise them so heavily Imo.

Quite the assumption you have there.

I wish they weren't coming out tbh, that equipment will make it so that average users are unable to earn any money mining. For example me, I am a PC gamer, I have an ok graphics card and get 125 mhash. I mine between gaming when browsing the web or watching a film. When that equipment comes out the difficulty will jump so high that it becomes inefficient to mine for average users and even people with "high-end gaming PC's".
The rich will get richer, the poor poorer.
Bitcoins need to be distributed more evenly, it's bad enough that the headstart people got on difficulty at the start was so strong that we see people with thousands of coins. They alone can influence the market dramatically. Which is bad for bitcoin.
Just my opinion.
As for BetsofBitcoins - I think the call they made was wrong but people flaming the website as being a scam is also wrong. They earn nothing by declaring it a draw and refunding everyone their bets. Sure it could have been judged better, but this could have been much worse.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:39:01
I plan on doing this as soon as 2 bitcoins can get me back my original investment, so probably some point next year for me.. even then I'd be tempted not to, the higher it goes the more I think "well clearly it's not going to crash and burn to nothing from here.." xD
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:30:12
Please do not take this as an insult at all, but I'm currently in the process of setting up my item to sell and I actually found it a little more difficult. It seems like the system was more designed for setting up a normal shop than for selling things in an auction style. It has no "bid or buyout" price options, only 1 price and a "sale" price which I guess is similar to what shops do with their winter sales or whatever.
Again, there is nowhere to list a shipping price it seems.
Perhaps I am just blind.
Aside from those small issues the website is very fast and responsive and looks a lot nicer and more modern than bitmit. Hopefully I can figure this out and list my item. :)

Maybe they went and googled it after the argument, taped the waller back together, watched it rise in value and realised how dumb they were. Sure they can decline the tip, give it back or whatever.. But to ban you was a duck move.Glad things worked out, if they accept bitcoin it'll all have been worth it.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:21:04
yeah but you can't expect people to hold it until they have more places to spend it, their suppliers need to accept it, and their employees. It takes time to build up, and until then there's nothing wrong with simply swapping it for other currencies via bitpay and such imo.

He's entitled to his opinion, and he has some very good points, this could well be the begining of the end for some governments and the main banking system. However it's extremely unlikely and it is not the agenda of Bitcoin to do that.
Most bitcoin users (I think) are using it both as a safe store of value and as an easy way for buying goods online and occasionally in person. 
I for 1 am not against paying capital gains tax or trying to avoid the normal taxes with my bitcoins, I have them because it's fast, convenient and safer than using most other services. Oh, and it's extremely fun to be part of this community and watch the up's and downs.

My friend is in litecoins and said that there are a few big names trading on BTC-E who everyone is following who are doing coordinated pump/dumps, it's a shame especially for some of the more innovative coins, but this is what happens when a currency has few low market cap.

I think his words are too strong there, internet access can really help change Africa for the better, it provides potential for self-education to millions of people for very low cost in a continent where a huge chunk of society doesn't even get the opportunity to attend a school.
Researching malaria is all good, but it only fixes 1 problem. Giving internet access and financial access to people empowers them to help themselves.
I'm not saying malaria research is a bad thing, but to call giving internet access a "joke" is also kinda silly.

I disagree, you could argue that electricity &gt; computers yet without computers we couldn't have found potential cures for hundreds of thousands of health problems, or have sent people into space.
It could be argued that the internet has had a much bigger effect on society than electricity did for example. Because the internet has allowed communication across the planet at near instant speeds as well as huge increases in the learning ability of people around the world. Yet electricity at the time it was introduced provided little more than light or heat.
This all being said, it's like comparing apples and oranges, every major leap in technology has been hugely important, and Crypto-currencies will probably be considered as one of these major leaps.

Co-Founder of BinaryBeast here (biggest gaming tournament platform), we too have plans for Bitcoin, I think it has the potential to be really big in eSports for many reasons.
1. Sending prize money around the world to players from all different countries is time consuming, expensive and difficult
2. Some countries have laws not allowing "real money" to be given as prizes since they see it as a form of gambling.. Portugal is a big example for this, their biggest gaming event XLParty is forced to give our products or coupons as prizes, not cash.
3. Bitcoins makes prize money a lot easier to understand for people in different countries. Where as before in europe prize money is labeled in Euros, the UK GBP, the USA USD and such listing prizes in bitcoins makes it instantly easier to compare prize funds for different events and know how big the prize pool is.
4. The audience is already generally pretty interested in technology and so are likely to have less problems learning how to use bitcoins.
5. eSports has had a long history of people promising prizes and not giving them out, with bitcoins we can easily verify that the organizer has the number of bitcoins in their wallet removing some of the risk.
I wish I could disclose more about what we intend on using Bitcoins for in our website but it's all top secret, we are working with another company who recently got into bitcoins who I think most people on this reddit will be aware of as well. I suspect it could really change the world of online tournaments and actively encourage more cash prize events to take place if enough people begin to learn how it works.

Lmao, good point. The only things potentially worth selling for are precious metals?
By the time BTC value hits 10-20k per coin the world will have cottened on to the fact that BTC is here to stay and it will probably be widely used as a main currency for millions of people. So why even sell?
Eventually mt gox will have to change the value from USD into Gold or Silver and we'll all still be here talking about how BTC just hit 5 bars of silver or whatever.

At least we still have BitBargain.co.uk - I swear I'm the only guy who hasn't ever used a main exchange.
BitBargain is just so fast and easy, Takes less than 5 minutes to get my coins and 0 fees.
This is indeed a big shame though. I've not tested to see if my bank is doing it. I'm with Nationwide building society, their online banking has been offline for almost 24 hours now though.
Also can anyone tell me if there is anything illegal about simply using a bank transfer to buy BTC? I'm kind of paranoid thinking that the bank knows what I'm doing. Certainly if I buy/sell often they will probably wonder what I'm doing?

Eh, I have several thousand usd worth sitting in a bitcoin-qt wallet with a standard encrypted password, have two backups, 1 on my external and 1 on mega (which i only use for this..) I've had no issues so far, its been 3 months, but i do get really paranoid. It seems to me that the likelyhood of losing them with this level of security is the same as getting a terrible virus that cripples your PC. As long as you visit reputable websites only you should be fine.I'd take more precautions, but it seems most people here just assume that everyone has super-human computer skills.
