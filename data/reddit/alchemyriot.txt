It's when I try to buy. As soon as I click that, it brings me to the verify your identity page and so I try to and it flashes please wait... For literally a second and then that disappears. It just keeps telling me failed to verify whenever I upload anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:55:09
Now it's telling me that I have exceeded the number of attempts to verify and to try again in 24 hours..... For the love of god.....

I know absolutely nothing pertaining to this segwit2x thingamadoodle... but should I want to get in on it, would HitBTC be a good starting point?

It's asking me to identify myself..... I've uploaded a photo of my driver's license... A military ID along with the selfie and it's telling me it's unable to verify. Stahp.
