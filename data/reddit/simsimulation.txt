Just an FYI - merchant services is a huge industry with tons of sales people. This means business owners get calls and solicitations non-stop. 
Unless the owner is already aware and positive on bitcoin, you’re going to run up on hard objections. 
In addition, getting to the owner can often be difficult as well. With that said, you might see a decent percent of owners who are aware and want to save the CC fee.
Killing merchant service is one of the huge upsides for bitcoin. If you can crack it and speed adoption, more power to you.

The US has political and economic interests in the Middle East. So does Russia. Don’t act like one side is the good guy.

Yes and no. There’s a higher requirement to maintain cash balances at banks now than 10 years ago. 
The last big repo week that made the news was a combination of factors hitting on one day. One being the quarterly business taxes being due, so bank balances got low. 
I’m not exactly sure of my point except for stating facts. One point to make, though,  is that this environment makes it more difficult for banks to make a profit: low interest rates plus high demand for liquidity (~10% now vs 1% last decade). I’m anti-bank, so this is a good thing IMO. 
I’m not an economist, a banker or a fed chairman, so it’s above my knowledge to speculate on outcomes, but I did want to point out to Reddit that the repo market is temporary liquidity and counter-intuitively is money destroying in nature.
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:17:25
Gonna be unpopular here saying this, but the overnight repo market is not the same as money creation. Because the repo market provides temporary liquidity (overnight / 24 hours) and is paid back to the Fed with interest it is actually money destroying in nature. 
While runs on the repo market happened before the 2008 crash, a number of factors are different now including higher requirements for liquidity, necessitating a repo loan to cover short falls.

I don’t think that is true. First, the 21 million part is still arbitrary. If it were maximum, it would be 99 million. Second, having 8 decimal points is also arbitrary. It could be 7. Or 10. 
Finally, there are established max int and float values based on available information in a bit, this is true. A long value can be up to 19 places (not 16), same with long double.

Look, inflation is real and is certainly a tax on the poor and those with no wage growth opportunity.But, this picture is really just fucking bad:
1) Different time scales  
2) No numbers of purchasing power, just pictures. What the fuck is in the cart? I was alive in 1998, and $20 did not buy a whole cart of groceries. There's at least 2 bottles of alcohol in there.   
3) Shopping carts have not changed as much as this 'disinformation graphic' would have you assume
Granted, between prices in 1998 and 2014 are 45% higher (source: [ but that last cart makes it look more like 90%.

Meh. That's not really how it works, though. The point of a business is to generate profits. The profits are drawn out of the business and distributed to owners. The wealth is held outside of the business and is taxed upon withdraw.
Loans are used accelerate growth or smooth cash flow. Sure, if you're bleeding money and need a loan to cover your loses, you're going to lose more, but for most businesses there's a "cost of capital" calculation - basically, you know how much profit you make on each dollar spent, if you make more money than the cost of interest, there's very little reason to not uses OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY to growth faster, assuming the interest on that loan is negligible to profit gained.
Assume an inventory business that sells $1000 of product per month. Say Cost of Goods sold is $100 per month. Profit margin is 30% (overhead, labor and other expenses accounting for the additional 60%).
Each month, $300 profit is made and is drawn out of the business as distribution. If the business is to replace the inventory sold, that's part of the margin. But what if next month you think you'll need $120 of inventory? You could either draw $280 from the business, or you could draw $300 and finance the $20.
Let's say you finance all of your inventory. You can get a loan for $100 and pay 6% interest, or .50 for the month. That .50 of cost essentially generates $300 in profit.
Everyone knows that a loan is money that needs to be paid back (except for script writers and journalists, apparently), but how the real world works is "cost of capital" and how much profit can be generated on a capital investment.
Usury is not a particularly new idea and there's a reason it's stuck around for so long. There's just other stuff you can do with money, having more of it around has a value, and if you're able to derive more value from the money than a bank is charging you to rent money, then why wouldn't you do that?
Perhaps your friend didn't get a business degree?
@_date: 2019-09-24 05:22:28
Well, if the banks pay higher rates, they’re going to charge you higher rates.
