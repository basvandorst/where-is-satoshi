I agree that a national currency based on BTC is unrealistic. However, if the country were to back Bitcoin and be more open to trade, surely that would be beneficial for the people of Scotland?

"...designed as a weapon."
Only someone expecting an attack would view Bitcoin as this.
Of course governments and banks are expecting attack, because for years they have been fucking everyone over!

True. Perhaps avoiding the Yes Campaign is sensible and this idea being suggested by a third party group could work? I want this to happen!!!
