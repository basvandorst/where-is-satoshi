Thanks for the reply.
I'm hoping that some day we have a "closed bitcoin circle" i.e. I get payed in bitcoin, I buy with bitcoin, merchants keep their money in bitcoin and pay their expenses in bitcoin, I have savings account, pay for child care, have a retirement fund... all that in Bitcoin without having to convert to any other currency. I think only then would bitcoin really shine and show it's true potential. 
BTW thanks for pointing out btctransit. I promise I'll have a good look at it.

To my surprise, I can now confirm that you are actually right for the BTC-&gt;fiat cost added by the merchant, there is none. Flight bought from cheapair.com in USD costs 588 and if I buy bitcoin from coinbase(which they seam to be using) and pay with it would cost me 585.
Once I find a way to buy bitcoin and not have to pay a min. of 15$, I would be happy.

Appreciate your reply. 
But would you pay for the "charter jet"? I sure would not. 
The main reason why I decided to post this set of questions/opinions was because by watching youtube videos and reading blog/forum posts were very misleading for me up to the point where I started thinking "hey I have to be missing something here". 
Many people are promoting bitcoin as a way to do money transfers much cheaper than you otherwise would. If you think about it, it is true but in the same time so far from reality. If you own bitcoin you can transfer to any bitcoin address for free regardless of the amount. It is like advertising a car that can take you 300 miles for free and not mention that your gas tank needs to be full.

I feel the same way about "banksters" :) and I probably have better reasons for that than you.
I'm sure not an economy expert but I can remember that I could buy 1l milk for 7MKD and now the cheapest imported I can find is 47MKD. This would only make sense to me if salaries were higher 6-7 times higher but guess what :) they are not. My mother has the same salary for the last 25 years. There are so many ways I could be wrong with this post but at least as I understand currencies, printing more money can do exactly this.

I very well understand and agree on what you are saying. As bot my post and your analogy imply: currently for the average user, bitcoin is not really acceptable as a payment method due to it's constraints to fiat currencies. This will most likely change but time needs to pass.
