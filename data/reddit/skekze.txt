The exchange rate of schrute bucks to stanley nickels is the same as unicorns to leprechauns, but bitcoins are no different than money in that whoever controls it, can change the rules and make your dollar, bitcoin or wooden nickel worth a pug's fart in a day.

and now there's over a thousand.  Which one wins?

Gold is on the stock exchange.  Easily sold almost anywhere on earth.  It's authentification built in.  Virtual currencies have the same problems fiat currencies do, limited range in numbers partcipating even if crossing international borders.

Ok then, but when these governments crush most of them underfoot as a means to launder money and scam people, don't be surprised.  How many robberies of cryptocurrencies have there been?  A few I believe, so tell me again how secure it all is.  The banks are dabbling with it, but it might be useful to track supply chains, but I doubt you'll have a universal currency anytime soon.  How many bitcoins users can there be?  Not a big trading pool.  22 million in a world of seven billion isn't that much a threat to the dollar.

Bitcoin might contain the tech that gives birth to universal money, but I doubt very much it will survive.   Wealth inequality is the very reason people want a decentralized money supply so it can't be artificially inflated, but isn't that bitcoin's rise?  It's relying on a steady supply of new customers to lift the price, so it's as man made a commodity as the stock market or the over valuation of internet websites.  Tangible assets ultimately take precedence over virtual ones.

Then control of the money supply goes to the luckiest who invested first.  Just a flip flop of some upside down pyramid where instead of oligarchs it becomes a technocracy.  
The concept of bitcoin is a good idea, but I don't think it invalidates the fact that money's worth in exchange for goods depends on the assurance that money can be accepted most elsewhere.  Gold has that assurance whereas bitcoin doesn't.

You still have corrupt governments who favor nepotism and delusion, you're nowhere near the transparency required to create a world wide currency that would be accepted.  You can buy gold ETFs right now.  The tax man wants his change and there's no way you'll be hiding long from him unless you're the yacht class and even these days they're gonna pay the ferryman before he gets you to the other side.

This shit is out of hand.  What I see is distrust in all nation's currencies.  Good times.

or the last great depression or how her father's business was confiscated, eerie how art imitates life or maybe history just repeats.

Rename this shit to Credits and I'll believe you.
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:55:04
Not my cup of tea.  Every bit of scifi I've seen calls it Credits.  I'll wait til the dust settles.  
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:45:03
into slavery cause the economy will have collapsed.  Rename this Credits and I'll timeshare the pug and buy in.  Gold guy's telling me the same thing and these forengis keep pestering me to pick up some gold-pressed latinum.

Gold will leave the stage when people don't steal, so never in my lifetime.  I watched gold for a decade and you'll never see it go below a thousand.  It's a bargain at $1200/oz.  Yet only archive the money you don't want to invest, because it's a piggy bank, it doesn't grow the value, it keeps the value stored when you bought the gold, minus the fees of buying and selling.

Because I want to live in an age of prosperity not disparity.

Gold is on the stock exchange, bitcoin isn't.

Gold is on the stock market.  Bitcoin has a way to go before it replaces what can be easily authenticated.

Orbit the asteroid around the moon and mine at leisure with drones who deposit ore to be automatically processed into refined metals in an automated manufacturing facility on the moon's surface.  Then load into shipping containers by drones and launched at a vector to earth to crash into the sea at predetermined points.  Why send a human at all when we can have AI run the whole thing.

Bitcoin 1.0 - I'll wait for Credits.  Every game I ever played used Credits.  So, like 4-20 versions from now.

Mmmm, Virgin Cola my fav.  He's right about some things, just ain't this one.
