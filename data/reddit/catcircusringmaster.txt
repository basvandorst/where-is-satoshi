asicboost and segwit aren't compatible. bcash will never have Segwit.

That's a shame. If it's moving with the Nano, then the Nano is likely the problem. Hopefully Ledger has a good warranty, if you hear back from them it would be great if you could post an update. Others, myself included, are likely interested to hear what Ledger's warranty is.

Loans, financing, multi-party agreements, etc., will potentially be sorted out using smart contracts. These contracts are essentially code written to trigger a series of events when a given event on a blockchain occurs. And because it's all machine to machine it can all be automated. A loan is an easy piece of software that transfers some amount of cryptocurrecy to you, and it's recorded on a blockchain, and over a period of time the transactions go the other way, likely with a small % interest. I believe there are these types of loan services for various cryptocurrencies already available (e.g.  The future is now.

What's this in reference to?

I think you would want multiple nodes for backup and validation; but otherwise, yeah, I think Bitcoin would continue to operate.

But the argument is the miner's actions, keeping them honest, should always be motivated by maintaining value in the blockchain, if the theory is working as intended. I suppose different miners have different perspectives on how that value is maintained. It will be interesting in any case. Personally, I'm still not convinced the S2X actions are beneficial, and maintain value in the blockchain, but to each their own.
Appreciate the discourse, you've motivated me to more thoroughly consider different mining groups goal of value. Thanks.

I wish I had your internet connection. 10Mb $45/m, and I'm in a 1st world country :(. And my upstream is a small fraction of that. I do run a node on AWS though. It's not ideal, but I want to support crypto. If I had the internet capacity I would run a node at home. 2MB blocks would quickly be impossible for me. 
It currently takes over a day for a small-sized node to rebuild the blockchain on AWS. It's interesting that from my perspective, with a small net connection, we already have a slowly growing problem that needs to be solved, and that's only with a 1MB block size.

But now your conflating consensus between nodes that PoW is valid, and that the same consensus, from hash power, should be what allows modifications to the code base to occur. I don't see them as the same. Consensus for changes to the code base to me means all parties in the bitcoin stack: miners, nodes, exchanges, coders, users, all agree. They all agree and run what code is considered valid. No nodes are running S2X. No coders are pushing S2X. Users aren't being listened to. So I don't see consensus.
It seems your perspective keeps pushing that hash power defines the direction of the blockchain. I disagree, or don't want to be part of that blockchain. And that's fine, we don't all need to keep money in btc. If hash power dictates code development then it seems easy for big $ to dictate direction. They get to dictate when new features or upgrades are released or merged. No thanks. There's a lot bigger power and money in the world than the NYA group. Based on your perspective I think any group of power can dictate the future direction of bitcoin, and to me that not a secure place to keep money.

Very cool. I was just looking at some old PC hardware I have around to re-purpose for running a node. This would be more energy efficient.

It's my understanding from the Nakamoto Concensus that the miner's financial investment to provide PoW is what keeps them from damaging the blockchain and thus allowing it to lose value; their goal is to keep it valuable because they're invested. I think the signing the NYA without consensus in the bitcoin community is damaging to the value of the blockchain. Perhaps not their intent, but I don't see a community in agreement. I suppose my trust with them was broken when that occurred. It was my hope that a means of allowing the users, that create the demand for PoW, would be able to influence which direction the decision would go, but I don't think that's likely.
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:53:32
The miner's decision certainly does limit options, we agree there. And you're right, that it's difficult for them to not fulfill their signed agreement. But many argue that agreement was made without consensus from the majority of the bitcoin stack. The parties in the NYA are hash power and big $, I don't see that as a consensus. They are already being dishonest by claiming consensus with the NYA.

Litecoin is an option to cheaply send money. I can see a future where LTC and BTC are fluidly swapped for transactions and long-term storage. It's already fairly easy, but not seamless for an everyday user yet.

I fail to see how miners are nodes, they appear to serve different roles. Please clarify.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:18:56


You pose a very good perspective, but I don't think the above statement is accurate. Hash power should not equate to dictating the direction of a good cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a stack of many different components, miners and hash power being one of them.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:47:05
Those are good perspectives to consider. But I think your last sentence overly plays down the 'risks/strains' vs 'inaction'. 
The blockchain is somewhere around 140 gig (I think). ~~Doubling that~~ Having the rate of growth double is going to be a significant challenge for individual nodes. That kind of centralization is exactly what we don't want in a crytocurrency. That's a high risk.
And the implementation of Segwit is far from inaction. I frees up block space. I believe it's at around 7% deployed. It there was more cooperation the rate of deployment would likely be faster.
Like you, I don't support 2x in November. I think if we wait a while longer to let Segwit fully deploy, a more informed decision about a hardfork can be made.

The above commit allows for S2X nodes to not advertise as a S2X node. To go incognito. Doing so is going to cause a mess between nodes. Eventually, the S2X nodes should be banned from the BTC nodes. But adding this code to their repo makes it clear what their intentions are. One of the groups I referenced was the Nodes. I run a node. There are next to no S2X nodes, because there isn't consensus among the groups. S2X needs to use actions the the code I linked to in order to succeed. So, like I said, if only a subsection of the groups is able to accomplish a change of this scale then I think the bitcoin blockchain is not strong enough to hold in the future. If that's the case I'm out.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:47:23
No, because the core nodes existed before 2x was even thought of. And if 2x was reasonable with replay-protection again we wouldn't have a node problem. Only because 2x is trying harm the network do we have a problem.

Yup. If mining &amp; big business can highjack a blockchain like bitcoin then I don't want it.

You can make a pull request to the repo, but you can't make changes to the codebase. I encourage you to try. Commit a comment of 'is a genius'. I'll pay you a btc1 coin when that gets merged in. 
And yes, hash power, and the ~10 people that run most of it. And somehow those ~10 people comprise 95% of consensus.
I'm well aware no one is threatening my financial sovereignty. I'm disappointed that there's a good chance bitcoin's blockchain will be broken in a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:39:58
What about a white/black list for nodes? We could start one if there isn't one already.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:54:22
Right, thanks for clarifying. The rate of growth doubles immediately, but the history remains the same size.

I'm not sure which type of users you're referring to. I'd argue there are many different types of users in the bitcoin stack: Coders; Miners; Nodes; Exchanges; HODLers; Market/commodity traders; actually everyday users, etc. 
For S2X and the NYA we have a chunk of miners, exchanges - general big $ - that want to influence blockchain code changes. So a subset of the above user groups is demonstrating that they can modify the code that runs the blockchain (e.g. making commits like this:  That is very counter to what I believe to be a very important element of a good cryptocurrency; that it's not run by any single party or group. 
So, if this code change is successfully demonstrated, by hiding in nodes or whatever they want to try, then the resiliency of the bitcoin blockchain has failed. If it's that easy to influence what's to stop future players even bigger than this group from taking over the blockchain themselves? Why would I want to store my money in that system?

Operating on the same PC doesn't mean they occupy the same role. That's like saying an sql db and webserver deployed on the same PC occupy the same role. They don't.
