Hi, we have received your email. It will take a about 2 weeks for the equipment to arrive in Mongolia and go through customs, starting from the time of your purchase. 
As for the returns you can expect, that is extremely variable depending on the mining difficulty and Bitcoin price. We will send you an email with a projection model, but please realize that it is a projection.

Thanks. A good sense of humor is the only thing that gets us through the winter.

We never said mining was profitable. That is dependent on the projections of our clients and their mindset going into the mining business. Since Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, it could potentially be a very lucrative investment in the long run. 
If electricity is so cheap, why not mine ourselves? By hosting miners, we can make a steady profit that isn't dependent on the market volatility of Bitcoins. Furthermore, the capital expenditure required for establishing a mining facility is peanuts compared to the investment required to purchase the mining machines. 
As crazy as it sounds, Bitcoin miners in Mongolia have the potential of bringing balance to our energy infrastructure and can be helpful in creating demand for renewable energy. But this is a whole different topic on its own. 
Yeah, the crypto space is full of scams. So can't blame you there. I've been replying to "scam" comments a lot, but yours was the one that really got me. I really hated Bitconnect from the first day since I found about its existence. 
We even featured a news article about these kinds of scams in our Mongolian news page back in mid December.

Thanks. I was out of line when posting the reply above and should not have generalized people like that.

After having made the exact same post in a number of subs, i have encountered cynicism on a level i did not expect from reddit. I feel there is a racist undertone to the whole thing because we are operating in Mongolia. It is obviously clear that most white people consider our country to be one of those "shit hole" countries. I guess that is to be expected from people who elected Trump as their president. 
There is a new book out called "Factfulness", i suggest you read it.

Unfortunately thats the only thing most people know about Mongolia. People don't realize we're a pretty modern country and that we are developing rather fast in terms of our economy.

There is at least one blockchain based event every month. But the population of the entire country is only 3 million. So the community is pretty small and at this point everyone knows everyone else. 
Charles Hoskins visited UB last week : )

In a lot of ways, Bitcoin mining is like Bitcoin trading. Each of our clients have their own strategy and mindset. I can safely assume that they intend to HODL for a long time. 
In the end, i agree that there is a lot of speculation behind their decision. Which is why hosting rather than mining is much more stable in terms of revenue. It is our belief that Bitcoin is a safe haven for value, similar to gold. The general consensus is that another recession, worse than the one that happened in 2008 is coming. Either the US will default on its debt, or the USD will experience runaway inflation. 
Also, mining calculator estimations can change drastically depending on Bitcoin price and difficulty, variables which are always changing by the second.

People trying to apply blockchain solutions to situations that do not require it. Also companies changing their name to "Blockchain" something in order to get a momentary boost to their share prices. And its just too darn complicated for old people to understand. These are the only things currently wrong with blockchain.

You should take the leap and visit. Most people find the Mongolian countryside to be surreal. Ofcourse i would have to recommend summer. Winters can be pretty harsh if your not used to the cold.

To be honest with you we've managed to raise quite a good amount to build our facility where our current customers mine but sadly it wasn't enough for us to mine ourselves

That's a great idea! Let us get back to you with it soon.
