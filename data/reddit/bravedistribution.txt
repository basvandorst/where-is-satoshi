If it's insured, then basically you can't lose the money. I think much more probable is that you will be hacked even if you have cold wallet (some kind of malware).

Tell it to those that bought at peak ;).
Completely not objective. Feel free to downvote me, at least I am not completely blind.

Ofc price is just about demand and supply. In case someone creates new asset with hard cap at 2 coins (i.e fb) then the coin can have multiple times higher value.
If you mean market cap, then surely as well. I think both xrp and eth will surpass the btc in cap.
Downvote me for opinion.

I will get a lot of downvotes, but dollar has intristic value in the usa economy and its usage as reserve currency in the whole world.
Cryptocurrency should have value based on the price of energy. But until btc and all other cryptocurrencies will be used everywhere and until they resolve scaling and security and holding issues its value is based only on speculation,

Why not use stocks? You can see it in notification center.

I don't understand what is the top bar :). I added BTC,XRP,ETH sticker into the "Stocks portfolio" and then if I move my mouse into top right corner, notification center with widgets open and there I can see the stock widget.
EDIT: If you mean the top bar as the bar where wifi, bluetooth etc is, then no, it isn't there.
