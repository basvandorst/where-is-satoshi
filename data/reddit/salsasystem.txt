I've been using PPA for a long time, and I've noticed that there is always some delay (a few days, around 1 week) before updating to the core new version

I'm sending more than 1 BTC and getting this error, how can it be considered a dust tx?

Should full nodes switch to XT to support 20MB or only miners at this time?

I'm not against getutxos support, I'm against introducing this patch to benefit a personal project (lighthouse) without community consensus.
Same argument for DDOS protection with ip blacklist, bringing privacy leaks...there's no consensus about this patch

Sure, but for storing the hash of the doc a tx must be sent and a fee must be paid...
@_date: 2017-04-12 16:19:03
Who pays the tx fees for storing the docs on the blockchain?

[Multichain]( is also an opensource private blockchain...what's the difference between Openchain and Multichain? Any benefit to use one over the other?

NO need for merging...You need to set the bitcoin data directory in your 150GB mounted drive...see points 3 and 4 in my previous comment for how to dot it:
    `mkdir /mnt/data/.bitcoin`
Set the following line in your bitcoin config file of your main 50GB drive:
    `datadir=/mnt/data/.bitcoin/`

Only accessible from command line ssh, no GUI, this is a remote server.
1. Install Bitcoin Core:
    `sudo apt-get install software-properties-common`  
    `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin`  
    `sudo apt-get update`  
    `sudo apt-get install bitcoind`  
2. Run Bitcoin Core so that it starts up,  but immediately close it once it starts trying to sync the blockchain. We do this so that it creates your Bitcoin data directory:
    `bitcoind`    
    `bitcoin-cli stop`    
3. Create a new bitcoin data folder in the mounted disk (blockchain is around 80GB, so you need to move it to mounted disk):
    `mkdir /mnt/data/.bitcoin`
4. Edit bitcoin config file and point to the data folder created in mounted disk adding the line below in config file:
    `datadir=/mnt/data/.bitcoin/`
5. Run Bitcoin  Core full node:
    `bitcoind`
