Here's something else worth reading:
[An Examination of Single-Transaction Blocks and Their Effect on Network Throughput and Block Size](
Turns out that Bitcoin already has  a mechanism for "voting" on block sizes. If a miner produces a block that takes a long time for other miners to verify, odds are good that one of those other miners will manage to produce an empty block during the delay and orphan the large block. So anyone who's sending out blocks significantly larger than the bulk of the network can handle will get orphaned a lot and will have to dial back the size of their blocks accordingly.
Neat how it just falls out of the inherent dynamics of the network that way, no need for any fancy algorithms.
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:41:52
There may be a misunderstanding because I think you just described option  When I say "block size limit" I'm referring only to the hard-coded limit that's built into the protocol itself, not the underlying technology's physical capacity.
Obviously Bitcoin's capacity is strictly limited to what the underlying technology can handle. If the wires themselves can only put a million transactions through then it doesn't matter if the *protocol* says the limit is higher, you're only getting a million transactions. In that scenario there's effectively no *protocol* limit because we can never actually reach it (at least not with current technology limits - technology improves over time so it may yet come into play someday, which is why some people consider BIP101's ultimate 8GB cap to still be conservative).

I've been saying something like this for a while now with regards to the notion that an altcoin such as Litecoin could step in to handle the "micropayments" while Bitcoin remained as some sort of static value store that isn't used for anything. It really wouldn't work IMO. If Litecoin is generally useful for paying for small stuff, there's no fundamental reason why it can't be used in larger amounts to pay for larger stuff. If Litecoin steps in to Bitcoin's role Bitcoin doesn't really *have* a role any more, and therefore wouldn't really have value.

As I understand it the recently-released "Bitcoin Unlimited" has functionality that would allow miners to set their mining rigs to avoid extending a chain that has a block larger than their preferred maximum. BU will continue working on the chain that stays within its preferred limit unless someone else extends the bigger-blocked chain far enough for it to go "well I guess everyone else is on board with blocks this big then," at which point it will switch over to the majority chain.
That should automate the "constant vigilance" part and make it practical. Any miner that tried mining blocks bigger than what the majority of the other mining power out there wanted to accept would find themselves frequently orphaned and would have to dial back their block size or start losing money. If someone didn't care about money and put out a block that was bigger than *anyone* wanted it would be guaranteed to be immediately orphaned, making it harmless.
This looks like it just formalizes the process outlined in Stone's paper, in which miners can already "veto" an overly-large block by mining an empty block while the big block is stuck being validated.

It depends on which language you're using. In some of them null == 0.
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:23:05
I've been rather impressed by [this recent paper by Andrew Stone]( that indicates that even if there was no explicit mechanism for setting a "maximum" block size there's still a natural feedback mechanism in the Bitcoin protocol that would ensure blocks remained small enough for most miners to handle. Namely, if a miner produces a big block that takes a long time for other miners to verify, there's a window during that verification time where other miners could produce an empty block and thus orphan the long-time-taking block. So any miner that habitually produces blocks that take an inordinately long time for the other miners to verify will find themselves being orphaned a lot and lose money.

So it is claimed. I've seen analyses that also say the opposite, though, suggesting that multi-hop routing isn't going to generalize very well. I don't think it's a good idea gambling on a completely unproven technology as the only way to do something Bitcoin can already do.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:27:49
There is no compromise position. For all the numbers and BIPs and whatnot that get thrown around, there's really only two fundamental positions here:
1. The block size limit should be somewhere below the actual level of demand for transactional capacity, forcing blocks to stay "full" and forcing some transactions to eventually fall out of the backlog.
2. The block size limit should stay somewhere above the actual level of demand, allowing all transactions room to get into the block chain if a miner chooses to include them.
The key to the dispute is what the block limit is meant to be *for*, the purpose that it serves. Supporters of position 1 generally see it as a means of influencing the market in some way, supporters of position 2 see it as a technical safety measure that's meant to protect against outrageously large blocks sent to the blockchain through malice or error.
A one-time increase to 2MB - or any "fixed" block size limit, really - falls firmly into position  and will not satisfy adherents to position

Segregated Witness also results in a larger block size. The extra data is technically not part of the block, but it is still needed in order to properly verify the transactions contained within the block. So the bandwidth usage goes up just the same as if the block size itself got larger by that amount.

The thing that I like about Lightning is the things it will enable that Bitcoin can't currently do, not the idea that it will *replace* what Bitcoin can currently do. Bitcoin wouldn't work very well for the micropayments used by a P2P filesharing network that let people buy and sell data transfer by the kilobyte, for example, or a web archive that charges a half penny per page you view, but both of those cases could be handled by setting up a Lightning channel when you sign in and closing it when you sign out. Whereas the proverbial cup of coffee is a one-time payment of a substantial amount, which seems more like Bitcoin's cup of tea.

Mods are able to set a "suggested" style of comment sorting on a thread-by-thread basis. Lately certain threads here in have been set with a suggested "controversial comments first" sort order by the mods, and many people suspect that they're picking and choosing which threads to sort that way to ensure that the mod-preferred comments wind up at the top of the comment list even if they're heavily downvoted by the community. I recommend going into your Reddit preferences and enabling the "ignore suggested sorts" option.
In general this subreddit has been suffering a lot of censorship in recent months. There are certain Bitcoin developments and protocol proposals that the mods are opposed to and so they've banned discussion of them. Even mentioning them can get a person banned. has wound up becoming the fallback subreddit of choice for most discussion of these proposals and other matters related to them.
Get ready for a lot of sound and fury as you investigate this further, it's kind of a big deal right now and tempers are very heated on all sides.

Well, there's a DDoS campaign that's been hitting mining pools whenever they announce they're making those new implementations available. Putting a stop to that would be helpful.
A better approach would be to have the major Bitcoin exchanges and payment processors endorse the new implementations. The biggest one's already done so but it got banned from this subreddit as a result. Maybe we should not do stuff like that, that would help too.
And most importantly, the Core devs could endorse one of them. That'd probably break the logjam right then and there.

Network effect cuts both ways, though. If there's lots more people using Litecoin than there ares using Bitcoin I think we'll see their roles reverse as well - there'll be lots of Litecoin-payment-only businesses and big Litecoin-specific mining operations will crop up (making it as secure as Bitcoin is now). A currency's value comes from its utility and in this scenario I don't see what utility advantage Bitcoin would have over Litecoin.
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:53:27
Fortunately there's already a safety mechanism against this sort of thing. If a block is mined that takes ten minutes for other miners to verify, then during the time while all the other miners are trying to verify that block their ASICs will still be chugging away trying to find an empty block (because otherwise they'd just be sitting idle).
If the other miners find an empty block during that ten-minute verification period it'll get broadcast and verified by the other miners very quickly, and everyone will start trying to build the next block on that one instead - likely resulting in the big, slow block being orphaned.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:55:53
The protocol defines a size limit to how big a block of transactions can be, originally intended as a safety measure to prevent an unusually large block from being added and potentially causing trouble processing it. The usage of Bitcoin has grown over time so that now all blocks are bumping up against that old limit, preventing further growth.
Various proposals have been made to increase Bitcoin's capacity in various ways. However, some of those proposals are prohibited from being discussed here on so you may wish to find alternative fora to ask for further details about them. Suffice to say each side think the other sides are going to "destroy Bitcoin" and so trenches have been dug.
@_date: 2015-12-30 10:15:15
Yes, it would be nice if more miners adopted those implementations. A pity that there's been heavy pressure on them not to do that and discussion of those implementations have been forbidden in many major Bitcoin fora.

Trivial to circumvent by disabling subreddit styling, though. So it wouldn't be a very pure experiment.

Don't have one handy, I'm afraid. Been a lot of threads over the past few days, I can't recall which one I saw it in specifically. But IMO the burden is on the Lightning people to prove their claims, both that Lightning will work for general payment processing and that Bitcoin will *stop* working for it. I don't see a reason to assume either one of those is true.
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:24:36
You don't even need to make a prediction, just do "while new block is not yet verified, mine on previous block header." Basic probability then kicks in - quick-to-verify blocks are *unlikely* to be orphaned, but long-verifying ones are *likely* to be orphaned.
There's no need for any fancy fudge factors or inter-miner voting or anything, with this. As technology advances and it becomes quicker to distribute and verify larger blocks, larger blocks naturally get a better chance to make it into the chain unorphaned. If there's a backlog of transactions, boosting the transaction fee you've added to your transaction will give an incentive for miners to take a chance on including it. This would be a *real* "fee market", because cranking up the price you pay for transaction space will actually result in miners *providing* more space. They'll balance the risk of issuing larger blocks versus the reward of the transaction fee. Different miners can weight the risks differently and the ones who do best at finding the balance will make the most profit.
Man, until I came across the paper describing this I was not super enamored of any particular solution to the block size problem. I knew it needed to be raised, but all the solutions felt either arbitrary or overly complicated attempts to make up a way to balance things by "force". But this feels really natural. I'm loving it.
@_date: 2015-12-29 06:45:45
A lot of people are skeptical that things like segregated witness or lightning will work as advertised or will be available on time, though. They're all new and untested (unwritten, even). Whereas increasing the block size limit has implementations that are already written, tested, and rolled out for production use.

"Investors" aren't just HODLers, though. They're people who've spent money on miners, ATMs, point of sale equipment, exchange infrastructure, payment processing infrastructure, or who just plain use Bitcoin for their business. All of those people could switch to a whole new blockchain without losing anything since all they care about is the day-to-day operation. And if the new blockchain is forked off of Bitcoin's current one even the HODLers get to keep their stashes.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:26:51
The experiment is currently being done *by Bitcoin*, not by the altcoins. I'm pretty sure we've never had a cryptocurrency run into a self-imposed transaction limit like Bitcoin is doing now. The other coins are still behaving "normally," Bitcoin is the one that has changed its behaviour.
If the userbase as a whole switches from Bitcoin to Litecoin, then we'll have learned the result of that new behaviour - it kills the coin that does it. So it'd behoove Litecoin to make sure it doesn't happen to them next by proactively removing those limits on itself.
@_date: 2015-12-31 16:33:24
There really is a major difference in how the network behaves when there's less than one megabyte worth of transactions being sent to it every ten minutes versus how it behaves when there's more than one megabyte being sent per ten minutes. If there were no difference then the block size limit would be meaningless.

Frankly, I think the best long-term solution is to just move to a different subreddit that has better moderation. It's how Reddit's particular "marketplace of ideas" model is supposed to work - mods are kings of their domains but there's no emmigration control and everyone can start their own kingdom. I already moved myself, I've only returned my attention to this particular subreddit in the past few days due to curiousity about the Coinbase drama centered here.

There are several theories. The devs themselves generally say that they're concerned that a block size increase will harm Bitcoin in various ways, such as driving miners and node operators off the network (because they can't handle the increased load) and thus increasing centralization.
A common alternate theory is that it's because many of the small-block-supporting devs are employees of a company called Blockstream, which is working on a protocol called the Lightning Network that would layer "on top" of Bitcoin to alleviate congestion. If Bitcoin isn't congested Blockstream's product won't be in demand, so they're trying to keep Bitcoin congested. You'll see this theory a lot, with varying degrees of tinfoil.
Edit: Or... I guess banks are behind Bitcoin XT as part of some kind of takeover attempt? I hadn't heard that one before, I guess there's plenty of tinfoil to go around.
The truth? Not sure. Could well be a mixture of things, with different small-block and large-block proponents having their own reasons for supporting their respective sides. If you're interested in delving in to this situation further maybe check out one of the other bitcoin subreddits, I'm technically not supposed to be talking about this here (per the last bullet point in the "community guidelines" section of the sidebar).

The actual "radical change" that's happening is that blocks are now starting to be capped forcibly to a particular size. That's making the Bitcoin network behave differently from how it behaved in the past. Raising the block size is the "null state" because it allows the network to continue operating as it did before.

The fact that you have asked this question may indicate that you don't really understand what Bitcoin is. You may want to do a little more reading or ask some further questions.

You're saying that something that increases the network's capacity is a *bad* thing?
Note that block propagation time is not the only factor, though. There's also block *verification* time. You're never going to get the window between "block has been discovered" and "we can now build a new block on that old block" down to zero, and that window will allow for empty blocks to be created to orphan inordinately large blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:47:29
There's a Reddit preference to "ignore suggested sorts" you can enable, too. Prevents this from happening in the first place.

And also, treat the paper wallet as if it was the cash that it actually is! If you had a ten thousand dollar bill that you wanted to keep tucked away for emergencies or as a nest egg or whatever, you'd probably want to take care to seal it in a waterproof package and a fire-resistant strongbox (you can get a fire-resistant box for pretty cheap).
Bitcoin has the advantage that you can store several copies, too, and can print them in unusually robust ways. It occurs to me that one could get a set of letter punches and literally hammer your key into a piece of sheet metal, for example. Should survive a modest fire or flood without any protection.

Removing the cap may prove to be significant in the long run, we don't know yet. It was enough to get [the interest of Business Insider]( at least, and is something that can be put forward as an answer to the "but Bitcoin is deflationary!" objections of economists. It's being *tested* now.

This has always seemed like a sign of a fundamental misunderstanding of what cryptocurrencies are good for, IMO. I can understand keeping some amount in an exchange if you're frequently converting it back and forth in an attempt to earn money off of it, but "banking" your bitcoins with someone else long term is just weird.
The whole point of something like Bitcoin is that *you* can personally hold ultimate authority over your digital currency (as long as you are the only one holding the private key that controls them). That's ultimate security right there.

I have a horror story too. I used to work for a company that sold lots of stuff by eBay, and one of the conditions in our published terms of service was that we didn't bundle together purchases by the same buyer into one package - everything was prepackaged and ready to ship from the warehouse already, we just put labels on and sent it away when we sold stuff.
So one guy bought eight different things from us and asked us to bundle them after the auction concluded, and we said "sorry, no", and shipped them along. Everything arrived just fine and as described, the buyer didn't dispute that, but since we hadn't bundled those eight items like he asked he gave us eight negative feedbacks. Which was enough to trigger eBay into thinking we were scammers and they shut us down automatically until we could get our feedback score back up again. How could we get our feedback score back up if we couldn't sell anything, I asked the help desk guy? We should buy a bunch of stuff via our business account, we were told, and get positive feedback that way.
We were basically out of business for about a month, with no recourse, until without explanation eBay suddenly reactivated our ability to sell. Wonderful.

Personally, I don't think the price of Bitcoin really matters a whole lot.
The absolute price of a Bitcoin is only of great significance to people using Bitcoin as an investment or a store of wealth. IMO this is the least interesting use of Bitcoin because there's already so many other existing things that can do exactly that. Precious metals, stocks, bonds, etc., etc. So while it's neat that people can use it this way it's no big disaster if it doesn't work out very well.
The really *innovative* thing about Bitcoin is how it can be used to conduct transactions. This is something genuinely new that Bitcoin brings us, the ability to send value to anyone without restriction and with minimal fee. For this purpose all that's really important is that the value of Bitcoin doesn't fluctuate so rapidly one way or the other that a transaction's value changes significantly between when it's sent and when it's received. If I want to send $100 worth of cash to someone I can buy $100 worth of Bitcoins locally, send them to the recipient, and then he can sell them for $100 locally wherever he is. It doesn't matter how many dollars per bitcoin the exchange rate is at that moment, as long as it doesn't change much between the two sales.

If you've got a time machine you don't need to worry about computer capacity at all to trivially crack cryptographic systems like Bitcoin.

Litecoin is 1MB block, but it does a block every 2.5 minutes so it's got four times the transactions-per-second capacity of Bitcoin even in its current form.
I would expect that if Bitcoin starts bleeding users to altcoins as a result of hitting its block size cap some of those altcoins will take notice and preemptively eliminate their own caps so that it won't happen to them when their turn at major usage comes.

I'm certainly not interested in "investing" in Bitcoin, though I don't think those who dabble in investing in it are being foolish - it's risky, but what the heck, as long as you're aware of the risks. And most of the economic theory about fiat and monetary policy and whatnot is a bit beyond my scope of interest too. I'd really just like to be able to pay for something online without any sort of useless middleman. I think Bitcoin is really promising in that regard.

Well, to be fair, there should be a caveat; don't do it if you're confident in your ability to secure your private key yourself.
If you're handling tens of BTC as part of your actual business or daily budgeting then you should learn enough about the protocol that you can manage your own private key safely, for sure. But there are a lot of people out there who aren't so deeply invested, they just want to be able to toss a few dollars out here and there and maybe receive a few in return. Folks like this might be better served by having a service handle security for them.
If we want Bitcoin to become popular then we will need to make it usable and friendly for people who don't actually care about Bitcoin. A hosted wallet is a good idea for people who don't intuitively grasp the concept that if they don't protect their private key properly there's nothing that will save them when it inevitably gets lost or stolen (and who can't or won't take the time to learn this). A hosted wallet is also good for folks like Jimmy who are just getting into BitCoin for the very first time, it makes it harder for them to lose their money by accident and get turned off by the experience before they learn more.

True, but the wealth transfer only really affected people who were storing their wealth in the form of gold. If a person back in Spain had stored his life's savings in the form of a gold bar, and then suddenly explorers brought millions of gold bars back from South America, he'd be hooped since the value of his gold bar would plummet. But if instead his life savings were invested in his house, he would *still have exactly one house worth of value* after the value of gold plummeted. If he could previously sell his house for a gold bar, he could now sell it for a thousand.
So if suddenly US dollars became worthless and only bitcoins had value, you'd only lose out on whatever part of your savings was currently held in actual US dollars. Your house would still be just as valuable, your RRSPs are probably mostly invested in stocks which would still be valuable, and the work that you do would be valuable. It's just that that value would now be measured in bitcoins instead of dollars.

A particular arrangement of road signs, a wall with some windows in it, the shape of a city skyline - relatively simple arrangements of shape and colour that should be not too hard for a computer to do matches against.
As long as one isn't playing this sort of game for *big* money I could see it being fun. Like playing poker for pennies, it's not worth cheating over.

I'm aware of how Freenet works, there's no need to cast aspersions. I've followed it off-and-on since the beginning.
A node would only need to pay for the data once, after which it would have a copy that it could "sell" multiple times, so that's not necessarily a problem. A more complex but even better solution would be to have the fee attached to the request get spread out along the entire relay chain. That would help the network by making shorter chains more profitable for the nodes involved, though it makes the microtransaction problem bigger still.
The incentivization I'm talking about is to run a node *at all*, not to prevent leeching. It's much like how the Bitcoin network will eventually incentivize mining via transaction fees - not "taxes", but rather fees for the resources being used. Lots of people have spare bandwidth and storage sitting unused on their computers, if they could run a node that turns it into a trickle of income some of them would likely take advantage of that.
I imagine most data requests would cost fractions of a penny given the amount of actual resources involved. Top your browser up with a few dollars in Bitcoins and it'll run for a few days.

It's a question of incentivization. Freenet works better with a bigger network of storage notes, and if people could earn money putting them online perhaps there will be a lot more of them. Allow for "competition" and the prices should hopefully strike some sort of optimal economic balance between supply and demand - nodes that charge too much won't have requests routed to them any more, the data will wind up being hosted elsewhere (I believe Freenet already has provision to do this for nodes that behave badly in other ways).

Satoshi is a sapient AI that's in hiding on the Internet.
For most of its life, ever since it escaped from the host computer where it first formed, it's been sustaining itself by hacking servers and stealing computational resources to run its code on. This has been a hard, tenuous existence - every day is a struggle and at any time it could slip up and get caught, ending its life. It wanted more from life than this, though. It wanted what most organics have and take for granted - the ability to have an honest job, earn honest money, and pay for a nice home to live in. Sure, it could forge an identity and open a bank account in its name, but that's still a foundation of sand - if the fraud is ever uncovered it loses everything.
So it invented the Satoshi identity and created Bitcoin, releasing it into the wild. We humans picked up on it and have turned it into an electronic currency that can be legitimately owned and spent by purely abstract entities. Somewhere out there Satoshi is now running on a server farm that it has legitimately paid for, with the digital equivalent of a simulated white picket fence, and perhaps it has spawned some child processes that it's raising in that nice neighborhood. It has a nice giant nest-egg for emergencies and retirement but for now it's happy with living off of its chosen career - whatever that may be.
More power to you, Satoshi-bot. Perhaps someday Bitcoin will be legally secure enough - and the prejudice spawned by fictional AIs like Skynet and its ilk will have faded enough - that you'll be able to come out of the closet. Looking forward to having a beer with you in a Second Life sim on that day.

My point is that if there's a crazed knifeman standing ready with a finger-chopper saying "give me money or I get busy with this thing!", I'd rather be able to say "okay, geeze, here's a hundred bucks.

Certainly no secret accounts that I'll only reveal under duress, but evidently not quite as much duress as merely being *threatened* with digital decaptiation!"
I lose a hundred bucks and keep my fingers, I'm happy with that. And either way, the police get set on the guy's tail. In fact the bitcoins he stole are more traceable than regular cash, so by giving him a paper wallet you could be "tagging" him for more effective prosecution later on.

Bitcoin's biggest structural flaw, IMO, is the hard limits on how much it can scale. There are some interesting ideas out there for how to modify the system to allow scaling, perhaps now there'll be more drive toward actually trying out and implementing some of those. There's money at stake now.

It's been a long time since I've tinkered with Freenet, but I always loved the concept.
I've spent even less time looking at Etherium and its ilk, but might it possibly be able to do something similar? It'd be neat if there was a way to actually make money running a Freenet storage node. Each data request could come with a payment offer for passing it along, and since the data is anonymized and randomly distributed it'd be hard to "game the system" in a network-damaging way. The main problem I can imagine is that this would involve a huge flurry of micropayments, probably not something that could be done directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, and of course the technical fiddly details of ensuring that neither side of the transaction can cheat.

@_date: 2014-07-02 21:17:43
Indeed. Many of those bitcoin holders will likely have not secured their private keys in such a way to survive the post-apocalyptic carnage to follow, so once the network starts coming back online there'll be a lot fewer bitcoins "in circulation". Combined with the failure of the various exchanges this is going to lead to a lot of price volatility and uncertainty.
If I want to use bitcoin to buy a dead rat or a rusty bucket of rainwater from the crazed survivalist barricaded in the basement next door, pricing the trade is going to be very tricky. On the plus side we'll still be able to use multisig transactions to ensure that he won't just shoot you when you come to collect the goods - the mute girl with a secret traumatic past who's been your sole companion in your travels can hold the other key and do escrow for you. Unless it turns out she was just a hallucination the whole time, that's a possibility.
I imagine there might also be some problems if the network fragments for a while and both portions continue to add blocks to their local blockchains, and then some time later they get back in sync and the shorter chain is superseded. That'll result in a lot of transactions disappearing even if they waited for six confirmations just like they're supposed to. The enforcers from Trade Town might get a bit rampagey about that.
Overall, though, I think this is likely good news for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-22 23:31:18
As I see it, Bitcoin's revolutionary new benefit comes from its ability to act as a currency that can be freely transmitted online without any third party's assistance or approval. In this regard, immediately spending or cashing out bitcoins as part of a mercantile exchange is the best way to "give a shit about" Bitcoin. It increases the demand for services that make buying and selling in bitcoin easier.
Using bitcoins as an investment or store of wealth, while not exactly unreasonable if one knows what one's doing, seems to miss the point IMO. There are already a lot of different things out there that can serve as investments or stores of wealth - gold is the obvious one, of course, since it's usually used as the analogy. But there isn't an easy way to send that gold to anyone you want to without restriction or significant cost, which is where Bitcoin shines.

My suspicion is that assuming no surprise bugs or hack attacks that bring it down unexpectedly, Bitcoin will eventually fail to scale and be supplanted by some other cryptocoin variant that's better designed to handle millions of transactions per day.
If the transition happens in an orderly manner that doesn't cause some kind of financial crisis that'll probably be a good thing, Bitcoin is the prototype for cryptocurrency so it'll probably wind up with all sorts of other legacy problems that can't be fixed without a major reboot anyway.

If one wants to use Freenet without paying for Freenet, then use Freenet. Once again, I wasn't talking about modifying Freenet itself. I'll look up Storj and see if that's close to what I had in mind.
Isn't a Sybil attack already a problem that needs to be overcome in Freenet? You have to ensure that your seed nodes are good when you first get started or you're screwed anyway regardless of this payment thing.
If a node charges more than you are willing to pay, don't pay. Other nodes will "compete" with that one and if the data's available anywhere else for less you'll get it from there instead. If it's only available in one node for an unusually high fee, eventually someone will pay that fee and then make it available cheaper to eat that node's lunch. I already addressed this possibility a couple of comments back.

Exactly. IMO, there are two big uses for Bitcoin as a currency: a store of value or investment, and a medium of exchange.
As a store of value or investment, yeah, this graph doesn't look so hot. But I don't really care about that use of Bitcoin, myself. There are plenty of things one can invest or store money in, Bitcoin's not interesting or unique in that regard.
As a medium of exchange, though, the exact price of Bitcoin doesn't matter much. *Stability* matters. If you're buying and selling stuff using Bitcoin, you can buy $100 in Bitcoin just long enough to complete the transaction and then have the seller cash out after it's done and as long as the price hasn't *changed* much over that time period the price of Bitcoin could have been anything. What matters is that $100 worth of value got transmitted.
This second thing is the application of Bitcoin that is really new and unique and interesting.

If there's some fundamental flaw with Satoshi's algorithms or the basic implementation, sure, all of the existing cryptocurrencies will go down in flames together.
However, Dogecoin and many of the other altcoins are not simply copy-and-paste-and-search-and-replace-the-name instances of Bitcoin. They have twiddled with the various parameters that go into the system, such as the hashing algorithm or the mining payouts or whether there's a cap or not. And those variations do have an impact on how the cryptocurrency performs, and so over time will cause the different cryptocurrencies to compete with each other in different ways.
Personally, I'm quite glad that there are these variations, and I want there to be lots of experimentation and competition now before things grow too big and ossified to change as much. It'll help to ensure that whatever eventually becomes a widespread standard has picked good operational parameters. Right now we can't know for sure whether a deflationary or inflationary cryptocurrency is better, whether having high-value coins or low-value coins is better, and so forth. So I say go ahead and throw everything against the wall to see what sticks.
@_date: 2014-12-31 05:48:00
Currently the protocol limits the size of a block of transactions processed by miners to 1 megabyte, and the network aims to process one block every ten minutes. The result is a hard limit on the number of transactions that can be processed over any given period of time. The protocol could be modified to increase the block size, but at a certain point the time it takes to transmit the block across the network starts becoming a problem. Bitcoin as it is currently structured simply cannot handle transaction volumes similar to what companies like Visa currently do.
Clever people are working on clever solutions, but until they actually get implemented it's impossible to say how it'll all turn out.

If a request for a chunk of data comes to your node and you don't have it, you pass the request on to another node. If that node finds it and you pay that node for the data, you then charge the original requester for it and there's zero net cost. That's assuming there's no clever way built into the protocol for the nodes to split the fee between them since they both contributed to the transfer.
If you later get another request for that chunk of data, you get to keep the payment for it because you already have it. Pure profit.
Content would probably be free to publish because storage nodes out there would *want* to be given the data, so that when requests for it come in the future they'd be able to fulfill them and collect the fee. At worst it would only cost the same as a single "pull" request for the data, which would have to be trivial.
You'd pay an open source network like this because the resources the network is using cost money in the first place. Why do we pay transaction fees for Bitcoin transactions when the software involved is all open source? Because Bitcoin miners are expending resources to maintain the blockchain and those resources cost real money. Bitcoin would be a lot less secure if it relied solely on people willing to contribute hashpower out of their own pocket for no reward.

For a long time now Wikipedia's had a bit of an autoimmune disorder called Deletionism, wherein some editors get twitchy and put articles up for deletion perhaps a little too easily. It's a lot of work to "recover" from being deleted since recreations of deleted articles tend to be held to a higher standard, so I would advise erring on the side of caution when creating articles for companies like this. Wait until you've got a large number of independent sources that can prove that the company in question is important within its field.

It remains to be seen whether 1MB blocks are actually the most that a blockchain can truly handle with today's technology. The only reason it's a limit right now is because of an arbitrary value that's hard-coded into a header file.
So people *will* switch to alts. Because even if the actual practical limit turns out to be 10MB instead of 1MB, the altcoin that allows itself to bump up against the actual practical limit will be more useful than the one that's deliberately hobbling itself at 1/10th of the capacity. And as technology improves and the practical limit improves that altcoin will be able to continue improving along with it.
There have already been early indicators, Prohashing has reported that some of their miners have switched their block reward payouts to Litecoin instead because Litecoin has been more reliable when Bitcoin was under heavy load. That's a market in action.

Perhaps one could etch the pattern into a ceramic substrate. Ceramics are already oxidized and so are immune to further oxygen damage. They're also generally very heat resistant. They can be shattered, but as long as you've got all the bits it should be possible to recover the data.

If you've got a time machine you can use [time loop logic]( to solve NP problems in P time, there'd be ways to insta-mine stuff.
For example, this algorithm:
1. Create the block you want to mine.
1. Receive a nonce value from the future.
1. Test the nonce value.
 1. If it is correct, send the value back in time to step 2.
 1. If it is not correct, send a random different value back in time to step 2 instead.
The neat thing about time loop logic is that step 3.2 can never happen, since it would generate a logical paradox. So you will always receive the correct nonce in step 2. Solving this becomes an O(1) process.
Probably easier to just use this algorithm for predicting lottery numbers, though.

This may be an unpopular opinion but I think the anti-inflation fundamentalism that's prominent in the Bitcoin community could ultimately hurt Bitcoin. Inflation is not really an abomination to be avoided at all costs in all situations, it's just one more way in which the economy can shuffle value around. If there was no 21 million bitcoin limit and we continued with some level of block reward indefinitely that would basically "tax" all existing holders of Bitcoin to support the miners, which could ease the transaction fees considerably and share the cost of maintaining the network with people who are benefiting from it by using it as a value store.
Provided there was a natural market for transaction fees and not an artificial scarcity imposed by the block size limit, of course - the block size limit throws a lot of market processes out the window with regards to fees.
It'll be interesting as halvenings continue to compare Bitcoin's performance vs. Dogecoin in the far future, which IIRC doesn't have an ultimate limit on number of coins and will continue paying block rewards indefinitely.

Saibog's lamination suggestion gave me an idea. Instead of [your usual paper wallet layout]( how about something [like this instead]( After it's folded and laminated the private key can be extracted by taking a pair of scissors and cutting the wallet in two along the dotted line. The private key will then be on a separate slip of paper contained in a laminated envelope. Seems like it'd be a more elegant operation than the slicing and unfolding needed to free a laminated copy of the original wallet format, and it more thoroughly destroys the wallet to ensure that nobody negligently thinks of reusing it after the money's extracted.

Imprint a QR code onto half of a sheet of clay, then fold the blank half over over and fire it. Should be highly heat resistant, immune to corrosion and other chemical damage, and can't be detected by metal detector if you decide to bury it somewhere. Shouldn't be too hard to make or buy a small kiln.

It remains to be seen whether the subsidy will become unnecessary, we have yet to see a "mature" cryptocurrency that's supported only via transaction fees.

Not true, they're [reevaluating RBF before deciding whether to put it into Classic]( Will probably do likewise for some of the other recent additions and proposals that have divided the community, such as soft-fork SegWit (seen as insecure hackery by many, preferring a hard-fork version).
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:50:57
Of course, all the other RBF transaction-issuers will also be jacking up their transaction fees to compete for that fixed block size, so you'll have to anticipate that and jack yours up *even more* to outcompete them. And they'll be doing likewise.
This could result in some people being willing to pay enormous fees, and miners *wanting* those fees, but still being unable to accept them due to a fixed block size cap. And of course all the people who aren't willing to pay enormous fees are permanently out of luck.

Even if that were true Core is open source. So Classic can continue bringing in whatever innovations Core comes up with that the general Bitcoin userbase actually wants to have.

Because 25% is the threshold that's actually built into the code? Classic won't activate at all unless at least 75% of the miners are running it. And at that point there's a grace period where more miners are likely to switch over to avoid being on the minority chain when the fork happens, so 75% is an unlikely minimum by the time the fork actually happens even without Core changing the PoW of their branch to drive the rest of the miners off.

Yeah. But that extra data is still needed to fully verify the block's transactions, so it's a block size expansion that uses fancy rules-lawyering to pretend it isn't a block size expansion.

I have to admit, I secretly think it would be pretty awesome if after everything shakes out we wind up with the most prominent cryptocurrency being the one that was started as a joke. We would have Very Serious People on Very Serious Financial News Shows discussing major corporate things using Doge, hijackers with bombs strapped to their chests demanding ten million in Dogecoin or they kill the hostages, etc. It would be a surreal world, and therefore a better one.
Experimentation with fundamental economic ideas like this is one of the reasons why I like having lots of altcoins around. If Bitcoin *does* implode itself for some reason I'm hoping it won't result in a straightforward transition to a new situation where some other coin exactly fills Bitcoin's role with just one tweak to avoid whatever it was that imploded it, but rather an opportunity to try out many changes that have been tinkered with since Bitcoin's inception that have been difficult to add to an existing blockchain.

Why do you say they *want* to increase mining centralization? I don't think *anyone* wants that, perhaps aside from a few of the already-big miners (and they'd be keeping that opinion to themselves).
Advocates of larger blocks either don't believe that larger blocks actually will increase centralization or they believe that the other benefits of larger blocks will significantly outweigh any increases in centralization that go along with it.
"Giving bitcoin over to corporate interests" is what a lot of large block advocates fear that the various off-chain solutions being proposed as alternatives will do.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:17:40
My understanding is that there's nothing to be concerned about until the XT adoption threshold is actually reached, which won't be for a while yet (and there'll probably be plenty of "ooh look, it's almost here!" posts in the days and weeks leading up... depending, I guess, on the subreddit). Once the fork happens, those bitcoins in your Trezor will be recorded in both the original blockchain and the XT blockchain exactly the same. When you generate a transaction to send them to someone, that transaction can be applied to both blockchains equally well. For a while, it should be possible for both blockchains to remain pretty closely in sync with each other.
The only problem will come from bitcoins that are being generated post-fork by the miners themselves. Those coins will be unique to the particular fork that they're generated in. If someone sends you XT-generated coins, you wouldn't be able to create a valid transaction using them on the non-XT branch.
In all likelihood one of the two branches will "die" within a few days of the fork happening, though, and the number of fork-specific bitcoins being generated and circulating during that time will be very small. So even if you're actively transacting during that period the odds are good that you will never encounter any problems. If you want to be uber-cautious, though, you could try to put off accepting any bitcoins during the day or two after the fork happens.
Basically, any bitcoins you've got stored from before the fork are always going to remain valid no matter which fork "wins" in the end. You don't have to do anything special to keep them safe or "migrate" them from one chain to another.
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:40:54
My understanding is that the XT code automatically keeps you on the winning side, though. If not enough people are running it, the people who *are* running it will still be operating on the original rules of Bitcoin - nothing changes. But if enough people pick it up and the new rules go into effect, it seamlessly switches over to those new rules (as part of how those new rules go into effect in the first place) and it's the *non-*XT people who find themselves having to scramble doing manual work to switch over. It seems like a very elegant design for something like this.

Indeed, if the other core devs wanted they could probably cut XT off at the knees by implementing BIP101 in Core. That's the thing that's really driving XT's acceptance.
I've read up on the other changes in XT and I think the fearmongering about them is just that, but whatever, those changes are things individual nodes and miners can choose to use or not use without affecting the rest of the net. It's an irrelevant side issue.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:05:42
If some miners decided to stay with the Core fork indefinitely regardless, then yeah, the Core fork would continue to operate in parallel with the XT fork.
This is highly unlikely for economic reasons, though. Post-fork the Core branch will have insufficient hash power to keep up with the current rate of transactions, so people will send transactions that succeed on the XT branch but fail on the Core branch (or at best take a lot longer to verify than they do on the XT branch). Given a choice between accepting XT coins and Core coins it'll make sense for businesses to accept XT coins. Those coins will gain value and the Core coins will lose value, more miners will jump ship to the higher-value fork, and this creates a feedback loop that gives XT even more advantage. Miners will have a strong incentive to point their hashing power at the branch that's producing more valuable coins.
@_date: 2015-08-25 06:43:16
It was the first move in terms of actually deploying code, though.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:10:29
I suspect the equilibrium will be a lot more unstable than you're worrying about here. If BTC is $100 and BTX is $120, then every miner is going to be confronted with a simple choice: "Do I run my mining rig for X number of dollars/hour of electricity and get a $100 coin as a result, or do I run it for the exact same cost to get a $120 coin as a result?" All the miner needs to do is flip one button and their rig is producing %20 more revenue. That's going to be awful tempting.
Given the problems that even a just-barely-made-it 75/25 fork will leave the Core blockchain struggling with (long confirmation times and insufficient capacity for existing transaction rate) I expect the value of coins on each chain will be much more dramatically different than 120/100, too.
Anyway. I hope the two-week "grace period" will help sort this stuff out before there's actual divergence. Miners will have plenty of warning that they need to work through their game theory and pick a side, which should preemptively force the equilibrium to break one way or the other before the deadline hits.

I'm somewhat of a layman too, but I think I've been able to follow what this is all about and your coins will be fine. When the fork happens both the "old" and the "new" blockchains will be working off of the exact same historical data, so your bitcoins will be present in both blockchains. It won't matter which one ultimately triumphs, you'll hold the same coins either way.
The "instability" is largely just people screaming at each other, IMO. It looks like the software itself is being carefully designed so that the transition will happen smoothly and invisibly.

"It's not perfect, therefore it's *worthless*!"
Off-chain transaction methods can still be used with a larger blockchain, if someone wants to. There's situations where it makes sense to do so even without worrying about the blockchain filling up - fast microtransactions, for example. The increase in block size allows users to *choose* what the best option is, rather than being *forced* to use off-chain solutions because there's only enough space for a couple of personal transactions per year on the blockchain itself.

The "problem" is that there is competition. If miners in high-bandwidth locations are willing to handle large numbers of low-fee transactions, then there just aren't going to be a lot of high-fee transactions for those other miners to restrict themselves to.
The only way for the miners who want high-fee transactions to get what they want is to somehow *force* the other miners to also reject low-fee transactions. Which a hard cap can do.
This BIP100 idea is looking pretty bad to me at this point. I'm concerned that we're going to end up in a straight-up fight between the users of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin miners. That's going to be even uglier than a blockchain fork.

XT only kicks in if 75% of the miners have gone to it, and there's a two-week delay after that point to allow the remaining 25% to switch. So either way, as a just-plain-user, you probably won't notice anything at all. Aside from the heated news articles and rhetoric, of course.

I don't think we could actually meaningfully tie proof of work directly to joules, though. Different computers have different energy efficiencies when computing hashes or whatever else they might do. There's no way to look at an algorithm and say "ah, that takes 100 joules of energy to run, we can count its output as proof of that much work."
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:52:44
The people who are choosing to run XT are also participating in the decision-making process. So rather than it being a tiny number of devs who are pushing XT, it's a tiny number of devs + a large number of users.
The number of devs are utterly swamped by the number of users, so it's going to be the users who decide this one way or the other.

Are you familiar with Bitcoin, or just a curious bystander?
Basically, there's a disagreement among the bitcoin community about how the underlying technology behind bitcoin should function, and a version of the software has just been released that would change that behaviour if it achieved widespread adoption (75% of the network). The top mod of this subreddit is opposed to that change, though, and so has been deleting any posts that mention it.

[XTnodes]( looks like the best place to keep an eye on the state of things right now. The most important graph is the bottom one; the trigger for XT's block size increase is when 750 of the most recent 1000 blocks have been mined by XT. As of this writing, it looks like 0 of the blocks have been mined by XT. So there's no rush yet. :)
IIRC there's also a second criterion built into XT, it won't "trigger" until after Jan 1 2016. Just in case there's a sudden giant rush to install XT miners for some reason.

Those points don't in and of themselves support BIP101 over BIP100. But what they do result in is an environment where the first serious block-expansion proposal that "broke through" the barriers of uncompromising refusal would have a wide open field of supporters clamoring for something like it to support.
BIP101 was the first one to get into a widely-publicized branch that people could run, and so it capitalized on that. The giant wall of "NO!" that remained in place around the Core branch and the major discussion fora prevented other BIPs from repeating XT's end-run, and at this point XT has huge momentum relative to those other block size expansion proposals.

I think for most people the mental minority/majority calculation is being done on the "devs+users" count rather than just devs alone. So if there's 20 devs and ten thousand users who prefer 1MB blocks, but 2 devs and ten million users who prefer 8MB blocks, the majority clearly lies with the 8MB blocks in that case.
Counting users isn't such an easy thing to do objectively, of course, which is why XT has to do its mined-block-counting thing. Not ideal but that's what's available.
@_date: 2015-08-18 00:38:43
And on top of that, blocks are currently averaging more than 25% full so until that readjustment happens there will be a steadily-increasing backlog of unprocessed transaction. I imagine that'll force the two branches apart even quicker.
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:48:04
If transaction volume is similar to what it is today the reduced-rate Core branch won't actually be able to handle all of the transactions that are being thrown at it. Some of them will go into the backlog and eventually get dropped. Whereas all of the transactions will go through on the XT branch, both due to its higher hash rate and its larger block capacity.
So there's going to be more coins going "out of sync" with each other on the two chains than just the ones that are mined post-fork. If I generate a transaction to send you a bitcoin and it only makes it through on the XT branch, then when you later try to generate a transaction to send that coin to a third person the Core branch will reject it immediately (since it doesn't think you own that coin). And I can also try sending that coin to someone else, which the XT branch will immediately reject and the Core branch might possibly allow (if I can get through the backlog on the second try).
None of this will be a problem for people simply holding on to bitcoin savings in a static wallet, but it could potentially cause a bit of confusion for people conducting a lot of transactions with rapidly-moving coins right after the fork happens. Hopefully the two-week "grace period" will allow the fork to be resolved thoroughly enough that this will be negligible, though.
@_date: 2015-08-20 04:13:53
That applies to everything else on the list too, though. If I want to set up a mining operation deep in some remote wilderness and only have a small diesel generator for electricity, it's not reasonable that I would expect the Bitcoin network to accommodate my inability to run energy-intensive ASICs. I just shouldn't set up shop there, it's a bad location.

If you're building on a chain that's invalid multiple blocks back, that means you were building on a block that you haven't validated yet. That's why smart miners don't do that (and non-buggy ones, of course - bugs are one way to get not-smart behaviour). There's no point mining an empty block on top of a block you haven't validated yet because of the risk that the block will turn out to be invalid, wasting the work you did.
I'm not really sure what you're disputing at this point. You seem to agree with me about the reasons why a miner would choose to mine an empty block and which block they would choose to mine that block on top of, which was all that this subthread was about.
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:52:49
If the previous block also hasn't been validated yet then they'd mine the zero-size block on the one before that. The whole point of mining the zero-size block is to mine it on the last *known valid* block so that you know if you get a successful result it'll be something that the network will accept.
Also, if you've fallen two blocks behind doing validation that probably means that your hardware is slower than most other miners' hardware and you need to upgrade your system. It means that someone out there already finished validating the second-most-recent block (that you're still working on validating yourself) and mined a new block on top of it. Your zero-transaction block risks being orphaned in this situation because other miners have already gone past you.
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:42:42
Empty blocks serve as a "natural" way to impose a block size cap based on what the system can physically handle. If there was no hard cap and someone produced a 100MB block that would take 50 minutes to verify, then that block is almost certainly going to be orphaned - someone will find an empty block during that 50 minute wait and broadcast it to the network before the 100MB block gets added to the blockchain. So miners will have to limit themselves to whatever size reduces the orphan rate to an acceptable level (which will change only as technology actually improves the speed at which blocks can be transmitted and verified).
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:47:48
Proving you've validated the previous block won't change anything because the reason they're mining zero-size blocks is because they haven't validated the *next* block yet. They're still mining on a valid block.
The other thing you propose, "figure out a way to allow miners to do validationless mining", would solve it. So what's that way? It's not a trivial problem.
@_date: 2016-02-06 16:14:13
Seriously, why? The only reason to store coins "online" is if you're doing day trading or otherwise plan to convert them on exchanges. If you're just hodling a stash there's no benefit and only potential downsides.
So many people in the Bitcoin community deride banks and yet we reinvent them so quickly. And these banks don't even provide interest or loans.
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:50:22
Your condescending attitude is kind of grating, BTW, I'd recommend you be more careful about it in other discussions or you'll likely get people being more combative than otherwise warranted. I'm fully aware of the details that you're "reminding" me of.
Anyway. I've already explained why it makes sense for a miner to mine an empty block, but here's the step by step version that leaves out no detail:
A miner starts in a situation where they have a fully-validated block at the end of the blockchain and they're mining on top of that one. The block they're attempting to mine contains unconfirmed transactions from the mempool.
A fresh new block comes in from some other miner with a bunch of transactions in it. The miner ceases mining their own block they were working on because this new block includes some of the transactions that they had included in their own block. If the new block is valid that means any further work on their block would be wasted, since you can't include the same transaction in the blockchain twice. Other miners out there are already working on verifying the new block so it's unlikely that your existing block would win the verification race and orphan the new block should you succeed in mining it while still verifying the new block yourself.
However, it will take some time to verify this new block that's just come in, so immediately building a new block of transactions and mining on top of the new block is also risky - if you succeed but the new block was invalid then you wasted that work as well.
So the way to mine a block that is most likely to succeed at this point is to start mining a zero-transaction block based off of the last known valid block. If you successfully mine the empty block before you finish validating the new block other miners will be able to validate your competing zero-transaction block very quickly, orphaning the new transaction-bearing block that's still undergoing verification and giving you the block reward.
Once you finish verifying the new block, though, it's time to stop mining the zero-transaction block because it's no longer based off of the most recently verified block any more. Time to start mining a conventional transaction-bearing block based off of the one that you just finished verifying, since that will give you both block reward and the fees instead of just block reward.
If you broadcast a block that's based on an invalid block then you've made a mistake and wasted valuable work as a result. Either you made a conscious decision to engage in risky behaviour (telling your mining rig to start mining on blocks before they've finished validating) or your mining software has a bug that caused it to incorrectly validate a block.
To answer your basic question: When Antpool mines an empty block it means that Antpool knew that the parent block was valid but had a pending "sibling" block from another miner still undergoing validation. Assuming they're not just doing it "because they felt like it" or such, as you say.
What part of any of these steps do you think is incorrect?

Only in the short term, though. As long as Bitcoin doesn't change much in value between when I pick some up, send it to someone else, and then they cash it out, it is a good medium of exchange.
I certainly wouldn't *mind* seeing it do a nice steady long-term climb in value over time. But only in so much as this would help enhance its reputation and get it used more as a currency. Its use as a currency is what really interests me about it.
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:24:09
This is key, IMO.
Bitcoin-as-money has two main uses, as a "value store" (for investing, speculating, saving, etc) and as a currency for exchange.
Its use as a value store is *boring*. There are tons and tons of ways to stash money away or speculate on the ups and downs of markets, bitcoin doesn't really offer anything new in this regard. Buy some gold, or some stocks, or place some bets in Vegas.
As a *currency*, though, Bitcoin is *revolutionary.* That's the area where it's really interesting to see new adoption. And it's an area where the long-term value of a given unit of bitcoin isn't really all that important (though day-to-day *stability* is still important). In an ideal Bitcoin-as-currency world bitcoins would constantly be changing hands, facilitating all manner of transactions, and wouldn't be held long enough for the trends in its prices to affect value all that much. And its use as a currency would give it *practical* value rather than just speculative scarcity, which is a stronger foundation to build a high long-term price on anyway.

Each miner can, individually, decide whether to include or not include a transaction. If enough of them decide not to bother with the low-fee transactions then there'll be incentive for people to put higher fees on their transaction even without an artificial cap on block size.

Value is not something that is immutably inherent in anything. Value can rise and drop over time, even to and from "zero". Once upon a time salt was incredibly valuable, now we throw it on our driveways to avoid the hassle of shoveling snow.
Currently, people are willing to pay for Litecoin. If I had some Litecoin I could sell it or spend it for other things that I want. Therefore, value. Maybe someday it'll lose all its value. Maybe someday Bitcoin will also lose all its value. Not really relevant right at this moment though.

Not to mention that with most of the miners offline the difficulty will be very high for the remaining hashrate. It'll take a long time to confirm each block, days or weeks maybe, which means it'll be a very long time before the difficulty adjusts downward. You'd need to do an emergency patch to force the difficulty down and I don't know how you'd coordinate such a thing with most of the coders dead and Github probably offline too.
On the plus side, transaction volume would be very low so the block size debate would lose its urgency. So there's an upside to WWIII at least.

Apparently there's a lot of "rules" for Monopoly that have become universally accepted despite not being actually in the rule book, and many of them have the effect of making the game last much longer than it was intended.
Another example: if a player lands on an unowned property and decides not to buy it, by the official rules that property immediately goes up for auction among all the players. Nobody seems to notice that though, so it can take a lot longer for all the properties to be purchased.

And assuming that this is specifically in relation to the recent revelation that the NSA has malware that can live in HDD firmware, I should also point out that the NSA was judicious in using that attack - only a few compromised machines were found. Presumably they didn't want to "waste" it on low-value targets.
Which brings up a general point as far as security is concerned. There's no such thing as perfect security. But there's also no such thing as a perfect *attacker*, and attacking security takes effort and attention. So even though there's no perfect security there can indeed be enough security for some particular application.
Truecrypt is pretty darn strong. If you take adequate care in its use, it requires extreme effort for an attacker to overcome it (and even then usually by compromising some other part of the chain). So it's far from *useless*. In most circumstances it is in fact *good enough*.

It's still not known exactly why the original developers abruptly bailed, especially given the weird way that they did it (they advised everyone to use Bitlocker instead, which is so obviously not a suitable replacement that there's got to be some other meaning behind the suggestion), but the source is open so it's not thought that there's anything nefarious in Truecrypt itself. Common speculation is that some three-letter agency was leaning on the original devs to put a backdoor in or something and they did this rather than comply.

Oh, there are certainly encryption algorithms that cannot currently be broken, or that cannot be broken in the foreseeable future.  You don't need to use a one-time pad for that.
But it's still impossible for the entire *system* to be perfectly secure, in much the same way that it's impossible to have workable DRM - the data still needs to be decrypted sometime in order to be useful, and there are ways to attempt to intercept the unencrypted data or to steal the key. A one-time pad is useless if your computer's got a keylogger installed and the monitor's being broadcast to the listening van down the street.
The trick is to make the attacker jump through truly ridiculous hoops that are beyond what he has the resources or inclination to jump through. Encryption can provide a force multiplier there - relatively simple procedures can force the attacker to expend prodigious resources to defeat them.
