Same here, although I think it's just slightly confusing to make that context switch in a sentence. At first your brain thinks the author is talking about Ethereum, but in fact they're talking about "Ethereum Classic". But whatever, that's not all that important as long as people finish reading sentences :P
Now, what would you say if instead of calling it "Ethereum Classic", which I think is very appropriate given their situation, they called it something so generic and confusing as Ethereum Cash or Ethereum Tokens or Ethereum Coins or Ethereum Money? You can't tell me that's not confusing, especially to newcomers.
And just letting you know I don't have any foot in this race (I haven't touched any of my split coins). I use the names Bitcoin Cash and Bcash interchangeably in my conversations, without a second thought. It's simply a shorter way to write it, and it's insane to me that it's offensive. Maybe they'd appreciate BitCash?

Why are you calling it Bitcoin Cash when they, as you just said, want you to call it Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:43:47


That's precisely the problem with calling it Bitcoin Cash.

Did you even try?
I just googled "Invasion of Iraq CNN" and found a ton of results. Here's one:

Try harder.

As opposed to the Bahamian invasion of Iraq?

Seems like your words didn't. You keep making sensational claims that are easily disproved, and then changing what you're asking for.

How'd you conclude he was a leftist from that post? There's a ton of right-leaning folk who don't blindly follow Trump.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:26:41
When did he do that?

That also implies that there are countless users who oppose SegWit2x.

I think you've responded to the wrong person, buddy.

So what should we do first? Give the ISPs total control of the network, or break their monopoly?

It was posted by a regular, who's made many similar posts in the past.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:12:39
Now the user is claiming they were hacked!

It seems like you responded to the wrong post here... unless you're trying to say it's okay for the big ISPs to block competition.

I think he ruined his own point with that last clip. He reads the definition of wet, "covered or saturated with water or another liquid". You can definitely cover water with more water.

... Did you read the article at the top of this thread? You're in a thread about a guy posting a fictional story from the future where North Korea has 180k BTC. All the way at the top of this page, above the comments, is a link called "4 Years ago, a Time-Traveling Redditor Predicted Bitcoins Rise".

What? You just explained that it's that way because your wallet is insisting on the wrong fee.

His name was all over the detailed article about the Craig Wright "proof" event. Here it is, with details about Ayre's shady backing for nChain and CSW.

It's logarithmically scaled, like this chart of the S&amp;P 500 over 60 years: [Wikipedia Image](
Log scale is sometimes more appropriate for data that has growing growth over time.
