Huge! I want the API for developing for this ASAP. Can't Apple ban those enterprise certificates on the next iOs update?

Translation for my english-speaking bitcoiners comrades:
Before anything I would like to greet the event organizers. The developing tools are great, a lot of languages... About the project, we developed it in two days, including the box developed here in the university. We made the drawings and used a laser cutter. The idea of the project is a vending machine that accepts bitcoin. So, we have this prototype, the user has an account linked to bitcoin. Through the cellphone, using a Bitcoin software you can send money to the machine where you are going to make the purchase. 
(1 min, same guy) So we send money to the machine, using a HTTP request to a gateway of bitcoin payments it receives this transaction and add the money to the machine balance. Then, we have a lot of product options that we can buy. 
(guy with green t-shirt) We have some products, and the client is going to use a menu system using left, right and enter buttons to navigate through the product menu, and he is going to buy pressing enter. It is going to show that the product is being purchased, then the machine is going to deliver the product.
(Other blue shirt guy) Very, very cool. Webcam is going to record who is making the purchase. 
(First guy again) Yes, the vending machine was made using two platforms. The ethernet, buttons and external interface was made using interface (unhearable). We also have Node.js for data acquisition. We can make the acquisition independent of the machine.
(Last guy) the machine was designed and made using the resources of Insper. After they showed us that this resources were available we used it (hehe). 100% hackaton 
(everybody clapping hands) Congratulations...
