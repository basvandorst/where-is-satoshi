Is there any room for a BTC seller to lie and say they didn't get the funds? 
Or maybe a banking/postage error causes the funds to not reach the destination, how would Bisq handle those situations?
Saw you posted this below in response to someone else,
"With Bisq, you never deposit your fiat, you simply send it to, or receive it from, your trading partner. Bisq never has custody of your fiat or bitcoin. To keep both parties honest, security deposits are made to a multi-sig address, and there is a dispute resolution process to handle any problems."
How significant are the security deposits? Anyone have experience with making a dispute? 
This service does sound great.

Thank you for the reply! 
Seems like they really thought about this and using arbitration with documentation is probably the best approach they could have taken. 
I can't see any downsides currently.

I want to say the lowest point it will hit during this correction will be around $5,800. Fingers crossed!!!

Okay I think I understand, so this differs from the bitcoin cash fork because this will not have replay protection. Also thank you for responding! I'm kind of leaning towards putting them in coinbase and hoping they keep their word about crediting users with bitcoin stored with them. I got that info from an email they sent out about the fork.

Some exchanges will let you place buy orders so when it hits that price it will buy X amount of coins at that price, if it never hits that price it will not attempt to buy the X amount of coins.
