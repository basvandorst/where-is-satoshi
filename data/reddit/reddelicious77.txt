how are you going to handle the several hundred dollar (in your case, probably thousand) dollar deposit that conventional rental agencies charge when renting.  Are you going to take an extra Bitcoin deposit?  What about liability in general? How would you handle that?
Sorry, I don't want to sound discourage b/c this is a fascinating idea - and I hope it works out - just have some questions is all. Good luck!

yeah, I've been in since Feb 2013, so I've seen the last few big bubbles too - but there's nothing been this long of a lull, before. (I know - you can't use past results to make future predictions.)
It just seems weird though - what w/ the fact that it's more popular than ever. Hmmm. I guess it could change on a dime.

@_date: 2014-10-03 18:53:02
yeah, isn't the unit price "decided" first (based on various market conditions) - and *then* the market cap is simply derived from that?
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:09:20
and if I may add: with the recent good news and overall increase in adoption rate - why is the price still so stagnant (and actually down from the beginning of the year.) It's more popular than ever.
Or, more simply put *what* will be the catalyst that will create another new (much higher) normal?
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:19:38
ah if only people would apply this thinking to politics....
@_date: 2014-08-13 17:42:16
with millions in existence, this goes to show how BTC's are still very much in the early-adoption stage if only a few thousand being sold can affect the price to such an extent (assuming that *is* the reason.)

rare exception here: I went 'all-in' back in Feb of 2013 (they were just over 20 bucks a pop) - just 6 months married, and but I convinced my wife it was a good idea. And I'm not even that persuasive (b/c she was incredibly skeptical/cynical, and she called them 'magic beans' - until later that summer when they were up over 500%)  
Now, being up over 2500% since I bought, and being unemployed, they're going to come in for a great cushion, assuming I don't find work sooner than later. (point is, I held, and only had to sell 2% to get my principle back.)
@_date: 2014-01-11 09:30:00


Really? Shoot - I was feeling all secure in thinking that you had to have 51% control of mining capabilities to rig the system. :(
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:14:52
oh, that doesn't sound quite as bad as I was expecting. (ie- for the network to crash or freeze).  Still, not ideal obviously.
@_date: 2014-08-02 19:15:23


ok, so I'm only running Multibit, but you're saying it's not compatible with it, yet?
@_date: 2014-06-08 05:14:51
yes, so then a centralized entity could potentially have that monopoly control
although according to an article in another thread on this (I just read), it said that even if a 51% attack did occur, "The core developers today are ready to do instant changes... so Bitcoin likely not suffer long term damage even if the attack materialized."
@_date: 2014-07-15 01:53:57
diddo!... I was lucky enough to time the market so that I was able to cash in my principle so I'm at zero risk of losing that. (bought when they were 20, and cashed in my principle at 840 just 8 months later.) 
now, I'm unemployed, and have been for about a year, so worst case scenario, I have a decent nest egg to keep me going. (still have actual cash savings to use, first.)
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:46:57


oh, wait, are you referring to the fact that when you move/spend some coins from one wallet, the 'change' is sent to another one? (is this the public key?)

yep, this is the way to do it... 'dollar cost averaging', I believe is what it's called.  You're not obsessed over the price, and as you say, the key is not spend more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2014-07-15 02:44:40

"What happens when I use TREZOR for the first time?
When running TREZOR for the first time, a master private key is generated and written on a display in a form of 12, 18 or 24 words, depending on the protection strength you choose. It is recommended to write these words down and/or memorize them in order to be able to restore your TREZOR in case it's lost or stolen."
Remember, like w/ a paper wallet, the coins are always on the network, it's just a question of access. So long as you back up your password (the old-fashioned way) - you'll always have access, no matter what happens to your hardware.
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:45:19
Hmm, I guess I always considered that as more vendors came on board, that prices would inevitably rise, but yes I think there would be *some* downward pressure on the price, assuming that they immediately cash out. Then again, as more people get on board, in general - relative demand will go up, adding some upward pressure, too.

hmmm - so you can go around 'locking' public addresses? (ie- so that no one can deposit any more coins into them)...I don't think I follow... if you use an address as the deposit box, I still don't see the point/use for a public key....

Nice analogy, makes sense.
(ie- I look forward to the day that true, offline cold-storage is as quick, easy and fast as saving any file to my USB thumb-drive, and unless it gets that easy, it will never get as popular as e-mail.)
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:24:19
it is... just don't export your key and then delete it from your computer - b/c when you go to import it, you will have to wait for the database to sync from the day you created the wallet (not just exported it.) So, the older it gets, the longer it takes. 
For example, I made a wallet back in April of last year, but then moved them all to another wallet, as it was taking like 6-10 minutes to sync at the time. Now, that 3 month old wallet takes about 2 minutes or so...

chill, bro... it's had many, many chances to go above 50%, and it hasn't.
Even the greediest realize that if they did this, that it would destroy confidence in Bitcoin, and thus, the value.  It would take one hell of a conspiracy by several capable people whose only mission it was to destroy Bitcoin, purposefully. (and yes, I know, these people do exist - but I seriously, seriously doubt their ability to get to this level.)
Almost anything is possible, but, you are sounding pretty hyperbolic at this point.

Like others have mentioned, you still should make a paper back-up... your coins will always exist on the network, it's just a question of accessing them. And there's no better way than physically printing your password.

@_date: 2014-05-03 23:24:49
yeah but hold on, the network requires at least *some* people to download and verify the full blockchain.  It could not sustain itself if *everyone* went to a venue like Multibit. (I know, not a realistic scenario.)
I'm a Multibit user myself, but I know I'm not really helping the community since I'm relying on others to DL and verify the blockchain.

@_date: 2014-06-02 19:59:42
I am using Multibit and for my 'cold-storage' method. (It's not true cold storage, but the key is offline).
 I have simply exported the key to several USB drives, and then delete all traces from my computer... is there anything I should be concerned about? (like I notice it has to sync w/ the network from that day that i exported it, so it takes longer every day that I wait).  Likewise, I realize I am vulnerable whenever I import them back in, but that's the same issue one would have with an actual paper wallet, right?
anyway, I have been doing this for awhile now and consider it pretty bulletproof, I just hope I'm not missing something obviously dangerous. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:34:03
ok, so if I understand this correctly the CC's are appended to a typical Bitcoin transaction? (ie- in other words, at the very least, they'll have to pay a small fee even if they aren't sending a huge wad of BTC's at once?) - they can not be simply sent on their own?
Hmmm, I suppose vandals could still just send the smallest fees possible along w/ the CC's just for the sake of needlessly bloating the blockchain; to do anything to discourage the adoption rate.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:40:54
oh, they don't even ask to actually *see* your savings account balance or the like? They just take your word for it? wow, nice. (There's a TV  show here in Canada, "Border Security", a documentary-style show of border agents here in Canada and they often ask travellers who come visiting long term to prove they can sustain themselves either by showing their acct balance or via someone within the country who will pay for them.)
yeah, as for me, I was pretty sure I was going to get into secondary before I even got to the border - I rented a car and was only going to visit the US for a few hours (red flags for drug trafficking.) While he gave me the 20 question treatment, he was 'nice enough', and wished me well.  I just had to sit in my car for an extra 5 mins while he checked things out.  No big deal, really. I wasn't verbally assaulted or anything.

What? I know I'm not alone - I keep/store all of my own Bitcoins, myself. If some people are dumb enough to get into an exchange that's historically been ripe w/ errors, that's their fault.  
It's unfortunate, b/c like w/ any other instance in human nature, when a minority of ignorant people (ie- people who didn't do their homework) get involved, inevitably get screwed, an outcry occurs, and of course the regulators love this. It only takes a few bad apples to spoil the bunch.


Ah, yes - thank you for this!  This is even better. I mean, for a holder like myself, it goes to show how there's so, so much more room for growth in price. We've barely scratched the surface.  
edit: check it out - in regards to Bitcoin size and scope - there are currently ~3200 vendors worldwide who accept Bitcoin. (and those are just the ones aware of this website, I'm sure there are many more who accept them but do not know)   So, I think that the 170K is a very conservative estimate.  
Likewise, here's an r/bitcoin thread from a year ago that strongly supports there being *way* more than 170K, and that was one year ago. The market's exploded since then.
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:14:37
I think you're missing the point the OP was trying  make: Yes, there are a lot of people holding onto their Bitcoins as they become more and more expensive, but keep in mind most of these people are most likely just regular guys like me who got in early enough, but have plans to get out either entirely or in steps as they become incredibly that much more expensive.
I mean, right now, Bitcoins make up the largest single piece of my 'portfolio', and my plan is to sell once I get enough for a decent house.  I'm not just going to have hundreds of K's or millions but live an otherwise incredibly average lifestyle. I'm going to cash in.
TLDR; many/most most of the Bitcoin rich are rich in Bitcoins *only*, and have incredibly average assets and income - it will become way too tempting to just sit on them when they're worth 100's of K's or millions. I know I will be...

lol, what the hell, Bitcoin?? After literally waiting for weeks for the price to go up to buy plane tickets (have a wedding to go to in a few weeks) - yesterday at this time, I figured, "ok, the plane ticket prices keep going up, but Bitcoin's been basically flat or slightly falling for awhile now, guess I'll cash some in and buy that plane ticket"... and now - 24 hrs later - the price of BTC's are shooting up!
If this is what I have to do to make the price go up - ok fine, I guess. But, I can't afford to do that forever, Bitcoin! 
PS - went through cheapair.com - and I gotta say, the process was incredibly easy and *fast*.  They gave me a confirmation number literally within 30 seconds of me sending them the coins.  So, on that front, I was very pleased. I highly recommend them. (and, for some context, I'm Canadian.)
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:58:54


in all fairness, he's claiming that the recent drop was b/c of Russia 'not accepting it' (to what he's referring, I don't know) - and Apple's recent deletion of the Blockchain wallet app.  
I'm not necessarily agreeing w/ him, just kinda throwing him a bone.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:33:05
When travelling over international borders, aren't you hassled? ie- I'm sure they inevitably ask how you fund your nomadic lifestyle when they find out you're just travelling around.  Do you tell them you use Bitcoin? 
Likewise, assuming you keep key access on your cell phone, have they ever copied your entire phone? (this is not that uncommon) - and aren't you concerned about that? - particularly stealing your keys?
The reason I ask, is that just this past weekend I went to the US just on a whim, and the US Border security guy really gave me the 20 questions treatment (I had to go into secondary.) 
Anyway! Good luck! Keep us posted - you're living the dream, man! :)

@_date: 2014-07-28 17:43:22
This is basically a total conjecture-based answer, but given all the recent good news with Bitcoin, (Dell accepting it, for example) - why has the price been flat, and in the past few days - falling?
Or, on the same token, what will be the catalyst to create the next big move in price - like back to the 1000+ dollar range?
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:43:23


I do and I don't like that idea. I like it b/c of convenience, but at the same time, that's getting pretty centralized in nature, and would almost defeat the purpose of Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-06-08 04:50:44
sorry, perhaps I'm an idiot - I thought I understood mining and the implications of a 50% hashrate - how could going beyond fix anything? Isn't that a threat to the integrity of the entire Bitcoin protocol?
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:17:00
just curious - sorry if this obvious... but why does the difficulty go up, incessantly?  if you consider that the price has been down/falling for months, and mining becomes less profitable, shouldn't the difficulty go down, even a little bit? or is it simply b/c there's been continual growth in the number of miners/hashrate?

 *annnnnnd* Discussion. Over.  A Ponzie Scheme?  That's the lamest and weakest and most bloody ignorant line that the haters use.  Sigh. 
Seriously, I thought I was having at least a semi-serious discussion w/ a doubter, but the Ponzi Scheme line is just so utterly debunked, it's not even worth getting into in any great detail.
Understand what a [Ponzi Scheme]( actually is: "A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from existing capital or new capital paid by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation."
You're either lazy or ignorant, b/c that is **NOT** how the Bitcoin model works. Your claim is bad, and you should feel bad. There is no centralized authority that automatically profits from every single new Bitcoin user.  Likewise, new users do not pay existing users.  And thus, that NYT article is just trash, since they do not even understand the fundamentals.   
If you're just going to troll, run along.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but even if it is above 50%, there's really no incentive for a mining pool to start doing the dastardly deeds that they're pottentially capable of doing giving how the word would get out pretty quickly, which would essentially destroy faith in Bitcoin (and particularly scare off new investors), and thusly destroying the value.  
It would have to be one hell of a conspiracy for the likes of Ghash to be taken over by a group looking to destroy Bitcoin. (and don't get me wrong, I know they exist - cough, banks, cough, federal gov't.)

Yup, and I, and millions like me wouldn't have it *any other way.*:  No centralized owner. No central bank. No central controller of any kind. Love it.

I'd rather a fingerprint scanner vs. a cell phone number collection. I mean, it's incredibly easy to tie a cell phone w/ a person, but insofar as the lack of any nationally enforced/mandatory database of fingerprints being basically non-existent (short of criminals), it's practically impossible to tie a fingerprint w/ just anyone.

this is what I do: (as a relative non-techy)
I use Multibit, exported my key to a thumbdrive (made MANY backups), then deleted that key and all associated files off my computer, so it's essentially in cold storage.  
It seems pretty bullet proof to me, and I welcome anyone to let me know of any security issues. (obviously when I go to spend them, I have to be concerned about keyloggers, but in the meantime, unless sometime steals those drives and is able to crack the password, my coins are 100% safe*.)

Ghash.IO's hashrate is now at 41% (and falling) - from a high of 47% just a couple of hours ago
The market is already adapting.
Likewise, a 51% attack would not necessarily mean the inevitable end for Bitcoin, anyway
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:34:32


Yep, there are a tiny amount who own a large portion of the BTC's in circulation, no argument there. But as for your 2nd point - as this point, the only really viable way that the price could be drastically affected by a certain pocket of users is via [mining pools]( There was concern recently that Ghash.IO was garnering the majority of the market. (it was as high as 41%, maybe more, at one point.) Anyway, the market reacted - knowing that for the bigger picture, this would be bad as it would be *like* centralized control. So, within a couple of days of the news, enough people got out of the mining pool, and it's currently at 29%.  


It's absolutely true, though.  Assuming your estimation is right (which, I'm willing to bet it's not given my citations later on) - there's absolutely a *lot* of room to grow which supports the idea that it might be a good idea to get in now if you haven't already.


You should look at my citations from the r/bitcoin thread I cited that's approximately a year old. It shows numbers to be much higher than that. (and that was then, as we both agree, the number of users have exploded since then.)


It's not that simple though, b/c it can't count how many wallets were created offline, and being kept in cold storage.  
Also, did you see how there's a wide range of numbers there? Keep in mind those are the addresses being "used". In other words, when a wallet is being used for storage/savings and not for regular transactions, it would drop from the count.  That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, just that it's not being used - that doesn't mean that person is no longer a possessor of Bitcoin, just that they're a saver.  (myself included.)

This isn't quite what you're asking, but it may give you an idea:
"How does TREZOR keep my bitcoins safe if I connect it to a compromised computer?"
"The private keys never leave the device and the malware cannot read the private keys from TREZOR. This is thanks to the wire protocol between TREZOR and the computer, which does only transfer unsigned transactions to the device and signed ones out of the device. Also, we have implemented a safe way of entering PIN, so no keylogger can be used to spy on your PIN."

It's a possibility - yep.
Thing is, it was what - just 2-3 nights ago, and they only had a 25-30% share? and now it's 50%?  It's pretty crazy it can change so much, so quickly.

Well, predicting the price by ~7% 3 *weeks* out is fairly impressive, I think.  I mean, I don't think the average user could do that - or even a so-called Bitcoin expert.

oh, I thought it was like half a one... yeah, that ain't cheap.
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:36:12
They are different, though - the average rich person has millions in assets (not just cash, but boats, houses, cars, artwork, precious metals, investments, etc.). Meanwhile, rich Bitcoiners are largely (particularly the early adopters) just regular guys who are otherwise not rich at all, but took a chance.
I'm not saying they're any more or less moral, I'm just saying that given how rich they are in Bitcoin, they're not just going to sit on millions in them indefinitely when they have no other significant assets, they're going to actually cash them out so they can actually *enjoy* being rich.
I'm making generalizations of course - some will just hold on, and allow greed to take over, but I don't think I speak for myself when I say that I have a goal, here - and once I hit it, I'm going to cash out (meanwhile, cashing in here and there in bits and pieces as it continues to rise.)

wait, it can't just import my key like Multibit did? I have to send it to a special Trezor-made wallet? hmm... sounds a bit centralized-ish.
I mean, I thought these apps were designed to read *any* key regardless of where they were first generated. (mine was originally a wallet from a self-installed client, forget the name, then I moved it to a blockchain.info wallet, and finally I sent those to an address I generated in Multibit.  But, it's been my impression that I can take that key file and import it anywhere.)
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:32:10

Yes, thanks - that's what I'm looking for, actually. I'd already considered those scenarios.  So far, so good.  (I moved them back in Dec of last year - and I have a link to the address saved on blockchain.info, so I check that just about daily to make sure no changes have occured. I'd think that ~6 months later they'd have been cleaned out by now if I were compromised. There are 10's of thousands in dollars there.)

"**You are at the behest and mercy of others when it comes to your money**, but it seems you’re so accustomed to this serfdom that a liberating technology like Bitcoin comes along and you squint from behind your Stockholm-syndrome shackles and yell, “Ponzi Scheme because volatility!” "
Fucking *snap*. Exactly.
It's not even a debate - I mean - yes, Bitcoin's **very** volatile, but it does **not** fit the description of a Ponzi Scheme, at all. The big fundamental difference being that unlike an actual Ponzi Scheme, when you 'invest' (buy Bitcoins), you are not paying someone up the line in some kind of hierarchy -- it's completely decentralized.  You simply buy them, hold/sell/whatever.  There is no financial totem pole. 
Anyways, people like North are smart enough to know this, so I don't know if he's just a technophobe or what.  But FFS is it ever frustrating to see otherwise very intelligent people spew such garbage.

the Ferrari in the pic from 2009, is neither of those in the OP's pic (this is based on the front bumper/intake, the rims - are totally different - and possible the air intake above the door. Hard to say, but the 09 one looks much smaller.) 
Now, it's easy enough to change your rims, but they're Ferraris - that's not typically things people do on such high-end cars. Likewise w/ the bumper. This is not a Honda Civic - they are not pimped up, as a rule. 
I am not saying *for sure* - b/c the angles are so different, but the rims and bumper are definitely different.  
edit: I'm thinking that maybe you weren't saying the cars were the same - but that he's always had Ferrari-level money, anyway.... likewise, the pic from 09 is definitely a different Ferrari - I just noticed the side view mirror support pillar - and again, looking at the air scoupe by the door - they're different.

?? You should reread what I said - likewise, surf back through r/bitcoin to about 3-4 weeks ago when the scare was on regarding mining pools and how if that one mining pool was close to garnering 51% and why this majority control would be dangerous.
You're clearly not following Bitcoin that much. I'm not an expert by any stretch, but the fact that the Mt. Gox affected the price by 10% is absolutely laughable. The price is wildly variable and a 10% change up or down, within an hour's time is not outside the norm insofar as Bitcoin is concerned. Sure, for a conventional currency/commodity that would be *huge* but that kind of movement is nothing new in the Bitcoin world. And that's a red-herring anyway, since the issue was a tiny group being able to directly *control* the price. Mt. Gox was **not** a cohesive group of people by any stretch.  


I'm sorry, I actually have evidence and history on my side. So, you can say I'm making shit up, but I've only based my views on things that have actually happened. Honestly, I keep saying this, w/ total sincereity - you must be *very* new, b/c as mentioned even the casual Bitcoin user has know for *months* now that the Mt. Gox exchange was/is a *horrible* choice in the world of exchanges. I didn't say **all** exchanges, just that one.  That's just a strawman attack to claim that I did.


Irrelevant data? What the? Are you honestly comparing an incredibly **tiny** niché market of pets to a paradigm shifting currency/commodity? It's not even in the same city, let alone ballpark.  Irrefutably there **is** a lot of room to grow by the mere fact that even if there were 2-3 million regular users of Bitcoin that's still an incredibly small market share.  Imagine for a moment if Bitcoin was as popular and utilized as Paypal or E-bay. Clearly the market cap would be several times higher. So yes, there *is* a lot of room to grow.


Yes, and interest translates into users.  There's a reason why the number of vendors who accept Bitcoin has officially (unofficially probably a lot more) increased over [350%]( in 3 months. Mere interest doesn't drive vendors to take the time and effort to learn how to accept them; they don't take the time to learn how to properly accept them if people aren't actually using them. 
There's frankly no way to determine the 'true' number of 'regular' users, b/c that's honestly pretty subjective. (how often would you have to be considered a user, coupled w/ how much would you have to spend?) Either way, to suggest this is some fad like a unique breed of parrots is just utterly ridiculous.

gold is currently still very much a valuable (and used) commodity item, nowadays...
And, frankly - it's about the safest guarantee in terms of withholding *some* value.  Bitcoin on the other hand.... while it's outlook is good, it doesn't have the "intrinsic" value of gold. It could go to zero in value, whereas gold won't.  (I mean, I'd practically bet my life that Bitcoin won't go to zero, but it's possible.)
I use quotes b/c all value is subjective, and even gold would be worth no more than a bag of dirt given the correct circumstances - but still, historically and currently, it's basically guaranteed to have *some* value. (and Bitcoin, or at least - the Blockchain is starting to look "intrinsically" valuable, too.)

Most here sound pretty well-versed on this whole Bitcoin XT issue - including yourself.  Could you ELI5 (or maybe 10, or 12) - what the implications of this fork, are?
If I understand it correctly, it's not another alt-coin - but if there's a fork, how can it not be? (ie- if people like me who garnered their Bitcoins using the original client - won't they now become obsolete/worthless if the majority go to XT?)

To build on what others have said - with Bitcoin, it's the closest thing to actually walking up to the artist and handing them a dollar bill.  As you know, with Bitcoin, there's no middleman - no approval process - no one who can freeze any funds (unlike Paypal or any CC company.)  It's as grassroots as one could get, in the digital world.

That's *if* you choose to go through them - you can always just send to their address, directly.  (yes, I realize w/ this Louis CK example, he didn't just post his address - but that was his choice.)
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:36:49
sounds good..... so I suppose it just means that anyone who is running the XT client won't be obviously verifying any transactions on the conventional network, and vice versa?  So, I guess each network is technically less secure than the sum of their parts? (but in reality, each is still going to be ridiculously secure.)

B/c there a *number* of professional economists who said exactly that (I remember reading them back in '13, and saw links posted about them this summer.)

That's fair enough - I can accept that I was perhaps jumping the gun on that guy.
That said - this is the type of numbskullery I'm talking about (this guy isn't an economist as far as I can tell, but he's no slouch, either: a published author, and a senior writer for the International Business Times.)

Well, BTC's 'broken', (with its high fees and slow trans times) - so BCH is simply fixing that.  (ie- BCH is *now* acting like how BTC was *supposed* to be at this point)

Fair enough, good point.

see for yourself:
over 181 coins as of my writing this....
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:53:15
and don't forget faster and cheaper transactions.
edit: lol, downvoted for stating facts - damn, I was warned this place was a hardcore fanboy club.
edit2:  yes, there are other crypto's that work as good, if not better than BCH. I'm not here to shill for that, or any particular coin, really. BTC's great - BCH is great - they have their weaknesses, too. Still, I say, let the market decide. I'm not interested in a fervent debate, particularly b/w BTC and it's little cousin.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:40:22
um yeah, BCH's growing *much* faster than Dogecoin ever was...
but I know, I'm talking about the red-headed step child in a positive light, so I'll be downvoted into oblivion. Meh. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:44:40
ok, yes, I suppose there's a point to be made for 'preying on the weak', but I mean, buying crypto shouldn't be for someone who can not immediately recognize the different names shouldn't be a thing, anyway.
(but yes, I know - there *will* be some rare scenario of Gramma Elsie hearing "about all that bitcoin internet stuff", so she thought she'd buy it...and then ends up getting BCH, instead.  There will *always* be a tiny percentage of ignorant types no matter what - but I don't think that means there was intentional dishonesty. And, hell - if there is by Ver, I'd love to see it. Perhaps he e-mailed or someone audio recorded him talking about he purposely wants to deceive people.)
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:22:18
I don't know if you're purposely lying or ignorant.
You're conflating *block confirmation* times with *transaction* times.  Again, I've literally personally experienced personal **transaction** times of seconds with BCH.  Sure, there was a time last December when it was taking hours - but again, this is a seperate issue from block confirmation times.
Again, BTC block times are also 10 minutes, but as you know, transaction times were literally hours, if not over a day at its worst.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:45:47
I tend to agree w/ that one.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:38:50


Yes, thank you for that, Pedantic Peter. But 3 or more? That's a different story - that's why I used the *colloquial* basis for confirmation times. (Again, it's about 14 mins now for BTC.)


LOL! um ok, and do what with it?  Show it off to the other BTC fanboys? Alright, dude. But, I have suggestion - you're taking things just a *bit* too seriously, I think. Whew.
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:54:26
Man. Thank *you*. All this fanboy nonsense is just so bloody childish, lame and tedious.  
@_date: 2015-11-06 17:15:09
yeah, there's something like 3 cuts of the film.... theatrical, director's, special edition... it's kinda confusing:
 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:42:07
I'm sorry, but if you don't take 12 seconds to see/read the difference between Bitcoin *Core* and Bitcoin *Cash* - then you're simply not ready to buy either. It's literally right there - in black and white.
Yes, for the gramma who has literally never heard of either, I can see some of them being confused, but again, for the average even half-tech-savvy user, this should not be an issue.  
And yes, I know, I'll buried to hell w/ this comment but, whatever.  
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:41:03
it was cut out of the the theatrical version, FYI
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:55:42
BTC average fee: ($2.78)
and, average time:
latest - 14 mins  (but it was just 88 mins 2 days ago)
BCH average fee: ($0.07)
and, average time:
(not available - but block times are also 10 mins ish)
But anecdotally, in the times I've used it (last fall) and more recently, talking with other BCH users it's literally seconds - certainly *never* minutes. I've used BTC several times a year since '13, and my best times have been like 15 mins. BCH? typically under 30 seconds.
So yes, it's both faster **and** cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:34:45
and has about 1/1000th the respect, recognition and market utilization.

no, it's from T2 (I mean for one, look at how young Arnold looks)
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:58:41
I mean, you keep saying that - but where's your evidence? You don't even have anecdotal evidence or experience.  
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:41:33
No. I asked **you** for evidence of typically slower BCH transaction times - you haven't provided any evidence.  
@_date: 2016-05-25 21:36:26
no kidding - the latest interface for Multibit is worlds apart from the old one - and for the life of me, I can't figure out how to import my key into it, so I went back to the old version.
If I understand it correctly, Multibit has disabled the ability to export keys to a thumb drive (but from what I can see, you can't even import them off your HDD)
perhaps could clarify - b/c I'd really like to go w/ the latest version, but obviously I can't if I can't actually spend any of my BTC's....  (I'm thinking I'll have to use another client, import the coins to there and *then* send them over to my Multibit HD wallet?)

Well, in my completely unprofessional/laymen's opinion is that as the OP mentioned, the Google and Facebook equivalents coming out for Bitcoin will have have nothing to do w/ a search engine or a social network, but of a *user friendly* interface for buying/selling them. (ex. As easy as e-mail so that your grandma will be using it regularly.)

HD only? I thought this was just some marketing ploy - I mean, even Crest is calling some of their mouthwash, 'HD'.  Forgive my ignorance, I guess you guys are actually meaning something technically significant, here?
Thanks for the link. I should actually go through that instead of jumping in head first thinking I'll figure it out.  Cheers.

so not Bitcoin, then...? I know you're probably not suggesting that, just saying that in response to the previous poster's point.
(that said, I do have some so-called 'real' assets along with Bitcoin. I intend to hold onto both - diversification is good, I think.)

Also - who's gonna pay 3-4 dollars (or is the avg. transaction fee higher now?) for like 15-20 dollar meal?

I don't disagree that most jumping on board right now are speculating - but as more speculators get in, so does the average joe... which helps to raise (but also stabilize) the price.
Sure, it could crash to 40, 20, 3 bucks in a day or two - but given it's ever-increasing utility, I think it's a relatively safe risk.  Time will tell....
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:22:57

Hi, thanks for doing this.  A couple of things:
1.  Do you buy Bitcoins from Canadians? If so, how so, and is there verification required insofar as ID is concerned?
2.  Do you accept PC Financial debit cards (I assume not, b/c they are owned by CIBC, and you do not accept them if I understand correctly.)
@_date: 2013-06-09 14:47:46
on a related note, I don't think bitcoinstore.com is going to make their quota in order to stay in business :(
They're currently only at 39% (and the clock started at the beginning of May) - at this rate, BTC's  will have to more than double at the current price of $95 for it to stay viable. (or, they'll need more than twice the influx of new buyers.)
edit: they will stay in business, but they'll just have to raise their prices accordingly. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:48:25

not to be too pedantic, but you could, but it would never be accepted into the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:13:21
hmm, I thought I understand the nature of the blockchain, but if random links can be placed inside of it - what does that say about the security? And what about the potential for it being littered w/ such huge amounts of data that it may become an even bigger hassle to download?
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:19:55


I agree, you can't fight the market, completely. But let's be honest, we dont' want this going underground when it's just barely off the ground, already. In an ideal world, we'd have it legal, making it *much* easier to buy and sell (not to mention to have acceptance) than if it were illegal and you had to go to equivalent of an online crack dealer to get it. (yeah, like Silk Road - it was actually quite functional and relatively legit, but it was never going to gain mass acceptance.)
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:16:32

dude are you for real? - you're actually literally ok w/ cops coming up and threatening/scaring *children* who are raising money for a *Sick Children's Hospital* all to appease you and your permits??  I mean, besides that fact, do you really and honestly think that kids selling lemonade is a national health threat? 
Wow. I know I said before I shouldn't waste any more time conversing w/ you, (b/c I even like to give troll-like behaviour the benefit of the doubt) but anyone who supports threatening children (who are fundraising for a hospital, no less) w/ fucking cops are sick individuals.

But, the mining reward is not only *not* modest, but it looks **downright terrible**:
I mean, these are losses of like 5, 6, 800%? I mean, I'm no expert, and unless I'm missing a very large part of the picture (which is possible), the margins *already* seem horribly below anything you could consider even remotely modest.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:16:11
Man, in just 4 minutes, even! Well done, sir! You're a great rep for Bitcoin! You definitely did a good job simply explaining it to the masses.  
(ps - did you ever find out what "breaking news" made her cut the interview short? and were you bothered by essentially getting bumped?)
@_date: 2013-02-21 18:21:37
 lol... but it's not worth the 90 seconds it would take me to do that. B/c from my calculations it would garner all of about 6 cents at today's prices. (I know you weren't saying I *should* - jus' sayin' is all.)
But, that said, I was pleased to get a nice tip from blockchain.info for simply retweeting them - took all of &lt;1 second, and I got like 0.02 BTC's or about 60 cents.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:03:06
b/c it's (somehow) still the world's 'go-to' currency...
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:41:33
I'm running Multibit, and I have multiple backups of my private key on several flash drives. I then deleted that wallet from Multibit, so that even if it was compromised, there's no wallet.dat file to be found. I'm about as safe as I can be then? (short of going to cold-storage, which, if I understand right actually 'removes' the BTC's off of the network altogether?)
edit: ah, I just watched the video re: creating a paper wallet.  It's not really accurate to say your BTC's are being removed from the network, as the key simple enables you to unlock whatever BTC's are coupled w/ that key (ie- you can create the wallet offline, and simply send keys to that address online, and they'll be there - w/o having to put your private key online)
@_date: 2013-02-17 06:36:45
I wonder how that compares to blockchain.info
I just deleted my computer-installed BTC client, and went to that. I couldn't be happier.
And, if you retweet them, they'll give you (a fraction) of a BTC. They gave me 0.02 - hey 54 cents is 54 cents.

@_date: 2013-03-12 02:48:58
and wait less than a few more days, and it's safe to bet they'll be even higher than just before the drop... that's the nature of Bitcoins for the foreseeable future; they are going to be incredibly volatile. Tonight is no surprise or any cause for concern.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:46:47
hmmm, but typical cold-storage removes the keys from the blockchain altogether? whereas a backup just copies them elsewhere?
ok, actually, it just occured to me to back up my wallet (on multiple flash drives, complete w/ passwords) and then navigate to the wallet within the Multibit folder, delete that - and then only upload my wallet back into Multibit whenever I need to make a transaction.  While not as good as cold-storage, (you're still trusting the integrity of the network itself) I'd say it's the next best thing?
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:02:58


yeah, absolutely, that's why I  have the wallet saved to multiple storage devices, and keep nothing on my computer other than Multibit, itself.
But yeah, you should check out Multibit, it's just like the self-installed Bitcoin client, except you don't have to download the entire ledger, you just update from servers that do.
@_date: 2013-05-28 14:39:25

Ha, yes - indeed.  Not bad - actually for me though, I did move all of these coins from a blockchain.info so, I go still log in there to check the amount forwarded, b/c it still (in real time) adjusts the dollar value.

Well, that's a fundamental change, isn't it? I mean, demand is higher, and the market is bigger than ever before. It's not like the number of users and awareness is exactly the same now as it was when it ballooned to 260 back this spring?
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:10:11
Question: Why would I use the Qt-client when I could just use Multibit, and not have to wait for the agonizingly long sync time w/ the network? 
(I heard that the Qt-client is 'more secure', but how is that so? For me, I have deleted my wallet off of my system after I backed up my BTC's onto multiple flash drives, so I don't see how doing the same on the Qt-client would be any safer.)
edit: thanks folks, I understand now. (for anyone else, in short, the 'thin' clients like Multibit rely on another server to download the blockchain first - so you have to trust that they're legit.)
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:29:38

congrats man... btw, what country are you in?
I'm in Canada, and my plan is to cash out and use them for a downpayment on a house, but, like you I'm afraid about paying the oppressive income taxes. And while it's tempting to do that under the table, I think it'd be basically impossible to cash out such a huge amount and then turn around and put a huge downpayment on a house...
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:41:21
yeah, ok true - but I guess I was thinking that you could have a number of smaller wallets for day-to-day stuff, and send your BTC's to your offline/paper wallet.
Also, I'm not 100% clear on BTC security, so just to clarify:
When you have an 'offline' wallet, your BTC's are not actually offline, just the key. Of course to get them, you'd have to crack the key, and that's basically impossible, at this point. 
I have my own method for taking my BTC's 'offline'.  I use a self-installed client, and I back up the wallet on multiple thumb drives, as well as burning it to a CD.  Then, I go back to my client, I delete the wallet file, effectively taking it offline.  AFAIK, this is effectively the same as a paper wallet, I just have it saved in a digital format.
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:03:17
hmmm... not sure if serious... or....
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:12:45

Interesting, and this all applies to Canadian law? 


Fair enough, b/c that's assuming (in the historical/traditional sense) that when you do buy something, you've *already* paid income tax on that money, right? But, if I paid $1,000 for x number of Bitcoins awhile ago, and they're now worth $100,000 - if I straight up trade/barter those coins to attain a house, you're saying that I never have to pay income tax on the $99,000 profit?  (and, that said, how they could tax me anyway, b/c there's no evidence/receipt of how much I paid for the coins in the first place, right?)
So, what I take from this is - to avoid any taxes, I need to barter/trade to get my house and/or car directly, and *not* cash out, first? Man, something seems too good to be true.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:39:09
Thanks - I understand now.
Hmmm, perhaps I should go back to Bitcoin Qt, then. (I had it in Feb/March - and when I originally installed it, it took like 7-8 hrs to sync. I can just imagine how much longer it will take now.)
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:31:11
Thanks Jamie.
Yeah, I have a good number of them and with the recent price increase, I may be selling soon for CDN dollars.  Right now I'm looking at  - they sell up to 25 at a time (but that's not my main concern, really.) Are you guys able to be competitive w/ their sell offer? Right now it's about $157.
@_date: 2013-08-28 17:48:48
You look like you know your stuff, so I have a very easy/noob question:
Where exactly do these transaction fees go? Who is profiting?
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:58:44
It's very critical, and I don't doubt that's inevitable... until the federal gov't makes them illegal. It will scare off all of the legit big commercial vendors (Amazon, et al.) 
I mean, let's be honest, virtual currency (not necessarily Bitcoin) will offer serious competition to the USD, and the federal gov't is not just going to sit by and do nothing. They'll do the only thing they know: Demonize, fearmonger and make BTC's illegal. (not that it'll kill them altogether, it will just at least somewhat de-legitimize them among the average Joe and certainly among the aforementioned big retailers.)
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:37:05
Alright well that's good to hear, b/c if people stop mining them, while it may rise the price in the short term, it wouldn't do anything for longterm viability.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:14:36


hmm, sorry...what exactly do you mean by that last part? Besides forgetting my blockchain password and/or key, how else would I be screwed by using them (besides the reasons you've already mentioned.)


I started out w/ Bitcoin Qt, but then after reading all the horror stories about how if your HDD crashes, your BTC's are gone forever I put my wallet on Blockchain b/c it was so easy and seems safe. The whole cold-storage thing just seems a bit overwhelming to do. So what if I went back to a software-installed client and regularly backed-up my wallet onto (several) USB drives, wouldn't that be as good as storing them offline? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:07:10


Yeah, for sure - hence why I threw some quotes around it. All value is subjective, in reality - but at least something like gold, has actual, physical utility and can be used to actually build something *else* of value. (ex, in manufacturing electronics). 
Likewise, Bitcoin is almost perfect in its execution as you noted, but there's still a chance it could go to zero, whereas gold has historic precedence as being the 'last resort' money, and chances are, it will *always* have *some* value. (and sure, that *could* go to zero, too - but then we'd be having much more serious and looming problems on our hand, like a total and absolute breakdown of society where people are eating their neighbours just to survive.)  
Unfortunately, Bitcoin could be regulated to death, making any kind of mass-adoption essentially impossible.  (but having said that, if government itself breaks down, then, sure it could naturally be the world replacement currency.)
...so much speculating...
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:40:13
ah, my ignorance has been slightly decreased as of this moment. kudos.
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:23:39
I'm wondering what you or others think about my unusual/sloppy(?) way of storing my coins 'offline'. (I honestly am not even sure if you can classify them as being stored offline.)
Anyway, here's how I do it:
I downloaded Multibit, and backed up all of my coins to several thumbdrives and a burned CD. Then, I deleted the original wallet file from my computer, so now when I open it up, they don't exist there, and only on my external hardware.  So, as far as a hacker is concerned, all they can see on my computer is Multibit, but no actual key/wallet files of any kind. I should be good, right? (assuming those external methods don't fail.)
So, 2 things: 
1. Is that like a form of cold storage?
2. Is that not just as safe as conventional cold storages via Armory et al?
@_date: 2013-03-11 18:08:00

@_date: 2013-03-22 11:59:03
OK, so do I need to backup my wallet every few hours to keep it updated w/ the network, or do I only need to make backups after every transaction?


Ah, very interesting. I'm going to check that out, b/c I just DL'ed that last night. According to bitcoin.org Multibit doesn't have to download the entirety of the transactions like Qt does, but it's not quite as secure? Do you know how?
And I notice Blockchain.info is down right now, so I can just take my backed-up wallet into Multibit and I'll again have full access to my BTC's? Is it a simple, like, "File - Import Wallet"? (I'm at work now, so I can't check it out.)
Also, one last thing, are there any issues to running both a web-based and software-installed wallet?
@_date: 2013-05-19 05:22:28

He may be a brilliant person in other regards, but quite evidently he is *not* very bright when it comes to Bitcoin (and definitely compared to the majority I've talked to on here.)
I mean, c'mon, he doesn't even understand the fundamentals: That it's literally impossible for gov't to completely stop the transfer of Bitcoins since it's decentralized by its very nature, or that BTC's themselves can be sub-divided to 8 decimal places.  


I don't think it is - can you be more specific?
Sure, gov't could make them illegal, but like w/ pot it definitely won't stop the trade of it, and will most likely just increase the price of it. It's futile and laughable to think that gov't can simply end trade with something that has a completely decentralized architecture/infrastructure.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:39:16
yip, that's why I think if you have the client installed on your computer, back-up the keys to multiple external HD's or flashdrives and then delete the original key off your computer so that when you run it, it shows a 0 balance. That way, even if your computer is compromised, there's no wallet to be found... 
It's the next best thing to cold-storage. (And I trust the network's integrity itself, so I don't think cold storage is necessary at this point.)
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:52:49

But I mean, I can't really blame you. I mean, look at these **monsters**:
"A cranky, unidentified woman in an Oshawa neighbourhood called 911 and sicked police on a 9-year-old autistic boy in a bid to shut down his booming lemonade stand Monday.
Worse yet, the officer called to the scene asked the boy’s family to stop the fundraiser for SickKids hospital because the boy didn’t have a vendor’s permit to sling the juice."
Using lemonade funds to raise money for a *sick children's hospital*?? Whether it happens in just one city or 100, the point is: **They must be shut down amirite?!?!**
Then again, maybe you're just hung up on the fact that it's not literally happening on the millions of every street corner in the US, so, it's no big deal?

Yeah, I noticed it requires Java to run. (which has had issues w/ security, IIRC) - so I'm a tad leery about that. 


Yeah, I definitely don't - other than the very rare time I like to see my 'official' balance. Frivelous? Absolutely. Ego-boosting? Definitely.


Yeah, AFAIK, it's just under the Multibit folder in the App Data/Roaming section - as I said, I always delete that immediately after I do an occasional check.  
Thanks yeah, I've heard that your files aren't actually deleted right away.  


Yeah, I went to  and upped the characters in my wallet password so that the 'average' desktop computer would take over 1 nonillion years to crack (I think it had 32 zeros after it?), up from a measly 6 years. 
That all said, I think my greatest threat would be if I were keylogged for the few minutes I took to import/export/create a new password. I am kinda paranoid w/ my wallet (since I've never had this much money in my life), so it's possible, but I feel pretty safe (for now.)
Thanks again for all the help. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:27:36
Man, ignorance really *is* bliss... I'm *glad* I didn't hear about them until about a year ago, and not when they were under a penny, b/c I probably would have turned up my nose at the time.
That said, when I finally did hear about them, they were around 12-13 each, but I waffled, and finally got on board when they were about 20... so yeah, I'm *slightly* feeling your pain, but not really. Sorry, I'm not really helping, am I?
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:31:47


Bubbles don't recover, not only do that not recover, they don't *create new consistent record highs.*  So, no, Bitcoin wasn't in a bubble then, and there's not much evidence to show it's in one now.


That's a tad hyperbolic, it's closer to 2.5x's or so...


China is the game-changer, here. They now have the largest exchange over there by volume, and popularity of it in general is much stronger than ever before. Likewise, SR wasn't its biggest 'customer' of Bitcoin b/c not only has the price recovered since then, it's gone on to create several new record highs.


With volume and total users and businesses using and accepting it more and more every day, there's just no real evidence for the bubble theory. Just b/c something grows exponentially in price in spurts does not make it a bubble.


heh, um, no- they can't. They may *possess* the keys but the last I heard, they can not *unlock* them. Likewise, even if they could, you're **really** going to have to do your homework to prove to us how that release of Bitcoins would crash the market.  But, I'll save you time, it won't work out. For that to happen, their SR stash would have to equate to at least half the BTC's out there, and they're nowhere near that.
edit: here's a video explaining how this incredible growth and volatility is normal.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:55:52


Do you also use Multibit?


lol, no shit. Me too. My heart was racing, and I start feeling light-headed. Scary shit. B/c it wasn't even change... I only had to pay like 2.5% of coins to get back my principle, but the other 97.5% in "change" was automatically moved.  I don't see the point of it, other than to give users a temporary heart attack. B/c addresses are a public thing, so there's no security risk in someone else knowing ours (obviously you want people to, if you want them to send you coins). I'm obviously missing something, here.
@_date: 2013-11-01 06:14:44
I don't understand why people would buy miners anymore. I mean, unless you're **incredibly** rich and love eccentric/expensive hobbies like this...
Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful people are into mining, but man - what a waste of money.  I don't follow the trends daily, but the difficulty is increasing at an exponential rate, AFAIK, and it's something like 800% in operating costs.  
@_date: 2013-08-28 18:27:35
Gotcha, thanks.
So the mining fee is put back into the 'pool' and divided up among the current miners, then?
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:15:17


Well trading in China has increased significantly in a very short time. They now have the largest exchange in the world (by volume.)
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:46:47
This is a good explanation, thanks.  One question though:


Why are you doing that? As soon as you generate the offline public/private keys, you can automatically transfer coins to said address w/o ever putting the wallet tied to it online, correct?
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:21:28
probably b/c he thinks the price will be rising quickly in the short-term?
(but yeah, you're right, this would be much safer)
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:40:06
hmm yeah, well I have the key itself protected w/ a password, so even if someone else got it, they'd have a hell of a time trying to crack it.
Is that not the same way as an offline wallet? I mean, I didn't print out the key to a paper wallet, but I simply have it uploaded to an external source that is *always* offline.  And additionally, do paper  wallets even have any kind of password protection, or are they simply just QR codes that can be scanned and immediately accessed?
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:22:02


Perfectly said, so succinct and to the point. (and so applicable to so many of the ignorant haters)
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:44:04

@_date: 2013-11-07 07:13:45
Ok, so I'm using Multibit, and this is my version of 'cold storage'
I simply choose the export key option, and save it to an offline device (USB thumb drive, well several) - and then in the option where it asks to use a password, I added my own password. But, later I exported it with another much longer password (just to minimize any chances of brute forcing actually working).  I then go back and delete all associated files from Multibit that it automatically saves onto your harddrive, which, I assume destroys any evidence I actually had any keys in my wallet in the first place.
(I realize that if I were being keylogged while this was going down, it would be all for naught.  But what are the odds?)
So, 2 questions:
1. is it really a cold-storage method? How effective would you rate it? I mean so long as I keep those thumb drives offline, it doesn't really get any better than that, right? I realize it's not as safe as a conventional cold wallet, but - it's still far superior to just keeping it in blockchain.info or on my own self-installed, client, yes?
2.  I'm able to access the wallet w/ either of the original passwords I added, so long as I attempt to decrypt each one w/ it's originally associated password?
@_date: 2013-10-20 22:04:12
great, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:01:16


Oh? I'm really not familiar w/ either - could you explain for us ignorant folk?
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:38:07
Oh wow, Namecoin sounds like a *very* savvy concept. What a great idea. So I guess the incentive isn't for profit, but for privacy.  So, is the data for website still hosted/saved on the original servers, but just the keys are kept in the blockchain?
Hmm yeah, if Bitcoin can upgrade to use the Zerocoin protocol - what's the point of moving to Zerocoin in the first place?
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:13:52
Yeah, thanks, gotcha. I think I get it now.
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:16:41
ah, I see. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:36:17
well, there's been at least 2 major 'bubbles' before, but they aren't really bubbles though, b/c not only did the price recover each time, it went on to set new record highs...
it's going to be very volatile until the market increases in volume to a significant amount. (what that amount is, I can't tell you, I'm not a mathematician, but compared to other currencies, it's just still incredibly volatile given the very low number of people trading in it.)
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:32:31
Unfortunately, you're right. 
The recent price explosion is making me very nervous. Bitcoin's foundational stability is about as secure as a wet sand castle at the beach. It's easy to build up, but there's really nothing solid supporting it, at all. 
For all of us saving, we can hope that 100+ is the new normal (assuming you bought way below that.) And, really, as more speculators come on board it can only mean more spenders, will too. Sure, the ratio will always be more in favour of the speculators, but, even w/ time that should peter out some, and its base will become that much more solid.
...or, a huge flaw will be found in the network, all the BTC's compromised, and we'll be left w/ nothing but a bunch of digital magic beans. Either way, it's going to be one hell of a ride! :)

Oh it's built on *something*. That's why I said it's foundational stability is weak, not non-existent.

@_date: 2013-04-03 21:42:20

Thanks, yeah - I've never had anywhere near this much money (10's of thousands of dollars) in my life. It's pretty scary and exciting at the same time.

100K in a few years? or 10, even? Well, we're in uncharted territory w/ Bitcoins, but I really find that hard to believe. I hope I'm wrong though, b/c I do plan onto holding onto mine for at least another year or two, assuming the price continues to appreciate in value.

Well no, but it has incredible utility (decentralized, virtual instant exchange time, relatively anonymous, etc.)

Are there any issues/complications to using both a web-based (like my Blockchain account) along w/ a software wallet (like Bitcoin-Qt?). For me, I rarely ever move coins around; meaning that I don't buy/sell BTC's at all. I just bought a lump sum a month or so ago and plan to hold onto them for a few months/a year, and plan to cash out most of them on a new car.
And if I'm understanding this correctly, if Blockchain does go down, I can just load up the software wallet, and import the backed-up that I downloaded from Blockchain, and voila I'm in business again? 
OK, yeah, I can see that cold-storage option is probably the best idea as far as security goes, I'll check that out.
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:56:15
Wait, so the CRA uses the example of someone selling a movie, and how the **seller** is to be taxed on the value of the movie as income, but what about the buyer? (ie- 25 dollars additional to be added to his income, but no mention of the buyer?)
If I go out and buy a house w/ my Bitcoins, will I be taxed on that, too? (b/c that's my ultimate goal). Or is just the guy selling the house be taxed? (wait, primary house sales are never taxed as income anyway, right?)
edit: I re-read the article and I'm getting the impression that the buyer would be charged as capital gains if they cash out, but as income if they barter directly - but then the seller gets charged full income tax, too? (hmm, I guess so, that's how it works w/ conventional transactions, right? But, again w/ homes, you can not be charged income tax if it's your primary residence - likewise if you're buying a home, are you also charged income tax when you 'barter' since that's essentially cashing out?)  I mean, unless you're already a millionaire, there's no way guys like me will be able to afford the capital gains, let alone standard tax rates for buying a house w/ Bitcoin.

Hey, good for you, congratulations, and good on you for staying focused. (I mean, going for your PhD and by the sounds of it sitting on several million dollars in coins, yet you still are retaining your humble lifestyle.)
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:28:04
good question... was it strictly peer to peer?
@_date: 2013-03-25 03:41:24
Alright thanks...
So, what exactly is the difference b/w a key and a wallet? a key gives you access to your wallet? (which, really, for the sake of simplicity you could say were the same thing?)
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:40:14
I'll tell ya what I just said to someone else... b/c I'm in the same boat - my wallet protection 'paranoia' has increased as explosively as the price...
"yip, that's why I think if you have the client installed on your computer, back-up the keys to multiple external HD's or flashdrives and then delete the original key off your computer so that when you run it, it shows a 0 balance. That way, even if your computer is compromised, there's no wallet to be found...
It's the next best thing to cold-storage. (And I trust the network's integrity itself, so I don't think cold storage is necessary at this point.)"
@_date: 2013-02-21 14:24:35


Wait, this is a thing? Man. Someone make me an offer, I'm ready to sell out ASAP.
@_date: 2013-03-06 16:39:49
it's in the first paragraph: 


(unless they just ninja-edited their article - which I think could be the case, as it was last edited about 10 mins ago, and you said this around the same time.)
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:38:32
really? why would you just want to hold on to so many? I mean, unless it's purely for insurance, or maybe even collateral... I don't understand why someone would want to keep them and not actually exchange them for something tangible. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:09:50


I'm still relatively new to this myself, and I had a *ton* of questions at first. So don't ever feel silly for asking! :) I'm still learning and I feel still pretty wet behind the ears, but I'm pretty sure I understand what you're asking.
Anyways, (please, get verification from others, though) - I am 99.9% sure you have it correct.  It's my understanding that the .dat file has the key in it, and the key 'unlocks' your BTC's resting on the network. So yes, if you memorize your key, you should be good (hell, it's really long I believe...) And no, you shouldn't need your .DAT file - so long as you have your key backed up somewhere else (you can make any number of addresses link up to a key.)


As I said, I use MultiBit, and there's no option for a paper wallet in that, so I do the next best thing and I back up multiple copies of my key file via there.  I'm not 100% following your clean-boot question, but it sounds like you're talking about 'cold-storage'.  And yes, that's the the absolute safest method, as it actually removes the BTC's themselves from the network, AFAIK.
There's more info here re: cold-storage -  (it's supposedly the easiest way to do it, as it's typically a 10-12 step process)
Personally, I'm confident enough with keeping my coins on the network itself, as the security is some ridiculous 256-bit encryption that's basically impossible to crack w/ today's technology (there was a neat infographic about this floating around using a computer mainframe covering an entire star stating that's how powerful a computer you'd need to crack it. I think... ha...)
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:42:55
Ok, great, I did create a new address (vs just importing my wallet into Multibit.)
I only have to back up my wallet after a transaction? not on a regular basis, correct?  
Finally, is there was a easily get rid of the wallet.dat file on my computer? Just search for it and delete it? And how often is a new one created? Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:55:47
whew, you know what they say about hindsight though.....
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:36:24
I just do it w/ Multibit.
Ok, so it's maybe not 'cold-storage' in the traditional sense, but it's incredibly easy. I simply backed up my key onto (several) external devices (thumb drives, burned CD's), and then deleted all of my BTC-associated files from Multibit, and never run it.  
It takes all of 90 seconds or less, and I'm good. Sure, it's maybe not as 'safe' as traditional cold storage (as you have to log in to the network to do that), but once done, they are in effect in cold storage.

@_date: 2013-11-24 21:45:36
Yep, diversification is key... I have a lot of silver myself, and I've been tempted to dump it for BTC's over the last several months, but then I remembered the fundamental difference b/w the two:  Silver will *always* have *some* value, but Bitcoins could easily go to zero in a few days, or hours even... (I don't think it'll happen, but still...)
(and yes, I suppose silver can't be **guaranteed** to have at least some value, but look at history. And I mean, if it too went to zero, then we'd be having much more serious problems than worrying about money - ie- Apocalyptic, end-of-the-world level of worries - man eating man, etc. etc.)
So, that's why I don't sell my silver...
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:13:44
Man, it really puts a smile on my face hearing all the grassroots efforts by our fellow Bitcoiners who get out there and are spreading the word via grassroots efforts. Good on you, sir!
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:32:09


Whoa, **wow**, really??  That is dismal...
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:09:13
well don't be a dick about it.
@_date: 2013-05-28 14:09:34
yeah, wow... TIL.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:24:08
Great advice.
Just consider the money gone already, and you're really just playing a slightly more advanced form of lottery.
(although if it does go high enough, it may be best to cash out to replenish the initial amount you spent and then just leave the rest as gravy.)
However as many have pointed out, if we really want BTC's to catch on, we need to also spend, not just hoard, them.
@_date: 2013-04-30 15:08:19
Same goes for Multibit... no blockchain DL required, although I don't know if you can get it on a smartphone or not.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:09:17


yep, isn't it? Congratulations on the quadrupling of your Bitcoin savings. Enjoy. :)
@_date: 2013-03-25 03:12:22
lol, thanks for the backhanded compliment... ;)
Yeah, it seems almost too easy, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.


So, I guess you could just send coins back on forth all the time based on your comfort level and such? And is it possible to have the same wallet on the two mediums? Or do you simply have 2?
Finally, since I have to be concerned about my laptop crashing while on Multibit, as long as I backup my wallet on an external drive, I can simply reinstate them at a later date on a new system ?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:41:42
another quick one:


So I can't use that website to generate a paper wallet from an existing wallet on my computer? From what I can see, it just randomly creates an address and a corresponding private key - but I of course already have one within Multibit. 
Sorry if I'm missing something obvious, I'm still pretty new to this...
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:37:56
Excellent, thanks for the advice.
Is there anyway that I can tell Multibit to save my wallet/key to somewhere else besides the default place on my C: drive?
I do have them backed up w/ password protection, but there's always a wallet file in that default save - I'd just like to permanently have it saved to my external drive, is all.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:05:25
hmm, b/c they to are ignorant and afraid of something new, and thus, their defense mechanism is to denigrate it..?
@_date: 2013-11-02 06:12:16
Right on, man; love your passion. It's guys like you who are really helping to change minds and educate. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:32:04
Thanks - these guys actually have connections to the site I posted, b/c when I mentioned how impressive it was that they were answering e-mails at midnight, the guy replied, "I don't normally! Was dealing with the new SDICE unit release on  tonight :)"
I have no idea what an SDICE unit release is, but, from what I get out of that, the two aren't totally independent.  
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:30:21
oh, so there's most of your mortgage, settled...
Well, what's your plan? I only have about $11K or so right now, and while my wife is working, and I'm not for the time being, we have a baby on the way, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to cash out, but I really don't want to, b/c I'm sure in 6-12 months from now it could easily be worth 4, 5 or 10 times what it is, now...
when is your 'cash-in' point? Or have you even set one, yet? At least you aren't financially pressured for the time being...
edit: also, tipping random folks on reddit would make them happy...and it's a contagious feeling, man.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:31:24
Whew, that gave me goose bumps. I wonder where this guy is, today. So beautifully said.
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:19:27
So, if I understand this correctly, once you move your funds from your blockchain wallet into your Multibit wallet, then you are of course immune from any issues that Blockchain may run into? (since, your funds are now completely on your own computer? If that's the case, and I back up my wallet regularly from there, I can also assume I'm immune from losing my bitcoins in case my computer ever crashes?)
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:27:09
hey, I underestimated Bitcoin too very recently... just last week I predicted that it would another 6 weeks before it would 100. Me thinks it'll be there in the next 6 days at the latest, now. :)
@_date: 2013-09-09 03:19:46
Awesome work you guys.  Thank you in advance! You're helping to chang the world - and that's not hyperbole. 
I have a question: How exactly will I interface w/ the machine? If I have a bunch of coins I want to sell, I presume I'll bring my phone/tablet and wirelessly send to the machine's address to get the cash? Likewise, I assume the process will be totally anonymous (ie- no pre-screening of the clients using the ATM?)  
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:08:54

@_date: 2013-11-07 23:20:21
yeah, probably, that's why I "tested" about 100-150 different passwords :)
And according to the site op's they are not downloading the entered passwords, and you can allegedly check via the site code. (which, I have no idea, I'm not a programmer, at all.)
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:55:38
Ah yes, I've heard about that.  
But for now, I'm just trying to balance security w/ ease of execution. :) 
And I'm running Windows, and this method seems very straightforward and relatively very safe, to me. (that said I do have Ubuntu on an older system, would the Linux thing work for that?)
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:32:36
Even if this is bunk, it's a shame that this has been downvoted into oblivion.  
I enjoy a good Bitcoin circlejerk every now and then, but I hope this sub doesn't turn into that, completely. We need to always be willing to discuss (legit) concerns like this one.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:16:57
Normally when I keep seeing someone repeat the same line over and over again it just gets tiresome and old... but, I somehow really *feel* the enthusiasm and joy every time you write that accompained w/ your little emoticon guy, and I have to say, that joy and enthusiasm is very contagious.
Bro hugs to you, ToTheMoonGuy!

All the best to you guys! 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:30:37
A paper is just a copy (either in long-hand or a qr-code) of your key, yes? 
I'm using Multibit - how am I able to actually *see* my wallet key? I know it's saved in the wallet.dat file, but that's it.... 
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:15:54
Awesome, so, being a Canadian w/ Bitcoins, I can now buy stuff off Amazon.com through you guys... (There's just so much more available there than on the Canadian website.)
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:48:15


Yes! that is a *great* question.  I thought this was just a Multibit thing, I didn't know it was a systemic issue.  At least w/ Multibit, you can see a realtime list of all the wallets linked to that key, but obviously that's not the case w/ a paper wallet or cold storage. What a headache that would be, trying to keep track of everything.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:18:55
"imagine if gov't passes a law.... and the make it illegal to own bitcoin... and block all bitcoin transactions, all of your bitcoins would be worthless"
ugh, I literally cringed.  This guy is so ignorant and wrong, I actually feel a little bad for him.

@_date: 2013-11-07 05:06:41
Hey there, I already have some BTC's myself, but I'm still trying to grasp the concept of a paper wallet... hope you can help me understand.
just so I'm clear, if I have some BTC's now in a self-installed client, I can just go to bitaddress.org, create a paper wallet, (save all the pertinent data relating to it, screenshot, hard copy, etc) - and then send all my BTC's to that paper wallet address, and even though I'll never have to 'convert' the paper wallet to a conventional online one, my BTC's will be there, anyway? 
I assume that b/c even though the paper wallets are generated on the fly they obviously all follow the 'language' (for lack of a better term), so you never really have to personally interface them w/ the network, as the network will recognize them instantly, once you go to actually move or cash them out? (ie- to move or spend them, you'll eventually have to introduce that PW to the network?)
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:58:21
Here's an excellent POV as to why it's not a bubble like a tech stock or a house...




TLDR; unlike a house or tech stock, as the adoption rate increases, BTC's themselves have more utility merely by more people having them (ie- more businesses accept them, more websites, more people in general use them - demand increases, which drives up the price)
