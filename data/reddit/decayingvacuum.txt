And how could you or anyone be convinced of this ownerlessness.

Seems like Segwit and Batching would fit right into this priority... Rather than being a _new feature_.

since I don't use Coinbase, you'll have to enlighten me.
At present, *480 satoshis/byte* is a very reliable fee to have a transaction included in the next block. What is coinbase charging for their fee right now?
Does coinbase give you the option to delay transactions for lower fees? For example if I can wait a couple hours to _cash out_ a reasonable fee would be about *270 satoshis/byte*. That would reliably get my transaction to one of the next 12 blocks.

Ah ok so the first _paragraph_ of the quotation you provided from the blog post is irrelevant to the topic here of Segwit and Batching. Sorry I misunderstood. 
I truly wonder why anyone would use coinbase if they are unwilling to prioritize providing a functioning product.

No actually I haven't used coinbase. I can't imagine the average person using coinbase wouldn't find lower fees beneficial. Avoiding implementing _features_ that reduces fees they pay seems strange. If they are unable to understand that the health of the bitcoin network is relevant to the performance of their platform, I don't see why anyone would use them.

Pretty simple.
Segwit reduces the size of transactions. Smaller transactions means more transactions per block. More transactions per block means faster transactions.
Batching is also reduces the total size of the transactions. Smaller transactions means more transactions per block. More transactions per block means faster transactions.

Who are the *rats* in this scenario?

We need to get ahead of the game!
Here's some meme fuel:

Take the total network hashrate and divide by your solo hashrate and that's roughly the big number in the odds.

Just wow...

Isn't majority rule by definition **not** a decree? The definitions seem mutually exclusive to me. If we're to say that the majority constitutes a singular entity, then that would seem to be very circular logic.

 pegs the next BCH retarget at just under 7 hours. Then BTC block rate will get back to normal.
