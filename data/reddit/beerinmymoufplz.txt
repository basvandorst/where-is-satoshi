Loads of insightful bits in this article, including a discussion/examination on the Tulip Mania that Bitcoin so often gets compared to. Linking to this article will now be my go-to rebuttal. ;)
One of my favorite excerpts:


Bitcoin has been around for eight years now, it has captured the imagination, ingenuity, and investment of a massive number of very smart people, and it is increasingly trivial to convert it to the currency of your choice. Can you use Bitcoin to buy something from the shop down the street? Well, no, but you can’t very well use a piece of gold either, and no one argues that the latter isn’t worth whatever price the gold market is willing to bear. Gold can be converted to dollars which can be converted to goods, and Bitcoin is no different. To put it another way, enough people believe that gold is worth something, and that is enough to make it so, and I suspect we are well past that point with Bitcoin.

It's pretty long article and not an altcoin-centric one at that. You commented and therefore must have finished it in just under 3 mins to provide this assessment then? Nah, friend, perhaps it's you who should GTFO.

The point of this article is not to indicate a forthcoming crash. If that was your takeaway, I fear you missed the point(s). It's to illustrate that money is nothing more than a shared *fiction* we all agree to; yes, even USD! So, haters of Bitcoin be damned. If we hodl'ers believe there's value than their *is* value.
