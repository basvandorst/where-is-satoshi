Says "Could not find wallets on the profile" -- is this a generic message? I noticed that if I change the username it will give a different message saying the profile was not found. Would it say password incorrect, or could not find wallets on the profile if it was a password issue?
I'm just curious why every previous release did not have an issue with local wallets and this one did

I didn't do the email/password, I had a local wallet -- so there was no username, just a pin that I had to put in

Yeah, unfortunately I'd gotten over confident in them since every update since their release to Google Play did not delete local wallets, and it was mostly a throw away wallet (kept a small amount for transferring to newbies and small purchases if I come across an establishment). This upgrade to 1.0 certainly deletes your local wallet though it seems

I did not ever create a cloud storage wallet; I did not backup the local wallet. I've replied to your suggestion there as it will not work. I have the option to paste in a plain text backup w/ a password, or the cloud login option. What the heck was Bitpay thinking by deleting your local wallet with the upgrade? A warning would have been nice...

Just a warning to some out there that use this, I've been using copay since it was announced and have had zero issues with updates via the Play Store until this one. It wiped out my local wallet when I updated Copay this time, and unfortunately I didn't have a backup, but I did not use it for much money so I only lost $10-15 because of this issue, but still annoying

Regardless, so if I have a username and password for my local wallet, it does not detect any wallet and wants me to create a new one. I certainly did not make a "cloud" wallet. I would think if it didn't delete my local username/password wallet, I would have the option to login to that wallet with such. That is not an option.

Is there a way to downgrade from 1.0 and go back to my old wallet? Seems pretty stupid for them to do an upgrade like this to the general public through the Play Store without some sort of warning

Careful when you upgrade! It wiped out my local wallet
