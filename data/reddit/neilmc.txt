Meh, I heard you can only withdraw 10 BTC per day from the Chinese exchange.
It's a small change exchange.

I did include a fee but it was just the default 0.005 one.
I sent another transaction about 90 minutes ago with a 0.01 fee and that's still had no confirmations either.

The best thing to do is buy what you can afford to lose, no more. If you really do want to take out a loan then sure, why not but make sure you can pay it off without relying on Bitcoin returns. This is what I did. However if I just borrowed $30,000 last year and sunk it all into Bitcoins I would have made much more right now.

Tell them you lost pretty much all of it due to some bad trades, then don't tell them anything more.

The substitute to Bitcoin is of course the 'alternate crypto currencies' There's a several of them too. For example Litecoin based on Scrypt and PPCoin using Proof of Stake to name just two of them.
We're going to be hearing a lot more about these in the future.

This would be a great promotional tool for Coinlab if you break the $50 boundary with your large purchase.
Everyone will hear the name Coinlab. In fact it could be worth a million dollars just in advertising.

Most Bitcoin users aren't in the US.
I suspect they will attempt to control it and be really pissed off when they realise there is no way to really control Bitcoin.
Given a large enough budget someone could create true chaos in the Bitcoin markets if they wanted to.

The crash is just getting started. It's almost impossible for people to move large amounts of money into and out of exchanges.
The price of Bitcoin will go much lower before there's any recovery.
If anything I'd say the crash has 'stalled' because of banking issues. When these banking issues are resolved the selloffs will resume.

What country are you from ?
If you're in the UK then you can get some today from blockchain.info using the PingIt payment system. Anyone can have a pingit account, I use it and my main bank is Lloyds. Note - PingIt is run by Barclays but you can setup a new account in just a few minutes using an SMS to confirm then make a transfer of upto 500 pounds per day from your normal bank account. I do mine online and it's instant.
I've purchased all my BTC through blockchain.info - about 7000 pounds in total so far. Through various trades and a foray into the recent Litecoin pump and dump at precisely the right time I appear to have accumulated $30,000 in my MtGox account.
If you're not in the UK then I suggest you put your country in the original post as buying bitcoins is all about which country you're in.

It's strange isn't it. Being accused of laundering money out of your own US bank account.
To get money into your US bank account in the first place you need to go through AML regulations as well so I would have thought that money already in a US account should be considered pretty clean.
If you were making a large cash deposit then I could understand the hesitation.

Paypal and Bitcoin are just the first few steps on the ladder to disrupting Visa and Mastercard.
If they work together it will happen faster.
If not it will still happen only a bit slower and paypal will also get left behind.

It would be a good way to get money into the 'digi system'
It would require a trusted bank to issue coins for the same price continuously.
This trusted central bank would also need to buy them back for the same price as they are pegged to.
This could be done on a blockchain style system allowing p2p transfers.
Some level of transparency could be achieved by minting new coins each time they are sold to users and destroying them once they are 'cashed out'.

Changing IP addresses, logging in from different countries or well known VPN services and using TOR have been known to cause this issue.
I believe it's to prevent hackers from stealing your Bitcoin. Hackers use TOR, etc when they do their stealing so they can't be traced.

Every international wire I've ever sent required the address of the receiving bank branch and the full name and address of the account which receives the payment.
I tried to get one put through a while back without the address and they told me it's needed in case something goes wrong like an account number is incorrect so there can be no doubt as to where the transfer should end up.
