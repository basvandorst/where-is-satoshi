Is there/will there be a way to see which coins have been locked and for how long, or is it private?

At least then you'll have a choice to use an on-chain transaction or a company. If nodes are centralized, then nefarious forces could be choosing which transactions are relayed or not.

Why do they have four hosts and only one guest? Why not have one host and four guests? The one host says "Banks are so highly regulated, **we** have to pass stress tests, **we** have to have appropriate capital ratios...."
Why does she use "we", has a banker scripted this for her?

Could large fiat transactions subsidise smaller transaction fees?
Transaction fees based on transaction data size are fair enough, but if you're transferring $1 million on the bitcoin blockchain, a fee of  $100 would still be minuscule (0.01%) of the total. Could these fees be made to subsidise small, coffee-sized everyday transactions, e.g. the $1-10 range?
