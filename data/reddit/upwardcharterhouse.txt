One time I sold an Xbox on eBay. The buyer sent me the money over PayPal, so I shipped him the Xbox. After I shipped the Xbox the buyer was able to reverse the transaction, keep his money, and receive the Xbox at the same time. 
This is one of many reasons why I use bitcoin now.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:17:43
This was about 2 years ago. They claimed no fault, and told me I fell for a well known “plunger scam”. They said I should’ve waited a month for the money to be confirmed in my account to ship the Xbox. After that I basically gave up and took the loss.

They would probably shill him Nano.

The other week I bought BTC on Cash App for no fee. The price of BTC was $9600 but they sold it to me at a rate of $9850. Sure there is no fee on cash app but their exchange rate is terrible.
Edit: I’m not pro cash app or pro Coinbase, just pointing out anytime you buy bitcoin there is probably going to be some sort of fee even if it’s hidden.

Isn’t that the exact same quote Elizabeth Holmes used?

If you ask about XRP in the Bitcoin subreddit, everyone will trash it. Same thing will happen if you ask about Bitcoin in the XRP subreddit. Best to do your own research.

Judging by his username it’s probably Xanax.... I don’t know much about the dark web but I’m surprised people still use bitcoin. Just because it’s anonymous doesn’t mean it’s private....
@_date: 2018-09-08 03:25:41
These options work great for Americans and people with bank accounts. For the unbanked, bitcoin is the answer.

Anonymity means that we can see the transactions on the public ledger but the transactions are only made by wallet addresses (no personal info).  Private would mean there is no way to see any transactions. Technically if someone really wanted to find out who owns a anonymous wallet it could be possible to figure out the identity of the owner if said owner isn’t 100% covering their tracks.
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:53:24
The transaction from wallet to wallet would show up on the actual blockchain. If some one figured out what IP address was used when the wallet was generated that could possibly identify the creator of the wallet.

Can you ELI5 on the relevance of this?

If your renting, your renters insurance should cover this. If you own your house than homeowners should cover this as well.

Sounds like a scam, this post should be deleted 
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:58:05
Honestly I don’t think there is any good way. There is a few places like Purse.io or Paxful.io but BTC is going for like $10K so it’s pretty expensive.

Is running a node the same thing as mining?

@_date: 2018-06-18 14:11:43
So nodes take a lot less energy to run? Also are there rewards to running a node?

I’m not selling for a loss... ever. The money on my ledger I don’t even think of as money or budget with. And hopefully your right. I bought in January ( and DCAing ever since) so I’m about 65% down on my investment, but seeing some of my coins being 90% down (REQ) is pretty scary

BTC is easy to do that with because it’s here to stay. I’m nervous that my alts will hit 0 or become redundant before the next bull run comes.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:39:53
Is this good or bad?

I don’t agree with OP (bitcoin isn’t a scheme). But it takes most people there entire life to get rich. 3 years is the definition of “get rich quick”
