I listen to Peter Schiff and he is entertaining to listen to.  I just say bitcoin every time he says gold. He sounds a lot smarter when this is done.

He is talking about, amongst stock ownership and settlements, an exchange for share location for short sellers to find available shares for the borrowing of a stock they are looking to short, without going through a brokerage.  Normally, the brokerage charges money for lending shares to a short seller at a mark-up from what it costs the brokerage to borrow the shares from the original shareholder.  The profit margin (mark-up) on this share-lending activity is upwards of 1000% according to Byrne, and this type of activity accounts for 40%+ of profits for brokerages like Goldman Sachs (according to Byrne).  This exchange will cut out the brokerages as the middle men and will create a market that will directly connect short sellers and share holders who are willing to loan their shares out to hedge funds, traders, etc for short-selling.  This will allow shareholders to earn more money for loaning out their shares on the exchange (as opposed to loaning them to the brokerage and getting a pittance for it), and save short sellers money because there won't be a middle man marking up the price to borrow the shares.  This would remove brokerages from the entire process completely, and save a lot of money in the process.  
Here's a link to the video.  He talks about the sharelending exchange in part 2:

What's your thought on adding litecoin to your exchange?

You're argument began with "it will not happen" and ended with "it will not happen soon". Skepticism is the first step towards faith.
