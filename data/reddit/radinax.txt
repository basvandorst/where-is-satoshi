Thats the rate we're getting it at, from 3000000 it doesn't go down, it doesn't help that our money is getting devalued every week.

There's a big difference in the sense that they won't find any resistance here because our army is jackshit compared to Saddam. Well we can either choose to die slowly in this country or bet for a better solution, its not easy being in this spot :/

Believe me, we can't be worse, the government is doing their best to destroy our currency so it lowers so the military gets more value from the dollar inside the country, they're destroying a country and people are dying because we cant find the proper medicines and people are literally eating from the garbage, I would hope I was just exagerating..

Last year yeah it was pretty bad.. now we can get but at stupid prices sadly.

Yeah, there is a exchange Bolivar to BTC (lucky for us!) through Localbitcoins, from there we can change it to USD through Uphold but Idk if its worth, I still like them in BTC.

Venzuelan right here, we do need an invasion because the Government is on a basically declared Dictatorship and they hold the army giving them dollars at a cheap price, they won't come out easy and we need help badly.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:52:45
Daily transactions no, but there are a few people like me using it to save their money since our currency is getting devaluated weekly.

El problema mio no es el dinero, la inseguridad es extrema ya no salgo con mi teléfono a la calle, no se consiguen las medicinas y aun para mi que ganó en dólares, se me hace costosa la comida, si yo tengo esa ventaja y solo, como hace una familia con hijos? Pero no espero que otros entiendan el problemon tan grande que tiene este país.

If you don't live in this mess then why are you talking about being dramatic? Do you like seeing people eating from the trash in the streets like if its normal? Do you like seeing people and children starving to death? We don't even have water where I live because of lack of maintance of the company thats responsible of distributing it, other states have 12 hours without light, lets not even talk about how being sick = death because of lack of medicines.
We need help really bad, why you think people are escaping from the country? Whatever considering your response its a waste of time even answering, but it might be useful for someone else wanting context, as if there wasn't enough.
