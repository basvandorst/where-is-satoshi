How are you storing it?

Income and wealth are indeed very different things, even just looking at income however $32,000 a year is alot in many countries, and I do not believe that the vast majority here surpass that. Most certainly however does being able to go on this subreddit and buy a bit of bitcoin not put you in that 1%. Keep downvoting me into oblivion all you want, I stand by this point

That does not remotely make single percentile, get your information straight before spewing things out as "facts".

That sounds great, I'll look into that. Thanks!

Sounds promising, and yes, winter is coming and I feel bad wasting electricity when it could be spent mining.
@_date: 2016-10-09 19:46:04
Thank you

How did the mining go? Any profit or were you even able to break even on the hardware costs?
@_date: 2016-10-09 06:04:53
And it is great, apart from it's $1400 cost. Damn.

I was looking to use my own PC, not buy external equipment for thousands of dollars. I'm not looking to be efficient for this, just doing something with the electricity rather than nothing.

Killerstorm summed it up pretty good, but let me put it real nice and simple for you. 
1. Get an electric heater and the electricity goes straight to heat with no productivity.
2. Set up some type of mining equipment and the electricity is expended into heat through algorithms, making me money whilst heating shit up.
Let's look at this:
1. Heat
2. Heat + get money
Hmm.....
