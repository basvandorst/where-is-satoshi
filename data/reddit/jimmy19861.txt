Right it's not a replacement, 
Why would I ever want to consolidate my LN channel with a central high liquidity hub?
No need to argue that most transactions will occur offchain. 
When there is not enough transactions, miners will move to a more profitable chain, making on- chain transactions fees even higher. So ppl will keep trading with LN channels making strong hubs even stronger.

No, 
miners today need to work with PoW, meaning they need CPU power.
LN is more like PoS. you need liquidity, lots of it to be a central profitable hub.

I understand LN.
Yes you are teoratically right, anyone can run a LN node.
But for the user, I want to have minimal hops in any transaction. That is user incentive he don't care about decentralization.
How he will make minimal hops? Using a well known, high liquidity node in the network.

Bitcoin or not, it does not matter.
There are so many shelter dogs, please consider this before buying your "new best bud".
There are so many buddies alone, waiting for a family and an opportunity for a new life.

So we basically agree.
It does not matter if its a layer on top of bitcoin like LN, Ethereum based tokens or whatever.
Transactions on the bitcoin blockchain will always be expensive.

I think its time we start understanding that bitcoin is a value store. Not a day to day currency to buy coffee.
The reason debt fiat currencies were created first place was to allow people not to carry their gold or whatever precious assets they had.
Bitcoin is the new gold.
To buy coffee, i believe you will use another altcoin that was better designed to handle these types of transactions
Stop looking at bitcoin as a revolution. Bitcoin is just an application of the blockchain revolution.

China is not really trying to break bitcoin.
China is trying to break the weak hodlers by manipulating the market and make quick profits.
