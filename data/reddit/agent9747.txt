That’s why they’re working on lightning network which will be out soon 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:55:38
The next level is when you get happy when the price drops because then you can get some more at a lower price lol 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:18:45
Wouldn’t $2018 be even better?
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:02:02
You pay 0% in fees when you buy and sell in GDAX, only if you use limit tho. Otherwise you pay 0,25%. 
Coinbase takes 4% when you buy and sell so you’ll save a lot in that way too. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:30:38
Yes!! I just found the address, how can I contact the owner??
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:03:12
If you place limit you pay 0% fee. Otherwise 0,25% fee
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:19:00
You may be right, I'll restore my Mac tonight, not risking everything again...

Coinbase is very good for newbies as its very easy to use but they have a high fee (around 4%). GDAX, which is owned by Coinbase, is a bit harder to use but you don't pay any fees at all. 
If you're planning to put 140ish every month its probably a good idea to invest in a hardware wallet (Ledger or Trezor for instance). It's never recommended to save your coins on an exchange
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:44:06
Haha cheers mate 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:09:07
oh thats awesome, thanks! :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:51:46
I hope it’s today, don’t have anything watch worthy on Netflix and I’m ready with my popcorn :p
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:22:21
Done :)
Where is the “other” option under gender tho? *triggered* 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:36:59
I agree about how stupid some of the questions are but that's just how it is with majority of people. As Bitcoin is getting more popular we are going to see this kind of questions more and more from average Joe's who probably doesn't know any better. 
It doesn't mean we should shut them down tho, we should help them understand better.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:39:45
Yes! We humans, for good or bad, always wanting more. 
I totally agree, if we want Bitcoin to ever succeed we have to drop the moon mentality and start spending. It is kinda hard to do it right now because of high fees but hopefully if LN fixes that we will see more people open to spending their BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:28:48
But can it protect?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:56:00
That’s not bitcoins website. That’s some bullshit altcoin. Bitcoin.org is the website 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:15:02
Yes I feel you, we will get there mate don’t lose faith :)
Absolutely, and hopefully it will be resolved with Lightning Network. But as I said, it’s just a part of being a early adopter

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:35:02
Yes thank you, someone else suggested it and it was there! Unfortunately not the same address I tried to send to 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:05:26
No thanks, let them do all the dirty work they wanna do. We’re staying classy 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:33:06
Pretty big. Bitcoin is still relatively new and anything can happen. The whole market can crash tomorrow for all I know and that’s why you should never invest more than you’re willing to lose.  And as a investor you should always think about worst case scenario 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:45:20
It’s secure and your money and coins are insured but it’s still better and safer to own your private keys and that’s why you should invest in a hardware wallet, TREZOR or ledger nano s for instance. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:19:41
Just checked and it wasn't there :/ 
Happy that you could get back yours :)

Yes that's usually how it goes for me too, very strict on correcting words but never tried to correct a btc address before, I'm honestly very confused right now... Going to contact gdax tomorrow and see if its anything they can help me with (probably not)
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:15:29
is (0.01137376/3)*2 really that hard?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:37:53
It’s possible but I don’t think it will be worth it due to electricity cost. Now if you can connect it to your grandpas pacemaker maybe you could make a dollar or two 
Edit: thanks for Reddit Gold &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:31:50
Yes that’s true, my theory is that it “auto corrected” to some other address I’ve used before or maybe a malware. Could also be that I got clumsy and did some other stupid thing, honestly I’ve no idea how it all went down

Welcome to Bitcoin. 
Invest whatever you’re comfortable with, never invest more than you can afford to lose. 
Begin with a small amount so you can get the hang of it and then you can add more over time. 
Coinbase is a good place to begin for newbies, it’s very simple and easy to use but they have a high fee of 4%, later when you know more about Bitcoin you can start to look into more advanced platforms like GDAX with low fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:10:27
That was what I was thinking too and double checked all my accounts on different exchanges but couldn't find it :/ Must be someone else's address I have used before.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:26:59
Why cash out when it’s the future of money?

Hodl my hand 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:09:31
Yes it was totally my fault and no one else to blame, I have no idea what it changed to but everything went through, and I can't even see what address it was sent to because GDAX doesn't show that, they just have some Transfer ID that is not searchable on blockchain.info 
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:32:32
After reading some of your old posts I don’t know if you’re trolling or just not that smart 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:19:42
Damn that’s very smart. Thank you dude 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:12:37
...that’s too dumb to even respond to 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:19:52
You have a point there, but I still don’t see a problem with that 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:13:11
GDAX doesn't show the address you've transfered to in their history page, just som transfer id that is not searchable on blockchain.info :(

Sorry but that’s a stupid proposal. 
If you’re OK with giving away $11k to him if he loses everything, why wouldn’t you just buy one bitcoin by yourself and then you will keep 100% of the profits instead of 25%

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:16:39

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:36:27
yes good idea, im going to search through everything and see if it belongs to any friends or services :/ 
thanks so much!!
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:29:47
Yeah I feel you, it feels like you had a lot of bitcoins and reached your moon nothing wrong with cashing out some of them and living life, instead of stressing every time the price goes down, and all the drama :)
I lost all of my coins some days ago and right now I’m just a outsider lol 
It sucks but I hope I can slowly start to save money so I can jump right back on. 
I understand your point about how Bitcoin has become a storage of value more than a currency, but I think when we reach a point where the price stabilizes and doesn’t go up &amp; down as crazy as it does now, we will see people spend more. 
I’m hoping LN paves the way for mass adoption and also getting people to spend more BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:42:05

Yeah basically, but I think most people think it’s “confirmed” when it reaches on GDAX.  
And to be fair, fiat money also has different rate depending on which exchange you use.

How to transfer bitcoins from coinbase for free: 
Go to gdax.com and log in with your coinbase account. GDAX is owned by coinbase and it’s their platform for more technical people. 
After you log in, verify your account if necessary. After that click on “deposit” and deposit your bitcoins from your coinbase account into GDAX (it’s free and takes only seconds), then you need to press “withdraw” and then press “BTC address” and put the address you want to send your bitcoins to in there. There are no fees when sending from GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:13:44
How can you promise him that you will cover his losses then? If he loses everything you’ll have to pay 11k 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:24:13

@_date: 2017-11-13 18:26:10
It will be free with some premium add-ons that you can purchase. Go to  if you wanna subscribe to the waiting list. 
It will have a lot of features that other apps miss and that’s why I built it. It will have a smart notification system, Apple Watch app, widget complication and most importantly a GREAT design. 
Please let me know if you have any tips or suggestions :)
And yes I’m aware of how similar blackfolio is to Blockfolio. I didn’t know about Blockfolio when I chose Blackfolio but I will change it to something else before release. I should have researched more and I’m sorry. Please let me know if you have any good name suggestion. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:54:13
Welcome to bitcoin!
If you’re a beginner I would recommend Coinbase, they have a higher fee (4%) but it’s much easier to use. Later when you have more experience you can use GDAX, GDAX has 0% fee when you place a limit order but it’s much harder to use compared to Coinbase. 
GDAX is actually owned by Coinbase so sending your assets between them is free and takes seconds. Your Coinbase account will also work with GDAX. 
When you have more bitcoins in the future it’s a good idea to invest in a hardware wallet so you can store your bitcoins there. It’s much safer to store your coins in a hardware wallet than an exchange like coinbase. Two of the best hardware wallets are Ledger wallet and TREZOR. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:25:32

@_date: 2017-11-01 02:46:24

Fees and transaction time will be a lot lower when the majority start to use Segwit
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:29:36
It’s just a copy paste version of bitcoin.org, they just changed “bitcoin” to “Segwit2x” in every sentence. Probably a troll

GDAX. No fees
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:46:26
It’s just a high point for celebration. 
You don’t say oh New Year’s Eve doesn’t matter to me and I’m not gonna celebrate it because we’re basically in 2018 right now, when it’s 30 December 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:09:33
Yes 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:27:48
Coinbase has insurance up to 250 000USD like regular banks and they only have 2% of their funds online so yes it’s safe.

@_date: 2017-11-28 01:47:14
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:04:42
That doesn’t prove anything. It is because Bitcoin is still relatively new, USD has been around for decades. 
It is just like how internet took over shopping, dictionary, books and much more. 
It is like how blockbuster turned into Netflix. 
New technologies replaced old technologies.

Homepage is mid market price. Buy page is the buy price. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:04:21
Yes and then I’m going to sell all the emails to car dealers so they can spam you with good deals on Lamborghinis ;) you got me 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:58:08
Yeah I meant 100USD haha. 
Yes I told them about hardware wallets too and recommended that they look into that if they’re gonna buy more bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:39:05
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:55:55
Its unbelievable 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:35:37
Basically the design language of iOS 11.
Your picture will act as a setting button there you can personalize your experience by changing your local currency and much much more. Thats why I though picture+name was a good idea, because of the personalization.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:29:23
You can store and buy crypto both on GDAX and coinbase. 
The main difference between this two are one thing: ease of use. 
Coinbase is much easier to use, friendlier with a better UX. Everyone can use it, they even have an iOS/Android app which is super convenient BUT you have to pay a 4% fee for every purchase. 
GDAX on the other hand is a bit harder to use, specially for the average people, and they don’t have a mobile app BUT you pay between 0,25% and 0% fees depending on your type of buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:05:47
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:57:12
Will update this post when the website is up, gonna dm you the link too :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:52:15
There is a 0,25% fee when you place a market order. There is no fee when placing a limit order :) 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:31:13
Oh yeah, Sketch is *much* better than PS
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:34:10
Yes it’s down 0,2% today definitely crashing. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:29:12
What has Hillary anything to do with bitcoin? Lol 
And people have been calling bitcoin a bubble and yet the price just goes up 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:11:14
Hahahaha WHAT??
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:42:27
Why does everyone keep sharing this website? It’s straight up a clone of bitcoin.org website, is it just me that thinks it’s just a troll?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:41:39
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:38:08
Yes exactly, much better language (swift) and 2-3 times bigger market. That’s why new apps usually come to iOS first or even if they have both iOS and android version, the iOS version tend to work better. 
But android will be the priority as soon as iOS version is out :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:15:29
Got you ����
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:54:18
No it doesn’t?
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:43:52
The app I’m building will have this functionality, I’m using yahoo finance for now and they have it too (just not as good) ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:24:41
Are you gonna buy me dinner first at least? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:12:00
Happy to hear!
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:48:21
What app is it?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:26:59
Thank you! I hope you enjoy it when it is released :) 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:11:41
The website will be up soon and you’ll be able to subscribe to be notified. I’ll dm you the link when it’s up :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:30:26
It’s just a copy paste version of bitcoin.org website, they just changed “bitcoin” to “Segwit2x” in every sentence. Probably a troll
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:51:22
I agree with you saying that your balance is just a promise of BTC and not actual bitcoin just like how banks work. And that’s why you should never put your BTC in an exchange, hardware or paper wallet is the safest way to go. 
But that said, they’re still the best exchange and pretty much the only option for regular people 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:27:53
Exactly! Coinbase is a good exchange but never store your coins there. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:19:46
I will start with the Android version as soon as iOS version is done. :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:35:29
It will support a rough exchange rate calculation to most local currencies.
Yes! You will be able to manually enter your portfolio :) 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:54:17
Yes they will automatically become rich as soon as they invest $1 in bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:29:57
Just like literally everything else. What is your point?
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:01:58
Use coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:41:58
It will have Coinbase, Bittrex and other exchanges too. The beauty is that you can choose where you wanna pull the data from. 
Hmm weird I’m gonna DM you so we can hopefully solve it :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:04:10
Obama is clearly a clone made of alien horse sperm by Mr. Illuminati. What else do you think they do in Area 51? They invented Obama the same way electricity was invented so Mr. Illuminati could invade Middle East. It is very simple dude. /s 
I'm very sorry for assuming Mr. Illuminati's gender, it could be a girl for all I know.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:25:54
It will have this feature! :D
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:24:41
Regular people prefer easiness over privacy any day of the week. Just look how much information they’re willing to give to google, Facebook etc...
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:56:05
Looks like we’re already on the moon on the picture tho 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:11:41
Who compared Bitcoin with stocks tho? the "=X" stands for currency. They have BTCCAD=X and other fiat currencies too
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:44:23
He asked if he could have his money there for a week. If you read his threat you can see that he has already ordered a hardware wallet and it will arrive in a week 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:59:30
Didn't know about them until 2 hours ago unfortunately. Going to pick a new name!
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:30:35
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:58:29
Bitcoins value isn’t really in the technology, it’s more about supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:57:22
You tell me Obama wasn't invented by US? lmao 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:18:06
If you really fucking like swearing, then I wouldn’t take the bet. Because you’re going to swear at some point sooner or later and lose your 2 coins 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:28:44
Trust me it’s much harder than you think to handle a website flawlessly and with good security as they have been since I joined them (except yesterday). It takes a lot of effort, so you can’t really compare it to an automated bot. 
I’m sure (or at least hope) that they had servers that could handle 2x their peak numbers, but 8x is just too much and too unpredictable.
Apple has had this problem before, google had that, Facebook had that. I’m sure pretty much every single big company has had this problem at some point. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:52:23
Damn someone is mad. Do you need a hug or something? &lt;3 love u 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:03:25
Thanks for your input, will definitely make it a feature :D
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:34:41
It is going to be worthwhile!
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:30:08
1 Lamborghini = 1 bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:27:59

@_date: 2017-11-20 07:09:27
What are you even complaining about?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:25:13
Yes I adressed the name [here!](
It will be changed before release :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:35:31
69k is my professional guess ;););)
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:01:12
It happens when you record the screen :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:21:01
lmao ��
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:43:50
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:44:43
Yes iOS first :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:13:14
For me it takes 1 day to do a SEPA transfer to Coinbase and then I just have to send the money to GDAX. The best option is to have your money in Coinbase so when the time is right you just have to send them to GDAX. 
And Coinbase have instant bank transfer in US now, I hope they expand that to Europe soon :) 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:06:53
Can only see a “title” section on the iOS app, nowhere to add the body text 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:32:55
You want to be sure that your investment is safe but you don’t want to read 2 paragraphs? 
“All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.” - from their website 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:45:00
Coinmarketcap, bittrex, coinbase and some other exchanges :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:43:34
Mostly swift, using xcode 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:23:20
It will have ;)

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:32:36
Thank you!

69k is my next goal for undisclosed reasons

The only thing this picture is missing is comic sans as font and a doge meme 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:31:59
I had the same issue thats why I designed my own app.
* It will have a lot of sources. Similar to tradingview
* You'll be able to use local currencies
* Privacy and security is very important to me. PIN, Touch ID and FaceID will be added.
* Price widget, smart notification and even an Apple Watch app are supported! :D
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:05:20
No you should invest left. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:45:21
You think its not? 
He is the same guy who told you Mt Gox and Bitcoin Unlimited were safe.
He is the same guy who promoted Segwit2x &amp; said that it is gonna be the 'real' Bitcoin, and when it failed (or if it was his plan from the beginning) he moved all his power to Bcash and telling everyone that it is the real bitcoin.
Can't you see the pattern?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:33:22
We made some good money there ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:19:08
wow I'm sorry about that. Going to investigate it!
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:16:27
Here’s a formula if you wanna to calculate it by yourself in the future. 
Price now = x
Price future = y 
How much you’re investing = z
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:01:47
I will!
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:41:32
The same thing goes with bitcoin...
And nothing backs USD actually, it used to be backed with gold but now you’re just putting faith in the government to not fuck up the dollar like many other countries or like it almost collapsed in 1980s. 
Bitcoin is backed with mathematical algorithms and we can only have 21 millions of them, USD can just be copied and multiplied so it’s very easy for the government to fuck everything up
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:23:28
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:02:46
I’m looking for the same thing!! Dm me if you find any good please 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:46:34
Will dm you a link to my website when it’s up so you can subscribe to the list :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:56:23

Thank you so much!
I was thinking about adding a logo for each cryptocurrency and forgot  about removing the whitespace before uploading it here haha. Didn't actually noticed it before you mentioned it :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:41:58
Yes I’m well aware of the very small group that have problem with coinbase and I’m not saying they’re flawless. Their customer service is a joke for instance but it doesn’t have anything to do with my point. My point is that their server issue wasn’t really their fault because you never prepare for 8 times of your peak numbers and they’re still like the only good website for regular people to start investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:14:23
You will become the new Tom Cruise 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:31:39
Watch some tutorials on YouTube. It’s not THAT easy but it’s still pretty easy :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:37:29
It is fine, I'm building it because it has some key features that I miss and Im glad to share the app with you.
I hope major crypto apps copy the features I'll have. Competition is always good :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:21:49
Good idea, gonna put it on the to-do list :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:00:48
Absolutely ����
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:19:22
From the portion of the transaction I believe

You can always trust me dude &lt;3

Yes sir! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:05:11
I would never betray BTC by buying BCH. 
It’s almost like if I cheated on my beautiful wife with her uglier, toothless sister.*
*I don’t have a wife 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:59:40
You got it!
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:05:52
The address changes every time to protect your privacy (it basically makes it harder to track where the money goes) but the old address can still receive bitcoin just fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:28:13
It is going to be worth it, promise :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:58:47
What? I haven’t sent the subscription list to any spam companies if that’s what you mean. 
I tested the website with a small test group and didn’t find any security loopholes with the subscription form. 
I even got a HTTPS certificate to make everything from and to the website encrypted for everyone’s security. 
Right now there is only one user that has reported this issue so it can be just a coincidence that he got a spam email after 10 minutes, but I’m still investing this issue to be certain. 
I don’t understand why you’d think that is something I “coded” into the website. I wouldn’t gain anything from it. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:23:37
Yes. It is much easier to make money when you don't have any moral compass
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:09:14
Obama is Satoshi CONFIRMED
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:57:56
Use GDAX, they’re owned by Coinbase so you can send you assets between them totally free and it takes only seconds. 
Then buy bitcoin using the limit tab on GDAX, no fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:59:12
Didn't know about them until 2 hours ago unfortunately, I'm open to new names :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:08:08

@_date: 2017-11-12 16:42:08
At least you can have argue here without getting spammed with downvotes. You can't have a single conversation with people in r/btc
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:23:37
Thanks dude. This should be the default wallpaper on iPhone X lol 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:59:31
Awesome dude! I would say just go with it, but never invest more than you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:24:07
It is Sketch, basically the go to app for web/app designers. You should check it out!

Nice work! I really like the on the moon and skateboarding spaceman one.

Bittrex &amp; gdax are already integrated. If you’re looking for something specific pm me and I’ll include it if they have public api :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:29:55
Thanks for your input, very good idea. Will put it on the todo list
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:47:46
10 000USD on New Year’s Eve would be worth celebrating 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:27:01
I’ll put it on the todo list! damn you’re enjoying your series 3 huh? Still not available in Sweden unfortunately :/
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:13:51
You’ll have 419USD total. Don’t listen to the other guy who said 1,82% increase lol 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:46:29
As a web developer I can safely say I’ve never seen a website plan for 8x their peak numbers. It would just mean a waste of time and money and you may never need to use them 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:28:40
Who doesn't love pie, right? I'm going to put it on the to-do list! Thanks for your input
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:45:12

Honestly the website is something I put together very fast so people can subscribe to the mailing list. I need to work on it more.
Thanks for your offer, gonna dm you now :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:01:13
Yes. It will be a big part of the app :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:44:29
There is ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:30:19
Yes their B2X support was bullshit and I’ll never forget it, but it doesn’t make my point any less true 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:50:44
Step 1: Sue for 1 million, step 2: put the money in bitcoin, step 3: buy Lamborghini (the whole company) in 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:26:48
Lets! Will have a section dedicated to that on the website, stay tuned :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:26:32
Thanks! Will launch on iOS first then I'll start with the Android version.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:22:38
It will have the gain/loss functionality :)
Your other point is a very good idea, will definitely add it to the app in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:05:28
Looks very clean and nice!
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:01:40
It will have widget complication, Apple Watch app, smart notifications and much more. Stay tuned :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:41:29
Oh very good idea actually! 
Definitely gonna think about adding that in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:00:04

Yes I always thought Obama was a clone invented by US and the illuminati fellas to invade Middle East. /s


I don't know about "we" but you sure sound dumb :p
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:33:45
I personally don't see any resembles but thanks for your input. It will pull data from Coinmarketcap and many other sources :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:51:44
Your point doesn’t make any sense
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:44:21
 :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:42:35
It will feature a portfolio and you'll be able to add fiat currencies :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:45:51
Lend them to me you’ll definitely get them back in two years 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:43:10
Coinmarketcap, Bittrex, Coinbase and some other exchanges :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:03:32
Why are you so triggered dude hahaha 
You need some love really 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:45:53
I’ll dm you! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:57:36
Still have my series 0 :) 
Awesome! will put it on testflight.app for beta testing some weeks before launching. Gonna dm you a link to that later.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:09:25

@_date: 2017-11-13 18:38:18
How much are you trying to send? 
The fees have been kinda high recently but if you're transferring a lot then I say you should do it. I personally can't have a good night sleep if I have my coins in a exchange wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:58:03
They don't have widget complication, Apple Watch app, smart notifications and much more :)

@_date: 2017-10-09 00:52:10
The best way would be to transfer them to a hardware wallet. See: ledger Nano S

Smart thief 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:01:27
Then why doesn't he send his IOTA to a new account or some other exchange so he can convert them to BTC or withdraw or whatever he wants? Seems *very* sketchy to me
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:11:40
I don't understand the point of this post
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:31:19
Oh gotcha, I agree with you

Just happy to see you ��

Oh I misread that, I hope your commission was pretty sweet then ;) 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:54:45
I hope you’re right ;)
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:53:47
I think we have a new support at 4300USD so the price will likely drop in the next few days and after that we will see it rise to 5100USD.
Im still very worried about the hard fork, if we can maintain the same price point after the fork we will easily go to 7000USD til the end of this year 
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:11:27
Use GDAX, which is owned by Coinbase. 0 fees if you use the limit function

The problem is that all banks in Sweden are like that, and the even bigger problem is that according to the law they have the rights to do that if they suspect money-laundering. So damn stupid!!
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:55:38
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:02:08
I use ICA Banken because they're relatively new and small and therefore I thought they would respect their customers more and don't do BS like this, but I was wrong I guess.
My main bank is Nordea which is one if not the biggest bank in Sweden and they're *even* worse
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:57:15
Not as far as I know. We have limited banks too, I guess around 20 max and most of them are governments puppies. :/
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:34:34
Damn that sucks. Use Time Machine, I learned my lesson when I accidentally deleted some imported files.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:14:20
Yes. Good luck man 
@_date: 2017-10-09 06:56:43
yeah just wanna to mess with him lol
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:31:59
Your mixing transaction fees with buying fees. Coinbase has a 4% fee when you're buying.
If you want to avoid the 4% fee you can use the limit function on GDAX which is free. GDAX is owned by Coinbase so you can send money to it from your coinbase account and vice versa for free.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:37:27
It is by design, so no-one can trace you :) 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:07:27
What about other genders? *triggered* /s
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:38:27
Yeah me too, I have a backup of my time machine backup. Can’t trust those HDD drives haha. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:44:57
Because we're not suppose to hold, we are supposed to treat Bitcoin as a payment method if we want Bitcoin to succeed.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:35:38
Oh yes very true. It takes less than one day for me to transfer from my bank to Coinbase so I didn't think of that.
There is no deposit charge, however there is a 0,15EUR withdraw charge both on Coinbase and GDAX. :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:14:11
Why not 30 000?
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:16:17
Yeah I watched it when it came out, it was very good and had a good rating on IMDB. Too bad it was canceled :/
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:07:56
I hope they do so I can buy more bitcoin :p
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:05:23
Its getting more popular and somehow it will decrease the value, you say? 
Can you elaborate on that, please?

I'm from Sweden. It usually takes 2-3 days for folks in here but I don't know I have been kinda lucky haha. Yes I think my first one took 2 days.
Yes, same, bought some alt coins and ETH before it goes up after the gold fork ;)
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:12:06

So you’re bashing Coinbase for not letting their customers have access to a new fork (Bitcoin Cash) and at the same time youre bashing them for letting their customers have access to a fork (Segwit2x)?
I hate Segwit2x as much as any sane human, but oh come on!

Yeah dude it is so weird... Almost like different people have different opinions 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:05:30
We will probably hit the resistance  again. Hope I'm wrong though
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:08:04
We’re talking about BTG (Bitcoin Gold), which is a hard fork that just happened, not BCH (Bitcoin Cash) which happened a while ago.
BCH unlike BTG had a replay protection so you can send and receive BCH without any worries. However BTG does not have a replay protection so every transaction that happens on the BTG chain also happens on BTC (Bitcoin) chain. 
So for example if you send me 1 BTG I will also get 1 BTC, for free, and you will lose your 1 BTC.
So you should use BTG (Bitcoin Gold) with extreme caution until there is a safe way to split those two coins without compromising the other one. 
I hope I could help you :)
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:02:07
Yes convenience, its much easier to use.
Oh, too bad :/

I don’t really like the “bitcoin.org” part. It is big &amp; distracting, and it makes the product look more like a ad than an actual poster you’d buy. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:21:21
I predicted 5300USD to be the new support (and resistance at 6300USD) yesterday, right now we are at 5200USD and we are starting to see it begin gaining so I'm thinking we have hit the support.
I hope I'm wrong tho and it drops to 4s. Im going to buy more if it does :P
*edit*: Im very new to analyzing charts, so don't trust me dude
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:37:16

There is not so much information on the Gold fork because the developers don't communicate so much with others and it just sounds like a big scam. 
Coinbase announced this for 2-3 weeks ago about segwit2x
But if you want to be sure that your coins are safe move them out of coinbase before the fork. Move them to somewhere where you control the keys. Your best option will be a hardware wallet, See Ledger nano s or Trezor 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:14:17
How was that not civil?
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:20:09

There is no right or wrong answer, it all depends on how you feel. 
If you wanna make a small profit sell after you make a decent profit, if you really believe in their technology and think it will rise a lot in 2-3 years then hold and see what happens. It all depends on you. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:47:53
Thanks for your answer, really appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:57:19
Yes I think around 6300USD is the new resistance, then it will dip again and same story different day ;)

Very interesting, thats is something I would be interested in too. Thanks for sharing your idea :)

I use GDAX to buy/sell bitcoins, if you use the limit function there are no fees.
GDAX can be a little hard to use. Coinbase (which also owns GDAX) is much easier to use but the fees are pretty high (around 4%). Bittrex is also pretty good but the design and UI is pretty awful.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:25:33

Are you really calling them out for not giving 0.1BTC (500USD) to each new account?
And right now you're getting 10USD when you spend your first 100USD and 10USD for each friend you invite to Coinbase which is pretty good.
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:15:06
Bittrex works great but the UI is pretty bad

@_date: 2017-10-24 01:44:20
Bitcoin Gold doesn’t have any replay protection (at least not yet) so if you sell your Bitcoin Gold coins right now, you’ll basically give away your real bitcoin coins for free. 
Bitcoin Gold is a hard fork that just happened if you’re not aware.

I usually send money to Coinbase and then transfer it to GDAX, its free and happens right away. :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:58:26
Do you use google authentication? 
How do you know it was stolen from your phone? Maybe someone gained access to your password, which is very easy if you don't use google authentication.
What phone do you have? Is it iOS or Android? Android is *much* easier to hack so that could be a possibility. 
DO NOT EVER use a public wifi, it is very unsafe and very easy to gain access to someone else's device.
Sorry for your loss but I don't think you will get your money back.

Haha yeah we did get off on a wrong foot unfortunately, sorry for that. 
Yes I’ve seen it but it is not a good source criticism to just have their team as a source. 
A lot of Big companies (Coinbase, Trezor etc) are so against BTG because of the lack of communication and a lot of other things. 
I’m just wondering why is everyone against BTG if they are so legit.
I could be wrong of course, but bitcoin gold seems very sketchy in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:11:39
What difference would it make? They take a percentage.
