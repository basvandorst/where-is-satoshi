So just a bubble that'll crash down to $225 again?

I've had two with the same SSN for a good bit. Just two different bank accounts (otherwise they automatically link the two).
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:57:36
You had 6 figures worth of BTC laying around?
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:31:02
Still has a good bit of BTC laying around in this wallet:

If there are 2.3M users but 3M wallets, doesn't that mean one user has multiple accounts? I have 2 with separate limits myself, but that's besides the point.

Wouldn't news affect adoption, affecting price, as if its a stock/forex?
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:41:56
Oh, no wonder I didn't see a correlation between it and BTC
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:55:38
Back at 250!
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:07:59
So could it be institutional buying/exchanging?
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:41:18
When did they say that?
@_date: 2015-06-17 04:20:08
With two separate limits though. Recently my state approved BTC (PA), so I can request higher limits, but they deny me each time.
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:31:16
I managed to do it with 2...

No, that wasn't the sole/specific purpose. From the reading I have done, CB allows recreational resale (ie with friends) but not acting as a business, selling on LBC or the like, nor veering into MSB territory. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:01:05
Which is what I'm trying to figure out. I still don't have a definitive reason from them.
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:24:14
I never keep my BTC in LBC, unless its a situation like this where I'm forced to send it to an external wallet, since they have fantastic security.
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:40:32
I hate wire transfers for anything. That leaves Circle and Coinbase, both of which I can't use (another long story with Circle similar to this with Circle). Leaves me SOL.
@_date: 2015-07-11 12:44:22
So if the current share price is $30.60, does that mean the current price of a BTC should (technically speaking) be around $306?
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:47:10
Problem there is I can't acquire BTC through Circle/Coinbase anymore.
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:37:00
Doubt I can use their wallet. 
They didn't say anything specific, only the two replies as shown in my OP.
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:11:39
Living in/around Philly, this is satisfying. If only it was advertised in the title of the CL ad....
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:31:14
Wells Fargo, and just last week I linked Discover Bank to it as well, which is the only change I've made recently. Problem is it was fully verified with my SSN/$1k instant buy limits and everything.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:50:28
The Square Cash app just implemented this as well
@_date: 2015-09-04 20:20:39
They finally told me why. A person I sent .5 BTC was supposedly in violation of their user agreement for counterfeiting goods. They thought I bought said goods, against the user agreement. In reality, it was a BTC -&gt; paypal exchange with a friend, but they say I'm lying. I have transaction details if they want it, but haven't heard back. I don't like the idea that they track transactions - regular banks (usually) don't care, yet Coinbase cares that I'm an "accomplice" with someone I merely sold coins to.

If you're not planning on doing anything malicious, there should be no reason not to browse LocalBitcoins on a normal web browser. No one will search your house for buying BTC there. Your IP is monitored on the site and it makes Bitcoin sellers more skeptical when they see you're using Tor (or even a VPN).
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:20:39
Were you able to sell at a 15% premium at any point on LB?

Sorry, forgot some detail. Country is US but not limited to the US market, just preferred. Local Bitcoin rates when selling aren't as high as I'd like them to be, leaving for minimal gain. Depends on the person, I could have $500 or 1-2 BTC at a time.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:31:49
Will consider it/look into it, thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:09:31
That doesn't seem bad, but when I sell, its typically at a 10%-15% premium. That concept sounds like buy, wait for BTC to go up, then sell within 2%.

Wells Fargo shut me down (albeit gave me ~35 days notice) after initiating a $500 deposit to Gemini. Struck me as odd, since I've used the account for Coinbase before and never had an issue. Now I'm fighting to get my money at the bank un-frozen.
I'm not sure about you, but they refuse to state why they're closing my account. $500 withdrawn from the account on June 7, closure notice letter sent June 8. Coincidence? Doubt it. Try an online bank, they tend to be more lenient - Capital One 360 especially.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:00:10
I use them for a portion of my buying, but scanned the site when you mentioned selling and didn't see anything. Do you make money with LB (or is that not your goal)?

ACH, nearly a decade old.
