you'd rather use a general purpose court for dispute resolution? it'll cost more and since they don't really know anything about markets or trading you'll just get random arbitrary rulings.

yes, but you need to be careful as your wallet will (by default) spend it at the same time as your normal btc.

I heard you can use 4g near the borders with china.. probably a lot more people doing that than anything out of those official 4x/24s. Probably also lots of other wired connections using chinese and south korean address space.. for amongst other reasons south korean conglomerates that outsource to the north.. I If there's any truth to this at all, it's probably related to the large increase in btc volume in south korea.

anx isn't a scam, but since they lost their non HK banking access it's not very useful unless you live in HK and have an HK bank account. Maybe it is possible to withdraw by wire transfer (but afaik fiat deposits are not possible except through a local bank).. I'd just buy back the BTC and withdraw that if I were you.
You can probably fly to HK, visit their office and get the $150 out as cash in HKD though.

there will always be some mining on core... eventually it will unfreeze and start working (might also not even be really noticeable).. s2x will probably persist indefinitely as well.. we're going to have three different bitcoins going forward.. the only question is which one most people will accept.. core has a massive head start.. will it retain the lead? maybe.

nah.. the LN will be on both chains, as well as many other altcoins. Bitcoin original will always be Bitcoin.. it doesn't matter if it has 1megahash and only processes one block every thousand years in a museum.

are you a bot? is it currently possible to deposit USD if you are resident in the USA?

not sure. i suspect it may work, but it is still (afaik) against transferwise's policy and intermediary banks may block it too.. I guess try it and see.. maybe with a small amount first.. although even if it works now, it may not in the future.. probably better to get a fire.com account or maybe a bunq.com one or some other EUR account that's more of a real account.
