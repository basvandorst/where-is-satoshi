Thanks, I'll look into it

Use something other than rasbian
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:32:13
In the UK CeX have BTC ATMs in certain stores
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:30:00
Thanks for keeping an open mind
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:36:00
Well, I can give you $100 for them right now :p
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:57:14
Lot's of interesting discussions over at HN, sadly some real.knuckle draggers around here don't seem capable.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:31:23
Read the coinbase documentation on fees and transfers

Sidebar -&gt; Read their sidebar before posting
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:23:31
So all of this was explained to you when you posted 4 hours ago:
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:20:13
For what?
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:14:48
Bitcoin ATM's exist. Insert cash, get BTC instantly. Also localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:54:24
Here's help, do bare minimum research. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:16:11


Do as I say, not as I do? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:18:02


This must be a common occurrence for you


Not sure if this is simply terrible English or an attempt at a rap. Do some research regarding BTC trades via PayPal.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:43:54
Zero per day.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:31:07
Apparently reading 4chan.org/biz and reading.some shit postings on reddit is the definition of research these days.
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:15:02
Trading with PayPal is notoriously bad for this sort of thing, I mean, you're not selling beanie babys
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:22:19
I don't think you know what that word means.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:02:31
2600 accept bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:06:03
Faucets are a waste of time.casinos, the house always wins. also, read the sidebar
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:13:45
Post the ROM, I have an emulator on.my phone
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:42:59
Yes/no. Pick one.
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:09:00
Don't, you'll never earn anything. Obviously you've not bothered to do any research.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:27:30


Reality. You'll never make what you'll put in.
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:40:20
180% return a month, asks if its a scam :/
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:23:04
Exactly. Try going to an ATM without having jumped thru the hoops of having setup a bank account. Nothing will happen when you get there.
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:18:22
The sub and the post is about bitcoin, but thanks for missing the point. By your argument posts asking how to trade sexual favours for BTC word be on topic.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:56:44
Cloud mining == scam
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:06:55


Read the links in the sidebar, learn the basics of what you've jumped into with little or no research. Calm down.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:45:40
If only there was a way to search this site...
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:38:35
Talk about missing the point.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:34:11
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:29:31
You'll be lucky to find someone daft enough to accept PayPal for btc.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:35:59
Sure,.why not?
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:45:57
Didn't read the sidebar eh?
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:20:40
You know what they say about making assumptions.
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:56:04
Weaponised exploits, bugs the could have reported years ago that the vendors could have patched. Yeah, they should be on the hook for this.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:13:55
Read the documentation, understand the technology, do a lot of research?
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:28:06

What did poloniex say when you contacted them?
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:19:49
You're now not sure if you're laughing out loud? Seek help
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:55:37
I'm lookin for about three fiddy
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:29:22
Zero research, zero reading, zero clue. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:22:04


I want to mine with my first gen raspberry pi. How many thousand $ will I make a day, and is blockchain.info still the best place to store my billions?
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:30:57
Basic logic. If mining was profitable for them, why would they offer it as a service and not just keep the coins?
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:15:02


Sure, but you have to jump thru hoops and become part of their system, agreeing to their control over all of your finances. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:47:44
I'm sure you've earned a fortune via this route, congratulations
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:00:07
People are weak
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:05:05
I know, but the sub has been inundated with posts like this, shitposting and genuinely clueless alike:
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:16:31
No. How could you tell?
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:37:44
Always have an exit plan
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:33:04
Why not ask the people on Facebook what the hell they're talking about? Then delete your Facebook.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:05:08
Do you own a bitcoind cart for the n64? Do you know where I can download one?
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:38:49
Then why use them if they won't let you use your money for what you want?
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:06:54
Yes, but you clearly don't know anything about either viri or bitcoin, as you'd make no money out of this, and likely go to jail.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:43:42
That doesn't mean the coins are "lost", or that surveys are in any way accurate. You have zero evidence to tell what a lost coin is. A coin not moving for years is evidence nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:59:04
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:43:06
So, mining altcoin not bitcoin, not relevant to thisnpost or the sub?
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:34:13
Or not buy drugs
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:34:28


What did coinbase say when you asked them?
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:27:00
You can't understand anything anyone tells you, why would anyone trust you on what has been explained is a risky trade?
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:10:42
You must have been busy
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:20:48


@_date: 2017-05-24 18:21:23
Sure, why not
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:38:08
The link was to a.discussion about the article, you've admittedly not read the article based upon who wrote it. The definition of a closed mind.

Avoid blockchain.info at all costs
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:09:00
The chicken bones now tell me the same thing that the tea leaves and crystal ball report. 3 minutes left, the bitcoin is dead, again.
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:59:17
I have a server that I'm happy to run some cracking tools (dictionary attack and brute force) for as long as it takes. The server isnt top of the line. Looking into my GPU options at the moment.
**edit** looks like I can dedicate one low end (compared to current top of the line) GPU and a few more CPU cores to this effort
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:33:15
We've got an Internet tough guy here folks, careful guys!
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:08:29
Blockchain.info are awful.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:32:30
Questions about mining alt coins are.off topic here
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:10:41
Green address are OK, I'd avoid a web based wallet
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:25:16


Finally, a user friendly solution
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:18:29
Low grade shitposting

In Glasgow, the fee is around 2%. Your post says there's no quick way. This is almost instant, you'll always pay a premium for "quick" ways of doing things
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:04:50
Sounds like you've found the perfect person to emulate
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:43:48
Hilarious scam site, literally ripped using a mirroring tool from another scam site. Claims to upload exploits to the blockchain, send .019 BTC to cover the 'tx fee' to get your 2 btc
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:12:26
Don't use blockchain.info in future

Wow, this gets asked literally every few days, if only they had a way to search reddit
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:32:56


Why are you using them if you're 'uneasy' even considering talking to them?
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:21:25
You're mining whatever nicehash tell you, they pay you in BTC. It's an altcoin mining system, also go fuck yourself
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:28:58
Obviously not, your reposted scam has been removed, just like the last time you posted a few hours ago.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:18:47
Believe it or not, spending some and holding.

Didn't read the sidebar? -&gt; @_date: 2017-05-28 08:31:30
You don't want more info, you want to be spoonfed an answer. You've ignored the sidebar and clearly done no research
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:44:23
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:11:47
Alt coin, why is this  relevant to this sub?
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:32:28
Reported, read the sidebar
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:22:09
Keep shit posting, it makes you look like a sane person to deal with financially over the internet
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:20:37
How would they be able to tell if a coin was lost?
