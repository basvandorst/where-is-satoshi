I can't just get a warning though? I never actually played poker. I just mentioned that I was thinking of starting some of that on the side for fun.

You still have to pay income tax in Bitcoin whenever you want to spend the Bitcoin.

It doesn't matter. If it's illegal, miners wouldn't be able to legally operate in the states without complying, and they would be subject to audits.

It just doesn't make a good parallel is all I'm saying. Swiss bank accounts are legal.

It wasn't a personal private note field it was information to fill out for them to read. It has nothing to do with using them as a wallet, though that's something you should never do. It's not like they froze the bitcoin I have in there.

I think statements like this show both that the Bitcoin community as a whole is both ill-intentioned and maliciously malcontent, which wouldn't be annoying if they weren't constantly martyring themselves. 
The point and value of Bitcoin is lost on most of the community here.

I think you're just supposed to know everything that happens in the Bitcoin world already and just come here to gossip about it, from what I've gathered. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:26:20
lol but it was only like that for a few days...You decided to buy at the all time market cap high
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:13:26
Isn't it just a joke of a currency that overinflates the market because it's just a joke? Because of its popularity it gained a large market cap which is still growing but the actual value of the doge itself is laughable in that anyone who's invested lots of money in it has lost bigtime. The protocol is just tweaked Bitcoin protocol.

@_date: 2017-01-19 13:21:15
When their servers were going through some issues a couple of weeks ago, I had sent a bitcoin to be converted to Monero. It didn't go through so I clicked it again and it still didn't go through. Then, a bit later, both transactions went through and I sent 2 bitcoin to a Monero conversion site that didn't have support for returns. I didn't have a way to convert it back at the time, and I was upset that a Coinbase wallet allowed a double spend.
Well, they've refunded me a whole bitcoin, which is pretty amazing of them. Thank you, Coinbase!!!
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:35:18
Sounds like you buy high. You should probably stop "playing" this market. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 06:27:19
You're a real shitbag, you know that? Accuse me of gambling for playing the market or call it investing. Don't just say whatever the shittiest thing you can think of at any given moment is. kys

@_date: 2017-01-07 02:48:19
Yeah, sell low, buy high. You're quite the investor!

Hard because everyone in China wants their money out of it. Vastly rich Chinese have to jump through hoops to send money to America. It's the entire reason there was the first bubble to begin with, and it's most of the reason we're going through one now. It's mostly coming from China.

But how do we know it's legit cold storage and the owners aren't just sending themselves the private keys? I'm not accusing them, I'm just curious how possible it would be for them to do that. MtGox was very "secure" at one point too. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:48:36
To split more hairs, it's quite tacky to blab out your net worth to people. It's nothing new to put value on something so small. A debit card can be connected to bank accounts with far more value. This is just a humblebrag.

@_date: 2016-12-28 13:31:54
Maybe, but they keep saying that, so I'm not sure why nothing has been implemented. Makes me think it may never be. As of now I have to wait 10 minutes sometimes for a single confirmation. It makes me think this is not an alternative to a currency I can actually actively use and more of an investment.

Hahaha I'll let you know if the second one ends up being a scam, but obviously yeah, I'm the one posting it. I'm finding this on multiple other threads on reddit though. 
Testing the second link and I got an instant notification when I sent the bitcoin. I lost 70 bucks testing out the first one. That's what I get for testing it with $70 with of bitcoin  &gt;.&lt;

The thing is, these companies take risks to accept fiat currency in exchange for bitcoin. They've all been burned for thousands if not millions of dollars. They can't just accept money from random trustless people as they get scammed.

They also cancelled a few buy orders I made recently. I honestly think this is a MtGox situation where they don't have what they promise and it's only a matter of time before it leaks how fucked they are.

What makes those better? How do we know CoPay or Electrum don't send private keys to their own private servers? Not trying to troll, literally just trying to be informed so that I can answer people who ask me these questions. Even if something is "open-sourced" is there a possibility that the code they show publicly is altered when being released for download on devices?

Well I'm looking up the comparison of value. One Yuan is worth $0.14, so it seems all of this chatter about it being worth $1000 is over-hyped / misinformed? Seems like their value is around $969 which is good but not enough to be worth the quick day trade.

Not everyone here thinks of bitcoin as a money replacement. Some of us are just diversifying. I look at my bitcoin investments in the same way I look at gold investments.

If those coins were lost before the cap, then the original market cap high would be higher as well.

@_date: 2016-12-28 20:36:54
But you're asking how much you have to invest to have a million dollars when bitcoin is worth 10,000...so you just have to divide a million by 10,000...it's extremely basic...
@_date: 2016-12-13 19:52:15
Actually, no, it doesn't tell you how much it would cost you to buy every bitcoin. It doesn't work that way.
It's about how it compares to other economies. It's the value of the economy as a whole in comparison to other economies, and I'm simply pointing out that value is just about up to where it was during its biggest value in history.

So just party for the sake of partying. It's not like someone who invests in an amazing stock needs to party with others who invested in that same stock ;)

Being in a bubble doesn't mean it's the highest it will ever be. It simply means it's higher than it's currently worth based on actual interest of supply and demand versus the manipulation of value with misconstrued or manipulated supply and demand. 
We may or may not be in a bubble, but I hope we are. I'm not done investing.

Good, anything to cut the circlejerking here down in the slightest so we could get something with information for once would be fantastic.

It's more about the value of the economy as a whole. The US is worth over 60 trillion. It's interesting to compare and show the potential there still is.

If I worked at a place that a big chunk of my salary was in tips I'd be pretty fucking pissed to get a dollar on a bitcoin wallet, and I own and know how to sell Bitcoin. Imagine someone just finding out about it. You're giving them more work to cash in their money than the work they are even doing to earn it.

But that's not what irony means.

Looks like a Bitcoin market in CNY
What's CNY? Stands for Chinese Yuan Renminbi
It's the Yuan. It's Chinese money. One Yuan is just over $0.14 so if it's selling for 7000 on Huobi, it's worth about $1000 in USD in direct conversion.
Why don't people just buy in China and sell in the US? Because it's hard to do.

Check the public wallet on blockchain.info to see if there's any transaction pending. Did you pay cash?

I always sort of looked at Bitcoin as a way of diversifying your portfolio in case a huge recession happens. Not that it's recession-proof, but it doesn't only ever follow what's happening with the USD, and that's a good thing.
However, I could understand why this wouldn't be an issue for the ultra wealthy as they're probably already diversified with so many assets that it just seems like a waste of time to take a risky volatile crypto currency that they'd have to dedicate a lot of time to fully understand. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:18:44
Just tumble your coins if you want anonymity. Or mine them.

@_date: 2016-02-11 22:36:37
So it's basically a decision being made outside of the counsel that would normally decide these things? I guess I'm just curious why Coinbase moving to this matters. Are they sort of strong-arming this decision? 
@_date: 2016-02-11 22:13:30


Is this everyone on both side's interpretation of what would happen? And coins would not be able to switch after they are on another side of a fork?
@_date: 2018-04-10 09:07:16
Of course this becomes the top comment and the post goes to zero. This subreddit feels like a propaganda machine. I wish there could be a discussion.

I guess what I'm wondering is, why can't we already upgrade it to quantum proof encryption protocol? Is it because it is only theoretical? Is it only a theoretical encryption protocol that would require quantum computers to function?

On one hand it's comforting to know that in the event of a huge problem, a hard fork could be made of the system before the incident happens. On another, it's a bit frightening that the incident has the potential to link so many public keys to private keys that even a fork at that point might be after too much damage has been done.

What's the difference between BTC tanking and coming up again and BCC tanking and coming up again? Why is this sub so anti BCC? I legit can not find viable answers in this sub.

Bet you miss that price now xD
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:30:24
For bitcoin you need to ask tons of people to confirm your transaction multiple times before it goes through, AND you have to pay them for it. I've never had to pay venmo anything...
Don't delete your comments, keep the discussion open
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:57:53
Its anonymous if you bought your bitcoin illegally.

Thanks for the info, looking into Glidera

oh gemini just went completely down, good timing lol
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:09:55
It's illegal if there's no record, because you have to pay taxes on profits if you ever sell, or purchase anything with it.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:33:07
God damn this website is slow af
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:25:35
Shouldn't you? You think I'm attacking bitcoin but I'm just here for a discussion. But if you want to just attack me then why don't you go out to recess with the other children and let the grown-ups talk.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:32:55
Not a negative bias towards bitcoin, just the sensationalism behind it. I love bitcoin, I just don't love it for the reasons most people seem to here. 
So what you're saying is the technological win for bitcoin is the ability to send a ton of money for cheap/quickly. That's a good argument. So for people with millions of dollars it's great. 
The security of it is good too. If you're responsible enough, your bitcoin should be safe. 
I suggest you don't make assumptions about my intent.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:19:55
Will do tonight, thanks
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:13:12
Neither cash nor bitcoin is illegal. The means at which you receive it can be illegal if you don't follow the law. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:18:19
Great post! Will look into that channel as well. Thank you for answering so thoroughly and intelligently. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:46:30
I'm not saying they automatically do, I'm saying to stay legal this is what would happen. You would need to prove when you got the bitcoin in order to post it on your taxes for when you purchase anything with them or sell them. I've spoken to accountants about it. 
Not trying to pick a fight but you sure are coming in with some weird sense of aggression. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:20:17
Actually then you get audited and have to prove a source of the bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:26:18
I don't need to ask anyone to send them money through any of those. I just need to know their address. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:34:41
That's just because the value has gone up though. If you pick a date where bitcoin was worth more and moved it out when it was worth less that argument wouldn't be valid. Like if you bought 10 bitcoin during the high yesterday and sold them now, you'd be down a thousand bucks. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:33:07
This seems like the most reasonable answer.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:40:21
I wonder why they don't advertise for gemini on their twitter pages
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:17:51
