Fine, but give your bitcoins to me first, so I can pray over them and make them holy with the power of Satoshi, then I will give them back to you:

And hopefully this is the start of a very long road of lessening the influence of governments, banks and the Obamas/Putins of the world.

Why? How is politics somehow necessary for human society?  Its not.  Anarchism is not 'chaos' and OMG Let's throw molotov cocktails!
Filling a pothole with a couple neighbors because your shitty, corrupt worthless local government won't is Anarchsim.

Government is not needed.  An anarchic future is the only sustainable situation for humans.  OP needs to break free of a limited paradigm.

I am an anarchist that embraces markets, but I am not an anarcho-capitalist.  So I wouldn't say free markets take care of everything with the enthusiasm you do, if nothing else simply because we do not know everything.
Regardless, a problem is the term "Free Market" itself.  No such thing exists, nor has it ever, in the United States, yet people like to throw it around and think it can actually exist with a government.  Any market that does exist is simply titled in favor of whichever political party is in power &amp; their corporate masters.

I understand the sentiment but not the practicality of statements like yours:  The government has plenty of more lead to make you suck on than you ever would have for them to suck on.

I'll donate all my bitcoin to him if he renounces politics and embraces anarchism.

What...are we doing?

You know, I will not be surprised in the slightest if you are 100% correct.

My point is they *are* 'hellbent on massive wealth accumulation through world destruction' and you can group them together as the 'Military Industrial Complex' (please don't take me for a conspiratard-illuminati spewing type person, this has nothing to do with that kind of thing).
If one wanted to, one could call it something else, or consider the whole shebang in different groupings and its all the same stuff.  Nevermind, its not that big of a deal, we're all just fucked.

Holy shit, thanks!

Thomas Jefferson would go fuck his slave. Everyone needs to stop invoking the businessmen who wanted political power to match their economic power who started the U.S. as some kind of demigods.

Then give me the ability to put my taxes only where I think they should go.
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:34:03
Shit I hope you're correct.

But first their going to convince a majority of the electorate how important patriotism is and if they don't give support central government they = Satan. 
This will happen first, and it'll be shitty. Just look at the Bush years, I couldn't objectively talk about anyone about how fucking stupid, wrong and evil the Iraq war is. And then because I'm not on the left or right, the left would give me shit too. Truth is, we're all just fucked and their is no hope.

The answer lies in an anarchic society, not another political party.
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:52:53
That's right! And because you are currently not in a Free Speech Zone you won a free trip to a CIA prison black site!

The problem is the paradigm most people are thinking from.  "Crazy Libertarians" isn't it, its a natural anarchic evolution.  Yes, anarchism.  I'm refered to as a "crazy libertarian" because people, like Wang, haven't let their minds understand anarchism.  Which isn't really done overnight, nor done by arguing on the internet.  It takes time, perhaps somewhat similar to going from being a devout member of an organized religion to an agnostic.

Oh its ok, I'm sure we'll be bringing "freedom" to you soon!
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:58:14
Yes because the Armed Forces, the private companies that supply them everything from body bags to satellites, the congress that will chop off their own dicks at a chance to look good blindly supporting the military - all those people have 'the people's' interest at heart and absolutely are not hellbent on colluding to destroy everything in their path for their own gain.

You forgot the giant shit they took on the 4th too.
