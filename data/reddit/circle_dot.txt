He did mention a majority was sold at the $100 price range. But it was also stated that they "declined to say how much" they had left. This usually means a substantial amount is left. If it were a couple coins or a few $100, they would have said so.

This is capitulation. It happens in every market for any number of reasons. There will always be weak hands in the market and as adoption spreads, the weak will gave less influence on daily movement. BTC had a hell of a run last year and will most likely trade in that range for the next few months until the institutional money starts hopping in.

If bitcoin is going to change the world, it will not be because these guys did anything for it. They are using it to their own advantage.
Yes, I believe in the protocol and it does have the ability to change things. It not going to happen overnight and it's certainly not going to happen because a bunch of BitRich people are spouting about how great it is while raking in dough from it. Once it becomes practical for the every day person, it will fly. Until then, it is a game and these guys like Winklevoss' will cash out and walk away when they made a certain percentage off their investment and won't give two shits after.

BTC is a possession and BFL was providing a service in exchange for your possession. BTC being recognized as a currency does not matter.  BFL made an agreement to give customers a product in exchange for BTC. If they breached that agreement in someway that breaks commerce laws, then a fine can be imposed. It could also be found to be fraud of some type. 
Say I have a new 3D printer I am building and I go to you and say I will trade it for your Honda Dirt Bike but you have to give me the bike now and I will give you the 3D printer when assembled. Do you think I am exempt from maintaining my side of the bargain? What if I procrastinate a year and 3D printers all of a sudden become $100 items and the dirt bike depreciated because of time and 5k miles I put on it?

If you believe when Ghash gets over 51% they will do some shady shit, then Bitcoin is flawed and everyone should mine a different coin.

An internet connection is needed for the P2P network right? So it could be centralized around that. Couldn't it? I mean the government through ISP's could disrupt BTC. Also, since everyone lives in some kind of country with laws and regulations, what you do with BTC outside of its network is subject to Centralization no matter what. 
Can we stop with the blanket decentralization claims of BTC?  A decentralized network that operates within a centralized network is not decentralized.

No he didn't. Read his post over at Bitcointalk. He said he keeps all his coins in an offline wallet in a safety deposit box for his heirs to inherit.  
I am beginning to think this guy is the real Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:55:43
So what you are saying is "Lost my wallet with a picture of my safe deposit box. See, safe deposit boxes are so much more secure than cash, credit/debit cards. "
If you are carrying an encrypted form of bitcoin, it is not a true wallet residing thing which makes you full of shit since you would need some way(technology) to decrypt and spend it.
If you said, "I lost my wallet with my cash and cards and my phone which had my access to bitcoins.." you would be making a valid point of how you could still get access to your coins elsewhere and no one else could. But carrying around paper form of encrypted bitcoins in your wallet just sounds straight up retarded.

Do you know how much hash rate would have to fall to get 30 minute blocks? It's not an arbitrary number.  Difficulty corresponds to hash rate. The hash rate would have to plummet while difficulty is still high, and that will only last 2016 blocks at the most until it re-targets to a difficulty based on the current hash rate that will produce a block every ten minutes. 
The downfall of bitcoin is not the mining/data centers or pools (although could be a catalyst),mother downfall is the 10 minute blocks. Bitshares has 10 second blocks and is scalable up to 10k TPS.  Bitcoin would need a hard fork now to keep up in the long run. The longer they wait to fix those problems, the harder it will be for people to accept the hard fork and then you have multiple BTC chains.

I've thought about that with other technology too. Especially Cd's. Invented in the late 70's, marketed to the public in the early 80's, in every household by the early 90's, and now fading away to be completely replaced by digitally store music files.

I thought so too until doing research over the past month. There are many coincidences or clues that point to Hal being Satoshi. For example: Hal's Bitcointalk account was created 13 days before Satoshis final post, one of Hal's early posts says he is "new to the code" when he was there 1 1/2 years earlier during the first week of bitcoin and well versed in pow and cryptography, admitting he had a lot of coins in a safety deposit for his heirs during a time when BTC was sub $100, his ALS starts to get worse during Satoshis final days........ And so on.
What makes me not think Hal is Satoshi is that Hal had public correspondence with Satoshi on Sourceforge in the beginning and also private email correspondence too. 
I know lots of people create multiple profiles and use them as if they were someone else (see Reddit), but Hal would have had to decide to use the alias Satoshi and then plan out his correspondence with himself. The more I type this, the more I am starting to think Hal is Satoshi now. After all, Hal was into the cryptography which probably bread paranoia going back to the beginning and I could totally see someone in that field going paranoid and creating a false image while at the same time trying to establish an alibi or degree of separation for the real him. Hmmmm. I imagine, the only way we will know for sure is if Hal passes, which I certainly hope does not happen, and the "Satoshi coins" will start to be moved shortly after by his heirs.

Shame on you! You should've known the possibility of this happening. You even said it yourself, "another scam".  Doesn't make it right, but come on man. Get your refund and buy coins. I have never made money mining coins over the past 6 months. 2 times I have bought miners, mined for a bit and sold once I realized first hand the non-profitable ways of mining these days.

Bitcoin has a variable called Difficulty, which is basically a measure or the networks Hash rate. Hash rate is a measure of the amount of mining/computing that's happening. So the more people that mine Bitcoins, the harder it gets to mine them. This adjustment happens roughly every 10 days. Lately difficulty has been increasing 20-30% every ten days.  This makes your mining output and profitability fall if you don't add more mining power. What is yielding you 1 bitcoin today could only yield you .7 bitcoins 10 days from now if current trend continue. The only saving grace to continue mining after so long is if price continued to rise and equip and power costs don't exceed the coin price. But like gambling, people are always willing to mine at a loss. The dream of what BTC could be makes people do silly things.

So what's the difference from having a "true" debit card (not a check card)?  A debit card is far more widely accepted than BTC.

I really don't think you understand what BitsharesX is doing.  Pegging something to the dollar isn't price fixing. If Bitshares was trying to say 5 BTSX is always 1 bitUSD, then that would be price fixing. Right now 31 BTSX equal $1 and it will take you 31 BTSX to get a bitUSD. If tomorrow, BTSX drops by 66%, ~100 BTSX will equal 1 bitUSD and 1 bitUSD will equal $1.

All I am saying is that in the grand picture Bitcoin is not decentralized.  The protocol by itself is designed to be decentralized but since it operates within the boundaries of governments it is not. The protocol distributes its functions away from a centralized entity but is still subject to an overlying authority, your local government.  A government could easily say the Bitcoin network is completely legal to operate but at the same time say its illegal to use the coin as a currency and illegal to convert the coin to a state money or tax the hell out of the conversion.  Bitcoin will be regulated. It skirts around Anti money-laundering laws and tax laws, and governments don't like that. I wish it wouldn't end up that way, but we would have to live in a state of anarchy to achieve complete decentralization.

You probably have a higher interest rate to pull cash off your card and lower limits than the credit limit. They probably think you are buying BTC with credit and turning them into cash as a way to bypass their cash withdraw interest and fees. They are probably well within their right to do so regardless. 
Big banks suck, but what the fuck are you doing buying BTC with credit? 
You probably are a higher risk and they properly identified it. No offense.

I am not saying that BTC doesn't have consensus compared to the dollar. I am saying it does and so does Bcash because they have more than 1 user each that agree on the terms of using them
The dollar is a currency. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. They are very much comparable. It's like comparing gala apples to fuji apples to granny smiths actually. They are all apples and the consensus on which one is better all depends on who you talk to.
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:09:36

@_date: 2018-04-27 13:17:34
Consensus means a general agreement. You and I can have a consensus on any given topic and everyone else in the world not be a part of it or agree. Bcash users have their consensus and BTC users have theirs. It really isn't a hard concept to understand. If you don't agree with that then BTC doesn't have consensus when compared to the dollar and is thus as inferior to the dollar as Bcash is to BTC.
