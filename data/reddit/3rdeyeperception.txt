But as a corporation, aren't they a bit protected if btc to fiat declines, as they can use the losses as tax write-offs and just use it as a tool to offset future gains.

Hodling is a way to burn away your investment.
Having exit and entry points is a good way to make sure you're not losing too much money

Purse.io is a decent marketplace according to a few people that I've met
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:25:22
I agree.
That's why I say hodling is stupid.
You never see people trading any other asset and lose 80 percent and scream " hodl"
Btc definitely attracts a young, unrealistic crowd at times.

Buying btc is best at local face to face meet ups.
There are various cold wallet storage options available now, but make sure you buy directly from the manufacturer. Never open package. Never used.

And all the times I held alts when they hit ath and then it dropped 90 percent
Think neo ( I could have retired if I hadn't screwed that one up so bad )

Hardware wallet have reputations for a reason, a persistent os on a thumb drive seems pretty hackable to me
As far as wallet features, id say update and keep up to date with whichever has the best track record of not getting hacked that gives you your private keys

I know a guy. His exist plan was $1,000,000
He worked in different crypto companies and did every ico possible.
He never had an exit point, he just used around 40,000 a year to pay for computers and miners and random things.
I asked him if he had any stop loss set, as the ATH was kicking in and I worried what he would do if things went South 
Btc went from what... $20,000 to $4,000, and alts bled even worse ?
With a stop loss, he would have been able to pull out and if he wanted, get 5x the amount of btc he held, or cashed out and lived comfortably

I would put orders in on random alts for 10 percent of their value
I made decent cash in it way back when
Mostly with random weed coins because eventually a celebrity would wear their shit and it would moon for a bit and then people would sell and forget a 0 after their decimal point
Instant profit

Sending btc from an external wallet is probably the easiest way around your current problem

We do however live in a world where the cities don't ha e granaries and gardens for us to eat in, or even vast land tracks to hunt it.
Instead we have cold, dead space and cold, dead food we pay other people to warm up for us.
Such is life, for most.
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:07:56
I always recommend trying Bitcoin meet up groups / 2600 meetings, or anywhere where you can do face to face
Most major cities seem to have at least a few Bitcoin groups
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:27:57
I hear that either it will moon, as it's done before, or the drab response of " it's already been priced in "
All I know is it's not big value now for it to change my life significantly if I sold or if it goes to zero, so ill just hang out for another few years and see what happens
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:29:33
I'd recommend some alt trading, low value alts.
So that if you lose anything it's insignificant, and once you're use to it you can apply your trading strategies to more expensive assets like Bitcoin.
I use gunbot for automated trading as I'm too busy with school to still day trade.
Might be worth something looking into.

It's help me panic sell when markets suddenly drop so that I only lose a small bit of holdings versus a huge portion of my holdings, especially since this year has been so volatile

If you believe in it's long-term viability as a form of commerce, yes, though I wouldn't spend any more of my money on it. Perhaps do some random odds and ends gigs for it and then sit on your btc for a few years, that way you have only a small bit of financial exposure if it happens to depreciate.
