I'm Hodling and don't care. The money was there and I am willing to loose it I can make it back. Just wished I didn't put so much in it at 13-14k and put all the money I did right now.

Like I said 2 weeks. I known about it since I was 17 and it was worth 250 and wanted to invest then but couldn't forgot about it then been thinking about for the past 2 years and now am 21 and just invested last Saturday  wish I would've bought back before like everyone but now I have 1,900 in profit on Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum in just 1 week. 
2 weeks is very short if you would've been following them here and there you'd see it took forever to go up in price and 2 weeks goes up 10gs to hit 20gs QUICK AF

I kinda regret spending so much on it when I look at my savings but I know at any time if I wanted I can get my money back and profit. So it's mentally exhausting because of how much I have in my savings now then before but I know if I'll hodl I should never regret it

Well we know it's only up from here and what I lose I know I'll make back no matter how long it takes so double up or nothing is my advice.

I don't own bitcoins and they're too much now to just fork out 10k for
