Fair enough. I disagree strongly with your assertion that capitalism is the best educational system available.
@_date: 2015-12-23 19:18:52
If that's your level of argument I'm not surprised you think everyone is stupid. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:32:04
It's the opposite of your point. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:11:37
Being unenforceable doesn't seem to bother anyone. Look at the "wars" on drugs and piracy.
@_date: 2015-12-23 18:32:41
.... I'm not sure if you agree or disagree with my comment?

Most people can handle calculus under the right circumstances, if they had inclination, time and quality teaching.

A product or service. So not, you know, content? No one would ever want a website for entertainment or information :l

That crack is very moreish

Quick question, I am interested in bitcoin as a currency rather than a commodity, what would actually happen if the price never rose again, would it collapse?
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:21:47
Who so is the guy that tipped nearly 1k USD in dogecoin!?
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:47:40
And you have actually cashed out? Like, with dollars or whatever into your bank account?
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:27:27
Hell, hopefully. Seriously one of the stupidest posts I've ever seen on this site.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:31:37
Is it possible for you to actually withdraw 12k from it or would that cause some sort of market crash? Or is it practically impossible anyway? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:07:17


Right well off you go and fix them so. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:57:11
Man, what age are you? How could a website not be user driven? 
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:08:33
Half this thread is only here for the fireworks
@_date: 2014-08-15 11:25:04
How about that free pizza guy?
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:23:39
Why are you getting downvoted? Are these lies? I assume so but don't know enough to back that up.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:27:04
WHAT. How? Why? Do people really have that much dogecoin? Is it actually liquid?
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:31:32
What was his rational for that?
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:34:24
? Seriously? If your website is a business then of course you want to make money from it. Do you think the servers you are using to post on reddit are free? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:13:27
Well no offense but that's basically a non point. You're making a broad implication then weasiling out of defending it by hiding behind literality. It's like saying "i don't know why every black guy is pissed off that I'm suspicious of them" and then pointing out that you meant "every" literally and you once saw someone with a gang tat.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:38:02
Right well people hate paywalls even more than they hate ads. You can forget about reddit gold, as reddit would not be viable without ads and it's not clear if it is viable even *with* them and paid porn will presumable go the way of the dodo once the golden generation realises that the hub sites exist. Netflix is the only successful subscription service I can think of, there may be one or two more that I'm not aware of but not more than that. In the internet as we know it advertising is the only proven method of making money without shipping a traditional product for cash.

I would guess the sex trade that the Czech rep is famous for. But I could be wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:27:27
Yanno, I was actually hoping for someone to chime in with some info. Disappointing. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:04:26
Interesting that no one want's to hazard a guess as to why. I can think of one reason.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:34:34
But is it good for bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:42:51
THAT'S NOT WHAT A SHADOWBAN IS
@_date: 2016-10-14 21:41:07
Lol your poor uncle. Someone should tell him there's a middle ground :)
@_date: 2016-10-14 21:18:16
Yeah well getting your money from an ATM at HSBC or whatever is not the same thing, not really relevant to this discussion. Now, if you got your Taiwanese dollars from some dude on a corner with a binbag full of cash that would be more like it. 
By the way, how did you like Taiwan? I've only heard good things, it's top of my list for east Asia right now.
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:47:45
Huh. Seems like 3k would be enough for a month, flights included. Very tempting!
@_date: 2016-10-14 21:16:23
How did you get to the hotel?
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:22:35
One is the tourist currency right?
@_date: 2016-10-14 21:15:51
@_date: 2016-10-14 15:56:58
How are you going to visit a country for the first time with absolutely zero familiarity with their currency? You wouldn't find out the exchange rate and get some money changed before you get on the plane? Nonsense. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 01:42:46
Sounds amazing. Would you think there is any possibility of organising work for a month or two, or should I just go over and enjoy the holiday? 
@_date: 2016-05-20 14:13:21
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:01:13
Wow it's lucky that the cost of living also dropped 8%

He has lots of ground to stand on. The ground is made of facts, and the facts are those bankers *were* found guilty. And they were fined. At worst.
