I use both GDAX and Gemini, and while I hate Coinbase’s business practices (company behind GDAX exchange) their interface for trading and site speed is the best today.  Gemini is best for wiring money in...I use Wells Fargo wires and wiring into Gemini has been taking under two hours which is great.  I can provide a lot of other advice based on my own experience (use a Ledger Nano Hardware Wallet with passphrase.....keep your 24 word seed in a different location, preferably a bank safety deposit box...).

I emailed NIST here in Boulder Colorado about the inaccuracy of the 'draft' document people are referencing this 'Bcash' statement and they have since correct it. Here's the email I received yesterday;
From: dylan.yaga
Thank you for your comments.
You, along with many others, expressed concern on section 8.1.2.
To help foster a full transparency approach on the editing of this section, I am sending the revised section to you for further comment.
 
8.1.2      Bitcoin Cash (BCH or BCC1)
In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated Witness (known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data) through a soft fork. SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more efficient form.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve – and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to increase the maximum blocksize (additionally the developers made changes to other aspects of the system, such as the difficulty adjustment algorithm). When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
 
1The ticker used for Bitcoin Cash differs depending on the exchange; some use BCH, some BCC

Yup... and it's important to remove bullshit when we see it otherwise its weaponized against us... If this had remained they'd get some dickhead from MSNBC to read the draft and then because he's looking for clicks to further his own position he makes a big bold headline... then other media outlets repeat it... It's like Fake Bitcoin News...

So what you're saying is if ten miners out of ten thousand decided to not accept a soft fork and did their own hard fork then they get to claim they are the 'real Bitcoin'?  If it works that way I'll go fork BCash tonight and start spamming the world that mine is now the real thing....

Okay, your entitled to ur opinion but I gotta ask... if you really feel that way then why the fuck are you even reading the sub reddit?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:15:46
To all.  I appreciate that you read my theory and posted your responses, support and critiques. To be honest it was written after a bottle (or two) of red wine and a a full day of stressful crypto-market tracking but.. I still feel it's 90% likely the case.  Even those of you who were a bit harsh I applaud as critical discussion is what I wanted to generate (not just a bunch of "Yeah, Fuck Roger..." support).  
A few responses to the common objections found in this thread:
{We crashed because it was due... it's the end of year profit taking... Korea had a hacking...}
I completely agree that all of this and more played into the severity but I'd also suggest these things made the timing of the attack that much better for those doing the attacking.  Just too many coincidences to ignore.
{If this was true then why did BCH also crash...?}
It didn't during the first 24 hours of the attack... it wasn't until BTC fell enough and the panic hit that all other coins including BCH started to dive in concert.  I think they underestimated the panic response or they simply didn't care. If they could bring the ratio of BTC:BCH down that was a win.  
{You must wear a tinfoil hat... this is crazy conspiracy shit...}
Less then 8 years ago we had traders packaging up shitty high-risk mortgages and selling them in the derivative markets while their buddies handed out no-interest/no-document loans like candy...  If that shit could happen in a highly regulated market you don't think people will try to manipulate crypto?
{If this is true, then we're all fucked and your coin sucks cause it wasn't that hard to do...}
I agree.  It actually scares me to think it can happen like this (if it did). I watched a Sell Wall today of 600+ BTC sit on the GDAX Order Book blocking multiple efforts for it to recover and it worked extremely effectively.  That only cost someone $9m which sounds like a lot, but they didn't lose that $9m, they were paid, they just needed to stick it out there to squash every attempt to recover.  Our markets are still too thin... and it's risky as shit. 
And I'd again remind everyone that while we did recover (so far) back to a nice place in terms of where we were 30 days ago, this bullshit has hurt the entire market as a lot of money is now backing out of their expected entry:
$500m Hedge Fund Cancelled

It's halted until the morning but what do you think happens on Coinbase when they just handed out 300,000+ BCH and people see the price took an unrealistic jump today?  At least half of those people will be looking to grab their free money and run. Should be fun to watch.

I expect that a lot of those things worked into the timing, for maximum impact.  Also, every knew we were ripe for a correction.  I'd still suggest that the BCH team used all of that to its advantage...  but as I mentioned, what the fuck do I know :) It's a theory.

He is the co-founder of bitcoin.com along with Roger Vers.  They initially used the bitcoin.com site to make money off Bitcoin but then pivoted to have it bash Bitcoin and promote Bitcoin Cash.  Lots of people are confused when the 'founder of bitcoin.com' says he's selling all of his Bitcoin because it's useless and risky..  That was his entire intention.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:40:54
Not in the beginning.. for the first day of the attack BCH made BIG gains and BTC lost .... it wasn't until we hit a tipping point of panic that they began to lose together.

My 'rage' is because there are 1000+ crypto currencies and none of the others was created by 'copying' another and then publicly attacking it to steal it's market value.  If you want to create a new crypto product fine, but name it something else and pitch the value without stating that BTC is useless... Don't attack the network, don't organize sound bites and media events where you flat out attempt to scare people into selling your rivals coin.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:08:50
Worse, most Coinbase customers were probably not even aware they just received BCH which is now sitting in their accounts ready to sell, but they will be tomorrow.  That 11.5k worth of Sell Orders is going to be a LOT bigger tomorrow.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:33:39
Well said.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:18:13
I agree the panic took hold after the fact and then it fucking spread... but the 48 hours leading up to it was BCH bullshit power plays.  At least in my theory :)

Some valid points and ideas.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:21:33
I fully agree with this.  The only 'advantages; to B Cash are 1) Lower transaction fees and 2) Faster network speeds.  Lightening Network solves both, so better to try and grab as much market value as possible before it hits.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:38:30
Also, GDAX is one of four exchanges used to set the CME Futures Bitcoin Reference Price.  You can complain to them that GDAX was possibly an active or willful participant in price manipulation here gcc . They will then be obligated to report this issue and have it investigated.

Nonsense... exchanges announce new trading pairs all the time, unless they are publicly traded or in the middle of a IPO there's nothing that stops them from announcing new services. That's like saying an automotive manufactuer can't market a new car before it's on the lot ready to sell.

I think you miss the point that market manipulation is bad for all of crypto...Wanting to profit in a fair and balanced marketplace doesn't seem silly to me.  Also, we want mainstream investors, hedge funds, Wall Street.. to bring their money in.  That is being paused now 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:15:07
I agree but the disappointing aspect is that we were just starting to make some good progress with other groups of investors (Wallstreet) and that is a huge benefit in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:46:01
I'd think the better outcome would be Coinbase/GDAX committing to implementation of better anti manipulation controls... such as elimination of order spoofing and monitoring accounts that blatantly dump on pair and pump into another...  They don't give a shit today because they make money on every trade but they signed up for regulatory oversight when they agreed to be part of the CME pricing scheme.

You do realize they've also created a big tax headache for you.  The taxable value is determine when you gained control, which depending on the time of day was somewhere between $3000-$9000.  Assume it was $3000, you made that gain even if you don't sell it, come April 15th you are legally required to disclose and pay the tax man.  You got free money too, so there's an upside... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:47:09
So, again I'm not saying this is all correct, it's theory.. But... the stated goal of BCH is to replace BTC (not in question) and they would like to shift as much market value from BTC t BCH to do that.  Losing millions is not quite the right way to look at it, 'spending millions' is.  They can dump (sell) BTC at a tiny loss and then pump (buy) BCH and they haven't even lost anything, especially if they spread FUD at the same time to help further boost the price of BCH.  Then as BCH rises they sell that, go back and buy discounted BTC and repeat... You could realistically take $50m and work it right to act like $500m...  
I completely agree that part of the market movement was due to end of year profit taking, Russia, Korea... but I also think those things helped create the opportunity and provide the timing.  I assume they also had early knowledge of the Coinbase announcement as the insider leaks seem all but confirmed.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:24:02
I agree...to a point.  We needed the correction but you can't discount the enormous effort and FUD that team BCH put in the day right before and during the dive. At the same time the BTC network was spammed with fake transactions to slow it down (as if it needed to be slower) and someone started dumping BTC and buying BCH...  Smoke doesn't always mean fire but there are a lot of connected dots here. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:34:35
Ha!  I feel the exact same way every time I buy, without fail had I waited an hour (or a day) it would have been far better timing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:00:33
But it’s a covered call... right?  Help me understand....The seller had the 275 BTC and sold a one year option call at  for $1m.  He had to transfer the 275 BTC to LedgerX for escrow.  If the buyer chooses at any time up until Dec 2018 to exercise his option then he pays the seller $50k * 275 (which is on top of the initial $1m) and LedgerX sends him the 275 BTC . Otherwise the option expires and the 275 BTC goes back to the buyer.  At that point he can sell them for whatever BTC is trading for which will likely be above today’s price but below $50k (else the buyer would have bought them).  It seems pretty fucking brilliant to me.  What the downside or risk?  Only if BTC goes  significantly higher then $50k  or possibly if during the next year it went to say $40k and then before the Call expired it dropped down to $20k.

On this I agree...  you can have a conspiracy and other events that impact the situation at the same time.  More then likely it's why the timing was chosen.  I'd point that we had fully regulated bankers packaging up shitty high-risk mortgages while their lender buddies were handing out low interest, no document mortgages like candy... creating one of the biggest market crashes of the century, yet many on this thread think it's crazy talk that a group of shady characters in crypto would attempt to manipulate an unregulated and extremely thin market for their own person profits.

But no one on Coinbase held BCH at the fork.. they took possession today ... and today there was a value per several months of trading by others. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:51:07
No quivering finger of rage here... Just a theory I thought deserved more discussion and consideration. What you wrote is correct and obviously had a major impact on how things played out, but I still believe that the heightening media efforts against BTC, the jump in online FUD... the suspicious dumping of BTC on the first day while BCH was being pumped... Were all using the other and obvious market events to maximize the attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:12:12
I agree... it is 100% conjecture.  But I did feel like there is strong evidence for it and seeing that we have 600+ replies it at the very least generated some interesting discussion. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:05:45
You realize there was more then just a 'Swedish guy on TV'... but agree with your basic point that if it can be manipulated it has issues.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:28:22
Yup... but how do we regulate a decentralized marketplace?  I'd suggest there's a lot that exchanges like GDAX could do, to prevent spoofing of massive orders... review trading practices and the like. But even those wouldn't do much.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:31:49
You may be right.. and he may have chosen the timing to maximize his benefit without orchestrating things to the extent I suggested.  The one aspect that is not really 'provable' is that they were dumping BTC and buying BCH... But it was extremely suspicious even today as BTC was trying to recover on GDAX someone kept a 600+ Sell Wall of orders up about $100 out that slowed the momentum for hours... until it finally fell.  The same but opposite thing was on the BCH Order Book, a 250+ Buy Wall at $2500 (?) providing a floor.  People use Sell/Buy Walls all the time to influence the market but these really stood out.  Possibly just coincidence. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:20:04
Not sure lots of people needed billions for gifts, that can't be wired out of an exchange for 2-3 days...
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:18:42
I don't know if my theory is true, but I also don't think it's quite insanity.   Was it insanity that banks bundled shitty high risk mortgages into derivatives and sold them to make billions and then fuck our economy?  That was all done in a highly regulated and mature market place... So why would this be insanity?  There are billions$ to be made by dethroning BTC with BCH... and it's literally the stated intent and goal of the people (heavily funded and centralized group I might add) that backs BCH.

Trustee then moves BTC from “watched wallet” address and to Broker.  Market take notice but doesn’t immediately respond,,, OTC broker unloads $140m worth if BTC...instantly realizing gains from initial discounted price...BUT both Trustee and broker realize bigger gains from shorts as FUD starts hitting about Mt Gox selling (carefully timed leaks by Broker...) and Stop Loss +Bot sales begin multiplying the drop...  Broker buys back in at 10% lower, plus added capital earned on shorts...   Trustee gets to claim he didn’t sell on spot market.  And because there’s no real regulation, no laws are broken.

Yes..that’s the basic premise.  It’s supposed to be 1:1 tied in value to USD.  The controversy is really whether in fact the issuer does hold exactly 1:1 in their accounts or if they create and issue Tether without the USD matched holding, 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:51:17
Not, it's not fair to assume it's actually the opposite. Do you think the CFTC subpoenas companies, finds fraud and then sits on it?  Honestly they'd probably be happy to bring down crypto as its run by old-school finance folks.  Also, Bitfinex has been proven to have a banking relationship with the Dutch bank ING, who does fairly good due diligence on risk.  
How about this? Until you prove otherwise, it's fair to assume you are a paid FUDster trying to spread rumors and create further panic selling.  I don't think you are but it's the same arguement you just posed spun back on you.

I agree that having definitive proof that A) Tether is solvent would be good, while B) not having definitive proof is bad...but I don’t accept your argument that in the absence of A then B must exist. That’s a classic fallacy.  You’re of course perfectly entitled to your opinions and I’m happy to debate them but you can’t (or more properly “shouldn’t) attack those who don’t hold the same opinion.

Again this doesn't invalidate his research, but his paper is really only infers an already known casual relationships (people buy BTC with USDT when it's price dips), not definitive (USDT was used to manipulate price.).

You understand that they don't 'create it out of thin air'...... people purchase 1:1 tether from them with USD and they then 'release' it after they its fully backed.  Many (many) people have suggested that they might not hold 1:1 USD but that's never been proven and is only speculation that btw the CFTC s*ubpoenaed*  data on back in December and guess what, didn't pursue any actions against Bitfinex.

Forget Libra... or at least forget the ‘Libra Token Backed with a Basket of Fiat’.... the most important point is that FB Libra elevated the discussion of a global digital currency to the highest levels and the outcome of that is an accelerated timeline to move off paper and onto digital.  The benefit to Bitcoin for this can’t be under-estimated, it’s absolutely huge. Think about the markets response the week of Libra’s announcement, what % did we jump?  Now think about what it means when the US announces it’s intention to move (or at least create and support) a digital national currency (i.e. eUSD).  The global implication are absolutely huge, and the market response for Bitcoin will be as huge. If in 5 years 90% of all commerce is conducted using digital wallets, and those can natively support Bitcoin you then have the single largest (and most important) development in finance and Bitcoin possibly ever.

You can literally replace all mentions in the paper of Tether with USD and see if it still holds water... because as long as not one has proof that Tether isn't 1:1 backed, it's the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:21:58
EXACTLY.. if you read the paper the author suggests that there are two groups... Pullers and Pushers of Tether but in reality they are all Pullers using Tether to buy on the dip.  Just because the pullers might be founders or backers of Tether (Bitfinex related folks) doesn't mean they didn't buy it with 1:1 USD and then buy Bitcoin, so no real difference.  They seems to think 'Pushers' just print tether or 'free' and then buy BTC.... but that's never been proven and is not addressed anywhere in his theories.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:14:16
Made it onto New York Times as well....  This was a carefully timed rehash of old news that only establishes 'casual correlation' and is based on the unsubstantiated idea that Tether is not backed 1:1 with USD.  Otherwise the papers theory of two types of Tether users "Pullers and Pushers" really is only one type... buyers.

Regarding the audit, they allowed a limited audit but wouldn't allow the full audit because there's probably  'something' there but my theory is it's 'who' their customers are (maybe North Korea, maybe Goldman Sacks or some South American drug cartel...).

@_date: 2017-11-12 22:53:56
Yes I do.  If you look at the volumes you'll notice that every hour or two as BTC price stabilizes someone short sells a large block, creating a panic effect and triggering stop-loss sales.  The same time the 'idea' that BCH will replace BTC is being pushed helping that coin raise.  There are a lot of us who see the BTC crash as a buying opportunity but guess what, it's being orchestrated on a weekend when banks are closed and it's impossible to wire money. If that wasn't the case you'd see a lot more value buying and price stability for BTC.   
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:45:35
It's highly probable.  I personally believe that the community of developers, investors, believers... behind Bitcoin don't like this power grab approach the Bitcoin Cash team is trying and they have a lot of power/options to fight back. Although, they timed it really nicely,  wait for the Segwit2x fork to cancel (creating confusing), wait for BTC to begin is correction (to start downward momentum) and wait for the weekend (to reduce people buying and stabilizing things more quickly). It's 7am in Hong Kong now, so we'll see how the Asian markets that  control a lot of BTC react.  Btw, even if people don't like the way this is going down, they are still sitting on their hands to see where the BTC bottom lands so when they do 'Buy' it's as profitable as possible. I know I am.

Many of us would like to buy BTC as it's price is falling but it's the weekend and the banks are closed so no way to wire more cash into the exchange.  Also Roger's gang of BCH misfits will at some point run out of BTC to manipulate with, or they'll start to get cold feet when BTC resurges and simply give up on the takeover .

Two senators including mine Jared Polis (D-CO) introduced a bill that would allow you to spend up to $600 on a single transaction without incurring a tax hit. This would in reality allow people to pay for most of their monthly needs (food, gas, clothing, fun...) without tax (aside from regular sales tax). The bill also calls for the Treasury Department to provide guidelines for reporting on profits and losses tied to digital currencies, which would be a huge bonus for bitcoin and its price, creating more comfort with institutional investors, I don’t know where the bill sits right now, but let’s all hope it moves forward soon.

I'd be buying this drop if I had cash on an exchange, as would many.  Tomorrow banks are open and I'll wire in, see where it settles and then BUY.  Many will do the same thing, their just waiting to see where the bottom is. And remember, two can play this short-sell manipulation game.  There are just as many whales who favor BTC and they can buy up BCH, sell it short and create a panic sale.  They can also pick a price to buy more BTC at and start the reversal of this stupidity.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:33:55
Hype and potential.   The new futures exchanges (CME..COME, and now even Nasdaq) all help take bitcoin to the next level of investor access.  There is some risk being discussed that they could be used to harm bitcoin pricing (whales shorting/manipulate) or that it will decrease the wild volatility and reduce the rate of gains but overall having billions of new money and interest is seen as a positive.   Then there's other potential we could see realized in the next year with Lightening Network, Amazon..even additional hard forks that create wealth out of nothing.   You couple all of that and mix in the never ending hype cycle that it feeds and you get this circular pattern of new developments feeding the news hype, which feeds the price...which starts all over again.

Probably a combination of factors but my theory is the single biggest was this stupid fucking BCH fork and specifically the hash war that it created.  How do you fund the hash power (it’s primarily rented..) without losing lots of money ? You setup leveraged shorts, layered in for a few weeks prior to the fork and then you announce (tweet) that you will dump BTC to fund it and drop the price to $1000, which is exactly what Dr Craig Wright did.  Follow up with some well timed BTC dumps, and let bots trigger, panic selling ensues and BAM, you’ve made enough on your 100x leveraged shorts to not just pay for your $500k per day hash fight but likely also made a tidy profit.   These guys are not dumb and they have the money and means to hire smarter people to orchestrate exactly the above..

I use Ledger Nano, love it.  Make sure you store the 24 word key someplace safe...such as a bank safety deposit box. Also, learn how to setup a passphrase (25th word) that you commit to memory (don’t write down) and you’ll have the ultimate in security.

You can't just look and say that 6k BTC sold here and there isn't a large enough percent of the market to not have caused the crashes... I firmly believe it is. Well timed big block dumping across the top 3-4 exchanges can absolutely create massive price drops.  
1. Sell on the back of bad news... adding to the initial FUD and panic sale with big scary 500 BTC sale blocks chewing threw Buy Orders and creating red candle fear. 
2. Trigger the bots... and keep triggering them as the price bottoms and tries to find support.  
Well played you can tank it... and if you setup enough shorts across CME, CBOE and LedgerX (plus margin calls on exchanges that allow it) you will reap TENS of MILLIONS. Even if you don't do it directly, work with 3rd party hedge funds or whale pools who can add their own weight ot the above scheme and BAM.... Profits.

There’s also the perception that 1) one trader with lots of BTC shouldn’t be able to move prices as much as it’s being hypothesized.  Even if he couldn’t there’s still some fear by some that he did. 2) There’s some fear he has a lot more BTC to dump...even though he stated they might now, he didn’t commit to it if needed.

If he wanted to simply fund hash buys/shifts with measured BTC sales then you would want maximum price returns, not announce to the world you were going to crash the price.  He’s using the entire community and every investor to fund his selfish bullshit.  Worse, the SEC will look at this as manipulation and any commissioner on the fence for the ETF vote is now concerned.   It even takes the bullish potential out of BAKT, those potential buyers will not jump hard on an asset that just lost 30% and Warren Buffett calls rat poison.

If he was any type of competent trustee he would have either used an auction or OTC to avoid slippage and market impact.  For me he’s either a total idiot (unlikely) or worked with a third party to short the market prior to his dumps.

Here’s my two cents... you should us a Ledger and add a 25th word which you never write down.  Use the second wallet that generates and keep all your crypto in there.  Next Store your 24 words in a bank safety deposit box, inside a zip lock in case they ever had the sprinklers turn on.  That’s $50 a year, plus $.50 cents for the ziplock.  With a cloud approach your introducing all kinds of unknowns...what if the data was corrupted, what if your account was deleted... That 25th word acts as a password to your seed words....and you should either share that with your significant other or put it and instructions on where the safety deposit box is in your will.  I keep a second fully cloned Ledger in my bank box just in case, not really necessary though.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:49:04
This is what lack of regulation brings...the trustee can share his plans and schedule to sell with his hedge fund buddies who then go short on the futures market, likely spread on a variety of shorting vehicles (exchanges, CBOE, CME..LedgerX...) as to not tip their hand and then BAM instant profits.  Normally that would be illegal but without regulation, anything’s doable.  This to me is the single biggest threat to Bitcoin today, not FUD but fraud.  Too many people sitting on 100k+ coins that have incentive to be bad actor and personally profit.  From the Mt Gox trustee to Roger Ver and Gavin Ayre....and done correctly they never really have to spread their holdings, they can rinse and repeat forever.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:19:46
All in his plan strategy to fund the hash war.....take out highly leveraged shorts on BTC, then this tweet....market manipulation.   Follow that with big dumps on the market to trigger bots and panic.  Viola, you make more money then you lose buying hash power.   Why else tweet that and cause panic when you know admit you’ll  need to sell your BTC to fight your stupid war.   In other markets he’d be in jail for manipulation

I watch 50-100 BTC move GDAX by $100 up or down all the time. If you coordinate that 10x across the top three exchanges it's not insane, it's entirely doable.  Especially if you piggy-back on some bad news and FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:54:50
Keep in mind that the Y-axis is not really the same metric for both coins...Its “Satoshi”but both BTC and BCH share that unit of measurement...you have to multiply that by the currency exchange to USD to really compare them
Don’t get me wrong, I dislike BCash and want that scam team to fail but we need to use the right metrics when evaluating them.

But then why didn't he sell the BTC at auction like other assets often get sold during bankruptcy? If he sold on the spot market only an idiot would think you wouldn't suffer slippage even if shorting with futures wasn't the behind the scene play?

Think about it, 100x leveraged BTC short positions layered in on Bitfinex will cover their cost all the way down.  It will literally generate profits on top of the BTC they sell so that the hash buys or loss from not mining the more profitable BTC is negated.

Here’s my personal rule of thumb...if you hold more then a few months salary in crypto;
1.  Hardware Wallet.  Don’t dick around..store it in a hardware wallet. I love my Ledger
2. Secure Seed Words. Write them down physically and store them someplace safe, such as bank safety deposit box. Never store them on your PC or even digitally (such as on a cloud service).  
3. Use a 25th Word. Ledger calls it a “passphrase” but it’s essentially is a 25 seed word that you never write down and acts as an password on top of our seed words just in case if someone ever gained access to your written (hopefully secured) base seed words (note; learn also how you use your hw wallet to setup and access the wallet associated with this)
4. Have an Inheritance Plan.  I’d suggest you store basic instruction with your written secured seed words in your bank safety deposit box, so your family understand how to access. Remember someone will also need to know your 25th (extra secret) word.  
Everyone does it different but some variation and understanding each of the above will ensure your crypto is highly secured.   I’d love to hear other strategies people use... 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:12:38
Agree... this is a calculated strategy by the BCH camps with high probability they put layered shorts on prior to FakeSatoshi tweeting he would take BTC back to $1000.  They are rich fucks who don’t give a shit about you or me, or even the technology only their personal greed and power.  Not sure how it plays out, short squeeze could reverse things quickly as smart people begin to analyze their strategy and take advantage of it.   Or they could identify it and jump on the same ride.... The problem is the sheep (crowd) just see panic and they accelerate the drop.  Which of course was FakeSatoshi and teams plan so fuck em

I use a Ledger Nano hardware wallet with the 24 word seed stored both in a cheap wall safe at home and in a bank safety deposit box.  I also use a 25th word passphrase which is never written down as added security on top of those 24 words.

Why do that?  Buy Options on LedgerX, and Futures on CME, CBOE... then dump enough to hit those shorts. No one notices... do it again a few weeks later.  He probably wasn't trying to destroy Bitcoin, just profit insanely from it (again, and again...)
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:02:54
I agree the Mt Gox trustee holdings and sales represent a small (tiny) fraction of the available market but that Bitcoin was not just 'deposited on exchanges' the trustee disclosed he sold and when he sold. Analysis has been done that clearly correlates those sales with large dips (huge at points) in the spot market price. And if you dump 2000 BTC across exchanges on the back of FUD news that is already creating a price drop you can in theory accelerate and increase that drop. Every big trader out there understand resistance and support levels, so I watch the initial FUD dip and at each level that it appears to be seeking support, I sell off 1000 BTC across the top 3-4 exchanges.  BAM, we've busted thru that support and I sit back and wait for the next support... repeat. If the week before I've spread short positions on CME, CBOE, LedgerX and margined calls on exchanges I will be using the news FUD and my carefully timed block sales to reap tens of millions in a single day.  
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:50:28
I’ve thought about ideas like this as well, but honestly I don’t trust cloud providers.  What if they corrupted the files? Instead I use the bank safety deposit but I also use a 25th word (passphrase) on my Ledger that is never written down.  The odds of someone accessing my words is already crazy low (locked in two different safe locations) but they’d then also need my 25th word.  
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:22:13
I had the exact same thing happen and here’s the thing...sometimes when you send bitcoin there’s a “balance” transaction that stays on your ledger but goes to a new address.   The “balance”concept as explained to me is exactly that, you use a $20 bill to buy a $2 coffee and you get $18 in change (the balance) and that needs to go to a new address that’s still on your Ledger. The only thing I’ve never figured out was why not every send includes a balance address.

My theory, (completely out of my ass, but based on a range of observations ). 
We have three groups of sellers. 
1. Whales who hold 10-100k BTC and are peeling off a percent of that into fiat. It makes sense to take some profits off the table.  
2. Traders who hold enough to manipulate swings of $500-$1000. I know people think you cannot do this, but if you time block sales of 1000 BTC properly at resistance points you can create panic and bot selling and profit off short positions.  
3. Average Joe’s who have been told they should sell and then buy back after the big corrections....
Of the above three groups, only the first will not move their fiat back in as they’re smartly diversifying their portfolio. 
I also believe over the next six months it will remain choppy until that first group slows down, and the second group then gets caught in a short squeeze...  
Finally, alts days are numbered...major exchanges will begin delisting the worst of the shit and others will follow, creating panic selling into BTC and what I consider to be the core alts ( eth , ltc,rxp...).   Even those might decouple from BTC as new money will largely be institutional and only interested in BTC due to the ability to hedge with futures and options.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:50:41

Not if they planned to do exactly that and setup leveraged shorts prior to FakeSatoshi tweeting he would dump BTC to $1000 when switching hash power....  then they made millions, and will continue to. In a normal market his tweet would be considered blatant manipulation and illegal, look at Elon Musk suggesting he might take Tesla private.   This was very likely all planned carefully prior and is not really “costing” them anything.

Bad analogy but It used to be difficult to find and download mp3 files but we saw quick development of Napster...then Spotify....I predict a new breed of startup digital bank will show up that allows holding crypto right next to your cash, with the ability to move between (trade) as well as leverage your crypto for other financial needs (loans, online payments...).  We will see the big guys like Coinbase but possibly also Amazon compete to replace and disrupt banks as we know them. The market opportunity is simply to big to not solve for it.

I’ve seen analysis on the dates of the sales that shows fairly strong correlation between those large sales and the large price drops we’ve seen the past few months.  Even if not intentional they may have simply triggered stop losses and bot selling, creating the dips.

It matters because the BCash group aggressively try to attack and confuse... Go read the /BTC sub... go to bitcoin.com.... it's pathetic.

Keep in mind FakeSatoshi isn’t dumb, perhaps a ego maniac, socialpath but not dumb.  Also, he isn’t alone, he has the best team money can buy who likely analyzed all possible scenarios and carefully planned for this.

I like your thinking,,,, interesting to do some research on this, 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:12:16
I assumed they could take a joke...their BCash is.

Most Technical Analysis shows a correction down to $7700 which we’ve briefly touched (or come close) twice.  That’s fine, it is testing that support level and might continue to do it for the next few days. Investors are watching to see if that support holds and if it does, then we are poised for a nice recovery back up to the teens.....
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:51:20
I'll be honest, I read back over my rbtc posts and I see I was a bit of a troll...  Not my intention or usual style but I did let my frustration with their market approach get the best of me.  
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:28:36
Seriously?...zero integrity for pointing out we need to use the same metrics?  I hold exactly 0 BCH and hope it dies quickly btw.
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:44:36
I don't understand it myself... I've seen smaller discrepancies, for example $50-$100 that begin to shrink over time but all day GDAX has been up anywhere from $250-$300 over BITFINEX and others. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:21:04
I don't quite understand why some are being so aggressive to the OP, his post is interesting and of some value. He has to convert the Satoshi to the same unit of measure but other then that it does show the cost of transactions for BTC are getting much closer to BCH.

She did pretty good...and considering the exposure she just brought us I’d give her props..
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:26:38
Seems to me the spot market would be the worse place to sell if that's the case... an auction would be better or OTC. But I'm not close to an expert on that :)

I keep my Ledger Nano in a basic wall safe ($90 on Amazon) but the 24 word seed in a bank safety deposit box.  
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:01:08
Unfortunately... there's no way in hell I could remember it even if I worked hard (partly due to my dyslexia). Instead I pay $50 a year for a bank safety deposit box where I keep a backup copy of my current Ledger and my 24 word seed. What I do not store there is my 25th word (passphrase).  I memorized that.. :)... So even if someone ever gained access to the safety box there's yet another layer of protection.  
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:44:26
Read it and now my head hurts...
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:02:12
Agree...they will slowly dilute but it can do a lot of damage during the next year when we need momentum, not more negatives and hurdles.  
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:39:47
No idea if this is a technically sound possibility but if Coinbase is implementing SegWit wouldn’t they need to send from a legacy wallet to a SegWit wallet and could that cause the mempool to jump while they do it? We’re talking about a LOT of BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:23:18
I’m happy....sold on the way down at $9k... then rebought today at $8k.... Helps build the stack.  
Will it dip lower, maybe but most of the people who are good at TA show $7700 and we seem to be bouncing off that support level quite nicely.  
So my advice, be a Hodlr but if you get the chance carefully trade the dips and spin them into stack.gains
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:41:43
Also, using 30k to strategically push past support levels when the market is panic selling can easily drop things further.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:04:05
It's can be near anonymous until you exit to fiat (or enter from fiat)... And for now that's a necessity.  Someday when you can spend crypto more easily on everyday life that's when it will get more interesting.

I've been keeping an eye on the difference all day between GDAX and BITFINEX on all three coins they share (BTC, ETH, LTC) waiting for one of them to close the gap and offer a nice arbitrage option but all three have maintained a 6-8% higher price on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:52:48
Normally there's not $200-$300 of difference (more like $20-$50)...today's GDAX prices have been unusually high.  But, if you knew this would be the case and had USD sitting on BITFINEX, bought BTC for $4000 then sent it to GDAX and sold for $4300 that, you'd make a nice $300 per BTC.

Perhaps that’s another great example of insider trading..a bit like how much BCash was traded hours before B
Coinbase announced they were adding it, 
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:49:00
I use a Ledger Nano S (better protection then Trezor) with the 24 word seed stored in a bank safety deposit box.  I also utilize a 25th word passphrase that I memorized (never written) so even if someone was to compromise my 24 words they’d need that to access my funds. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:01:42
And ever time they get a little more guidance to what it will take for approval... so every application is valuable and part of the required path.
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:56:56
It's important because even if the request is rejected they will provide more clarity as to what they require to finally approve, just as they did with the last batch of ETF applications back at the end of 2017.  This gets us one step closer (and probably a big step).  
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:56:10
How do you see/verify this?
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:45:28
I use a Ledger with a passphrase...and keep a cloned Ledger with my printed 24 word seed in a bank safety deposit box.  The passphrase (25th word) is not written anywhere so even if someone accessed the safety deposit there’s little (to no) risk they could access the funds.  
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:29:49
Apparently blood brothers....those losses look painful.
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:07:26
It’s very possible that large groups of holders are trying to reduce their 2018 tax liabilities by wash trading ....unlike traditional equities like stocks, technically they don’t need to sell/buy the same exact Bitcoin (and technically the way it works you can’t...) and also unlike stocks wash trading crypto isn’t illegal (yet).   So even though these specific wallets might not have activity in 2018, they could still be being used for wash trade purposes.
