That’s the thing. Do you really want the prices of everyday products fluctuating every day? Bitcoin will never be an actual widely accepted currency, as it lacks stability at all and is limited in “production”.
@_date: 2018-05-08 23:59:08
Nice decision, really helped me understand the true issue.
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:40:41
Fair enough, but I think you’re missing the point really. Although all currencies rise and fall (etc), bitcoin is far more volatile, making it hard to use as a currency. I’m fine with the idea of crypto and all, but bitcoin was like a bad first attempt for me, you know? Something to get attention, but not actually useful for everyday life. I’d far more support other cryptos, although they’re having a rough time catching on. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 11:53:04
1) except that the USD used to be gold backed, and is pretty highly regulated. There is nothing controlling or stabilizing bitcoin’s price at all
2) except that bitcoin allows for mostly traceless transactions, meaning paying someone to do just about anything is fairly easier/safer
3) I mean in the reality of it all, it’s a limited production currency, as in there can only be so many. In the short run prices will rise, but eventually it will either become some kind of niche currency or collectible, losing all value or being pretty much priceless.
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:31:12
This wasn’t presented before, but is fairly eye opening. I guess it’s pretty much everything I said and more :P thanks for helping!
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:00:25
So it’s more beef with them stealing the work and all behind it and putting their name on it, rather than just trying to take credit? Or a mix of both?
@_date: 2019-03-28 07:49:53
Yes, because that's exactly what I was implying right? Or just that it's the easiest comparison to make as most people understand how stocks work compared to other forms of investment. Gold is a physical item that has maintained usage, and still isn't widely accepted. Remind me of the last time a bond or real estate dropped 90% of it's value from market fluctuation? 
You've changed nothing whatsoever. Stock is the closest comparison to Bitcoin, as it's just another investment with random fluctuations. I've stated why your comparisons are flawed. Prove me wrong.
@_date: 2019-03-27 00:29:46
But again, cash and Bitcoin serve the same purpose. You can easily use either without a "bank". It's a method of payment, a currency.
@_date: 2019-03-27 00:13:40
Except Bitcoin includes block chain and all that bullshit. It's all in one. Are you gonna call a dollar a unit of accounting as well?
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:43:44
Nope, my own pure thoughts on it. I invested a solid $50 when the price was under a hundred, and sold right before $1k quite a few years back. It's an investment that was meant to be a currency. Please point out how I'm wrong instead of attempting some ad hominem. 
Except it literally acts like a stock. Next you're gonna tell me 2017 wasn't a bubble right? You literally admit its an investment my dude. You don't invest in cash/currency. Bitcoin is a horrid first implementation of crypto. Others will prevail over it with different changes that fix bitcoin's flaws.
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:24:41
Lol then please enlighten me. What don't I understand here? Additionally USD won't be abandoned, because it's the only stable currency you can viably use in day to day life. Bitcoin? Its playing the stock market almost. One Bitcoin may equal one Bitcoin, but it's true value will always fluctuate. Im sure 1 Bolivar still equals 1 Bolivar, right? /s
Yet again, Bitcoin is very limited. It's backed by nothing, has a set limit on supply, and makes all transactions public. Oh, and it's virtual. Other currencies aren't going anywhere, and BTC will be what it is today.
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:20:46
I'm quite aware. Currencies change in price. Bitcoin is only resistant in the aspect it can't be mass produced.  That doesn't make it immune or any less prone to inflation than other currencies.
Again, I'm aware. No need to explain highschool economics to me. A crash would heavily effect the USD, as does any economic event. Bitcoin is affected by these as well, along with its own heavy fluctuations.
Yet here it is... Still making people nearly bankrupt. It solves nothing besides setting a limit to production. I'm well aware of the fad phase it went through, but I doubt it'll happen again unless there's another bubble. 
Do I need to explain stocks to you? I think you know how stocks work. Bitcoin acts like a stock, because you always have to trade back to USD or whatever currency you use. Very few times is it viable or worth it to use Bitcoin directly. If it isn't stable, it isn't some kind of USD/Cash replacement.
Nope, the (very far) future will just further the extremes by preventing any more coins from being mined. I'm sure the market will fully survive that right? I'm sure crypto in general will pickup, but Bitcoin? No.
@_date: 2019-03-27 01:35:07
I'm well aware. I won't be using that money. As I've explained it's in no way a better cash, as it doesn't serve the same purpose as cash. I have been following Bitcoin since around 2010. Nothing has changed whatsoever. It became a fad that died as quick as it rose to popularity. If it gains traction? Good for you guys. I and many others still won't be using it. There is no benefit versus cash for me.
Given Bitcoin has a set limit for how many coins can be made, yeah it's probably not gonna end well. It will either fall completely flat or become some collectible that will be scarcely used. I like the idea of crypto, just not Bitcoin. All it's done is pave the way for others.
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:03:53
Bitcoin acts exactly as a stock, with a wildly fluctuating price and basically being an investment in a "business" instead of any kind of currency.
This isn't the 18/19th century any more. I could say the same about plenty of other issues, the average life expectancy over all of history, a car's life expectancy, but we all know currency isn't going to just die out of nowhere. Maybe you're not familiar with the banking system and literally everything else designed to keep a currency stable?
I'm not going to use a currency if it might be completely worthless in a few days. Calling this thoughtless is idiotic, you know damn well Bitcoin isn't stable and the issues around stability. What's keeping it stable, huh? Anything whatsoever? It's users have all the power, meaning it could go to zero at any time if said users panicked or whatever. 
A set cap prevents more currency from being produced, meaning the market for it will go through rapid deflation, valuing Bitcoin more and more. Keep in mind I'm talking about when the last coin is actually mined and all. Talk to Japan about the issues of deflation and why it isn't so great to have an ever increasing in value currency.
And you don't seem to understand economics. A currency with no stability is barely a currency whatsoever. Your notion of it gaining value proves just that. I'm well aware of how it all works, but Id rather not have every transaction I make Public. I'd rather not be gambling when cashing a check. You get the idea. Some issues can be solved by variation, some can't. Tying it to a fiat currency is great for many people, giving stability. Other times you'd want to make a gamble. That's the flexibility of crypto, and why I'm not ungodly opposed to it. I just wouldn't use it, and don't see the viability of Bitcoin itself.
Who said I didn't invest? Again you've proven my point of Bitcoin acting like a stock and having no stability. How come you speak of popularity of it isn't some fad? If it's popular, it goes up in value right? How come it's been falling off quite a bit? Bitcoin may not be going anywhere, but I'll laugh when someone genuinely uses it as payment in day to day life. Oh that 15btc car you could afford and saved up for? Now it's around 16-18. Why? Because market fluctuation. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:27:45
Bitcoin is literally a crypto**currency**. Try again.
Just as banks are built on top of regular currencies. All the difference is security and shit. To the daily user it means nothing.
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:01:58
It does however wildly fluctuate in price and act like a stock in many ways. It may not be a stock, but if it walks, talks, and looks like one...
@_date: 2019-03-28 02:20:48
You keep on saying it's not a stock, yet you keep speaking about it being an investment instead of a currency. Are you sure you have your logic worked out there? It may help those with failing governments/economies, but it easily bankrupts those who blindly invest and lose a fuck ton. Why should people be burned for using a currency? Or maybe, just maybe, it's more like a stock, having bull rush scenarios that reward the smart and punish the dumb. It's progressing exactly like a stock. Wider adoption prompts higher prices, and failures result in drops. This thread is about the viability of Bitcoin as a currency. You know that right? Yet again, you don't invest in a currency, that's just not how that works. 
To the moon right? Blind following is such a wonder.
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:22:27
Wouldn't that be a wonderful world? Too bad people don't always have the best intentions at heart, and market fluctuations exist. We are speaking on currency and currency alone. Our currency is almost completely stable. That's almost all you need in a currency.
Finite money means that money will become scarce eventually, and rapid deflation will follow. This isn't hard to understand. People will abuse this system very easily by flooding the deflated market with their savings and such. Neither is better by any standards. Both are terrible in their own right. The fact of the matter though? A capped limit will cause heavy deflation versus the inflation the US is currently experiencing.
I didn't mean it literally, just that price can literally jump or crash at any time from any seller/buyer. You don't experience this with the USD. Value for Bitcoin is always changing. The USD? You can go to the same store for a bottle of soda for the same price for years, can't say the same with Bitcoin.
Yep, which is why I keep my cash in most occasions. I only use other methods when needed or to build credit. Just an FYI as well, you're speaking of a future system. The USD is a physical currency that can be represented digitally. Physical transactions will never die.
10 years doesn't speak much compared to the USD. Additionally you've just proven further that Bitcoin is heavily deflated as a currency, always increasing in value. We don't want inflation OR deflation, we want stability in our currency. It's popularity is naturally rising, but that doesn't account for mainstream adoption, which is what I was really talking about. How many times have you used BTC to buy something casually? Compare that to the times you use USD (Or whatever currency you use). This is what matters. If I can't use a currency anywhere, I'm not gonna use it flat out unless I'm forced to. 
To clarify, I'm not opposed to crypto itself. Bitcoin paved the way for everyone else. Sadly it does have some flaws, that I'm sure someone will smooth out with another crypto one day. No crypto is perfect, just as no physical dollar is perfect. It's just a matter of time before one becomes more or equally viable as the USD.
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:29:04
Jesus Christ are you people literally insane? I never said Bitcoin is bad. I just won't use I personally and don't think it'll revolutionize anything. It's done what it can,and it'll eventually "die off".
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:09:58
Yet here it is, being a stock with wildly varying value each day. I see you're a purist. Tell me again why they're scams? Because they aren't the original crypto or aren't as popular?
Why? Because it can scam it's users easily by creating excess and manipulating the price, cashing out and leaving everyone else in rubble? Remind me of the last time the US Government scammed users of the USD. Okay, now remind me of how many people entered the market at 20k only to lose roughly 50% of their investment. Which one is a scam again? The regulated and stable one, or the other that bankrupts many of it's users?
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:33:33
It's literally a fuckin stock, how blind are you? Random startup goes for pennies and eventually makes it up to the big leagues from innovation and popularity. It's a damn popularity contest. **A fad.**
Which again, doesn't make it some miracle replacement for the USD and a fair/viable currency. It IS a currency, just not a very good one.
Because everything about Bitcoin is good, besides a few key things that make it a no-go for me. No stability, set cap for supply, and all transactions public. It's trading a stock for everyday goods. If the same tech was used in a different way that fixed these issues, IE any other crypto, I might be a bit more open to it.
@_date: 2019-03-27 07:36:54
No, crypto as a whole is. Bitcoin will some day die (as a currency), and another currency will take its place with roughly the same feature set. Why do y'all always act like Bitcoin is the be all end all of crypto? It's extremely flawed and doesn't have much left to give. Additionally, no regulation equals no true security in funds. It might be ANOTHER financial system some people may choose to gamble on, but unless it's backed in some way or controls its value somehow, it'll never replace what we currently have.
@_date: 2019-03-26 22:53:08
No no, its literally a currency. Its sole purpose is to be a method of payment.
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:58:08
And remind me the last time you used good to buy a general good? Pretty sure 17k to a bit above 1k is pretty damn close to 90%, although it might have been a bit of an exaggeration. Either way it proves the terrible instability of Bitcoin.
You don't understand what truly values a currency, but hey it's not my issue either. Go ahead with your blind investment, it's not a bubble right?
@_date: 2019-03-27 01:13:16
Except they're both currencies. I couldn't care less about the supply if it can't let me pay my bills and shit.
But it's demand and everything surrounding the supply can be. Bitcoin is a terrible cash. It's barely adopted, fluctuates rapidly in value, and offers little to nothing to the average consumer compared to cash. Bitcoin is a non existent item which people use to trade, versus a physical item accepted everywhere that's proven to be stable within a few percentage. Remind me again how "stable" Bitcoin is?
@_date: 2019-03-28 02:13:42
Backing and regulation is what gives currency value. A currency without backing(or just indeterminate value)  is next to worthless, hence why Bitcoin has had a hard time being adopted. Who says it would be that stable? Anyone could easily flood the market with savings or wealth, as there's no regulation over it whatsoever. Slow deflation is again no better than inflation. Go talk to some people in Japan, it's no better. Literally Google the issues with deflation, it's not that hard to understand. Bitcoin has multiple flaws, which is why another crypto may be better for general adoption. Comparing Bitcoin to gold is just wrong. Bitcoin is a digital currency no value besides trading. Gold is a rare resource that has many practical use cases. It's also a physical item. It's also a very niche item of trade, so I guess it can relate in that way at least.
As would Bitcoin through periods of recession and growth. As I said, I'm not against crypto or any type of unifying currency. I just don't think this is the right way to go about it, especially for "replacing" the USD.
@_date: 2019-03-27 01:15:55
I'm not trying to have a damn debate over which I use, Jesus Christ. Bitcoin is a flawed ass currency that has barely any adoption compared to USD. Bitcoin has no stability. The only power it has is being digital. Having everything as public record isn't always the best thing. Sometimes physical items are better than digital. Do I really need to explain to you why Bitcoin hasn't had much adoption?
@_date: 2019-03-27 01:30:02
And that is it's main downfall. It is not "inflation resistant" despite whatever you may believe. It doesn't take a government to fuck up the price. Have you seen the last year or so in BTC pricing?
Exactly, which also has more benefits than a virtual currency in many cases. Bitcoin is nice and all, but at the end of the day it's a child of r/WallStreetBets that will never see the light of day. Bitcoin may not be able to be manipulated by a governing body, but it sure as hell can be manipulated by it's users, which IMO is much more dangerous. Also what makes you think Bitcoin won't devalue as fast as USD? A market crash would be issue to it as well.
@_date: 2019-03-27 18:33:53
Ad hominem from yet another blind supporter. Tell me how. Provide backing.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:01:45
They just now figured this out?
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:59:52
Fair enough hahah, I put myself up to that one.
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:36:24
It does? By that logic sexual acts and plenty of other stuff is currency because it can be traded for drugs. A currency is a medium of exchange, a way to universally trade anything. Bitcoin is barely taking baby steps as one.
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:58:35
Fair enough, didn’t know if there was more at play or not. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:22:36
Lol that just adds to the irony. The exact stigma most crypto people want to avoid is the reason you give for it being a “currency”.
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:24:36
If bitcoin hits 2k, it will eventually hit 1k and lower. People that buy will be buying from those who lost enough already, and will eventually either wait an eternity for a return or sell back as well.
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:59:32
Except bitcoin in particular (along with closely related crypto’s) have no real place in the market. I have no doubts it will be implemented correctly in the future without risk and all, but at the current moment crypto is like the smartphone market right now. The more and more saturated the market becomes, the less there is a need at all. Adoption has stopped almost completely, and it’s not looking good whatsoever. Any more success is from people buying back in en mass, not from its actual success.
@_date: 2018-12-16 06:56:14
Cryptos backed by anything will be adopted. Besides that, they’re all pretty much stocks. Nobody wants to be paid in stocks or trade stocks for that matter.
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:44:30
ELI5 why it’s bad? Is it just people trying to steal and shit, or is it something else I’m not really aware of?
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:54:55
Yet again, you cannot directly trade work for a car. You trade work for an actual currency, correct? You’re describing goods and services as currency, which simply isn’t true. We have a definition of the word for a reason. You work for currency, you buy stuff with currency. With somthing that is almost universally accepted and has no real other use than trade.
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:49:13
Lol that’s about 30k down the drain. Shoulda waited till rock bottom when everyone’s desperately selling  to make the slightest bit back. 
You can be a fan of the tech without making bad investments lol, I’m a big fan of Apple but there’s no way I’d buy any time soon.
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:28:46
Stop being deliberately difficult... you know damn well what a currency is, and the difference of that versus a good or service. I know what gives money value. Do you know what gives bitcoin its value? It’s USD or other currency exchange rate. In other words, it’s a virtual commodity for exchange. It CAN be considered a currency, but can’t for many more reasons. You can consider potatoes currency, but nobody will accept potatoes for a car or anything of the sort.
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:00:40
Sadly to most, but many want to believe it’s a true currency. The sad truth is that it’s as tradable as gold. Can’t use gold anywhere can ya?
@_date: 2018-12-16 06:23:29
BTC is easily a stock, have you not seen the comparisons to literal stock trends? There is nothing controlling its value, and you are investing in its future by buying it.
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:56:35
Not necessarily true when the tech will only become more and more niche. Not all stocks bounce back up.
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:57:46
I’m laughing way too hard at the bitterness. He was referring to paper currency, but in defense of the other interpretation, bitcoin probably won’t stabilize ever, being a pump and dump opportunity for most. The stigma of using it for illegal activities will only get worse, as early adopters of real payment using it will probably drop out due to losing any real profit. It’s not looking too good for most crypto’s. The tech is great, but the implementation is rather bad.
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:48:05
Think he meant potential loss, which is still there lol
