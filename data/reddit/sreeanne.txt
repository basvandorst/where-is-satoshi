good post man, i believe in the values(not $) of BTC why it came to existence in the first place. I honestly love it and keeping it for long term.

There are few online software wallets which manage multiple currencies. Ex : jaxx 
In next few years , I see better wallets to access most of Blockchains 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:31:30
hahahahaha! good one man
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:08:11
May be not now,the goal about any tech is to make our lives easier not harder. The more it’s easier to use , the more adoption to crypto will happen.inter ledger protocol is already here. It may not happen in exact form I mentioned, but a lot better form than today.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:45:10
may be that finance minister wanted to buy more on dip.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:54:06

Good insider info :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:17:45
true that.
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:59:34
agree - with 10 coins , struggle to manage with these wallet software. hope one day hybrid blockchains comes to play and let us store ANY coin in them and let us access with one software.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:45:14
whole world is watching for you bro!!
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:34:18
It’s been a really long time I have seen “all in” post with good very good conviction. I don’t think you are gambling as some said in this thread. We are not going to loose anything with BTC. Worst case, BTC returns are always on par with any of 401K plan per year or per 5 yrs. which are between 6% to 12%. Good luck my friend.
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:39:49

website looks pro man.. its great contribution to community.
@_date: 2019-02-02 22:55:03
fundamental rule in cryptos - not your keys, not your coins. Move them off of exchanges. I still dont know who are storing crypto on exchanges after we learn what happened to Mt Gox. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 22:55:47
i am with you brah
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:36:08
thanks Brother!
@_date: 2019-02-23 05:02:21

@_date: 2019-02-23 19:06:25
Right , pretend he and his tweets doesn’t exist.
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:08:18
Go for it and get hardware wallet like ledger nano s to protect your keys. Wish more companies encourage and give options to employees.
@_date: 2019-02-20 03:55:21
Good luck, you are millionaire!, just make sure to move BTC off of exchanges to h/w wallet 
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:07:01
Awwwweee cute, been a while 
@_date: 2019-02-23 04:59:53
“If bitcoin supply ever increased” - this is the stupid thought closely related to bitcoin cash block size increase 
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:11:09
We Never know brother, BTC can do any thing.
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:47:45
without a second thought - i wouldn't trust this.
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:23:46
this math is beyond **/s** brah
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:15:58
except numbers, + and - , i dont understand anything. nothing on x and y axis.
@_date: 2019-02-08 15:49:15
Go girl!
@_date: 2019-02-24 13:37:30
Thanks for letting us know!
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:40:41
thats it!
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:34:38
I was naysayer and 2017 proved me dead wrong and I stopped predicting prices .. and it is impossible to say what BTC does next. It may be or it may not ,, so in between let’s have a good ride
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:22:21
Reminds good old days of 2017
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:52:10
Bitcoin is really bothering Buffet. Why wont he talk about dozens of other non-performing companies n advise us "Hey, dont buy that company"? He knows Bitcoin is real!!
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:31:37
you are millionaire now!
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:45:43

@_date: 2018-03-12 02:42:12
reminds me of my first few months, wild ride, loved and enjoyed it every min.. its just that i closed my eyes after!
@_date: 2019-01-29 10:21:46
These stories makes us stronger and wanted to hold more 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:39:20
That’s the power of btc!!

It’s not bitcoin if it doesn’t dip and it’s not bitcoin if it doesn’t goes up.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:23:52

@_date: 2019-01-20 13:51:26
He says that every time and nothing new
@_date: 2019-01-20 13:44:28
Very satisfying!
@_date: 2019-01-30 11:27:42
Reminds me of my earlier days, I struggled to jump out of my comfort zone to unknown world of crypto until my friend showed me how to buy and he instantly sent BTC to me as he owed me some money. It’s eye opening as we bank at different banks and exchanged cheques before.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:46:18
Good read!
@_date: 2019-01-24 22:46:25

Well Senator, you are our favorite. Thank you for passing our concerns to other members.
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:36:34

@_date: 2019-01-24 16:04:52
i am 5Ker and waiting it to go down, so that i can accumulate more.
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:16:19
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:44:34
hey, you are damn good mind reader.. at least mine.. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 22:45:57
why there are 10 decimals, it should be 8 decimals (0.00000031)
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:09:10
i object, lets predict 12K+
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:50:01
Good decision!
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:34:03
math is simple : x% drop, 50x% growth

@_date: 2018-02-01 17:51:17
i really wish i have some spare money left to buy BTC now... alas..
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:26:49
Killing bitcoin? Very Funny , let’s kill internet first ..
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:52:53

@_date: 2018-02-15 23:52:26
Love it , love it . Love it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:21:59
make sure you have list of all transactions and input them to CoinTracking and they calculate based on FIFO etc. I am using it and it’s good so far. 
Crypto taxes are like kind exchanges After December 31, 2017. So before this date , they are treated like normal stocks and normal tax rates applies.
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:38:59
Block chain and AI - deadly cocktail mix - must be tasty. Both worlds will converge at some point in future when they get matured individually.
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:43:50
Don’t sell land to buy BItcoin. Buy bitcoin if you have spare cash and you will thank yourself later.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:05:22
Don’t focus much on dips, when you ready buy it and hodl for few years. You will thank yourself later
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:16:10
yeah. when exchanges get hack , hackers goes in back-end and steal private keys and transfer funds. 2FA doesnt help here.
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:45:09
i really dont care if its true or not, we need people like  **John McAfee** , who got balls.
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:16:26
hey curious to know when was that?
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:25:54

@_date: 2019-05-03 11:30:51
hey congrats buddy! get them out of exchanges soon.
