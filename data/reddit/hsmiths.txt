If you are using bitcoin-qt, then you likely have 0.01 in a hidden "change" address that got created the first time you spent coins.  Click Help, Debug Window, Console and type the command "listunspent" (without quotes).  It will show you the change address so you can verify on block chain explorer.

You could try launching bitcoin-qt with -zapwallettxes on the command line -- it will drop any unconfirmed transactions and then rescan the blockchain.  It takes a while, but it much much faster than downloading the whole blockchain.  See

It you click on each "spent" you will see that one is "confirmed" and the rest are "unconfirmed".  The coins were spent exactly ONCE and the other attempts failed.  Bitcoin is working exactly as designed.  Even with &gt; 51% it is impossible to confirm sending the same input more than once without forking the blockchain. Eventually the longest chain "wins" and the other chain becomes orphan.

BU gives miners the ability to reduce block size to artificially increase fees. All the talk about "unlimited" is a smoke screen to distract us from the real miner friendly changes in BU: Block size should not be controlled by miners. The incentives are wrong.

I have set maxmempool=10 and had no difficulty. At this setting the mempool contains everything that is likely to confirm in the next few hours. In fact, I sometimes point users with stuck transactions to connect to this node so that their low-fee transaction will be removed from their history, allowing them to try again with a proper fee.

Interesting that buy.bitcoin.com does not mention BCH. Why would Ver do that? An oversight or is his support of BCH half-hearted?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:02:54
Bitcoin Cash has a "EDA" or "Emergency Difficulty Adjustment" which is being gamed by the miners to cause huge swings in difficulty. This causes BCH to be more profitable than BTC from time to time. The "fix" for this is to smooth out the difficulty so that it will not be as easy for miners to take advantage. Without EDA it has always been more profitable to mine BTC.

From the bitcoinabc.org announcement:

@_date: 2017-04-09 02:08:34
So if I understand correctly, it boils down to updating the miner or pooler software being used. If using something like cgminer, bfgminer, eloipool or ckpool then updating to the latest version will signal segwit. 
This puts the miners who rolled their own software at a disadvantage, which might explain their reluctance to move away from their tried and true (and possibly not very well understood) custom mining software.
@_date: 2017-04-09 02:50:21
Did you quickly send the amount after seeing it arrive in your wallet? Or was the balance there for days before you sent it out?  
I suspect the original incoming transaction was unconfirmed and eventually was returned to the original sender you received from. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 03:40:17
@_date: 2017-04-09 02:55:57
The fees are based on the "size" of your transaction. The "size" depends on the number of inputs and outputs. 
If you have many small inputs in your wallet, it will be expensive to spend them because the resulting transaction "size" will be large. This is typical of "faucets" where the amounts are so small it costs more to spend them than they are worth.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:01:41
BU nodes do not understand RBF (Replace-By-Fee). If you mark all your transactions as Replaceable they will be accepted only by Core nodes.

Some of the key findings include the following:
* The current number of unique active users of cryptocurrency wallets is estimated to be between 2.9 million and 5.8 million. 
* The lines between the different cryptocurrency industry sectors are increasingly blurred: 31 per cent of cryptocurrency companies surveyed are operating across two cryptocurrency industry sectors or more, giving rise to an increasing number of universal cryptocurrency companies.
* At least 1,876 people are working full- time in the cryptocurrency industry, and the actual total figure is likely well above two thousand when large mining organisations and other organisations that did not provide headcount figures are added.
* Average security headcount and costs for payment companies and exchanges as a percentage of total headcount/operating expenses are similar, but significantly higher for wallets.

Too many changes all at once. Made consensus harder to reach. It would have been better to introduce these improvements in stages. Problem is the community is impatient and they didn't want to make us wait so long to get everything in place.

When you recovered the from the seed, did you put in a new password?  The new wallet won't recognize the old password unless you explicitly set that same password on the new wallet during the recover process. 
The password is reset when you use a seed, so you could try again, leaving password blank.

Notable changes
RPC changes
- -----------
- The first positional argument of `createrawtransaction` was renamed from `transactions` to `inputs`.
- The argument of `disconnectnode` was renamed from `node` to `address`.
These interface changes break compatibility with 0.14.0, when the named arguments functionality, introduced in 0.14.0, is used. Client software using these calls with named arguments needs to be updated.
- ------
In previous versions, getblocktemplate required segwit support from downstream clients/miners once the feature activated on the network. In this version, it now supports non-segwit clients even after activation, by removing all segwit transactions from the returned block template. This allows non-segwit miners to continue functioning correctly even after segwit has activated.
Due to the limitations in previous versions, getblocktemplate also recommended non-segwit clients to not signal for the segwit version-bit. Since this is no longer an issue, getblocktemplate now always recommends signalling segwit for all miners. This is safe because ability to enforce the rule is the only required criteria for safe activation, not actually producing segwit-enabled blocks.
UTXO memory accounting
- ----------------------
Memory usage for the UTXO cache is being calculated more accurately, so that the configured limit (`-dbcache`) will be respected when memory usage peaks during cache flushes.  The memory accounting in prior releases is estimated to only account for half the actual peak utilization.
The default `-dbcache` has also been changed in this release to 450MiB.  Users who currently set `-dbcache` to a high value (e.g. to keep the UTXO more fully cached in memory) should consider increasing this setting in order to achieve the same cache performance as prior releases.  Users on low-memory systems (such as systems with 1GB or less) should consider specifying a lower value for this parameter.

It fixes a bug introduced in 0.14.0.  See 
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:30:01
It fixes the substantial transaction malleability problem once and for all, enabling second-layer scaling solutions like Lightning.
It 1.7x’s the # of single-signature transactions per block and 4x’s the # of multi-signature transactions per block.
It improves the efficiency of signature-hashing so it scales linearly rather than quadratically.
It makes it safer for hardware wallets to sign transactions by explicitly hashing and signing input values.
It upgrades pay-to-script-hash transactions from 160-bit hashes to 256-bit hashes.
It introduces versioning for the scripting language to allow for more easy upgradeability.
It reduces the growth of the system’s most burdensome resource: unspent transaction outputs, which are ideally kept in memory.
It allows for bandwidth and disk space reductions for lightweight nodes by allowing them to ignore historical signatures.

The Federal Reserve is piling up unrealized losses on its $4.1 trillion bond portfolio, raising questions about its finances at a politically dicey moment for the independent central bank.
The Fed had losses of $66.5 billion on its securities holdings on Sept. 30, if it marked them to market, according to its latest quarterly financial report. That dwarfed its $39.1 billion in capital, effectively leaving it with a negative net worth on that basis, a sure sign of financial frailty if it were an ordinary company.
