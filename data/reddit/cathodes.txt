No I mean some people are charitable while others are money hungry and dangerously nieve.

Optimistic but very possible.

Guys im not saying we cant be successful. Im just saying there is no value in this if we don't believe there is one. I believe the word is "agreed value". Bitcoin is going to be the next Enron if we just play a game of greed. Lets be successful in doing something fulfilling so this technology sticks around for another year?

Peace of mind vs actuality. Isnt this the same argument religion tries to make?

No but many a man has ruined himself chasing that same dream. Just be objective and keep level headed.

Im going to give it a try I will post back.

Exactly. Even physical currency and commodities like gold work on the same principle. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 00:38:23
Spreading this technology and its potential value. Good news all around.

Extrapolation is dangerous. Objectivity is optimistic with any new technology.

This is awesome. Hopefully other services will follow in lowering their fees.

Bitcoin has hit a few rough patches recently but the fact that it prevailed through those challenges has started to change public opinion on this technology. We are seeing progress.

Hey bitcoin community that dosent like this because of the drug reference. Maybe one of the problems with bitcoins is that we aren't willing to admit to the same legality issues that are reasons for governments to shut down this technology despite legitimacy surfacing. Maybe a chance in perspective is in order?

Has he retired yet? The donations about to roll in are going to be something serious.

And its your cake day? Jesus Christ this is reddit gold.

Is there no merit in humor? Maybe half the battle with Bitcoin is marketing towards the percentage of the population that dosent have a stick stuck up their ass and can be real.
