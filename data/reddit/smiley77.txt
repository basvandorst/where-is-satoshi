Bitcoin with games sounds great in theory, the problem is gaming companies have the worst security.  Last I heard gold miners in MMO's don't mine gold anymore, they steal accounts because it's easier and quicker.
That being said, maybe they can go with a third party solution like bitgo or something like that.

Make it a free/semi-free music concert, with QR codes everywhere to take donations.  Sell t-shirts for bitcoins with bitcoin logos and QR codes on them and pass out cards/flyers with links to websites for more info. Letting new people see us using bitcoins to buy things in real life is more powerful than just talking about it.

If it is true that they are a fractional reserve, then it is hard to support them.  I wish them all the best and I hope they sort out all their customers properly, but in my opinion it is too early in the bitcoin ecosystem to provide services with a fractional reserve.

When talking to someone new that is skeptical about bitcoin, I like to start by telling them to imagine what the internet would be like with little to no identity theft.
btw, I really like your show. Keep up the good work.

I think you folks are missing the point, mining won't be profitable once all bitcoins are mined anyways.  You would have to raise transaction fees to cover the costs, and nobody wants that.  There will be mining, but there will be no miners.  Existing miners will need to develop an exit strategy so they don't get rekt.  I could envision a scenario where everyone's router or modem would have a low power mining chip in it, that they don't even know exists, that mines to a mining pool, like their ISP or their local government's pool who will keep the mining fees to offset the need to tax the bitcoin network and would be most interested in running a full node anyways so they can monitor transactions(sorry for the long sentence).
Maybe in the short-term or mid-term there will be some money to be made, but in the long-term maybe the chips will be subsidized by some entity like your ISP or local government.

Well, for bone structure you have the problem of twins, and for DNA you have the problem of someone who is chimera(one person with two sets of DNA).  So make sure you take that into account.

Also, since the tragic goxxing I hear that there is a large OTC market that developed, so these purchases don't affect the exchange price.

Also. keep in mind that criminals don't want bitcoin to go mainstream.  They want it to remain niche, or else they won't have any more credit card numbers to steal.

Not sure if this is short enough, but:
"eliminate identity theft" or "safe shopping"

(sorry for the long post)
I think this is the right time for this, glad to see that BitFury is thinking ahead.  I often hear people say that the fees must increase to support the big miners once all the bitcoins are mined or the block reward is too small to be significant.  
I don't think this is the only scenario. If you think about it, the more you increase the fees, the less people will be using it.  So, will big miners really make enough money from the fees to sustain themselves?  Do big miners really want to bet the farm on the assumption that transactions will reliably increase enough to sustain themselves?  I think there are too many variables to calculate the fees appropriately anyways.  Microtransactions will suffer and all the fun applications we can do with microtranactions goes away.  
This might prompt some big miners to have to close shop.  I hope current miners have an appropriate exit strategy in place anyways so that they don't get too wrecked in the process, but this is where mining might go back to being more decentralized, and this is where I see this BitFury product start to make alot of sense.  
Not as a light bulb though, but I would like to see it in a more always on device like your internet router, or even in the distant future by your ISP in the internet modem they provide you.  Think of everybody plugged into the internet as a mini bitcoin miner.  As long as the impact on your electric bill is insignificant, you wouldn't even have to know that there is a mining device in your house.  There will be mining, but there won't be big miners.  
In a scenario like this, there will be no incentive to squeeze any profits from mining.  And bitcoin can be free of this burden.  Your ISP would still collect the transaction fees, and use them to offset their costs, or to keep bitcoin sales tax free, or maybe devise a way to automatically pay artists for the content they create by tracking torrent downloads, or whatever your tin-foil-hat can come up with.

You still have to trust the game maker to release the goods in a limited quantity without re-leasing more later. It's an interesting problem, but it still might work but might need some regulation to make it work.

Isn't the end game to have no miners?  Once there is a low power mining chip in everyone's internet router, we won't need dedicated mining facilities.  There will be mining, but there won't be miners.  Wasn't the block reward incentive to get the network kickstarted to a secure level and distribute the coins?  Shouldn't miners have a proper exit strategy for when the money grab is over and they don't get wrecked when the block rewards are too low?  I don't think they should be depending on fees to support them.  I think any attempt to leverage fees could become a huge weakness for bitcoin.
Microtransactions could be a big game changer to the internet's ecosystem and I think there is some wonderful innovation to be had in this space.

One possibility is that there will be mining, but there won't be any miners.  What I mean is that if bitcoin actually gains mass adoption, then the norm might be that all our internet routers might be built with a mining chip in them.  These would be low power enough that the power consumption would be practically nothing to the end user.  If every router had a mining chip, we wouldn't need big mining facilities, and It wouldn't matter if the income from transaction fees was profitable or not.  This is what I mean by "there will be mining, but there will no miners".  One advantage to this scenario is that microtransactions would still be viable.

Using bitcoins is the safest way to make transactions in a hostile environment like the internet.
