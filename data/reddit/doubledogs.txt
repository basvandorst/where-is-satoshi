Good, because I'm trying to help the people on /biz/ realize the potential of Bitcoin, and they keep accusing me of shilling. It is very frustrating, because if I hadn't been told about Bitcoin by someone like me, I wouldn't have any. I try to bet, 'if my cold storage hits an exchange within the year, I will give you a BTC' But I had to be sure before posting my address because its more money than I would be willing to lose in such a comically stupid way (if it were possible).

I would buy them, have them shipped, then have them seek asylum. It would be easy for them to get it considering the circumstances. 
If they don't want to be in the country they are in, they could get themselves deported.
People arguing against buying them have a point. But realistically if you don't buy them, others will. It's a cycle you can't break from your position,  but at least you could drive the price higher so fewer people that would actually buy slaves can afford them.
In turn, this incentivises kidnapping because they make more money.

I feel that is incredibly bullish for Bitcoin if true, because really all that happened was morons did moroning, and 750,000 more Bitcoins than would have been expected are already in circulation (assuming the thief sold them as they were). For me,  what this means is that the price being where it is right now is even more justified.

This is the way I look at it, you can tell me if I am wrong, because your reasoning seems fine, but mine seems fine too, and I get somewhere different.
63 = ~64
2^6 = 64
therefore the odds of guessing the bracket are: 2^2^6 to 1
2^2 = 4
2^2 * 2^2^6 = 2^2^8 to 1 &lt;-- the odds of doing it 4 times
A private key is 2^256 
if 2^8 is 256, nevermind I fucked up somewhere... and it is.
Sorry.

I claim that while Bitcoins are property (in the broadest sense possible), they represent a new form of asset that cannot be shoved into the category of 'property' from a tax-law standpoint. 
I would then go on to argue that the laws that currently pertain to physical properties do not pertain to digital properties.

I think the most honest analysis is that the price is down, and people don't really want to spend bitcoins, as it locks in their losses. On the bright side, this indicates that people who own bitcoin still think they are undervalued, even if they aren't buying more.

If I post an address with my coins in it, so people can look at it on the blockchain, there is no way to steal it just from that right?
I know the answer is no, but somebody needs to tell me that I am right, because I have only ever interpolated that, it is never stated outright.

Starbucks has a lot of pull actually. They have a ~40 page standard lease agreement where they basically get to dictate terms because they bring in so much foot-traffic.  They get space for rent at a very small fraction of the nominal price.

Then, if I were able to show that the fundamental values of the universe are related across all instances of our (onmidimensional) time-space, by the ratio of the base unit of dimension (the lowest natural number, 1) to each of the perpendicular dimensions that cross through it at all points that exist, I could patent the resulting equation?
The consequences would be relatively insignificant.

The initial investment is buying goods to sell. It is recouped by selling the good.

Additionally, in what scenario does pure diversification not, at least to some extent, not reduce risk?  Especially when the risks are counter to one another? It's like a collar trade.

Because the cost of transactions is nominally lower than the cost of the electricity from the perspective of the sender already. To the miner, it is much higher, as you already pointed out.
Eventually, as the block reward dwindles, the two prices have to meet at some point. 
Once they meet, the basic economic principles dominating a free market will incentivize the miners who can work cheapest to accept the lowest profitable fee to stay competitive.

Honestly, I only replied because I have a botany degree, so no. Try something like 'Comparing ice cubes to the Principa Matematica'.

I don't see it as a problem. Effectively, what is being done here is voiding of the jackpot payout in the event that somebody wins it. The idea is that you can win any of the other categories, but you aren't ever supposed to make it to the jackpot anyway. Its like making sure that the big jackpot slot-machine only ever pays out a little bit, but you make people think it could give out a lot.
