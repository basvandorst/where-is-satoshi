They dont support Bitcoin..they support alt currencies. Bitcoin can easily be substituted.  This isnt solely about bitcoin. The future is not bright for bitcoin. Get over it.

I worry that the price of bitcoin is staying flat even though all these people are buying in because those at the top of the pyramid are selling off at a rate to match people buying. Think about all the stolen bitcoins that came out of GOX that are and will be sold.

This is the guys that got in early cashing out.  There are fortunes that they are trying to collect on so as soon as the price goes up, they sell to get their money out.

Then when they need more they'll come to us to buy more paddies pub dollars, thus continuing the cycle!

But you could also make friends with them and they would be great pets that you could sell for btc. /on-topic

Wow..terrible mention about tax dodging and then saying its not for illegal uses in the next paragraph.

Bitcoin is still linked to the US dollar, like it or not.  If the government decides to print unlimited amounts to buy bitcoin with, the relative bitcoin to usd price will rise. Even though your transaction method is btc..the end goods you decide to purchase will be priced in btc that is RELATIVE to the cost of the item in USD.  Btc I ONLY a transaction method at this point in time. All products are still sold at USD prices converted to BTC.

Hey Guys, just invested my retirement with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. When do I get my big pay off?
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:46:10
Near zero transaction cost is not something I hace seen. Coinbase and other money transmitters seem to all charge transaction fees similiar to credit cards.

ok, it's been 3 days.  Are you done trolling now or are you still 'traveling'
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:22:12
oh man I'm so selling all my bitcoin now and caching out.  (saying this will make the price rise by fooling the auto trader bots)
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:57:47
Its a trumped up charge. Watch it get dismissed like I dismiss your comment.
@_date: 2014-05-25 23:26:37
Oh man..the bots would simply ignore my comment :(

Disabling jacascript on the client makes it so the 'onClick' method never has a chance to run
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:04:36
But with all that capital they can create wild swings in the price of btc by printing tons of money to buy btc then selling.
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:18:25
The downward pressure is pretty great, considering half of all bitcoins are owned by under 1000 people that have 10 million in USD value:

I see it as a time to buy 2btc
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:37:19
If you were the federal reserve and printed up all your money and bought as much bitcoin as you could, that could cause manipulation in the market like this when you sold.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:20:22
funny to see how happy you are 
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:50:02
Yes, It definitely is an experiment, but so is the fed.  I encourage you to look throughout all the monetary systems of the world and see that the demise came from central planners that printed up their own money to make them and their corporate friends rich. It's time for a new experiment.
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:07:53
the problem we are experiencing and will experience for a long time is that the early adopters got in before 2012 and bought a ton of coins.. the price shot up.  Now they are slowly selling off their bitcoin which is why we see the price going down..   there is a LOT of early investors who want to see USD in their hands so expect this to go on for a very long time.
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:46:13
but what if they just kept buying, so there were new peaks every month with no downs.  bitcoin inflation.  All that printed money could inflate bitcoin prices with no end in sight.  easy.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:55:13
when is that out? dying to watch the full thing!

A chrome extension or similiar sees all your wepaages that appear in your browser. It 'injects' javascript, ie adds some additional client side code to the webpage you are viewing. The exploit runs on every page you visit, so it could be as simple as: if domain=='local bit coins. Com' then inject malware javascript in to html. Then the javascript that was injected just runs on the 'onClick' method for the submit button. When you click the submit button the javascript simply replaces a text field that had your intended address and replaces it with the hackers owned wallet.

Man, the production values on this thing are really great. Great shots, a lot of different high-ranking people, suspensful, there's a story, different sides of the story. I'm very impressed.
