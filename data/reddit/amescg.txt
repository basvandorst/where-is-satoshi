Moving away from snark, let's actually look at this: 


This is a meaningless phrase. A Bitlicense is an individual license, not a constitution; it isn't "violated." What you mean to say is, "If you fail to comply with the Bitlicense requirement...." You're just letting histrionics overpower your writing ability. 


That's not how it works. For better or worse, financial bad guys [don't go to jail]( This is especially so when you consider the limited nature of the regulator and regulations at issue here. DFS's strongest weapon is its ability to [revoke a financial actor's license]( to do business in the State, effectively terminating their economic presence in New York. It's a remedy rarely used. Beyond that, DFS can go to court, and seek an injunction preventing further acts contrary to state law. That's the end of it. No men in black helicopters. No officers with guns drawn. Just paper, court, and lawyers in fancy suits.

I don't think you appreciate what's actually happened here.
Exchange and bank failures are nonoccurrences in the "real" world. When's the last time NASDAQ, the NYSE, or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange froze trading? When's the last time someone's securities were stolen by the exchange? The answer is, never, at least since the SEC and FINRA have existed. What MtGox has done here would be impossible on a regulated exchange.
True, in the fiat world, broker-dealers, traders, and investment banks engage in wrongdoing. But that wrongdoing occurs due to securities manipulation, like insider trading, fraud on the market, improper trading of your account, etc., all of which is redressable through arbitration (FINRA) or litigation (class action).
When wrongs go without correction, it's because a sophisticated party has outmaneuvered you on the law and on the trade (the "Magnetar trade"). You might call that losing "from your own mistakes."
You need to be realistic about regulation and about markets. Right now though, you're trying to rationalize your faith in a system whose dominant feature just cost you big. The system failed. It's time to change the system.

While the "Dormant Commerce Clause" (DCC) angle is a creative one, this vastly overreads the effect of the doctrine. While the DCC forbids states from discriminating against foreign state traffic, and forbids states from setting and enforcing nationwide economic policy -- e.g., Texas tries to prosecute the sale of securities in New York by a Delaware corporation -- [it does NOT forbid states from setting intrastate policy.](
To the contrary, state-level "blue sky" laws have regulated intrastate securities transactions since the early 1900s and, except where preempted by the Securities and Exchange Acts, continue to do so. More on preemption later. 
My understanding of the DFS proposal is that it would require licensing for vendors who wish to sell/trade/etc. virtual currencies to/with/etc. New York state residents. I have a hard time differentiating that from the Martin Act -- the New York act that prohibits securities fraud -- or from any of the various statutes under which DFS licenses other financial actors, like mortgage brokers and banks. 
The article owes its superficial appeal to its conflation of the Dormant Commerce Clause with the doctrine of preemption, under which state regulation is overriden by contradictory federal regulation. The DCC is not a placeholder, and does not preserve the status quo for eventual preemption. It does not say, "the federal government might act, therefore the states may not yet." It is much more specific and narrow.

Hey thanks friend! 
I have to say I'm disappointed in this news too. New York needs a tough, creative regulator and regardless of anyone's opinion on his approach to Bitcoin, Lawsky is definitely that. He's helped a lot of people around the state. Honestly I expect him to return to the public sector eventually. He'll be an NYS Attorney General candidate one day, I would bet, or a successor to Preet Bharara (SDNY US Attorney).

Guys, Cuomo and Lawsky go way back, they're close friends and allies. If you have concerns, a Twitter fracas won't convince either. Focus on a professional, well-organized effort to submit thought-out, impeccably reasoned official comments, and remember that Lawsky's chief interest is consumer protection. As you write them, ask yourself what would persuade him and what would not.

That's the Declaration of Independence. Not the Constitution. The former is a statement of principles. The latter is the second of two forms of government carefully balanced and designed to facilitate those principles.
If you look at the actual Constitution, which I encourage, you'll see the federal government is entitled to take specific actions to facilitate/regulate commerce, and is further entitled to take "necessary and proper" actions towards that end. That's a clear, textual basis for commercial lawmaking.
But we're talking about a New York State government initiative. Take a look through the state's constitution, would you, and find me where it says that running a business without any government interference is a right.

@_date: 2013-05-03 17:40:20
Thanks u/listbyloc, you beat me to this by a few hours. Just a few questions. I'm a lawyer too, but hung up my civil hat for a prosecutor's shield a few years back. Nonetheless, let's see what I remember about damages law. 
* The first thing that stands out to me is that $50m liquidated is enormous in the world of internet currency. Suppose the complaint is true, and MtGox processes $6m of transactions per day. The liquidated damages provision clocks in at eight times the dollar value MtGox *processes* -- not takes in as revenue -- *per day.* Now you've said elsewhere that liquidated damages aren't always enforceable, and that's my experience too. Do you know Washington law in this area? 
* Next, supposing the liquidated damages provision gets penciled down. Aren't the only other damages here consequential, since the relationship never got off the ground? I'm a New York lawyer, and our consequential damages laws are pretty harsh here -- though I've lost cases in arbitration where the panel didn't get that simple goddamn fact -- and I don't see CoinLab's consequentials reaching that high. This boils down to, how much is the American MtGox consumer base actually worth? 
* Lastly, MtGox didn't violate the exclusivity program by going to another vendor. They started to develop the capability themselves. Does internal-innovation constitute breach of an exclusivity agreement? On policy grounds, at least, that sounds grim to me. 
It's too bad there's nothing jurisdictional to worry about here. Jurisdictional arguments are the most fun, and were my specialty :). 
EDIT: Point 3 depends upon the contract, which I really want to see. Is it publicly available?

It will be. A few weeks from now, bust out that PACER. 
To the choice of law question, the complaint alleges that "The agreement provides that it shall be governed, construed and  interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington."
For the life of me, I can't imagine a choice of law question involving a Washington corporation, a Japanese corporation, and a Washington court involving anything but Washington law. Provided Washington rules are up to the 21st century, most regimes *abhor* applying foreign law, and no other domestic jurisdiction has any relationship with the dispute. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:54:44
Moreover, if you're asking why a Japanese business can be sued in Washington state, and not the enforcement of judgments, the answer is that a company generally is subject to suit AT LEAST where its headquarters is, and where it's "purposefully availed itself" of the benefits of the jurisdiction -- here, Washington. In this case if they signed a contract in Washington state designating Washington as the venue, then that's the ballgame.

@_date: 2013-12-16 05:29:39
You bring up a very good idea: state-law deceptive practice regulations. Kansas's version -- [here]( -- looks fairly robust. Consider section (b)(6), which penalizes a supplier's sale "without intent to supply reasonable, expectable public demand." Section 50-634 then provides for a private right of action by class, for damages, in some limited case. Proving loss and causation would then be the largest part. 
This would be interesting to look into further. I'm an NY govt. attorney or I'd want to pursue this case myself.

For one, if they represented the exchange as a 24/7 system that would never be interrupted, then.... freezing the markets for 12 hours, during which Bitcoins will lose 1/2 of their value, could expose them to liability for fraudulent misrepresentation. You might also ask, why did [UBS get sued for freezing the ARS markets.](
The "big boy" defense sometimes works, yes. But sometimes it doesn't. 
Remember, I'm not saying this is a winning argument. All I'm saying is that it's NOT laughable, and it is something that Bitcoin True Believers should consider when they talk about Bitcoins' future.

You're being flamed into oblivion by a bunch of Bitcoin zealots, but that isn't fair, especially because zealotry is a bad way to approach an investment-grade item. 
(I understand that a lot of you are in this for The Cause, but some of us aren't. No reason to hate us for recognizing a different sort of value in Bitcoin, eh?)
Now, ahem, American (NY) attorney here. I venture I've taken a few more securities regulation classes than any of the people insulting you, so let me see if I can help. 
***TLDR:*** *Just because it's the internet doesn't mean it's not within the ambit of the law. Yours is a good and interesting question that people interested in the future of Bitcoin should ask.*
It's true that Bitcoin/Mt.Gox are not regulated by American agencies, like the SEC or CFTC. But that they're not in the system means little for private litigants -- it really means nothing more than that neither of them can file for an IPO, and aren't covered by a limited set of statutes designed for stocks. It doesn't foreclose some types of litigation, because, under American law, you ***can*** still enforce securities laws against private actors if the defendant issued something that shares key characteristics of a security. An item might be a security if it involves a situation where: 
* an individual invests his money 
* in a common enterprise, and 
* is led to expect profits
* based solely on the efforts of the promoter or a third party.
Neither Bitcoin nor Mt.Gox really offer any instrument fitting that test. So under American law, they both *may* fall out of the securities regime. But that doesn't end the analysis.
Stock/securities law is just one of many types of financial regulation under American law. To me, I think, Bitcoin behaves a *lot* like a commodity. I know less of plaintiff-side commodities litigation than I do about the system as a whole, but there *are* private rights of action under American law for those who invest in 
* a commodity, that is
* traded on an exchange
Now, whether the same is true under Japanese law, I don't know. One of your (many) problems in making an argument under Japanese law, I suspect, might be jurisdiction. So you might face an uphill battle.
But there ARE laws that potentially cover Bitcoin, and yes, I bet some of those are Japanese laws. This is a good question that people should ask, if only because someone, maybe not you, will ask a court to decide it at some point. Guaranteed. If you think people don't sue over internet money, you're wrong.

By way of comparison, when the auction rate securities market froze in 2010, the value crashed, and it was never the same.
I suspect that won't happen here, because of (1) true believers and (2) people like me, who are waiting to get in on what they believe will be a brief crash. Just a thought. I for one can't wait for my $110 bitinstant order to clear, so it will actually get me something of value!
Also, this is a high-risk situation for mtgox. As a junior lawyer I assisted in the representation of a major bank that dealt in ARS. The fallout was immense. Billions in fines, liability to traders in the hundreds of millions. If mtgox doesn't have good SecReg lawyers yet, they should.

Ron Paul **is** a fringe politician with loony head-in-the-cloud policies. Before you downvote and move on, please actually read and consider. Simply put:
Paul is loved by communities like Reddit because he's viewed as a wonky truth-teller with counterintuitive but appealing ideas. Like us. He's loved by libertarians because.... He's a libertarian. But neither descriptor is adequate to explain him.
Fundamentally, Ron Paul is a politician who is deeply uneasy with modernity. This trait, and this alone, fully describes his behavior. Consider:
* He's anti-net neutrality... because he supports "freedom" (??)
* He denies the danger of global warming
* He opposes the use of federal power to confront even those challenges that, without it, would prove intractable -- like civil rights
In these and other ways, Paul has failed to learn the lesson of the 20th century: that government is a common, but not exclusive threat to individual liberty. Hence, deregulation, without regard for the historical fact that this exchanges the economic freedom of the poor for that of the rich; free corporate speech without consideration of the effect it has on individual speech; etc.
This 19th century thinking makes Paul the wrong spokesman for a new technology that will have to make or break itself within 21st century rules.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:50:11
Thanks!! The problem is that it creates the illusion of liquidity, may affect the weighted average price, and creates the illusion of price changes (or of stability) at a price set by the traders.
The additional problem, unique to Bitcoin, is that it could create lag and force out bona fide traders, who miss out on a market price because of lag.
I should stress that not all HFT is bad, and Bitcoin needs to be prepared for traders who don't manipulate it, but benefit from it as a source of high-speed arbitrage opportunities.

Always a good reason. If you like that, you might like his other "bitter" songs -- [Entertainer]( and [Everybody Loves You Now.]( Good times. 
Now, thanks again, and goodnight and good luck in whatever mess shortly ensues!

It's not that HFTs are inherently bad. It's that HFT could mask "wash" trades -- zero-net-value trades between conspirators -- that artificially inflates volume and therefore price. There's a reason that's illegal in commodities/stock markets.

Awesome. I'll try it too and report back. I assume if they don't play fair reddit will destroy their reputation.... So I hope it works!

For what it's worth, you're right :)

If he was a scammer, he was an odd one. I bought, but he didn't send, so I filed a dispute immediately........ 
And he returned my payment??? Also immediately?????? Saying it was a problem with Coinbase?????
The whole thing is very odd. I too was suspicious of the "gift" thing, but thought I could lawyer my way around it if push came to shove. Luckily, it didn't. 
Still, never Paypal'ing for coins again.

I think there would be a basis for splitting Investment vs. Advocacy forums.

Ah. So when they say they honor rates, they mean, they honor the weighted average?
If so, that's nuts. If it was posted when I ordered, I could buy now between $110-20. But the average is $50-60 above that!

Yes and no. Class actions are vehicles to enforce the law by making civil-rule breaking costly. It is true that restitution for victims is often a secondary concern. My CivPro professor analogized class actions to legal privateering, for example -- so they're not inconsequential. They're just more negatively consequential for rule-breakers than they are positively consequential to plaintiffs.

I am a lawyer, and view this as a potentially avoidable issue. It all depends on how the site represents the "advice" they provide. If they're cautious to note that it does not result in an attorney/client relationship, malpractice would not lie, as the provision of nonspecific advice does not always entail "practice." 
Basically, the ethical rules have long made leeway for the provision of "general" legal information that falls short of "advice," in that it is insufficiently particularized to an individual client's case. To translate, consider these two statements:
* "Malpractice is a legal wrong, called a tort, that may be actionable, and a botched appendectomy may come within the definition of malpractice." 
* "You, John Doe, should sue for malpractice, because that doctor botched your appendectomy." 
I have no problem saying that the second will likely constitute legal advice. It's not clear to me that the first, however, would. See, e.g., this 2001 [Harvard Law Journal publication](  For a more updated perspective, see [this](
What I'm getting at is, Coinlaw would need to be very careful about the kind of information they allow to be shared on their site. It might require more management than they think, because a registered attorney responding to a malpractice inquiry with Answer  could cause problems for the site and the attorney. 
By the way, I would be very happy to help them (you?) navigate these waters. Informally, of course :).
