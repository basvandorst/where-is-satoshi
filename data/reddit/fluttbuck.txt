No, its about my inability to seal a bitcoin node in concrete because PHORK!!!eleventy111

blk*.dat files are not blocks...
@_date: 2015-12-14 08:24:47
And then... how do you know or trust what Bitcoin values are being reported to correspond with your keys? If you don't verify the whole blockchain yourself you have to trust somebody else.

Why all of a sudden are these low life screaming for forks to piggyback altcoins on top of Bitcoin. 
First Blockstream wants BIP66 strict signature encoding and BIP65 OP_HODL. Fine, those are really soft forks. Now though they push for segregated witness which could be soft only through definitions which require substantial LSD to digest along with still more accessory crud. This Sergio comes out sees the fork talk and asks for more forks too.
Get these motherfucking snakes out of my motherfucking bitcoin!

FORTH is fun. FORTH machines even more fun.

Likely this. A full node eats more resources than Google likes to offer on free thing by miles.

Found the fatty.

Signature verification and keeping up with the blockchain starts to get iffy. It's also iffy on the raspberry pi. If a blocksize increase were forked there'd be a serious risk of not keeping up.

No. US IMAGINES IT HAS JURISIDICTION BECAUSE US SMOKE CRACK.
CIA INVENT CRACK. FBI SMOKE CRACK. OBAMA BULLY SMALL COUNTRIES.

It's an actual organization maintaining a bitcoind client. They forked from the 0.5.3 codebase and it keeps up on the present blockchain.
Also that's a serious software license. As we are all born into sin and crime that license merely makes you acknowledge that.
@_date: 2015-12-14 02:52:49
0.5.4 isn't looking so bad after all is it?
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:47:50

Different problems with BitPay, because they don't have enough employees left to be nosy like CoinBase.

Prolly time to start an AI at this point in your cycle. Last thing you want is to be that ripped guy who is mad cut and swole yet possesses his own pair of tits to fondle.

What was this author smoking to grammar so bad? My Cointelegraph seems to be getting desperate for authors.
@_date: 2015-10-08 00:20:57
Snore, old news.

They are trying to brute force your site via the xmlrpc login method. Delete xmlrpc.php and you'll be much safer.
@_date: 2015-10-22 06:19:11
0conf was never a thing. That it appeared to be for a short period of recorded history is an accident.
@_date: 2015-11-25 03:13:25
Better to just delete xmlrpc.php and be done with it. Nothing it contains is essential to running a blog. All it does it contain bullshit which either makes your site vulnerable to attack or a nuisance to other sites (the pingback DDOS).
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:01:29
Because CoinBase is a criminal gang working with law enforcement?
@_date: 2015-10-12 21:15:01
Consider consulting [the Bitcoin News for some leads?](
@_date: 2015-10-08 02:30:03
Have you tried Aricept for your dementia yet?
@_date: 2015-10-08 00:01:00
Not at all. The zero-conf could ever be safe myth simply has to die.
@_date: 2015-10-06 08:07:13
BitPay's kinda suffering because it really hasn't been.
@_date: 2015-11-25 03:14:18
CoinFire, Cointelegraph, even Qntra gets hit with DDoS
@_date: 2015-10-20 06:31:02
A lot of this. A lot of how much do you trust that last layer of encryption. Probably safer with Cichlid storage.
@_date: 2015-11-25 04:06:49
@_date: 2015-11-25 16:19:24
Or... You could not post author pictures if this is a concern?
@_date: 2015-10-14 05:54:09
Probably  if you don't know how to expand that acronym just lurk moar for a bit.
@_date: 2015-10-07 23:13:18
Increase minrelaytxfee to 0.001
This will keep many transactions from being admitted to your node's mempool including nearly all spam attack transactions.
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:30:25
This trash left Bitcoin, let it starve.
@_date: 2015-11-28 05:43:16
Sorry, wrong subreddit maybe? Usually gyno is a bigger issue in other subs.
@_date: 2015-10-16 01:04:02
It's especially weird because the Government was the major victim of a substantial part of Mark Force model IV's crimes.

Find me any other censorship resistant money that can settle across continents in less than days!
@_date: 2015-10-08 02:12:22
And it could get forked off of the actual Bitcoin network, no thanks.
