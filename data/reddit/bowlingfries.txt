I bought a new $400 laptop the day before bitcoin hit 8200 then went to like 13k. I cried internally, to this day as I sit and type this on that crappy laptop, I regret that choice. I could've bought a much nicer laptop!

maybe im going in on this half cocked. Ill have to make sure theres no cryptocurrency exclusions. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:43:18
Thank you this is awesome, tell me though does it work only with having a btc balance or would eth and ltc also be able to be used?
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:10:36
I do not have a miner so I'm not positive on how it would work. To be clear I don't know for sure if it's possible but if it is, someone knows how to do it.  
Best of Luck.

Is there a way to have someone with a mining rig plug in the transaction hash and manually confirm it?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:43:28
Because that would be gambling. Lol.

The way I see it: I would rather be on the line for thousands of dollars for buying something truly valuable like bitcoin. I dont need the loans for school or living expenses. Id rather be holding onto bitcoin, cause it could substantially increase in value. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:41:53
Wish me luck right? Ill be wishing you luck as well assuming youre hodling through this thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:40:49
I realize the decision isnt recommended. I am a moron if I lose everything. Im a hero if it works out how Im betting it will.

Guys made you look, its the finger circle

I merely am posing a scenario, not trying to pass it as fact. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:28:02
Hey if market sentiment demands it, why shouldnt it work?
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:47:39
sadly no, i asked
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:27:46
I thought that same thing! Good job acting on it homie

This guy was the reason way back in june i put 100 usd into bitconnect. I knew nothing about crypto yet but I knew that first You gotta buy some. So I did. It was not much but I knew  I was going to lose it as soon as I clicked to send it to bitconnect. Nevertheless I always pulled out the money when it was available. I managed to recoup the 100usd i put in... By that time, had i just held onto that bitcoin it wouldve been around 1000 usd.
I know its not much but all the other people that put in alot more, the lives that got ruined..  So serves these guys right that theyre resorting to going on the run and trying to cover it up. They deserve every moment of fear they incurr from all this. They surely caused more pain than theyll ever be delt in punishment.

Now all i need is for it to go up ;)
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:18:33
youre probably correct
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:00:50
though it may not all together erase the need for collaborative the foot at the same time it can certainly reduce how much of it is required in order to still be efficient. Is certainly all together could save loads of money. I mean I ride around the city and just behold all the empty Office Buildings and floors with no lights on it would seem that was all space built for for nobody to occupy. just a waste of building to help move a dollar. i hope through all of the blockchain adoptance we will see drastic shifts in how resources both tangible and intangible are allocated to better serve its function at much less cost. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:14:04
Yeah for real, most likely because the whole market is down so much. i would imagine they are hemoraging money, perhaps even struggling to function as they should for end user safety. Hopefully not that.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:13:27
then i cant wait for the rebound
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:15:29
i went through and calculated that all out, knew that it was unsustainable and still i threw in my chips
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:35:27
Does this mean eventually we will see the first mother of all drops eventually in this logarithmic graph? like 2.000.000 down to 200.000?
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:48:22
I may have a skewed view of what a city is at its core. But i see them as a place people come together and conduct business/collaborate. With decentralization of our world information management, the need to come together in these hubs (cities) would progressively deminish, no?

Might want to look into your product if its truly 0%. I remember from some research I was doing into the cbd space that it literally needs some thc to be more effective. Particularly thca thats the active incredient which gives the cbd its healing effects.

Please explain what exactly negative yeild is describing.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:52:18
like i said, i knew when i invested it i was goong to loose the money. Well i had a feeling, but yes i did it anyway.
