Why do you think the tax plan will plunge us into recession? When we have a recession, it'll mostly be the cause of the past 10 years of central banking's actions of artificially low interest rates and increased monetary supply that's been artificially inflating everything. This is one of the main reasons bitcoin was created. 
"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with hardly a fraction in reserve.”

I think technology is the fastest means for evolution especially when there's a demand for it. Can crypto evolve fast enough to go mainstream when we're suddenly hit with a recession? No idea. It'll be interesting I'm sure though!

The tax cuts will definitely add to our already overleveraged debt so it'll probably speed up the start of the next recession. My fear though is that people will blame the tax cuts as the root cause and just think electing a different party will solve our woes. However if they understand the true nature of the problem and lose faith in central banking, they'll definitely look to crypto.

Plus if that tax plan goes through, the standard deduction will be doubled. Most people won't even be able to take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction unless all their other deductions are greater than the standard deduction.

I was one of the lucky few that got to use the beta. It's pretty awesome and really easy to use.

True but why hit the ATM multiple times in one day?

You also own 100 million satoshis! Congrats!

Not if you're buying $10 a week.

If he's smart enough to figure out time travel, I would think he'd be smart enough to read the historical price charts and give more specific prices if he really wanted to convince. Or something like "trump won in 2016".

I always think of how many satoshis I'm buying rather than how much bitcoin. Right now $50 buys over a million satoshis.

How about 0.00000001 btc?

I think of how many Satoshis I'm buying/have. $50 dollars gets you about 1 million Satoshis. Seems like a steal. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:11:52
Think of a potential future where 1 Satoshi=1 penny. I wouldn't mind having a million pennies that I only paid $50 for

Sure we have nice things but they were mostly bought with debt. All Dr. Paul is saying is that the constraints of reality are lifted when you have infinite access to credit. The immediate effect is a combination of good &amp; bad (war &amp; technology). The real question is when we finally feel the true effects of unpayable/massive debt, will we be more better off than we would have been with a constrained monetary system for all this time? My guess is that if central banking never happened we'd have less shiny things but our society would be one more sustainable and based on reality.
