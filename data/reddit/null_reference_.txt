Have you ever wondered why gold is the historical and internationally recognized store of value? Assuming that such a thing is ***bound*** to exist, why not silver, or copper, or diamonds? Why gold specifically? You might be thinking it's arbitrary, but it isn't: 
* Gold doesn't rust, corrode, or decay.
Gold is a stable element that retains it's mass and physical properties in natural conditions. Floods, fires, and prolonged exposure to air will not meaningfully reduce the amount of gold you own. ***This makes it a secure long term store of value.***
* Gold is fungible
Unlike diamonds, any combination of pieces of gold is equal in value to any other combination. A gold bar is not worth more than a bucket of gold nuggets with the same weight. There is no "ideal specimen" of gold, and thus no subjective interpretation of value. ***This makes golds value independent from the current "best" specimen of its kind.***
* Gold is found in many places
Unlike other precious metals, the distribution of gold veins worldwide is relatively more even. This makes it harder for regional monopolies to form, aiding in international trade. ***This quality makes gold universally valuable and independent of regional political influence.***
* Gold is very dense, and very soft
Gold is one of the densest and therefore heaviest precious metals, making it more difficult to counterfeit. It is also soft, and easy to work into the form of coins or jewelry, aiding fungibility and lowering overhead cost of currency production. ***This makes gold more reliable in small transactions*** 
All this to say that some stores of value are better than others. Historically, gold is better than diamonds because it is more fungible and is found in more places. It's better than copper because it does not oxidize in natural conditions. It's better than government backed currency because it's not dependent on that government's current level of political sway. And it's better than titanium because it's heavier and therefore more difficult to counterfeit.
In the case of bitcoins versus fucking *baseball cards....* Bitcoins are more fungible, produced in more places, more difficult to counterfeit, and a more secure store of value. Unlike baseball cards they can be transferred digitally, they can't be destroyed in a fire or flood, their value is not dependent on regional subjective value, and do not deteriorate over time. 
TL;DR Your analogy is shit, and you don't have to agree with OP's lofty and optimistic vision of bitcoins future to see why

You could have said that last time as well, and you would have been wrong. 
There is a ceiling to the value of bitcoin, and we will hit it eventually. And when we hit it, we will likely surpass it, and the value will settle back down over time to where bitcoin is valued. You say thats happening now, I say that hasn't happened yet. Neither of us are "right" until we are proven right in the future, that is the nature of speculation. 
I don't see anything that distinguishes this value drop from the others, and so I don't see any reason to change my long term plans.

You say that like this is the first time this graph has been posted during a value drop.  
I've been following bitcoin since $20 was the all time high, and every time the value starts to fall the fair weather speculators dump their coins and start predicting doom and gloom on their way out the door. But for me this is business as usual. It happened when the 20$ dollar bubble popped to $5, it happened with the 80$ bubble popped down to $40, it happened when the $250 bubble popped down to $90, and when the $1,000 bubble popped to $500.
I think bitcoin is undervalued on the long scale, which is why I held through the $250 collapse, and it's [why I'll hold now.](

You have to understand that the people at the bank deciding whether or not to reverse the charges have little to no idea what bitcoins are, and possibly even thinks of them as a scam.
When a bank employee gets a call from a customer like this:


The charges are going to get reversed.
And that's just from scammers, thieves present an even bigger problem. Think of how easy it would be to steal a co-workers credit card out of their purse, and put it back five minutes later $500 dollars richer. Then your co-worker notices the charge and tells the bank it wasn't theirs, so the bank reverses it. From circles perspective, there is no way to know if she is a victim of theft or one of the scammers described above.
You can't reverse the bitcoins, so either circle, the cardholder, or the bank is out $500. And it sure as fuck won't be the bank.

I never actually bought any bitcoins myself. I was curious about them way back in the day and mined a bunch. Back when mining on consumer level computers was feasible and people complained if they were mining less than 5 coins per day. I was more interested in the technical side of them, like how they could be used as a videogame currency in an MMO or something. I never imagined they would be worth more than a dollar.
Then I forgot about them completely until I saw a post somewhere talking about how the value had spiked to $20 USD per coin.
And I had about 250 of them.....    
That was a good day......
So I was pretty lucky, but being the pessimist that I am I can't help but be annoyed that I didn't spend all that money on more coins when the value dipped to $4 dollars. If I had, I would have made over $60,000 dollars that may as well have dropped out of the sky.
*Oh and if for any reason this post is used in the court of law, I lost it all by stupidly investing in other crypto currencies with my cache of bitcoins. Which is of course why none of this was on my tax return.*

Except each "pop" is still above what the value was before the spike in price.
* At one point it went from $4 to $20, then it "popped" and landed at $10.
* It climbed from $10 to $30 and then "popped" and landed in the low $20's
* It climbed from there to an unprecedented $260, and then "popped" to $90.
Every time there is a new all time high people get more comfortable buying at a value larger than they were before. People were wary of buying coins for $50 - $60 a month ago, now people would kill for coins that cheap.
The confidence goes up with each all time high. People are more willing to bet that it will ***return*** to $200, than they are willing to speculate on a theoretical yet unattained ceiling.
There should be a new rule: You can't call a value spike a "*bubble*" without predicting what the value will be after it pops. My coins are still worth 3 times what they were worth a month ago, popping bubbles and all.

Oh boy does this hit close to home.
Me and my wife go through this with our families all the time. The entitled little shits always find a way to rationalize reasons why we should fork over more money to them, why they shouldn't have to pay money we have lent them back, why they shouldn't have to make payments on things they part own anymore.




Next time we go over to the house, a brand new $1,000 flatscreen is sitting in the living room... So either they lied to our face, or they borrowed money from us to offset their ridiculous spending practices.
Do not give them a god damn thing. You don't owe them shit. People don't get a medal and a prize basket for raising a kid they decided to have. I don't know how old you are, but I have been dealing with family like this for quite some time and I have some tips:
* Don't tell them how much money you have or make. Ever. Let them speculate. You can learn a lot about how they view you by what they assume your income is.
* **Never, ever** lend cash to them. No matter what ridiculous sob story they have concocted. They ***WILL*** come up with an excuse to not pay it back. Or pay it back over a longer time, or less than you lent. It is astounding how far back in your history they will go to rationalize these things. A dinner they sprung for 5 years ago, when you didn't have quarters for the toll road, when they helped you move that dresser. The bullshit reasons they come up with to justify saying "I lend money to you all the time!" even when you both know they don't would be impressive if it wasn't so shameless.
* Never part own anything with them. They will *"Not be able to make the payment this month"* or *"You use it more anyway"* or *"You can have it"* there way out of the agreement eventually. And what do you want to bet "You can have it" doesn't mean "I will sign over my half of the ownership to you". And when you go to sell it, suddenly the 10% they put in entitles them to half the money you get from selling it, and them not paying anymore was *"your idea"* or *"You were fine with it"* anyway.
* If you are feeling charitable and want to help them with a problem they have, make a check out to the source of their problems, not them. They say they are having trouble paying for food? Buy them grocery store gift cards. Electric company hassling them? Write a check to the electric company, not to them. Never just hand them a pile of cash. They were lying as to why they needed it, and how much they needed. Every time, guaranteed.
And I guess the biggest piece of advice I can give, that supersedes all the others, is cleave the toxic people from your life. If you don't enjoy their company, and they treat you poorly, don't let our cultures obsession with familial unity compel you to remain in a social circle that you feel no true affinity for. If this isn't an isolated incident (and honestly I would be shocked that otherwise normal parents would have an outburst like this) then tell them to fuck off.
Just leave. Ignore their phone calls. Don't show up to family gatherings. It isn't just your money you don't owe them, you don't owe them your time either.

Well yes, he can see where the bitcoins have moved. But the existence of person C and D is pure conjecture from his perspective. All he knows is it was transferred from one address to another address. But there are a lot of different things that could signal.
Person B could be moving it to another address he owns, transferring it to someone else, selling it at an exchange, moving it to cold storage, sending it through an obfuscator like bitfog, etc. It could be anything. 
All person A can see is that they were transferred. There is no way to distinguish between selling the coins on an exchange or moving them to another address he owns. It all looks the same on the blockchain.

If you wouldn't take the same money to the roulette table and put it all on red, don't put it in bitcoin. No one knows what is going to happen, bitcoin is a new frontier. That said, now is a great time to buy in.
 * Don't try to daytrade, you will lose money or potential profit. 
 * Don't panic sell during crashes, wait for it to bounce back. If you can't handle that stress or risk I refer you back to the roulette table.
 * Seriously, DONT TRY TO DAYTRADE. You WILL lose money and potential profits in the long run unless you know what you are doing.
 * You won't be paying off your house with the take. You won't get rich, don't expect to. This isn't the lottery. 
If bitcoins made it to $1,500 there would still be people asking "Did I miss the boat?". There were people asking that when they were worth $20, which sounds hilarious today. Maybe asking this today at $130 a piece will seem equally hilarious in 2015. There is no telling.

Bitcoins were worth more than their current value of $110 (as of typing) for only 3 days.

A 1oz gold coin can't be used anywhere either, that doesn't stop it from being worth over $1,000 USD.

Yeah if you had a crystal ball that told you when those drops were coming and where they would stop. 
But since crystal ball technology is decades away.. you are exactly as likely to lose money as you are to gain it if you try to daytrade using only the current value as a metric.
I mean think about it. If you think it is going to drop 30 dollars (like it did yesterday), so you sell, but it raises 30 instead (like it did the day before), you will lose as much money buying back at the now higher price as you would have made buying at the lower price you mistakenly predicted was coming.
If you are right 10 times and wrong 11, you lost money. And you won't be right 10 times. Not if you don't take into account market volume, resistance, support etc..

Bitcents, regardless of abbreviation problems, are far, FAR, ***FAR*** easier to understand. People will immediately and intrinsically understand what a "bitcent" is. It is clearly and obviously a smaller division of a bitcoin, and anything that speeds up the process of explaining bitcoins should be utilized to its fullest.
satoshis, mBTC or what ever other logical on paper denomination are a terrible idea for a technology that depends so entirely on adoption.
Also worth noting is verbal use of a word, which is an important aspect to consider.




Ensures that the terminology is consistant. In contrast, this:




Creates unnecessary confusion and is a mouthful. The term "bitcoin" is more comparable to the term "dollar". People are more likely to say "I have 5 dollars" than they are "I have 5 USD". Piggy backing on the general knowledge of what a "cent" is removes another hurdle of confusion.

So much of the FUD about bitcoins come from people reading *headlines* and not *articles*. Internet dwellers who don't actively research bitcoins only interaction with the concept is the following:
* **Bitcoin value crashes overnight!**  ...Click to continue reading.
* **Why bitcoins are a bubble..** ...Click to continue reading.
* **Bicoins get hacked once again...** ...Click to continue reading.
* **Joe Schmo shares his story about losing $10,000 in bitcoins** ...Click to continue reading.
They don't open the articles, let alone read rebuttals or comments. They don't know that the "crash" still left bitcoins doubled in value from the previous week. They don't know that it was an ***exchange*** that was hacked and not bitcoins themselves. They don't know that Joe Schmo's "$10,000 loss" was not a loss at all, but only a smaller profit to him than it could have been since he regrets selling his coins at $50 instead of $200.
They don't know any of that. They just take the editorialized headline at face value, think to themselves: 


upvote the post, and move along. It is perpetual self imposed ignorance. And to make things worse, the positive articles about bitcoin either don't convey that in the title, or are so grandiose and over the top it just sounds like zealotry to someone who at this point is convinced they are a tulip/ponzi-scheme/pyramid-scheme/scam/worthless/drug-money.

* **Why banks are just *terrified* of bitcoins.** ...Click to continue reading.
The reason people are so negative towards bitcoin is because they understand nothing about them, have no desire to try, and "they have heard" that they are a [negative economic jargon]. They are looking for reasons not to bother caring or researching bitcoins and print media provides that in spades.

What intermediary do you use to transfer USD between the two exchanges?
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:09:44
* Vendors have to pay a deposit ($500 I think) to get listed on the site. So they would have to be able to rip off people for more than that amount for it to be worth it. Silk Road purchases tend to be small, so this thwarts a lot of scamming attempts right of the bat. The site uses this deposit to reimburse victims of scamming.
* Vendors have ratings and reviews, and only a small percentage of users are willing to risk money on new vendors. As a result, often a new vendor has to offer free products to get the ratings and comments they need to entice the user base to trust them. So at the very least, you can be sure that the person is capable of providing the product they claim.
* The Silk Road holds the coins in escrow until the delivery is made, so the risk is actually on the side of the vendor, since the user can claim they never received the product. For this reason, vendors often don't sell to new users. If a new user is buying from a well established vendor typically the vendor will require that the user FE (finalize early) or refuse to do business with them. 
* Most vendors and users require that shipping adresses and any identifying information be transferred with an encryption service, so if a seller gets busted there isn't a list of their customers just sitting around somewhere.
* As for shipping security, a vendor who gets a review from a customer who claims that the packaging was not secure enough is ten times worse than one claiming they didn't receive it at all. So vendors are very motivated to properly seal and obfuscate the products they are sending.
So to put it bluntly, there is very much a risk of losing money. But this is always the case, even in lawful business. The system the Silk Road has in place is well thought out, and ensures that the vast majority of transactions run smoothly.

The value will power through to the mid 90's in the next couple of days, where it will remain for over a week due to the "wall". It will not hit 100 (right now), and will stop at 94 - 96.
After that, a slight drop to the mid 80's will cause a subsequent massive drop down to the 50 - 65 range, where it will stay for a few days.
Then, comfortable that the drop has hit its floor, those who cashed out before or during the drop will begin buying again, bringing the price back up to the high 80's low 90's, where it will stay relatively stable for a frustratingly long time.
This will henceforth be known as "the prophecy of the great one" if it turns out to be what happens, and if it isn't what happens then I was just kidding.

Pretty good talk IMO. I much prefer when they avoid the technical discussions behind how the system works and focus on what it is for and what it can do.
Because honestly, I work in software and still have trouble completely grasping how it all functions. I am not sure I could really explain to someone how the mining process works on a technical level.
I just trust that other more qualified programmers would throw a massive fuss if the open source code had something nefarious in it.

Expecting stability from such a new commodity is, wishful thinking, to put it kindly. The volatility isn't going anywhere any time soon.
No, there is nothing we can do. More importantly there is no reason we should try. And if a group as small as this subreddit did have enough organization and sway over the value of bitcoins we would be using it to make ourselves richer, not artificially slowing its rise in value for no discernible reason.

These events? The bitcoin user community is [95% male.]( And saying we should "make it more appealing to women" implies that there is just a few window dressings we could put on to entice these elusive and otherwise disinterested females to take interest.
The bitcoin community is very utilitarian and on topic, nothing about it is specifically male or anti-female. It isn't like r/gaming where the front page is plastered with naked videogame heroines or sexual innuendo that makes the whole thing look like a boys club. People here and on the popular bitcoin forums are incredibly on topic.
The fact of the matter is the bitcoin community is largely dominated by people in software engineering/IT and economists/investors. Two fields dominated by men for reasons far beyond the bitcoin community being vaguely and undefinably "unwelcoming" to women.
Although I do agree that title and wager is pretty distasteful to say the least, it just rubs me wrong to hear it implied that it is something the bitcoin community is doing that turns women away. The lack of women in the bitcoin community is a symptom of a much larger cultural problem that is impervious to any attempt by us to be "more appealing" to women.

I sent 6 requests, called their phone number, and waited in line for what I now suspect is a fake livechat system, and nothing worked. 
To put it simply, they don't *have* customer support. Not as far as I can see. The support staff for Mt.Gox and Bitstamp were in constant communication with me the entire time, but bitinstant *still* hasn't returned a single email.

As a programmer, I assure you that programmers would throw a fucking fit if the source code contained anything nefarious or negligent.
Programmers *LOVE* picking apart other peoples work. The programmer that was on a project before them is always *THE WORST PROGRAMMER EVER*. 
Bitcoins are a bit over my head, or at least out of my area of expertise, but just from knowing programmers I can tell you with certainly that if there was something like this in the code the biggest problem would be the hundreds of code monkeys arguing with each other over who found it first.
