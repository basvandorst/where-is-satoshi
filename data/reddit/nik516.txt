So we should all stop using bitcoin because we may be upset the price may grow? Well fuck what will raise the price if not the currency being used ?

Very true , I want to stop the corruption but we cannot over hype bitcoin because the corrupt people we want to stop will use bitcoin to rip us off at the end . nothing smart about being over hyped.

Why do we have pictures of people brains , like if you think this is true you must be smart . 
Bitcoin may do this , nothing is a guarantee . and nothing stops the current banks creating a cryptocurrency and forcing them selves onto the marker with discounts or perks if you use the banks cryptocurrency. 
Let's not get into a circle jerk with this guys and girls, use caution. 
Bitcoin is not apple or google it has no physical value without its user base so keep an eye on what is happening with the world around it.

You did but the value is in the use of bitcoin, if you cannot use it to buy property , vehicles , food at supermarkets ,  and if its not adopted everywhere its has failed. 
So you are right it needs the value.

Your right the only way to prop the base for then peak is to get new investors and the people on the peak have probably sold during the increases so they are holding tight as they have lost no investment. 
The other factor is as bitcoin has become public so have the issue with bitcoin e.g hacking and scams and bitwallet closures. And since its now in the public light it will be more heavily scritabized and manipulated by main stream media. 
Look what happened when the main stream media stared talking about bitcoin , prices went up. They can also kill off bitcoin in the same way.
