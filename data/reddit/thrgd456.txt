It is formulaic. It is very stiff writing. I am still shocked at how poorly written news articles can be published. I can't believe that an adult would have written that and  then an editor would have decided to publish it.
The information in the article is just dropped onto the reader without any context or validation or intention. There is no point to it. What is the direction? What is the point?
It reads like it was GREP'ed, not written. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:25:58
This article reads like it was written by an algorithm. Terrible. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:39:24
There's a lot of gamble involved. No doubt.
But you understand that crypto is a way for people to transfer and store monetary units without using banks, right? Without banks.
Kind of like how cell phones let us take, retain and view pictures with using film. You see the comparison between Kodak and retail banking.

I saw someone advising another to max out their credit cards to buy BTC. My god , how stupid can you be? There is no, NO protection with BTC and it has very real and very powerful enemies.

Is there ever a reason?

I'm happy for you. Perhaps, even if you cannot envision it, you will desire to hold and transfer wealth on a peer-to-peer network.  That's why we do it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:57:54
First of all, BTC isn't an investment. It's a type of currency. (I know, I know). An investment would have been if you had purchased a mining rig. That's an investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:01:53
I hope so

I got in at 440. I'm pretty sure I'm still up a fair bit.

Sell? Why would you sell? What would you sell? Do you sell dollars for Yen and expect to get rich? If one removes the market manipulation then one is left with currency trading on a privately owned network. The only real opportunity for a profit by trading is through arbitrage. There is a small opportunity there but as we are now seeing that entire market can be dumped. But the core BTC users and producers haven't been hurt. The mining farms are still running. BTC is still being used to purchase real world goods and services. The world is still spinning. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:23:53
Same. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:45:55
I think you are missing the point of crypto currency 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:23:47
You seem confused. Which part was confusing to you? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:38:16
You just need to reboot your block chain. Sometimes they stick in the cold weather. Two drops of fine machine oil in your gpu sling every month will keep your chain from stalling again. Best of luck to you!
p.s. If that doesn't work just bring me your wallet and keys and I'll tune it up for you.

This is pure truth.

This is part of a larger movement to attack the freedom of crypto. This sub is now experiencing social engineering for the pro-regulation forces.

Your money is never safe. Unless you consider "slowly shrinking in a savings account" to be safe. 
BTC is high risk. We all know that. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:49:02
The hatred/fear of Bitcoin is not ungrounded.  The older generation of fund managers and major investment entities look at Bitcoin as a threat.  And crypto *is* a threat.  A huge threat to an established regime of control and power.  
As we saw with the TARP bailout our financial system is manipulated as needed to keep the established power structure intact.  Wouldn't it have been great if the financial sector's losses were not socialized and their profits kept private?  But their losses were socialized.  And they will be again.  This is the order of things.
Crypto could upset the balance of power in the world.  Therefore the old fuckers must destroy it, if they can.  So don't be shocked or put off when they come with regulation and legislation in order to try to end it.  
Technology has already upset the balance of a few other industries in such fundamental ways that the Warren Buffets of the world have to take this seriously.  One example of this is Amazon.  We have legacy brands that are dying out. Sears, JC Penney's, Macy's, even Walmart is feeling the sting.   Another industry is the automobile/power generation sector.  If Tesla can pull off its transformation of the power grid and auto industry then there could be a major upheaval.  In the same way that shopping malls are dying out quickly we could have power plants going offline permanently with barely even a passing glance from John Q. Public.
My favorite example of technology killing a legacy industry is Kodak and other film cameras.  Film used to be ubiquitous. Now it is utterly gone.  No more film production. No more film processing. No more film cameras and very very few digital cameras being sold.  I grew up around film cameras.  My family had a 35mm, a Super 8mm, and several 110 cameras.  We had flash bulbs. We had a Polaroid. Every household had several film cameras and rolls and rolls of film taken, processed and placed into photo albums every year.  But now there is nothing left of it. Kodak is just as gone from our culture as the rotary dial telephone. 
This is what strikes fear into the spirits of the power brokers.  They don't want change. They don't want to be on the losing side of history.  Something as simple as the creative use of prime factorization, if left to its own, could make the government money just as irrelevant as the flash cube.  If that happens then the Federal Reserve loses it's influence and their control of the financial system will be lost.  
So in my mind, if crypto currency is allowed to continue to blossom then there is no other outcome but a loss of power for the Federal Reserve. They WILL stop cryptocurrency IF they can.

The supply of national currency(dollars, etc)  will continue to grow while the supply of BC(potentially), won't grow. Questions that come to mind, could bitcoin ever be a reserve currency with such a small number in existence? Since bitcoin can be lost or destroyed with no new ones being made, what is the terminal limit for BC (how long until there are so few of them that they can no longer be used as a liquid currency)? Since BC do not exist outside mathematics, unlike the Mona Lisa, at what point in the total number of BC do they lose value, mathematically, since there won't be enough for trading? 
@_date: 2016-06-19 01:11:07
Thanks 
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:18:56
This is a better answer to my question.  I've purchased as much BC as I can.  I'd just like to take advantage of this latest upswing.

Coinbase is fine is you are a legal adult with a bank account that is friendly to Coinbase. Bank of America is good, Chase seems to have problem sometimes. Coinbase has an onerous verification process and if it is not completed correctly then you might not be able to transfer or withdraw.
Doesn't the Cash app still allow you to purchase BTC?

Forbes should be embarrassed to publish this kind of unsupported drivel. I'm not going to begin to list all the ways that bitcoin investing is different than real estate investing.

No one with any sense is trying to convince the general public that Bitcoin is a swell 'investment'.  It is useful for certain people. 
The larger concept of the block chain and open ledger accounting does have implications for individuals in need of retail banking.  If you are interested in seeing retail banking continue without disruption then I guess block chain is a bad thing. if you are interested in seeing the retail banking industry (for individuals, not businesses) changed in a fundamental way then black chain and open ledger accounting is quite exciting.
