I cant see any reason why I would choose citicoin over bitcoin. If citicoin is to be regulated and governed by citigroup, what's new? There doesnt seem to be any advantage to using citicoin. Then again im a novice with cloud currency

I'm a newbie to all this and downloaded bitcoin core a few weeks back. It's only finished downloading the blockchain, if I was to update to this new version would I have to download all that again? I'm guessing no, but just wanted to check

The US wouldn't even have existed if it wasn't for the europeans either would it? Are we supposed to blindly back the US cause of the whole hitler thing? Think not
