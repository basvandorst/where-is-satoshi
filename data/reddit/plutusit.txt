Pluton is a digital asset, similar to Bitcoin or Ether and a transferable fungible with a unique use case, it can be exchanged with other users in return for contactless balance on the app, instantly at zero fee (Bitcoin and Ether will have a fee). Their value is determined by traders on the PlutusDEX and externally.

We were at the initial proof of concept stage of the Plutus tap and pay app when we held our previous AMA here. We have come a long way since then by improving on the inner workings of the app, and our decentralised exchange. After releasing the [White Paper]( we have seen overwhelming support with new members joining the team and a high volume of sign-ups to support Plutus.it. 
Although Bitcoin itself is the most ideal payment system, we wanted to facilitate the use of Bitcoin for everyday purchases, a practical use case that has been held back by merchant adoption since it’s inception. Plutus solves this by connecting into the fiat payment system. This means that you can send Bitcoin to your Plutus account, and pay with the mobile app at any existing contactless terminal. (In the future, online payments will be available as well.)
But Plutus isn’t just another NFC or a payments app. Plutus Tap &amp; Pay is fueled by the backbone of the system: the [PlutusDEX]( This platform facilitates the conversion of users Bitcoin deposits to fiat in a peer-to-peer manner,  issuing an automatic 3% rebate to users denominated in an Ethereum asset called **[Pluton]( (which you can get early to be used to make instant payments without conversion fees). 
Our solution creates a practical bridge between Bitcoin / Ethereum and the virtual debit card system, which means that you don’t have to wait for brick &amp; mortar merchants to accept bitcoin. Simply go to the point of sale, and hold your phone over the NFC reader!
We plan to launch later this year, but our top priority is security. There will be formal security audits of the PlutusDEX and it’s smart contracts before we launch.

Crypto deposits are sent to another user registered on the PlutusDEX, this user has fiat secured in escrow, which is then released to the VDC on the app once blockchain confirmation is received. We are currently banking in the UK.

The PlutusDEX does not hold any user funds and simply supervises over transactions made on the blockchain, however, there will still be formal security audits of it’s smart contracts before we launch.

No, they are two separate payment options on the Plutus app.

You can deposit BTC and convert to fiat on the app as well as have an alternative option to convert ETH to fiat to make contactless payments. Both payment options have their own market place for exchange. You can see the complete process for Bitcoin transactions with commentary in this [video](

Its a decentralised reward system (a smart contract) that emits Pluton to the user's wallet for every conversion that is recorded on the PlutusDEX.

The power of the Plutus app is that you can simply download the app, make a deposit with Bitcoin, and tap and pay, without waiting for a debit card in the post. 
Pluton is a decentralised rebate system that simply emits 3% or less tokens to the user who makes Bitcoin or Ether conversion on the app.
A user can then convert these tokens instantly and for free to a fiat value, which is transferred to a virtual debit card to make contactless payments.
There will be a very low amount in initial circulation, as well as extremely low emission rate. This is an intentional by design because Plutons are in our opinion the first alternative crypto asset that has a real life use case and because the are free to use on the system they are intentionally designed to be rare.
KYC is standard, name address, email, ID scan.

Yes, with the [PlutusDEX]( you can reigster as trader to buy Bitcoin, Ether and Pluton directly from other users who send a deposit for conversions on the Plutus app. The DEX will be a market place to fuel the payment system, and it will also come equipped with an open source API, which will enable other users as well as exchanges to plug in to DEX.

850,000 Plutons.

There will be standard KYC checks throughout the platform, similar to an exchange.
Only conversions made from crypto to fiat are on the blockchain. Payments made at merchants are recorded internally.
