Really?  You are a lawyer?  Then why did you over here say you were an information security professional?


Something seems a bit fishy about you.  From your post history you make it sound like you were an officer in the Army, have your law degree, worked as a prosecutor, worked for years at some big firms before starting your own practice where you charge $400+ an hour (for reference the average in the entire US is 200-400 an hour so you claim to charge above average lawyer fees), are also in information security, and are only 29 years old. 
I'm calling bullshit on you. 
Edit:  To backup my statements and some others to point out your multiple claims:












So you were an officer in the army who has a law degree, worked as a prosecutor, worked on the hill, own your own practice, charge above the nation average for lawyers, are an IT security auditor, and you are only 29.

If the guy was older then 29 I could see it but serving as an officer in the military, getting an advance degree that normally takes 3+ year (so 7+ years of college), working as a prosecutor, working on the hill, and working at a large firm till the point of being able to quit and charge above the national average all before hitting 29?  Just not seeing it.
