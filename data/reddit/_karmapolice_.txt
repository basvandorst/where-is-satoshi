Hahaha sarcasm is lost on you isn't it?

I understand you're American so you may not know this, but just because you think something is true, doesn't make it necessarily the case...
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:06:17
This is a joke right? You couldn't possibly honestly think this? The American education system is ordinary... but surely not this bad...
If you're not joking you should try using that Google you speak of to search "the British Empire".

Funny how Americans think that their bastardised form of the english language is more correct than that from actual England.
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:32:49
The rest of the world speaks English? 
I suppose the only two languages most Americans are aware of is English and Mexican.

Exactly how recently did you buy Bitcoins? I can guarantee you the Euro will not fall 75% in the space of a year... unlike some other cryptocurrencies I can think of....

So the only people that should be using Bitcoin are people with a high level of understanding of computer security and encryption measures? Otherwise you could potentially lose all your money and be called a fool by some dickhead on the Internet?
I'm sure that will promote widespread adoption of the currency.

Wait a bit longer and you'll be able to afford a lot more than just 1..

Do yourself a favour and get out while you're ONLY 4k down..

... you should probably rethink your investment allocation?
@_date: 2019-12-31 22:25:57
One of the primary determinants of whether a currency is good is stability... a 400% variance in value within 1 year is not just "mediocre"..

You guys need to make up your minds... is Bitcoin a currency or an investment? Based on that graph, it's either a great investment, or a really shitty currency.
@_date: 2019-12-31 23:53:16
Yes, because when I can't afford my rent next month because Bitcoin declined 25%, I'll be happy in the knowledge that I still have 1/21,000,000th of the total

"The enemy"... common sense?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:11:16
As likely as you not having any friends.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:25:55
Never go full Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:28:52
Why though? Like are they expecting someone to see it and realise "hey Bitcoin is better!". Because that won't happen. All it will do is make people think some sad loser has nothing better to do with their time.  And they'd be right.

You're comfortable with a 70%+ drop in price? Fools and their money...
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:51:39
You obviously don't belieeeeve in the bitcoin mannn... You need to blindly throw yourself in with blatant disregard, ignoring common sense and evidence to the contrary.. What's what belief (in any respect) is all about!
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:56:42
Only used "inflated" to align with the OP. Saying the value of goods purchased with Bitcoin is currently subject to 98% daily deflation is better?
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:58:18
Bitcoin has inflated by 98% in the last day... how on earth would this be a better option?
