There is no argument.  Just people telling their stories of who they are and what they have done and want to do.  That's how we learn about reality.
Whether someone has a mental difference or not, they still have valuable stories to share.  But this human seems to be the opposite of "retarded" and is excited about learning programming and making useful stuff with it.  Which is cool.

Who ever said investments were supposed to pay off immediately?
As long as you still have the same amount you got initially, you still have what you have.  And it still has more potential to do good things for the world than any $ in a corporate/government bank.

Or, better, buy Bitcoin, spend it (or give it away) and then immediately replace it (with the fiat that you would be spending anyway).  That way it gets used and more people have it, so it's more popular.  And you don't lose any.

This is the best way to run an organization.  It means that nearly always people are doing the work because they actually want it done, and/or love doing it.  It's internal motivation, like with anything you love to do in life.

This was fairly repetitive but this stuck out as being something you don't see too often:




The future government is one that functions as a bottom-up, emergent, collaborative organism, just like our animal bodies.  There is no score-keeping game like money, just the free flow of resources from where they are produced (excess outputs) to where they are used (needed inputs, or at least recyclable ones).  Each individual is free to do whatever kind of work they naturally love to do - what they were born to do.
I see Bitcoin as two things:
1. Helping with the transition from that top-down/centralized government to a more fully decentralized one (but still trying to use the competitive score-keeping approach).
2. Setting up an infrastructure for us to create a global database for keeping track of resources that people want to get rid of (offers) so that they can be redirected to where they are most useful (requests), most efficiently (freely).

If you go to a restaurant and eat a meal, is that also "debt" in your mind, since you haven't actually given them the money yet...
Banking cards/accounts are just the way we pay for things now.  We can't use cash on the internet, nor checks.  And because individual banks didn't want to get into the transaction processing business, they hired Visa and Mastercard and other companies to do that for them.  So almost all transactions now go through those to companies.

Bitcoin IS used as a currency.  But it's not for petty exchanges.  In fact, no currency is really good for petty exchanges.  Those are better off being free.  It's a waste of everyone's resources to keep track of a few dollars here and there and everywhere.  It just goes around and around in circles.  Eliminate the score keeping from small stuff, and save the time and energy and human power for more important things, like finding efficient ways to meet everyone's basic needs so that we're not desperate enough to do shitty, anti-social things like conning people into buying and using crap that makes life worse.

The graph isn't at all nonsensical.  I understand it fully.  Your $1.00 that you had in the 30's would now only buy you the equivalent of what 5¢ would buy you then.  So saving $ would be a very, very bad idea.  Compared to saving (hodling!) Bitcoin.
And the gun is more reasonable a comparison than a computer, since guns have somewhat reasonably stable supply and demand values.

You're ignoring what a "system" is.  A centralized system can be opt in or not.  A decentralized system can be opt in or not.  Those things are irrelevant to whether or not a system is governed in a centralized way.
Centralized means top-down decision making where some individual or group decides the rules for everyone.  Decentralized means that every individual decides only the rules that they follow, and the overall behavior of the system is bottom-up, emergent.
The amoeba is a good example of a decentralized system, where there is no part of the amoeba telling any other part what to do, and instead does what it wants to do (based on goals like finding food), and the behavior of the whole amoeba is the product (not the sum) of all of the parts.  If one part smells food to it's north and signals the cilia to push the system north, and another part of the amoeba smells food to the west and signals the cilia to move west, then the amoeba as a whole will move in a third direction, north-west.  There is no centralized part telling the amoeba to move north-west, it just does, because that's the overall movement of the system as a whole.  This is decentralization.
This is very different from a car being driven by a computer or human, who controls almost everything about the movement of the car.  A human or computer driving a car is a centralized system.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:35:06
A small group of individuals making decisions (based on even smaller interactions) for everyone else.  That's a centralized system.  
A decentralized system is when every individual makes their own decisions, for themselves, and governance emerges from the bottom up, with changes being made naturally as different individuals choose to go in similar directions because those directions work well for them.  Like how an amoeba works, with parts of it following the chemical scent of food and the rest of the parts following along because they want food too.

Nope.  And even if I did, my choices would be over-ruled, if the downvotes I've gotten in this discussion are any indication.  Some majority rule wouldn't like what I liked, and it would be a waste of everyone's time for me to bother proposing them.
Also, coding is a very small specialized interest/niche, so if you are demanding it of those who want to participate in the decision-making process it means that those who have other interests that are valuable and important to the world would either need to stop doing that important work, or they would be left out.

A credit card is different from "using credit".  Credit cards are how nearly all transactions are done when exchanging money these days.  Almost no one uses checks anymore, and those don't even work on the internet really.  I believe all regular checking and savings account bank cards are either Visa or Mastercard in the US.
And remember, even when using credit on a card, the companies carefully assign your credit limits based on how much they think you are capable of paying off.  Poor people have very low limits, if the credit card companies are doing their jobs.
Having said that, for me, having money in a national currency was far more of a gamble than having it in Bitcoin.  Now, as a homeless woman, I have the ability to buy some property to start a non-profit community space that will freely house many humans who will do volunteer community service to improve the world.  There's no way I could have done that if the donation had been in a national currency, as the value would have gone down by now, rather than shooting way up.

Here: 
(note: it's mostly the past, so if you just want to read the part about the big project I'm going to be using Bitcoin to fund, skip to the last section of the book called futuruum I think)
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:57:10
For starters, Bitcoin's inherent nature of the value being a constant fraction of a whole, as opposed to being a constant number in a perpetually increasing whole like with $ (where banks are regularly generating more $ by issuing credit), make it better than banking currencies, when it comes to monetary investments.  (That's the inflation vs deflation thing that the graph was trying to show, where the value of the same amount goes down or up over time, in relation to the whole.  1 BTC will always be the same fraction of all BTC available, while there are always more $'s added to the pool of $'s, so $1 is never the same fraction of all $'s available.)
And then we look at the robustness of the system itself, based on the goals of a value/score keeping system.  It's better than anything else so far, at least as far as most unbiased people in cryptocurrencies seem to think.  Not that there aren't other ones that might be better, but Bitcoin is definitely up there.
And we look at the fact that it all just comes down to popularity, timing, and hookiness.  The general public likes Bitcoin.  It's just a hip thing.  To the point where advertisers and PR departments are starting to fall over themselves looking to cash in on the popularity of the meme (if not Bitcoin itself).
Plus, it's a global, dispersed, currency, so even if one country or even 10 dumps it entirely, there are still billions of humans who will potentially want in on it.
And, finally, the fact that there are at least a handful of seriously influential individuals and groups who have a huge interest in Bitcoin being huge, means that there will continue be a lot of powerful attempts (as there already have been) to manipulate things towards Bitcoin being more and more desirable.
All that adds up to Bitcoin's value/price probably going much, much higher in the next few years, or as long as the whole meme of money being useful (which is likely to go extinct very soon).
The only real challenges to that prediction are the lack of a simple interface for exchanging things for Bitcoin for the general public, and the fickleness of hipsters.

Bitcoin isn't really anonymous.  No moreso than cash anyway.  There are social engineering ways to trace the flow no matter what symbolic score keeping system you want to use.
Making the large scale exchanges more regulated just means that it will be more valuable in the large scale because more mainstream types will be willing to take the risk and buy in.  Others will still have options for more obfuscated ways of trading outside of mainstream banks and exchanges.
Diversity in a system is always healthy and this adds options, so it's good.

Your logic contradicts itself.  If you go to a restaurant and eat before you pay, then you owe the restaurant.  That's a debt.  Regardless of how you pay in the end.  Or even IF you pay...
And my example is exactly the topic, which is you claiming that debt is bad.  But it's normal and how we do business when it comes to buying things much of the time.  The exchange of the money is rarely at the exact same time as the exchange of product or service being traded.  We might pay before we get the thing.  We might pay after we get the thing.  We might never pay and still get the thing.  How long the time between getting things and paying for them, or whether someone gets paid at all, ends up being is a large variable based on the whole system of currencies and products/services.  It's all really just a big chaotic fluid dynamical system with stuff of all manner flitting about and being redirected.  Sort of like a river with lots of rapids and rocks and waterfalls and such.  And, for the most part, the currencies and their arbitrary numbers are mostly useless in the grand scheme of life.  It's the material and informational resources themselves that are important to us.  As long as they keep flowing from where they are overabundant/unwanted to where they are underabundant/needed/useful, it's all good.  We could ignore the numbers and the flow of resources would probably be totally functional, if not better, for the system as a whole.

On a more serious side, my own favorite theory is that there is a multiverse, with every single possible pattern of matter and energy (contraction and expansion) covered, using a simple pattern that we see in [Pascal's triangle].  Which creates pure mathematical randomness out of a deterministic process.  We are only ever aware of one timeline at a time (one ball falling through the [quincunx]( so each moment is essentially a unique universe (an observer collapsing the quantum wave function), but that single time line is fully connected to past universes, and will intersect with other parallel universes as well in the future.  Like how a particle flowing through a river travels with it's neighbors, splits up, and then sometimes reconnects with neighbors, having taken different paths.  
Ultimately, all possible paths are taken.  With no missing "holes", and with an infinitely fractioning of reality.
I think that what this person is saying is at least reasonably similar to what this theory talks about.  Though without any diagrams of the chains and stories, I'm not quite sure what they mean.
But it's definitely interesting.  Thanks!

Even determined little kids will eventually give up playing a Monopoly game when they realize that they could go make a treehouse, or go play in ocean waves, or learn a new language, or write a new song, or read about their friend's vacation..."

I wish someone had gotten to me way earlier to nudge me away from worshipping corporations and money as I'd been brainwashed to do as a child.  I wish it hadn't taken until my late 20's to hear some really strong voices about how insane the pursuit of money makes us.  I did hear other non-mainstream voices when I was a teenager, and those helped shape me into a far healthier and more respectful and aware woman I am today.

Who knows where I first heard about Bitcoin.  Probably on Reddit, and This Week In Tech podcast.  Probably sometime in 2013 or 14?  I took folks (on this community I think) up on the offer to get some free BTC using the changetipbot thing.  I got a couple of US dollars worth (at the time) donated to me there.  I also set up my own wallet at some point in 2014 and put my address up on my blog/podcast as a way to get donations.  I got an anonymous donation there at some point, too, of a few bucks.  Then in 2016 I got some funding for a non-profit I've been trying to start, and I've been putting that into Bitcoin starting in October of 2016, when it was just starting to really go up.  I first got in at about $728.  I've been putting donations into BTC ever since, mostly at around $1000.
I also had used the free Stellar Lumens offer I found on Reddit back when they were first starting up.  I recently heard rumblings about it going up and discovered that it had indeed hit the moon.  The $10 worth that they'd given away was worth almost $5000.  I kept some, and traded most of it for BTC to keep my fund growing.
My long term goal, as a woman who's been homeless off and on for over a decade now, is to buy some very cheap property and start a small collaborative non-profit space where artists, geeks, and educators would live for free in exchange for doing creative problem-solving for the local community.

This is the map of the future:  (read bottom-up)
And while money isn't part of it, since everyone will be free and collaborating, the blockchain structure will be extremely useful at the logistics level of keeping track of freely available resources so that people can match their excess materials to those who can use them, and transportation/shipping can be arranged in an effective, efficient way.
Also, the whole immaterial and irrational aspect of money (keeping quantitative score) will become very, very obvious when it's literally all arbitrary numbers on some screen, in some arbitrary currency platform.  Just like Reddit karma.  It's mostly meaningless, but at most can be amusing to toss an upvote to someone for offering something useful to you.  Which is sort of like what you're talking about now.  We just need to disconnect it from people getting their physical needs met, since we NEED people to be healthy, not deficient/sick, physically (which leads to mental illness as well).

Most people in the US don't even know what actually gets shut down.
But generally it means that many non-military government employees won't get paid (at least not yet) and US government offices and such may be closed.  Normally the employees do end up getting paid eventually, though.  And a lot of stuff still works fine.  But, you never know.  The stuff that gets closed or has a lot of staff not working is the stuff that is sort of long term research and problem solving stuff, like helping people with their taxes.
Last time this happened the national parks were closed.  But it looks like Veterans were outraged about this so this time around that won't be the case.

I finally gave up and resubmitted the card and selfie and all, and it was approved almost immediately and worked fine.
And in the time it took to work, the bottom dropped out of Bitcoin, and I got it super cheap.  So that worked out well.

Well, yes, that's because most people are actually intelligent and know that the whole competitive Monopoly game is insane and harmful to ourselves, as it makes us treat our fellow collaborators as "enemies", which only makes life worse, for everyone.

You realize that the whole point of taxes is to have those who have too much (more than most) pay back the system as a whole, so that things are more balanced.
I'm not saying that it's a good tactic.  But if you are making more than a comfortable amount, then it makes sense in this system for you to pay more taxes, and for trying to make more than that to be disincentivized.  $37,000 a year is more than enough for one human living a comfortable life.

Greed is actually exceedingly weak.  It's something that has to be taught and regularly rewarded for it to survive since the natural state of humans and other social animals is one of wanting to be loved and wanted as we are, and to be free to be ourselves, rather than being feared and in constant battle just to survive.
But that's sort of beside the point.  We will build, run, and share the things we need, directly.  Without doing it for some corporation or government and then having them sell it back to us for a profit.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:33:36

I think that it just might be the US government getting involved.  Snooping around the exchanges.  Looking for anyone and everyone dealing with cryptocurrencies.

It requires *decentralized* coordination, the way your own body's cells work to make global nervous and circulatory systems.

@_date: 2018-01-14 21:57:50
Right, it's all decentralized in your body.  There is no central cell telling others what they can and can't do.  There is simply resources and information being sent around from one cell to another.
That is the model we will be using (consciously or not, since this is evolution in action here) to build a healthy global system.  
And it's not likely that it will be cables.  Those are sort of the dinosaurs of technology these days.  Electromagnetic waves are where information can really flow globally.

My bank card is a credit card.  
Also, the credit cards I use other than my checking account card offer promotional credits that give me money for using them.  And I get charged no interest.  I'm using my money to pay for the crypto even if I use my non-checking account, since I'm paying the credit card bill from my checking account.  It's always my money.  Unless I choose to not pay a credit card bill.

@_date: 2018-01-29 21:57:49
Also, taking this as a philosophical experiment, it doesn't matter how many Bitcoins exist, what matters is what percentage you have of them.  Even if 99% of the BTC is in unrecoverable accounts, we still can function with 1% as the whole amount that is available right now.  It's still all about supply and demand.  We can divide 100% into infinitely small allotments if we want.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:07:46
Looking closely at how we tend to do things in Bitcoinland:
The pattern is: hit a new power of 10 (going a bit above it), for a new peak, then drop to somewhere above the previous power of 10, then hit the higher power of 10 for the second time, and then peak pretty quickly to the next power of 10 for a new all time high.
So, we had 
First ATH: $10  
New low: $3
Second ATH: $100  
New low: $25
Third ATH: $1000   
New low: $400
Fourth ATH: $10,000  
New Low: $3000
Next will likely be:
Fifth ATH: $100,000  
New low: $30,000

What is most risky is keeping national currencies in a mainstream bank, where they have no chance to make the world a better place.

How about making a simple "How to use Bisq" written for normal humans?  We don't care about how you are improving the software or whatever, we just want to know which selection to choose when setting things up so that we can actually buy some Bitcoin.
When someone who's fairly familiar with Bitcoin and using exchanges tries to use it and gives up after 5 minutes because there are no explanations of which of the many options to use, and what the steps are, then you're not going to get a lot of new folks joining the party.

Statistically, he or she is better off with the bitcoin, since without it, if they lose their job and the economy tanks, they're screwed.
But at least with the Bitcoin, if they lose their job, and the mainstream economy tanks but is still alive enough for the bank to continue wanting money from them, then they have money that's most likely far more valuable than what the banks are dealing in.  (Since Bitcoin is sort of in inverse proportion to mainstream money value.)

Actually centralized government can't define a decentralized system, and it's a fools errant to try to force it to.
A decentralized system is bottom-up, not top-down.  It is self-regulating.  Those who chose to participate in it are the ones who decide how it works.  Decentralized is DIY.  It's time we stop looking to mommy and daddy government and corporations to provide the things we want/need, and do it ourselves, for ourselves.

I consider entropy to be the universal law of physics, which is the process of dividing simple things up and recombining them in novel ways, forming new, more complex things.  This is also what evolution is.  (I got the original idea from physicist Lee Smolin.)
This process creates more complexity, which is collaboration between diverse things, again, whether we're talking about atoms, cells, or living organisms.  Or planets.  Like the one that the Earth is becoming.  A living system, connected and starting to operate as a single organism, but on a higher scale, where we're starting to have a centralized nervous and circulatory system, and becoming aware of how we're all dependent on one another's health and well-being.  As Buckminster Fuller spoke of.
The new politics will be this healthy collaborative form, that emerges spontaneously, rather than being forced in some kind of authoritarian system like we have now.  This healthy, decentralized, chaotic system will allow us all to be free to follow our dreams and get what we need, from the system as a whole, to do that as effectively as possible.

That has nothing to do with whether something is centralized.  You can have a democratically voted central government and you can have one that was seized by whomever had the most power (resources).  They are still centralized.

Just fyi, logically, if something is secure, it's centralized.  Decentralized systems are chaotic/unpredictable.  Bitcoin is heavily centralized as a system, it's just got a different kind of process for "choosing" the individuals who get to participate in making the rules than national currencies.  Bitcoin allows anyone with money/resources to govern it, as equal votes, whereas with the US currency, for example, there are higherarchies of control, from voting citizens electing representatives, who vote to elect individuals and corporations who make the rules, based on their own personal goals/opinions.

Actually, it takes years and years of bad parenting and education to make humans idiots.  Human brains are born naturally curious and capable of great intellectual feats.

If you're not free to make up your own rules and still be a full part of the system, then its centralized: you follow the rules, or get kicked out of the system.  If you try to double spend in Bitcoin, for example, you'll have your transaction rejected.
That's why Bitcoin is so stable and secure, because the ledger and rules are heavily controlled, and rigid, and not easy to fuck with.
In a decentralized system, anyone can do whatever they want, which is what currencies are as a whole.  You can make whatever fork of Bitcoin you want, freely, and you're still a part of the system that is "currencies".

The mainstream economy tanking is caused by unpredictable politics in national governments and their greedy corporate puppetmasters.
Bitcoin is governed by a bunch of geeks across the planet with a shared goal of keeping a very stable system of accounting.  The value of that system is indeed variable, but the more risky mainstream money gets, the less risky Bitcoin will look, at least for most folks.

There are two important kinds of highs and lows.
All time high (ATH) highs are when its exchange value for US$ is higher than it's ever been before.
The lowest dip, or new low, between two all time highs are the new baseline which it won't get below again (probably).
We can't know what the second one is until the new all time high happens.  But we can at least make a reasonable guess that it will be higher than the all time high before the most recent one, as long as things are still growing, and adoption hasn't reached its peak yet.
For example:
ATH 1: 10  
New low 1: 3  
ATH 2: 100  
New low 2: 25  
ATH 3: 1000  
New low 3: 400  
ATH 4: 10,000  
New Low 4: 3000  
ATH 5: 100,000  
New low 5: 50,000
So, if you are higher than it's ever been before, it's a good time to sell (or spend or hodl, if you want).  If it's going down from a freshly minted all time high, especially if it's significantly below it, then it's a good time to buy.

 has stores and such where you can buy Bitcoin with cash or debit cards in many cities in the US.  Their fees are probably higher than some other places, but it's convenient for low to medium amounts.  You just place a request online and then go pick it up in person.
Under $200 you don't even need an ID or anything, just a phone number, I believe.
I like them because they were started by someone from MIT, back when MIT students all got Bitcoin as a promotional thing, so I feel they are a bit more reliable and legit.

Not my site.
And log scale is how growth is measured in normal systems.  Real life isn't linear.  Things grow fast, and only later, when they are mature do they plateau and then decline.
And I did try to get the person who designed that site to fix the percentage to be logarithmic.  If you look at the chart itself, you can see that we're very close to where the prediction is.  Though I think that prediction is a bit inflated, but with variation we'll get well above the line soon, again.  Remember the line is an average, not a prediction in and of itself.  Huge, somewhat random, variation around the line is the prediction.
If you look at the pattern, as I described it, you'll see it's holding perfectly to it.  Humans, at least modern ones, have a predilection for powers of 10.  So even if we're doing it subconsciously, we're excited about adding a 0 as soon as we can.  And there are only a few folks in the game who are trying to subtract zeros from Bitcoin.  So overall the movement is exponential.

Free agent homes would be totally cool.  I bet someday that will be an option.  And not just in space. :-)
But for now, what other option is there for having a reliable home?  Renting is way worse since you not only have to pay for maintenance but also have to line someone else's pockets with profits.  Living with your parents, when they own their own home, is the only other option, which is fine, if you get along with them.  But that's rare...

I think the rifle is more meaningful, since A: agriculture is subsidized and B: you need to look at things that cost significantly MORE than an hour's pay.  Otherwise things are too close to really see a difference.  Like measuring your weight today and tomorrow to see if your diet is working, compared with measuring your weight over a year or more.
I think a house (of the same size and general livability) is really a great single item to compare.  Or just the overall living expenses.
But really the point of this graph is to show you how saving $ is a bad idea.  Saving BTC, so far, is a fantastic idea.  Because $ is inflationary and BTC is deflationary.
Though a house is probably the best thing to save, really.

I think it is the direction evolution (entropy) always moves towards, with more randomness, freedom, diversity, complexity, fitness, and collaboration being the norm in a system, as natural selection and random mutation are allowed to happen.
First it happened with life itself emerging from different atoms collaborating (forming proteins).  Then cells formed out of different proteins collaborating.  Then organisms formed out of different cells collaborating.  And now planets are forming out of different organisms collaborating.

I should clarify, Bitcoin's central rules are governed by meritocracy *plus* money/resources.  You need money to mine Bitcoin, usually.
The developers don't necessarily have to have money.  They can program the code without ever having any Bitcoin at all, I believe.  But the miners and node runners, who get to vote in the democratic process of updating the ledger, do need money (or free energy and computers) to participate in the governing process.

I think you're not at all aware of the expendable income of the demographic of Reddit, and even this Bitcoin community.
A large proportion of us don't have a job, either due to there not being enough jobs available for everyone, of because we're in school, or we have a part time job or occasional contract work, because that's what's mostly available.
Add to that the reality that housing is extremely competitive, due to a lack of supply, which means that housing takes almost all of our income, if we do have it.
Leaving us, even in wealthy areas, with almost no extra income to play with, after paying for our housing, food, transportation, and smaller basic needs.

To me freedom comes from being aware that all thoughts are unique, and that no thoughts are "true" or "false".
Which is why I think it's great that you have your own thoughts that are different from mine, even when one of your thoughts is that others should only have the same thoughts as you do, and that your thoughts, alone, are the "true" thoughts of all of reality.

The all time highs are based on multiples of 10.  Yes, they will go a bit over, each time we hit that next higher exponent, but the real line is the mental addition of a 0 at the end of the exchange value.
The pattern is: hit a new power of 10 (going a bit above it), for a new peak, then drop to somewhere above the previous power of 10, then hit the higher power of 10 for the second time, and then peak pretty quickly to the next power of 10 for a new all time high.
So, we had 
First ATH: $10
New low: $3
Second ATH: $100
New low: $25
Third ATH: $1000
New low: $400
Fourth ATH: $10,000
New Low: $3000

Fifth ATH: $100,000

Life isn't a contest for me
It's an opportunity to share different viewpoints so that the universe can be seen in a larger, more multidimensional, view.
I'm trying to understand why you think a system with a very clear, obvious, intentional central set of rules is "decentralized".  And I'm pretty sure it mostly has to do with it being either distributed physically around the planet, and/or with the fact that participation is more directly democratic, and open to all who have the money/resources to do so, which is a little different from national currencies.
And I'm trying to help you see my perspective, which is one focused on logic and language and math, where there is a very specific meaning and function to a centralized system (linear), which is quite different from a chaotic, non-linear, decentralized system.

Why don't you try double spending Bitcoin, if you think you're free to make up your own rules, and don't have to follow the central ones.
Yes, outside of Bitcoin you can do whatever you want with the ledger and "Bitcoin", but you'll be booted out of Bitcoin, which is precisely why the woman in the video testimony is saying Bitcoin is secure.  Bitcoin absolutely can force you to follow the central rules.  If it wasn't able to do that, you could have an infinite amount of Bitcoin whenever you wanted to.
That's the power of extreme centralization: extreme control.
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:50:21
For clarity, centralization, in a system's theory definition doesn't require the central rules to be created by any specific number of individuals.  We don't care how the rules got there, just that they exist as central/shared rules.  As in the system that is a specific currency, like Bitcoin or US$.
Decentralized systems don't have shared rules.  All individuals have their own.  As in the system that is "all currencies".

It's a good thing because it means specialization, creating organs that serve different functions in the whole system, allowing the system to be more creative and effective compared to a monoculture system.
And remember, we're not talking about the individuals who are choosing to live together in a specific style, we're talking about the design of the neighborhoods that repress diversity.
The key is whether or not people are free to be themselves, to be unique, to be whomever they want to be.  In a repressive monoculture community where everyone's homes are forced to look the same, that's not freedom, that's repression.  And that makes people feel trapped.  Which is a harmful thing.

In this case it was fairly exclusive to politicians.  There are not many humans who actually love money.  But politicians are obsessed with it for the most part.  That's sort of all they focus on in their work, who has money, who "should" get it, and how to make more.
Most of humanity just wants to have enough to have a decent life and not spend all their time thinking about some grand Monopoly game.  It's just not that interesting a game, in the long run.

She is actually demonstrating why Bitcoin is centralized.  It's lasted and been tested and is resilient, and the ledger (the central authority) is secure and stable.  That's why it's so powerful.
It's just that Bitcoin is more meritocratically governed by individuals around the entire planet, as compared to national currencies, which can have more arbitrarily elected/appointed individuals making the decisions, which makes the central rules easier to manipulate.

Ok, think about what we have as the basic law of thermodynamics.  We can't create, nor destroy, matter and energy.  And we know that there are two kinds of forces, at all levels of matter and energy: repulsion and attraction.
So, if we start with a stable system, where everything is nicely uniform, and resting, what happens when we apply time (entropy)?  Will it all just sit still, with no energy changing things?  Or will entropy increase and everything starts "falling apart"?


YOU were the one who said it was like utopia.  Not me.  I said it's just normal healthy biology.  Communism is the government structure that all healthy systems use, including your body.  It's a free, decentralized system, where everyone gets to do what they want, and gets what they need to do it as well as possible, for free, as much as possible.  No centralized authority or laws that everyone must follow, or be rejected, and no coercion or restricting resources or individuals, based on some central ideal, the way money and democratic and totalitarian governments work.

Please do consider giving to the smaller, more volunteer run projects, since they tend to do the most good with the least funding, and have the hardest time getting attention.
Also, look for projects that focus on understanding the problem from the perspective of those who are having it, rather than coming in with a preset one-size-fits-all solution that might be mostly a waste of resources.
As someone who's worked in both government and non-profits and education for most of her life, I have seen way too many projects waste nearly all of their resources and end up with almost nothing to show for it, mostly because they didn't pay attention to what was causing the problem and what solutions were actually working in the field, as opposed to in the labs and books.

Actually Bitcoin is very much a zero sum game.  All currencies are, since in order to get 1 BTC someone else has to give up 1 BTC.  The whole point of the ledger is to make sure that there are no positive sums.
Positive sum games don't use numbers to measure value, so that more than one individual can gain at the same time, while no one loses.

If we're talking about a fairly small amount of profit, which you're probably talking about if you're using these aggregation sites for spending Bitcoin on things like t-shirts and pizza and maybe a new computer, tops, then that would likely fall into the "not worth keeping track of' in the same way that most folks don't keep receipts for everything and itemize deductions.
I bought a fidget spinner for about $18's worth of Bitcoin many years ago, and the profit I made there might, at most, have been $10.

If Bitcoin had no central ledger, or software/code that governs how Bitcoin is allocated and generated, then it would have no security, and would be worthless to most folks who care about their money being safely stored.
If it's safe, it's centralized, because that central control means that it can't easily be changed.
If everyone is free to change things however they want, with no central control governing it, then things are chaotic and unstable.
If you can make your own Bitcoin whenever you want, and do whatever you want with it, with no one else's permission, then it would be decentralized.  But that goes against everything Bitcoin stands for, which is stability and unhackability of the ledger and core rules.


Exactly.  If someone else needs others' permission to change the rules, then the rules are centralized.
I still have a hard time understanding how this isn't obvious.  Or maybe it is, and folks are just trolling.  But you seem sincere.  So I really don't know how else to explain it.  So I mostly just repeat what I've said, and hope that those who do understand can explain it better.

You just described a centralized system.  Bitcoin is stable and solid and reliable *because* it is centralized, and everyone has to obey the same, agreed upon, rules.
A decentralized system would be one where everyone uses their own rules.  Currencies in general are a decentralized system, but individual ones are nearly always centralized.
The term you're thinking of is democratic, as opposed to a totalitarian sort of system, or at least a representative democracy, as in the US government's money, which has to go through elections to appoint folks who decide how the rules are made for money (in this case outsourcing to the Fed).

Bitcoin, like all other competitive point scoring games, is backed by a centralized system of rules for generating and allocating those points, based on some kind of valuation.
With Bitcoin that value is a combination of meritocracy and luck.  Those who happen to have the intellectual resources needed to mine or buy Bitcoin, and are lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time with the right equipment, get some.
Ultimately, though, Bitcoin is the alpha testing for a truly useful, positive sum, collaborative, game that promotes decentralized organization of resources, using a central architecture for keeping track of where resources are, and then letting anyone who wants to add and subtract resources from the system do so.  This will allow us individuals to offer and request resources when we need to, and the system will be able to match our needs with others' needs, so we can move things from where they are unwanted to where someone wants them.

There is another element that you're talking about, which is inflation.  Bitcoin could just as easily be inflationary.  It's not, but that has nothing to do with the structure of how it grows in use.
Compare the way bitcoin and bank currency's use structure to something more utilitarian, say, growing food.  Mainstream currencies were created by a small group of individuals (or maybe one, even) and then they slowly spread out into the world, with those who kept the most at the beginning being the ones to gain the most profit from trading them.  Growing food, on the other hand, is something that pretty much everyone can do, independently, and in parallel, all across the planet.  This structure is more like a square, rather than a top-down (centralized) pyramid.
(Though technically, if you literally had $1 a century ago, even in pennies, and kept them in a sealed environment, they would be worth quite a lot.  I've sold pretty well used pennies from the turn of last century and they were worth well into the $10 range. )

Um, the banking system.  Interest is a part of it for the banking system, of course.  But even if it weren't, you can easily have more value than everyone else if you hold on to most of it. 
Try this thought experiment with inflation, a pyramid scheme, and no interest: 
Say a bank prints out 100 blorps.  Blorps are nothing important, but the bank says that they are the next big thing!  They manage to convince people to trade their $ or whatever for the blorps.  The bank ends up trading 50 blorps with 50 different individuals, and the banks keep 50 blorps.  The people who have the blorps now have a good reason to promote the use/value of blorps, and so they tell others about how blorps are the next big thing!  Now, there aren't many blorps in circulation, and more people want them.  So the bank prints up more blorps.  Let's say that they print 1000 blorps this time. They keep half of the new batch and trade the other half of them with more people for $ or whatever.  Heck they could even give them away if they really wanted.   Now there are 1100 blorps in circulation, and the bank has 600, and they are fully in demand now.  Everyone wants blorps!  The bank doesn't need to charge interest because they have most of the blorps, and the more blorps that go out there, the more people want them.  So they are very valuable.  As long as the bank doesn't print up enough for everyone, there will still be people wanting them and being willing to trade valuable things for them, and thus blorps keep being valuable, even if each individual blorp is worth less than it was at the beginning, because there are so many of them out there.  As long as there is a demand, and as long as the bank still has most of them (or even just a lot of them), the bank is still at the top of the pyramid.

The fees are from the middleman exchanges, not normal Bitcoin transfers.
If you don't want to pay an exchange rate, then try doing what Bitcoin was made to do, be a transfer of money from peer to peer, directly.  Find someone you already know, in a community you're in, who wants to sell Bitcoin, and buy it directly from them.  No fees at all, except the very small miners' fee.  Which you can keep very low by not trading when volume is high.

All currencies are ponzi schemes.  That's how they work, since they are inherently valueless symbols of arbitrary "value".
What we want with Bitcoin becoming mainstream is, I believe, two things:
1. a more random redistribution of monetary wealth, the haves and the have nots switching places in many cases.  A homeless woman can buy a house.  A mansion owner loses their yacht.  Or something.  Not everyone making $ or whatever off of Bitcoin investments is poor, but many are, and many more are lower middle class.  While the big banks are losing value to their $, etc.  All this is demonstrating the irrationality of the zero-sum meme of "life as a competitive, Monopoly-style game" (as opposed to a collaborative, positive-sum game).
2. Testing out the functionality of the blockchain in a robust complex system, to sort out the problems before applying it to far more useful, rational, settings, such as keeping track of the matter and energy resources in a community, or on a spaceship, as they move around.

There are inflationary pyramid schemes and deflationary pyramid schemes.  We're talking about the structure of how it grows.

As opposed to a square where everyone creates the money and it just moves around fairly equally.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:04:19
It depends.
From my perspective, as far as I can tell, you are making gains only after you get back the original amount that you spent buying BTC.  For example, if you spent $1000 buying BTC and got a product or service that was valued at $100, then you haven't made any capital gains.  If you bought something valued at $2000, you made $1000 and would be responsible for tax on that gain.  I'm not sure if this is exactly how it works, but that's how I understand it.
And, also, remember both parts of this tactic, you are spending and replacing.  So if you use BTC to buy $100 thingie, and spend $100 buying BTC, then there is no gain at all.

Name one of those things?  Because there aren't any.
Evolution makes us diverse for a reason, for specialization purposes.  In all biological systems each individual has a design that makes them serve a needed function exceptionally well.  Humans on a planet are no exception... we just have the ability to go against our own desires, and have been conned into doing so.  But we are starting to see that con for what it is.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:17:18
Evolution is slow as hell, isn't it?  Everything you do always takes way longer than you planned, doesn't it?  
That's one thing I've learned from both NLP and mainstream business, timing is everything.  You can't have effective growth until the environment is ready for it.  Even the best ideas fall flat when the people, places, and things around you aren't fed up enough with their comfortable old ways to very much want to change and grow.
At least now I have some real options to make it happen.  Are you ready to help make it happen faster?

Yes and no.  Generations *overall* do have their own memes (ideas/ideologies).  Specific individuals vary of course, but there are clear trends.  My parents, which some would call Boomers (but were on the tail end of that generation, so they are a bit different), were raised with a war mindset, where everyone was scared of "the other" and thus learned to form tight units to protect themselves.  The school of fish philosophy.  Keep your head down, do what you are told, and appreciate any small gains you have in life that you got from "gentlemanly competition" in the business sense, and use those gains to enhance the protective bubble around you and your group.  It was a philosophy that the military-industrial complex used to manipulate people into being good little robots and consumers who would make and buy whatever crap they were told to.
Generation X, of which I'm at the tail end of (according to some this generation was born in the 50's and 60's) saw the emergence of the hippies as well as the aftermath of Holocaust, and learned that being so afraid of "the other" and being so ethnocentric was... well... really bad.  So we went into navel gazing, instead of competing against one another for lame jobs.  We never really escaped or changed the system, other than to make it a little easier for the next generations - Gen Y (70's and 80's) and the millennials (90's and 00's) - when they wanted to "be different".  (Being different was now promoted in the corporate world, thanks to a few Gen Xers like Steve Jobs.)  Gen Y was the beginning of the internet literate folks, and they also didn't do much except make websites.  :P
Millennials are still struggling, but, yes, they are learning to USE the internet for actually important social change.  Not a ton yet, but some.  Organizing is where we're at now, and that includes things like Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is going up because of organization.  Word of mouth is how Bitcoin spreads in popularity, and that's what social media is perfect for.  It's not so much about wanting revenge against grandparents, for Millennials, it's about changing the world in a way that improves life for future generations.  Use what your elders left you in a better way, to avoid the problems that history has demonstrated.  In this case, inequality and top-down systems.
The next generation, born in this decade and the next, I believe will totally eliminate the whole idea of us competing against ourselves and instead embrace a collaborative, creative approach to life that is decentralized and emergent, where everyone is both free to do the work that they love, AND gets the resources they need to do that work as well as possible, freely.

Money is a game, a point based system where we assign a number value to things.  There are all sorts of different kinds of points, from currencies (national and otherwise, like Bitcoin), to votes, to grades, to reddit karma, etc.  
Some of those kinds of points are readily exchanged for other kinds.  I can buy $ with Bitcoin.  I can buy votes with ¥.  Value is fluid and relative and subjective, but as long as someone, somewhere values the kinds of points that you have, you can trade them for something else.  So, we can create a UBI point system if we want.  And use those UBI's to trade in the global market.
And the way we generate the points for a point system in the first place can be any way we choose.  We are the ones who get to write the rules of the game, since it is our game.  We can choose to generate points in a similar way to how Monopoly games work, where every time a player passes a certain point in the game, they get new points.  (Banks generate new points when someone borrows points, and Bitcoin generates money when miners do work to keep the database of transactions current.)

I had a smaller, but still very significant problem with them, in that I bought some $ with a credit card there and then when I went to buy $100 worth of BTC with it (which they have a huge button for right on the trade page), they said that I wasn't buying the minimum amount.  I had no idea there was a minimum.  I'd never seen that before.  I'd been buying even $50 worth before.  But it turns out they had a minumum amount of *Bitcoin* that people could purchase, and it had gone up so much in value that I was hitting it now with even $100.
I ended up just buying more.  But it was pretty fucked up, especially since there was literally a "buy bitcoin with $100" button right there.

So far CEX was the only exchange that even completed my application process for depositing fiat.  So I had to go with them.  But they haven't been very good otherwise.  They never approved of my credit card for withdrawing fiat, and never explained why.  (It could have been something very simple, but they didn't say.)
And then the other day when I tried to use their "buy Bitcoin with $100" button, it malfunctioned.  Because they'd set their minimum BTC amount too low for the current trade value.

There is always an incentive to create, explore, and share awesome stuff in all living things.  For free.  That's what evolution does.  Except in the rare extreme cases of serious birth defects, we all naturally want to do interesting things with our lives, and because of diversity, we all want to do *different* things.  It's specialization of life.  Each cell, and each individual organism are designed to want to do different kinds of work and each one does even more specialized kind of work, joyfully, based on what the local environment needs.  That's just how life works, when it's not interfered with, or confused.
We've been interfered with and confused as a species for a while now, but natural selection even works on memes, and the con of life as Monopoly game is going extinct, rather rapidly, as we start to see that automation can easily do the things we don't want to.

There is a pattern.  It's logarithmic (powers of 10 in this case)
It hits above a power of 10 for an all time high, then drops to somewhere around 20-50% of that, then slowly climbs back to that old ATH, sits around there for a while, then shoots up to the next power of 10 for a much higher all time high.  Repeat.  
So far this is basically how Bitcoin has worked:
ATH 1: $10  
New low 1: $3  
ATH 2: $100  
New low 2: $25  
ATH 3: $1000  
New low 3: $400  
ATH 4: $10,000  
New Low 4: $3000  
ATH 5: $100,000  
New low 5: $50,000
So, if you are higher than it's ever been before, it's a good time to sell (or spend or hodl, if you want).  If it's going down from a freshly minted all time high, especially if it's significantly below it, then it's a good time to buy.
Study a nice exponential growth chart like this one for better understanding:

I'm just going to toss my thoughts into the mix.
Ultimately nature doesn't quantify value, nor use trade of any sort of individual or even small group level.
The way natural systems function is for there to be a free flow of matter and energy from wherever it is overabundant to wherever it is underabundant.
This is the basic law of thermodynamics.  It is entropy.  The law of nature.  It does NOT however, mean that everything is "balanced" or that things become boring and static over time.  It's quite the opposite, things become more complex and messy and chaotic and like that lovely fluid dynamics you see in fractals like the Mandelbrot set.
Quantitative score-keeping (the thing that currency tries to describe) is meaningless in this situation, except for the single function of conveying the information about how many somethings are "over here" and how many somethings could be useful "over there", so that it's easy to decide how many of them to send out and where to send them.  
All for free, of course.
Like how your body works.

The real purpose here is to use Bitcoin to get the things you need in order to do something awesome with your life, creating and/or exploring something really cool, rather than living out a shitty, repressed, life doing mediocre-at-best work for some employer who tells you what, where, and when to do things.

What would be the point of "backing up claims" about what you need or want?  You just ask for it.  And if it's available, the world finds a way to get it to you.
When you are free, and so is everyone else, and well cared for, your needs/wants are healthy and well within the ability of the world to give to you, for the most part.  And when we discover a new need/want, we, as a collective system look to find ways to find/make it.  That's what life is.  A large attempt to continually make things better for living things.

Yes.  It's not that complicated.  If fees are high, don't use Bitcoin.  And don't buy things like one pizza with Bitcoin.  That's mostly just a novelty.  
I bought some art (moderately priced, not like Sotheby's stuff, but not $10 craft stuff either) with Bitcoin, for example, and paid the artist directly.  I waited to make that purchase when it was sensible to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:10:26
Well, if you think the fees are too high, then don't do it.
Others of us are fine paying a couple of dollars or so for a couple hundred dollar purchase.  And since you are going to be buying things with the $ (or whatever fiat you've got) anyway, when you spend the BTC and then replace it by buying more with the fiat you would have used to buy the thing you bought, you end up with the exact same amount of BTC you started with, sans a small fee.  
AND the whole point of doing this is to promote Bitcoin to others.  If you want Bitcoin to grow in value and use, then this is a great way to do it.
But maybe you want Bitcoin to fail?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:15:48

That is the problem with a society that promotes the meme that life is a competitive Monopoly game.
It goes against everything complex organisms like humans are designed to do in life.  We're made to collaborate, create, explore, and share, freely.  
When you try to con someone into being competitive, destructive, incurious, and greedy, they get sick.
Taxes and money are inherently anti-social in nature.  "Freeloaders" are those who demand money from someone else.  Those who are actually free, do what they do out of wanting to make life better.  Which is what we're made to do, as living organisms.

If there is a *central* set of rules governing something, that everyone has to agree to to use it, it's centralized.  By definition.  
Centralized = central control.
If everyone gets to make up their own rules, it's decentralized/chaotic. 
The whole point of Bitcoin is the very rigid, solid, reliable ledger and core software that governs who gets Bitcoin and how it is moved around.  If you violate that core/central set of rules, you get booted out of the system.  For example, the famous [double spend]( problem gets solved by securing the ledger from creating two payments of Bitcoin from one. 
What Bitcoin is that most folks have decided to call "decentralized" for some reason, is distributed and (partly) democratic. Though most currencies are distributed and democratic these days, at least in democratic countries.
The real difference that I think most folks are really excited about is that Bitcoin is open source, and open to anyone who wants to participate as long as they have the money/resources to be a developer, miner, node runner, trader/hodler.  This is different from the more complex system of being elected to a national government and/or being hired/appointed to a bank or other system that makes the rules up for a currency (like the Federal Reserve in the US).
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:22:49
Most folks don't have to pay capital gains in the US:
There is a "zero capital gains rate" for "married tax filers with taxable income up to $78,750, and single tax filers with taxable income up to $39,375".
So most of us don't have to worry about it at all.
(For the record, I believe this only applies to long term (over a year) investments that are traded. Short term investments are treated like normal income.)

There are other options, I know, but they seem rare.  So I'm curious how you managed to get some Bitcoin.  Was it a gift?  Do you buy it from friends/family?  Is there a more open exchange option you use?
(I use a weird website set-up where you put your Bitcoin wallet address in and say you're going to buy some, and then go to a local store or something to buy it with cash or debit card).

The way evolution works (on all levels, including memes/cultures) is by taking old, simpler stuff apart and recombining it together in new ways.  So Bitcoin is just old stuff done as a mash-up.
The main usefulness I see to BTC is that it makes the artificial Monopoly game that we've been playing a little more natural. With Bitcoin, the individuals in power can't arbitrarily increase their point score as they can with national/corporate banking currencies. With Bitcoin, one can only ever have a set fraction of the whole without actively doing some kind of direct work or trade.  This is a more natural reflection of a system's value.  If we assign one point to every atom of material good, and one point to every watt of energy (or whatever measurement we chose), then we can quite literally assign a number value to EVERYTHING in the universe, if we really wanted, and the overall number would never change (we're talking about the laws of thermodynamics here).  The values would just move around the system, with some collecting over here, and some collecting over there, and there being almost none in the space between.
Now, Bitcoin isn't trying to do that, obviously, but it's certainly closer than fiat currencies, or even ones based on only a single material (e.g. gold).  And that seems like a useful element that has evolved.  This is the blockchain more than Bitcoin.  But Bitcoin is the first really popular use case, and it's how we're testing it out in the messy world of a planet full of humans doing whatever they want.

I'm not arguing.  I'm just offering you a better way to use Bitcoin.  It is a limited use currency, obviously.  But when you do small trades with individuals, and just send their wallets bitcoin in exchange for something they are offering, then they get interested in Bitcoin, and it becomes more popular, and the value goes up.
I've now bought a couple of pieces of art from an artist who didn't have any real bitcoin before.

You might believe that, but objective science, from neurobiology to psychology to philosophy even, doesn't even include the term "bad" when relating to entire organisms.
Bad behavior (malfunctioning organisms) on the other hand, is a reasonably scientific concept, and we know the cause of that, and it's when someone isn't getting their needs met by their environment (see: Maslow's hierarchy of needs).  
Of course, this is all moot if you believe in supernatural forces like evil spirits or devils.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:23:17
It's not magic.  It's not utopia.  It's basic biology.  It's how all living organisms eventually evolve to function.  Single individuals start coming together and specializing to form organs/organizations which collectively form organisms.  First it happened to cells, and now it's happening to us multicellular flora and fauna for a global organism.
And yes, there are people waiting in the wings to help those who have repressed their natural desires for so long that they don't know what they want to do with their lives.
Entropy drives this evolutionary process, so it's not just a good idea, it's the only way it can be.  But, yes, right now it's a fantasy.  As was space travel, cookies, and submarines at one point.  Evolution, even on a memetic scale, takes time.

Your job will indeed go away soon, as will all other jobs too.  And you, and everyone else, will be free to follow your dreams, creating and exploring and sharing the most awesome stuff in the universe.  
Police officers are only needed when humans are being repressed and rebel against that.  Once we stop repressing ourselves, and instead start taking care of ourselves, using technology, and creativity, most to the mental illness that causes us to be anti-social will disappear, and the rest can be dealt with by health professionals, rather than cops who don't know how to heal people (usually).
We're reaching a turning point, where the societal pendulum switches from swinging in a direction of violence/competition as a strategy for problem solving and growth to a direction of creativity/collaboration.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:01:15
But until you actually do the exchange for your remaining Bitcoin, you don't know if there will be a gain or a loss.  Only when you have proof of a gain, in the fiat currency, does it end up being taxed.  Otherwise you could pay taxes on a loss, which makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:40:36
If value is "always subjective" then nothing can represent value.
Which is pretty much my point here.  The only thing worth representing is the real properties of something.  Then the subjective value can be assessed by whomever wants to assess it. 
"Is this pear, that is in my bag, looking not too banged up, useful to me right now?"  
Saying that my pear is "worth" 94 Whizbangs is arbitrary and useless to me.  If I can eat it, and I want to eat it, it's literally worth a pear.  It's not actually worth anything else.  It is what it is.
If it's not worth a pear to me, now, or in the nearish future (before it rots) then it's not worth anything, and I'm not going to eat it.  But it might be worth a pear to someone else, so they should have it, so that it doesn't rot before it's no longer a pear.

Of course.  Everyone means everyone.  Ignoring anyone, through force, or accidentally, even, does us all harm, because it means that we're confused about reality.  ALL dimensions are needed to see the whole of reality.
Of course no individual one of us can collect all of the different perspectives of reality, but collectively we need to have that happen.
Also, ultimately, part of the problem is that we aren't asking for the most important information that people have to share.  What is most unique is what is most important.  And what is most unique in an individual human life is something like:
What persons, places, and things in the universe have you found most precious and valuable to your life?
What would you most love to create and/or explore in the universe, at some point in your lifetime?
What do you most need, resource-wise, for you to be able to do this most meaningful work (from the previous question)?

How would it not?
Reddit used to value free-speech highly, but now it doesn't.  That's a policy/ideology change.

Free speech is an ideology that anyone can have, or reject.  It has nothing to do with any particular government.

You definitely don't have to be 60 years or older to be a grandparent, even of a teenager, but even so, it seems fairly likely that whomever Satoshi is/was he/she/they were probably well into their middle ages when they created Bitcoin, which was 8 years ago.

Actually empathy is going up, and violence going down, as natural selection weeds out the oversized, anti-social dinosaurs of the human world.
I don't recommend actually reading the whole book by Steven Pinker, unless you really love overly detailed history, but the Better Angels of Our Nature talks about this.  And also, just looking at the statistics of how many people give resources (monetary, material, intellectual, or emotional) support to even total strangers across the planet, will help you see that we're getting more and more connected as a species, and feeling more like we are all in this together.

They meant, if you read their detailed examples, that if there were no miners, as in if you take the miners out of the system entirely, there'd be no Bitcoin as it was designed.
The decentralized menial labor of Bitcoin is all about attacks or failures with just one or a minority of miners.  But if all of them, or even a majority of them, attack or fail the system, then Bitcoin will likely be compromised.

My answer doesn't change.  There is no free, healthy anarchy anywhere on a national level.  Every human in a "modern" country feels repressed in some huge way, and can't be free to be themselves, doing awesome stuff, and playing around with new ideas and making life better for everyone as a result.

With free speech you *must* be able to scream "fire" in a crowded movie theater.  Otherwise it's literally not free speech.

That would be much less violent, since there is no actual harm being done, just ideas of harm, which are clearly very different.
Me physically preventing you from getting something you need to function well is very different from me saying that someone should prevent you from getting something that you need to function well.

I replied in a top level comment, too, but the real lesson in all of psychology, not just one study, is that having ALL of the possible reactions available to one, and picking which one of those reactions to use based on one's goals/needs and current information about what is likely to be available.

Alas, what most people think of as what Descartes was demonstrating is not what he was actually demonstrating.
The word "think" is what confuses people.  What he was really saying was more of the word "experience", and he was showing that nothing beyond "something exists" can ever be proven.  Yes, the initial premise of the movie showed that we can indeed be "wrong" about our beliefs about reality (and thus never totally prove anything), but after that it wasn't at all philosophical or intellectually challenging.

There obviously is overlap. The Baby Boomers were either the late Hippy-Yuppy generation or early Gen X.  
It really might be best to categorize groups into the decade they were born in.  But we do "generations" because that's traditional, with parents and their kids. 
As I see it, Generation X grew up in the 60's and 70's.  The term was originally used in the 1950's to apply to teens at the time, but the idea didn't really stick until the 80's (about teens then).  So the young adults in the 1980's who were already feeling depressed by the superficial, meaningless, anti-social world around us became a more official Gen X, as in, we didn't seem to "stand for" anything like the extraverted, type A personalities of our parents, I guess.

There is no good type of ignorance.  Yes, focusing on a particular topic/problem is necessary, as we can't have all of the information in our brains, but that's very, very different from censorship, where diverse data is actively repressed or dismissed as being "not important" or even "wrong".  That's always harmful, if you want to solve a problem or understand a topic fully.
If your topic/problem that you want to focus on is related to social media, human behavior, or anything even mildly related to those things, then watching Kim Kardashian and all other socially popular humans is *necessary*, quite the opposite of "lowering your IQ" (which can't happen anyway, since it's genetic, but that's beside the point).

Free speech does not have limits.  That's the entire point of the word "freedom".  If there is a limit, it's not free, it's restricted.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs explains it all pretty well.  We're completely unable to focus on larger scale systems when our basic needs aren't met.  We become sick, physically and mentally, when we don't get all the high quality nutrients, water, air, warmth, light, information, and outlets for expressing our body's excess matter and energy fully and freely from our environment.  
Having huge deficiencies in our biological needs is pretty much the normal state of all humans today, and so we're all broken and stressed and in a constant state of either fight, flight, or freeze.  (Aka, aggression/anti-social behavior, avoidant/autistic behavior, or depression/borderline behavior.)

Except that money is going extinct, like the dinosaurs before it, as it is simply too competitive, too anti-social, too unsupportive of life's goals of creating, exploring, and sharing the best stuff the universe has to offer.
Currencies, including Bitcoin, are antiquated, compared to the idea of a global (free/public) resource tracking system that can help us move the stuff that isn't needed over there, to where it is needed, over here.
Forcing ourselves to collect points to pay ourselves to run this database goes against our goals.  We want this system to work well, and so we'll just do it, freely, because it benefits us all.
@_date: 2018-09-29 14:53:00


The other way around.  We need to start taking responsibility for ALL life, rather than being competitive against life outside of our bodies.
But to do that we need to start finding better environments that support our needs better.  We can't heal until we have the resources we need to heal (see [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](  So most of us are in a catch-22, we can't take good care of others because we're not being taken good care of.  We're all stressed and either in fight, flight, or freeze mode constantly.  But we can at least be aware of what our goal is: getting our needs met so that we can help others get their needs met, so that they can help us get our needs met, and so on, in an upward spiral of increasing quality of life.

This is just another version of the password/account problem.
The simple solution is to tell those who you care about most where you keep your passwords/account info.
If you want to not keep this stuff out in the open for anyone to discover, you can make up a (random) cypher code, and give the key to those you want to entrust with your stuff after you die.  Or split things up so that half of each password or whatever is in one place and the other half in another, so that if someone stumbles on one of them they won't have everything they need to access your accounts.

Bitcoin is the opposite of equalizing the world.  It's a Monopoly game just like all the rest of the currency games.  Win the most points, by taking as many from everyone else as possible.
If Bitcoin were about equalizing things, everyone would get the same amount of BTC, and the goal would be to keep it that way, with you giving any excess you have, over the average, to someone with less than the average.

That's because it's all an act.  You don't usually make a lot of money and gain a lot of popularity by being intelligent, compassionate, reasonable, and helpful.  Money and fame are about being like a train wreck.  People who are bored and lonely want to oogle.  And our educational system and employment ideology make most people bored and lonely intentionally, since it's easier to manipulate them into making cheap crap and then buying it back.

This has nothing to do with "normal" users.  It has everything to do with the rest of us, who aren't boring, mostly useless, sticks in the mud who do nothing interesting ever.
And the problem here is not Paypal being shitty, the problem is that there is no good option.  
It's all privatized on the internet.  There is no public internet.  Only private servers, private ISPs, and private money processing services.
We need to be free to use things things unconditionally if we want a healthy society that's not forced into ignorance and repression by private companies and centralized governments.
Which is a large part of why we're here working with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:34:22

Well, ultimately all these competitive score keeping systems will go away, since they are anti-social and get in the way of healthy growth of our system.
But in the short term, Bitcoin will help humans become more global, and more aware of the irrationality of money to start with.
And, of course, with automation, and human ingenuity, most cheap stuff will be free in the very near future.  It will be more wasteful to try to keep track of small amounts of money because the market is already flooded with more than enough stuff for everyone, at least on the cheap stuff level.  We already have way to many t-shirts, and coffee mugs, and pens, and so on.  There's really no point in charging money for things that people throw away.  We can simply automate the reuse of them.

I don't need to propose anything, we're already here in the Bitcoin community.
We need a full internet option that works similarly to Bitcoin, but truly decentralized (no democratic/mob-rule forced use of a specific code/ledger/rules).  We need a distributed network for social media.
This isn't centralized governments, but truly public systems, where no individual or group is in control, but everyone is free to do it their own way, and use it however they want. 
I imagine that each community (ideological or geographic) will have their own servers, and host whatever content they want to host, coming from all over the community, and other communities that they choose to host, along with at least some random content, to keep things healthy and diverse.  Individuals will be free to join whatever communities resonate with them, based on organizational style and shared interests.  Individuals will be free to access any data that is shared publicly by any community servers, and can share any content they want to which fits into the community's standards.  There will, of course, be some totally open communities, with no rules at all, because we need those totally public forums.
As for how long it takes to do this, that depends on who comes up with a robust core structure for a universal media content hosting language that can be easily adapted by anyone who wants to.
I was at a wonderful talk at MIT by an artist/coder recently, Eric Loyer, and he said something pretty cool that was essentially asking the world for a standardized tool for storing and rearranging media content so that it can be used like LEGOs, so that we can continually construct and share the most important narratives to our lives.
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:23:50


Actually, it kind of does.  People tend to get the most offensive (trying to harm other's ability to meet their needs, and live their lives as they wish) when they feel threatened by something.
No one feels threatened by something that they believe is total fiction and/or pure silliness.  It takes at least partial truths, stuff that hits close to home, so to speak, for people to get scared.  So many people are taught to be dishonest and secretive and hide their real selves, that any even close to honest discussion terrifies them, to the point of violence (usually not physical, but emotional, intellectual, and even philosophical, attacking the ability of others' freedoms of speech and employment and commerce and so on).

The real problem we have is a lack of focus.  We're distracted by too much pointless "filler" in life, due to this insane virus meme that says that life is a miserable, scary competitive game, and so most folks aren't paying attention to actually doing the important stuff that we really need/want to do to make the world awesome.

There are regulations in many places both restricting the freedoms of individuals at companies, and making it illegal to restrict the freedoms of others by companies. 
This is what the whole net neutrality discussion is about. Phone companies in the US can't legally censor or discriminate calls based on content, because we believe that everyone needs to have their ability to communicate with consensual partners freely.

Reality is the opposite.  We are created by nature and nurture.  Everything we are is what the universe empowered us to be.  We are given this power by evolution to take good care of future generations.
But if we fail to use, or even acknowledge, this power to create and explore and share awesome stuff with the world, then we are powerless.
(And we fail to believe in our power and/or use it, when we aren't given a reason to believe it, or the ability to use it, by the universe.  We are what we were made to be and what that is is random, from our perspective.)

It's not.  That's the monetary transfer service that's being interfered with.  Which is why we're here talking about it on the Bitcoin community.
There are two different issues here.  The censorship thing and the restricting people from transferring/using money thing.


It wasn't.  It was relevant to the problem of their ONLY being private services available.
It's also the case that Paypal is a shitty company when they start discriminating against people just because they don't agree with their words.  I have been avoiding using them since a decade or so ago when they started freezing accounts of people who were doing interesting things that the conservative owners of Paypal didn't like.


And absolutely no public internet monetary processing services.

It has to do with personality type.  Some humans have a sort of steady state approach to reality, where they think that everything in the future will be basically the same as the past.  And then some far more rare human brains see how things change dramatically over time, an expect some weird stuff to happen in the future.
Bucky Fuller was a visionary like that, with an idea of how weird things would be in his future (and still will be).  He was one of the few visionaries who was pretty well liked even in the academic areas, but most of us are dismissed as woo woo freaks.

Um, what?  What are you talking about?  Who ever said that shelters are not better than being forced to be outside?  That's silly.
What I did say is:




We are comparing shelters vs. actually effective organizations.  No one ever mentioned comparing shelters to being forced to be outside.
Giving to the places that actually aim to stop homelessness is far, far, far more productive than giving to places that keep people homeless.  It's just basic logic.  If you actually want to solve the problem, that is.
A lot of people don't, though.  A lot of people actually like there to be homeless folks, stuck in shelters.  I never imagined that would be the case, but having been in and around many of these organizations and people, I've found that many of them like the status quo, not just because they rely on it for their jobs/money, but also because it means less work for them, and that lame work can still make them feel "good" about themselves.  I've heard so many of the people who are employed at shelters and their related organizations effectively say "You should be glad I came in today.  Otherwise you wouldn't be able to do anything."  As if we were pathetic invalids who needed their protection.
As soon as I come in and actually want to solve the problem, most of these folks get freaked out and try to ignore or dismiss me, or worse.

Only as long (not long now!) as we agree to play this anti-social, artificial point scoring game of money (and grades, and votes, etc.) that makes us compete against ourselves instead of collaborating and being free.
Nature doesn't have this artificial, boring Monopoly game approach to life, instead it has a creative, fun, playful, collaborative approach where everyone is free to do what they naturally want to do, which is some kind of creating and/or exploring work that benefits evolution in some way.  Humans just had to try out doing it the wrong way for a while (evolution is slow, so this "while" was several millennia) before we're starting to realize how moronic it is, so we can go back to being free and happy and productive the way we were before we invented zero-sum trading and money.
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:20:06
Blockchain has nothing to do with money.  Blockchain is simply a network of computers keeping track of where things are, using robust checks and backups.
Bitcoin uses that to keep track of Bitcoin.  Which is like the beta testing version of the real thing that will keep track of actually valuable resources in a global system.
A healthy system isn't in equilibrium, it's growing, because everyone in it has a shared goal of improving things.
@_date: 2018-09-29 19:53:44
That's the viral meme that is destroying human society, which also affects the health of all of the other Earthlings sharing the planet with us.
But some humans are either immune or have found a way to heal from it's effects, and so we're going to be reversing the trend of destruction/competition soon.
Which is why I see Bitcoin as the last gasp, helping us see the insanity of the Monopoly game meme, while developing a truly useful global resource tracking system for us to help find the stuff we need when we need it from the freely shared resources.

That's not how it worked in the past.  But the future is always different from the past.
Bitcoin is a waste of energy, since it doesn't actually generate anything truly useful, but it is only a test project.  A global database of available resources, which the Bitcoin blockchain platform will evolve into, will be robust and resilient and one of the most efficient things ever, especially once the beta testing is over and we sort out how to do it with a minimum of energy.  So the test project of Bitcoin is useful in the long run, even if it is, itself, not doing anything valuable.

That's the opposite of freedom.
Freedom means that everyone is free to choose how to interact with others, and that interactions are always consensual.
If you force anyone to interact with someone they don't want to interact with, that's evil, and if you prevent parties from interacting with one another when they do want to interact, that's also evil.  
BOTH sides of freedom are required for us to actually be free.
Right now we have neither.

For example, you.  Calling someone else "arrogant" is... well... pretty much what arrogance is, isn't it?
Me?  I'm just aware of what I understand well and what I don't.  I'm no better or worse than anyone else, overall.  But I do understand some things better than most because I had a better education.

There are no facts in the human realm, as Descartes reminded us (Cogito egro sum points out that the only thing one can be entirely sure of is that something, one's awareness, exists.  Beyond that, anything we believe could be an illusion.)

@_date: 2018-09-04 21:43:12
Voluntary collaboration never involves force or demands.
As soon as you start using force (violence of some sort, be it physical or not) and making demands, you remove individual freedom to do the right thing.  We're born to do the right thing, and when you try to make people compete against one another, that all falls apart.
Prosocial behavior is collaborative, not competitive.  If you try to take something away from me, that's competition.
@_date: 2018-09-16 14:26:30
Force of any kind is repression, yes.  Which is what privacy is.
You can't be forced to give information you don't want to give.  That's just not how reality works.
But you can try to withhold information from others, which harms everyone, due to it creating confusion and misunderstanding.
Keeping information to yourself is not freeing.  It's repressing yourself.  


Freedom is the ability to choose where I poop.  If there is a camera in a bathroom, a healthy society would both make that information public (not keep it private), and allow everyone to choose where they poop, and what kinds of bathrooms they build and share.
In a healthy, free society, there would be individuals who have no problem pooping in public (non-humans do it all the time, and humans have for most of history, and some still do), and there would be individuals who were interested in collecting data about pooping who could study those who poop publicly, while others would choose to be less public about their pooping, and would choose to do it away from cameras and windows and whatever, and no one would feel the need to bother them, since there would be plenty of folks who were public about it to observe.

Not maybe.  It's basic science.  Growth is *taking in new material/information*.  You literally cannot expand without introducing new material into your system.
You have to inhale before you can exhale.  You have to put gas in a car before it can move you.  You have to be given language before you can speak.  You have to be offered money before you can use it.
Yes, you do have to make sure that your own needs are met before others (except in some rare cases of sacrifice for future generations), which is why I said that most of us have enough BTC to spare right now.  If you don't have enough, then obviously don't give what you have away.
But this is indeed how I actually got a Bitcoin account in the first place.  Some folks donated a few pennies to me.
It's called pay it forward.
Also, since this is a pyramid scheme, the more people we get into BTC the more valuable it will be compared to fiat.  And if that's something you want (it might not be), then it's a good investment to give some away.

Well, women make less money than men, on average, so they don't have as much to invest even when they want to.  And they are more likely to [support other individuals, financially,]( like aging parents and kids, and friends, and women are more likely to invest in non-profit work (which pays off in a better world, rather than in monetary profits) than men, who tend to be more likely to only take care of themselves.  So women naturally have less to invest in the more mainstream make-money-with-money schemes.
But also, women are, on average, less likely to take big risks with practical stuff in their lives (though they tend to take more emotional and philosophical risks), and so they tend to keep their money close to them, and in savings accounts and such.
Also, women-owned companies are invested in at a lower rate.

What's bad is when there is no publicly owned option where you were always free, instead of being forced to use a private service.

@_date: 2018-09-30 15:29:00
Bitcoin's computers are distributed, just like the US Senate's members come from different states.  This has nothing to do with who makes the rules, and whether they are centralized, in a small group or individual, or decentralized, being generated individually, with everyone being free to have their own rules.


That's not open.  Remember, we're talking about the power/control of the rules that a system functions with.  You are absolutely not free to change Uber's software, even if you have all of the other Uber voting with you.  Only Uber's CEO/Board and their designated powers-that-be are allowed to decide what the rules are.  
Uber is both private and centralized.
Bitcoin is centralized and open/public.  Anyone can change the rules, if they have enough others voting with them.


Exactly.  That's a democracy, which is a centralized authority/control of the rules that is created by mob rule/majority voting.
@_date: 2018-09-30 16:20:04
Oh, and in general the structure of a centralized versus decentralized system is shown by where the rules are and how influence flows.
A centralized system has one set of rules, and the influence flows in a linear way, from one individual or group outward to everyone else in the system.  It's a top-down power structure.  Obviously there are different ways to get to the top, but if you are not at the top, you don't have a say in what the rules are.
In a decentralized system everyone has their own set of rules, which can be as different as they want from other's rules.  And the power is in the individuals and flows into the center/up.  This is a natural, emergent, system, where the behavior of the whole is completely defined by the collective behavior of the individuals in the system, and is thus unpredictable from any individual's perspective.
A brain is a good example of this decentralized system, where each neuron chooses when to fire and how often to fire and whatnot, based on it's own design and the information it's getting from outside itself.  Each neuron has at least a slightly different set of rules for what it does, and thus, the whole brain is unpredictable, and it seems like we have "free will".  
That's the opposite of the goal of a centralized system, where those designing it and using it want it to be "secure" and predictable.  When you make a transaction, or mine a block, or whatever you wanna do in Bitcoin, you want it to work the way that it's "supposed to" work.  Not spit out some unexpected result.  In a natural, decentralized system, you have a goal of creativity and change, instead.

It should be based on demand.  That's the only logical way to go.  The more computers people need to add to do the calculations, the more it should cost.  Of course, as computing power increases exponentially, the fewer computers will be needed, so things tend to balance out reasonably well.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:26:58
If you don't understand that life is random, then you will indeed be very confused, in everything you do.
But randomness is a pattern.  Probability does things in a certain way.
You can't predict anything completely, but the likelihood of things ending up going a certain way is high, at least with the more natural processes of life.
So, yes, Bitcoin is very likely to keep being adopted at an exponential rate, which is why we have the pretty reasonable prediction of it being worth $1,000,000 within a few years.

No.  Because you're not preventing anyone from using a platform for expressing their ideas and feelings.  Unless there is someone else in the apartment who wants to hear what's going on outside.


Obviously yes.  Prison is one of the most fucked up ideas humanity ever invented, making life worse on a huge scale for everyone.  Harming people who are sick, or just different, is the opposite of helping them.  It's like trying to treat physical illness by chopping off limbs and bloodletting.  It's barbaric.


I don't.  But many do.  Still doesn't make it healthy.  I just ate a bunch of junk food and I feel crappy.  We all do shitty things that harm ourselves and others.  The goal is to find ways to not do those shitty things.

Breathe in.  Breathe out.
Do that.  With everything in your life.
This is what evolution made life to do, create, explore, and share the best things possible that improve life for current and future generations.
The signals we humans care about are qualitative.
Sure, it's nice to know that there are 20 ounces of apples in the kitchen, but it's far more useful to know where there are more apples if I need them in the near future, or that my neighbor wants some apples to make a nice salad for dinner, so that we can easily move things from where they are to where they are most useful.
Quantities of physical resources can be kept track of by computers if we really need them to, while we can keep track of what's important to us using simple qualitative measurments such as "Thanks, that's really helpful!", "No, thanks, I'm good." and "That's pretty good, but I'd really like..."

Everything you think and feel deserves to be protected because it's you.  You are a human being (I imagine), and that means you have a basic need to experience life and share your experiences with others, so that we all can learn about reality from all of the different perspectives.

Bitcoin is the beta testing version of blockchain.  Once we are done testing it out, we'll get rid of the gamification of the system, and use it for what it's really meant to be used for, which is keeping track of public resources so they can be easily found and moved to wherever they are most needed.  Right now almost all resources are going to waste, which is insanely bad for all of us.

C: I'm a Gen X'er the generation who actually started the whole rejection of money as God, and tried to figure out a better way to live, without the stupid shit that we were forced to choose from when we walked into a store.  We were the ones who started Apple, Ben and Jerry's, and food coops, with an ideology of making/selling a better product that actually did what we wanted.  We didn't get very far, of course, but we were the ones who started the rebellion against cheap plastic crap made by children in poor countries.

A new viral meme that points out that being free, to do what we naturally love — [creating, exploring, and sharing the most awesome stuff for the benefit of those we care about in life]( — for free, is far more beneficial and necessary for a thriving planet than competing against ourselves for imaginary points.
I'm working on making it appealing to the masses.  I'm not there yet.
I've finally realized that to get to a point where this meme will stick, I have to first get past their immune system, which has been coopted by the "life as an unpleasant competition" meme.

I don't recommend them, and it takes a ton of verification to get into their system, but cex.io is an exchange that allows credit card payments.  I don't know what the fees are now, and your credit card company might treat it as a cash advance (with extra fees), and they have minimum crypto purchase orders (maybe around $150? or so, depending on how they are feeling that week, it seems).
But they do work.  Just make sure to transfer the Bitcoin out into your own wallet, and don't leave it on there.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:43:41
And remember, the number one problem with Bitcoin right now (and in the past to some extent) is the backlog of approvals for accounts on mainstream exchanges.

As long as the constraints are natural and emergent by the very structure of the group, then it's good.  If there is a power imbalance and an attempt to control others, through artificial constraints, i.e., if the rules are non-consensual, then things will be broken and harmful.
And it doesn't matter what size group it is, two individuals, or 50 billion.  Free systems where individuals are able to do what they were made to do (improve life in some way), then it's all good.
@_date: 2018-09-13 19:37:42
That seems to have nothing to do with the claim that Bitcoin has a goal of equalizing the world.
Equalization, as I said, would involve everyone getting the same amount of currency (or at least their regular income would be equal).
And democracy is anti-social, as it makes life a competitive game, rather than a collaborative one.
What Bitcoin is good for is beta testing the blockchain, to create a healthy system for keeping track of freely available (public) resources, so that when someone needs something, it can be easily found and sent to where it's needed, efficiently and freely.

Privacy is the opposite of freedom.  Privacy is repression.  And it goes against the laws of nature.

Because it's literally restricting or removing content from a platform for any reason.  
Yes, telling someone to shut up is pretty much censorship, or at least an attempt to do it.  If you don't actually have the power to stop someone from sharing information then you can't really censor them, but you can still try.

Everyone is on the same page, underneath the superficial silliness of mainstream media.  We are all governed by the same basic function of selfish genes that really just want to make mutated copies of the sets of genes that already exist but evolve them to be better adapted (higher fitness) to a wide variety of environments, so that life can keep getting better for life, and keep expanding outward in space and in diversity (life gets weirder and more specialized while also getting more collaborative), as entropy requires.

Bitcoin itself is a waste though, since it doesn't produce anything of value in an of itself.  The blockchain is what offers resiliency and protection from network failures.

You could say that Bitcoin is a role playing game, in a sense.  We pretend that it's valuable, for fun.  Just like all the other currencies regardless of what platform they are used in.

Bitcoin is centralized.
An actually decentralized thing has everyone using their own rules.
Think: art.  You can make art any way you want.  No one else governs your creation and use of art.
What Bitcoin is is a centralized system that anyone who has the resources and skill to participate can, to some extent.  Though Satoshi and the developers have the most control, and are the biggest central hub.

It does have something to do with income, but that's not the whole story, I agree.
Gender does have a lot to do with it.  Or the genderdness (that's probably not a word...) of our bodies at the time, at least.
Each hormone makes us take risks in a different way.
Dopamine makes us take physical risks.
Estrogen makes us take emotional (interpersonal) risks.
Testosterone makes us take intellectual (strategic/group-dynamics) risks.
And serotonin makes us take philosophical (cultural/spiritual) risks.
Males, on average, have more dopamine and testosterone activity in their brains.  While females have more estrogen and serotonin.
So we do risky things in different ways.

If it is a centralized government, then yes, it's centralized, and there are rules that you are supposed to obey.  But the reality is that life only obeys the real, natural, bottom up rules of nature.


Your body's DNA is many and varied.  Homosapiens alone has two different sets of DNA and then the body has thousands of other kinds of cells, not homosapiens, that all work independently to make up the collaborative system that is you.  The universe itself, as a whole, is centralized, probably.  But individual things moving through the universe interact "freely" (aka, unpredictably from our perspective).  Though that gets into some pretty deep cosmology/metaphysics.


That's not art.  Art has nothing to do with money.  Art isn't something that is bought or sold.  Art is the expression of an idea in a medium.  The choice of how to make something is art.  And no one but you decides that.  There are no central rules about how to draw a drawing, or sing a song, or tell a joke.  Other than the laws of nature, of course.


That's not science.  Science is looking at how different individuals relate to one another within a larger environment.  You can choose any individuals and environment you want to observe.  There is no central authority governing your decision of what to compare, except, again, the laws of physics.
If there is a centralized system trying to force some set of rules on others, then it's not a free, natural system.  It's artificial.  Except for the universe.  Maybe...


That's not philosophy/culture.  That's an artificial construct that tries to be philosophy/culture, but fails, ultimately, because nature is the only true power.
Of course, the fact that artificial systems do exist (temporarily) means that nature made them happen.  Ultimately everything is natural and centralized (deterministic), but because reality is probably a whole lot like a Mandlebrot fractal, we can differentiate the simple, predictable patterns from the more complex, unpredictable patterns, of stuff happening.  That's what I see as centralized versus decentralized.

No, the IDEA itself is sick.  The execution doesn't matter.  Harming people is harmful no matter how you do it.  And it's clearly far worse when it's non-consensual.  (Things like surgery do harm, but when consensual, and to aim to fix a problem, are fine.)

I don't *want* to define censorship in any way.  I'm just telling you the basic definition that has been used for millennia.
There is a huge difference between you choosing what information you want to explore and censorship.  I think you're not seeing how that works.  Censorship is physically preventing you from accessing information you want to access, and/or preventing you from sharing information you want to share.

When looking at data from a scientific perspective (or beyond, from a philosophical perspective), you don't look at the literal meaning of what someone is saying as much as you are looking at the context, the reasoning, the relationships and factors that surround the situation.
There are no lies in human behavior.  It's all real.  Don't take the words literally when seeking the whole story, look at why it's being said...
You, for example, are saying what you're saying because you're scared of a world where there are different perspectives, because you were taught that only one perspective (the parents/teachers/employer/media that you grew up surrounded by) was acceptable for life.

And even if you didn't use it to live on, you could use it to store stuff.  My storage space costs $100 a month, which is a lot of money.  To just store stuff.  If someone had a space that I could freely put my storage on (maybe in a cheap shed, or whatever), that would on it's own be useful.

I always found it weird that people thought the Matrix was so special.  It seemed simple-minded and old fashioned to me when it came out.  But then I was always a bit ahead of my time, and spent my teenage years reading sci-fi and philosophy, so I'd known about these ideas for decades before the movie came out, and seemed mostly to be an excuse to use special effects and fancy stunt fights.

Not even Bitcoin is decentralized.  It's governed by Satoshi + the developers and a little bit by the miners, nodes, and owners.
But it is essentially "open" which is useful (anyone can be a developer, miner, node, owner, if you have the resources to make it happen).
Other crypto is often very centralized, and private.  Which is where Bitcoin sets itself apart, it's centralized, but open.

Families where everyone is free to do what they were designed to do, instead of having authoritarian/artificial "rules" absolutely work well.
I was just listening to a podcast from NPR called Hidden Brain talking about research on what makes the most successful innovators, and it turned out to have a lot to do with whether their parents focused on rules or values in raising the kids.  Those who didn't have rules forced on them were more successful adults because they learned to think long term and collaboratively, around goals and ideals, which made them more able to find good solutions to making a company, project, or organization work well.

You could make a monetary game point collecting/trading game that was as fair as possible by giving everyone an equal income every month (or whatever period you want) and then having a rule where the points would decrease over time dramatically (maybe 50% every month), reflecting how real resources work, as real things tend to fall apart, go bad, or become obsolete.  This way hoarding is disincentivized.  The goal of such an economy would be to have everyone using their money as much as possible, and trading it for things they like/want that others are offering.  This way the productivity and flow of the system is at it's maximum, but those who are sick, or otherwise incapacitated in some way can still get their basic needs met with the *truly* Unconditional Basic Income, even if they have very little, or even nothing to sell that month.
Of course, once we do this little thought experiment and really understand how it works, we discover that this is pretty much how all healthy systems work in nature, only without anyone officially keeping track of the point scores, and the rules not needing to be consciously discussed.  
Healthy systems in nature have individuals simply doing the work they were born to do, that they find intrinsically rewarding to do, and then freely sharing any extra outputs that they have no need for.  For example we humans breath out carbon dioxide, and trees breath it in, and exhale oxygen, which we breathe in.

The opposite.  Life is a creative force, always generating more diversity, more effectiveness, and more awesomeness for future generations (in the long run at least).  Evolution always improves the use of resources, taking raw materials and making them more valuable over time.
Money is the opposite.  It's destructive by design, limiting the use of resources as much as possible, since the goal of money is to have it (saving/hoarding), not spend it, which reduces the flow of resources dramatically.  This is why humanity is so primitive, even though we know how to be advanced.  All the people with good ideas that will help the whole planet don't have access to the resources they need to implement them, because those with the resources are holding them hostage, and demanding money for them, money that they are also hoarding, so that no one can use it to buy the resources they are hoarding.
Bitcoin is, as I see it, the last gasp of a dying meme of life as a zero sum Monopoly game for collecting points.  Bitcoin represents the purest version of money, which forces us to see it for what it really is, arbitrary, useless at best, and deadly at worst.
But as with all things in evolution, even memes, there is always something valuable to take from it, and in this case I see Bitcoin as being the beta testing for a global system (blockchain) of keeping track of freely available resources.  Once we're ready to let the life as a competitive, repressive game meme go extinct, and embrace the natural life as a collaborative, creative game meme, the Bitcoin system will be robust enough to handle the task of keeping track of all of the freely shared resources so that when someone has a good idea, they can easily get the things they need to make it happen.

Bitcoin is all of that, compared to the old fashioned government/corporate currencies.  But yes, all things go extinct, with memes doing so far more quickly than genes.  The whole concept of a zero-sum, competitive approach to life is going to die out just like the over-sized, overly-simplistic, unfit dinosaurs, as it's replaced by a more social-animal meme of collaboration and compassion and creativity that it more fitting of a thriving world.

So everything that needs to get done for life to flourish does, freely.
Money makes us go against that, and makes us do stupid shit that makes life worse.

I'm not sure what horror story universe you are imagining, but in the real world all humans naturally want to create and explore and share awesome things.  That means art, science, culture, etc.
Remember the old Age of Enlightenment?  When a small segment of humanity became free to do whatever they wanted, instead of having to slave away just to survive?  What did they do?  They invented all kinds of science/technology, explored all sorts of parts of life, and created a wide range of diverse cultural innovation.
If you also look at little kids, before they are indoctrinated into the anti-social memes of life as a repressive quantitative competition (grades, votes, money, etc.) naturally make and do stuff and share it with their friends, family, and total strangers.  That's mostly ALL they want to do.  Make and do cool stuff that improves life.
I make deodorant myself because it's fun.  I make more than I need.  I share it.  Because evolution designs me to make and do cool stuff and share it to improve the quality of life overall. 
This is just what healthy organisms do.  If you're not naturally excited about making and doing and sharing the most useful and valuable stuff that improves life overall, then you're broken, and need help.
You're not made to be a robot.  That's what we make robots for.  They are the factory workers.  Not humans.  Humans become broken when they are forced to do work that is uncreative, incurious, and greedy (non-free).
Which is why nearly all parts of human society are so fucked up and every human is so sick now.  We're hugely repressed and not free to do the work we want to do.

Remember, though, that there are good reasons NOT to wait, if you are either:

2. You don't trust the individual claiming to give you another one later
And remember that marshmallows, ultimately, are bad for your health, so sometimes you might not even want to eat any of them at all.
The MOST successful individuals (the happiest, most creative, most compassionate, and most effective) individuals are aware of ALL of the options and WHEN they might be most useful.
This is the real lesson of psychology, beyond the overly simplistic experiments in academic research.  You have to put it all together, and see the range of options, and how useful it is to be adaptable to diverse situtuations.

Yes, technically we're all free.  But if that is the case, why are we all agreeing to participate in the banking system and not following our dreams but instead looking to compete against one another for money and votes and grades?
It's because we are not just our genes but our environment.  We don't know that we can be free, as we're raised to believe it's not possible.  We're raised to believe that we only have the option to give up on our dreams and enter the rat race.
We like to pretend that we are in control of ourselves, but science shows that our behaviors are entirely biological, resulting from genes and environment.  Not some supernatural force that allows us to escape the programs we're given.  I mean, if you do believe in some kind of supernatural force, then that's also a product of your environment, from my perspective.  You are what you are made to be, not what you choose to be.

30% linearly or 30% exponentially?
Because they are hugely different.
Bitcoin, and other naturally growing things in the universe, grows exponentially (adoption-wise, not necessarily value-wise, since value is relative to something else's value).
Right now we're about 80% of the million dollar prediction line for the end of 2020 (or maybe just a bit later).  Which is well within normal fluctuations of a complex system.  If we were up just 20% right now, measured exponentially (on a logarithmic scale) we'd be at $18,000.  
By the end of the year, the nominal value compared to US$ will be $29,000, with normal fluctuations allowing it to reach up to around $75,000 as a new all time high (dropping back down again to somewhere around or below the line).

The problem that the video talks about is a larger problem with the process of competition and zero-sum games (like money/currencies).  They go against nature (the laws of physics) which is why they fail so readily.
Collaboration IS the best approach to the real world, but miners are forced to compete.  So it sets up this situation where the system has to be vulnerable to failure.
A healthy system that's using blockchain software to keep track of resources (real things, like apples, socks, trains, cats, whatever) won't have the problem of competition and point hoarding that Bitcoin and other blockchain cryptocurrencies have.

Remember though that we are comparing the top-down/centralized approach of an individual or small group creating a thing that gains value to a bottom-up, decentralized approach where everyone can create the thing, which is still valued.  For example the difference between the banking system's $ and growing food.
The shape of one is a top-down pyramid, and the shape of the other one is a square.  In the pyramid shaped approach the ones who make the thing, or are early adopters, gain more as the value increases as more individuals want it.  In the square, everyone has the same value no matter when they start, because anyone can generate the thing whenever they want.

Nothing is a proven fact other than Descartes' "I think (experience) therefor I am (exist)."  So other than me existing, I can't ever prove anything.
And what Maslow, and many others have seen over the years is the basic developmental stages of life.  The terms we use to describe those stages, and the details obviously vary, but the general growth patterns of moving from the center outwards in a sort of spiral, is pretty universal.  Maslow's hierarchy IS evolutionary psychology.  It's even neuroscience.  And physics.  Only he didn't know that.
And David Sloan Wilson is great too.  But his stuff is much less logical, and more arbitrary.  It's got some good details to add to the overall pattern, though, and I've definitely learned a few things to add to the developmental process due to his work.  Sloan Wilson is a detail guy, while Maslow was the systems theory, big picture guy (like me).


Yes, Frankl had more of what he needed than others did, resource-wise, and so could be up higher on the hierarchy, in the self-transcendent states.  Frankl is an excellent demonstration of Maslow's description of the developmental stages working as they were designed (by evolution).  Once you've had those "deficiency needs" met (the bottom four in [the hierarchy map]( at some point suddenly gain the ability to be self-sacrificing for others, because they can focus less on the lower needs.  But you have to have had all of those lower needs met first, pretty unconditionally.  Then you gain this higher sense of purpose, or "the why" in Frankl's words.
Of course, even those who've had their deficiency (physical and emotional) needs met well before can slide back into focusing on them if they are seriously unmet for too long, which is why even the best of humanity can resort to fight/flight/freeze responses when extra stressed.
Also, there are different personalities, with natural brain design variation, and some humans are born with "more" of what we need to function well at those higher levels, than others.  Genes are right at the very bottom of the hierarchy, as the physical inputs that make us who we are.  And if we get good ones, our bodies will be more efficient with the resources we get, while those of us with crappy genes will be less efficient, and not be able to use the resources we are given as well, and thus become more deficient more easily.


There are two processes in physics, contraction -&gt;&lt;- and expansion &lt;--&gt;.  Contraction is where similar things come together to form a new whole, and expansion is where things that are different move apart.  This is the negative and positive forces of electromagnetism. This is the strong and weak nuclear forces.  This is gravity (which pushes things together and pulls things apart, depending on certain physical relationships between things).
This is evolution!
This is our brains!
We look for similarities and differences and use them to solve problems that need us to recognize how we can rearrange stuff to better suit life.  To create something new, we need to see how different things are actually similar, so that they can fit together in some interesting way (sex!).  And to understand something old, we need to see how similar things are different, so that we can sort out why they did what they did.

All data is data.

Each one must be different, and is naturally incomplete and "fake news" in many ways, but they are nonetheless necessary for getting a reasonable picture of what the building is actually going to be.  That's how understanding reality works.  All of the different perspectives are necessary.  Including the ones from scared and angry individuals.
But if you want to be ignorant, intentionally dismissing (or attacking) data because it's different from the data you like, then go for it.

Bitcoin is supposed to be free, not regulated.  And you're supposed to be your own bank, not use some corporate one.  Bitcoin is peer-to-peer.  Try using it the way it was made to be used.

And it seems that it's you who have no idea what I'm talking about here.  That's normal.  Almost no one studies systems theory, biology, psychology, sociology, and physics in the way I have done, to the point of really understanding developmental processes on a planetary level.
There have never been any actual socialist or Communist nations.  Your body is a Communist system though.  It's a group of individuals with a shared goal of being healthy (getting their input needs) and free to do what they love doing (getting their output needs).
It's also how all other living organisms work: freedom to do whatever work one naturally wants to do, and free resources.
No difficult labor.  Because if you find it hard, then you're doing it wrong.  Good work is fun and feels challenging but easy, which is why we call peak performance the "[flow state](

Yes, it absolutely should be legal for a private company or individual to decide how they want to interact with others.

This year's all time high is next year's low.  So, yes, buy at the all time high if you happen to have the money then.  Otherwise buy it at a point where it's lower than it was a month ago.
When I have money to stick into my Bitcoin savings account I tend to wait a week or three to see when it goes down a fair bit, and then buy.  It doesn't matter what the price is, otherwise.  
Then if I really want to spend it, I wait until an all time high.

But since there is no good Reddit space that most folks know about for talking about complex topics about centralization and authoritarian governments (political or corporate or otherwise), things like this have to be wedged into other spaces where they can be seen and discussed, and have an audience that has at least some shared ideals (which Bitcoin aficionados do, as it relates to heavily authoritarian, private monetary transfer systems).

Attention seeking is attention seeking no matter what the audience is.

The Zuckerberg generation were trying to make cool shit that everyone enjoyed.  Which kinda worked, but it's all fairly soulless.
The Millennials (or Generation Z, aka those born around the turn of the century) are sort of lost and trying to find their souls.  That's what you see in their social media, a whole lot of experimenting and flailing and attempts to figure out of humanity even has a future.  Most of them don't even want to have a big audience, and would prefer that everyone except their friends just fuck off.

This is why Bitcoin was invented (in a large part, anyway).  To provide a far more publicly owned currency service.


I'm not arguing, because arguing is useless and silly.  I'm simply pointing out that all information is valuable, if you care about the whole of reality and modeling it in the most accurate way.  Every individual has a unique perspective of life, and if you are ignoring or dismissing any one of them is biasing your dataset, that's primarily harmful to you, making you ignorant.  I have no interest in that.  Maybe you don't care about being accurate and effective in modeling reality, but I do.
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:59:37
It absolutely affects you when diverse perspectives are repressed.  You don't get to learn about reality.  It makes you ignorant.
The only way to create an accurate model of reality is to seek out all the *different* views of it, not just a single side.  Imagine trying to build a building with only the front view, and actively ignoring the side view, and top view, simply because they were different...

There isn't any.  It's like trying to punish your car into changing it's spark plugs.  It's illogical.  But we're made illogical.  Because for creativity to happen (and life to evolve to a technological stage where the selfish genes can propagate out into the universe, beyond the Earth's cozy little womb) brains need to be able to think outside the box, to come up with wild and weird ideas, and try them out.  Most fail, but the ones that allow life to flourish due to technology are the ones that natural selection keeps around.  So, yes, we have to have bad ideas in order to have good ones.  Eventually the bad ideas, the unfit memes, go extinct, or nearly extinct.  Like crocodiles.
As for the future, it is very likely already set, but, because all possible things that can happen do happen, in *some* timeline, ALL possible futures will happen.  We're more likely to end up in the more average, life goes on, one, but you never know which one your particular consciousness will be aware of going through.

If it's voluntary, there isn't an exchange.  If I give you something of my own volition, then it's not because I am getting something in return.  If I try to force you to give up something you have before I let you have something I have, then that's not voluntary.  That's a con.  That's profiteering.  That's a game where one individual loses and another wins.  Only one is happy.  The other might be not entirely unhappy, but not happy either. 
Think about the real resources that your body uses to live.  Think about breathing.  Do you wait until someone out there is willing to trade money or some other random resource before you exhale?  Or do you voluntarily exhale because you *want* to?
If you had a goal of making a profit, you'd die.
This is how healthy living systems work.  They don't repress themselves, and instead are free. That's the real free market economy.
If you are hoarding things you don't need, and demanding money, or some other resource, in trade before you do what you really want and need to do, you are going to get sick.  Which is what we all are.  And that's how we are conned into making and buying the cheapest crap for the most resources, either by corporations or their governments.
Only fully independent non-profits, run by and for the individuals they serve, voluntarily (not as a job) actually have a motivation to make the highest quality stuff (because they are using it themselves) for the fewest resources (because it's their resources, not someone else's).

The goal is accuracy, not "looking better". :P
Most things in nature grow exponentially, at least initially, until they become "normal" in whatever relative sense.  In the case of a currency, we're talking about mainstream adoption.  So we use a "logarithmic" scale (which is really exponential, just to confuse you).

It's more like try to imagine how it possibly could be decentralized...
Decentralization is a bottom-up, emergent process where everyone does their own thing (their own rules) and because of that the overall direction the organism is highly unpredictable, and definitely not controllable.
Bitcoin, as with any currency, has a central, shared, set of rules which everyone has to follow.  They might change if there is a mob rule (democracy) vote to do so, but otherwise everyone has to do the same thing if they want to participate.
What is different about Bitcoin is that it's public/open, rather than the usual privately run system.  Anyone can join the developers, miners, nodes if they have the resources, rather than having to apply and be accepted by some authority.  You can't just decide to print Euros or Yen even if you have all the equipment and knowledege for doing it right, but you *can* just decide to mine Bitcoin if you know how and have the resources to do so.
@_date: 2018-09-28 13:11:10
Bisq is centralized, though.
Peer-to-peer means there is nothing in between the person buying and the person selling (or trading for products and services) other than the Bitcoin system itself.

@_date: 2018-09-22 19:04:13


On what public server?
There isn't one.


No one ever said anything of the sort.
The point is that anytime your ideas, feelings, perspective is censored, we all lose out, because you have a unique set of information about reality that no one else has access to.  You also have a lot of duplicate data, but that's beside the point.  We need to have access to your unique data, unconditionally, somewhere, so that we can learn about the universe in all it's multidimensional reality.  
I don't care of some private group wants to be ignorant of certain parts of reality (we can't all know everything :-).  But I do care if there is no space at all for you to share your data.
Right now that doesn't exist.  There are no free, fully public (no discrimination allowed) internet servers out there.  And public internet is rare as well.  A few municipalities have it at a few locations, at best.  This makes us all far more ignorant than we want to be.

Except that they specifically said that you get paid in Bitcoins.
And most people don't pay that much for electricity.  At least not personally.  And if they are using a larger company's electricity, whoever is paying will be paying a bulk rate, probably.
And, of course, paying money now for Bitcoin is kinda the whole point of investing.  You buy it now, and hope that it will go up in value.  So even if someone was paying more in electricity to mine Bitcoin, it would be worth it for many, especially since buying Bitcoin outright can be impossible for some, due to various laws and requirements and such.

I do understand how it works.  One to one connections are far simpler than using a middleman.  And adding a second middleman, in the form of a payment processor, in addition to the Bitcoin system, is clearly more complex.
It's fine if you want to add an extra layer of complexity, but just be aware that that's what you're doing, which is kinda going backwards, when we're talking Bitcoin.  The whole purpose of Bitcoin is to use it instead of for-profit, complex, biased money handlers, and to mostly DIY the whole monetary system.

The 57% isn't accurate when measuring differences on a logarithmic scale.
We're really at more like 97% there right now.
(EDIT, or maybe more like 88% there now, if I'm doing the logarithm math right, where a linear 57% is 88% on a log (base 100) scale.)
(EDIT II I was going backwards (like the original), so I needed to use 43% not 57%, so we're actually at about 82% there now.)

The consensus IS evolution. :-)
We take the stuff that we have now, break it apart, and then recombine the best parts together to form something better, while discarding the less useful stuff.
Bitcoin will be taken apart eventually and the parts will go their separate ways.  The robust and global blockchain network will be combined with a global resource sharing database, and the Monopoly game of competing for points (money) will die out as a meme that's as anti-social as the dinosaurs.
Thus we will evolve to be a collaborative, creative species, instead of a competitive, destructive one like we mostly are now.

I think you are confused about what permission means.
If you have to go through a middleman process, then you're not free to do what you want.  You have to get their permission.  It doesn't matter whether they reject you or not, you still have to get their permission.  Without the miners/nodes' permission, you don't get to make a transaction on the ledger.  Period.
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:56:28
Ideally, you do this peer-to-peer, with you asking friends and neighbors and other folks in your physical area if they'd be willing to trade.
Also look to see if your area has a local Bitcoin meetup or group.  People will trade there, too.  Do a web search for "Bitcoin (your town)"  Or whatever.  See what pops up.
Normally if you want to do a trade with someone peer-to-peer online, you'd want to have a reputation, with some well established social media account where folks know you and what you're like, in general.  That way folks will feel more comfortable trading with you since they can see that you're a normal human being, not some scammer, or whatever.

That's capitalism right there.  Trying to gatekeep the power/resources.
The actual way to move beyond capitalism and it's motivation towards hoarding and anti-social behavior is to stop feeding the hoarders and anti-social types, and start feeding ourselves, freely.  We can invest our own resources, whatever they are, materials, skills, passion, time, etc., on taking good care of ourselves.
The giant dinosaurs that are the corporations and banks will slowly wither away, due to starvation.  They will kick and scream now and then, but we can simply invite the humans that are hiding inside the T-rex costumes to join us and give them good things to make them feel welcome in the new world.

No.  If it's in my name it can easily be taken from everyone if I get sued, or otherwise have problems with the courts/government.  
A trust prevents that pretty well.  It's just got to be done right.  Which I'll figure out how to do when the time comes.  It's been a decade that I've been trying to get property that I could legally live on, so that's my number one priority.  When I actually get some, which seems like it could be soon, then I can focus on inviting people to help make it physically a reality, and then we can look into the legal shit for making it more protected.

Hey, I have a suggestion.
Can you put the percentage in exponential terms, instead of linear, to reflect the nature of the prediction's logarithmic growth, and help people see how close it actually is to the prediction?

How is Bitcoin not centrally issued?  There is a central set of rules/governance.  Bitcoin is designed by Satoshi, and maintained by the developers and miners, and to some extent the users.  They are the central authority defining what Bitcoin is and how it works.
If it were decentralized, you could make up your own rules for how to use it.  There is no way to make a decentralized currency, really.
What can be decentralized is the labor.  Anyone can be a dev or miner.

As a homeless woman, and also poor even when housed, I can say that the number one thing that is really hard to get from food pantries (and just buying it outright) is raw nuts/seeds.  
They are super dense, nutritionally, and are delicious, easy to carry, and can often even be sprouted and even grown into edible microgreens and even full on plants if you have garden space.
Fruit is super easy to get from food pantries and such, as grocery stores donate their older, and slightly damaged produce.

We have.  I don't know why that's not obvious.  We're almost exactly on the exponential line, which is where we should be to reach $1 million at the end of 2020.  It doesn't double every year.  (No one ever said that.) It goes up by a power of 10 every 15-16 months.
And remember that natural growth is never a perfect line, not even an exponential one.  It's a wobbly wavy wiggly thing that moves *around* a growth line.  It goes well above and well below that line.  But *on average* stays on it.  We we're hugely above it last fall and now we're a bit below it.  But we're absolutely exactly on track for something around base 10 exponential growth for the beginning of Bitcoin's adoption.
Also remember that we're measuring against something else that's going down (US$), in it's own wobbly way.  So we're not technically measuring Bitcoin adoption here, but it's adoption relative to US dollar value.

When I created a currency to use with my husband to trade for favors, I called it "honey money".

Communism doesn't really abolish private property, it merely removes the hoarding of unused and underused property.  In other words if you don't need it, for your work and your health, you don't get to claim it for yourself while denying others the things they need.
You get to have your own home, garden, books, computers, phone, etc.
Ultimately Marx was describing a healthy natural organic system where everyone is free to do whatever they want (creating, exploring, and sharing cool stuff) while getting what they need to do that work well, for free, even if he didn't realize it.  This is the most free system in existence in the universe, and has been proven to be the most effective one as well.

You're funny.  I still can't tell if you're trolling or just ignorant.
Ok, so if you don't need permission from any third party, you can just make up some amount of Bitcoin, independently, and give it to me, without anyone else checking to see if the Bitcoin wallet yoyu claim to be sending it from actually has that amount, and without anyone else checking to see that you're deducting the amount from the wallet you say you are using to send it.
Because that's not gonna happen.  That's kind of the whole point of Bitcoin, that you absolutely have to get every bit of ledger action checked by multiple individuals/groups, so that the accounts are as accurate as possible, and *only* the amounts that the centralized rules allow to be created and spent are created and spent.
Now, you *could* make up a totally different currency, whenever you want.  You could even call it "Bitcoin" and maybe get away with it (like Bitcoin Cash sometimes does).  But that's not actually Bitcoin.  So if you aren't getting permission from the centralized system of Bitcoin, you're not actually using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:26:18
So, you're saying that anyone who wants to, and has the resources, can just make up a transaction on their own, and give someone else money without anyone else checking to see if they have the money to give?

. Bail is voluntary (at least every place I've ever heard of it), and if you can't pay, you stay in jail until your court date.

Currencies are an arbitrary number score in some mutually agreed upon (made up) competitive game.  They are inherently useless (except possibly as a physical material, as in metal or paper).  They are symbolic representations of value, not value in and of themselves.

And yes, it has been well designed, but nothing is perfect.
It's the big beta test of the blockchain.  There's a huge incentive to hack Bitcoin, and a huge incentive to make it as  bulletproof and efficient as possible, so it's a great test of the system.
It only needs to hold out until we can get rid of the whole competitive approach to life as a basic meme, and then we can really have at it, and find it's weakness, and then use that finding to start a blockchain that actually does something good for everyone, keeping track of freely available resources so that they can be directed to the public whenever and wherever they are needed, easily and efficiently.

Just FYI Bitcoin, as well as all other currencies, are not decentralized in any meaningful way.  Control/governance/rule-making about the currency is always centralized in some important way.
What Bitcoin is is decentralized in how the central control group is chosen.  Anyone with the resources can be a potentially governing power, as long as their ideas coincide with the majority's ideas.  (Bitcoin is now mostly a democracy, though it was started by a single entity (an individual human or small group of humans).)
A truly decentralized system would be where everyone had their own rules for how things were generated and used.  For example, in the art world, anyone can create artwork, in using whatever process they like, and do whatever they want with it (sell it, trade it, give it away, copy it, etc.).

Um... I don't think you understand how cryptocurrencies work.  For them to function, they have to have rules governing how to create them and allocate them.  It's not like they just pop up randomly and change randomly, without anyone directing their functionality.

There is no universal way to choose, because what is important to you will be different and lead to different solutions.

I should add that almost everyone in this shelter has money, and most have jobs.  It's just that there aren't enough places to live, and the rents are insanely high, due to greed and competition.  And if you're at all weird, which many of us are, you don't get picked by paranoid landlords, because they can simply choose one of the more boring, stable folks to rent to.

Yes, it will be more of a challenge, but I believe it will be worth it.

Nature.  As always.
Life is designed, by DNA, to create, explore, and share awesome stuff that increases the fitness of life as a whole for future generations.  This is evolution.  
Only humans have managed to create memes (the evolutionary meaning of the term) that can temporarily infect societies with beliefs that are totally ass backwards, such as free individuals will just sit there bored to death, accomplishing nothing at all in life, if we don't force them into slavery in some way.
Nature programs all life with a reward system for problem solving and innovating, with humans at the peak of the system where art and science are what we absolutely love to do, and will do all the time if we are free to do so.  There's a reason the Age of Enlightenment, where some folks were free from forced labor, was such a peak time of our human history when it comes to technology and culture.

I understand that the starting point/price of Bitcoin is somewhat fuzzy.  
But it seems like it's not relevant for comparing current measurements.  You just need to calculate the difference between the current price and the current predicted price, just do it exponentially, rather than linearly.  (*Maybe* you just need to do the log of the percentage difference.  But I feel like there is something missing from that.)
The way I see it is like how if we're growing exponentially from 0 to 10, and we are at 5 right now, that is not 50% less than 10, but is only about 30% less than 10, logarithmically.  That's because log(10)2 = .301.

Most of the explanations here are intended to confused you.  They are overly useless and filled with acronyms that are meaningless.
The real answers are:
1. No one, really.  The mathematical problems are just calculations that verify that the correct Bitcoin account (wallet) is being used and that the amount being sent is actually available in their account.
2. They only get more complex because there are more people using Bitcoin, so there are more things to check.
3. Yes.  This is a democracy and the rules can change at any time.  But those who are in at the beginning, and have a lot of Bitcoin points already collected in the game that they want to protect don't want newbies coming in and making those older points less valuable by making more of them.  This is called inflation, and it's what many national currencies have problems with, so Bitcoin was specifically designed to not have that problem.  But if enough newbies show up, it could easily happen.

You could even own the company, and choose to mine as a way to make good use of your computers and internet.  And larger places aren't all employers.  You could be at a library, for example.  Which gets free internet though a government program probably (and usually uses way less than the government is paying for, in my experience).  Or you could be in a large cooperative apartment and getting cheap, or even free solar power.  There are many reasons why electricity might be cheap or essentially free.

It means that no matter who you are, no matter where you are, no matter when you are, something that is inherently X always has the quality of X.

I think you can answer this for yourself.  But in case you really are confused, the physical materials that the coins are made of have real value as materials.  I can open my bike light with a coin, as it works as a sort of screwdriver/lever.  The arbitrary number and name on the coin has nothing to do with that real value though.  It could be 1₿, 1¢, or 1¥ and it would still do the same work.
For a value to not be delusional/illusional, that value (ability to do some kind of work) it has to have objective value, not subjective.

The term "permissionless" when applied to Bitcoin simply means that anyone with the technology required and the interest can join the centralized system of governance for policing the ledger, as opposed to having some kind of vetting system where there are elections or appointments of candidates.  
Basically the "decentralized" and "permissionless" bit ONLY applies to who gets to become part of the government.  It's all volunteer, as opposed to something like Facebook, or Amazon, where the individuals who do the work making sure that everyone is following the rules are hired by those who already work there, and as opposed to something like UK parliament, where users of the system vote to elect the rule creators/enforcers.
But outside of who gets to make/enforce the rules, all of these systems are centralized and require that users get permission for anything they want to do in the system.  If a user wants to do something not permitted by the central authority, they either can't do it at all, or if they can, they get booted out of the system.

I would say that that's not inherent.  That's subjective value.
Does a cat, or a human living on another planet, care about the idea that "it is expensive to introduce newly mined bitcoins and the limited protocol"?  Nope.  A tree, on the other hand, is inherently useful to anyone, anywhere, in that it makes 
It's certainly a potentially useful strategy in a particular game system (money), but it's not inherently useful as it's just a game.
What *is* possibly useful, maybe not inherently, but at least more generally, is the idea of a distributed database system that keeps track of the location of items in a fairly error-resistant way.  In cases where our resources are naturally limited (by entropy), keeping track of where they are will be useful.  This is why blockchains are being used in shipping and warehouse situations already.

Well, it sort of does depend on the number of rules.  If there is only one rule that everyone has to obey then the system is centralized.  If everyone is free to use their own rules then it's decentralized.
In a decentralized system there is no enforcement.  Everyone is free.  Like in a human body with different sets of genes and expressions of them all working in the same body, doing their own thing.

Depends on what you mean by a communist.
I'm a scientist, myself, looking at systems growth and evolution, and seeing how complex things naturally grow when being governed by the rules of physics.  And that evolutionary growth pattern has things continuing to connect, while creating novel stuff (new technology, new ideas, new types of individuals, etc.) out of the older, more boring stuff.
Bitcoin is the old thing that will get taken apart to become something more interesting, which I see as a global database for keeping track of freely available resources so that they can flow easily from where they are overabundant to where they are underabundant, so that everyone can get what they need to function as well as possible, so that we can solve our problems most effectively, just like how our own bodies work, with each individual being free to do the work that we naturally want to do (following their dreams, as programmed by evolution), and so that we get the resources that we need to do that work well, and evolution can thus happen most effectively.

Technically Bitcoin isn't decentralized in the important way (it's still controlled by a central authority/rule, it's just that that authority is open to anyone who wants to join and has the resources to do it, unlike in a mainstream bank).
But the real difference that we're sort of losing out on when we use middlemen exchanges is the peer-to-peer transactions.  Any exchange will naturally remove the peer-to-peer element of Bitcoin.  So really what we ideally want to do is to trade with people we already know or at least get to know reasonably well.

Freedom is the goal of Communism.  If you don't want to be free, then, sure, you might not like it.
"A communist society would free individuals from long working hours by first automating production to an extent that the average length of the working day is reduced[13] and second by eliminating the exploitation inherent in the division between workers and owners. A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one's life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of freedom." As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered "true richness" to be the amount of time one has at his disposal to pursue one's creative passions.[14][15] Marx's notion of communism is in this way radically individualistic.[16]"

The FED is totally capitalism:






The problem that you are thinking about with the FED in the US is that it has a monopoly, which is the peak of capitalism.  In capitalism money begets money, and money is power, so the more money you have the more power you have in an ever increasing proportion.
Only in a decentralized, collaborative, free economic system do you get diverse kinds of stuff, since the motivation is to enjoy life instead of trying to collect more points than others.

Centralized systems have centralized rules, which is what Bitcoin has.  Decentralized systems, like human bodies, have lots of different rules that make the whole system as an emergent process from the bottom up, with each individual doing their own thing and an overall pattern showing up unexpectedly, rather than as a planned and forced pattern, as in either a democracy or any other centralized rule system.
I know that you probably weren't taught this in school, so I'm not surprised when folks get confused about decentralized systems.  But it's unfortunate.

Interesting discussion.  Not as silly as it sounds at first.
I think there is still something crucial missing here, though. 
Life, to me, is all about changing things.  Which is, as the author says, part of the random mutation process.  Life takes in matter and/or energy and processes it in some innovative way to generate something entirely new.  Life has a goal of growing, not preserving things exactly the same.  Bitcoin's code is primarily about preserving Bitcoin (the quantitative value/volume of the currency).  It's like a photocopier, taking in information and outputting the same information.
Now the point about generating new code, in the form of forks like Bitcoin Cash, is an interesting one.  But that could be said about any open source software.  And even closed source software, really, since current computer languages are very limited and a particular software code can often be easily reproduced even without actually knowing the original.  (Hence copyright laws when there is a competitive environment.)
I think what it really comes down to is that the code/software itself is not self-functioning.  It's an extension of human efforts.  No humans = no Bitcoin (or any other computer software).  Perhaps this is a fetal stage of a new lifeform, though, where computer software can indeed run itself independently from humans, and reproduce new computer software that can run in diverse environments outside of the specific operating systems of human computers.

It's not.  Or at least not in most ways.  Bitcoin is decentralized only in the respect that the members (coders, miners, buyers) come from the bottom-up, rather than being selected in some centralized process (hired, elected, appointed, born into it).
Everything else is centralized.  It's more democratic in it's centralization than, say, Facebook.

Excellent!  And intelligent people would want it more than other artificial systems, at least.  (Personally I choose to live the more natural, evolutionarily designed economy of matter and energy inputs and outputs that are internally motivated, so I don't really care about symbolic, quantitative systems very much, but for those who do, clearly one that is realistic and rational, based on real resources and how they work (losing value over time, due to normal wear and tear combined with other processes of degradation such as modernization and so on), is clearly a better way to go if you want a healthy system.)

The only kind of system shown to work over the entire history of life on Earth is a free, healthy one, which is where every individual has access to the things they need to do the work they naturally want to do, and where resources flow freely from where they are overabundant to where they are underabundant.
You can think that this is impossible, but life shows that it's very clearly possible.  Your body works this way.  Unless you're a bot.  I don't think you're a bot.

Well, again you do need permission to do anything with Bitcoin on the ledger.  And I think that people keep getting the wrong impression when folks talk about Bitcoin being that different from other currencies.  
Yes, it has some differences, specifically being kept accurate by using very aggressive rules/permissions that use lots of double checking processes to keep things from being too manipulated/hacked, and the rules are controlled by a group of global volunteers rather than people who are elected or hired, but otherwise Bitcoin is still very much a project that is very controlled and limited to those who follow the rules.

Um.  That's silly.  Of course you can trade Bitcoin wallets without the internet or even a computer.  Obviously someone, at some point, has to buy the Bitcoin and create a wallet.  But once it's created, it's really just some simple data (the keys), which can be traded.
It's not terribly secure, obviously, to have multiple people who could easily copy the private key.  But in a group of individuals who generally know one another and have reasonable bonds, it's fine, in the same way that giving your car or house key to your neighbor, in case of emergency, or to feed the cat, is reasonable.
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:11:00
Perhaps that's what not so intelligent people think!
Also, simple game theory is not reality.  Nature (which includes humans) don't work that stupidly.  Nature works more complexly, and includes a general (if not conscious) knowledge that the health of one's environment has a direct effect on one's own health, so it behooves us all (and we, again, know this at least instinctively, if not "intellectually") to take excellent care of our whole, collective group (the planet and all its flora and fauna and other forms of Earthlings).  In other words, realistic game theory includes cooperation as the highest reward option.

You clearly don't understand how a centralized democratic system works.  Which is what Bitcoin is.  A majority can vote to make changes and the minority doesn't get to have a say.  Any time there is the ability of one individual or group to tell others what the rules are, it's centralized.

Well, surely there is no way to escape entropy, as far as we know. :-)  But we still prefer the "realness" of natural things to the fakeness of artificial things, which you can see by looking at all the sorts of things that are synthetic which we might use occasionally (twinkies, powdered creamer, photos of sunsets) but which we pretty much always discard when a more natural/real version is available (home made cake, fresh cream, real sunsets).  We like the fact that things decay, because that makes us feel more "right" given our genetic preference for diversity, variety, and healthy things.  We almost never need to be "talked into sticking to the rot" because we're born to love the rot.  Literally.  Without the rot, our lives would be dull and boring and mundane and beautiless.

It's bad because people tend to hoard, thus creating a huge inequality with almost no money circulating, meaning most people become impoverished, eventually.  Think about your body, if your heart held on to your blood, because it was "too valuable" to spend, you'd be dead within a short time.  The same is true for valuable resources in the world, they need to be circulated, so that they get to where they are needed and can be made into more useful things for everyone.
It's true that much of the stuff that gets bought these days is harmful to the planet and everyone on it, but that's a symptom of ignorance and profiteering based on rampant competition and... hoarding as policy.  Once your symbolic resources (such as money) start depreciating naturally, the way real resources do (due to entropy), people stop hoarding and start investing their resources in their communities and friends and family and so on, which gives everyone a chance to be involved in doing more valuable work, rather than being forced into wage slavery to make crap for a sick corporate system.  With depreciation built into the economy, representing the way real systems work, we can finally function the way we're designed, which is to do interesting, meaningful stuff the way nearly all humans feel inherently directed to do.

It totally doesn't need to be mandatory.  That's exemplified in the fact that we already do most of our exchanges with the world using resources that lose value.  That's called nature.  Every time we grow our own food from seeds, we know that seeds die after a few years, usually, so we know to plant them or give them away pretty quickly, rather than hording them.  We could choose to make synthetic food (so growing food isn't mandatory), but we prefer to use the more natural option, and are totally ok with the rapid decrease in value of our materials.

The tendency to hoard is an illness which not only deprives others of things they need or at least could otherwise use to do something beneficial to an individual, and it forces the hoarding individual to waste resources trying to contain and defend their excess.   
Do you normally carry around all your poop with you, because it's yours and it's valuable (high in the nutrients that fuel plant growth)?

It's not a joke, [it's a geographical preference]( similar to people saying pop vs soda (as an abbreviation of sodapop).
On accident vs on purpose is sensible.  Though I personally agree that it sounds really weird to do something on accident.  I would say I did something accidentally, like I would do something purposefully.  But we also say we do something on purpose.  So why not do something on accident?  Life is weird.  Words describing life are even weirder, I guess.

Well, I think you're ignoring a lot of the real people investing in Bitcoin.
And all currencies are indeed ponzi schemes.  A ponzi scheme is where the original creators/owners/whatever of something increase the value of that thing by getting others to accept that it's even more valuable than it is.  The more people believe that the thing is more valuable than it really is, the more valuable it (temporarily) becomes.
No currency is "backed by anything".  It's all irrational, unnatural, and arbitrary.  It's all just a religion, really, whether were talking about government/corporate currencies, cybercurrencies, Animal Crossing bells, or Gucci bags.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:40:29


I'm not sure what you're referring to?  There is no deflation in Bitcoin right now, as far as I know.  Value can go up any time, and does (insanely) so right now it makes sense to hoard Bitcoin (or at least it did for those who got in early), which makes for a broken economy that can't flow.
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:19:01
I'm not "trying to support a theory" though.  I'm talking about the reality that there is a factual incentive to hoard if value can go up in a resource (real or imaginary).
Also, I'm not talking about a theory, I'm talking about how reality works, with resources being subject to entropy, which isn't a theory, but a law.  Any symbolic system that tries to represent real resources with numbers is going to have to obey the laws of physics, or it will fail.
It's absolutely true that the world doesn't have infinite resources, which is pretty much my point here.  Any symbolic resource (a "metaphorical value" system) where value can go up, when resources themselves don't go up, is irrational.
Wasteful production is the symptom of hoarding.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:50:43
Actually, it's not at all a theory, it's the way every system in the real world works.  It's called entropy. :-)  A system with a symbolic version of resource value that doesn't include devaluation over time is inherently backwards and anti-science and born to break any group who use it.  Which is why we have such a broken economy right now.
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:49:21
A fully natural economy.  The way evolution intends it to be, even on a global scale.
Think about how your body works and all it's individual cells (human and otherwise) being independent, yet being supported by, and supporting, a larger system/organism.  All of the parts are free to do what they want (following their dreams for creating and exploring the best stuff available, as they see it) and all the parts are helped in getting whatever resources they need to function well, while the whole lot of them creates a healthy, collaborative organism that can accomplish a hell of a lot more than the individuals ever could have on their own.
That collaborative AND free (so the best of both "Communism" AND a "free market" without the worst of either) system is how our planet is starting to move towards.  We need the global nervous system and circulatory systems that the internet and global shipping/transportation infrastructures are becoming for this to really work, though.  So we've still got a little ways to go, before the whole planet is up and running as a connected system.  There are still major areas and large swaths of Earthlings (animal, vegetable, mineral, etc.) that aren't even a little connected to the whole, let alone well connected, so we still have to do this competitive thing for a bit.  Which is why I don't have many qualms in taking money from others in the form of investing in Bitcoin.  For me, the whole Monopoly game is coming to an end.  And I'm looking to use any points I gain right now to improve the world for everyone, by dumping any winnings I get l into a non-profit project I've wanted to do for a long time.

And yes, I agree.  Money is the current way to get things that you don't already have.  In the future, that's unlikely to be how we go about taking care of ourselves.  So use it while you've got it to improve the world in whatever way makes sense to you.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:56:08
I don't know that much about the details, but most people I've heard who have Bitcoin are hoarding it, because they want to see what happens to it's value.  That's broken, as in without flow, there is no economy, and is instead just a pile of numbers, sitting somewhere, being useless.

If you want high quality information, you have to seek out the personal stories of what people want, and what they have experienced in life.  Subjective, first person information is the only thing that's even close to the "truth", because most people's instincts are to want to be known and be understood.  On the other hand, anything purporting to be "objective" is, at best, third hand rumor, and at worst political manipulation.  We don't need to totally discount "objective" information, but it's certainly not something you want to think of as a reliable source.

Any time you set up a game that is life or death, and you use competition amongst the players, as in our current society/government, you get aggressive/antagonistic attacks on the players, almost guaranteed.  It's called tit-for-tat.

This is why we need to get away form a society/government that is competitive, especially when it comes to basic needs (food, shelter, education, and freedom of expression).  When people are forced to compete against one another just to have a reasonably healthy life end up harming one another out of desperation and/or confusion.  Unconditional Basic Income could be a temporary solution, but the long term solution is a change in our whole approach to how we choose to invest our time and resources, so that we're actually focused on solving our shared problems, rather than collecting $, £, ¥, BTC, points etc.)

Funny... I keep saying how much better Reddit is getting, with more diversity, and more collaborative problem solving.
I think the difference might be in which communities you're looking at.  The "popular" communities have indeed gotten lamer, with mods taking huge power trips, and decreasing diversity, and repressing new and interesting ideas.  I unsubbed from nearly all of those communities years ago.  (I still read even though it is vastly shittier than it was before it became a default, because it's still better than anything else I've seen here for news and discussion on innovation.)  The good stuff, as it nearly always is, is in the leading edge of the bell curve, far away from the middling, average, masses.  The weird communities are the best.

In reality, though, it's always better to collaborate, both short and long term, since both are necessary for survival.  Which is why almost no animal species, including humans, cheat regularly.  It's just not statistically useful.  Only in emergency situations...  But our "modern" culture promotes, as Joseph Geobbels (I think) knew, the idea that we're constantly under threat.  So it's no surprise that so many humans in "civilized" society think it's necessary to cheat as much as possible these days.  But it goes against our very nature, and that's why we're always so miserable and physically ill.  We're literally self harming as a society.  Instead of prioritizing ourselves (which is good for everyone), we sacrifice ourselves to profits and illness and fear as a social norm, all in the service of hoarding more money.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:38:00
I'd also add that another way to think about systems is that they can be either top-down/forced/artificial, or bottom-up/emergent/natural.  Evolution supports (creates, really) the latter, while fighting against the former.  This is why cultures, languages, and other complex systems that last in a variety of diverse environments/time-periods are the systems that are emergent: created by all if the different individuals and spreading through the system interdependently, with the ones that are most useful being taken up by the largest proportion, but with a long tail of adoption as well, for the niche individuals/environment.
(This is very different from democracy, which is essentially mob-rule, with no diversity allowed, and top-down control being governed by the majority vote, rather than each individual being free to create and use whatever approach they find most useful, resulting in a parallel set of functions/approaches being used at any given time.)
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:11:23
Think of Bitcoin like any other practical fad — something that is useful in current society, but not something that is inherently useful, thus making it susceptible to abandonment when something better comes along — like how CD players and SUVs came and went.  At first, only a few people want it, but those who have it are happy.  Then, as people see how happy those who have it are, the demand for it will naturally go up at a very rapid pace.  But then there will be other things that are much better, and so the demand will fall back down, possibly dramatically, or maybe with a slow decline.
Right now we're just starting to see mainstream demand for Bitcoin.  So it's starting to shoot up in popularity (and value since with Bitcoin there is an excessively artificially restricted amount of it available, in contrast to things like CD players).  Right now is a very reasonably good time to buy in.  It is certainly better to buy in now than wait until everyone who might want some already has some.  If your goal is to take other people's money.

The solution is to not have a centralized platform, but instead have individuals connecting to those they already know, or are at least curious about, in a decentralized network, using a standardized communication framework/format, **and** to primarily focus what is communicated on two things:
1. Questions about how to get from point A to B.  (With A and B being current conditions/states/resources in any form, and B being the goal condition/state/resources.)
2. Answers about how people have successfully gotten from point A to point B.

Shooting someone (or even considering it) is not defense, it's offense.
If someone is simply trying to take your money, then *defense*is to not have money on you, or to have it hidden.  Defense is a shield that prevents you from harm, not a weapon that harms others.
And if you don't feel like you can defend yourself without a gun, then maybe you should get some therapy.  Being afraid to even just walk around without a gun seems like you might have PTSD or something.

Better to invest that in two things:
1. A home for your kid.  The number one cause of depression, anxiety, anger, etc. is insecurity about one's home life, and having a home goes a long way towards getting at least some security of having a place where one belongs and can be oneself.
2. A healthy, resilient community for you and your family.  Increasing the ability of everyone in your community to be able to come together to solve shared problems goes an even longer way to helping people feel like they have a home and a place they belong.  Think: community gardens, community resource spaces, playgrounds, hacker spaces, libraries, community workshop spaces, community kitchens, etc, can all increase the resiliency and health of a community.

Not with that attitude.
They only way they have power is if it is given to them.  All your decisions about who and what you invest your resources in are feeding something.  What are you feeding?
I don't pay taxes for the most part.  And haven't for about a decade.  Legally.  I haven't worked for a company that harms anyone in a very long time.  And I haven't voted for any politician that I don't fully support.  And whenever possible I use my resources to invest in the most creative and productive and compassionate organizations and companies I can find.  I'm not perfect, but if I can mostly not support the projects and programs that I find dangerous, then so can you.  It's just a decision you make.  Rather than complaining and/or fighting while being otherwise generally comfortable in life, you can simply choose to redirect your life to be more in line with what your goals are, accepting that life might not be comfy, but will be better, in the long run.

Don't want your resources being used for things you think are harmful?  Then don't give your resources to those who are likely to use them in harmful ways, directly or indirectly.
Pay taxes?  Work for a company or individual that cons people into doing things that are harmful?  Buy products from companies or individuals who cause harm?

I think a lot of the animosity that males have for females, or just the idea of females pointing out their being female, is that mainstream media, education, government, parents, and even women have really confused the hell out of males.
Guys are given mixed messages: Men don't express emotions!  Men are supposed to be assholes to be successful!  Men should be sensitive and open!  Men should treat women as the fair sex!  Men should blah, blah, blah.  So men react with aggression when whatever they try to do as they are told and it fails to accomplish the promised goal.
Women get mixed messages too, of course, and women deal differently with confusion, being less naturally aggressive (due to less testosterone, usually).  Women tend to be more passive aggressive when their strategies fail.  Which obviously doesn't help anyone, either.

Everyone has wildly varying meanings for "decentralized", similar to "consciousness", or "good".  
Personally, I go with the most literal, systems theory, meaning of not having any sort of center of coordination that can be pointed to, be it a location on the planet, or a set of code.  If there is some shared, central node in the network, which all use as a guide for operation (such as Bitcoin's code for generating/maintaining the ledger, or the US constitution), then I call it centralized.
But I'm clearly in the minority.
Most folks seem to think anything with many different nodes is "decentralized".  Or something.  I really can never get a clear answer when I ask folks what they mean when they use the term.

Centralized: has shared rules that all users follow, or be kicked out of the system (or punished).  Good for stability and predictability.  Rules can be decided upon through any process from pure democracy or consensus to pure totalitarian governance, therefore control can be top-down, or bottom-up and top-down combined.
Decentralized: no rules!  Chaos! Everyone does what they want, and sometimes emergent properties appear, but it's highly unpredictable from the initial conditions.  Good for evolution and adaptation and creativity.  Decisions are made entirely by individuals for their own behavior, and no one has control of anyone else, therefore control is only ever bottom-up.
Basically if it's a free for all, it's decentralized, like art.  And if there are shared rules applied to all, it's centralized.
At least if we're talking logic and systems theory (governance).

Not in any meaningful/literal way.
Bitcoin has central rules which completely regulate how it's generated and allocated.  The ledger records all transactions, centrally.  Bitcoin is, actually, about as centralized as a currency can get, which is why it's so reliable and "secure" from variation.  It's really hard to change the rules of Bitcoin.
National currencies are also centralized, with regulatory rules, and centralized records that keep track of where everything is.  (Actual dollar bills, and other paper/metal money is more decentralized in it's record keeping, of course, but there isn't a lot of that these days, with most money being virtual/computer-based.)
Most currencies, including Bitcoin and US$, are, these days, distributed, in both the regulatory process and the record keeping (with different branches of the government and banks doing part of the work).
What Bitcoin is, different from other currencies, is fully public, open source, and global.  **Anyone** who has the resources and interest can become involved in Bitcoin's governance and use, as opposed to needing to be elected, hired, or otherwise in some kind of power/influence position for them to have any sort of say in the governance of national currencies.

No one forces anyone to participate in a cult.
A cult is where *behaviors* are enforced, rather than merely recommended.
The authoritarians here enforce certain behaviors through punishment and control.
While healthy religions merely recommend that folks follow certain ideal behaviors, but don't actively enforce them.
Bitcoin as a currency does have some enforced rules, but they are open to change, as long as the community finds consensus on those changes.  A cult would not be open to such democratic change.

I think you're confusing a religion with a cult.
Currencies are a religion, uniting individuals into a belief that something is important to them, and using that unity to empower some ideology and/or set of rules for behavior.
A cult is a religion where deviance from the ideology/rules is promoted as being not just "not what we do" as in religions, but "dangerous" to the individual, and possibly even deadly.
I don't think anyone in the Bitcoin community, or the US$ community, or any other mainstream currency that is a shared ideology/rules claims that not using sad currency is a death sentence or even especially dangerous.  Though some might feel that having whatever the popular money happens to be in their circles is going to keep them from being homeless or starving or something, but that's not the official PR of the collective.  It's just ignorance in individuals.  Which is clearly different from a cult.

In national currencies as well as Bitcoin, there is some central set of rules.  How those rules are decided is usually some combination of democratic voting, and nominating/backing/electing/hiring "experts" to meritocratically make the decisions.  There are probably a few currencies that have just one totalitarian individual making the rules, but most national currencies, and Bitcoin, obviously, have rules created by many different individuals.
What Bitcoin is is public and global and open source.  But it's still fully centralized.  Moreso than most national currencies, as, again, this is what makes Bitcoin so reliable and secure, as compared to a system that can easily be changed.
A decentralized system, on the other hand, is where everyone just does what they want, chaotically, and the only shared behavior being unpredictable, random, emergent stuff.  Like we see in art.  Art is a decentralized system.  Currencies are centralized.

Instead of having to go through a middleman banking service or related payment processing service (like Paypal, or a credit card, or using a check or account transfer), I can simply send Bitcoin directly into your wallet.  If you add an entirely different party to the mix, between you and I, then that's a middleman.

The irony here is that Buckminster Fuller thought that money was a ridiculous concept to use for life:
"Think about the Great Depression. One day everything was going along fine - everybody was pretty wealthy and had plenty to eat - and the next day, suddenly, everybody was in poverty. What happened? Had the farms disappeared? Had the cows vanished into thin air? Had the fish of the sea ceased to exist? Had human beings lost their energy, their skills, and their brains? No. This is what happened: On the morning after the beginning of the Depression, a carpenter came to work, and the foreman said to him, 'Sorry, chum, you can't work today. There ain't no inches.'
The carpenter said, 'What do you mean, there ain't no inches?'
'Yeah,' the foreman said. 'We got lumber, we got metal, but we ain't got no inches.'
'You're crazy,' the carpenter said.
And the foreman replied, 'The trouble with you is you don't understand business. There are no inches. We have been using too many of them and not enough to go around.'
What happened in the Great Depression was that human beings confused money with wealth. And they didn't realize that money is a measure of wealth, in exactly the same way that inches are a measure of length. They think it is something that is valuable in and of itself. And as a result of that they get into unbelievable trouble."

GitHub is a centralized thing, yes.  That's my whole point.  It IS a gate-kept castle of centralized power.  That's what this post is reminding us of.
If we want to socialize/collaborate/share content in a robust and censorship free way, we need to decentralize the internet.  That means not having platforms, but having loose networks of individual servers hosting their own content, and sharing what they want to share, and with some effective ability to search/match content to interests easily.  That's probably far tougher than the mesh network need.  But it's definitely doable, even so.

There are no decentralized systems for currency.  It's not possible.  If it is "a" currency, it's gotta be centralized.  The governance can be democratically governed (like Bitcoin), or done some other way (like National currencies), though, which is where most folks find a big difference.
A truly decentralized system is more like art, where everyone just does things the way they want, and others decide what they think of it based on their personal preferences.
If it's quantitative, it's centralized.  If it's qualitative, it's decentralized.
If you want to talk about Bitcoin, use the term democratic, or open-source, or distributed, perhaps.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.
This applies to platforms and exchanges as well as wallets.
Reddit has the keys.
r/bitcoin "mods" have the keys.
Github has the keys.
Coinbase, Robinhood, Square, Bisq, etc., have the keys.
In this case "the keys" refer to the website servers that host our content.
Peer to peer is supposed to be bottom-up, decentralized, not top down, centralized.
There should be no "repository".  Just a loose network of individuals, connected directly via personal websites/servers, ideally in a mesh network, or public/free internet providers, using rss-feed type subscription tools for discussing and sharing things as a group, and maybe bittorrent style up/downloading of software.
If the goal is to have a global, democratic, meritocratic, (and only a little plutocratic) open-source ideal for maintaining and using Bitcoin, and other movements away from privatized/nationalized (highly plutocratic) systems, then we have to move away from tools we don't have full, free, equal, censorship free access to.

Even with Trezor being open source, it's still a for-profit company, and sold by third and fourth parties as well, who obviously don't allow the public to make decisions.
So, the concern is everyone being able to access both the connections for interacting with one another for working on a project like developing/maintaining Bitcoin code, and, obviously, for sharing the official versions.  When we let centralized companies and governments make decisions, and especially ones that make us give them money, then we lose control and that's not what Bitcoin is about.

Those percentages are linear, rather than exponential, which is how growth is measured.
We're AT about 78% (only 22% down) of the prediction line for one million in a bit over a year, if you measure exponentially.  And that's well within the norm for natural variation as things grow in a wobbly pattern (not linear).

The whole meme of life as a quantitative point scoring competitive game (money, grades, votes, etc.) will finally go extinct as it's the dinosaur of ideologies (anti-social, wasteful, dumb, etc.).
We're about to finally realize that we can take excellent care of ourselves when we are free.  Free to do what we love, and free to take what we need from available resources (the public pool of shared creations and understanding).
The planet will finally become a fully functioning newborn organism in the galaxy, with a fully connected nervous system and circulatory system that allows matter and energy resources to flow freely from where they are naturally produced to where they are useful or needed, just like in our own animal bodies.
Evolution makes us specialized so that we naturally want to do the niche work that needs to be done for life to flourish and expand into the universe, and we just need to stop being infected with the meme that makes us go against our own natural instincts of creating, exploring, and sharing the most awesome stuff in life.

If there is "an exchange" service, then the service itself is a middleman, logically, being a center which has to be gone through before my money can get to you.
A direct peer-to-peer transaction is just me sending you money, without anyone else having any say in the matter.
Some folks want the "security" of a middleman, keeping an eye on the transaction, to make sure that both parties are happy.  And some folks want the convenience of having a third party find peers to trade with.  That's fine.  Just know that the third party, centralized, approach has it's drawbacks as well as it's benefits.

Yes, Bitcoin, as is any currency, a centralized system.  Unlike, say, art, where everyone just does whatever they want, chaotically.
But the point of Bitcoin is that its central rules are open source and fully controlled by the public, and treats all individual users equally.  There is no chance for being scammed or being discriminated against due to bias when using Bitcoin directly.  While there is a chance at that if you involve a third party in the transaction, as in the case of an exchange, especially one with an arbitrator function.

Not in the least.  By the definitions that systems theorists use, almost all natural systems are decentralized.  Only artificial systems are centralized.
A centralized system is one where everyone has shared rules, and so control is... get this... centralized.
When a system, such as our animal bodies, or art, is decentralized, then everyone has their own rules, and no one individual or set of rules controls anyone else.  Each individual is free to do what they want, with the only restrictions being the natural laws of physics.
Another example is that a single currency is centralized, while the collection of currencies as a whole is decentralized.  (Though national governments and exchanges try to centralize currencies as much as possible, which is both useful and annoying depending on what your goals are.)

I seriously doubt that the letters can fall out.  What would be the point of going to all that design trouble to make a product that totally doesn't work?  Not that it doesn't happen.  But it seems pretty obvious that it would be designed to secure the letters once you put them in.
Though without the OP giving any sort of context here, I have no idea how this thing works.
**EDIT** I just looked at these things, especially the Cryptosteel one, and yes, there is a plate protecting them from falling out.  The tiles are in a frame, essentially, and you not only have to carefully unscrew a screw, but then you have to very specifically slide a bar around to open up the space, and then, it's still hard for the tiles to slide out of their spaces without putting some effort into it.

I think the logic of public announcements includes promoting the lottery, as in if you see a real person win it, it feels more likely that it could happen to you.

I don't think you understand what most humans make, monetarily, anywhere.
The average income of the bottom 90% of humans who earn a salary in the US alone is around $30,000 a year.  Add to that all of the humans who aren't getting a salary (retired, kids, teens, disabled, and just don't have a monetarily paid job), and it's significantly lower: about $15,000 on average.  (The ratio of employed to not-employed is about 1:1)  Also, for reference, the typical social security payment to those who get it is around $12,000 a year.  That's what the US Government thinks is a reasonable income for humans to live on.
A normal new car, according to Kelly Blue Book is about $37,000.  Obviously you don't pay that every year.  But also, if you don't pay the whole thing up front, you have to pay a ton in interest, and, of course, there is insurance, maintenance, gas, and parking costs.  The US Labor and Statistics tells me that the average cost of owning a car in the US is over $9000 a year.
The average yearly mortgage for a house in the USA is about $12,000 a year.
I'll let you to the math from here.

Bitcoin is centralized, governance-wise.  Just like all currencies.
In a centralized system, everyone has to follow the same rules, or be punished or kicked out of the system. This makes the system very safe and secure from unwanted changes.
What Bitcoin, and some other currencies (like US$) are, are *distributed*, and *open to the public* to participate in creating the rules, at least to some extent.
The most interesting thing about Bitcoin as being different from most, if not all, currencies is that it's global, and extremely meritocratic and democratic, and far less plutocratic in nature.  In other words, if you have the skills, you can contribute to making the rules, no matter who you are, or how much money/resources you have (beyond decent access to the internet), by becoming a developer, and being subject to pretty direct democratic voting on your proposals to the rules (code).  And also, of course, anyone who has at a certain level of money/resources can be a miner, and have an equal chance to earn some Bitcoin for running the software to support the maintenance of the ledger database.  This is probably also one of the most notable differences between Bitcoin and most other currencies, as it means the initial allocation of the currency is a bit more open to all, though it's still plutocratic and, meritocratic, to a large extent, as only those with enough money/resources and skill to get the mining-capable machines, and the electricity to run them enough to have a chance to earn the reward.
However, in my opinion, the most important concept that makes Bitcoin stand out is that it's a temporary, beta testing contest that is open to all to compete in making a global database for robustly keeping track of the location of things with the most energy efficient equipment, code, and power source.

The chart looks legit.  It's just that things slow down (relative to the growth line) *all the time* as part of the random fluctuations of a complex system.

It's still moving in that direction, and just fluctuation around that exponential line with normal variation as it does so.

Get a normal wallet as Gr33nHatt3R suggested, and then look to your personal communities to find people to trade with, either in person, maybe at a Bitcoin meetup in your area, or online with others who you know fairly well, and feel comfortable giving and receiving money from.
Or look to selling a product or service for Bitcoin as a way to make it directly.
Bitcoin was made to be peer-to-peer, not made to use middleman banks and other trading services.
Mining is indeed an option, but if you're using normal computers, it might not work out as well as you'd like.  Mining has become a huge profiteering business and they go all out with the fanciest, specially made, computers to do it.   Making it hard for everyone else to get into the game.

Entropy/evolution are the laws of nature, which, unless you're into the supernatural thing, are what govern all behaviors.  Especially incentives and self-interest.
We humans are social animals, and only acquiesce to competing against our family, friends, neighbors, and even total strangers under huge brainwashing campaigns by corporations and governments.  But we're finally starting to see that memetic natural selection and random mutation kick in and allow the small and furry memes to flourish as the dinosaur memes of "be big and greedy" go extinct due to the basic reality of energy conservation.  Small and collaborative simply has a higher fitness/entropy than large and competitive.  Creativity and curiosity are more resilient in a changing environment.  
If you read the quote I offered again, you'll see that no one pays for anything.  There are simply a few of us who are passionate about creating technology that does what humans need done but don't want to do for ourselves, so that everyone's finally free to be their best possible selves, creating and exploring to their heart's content, innovating and solving problems freely, as they appear, because that's what intelligent and philosophical brains are made, by evolution, to do, freely.  Our incentives are our greatest dreams of doing awesome stuff.  Money gets in the way of that, because it gives us fake "incentives" to do shitty stuff that harms the world most of the time.  Most of our resources are going to waste, at best, right now.  But that's changing.  Finally.  Evolution, even on a memetic level, is slow and thorough.  So those of us who can see how it works, and where we're headed, just have to wait for the rest of the thinking beings on the planet to catch up to us and follow our lead of doing what we love, for free, and having an awesome time doing it.

The sooner we in the Bitcoin community start using Bitcoin as it was designed, as a direct, peer-to-peer currency, rather than going through centralized exchanges (including things like Bisq, which act as a middleman for fascilitating exchanges), the better off we'll all be.
We need to start connecting to the people we already know in our communities, online and in meatspace, so that we can use Bitcoin for payments with our friends, family, local businesses, employees, and other folks we want to give and receive money from for any purpose (even exchanging different currencies).
As long as most Bitcoin goes through third parties, especially larger ones, governments and corporations will always, ultimately, be in control of it, not the people, collectively.

Also, I think you're confused about Bitcoin.  The central database is the only thing that matters, really, and that's the ledger.  Without this central record, the whole system is nothing.

If there is an exchange you're going through, it's not peer-to-peer.
Actual peer-to-peer would be me sending you Bitcoin straight to your wallet, and you sending me whatever other currency or good straight to me in some way (another crypto wallet, or a bank transfer, or handing me something in person, or sending it via email to my personal address).
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:57:04
They can't block Bitcoin.  There is no way to stop your wallet from sending or receiving Bitcoin from another wallet.
As long as you have internet access, you're good.
What you're really asking is where can you find people to trade with you.  And that is answered by thinking about how you might make new friends.  Find communities where you have shared interests and talk to people casually to get to know them, and when you find people you feel comfortable with, ask them if they'd like to trade anything for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-05 14:01:23

That has nothing to do with systems theory and the difference between centralized and decentralized systems.  
Centralized vs. decentralized has to do with whether or not there is a single, central set of rules that everyone must obey (if they are to use the system).  If everyone has their own rules for what they do and how they interact, then it's decentralized.  If there is a single agreed upon set of rules, usually aimed at providing "security" then it's a centralized system.

No thanks.  I'm looking for decentralization and freedom.  You can have capitalism with real resources: time, energy, curiosity, creativity, materials, and labor.

I wrote [this a while back on what Bitcoin is, in the grand scheme of the planet's past, present, and future](
As for your comment: 


I find that amusing, since Bitcoin is one of the most walled, rigid, hard to access things humans have created.
The only thing that's open about it at all is that the maintenance is done by public volunteers, rather than being run by some officials who were hired/elected. 


It does the opposite though.  Bitcoin makes humans go against their best interests by making them compete against one another for imaginary points (money), instead of collaborating, for meaningful, fun, projects, which is what we social animals' naturally have as our goal.  BUT!  As I say in that article I linked to, there is *some* collaboration here, which is where the fun is.  The blockchain is where we're having the fun, and doing meaningful work on beta testing a robust global database for keeping track of freely available resources.  Once the blockchain experiments are done, and it's ready to go out there for real, the whole competitive nature of it (money) will disappear, and fully serve all of life, not just a few.

@_date: 2019-11-16 14:02:22


That's competition if you demand X for doing Y.  Collaboration is sharing excess resources freely because it's logical (mathematically).  
I usually use the idea of breathing to explain this.  If you hold your breath and wait until you finding someone to trade your exhalation with, you're gonna die.  It makes no sense to hang onto resources you don't need, because it makes your life harder, and prevents you from getting what you do need (since excess resources takes up space).  So... you exhale, freely.  The same is true for all other resources in your life.
And, the cool thing is that evolution/entropy make sure to have diverse individuals who take in all of the different kinds of resources and output other, different resources, so that specialization can take care of everyone's needs, freely.  Not perfectly, obviously, but as efficiently as possible (see: the laws of conservation of energy).  So, we have trees to inhale our exhalations, and they exhale oxygen for us to inhale.  Freely.


I have no idea what this is all about.  Other than some weird rephrasing of my point about evolution being a slow process.  Certainly everyone dies before our dreams are fully complete.  This is what genetic and memetic evolution is all about, passing on the most effective strategies and patterns of code, and letting the less effective/efficient code (our personal genes and memes) die out.


I wasn't planning on doing so.  I presumed if you were interested in going into the field of systems growth, evolution, metaphysics, and such, you'd do that, rather than expect some random person on the internet to give you a summary of her past 30+ years of research in a Reddit post.


I never said it was bad.  I said that competition is mathematically inefficient, in the same way that a dinosaur was genetically inefficient, as compared to collaboration.


Yes, that's obvious.  And wasteful.  Keeping score in an artificial, irrational, competitive game wastes everyone's time and energy and resources, compared to the natural, healthy approach of inhaling and exhaling freely, and letting natural diversity and specialization take over control of the flourishing of the ecosystem.


It's hard.  But what can you do?  We're getting there.  I see it happening, and I'm making progress on helping others evolve as well.  So that makes life feel quite positive.

It does.  There is a security deposit and escrow.  It might be temporarily owned/held by more than one individual, with a complex way of keeping it away from any one person or company, but the money isn't just peer-to-peer.  There is a central system that it has to go through and be held by.

If you have money left over after basic needs, some would say you're rich.
Also, for comparison, the average yearly income (adjusted for local variations in cost of living) is about $4500.  A year.

Again, if it is an exchange, it is literally a central function/platform *between* two peers.  
What you are probably thinking about is either an open source or maybe a volunteer-run exchange/system/platform.
A decentralized system is one where individuals are just interacting with one another directly, as when I give you an apple, in person, and you give someone else a drawing of that apple, and they give someone else a poem about an apple, and so on.

Bitcoin is ideal for larger purchases, or for totally online stuff (like VPN services or donations to online content creators).
The middling stuff is kind of a waste to involve Bitcoin with, since the people selling stuff want to use that money quickly on other middling stuff that they need (food, clothes, bills, etc.).
Also, Bitcoin is supposed to be peer-to-peer, not involving some centralized middleman service like a website or app.

No centralized system can serve the needs of a project/idea that needs to be free to evolve and with that the need for everyone to have equal access.
If someone else has control over the servers that everyone goes to to share content, then they have almost all the power.  If they turn their servers off, or decide to block, ban, censor, etc., any individual, group, or subject, then it's authoritarian.
Which is not what our goal is, right?
Bitcoin, and the internet in general, needs to become public and decentralized.  And by that I mean everyone has free access to their own server, on their own person, in their own home, or at least in their own community space, where they have unconditional access.  Then servers can connect directly to one another, as the web was designed to do.  Not via service providers, not through media platforms.  But server to server, making a literal web of information (electricity) flowing around the planet.

Heath bar crunch? :P
And health is EVERYTHING about your functionality.  There is nothing that you do that isn't governed by how well your body is able to get your needs met to function.  Unless you believe in supernatural forces/souls or something outside of your body, of course.  (In which case there kinda isn't any use in trying to understand life, as it's got an unknowable element to it.)


That would not be healthy for anyone.  Unless you're in a coma and can't function otherwise, but even that's just life support.  Not health.


Lol.  So why are you talking to me here?  Are you saying you're getting paid?  Why do you exhale?  Did someone pay you to give away your carbon dioxide?  Or your urine, sweat, poop?  Do you just want to sit inside a hole for the rest of your life and never do anything creative or interesting?  
Because, again, I don't believe you.
Capitalism at it's heart is just a way to invest in a group.  It can be in Communism (full freedom), socialism (public corporations making money), or centralization as we have now, with private corporations their governments telling everyone what they can and can't do, and hoarding the resources as much as possible without destroying too many humans (or their favorite other people, places, and things). 
Real solutions come from everyone following their dreams (as evolution programs us) for creating, exploring, and sharing awesome stuff that makes us feel happy to be alive.  For that to happen, we need to be free, rather than forced to serve the monetary Monopoly game of keeping score and hoarding resources we don't want/need.
Capitalism can be used in a centralized or decentralized system.  It is, as I've said, literally just investing capital in some project.  It's not a form of governance.
If you are in favor of private corporations hoarding resources, and forcing individuals to compete for money/points (Bitcoin or whatever) just to live, then you're the one promoting centralization.  (Everyone else is confused about Bitcoin not seeing how it's highly centralized.  Which is unfortunate.)
Decentralization is where we're free.  This is Communism, as Marx and Engles spoke of.  We do what we want.  We inhale, exhale, and enjoy life.  No centralized authority figure gets to tell us what we are and aren't allowed to do the way they do now (employers/government).

@_date: 2019-11-24 13:22:12
Using a little bit of awareness along with a general dollar cost average technique is what most of us do.
DCA is more about not obsessing with trying to buy in when it's at the absolute bottom, and instead just buying whenever you get a chance, and allowing the fluctuations to average out to being positive or neutral.  But, obviously, it's silly to ignore small dips, if they are around the time you'd expect to buy in.
Basically, DCA with a week or so of wiggle room is probably the best approach, rather than some obsessive schedule that ignores short term fluctuations that are beneficial to you.

The software, and whomever wrote it is the centralized control.
If the rules are the same for both/all parties, then it's centralized rules.  
Decentralized is like how your body has different sets of genes all working together for the same goal (a healthy body).  If everyone's rules are the same, then the governance is centralized.  If everyone is free to use their own rules, but the system still functions as a whole, it's decentralized.
Pretty much only totally natural systems are decentralized.

Yep.  We Gen X types were the first to really start rejecting mainstream culture wholecloth.  The hippies (the beginning of Gen X, and also the tail end of Boomers) started the "turn on, tune in, drop out" ideology of rejecting the whole competitive military-industrial system.  And then that led to disillusionment with the ideology of having a career as a way of life.  Which led to the later Gen Xers like me (born in 1969) to fall into total nihilism.  Which allowed the Gen Y kids to come along and monetize us nihilists philosophizing on the internet, which led Millennials being able to make a mint as social media "influencers".

I see a healthy internet as the very opposite of what he's proposing: open, free, and fully decentralized, and having nothing to do with any central control/company.
It will emerge out of individuals simply putting their content out there, with some kind of simple RSS type feed with tags for author, subject, location, etc., so that it's as searchable and categorizable as possible.  Then anyone can copy the content and share it in whatever way they want.  Basically peer-to-peer file sharing, but more organized, due to some kind of standardized content labeling system.
So if I want to host your website, I can, and vice versa, and I can add onto it or edit it in any way I want, but those changes will be attributed to me, and tagged with my location (at whatever level of detail I want), so that it's clear what is mine and what is yours, since I want to get credit for what I've added, and want others to know who you are as well, since I'm promoting your stuff.
What we have to add to this, of course, is free access to the network itself, with free wifi and cellular data and landline access, as well as free computers/phones/whatever.  But that comes when we finally move to a free society, instead of a monetary game based one.
(Bitcoin might have a role in this system as the blockchain precursor to the database of all of the content and it's labels, for easy searching.)

Decentralization is when we all are free to use our own rules, not when someone else makes the rules up for us.
Real decentralized trading is when I hand you an apple, and you give me a drawing of an apple, with no one else getting in between us.
This is a centralized system that uses open source software, and (I believe) lets anyone participate in trading and doing the escrow management, rather than requiring the legal documents and vetting that regulated companies do.

He's not a tranny.  He's dressing up as something he's not.  It doesn't really have anything to do with gender/sex.
The original is a joke about filters on social media photos, making people look totally different ("better").  He's supposed to be the "no filter" and she's the "filter".  The irony is that the filters make you look fake, but they've made their costumes the opposite way, so that the "filter" is actually the real woman.  So it's sort of weird.
Regardless, this really has nothing to do with transgender.  They aren't dressing up to pretend to be something they aren't.  They are trying to be more like what they feel like they *are*.

You're the one with the weird definition here.  I'm using the dictionary and Marx/Engles definition.




• (in Marxist theory) a transitional social state between the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of Communism.
Socialism has never been done on a national level, despite the lies and deception and confusion you've been exposed to.
Socialism is where there are no private corporations, only employee/publicly owned ones, where the resources going in and out of them are controlled by everyone who works there or has invested resources, equally, using democracy.  There are no private owners/bosses who decide who gets to be hired/fired and what they are paid.  That's private-company-ism, I guess.  Or hierarchical society, perhaps.
Oh, and for the record, Communism is where everyone is free to do what they want, and everyone gets what they need/want for free, with no money involved.  Like how a healthy animal body works.

All competitive point scoring games where individuals are not independently able to generate new points for themselves (through their own efforts) ends up being essentially a "Ponzi scheme" in the sense that whomever IS able to generate the points (especially at the beginning of the game) will always end up "winning" (unless they seriously fuck up).
This is true whether we're talking Bitcoins, $, £, ¥, or even gold to some extent (whomever found the first batch of gold and was able to convince others to value it highly was the big "winner").

Obviously not.  Your body being healthy is the only instrument for deciding if you are getting your needs met.  Just like how a car that isn't running is the only way to know if the car has what it needs.


Obviously not.  Being free means that you're naturally giving away what you don't need, so others can have it, also for free.  Which is how your body works, with each cell doing what it wants to do, which is creating and/or exploring something interesting/useful, and taking what it needs from the public pool of resources.  That's healthy.
When corporations are private and competitive, then that's when stealing becomes the norm.  Take whatever you can get away with from anyone and everyone, since everyone is your competitor!


You're a slave now if you live in the "modern" world of competitive/private corporations and their governments.
I want you to be free to do what you love, and to get what you need to do it well for free.  As nature intends it to be.


Yep, and it's the last gasp of an antiquated, dinosaur meme before it goes extinct, allowing the small, furry, pro-social, playful, creative, intelligent memes of humanity to finally take over the planet, so that everyone can flourish and be valued and enjoy life to the maximum possible level.
No central anything.  No central money (Bitcoin) bribing humans into being slaves to the system just to stay alive.  No central government telling humans what they can and can't do.  No central corporations controlling the resources and encouraging a few individuals to hoard tons of stuff they don't need or want.  Just one big mess of diverse groups of individual animals, vegetables, minerals, and whatever else shows up, all doing awesome stuff because it's what we're made to do, and all the needs getting taken care of through natural diversity of specialization.
It seems scary if you've been brainwashed into thinking that central authorities/control is the only way to keep things stable, but growth is so much better than stability.

Bisq is centralized.  If it's "an exchange" than it is automatically, by definition, a centralized/middleman function, that has at least some control of what happens between peers.
Just go full on peer-to-peer, with friends, family, neighbors, local businesses, etc., as Bitcoin was designed to do.
(Note, if you're downvoting this, you're probably confused.  It's ok.  But do please try to understand that the more services you add to the process of interacting with others, the less control you have.  Satoshi's goal was direct transactions, not adding more banking services like we already have with national currencies.)

Well, if you think about it in the grand scheme of things, most stores have stuff they don't want.  So they are already operating at a level of stuff that is toxic in a sense.  They WANT to get rid of it, really.  No one needs 50 lbs of coffee.  Or 5000 cups.
So in a way, they would be happy to give it all away for free.  They just need to feel comfortable that they can get whatever they DO need in the future.   So if they can also go into another store and get what they want, for free, then they are all set.
We could, if we all really wanted to, stop using money, and start just taking the stuff we want and giving away the stuff we don't want, and it would mostly all work out.  (Since we are finite beings, with limited needs, plus having extreme motivations to create stuff naturally.)
@_date: 2019-11-16 13:17:09
You're looking for stable linear growth, which is artificial.  You can get that in more intentionally planned systems.
But Bitcoin is more natural, and works like learning to walk, with lots of clumsy stumbles forward and then grandly crashing down, and then getting up again to lurch forward, and falling down again.  It's unpredictable, except for the over all progress.  Two steps forward one step back gets you there.

Yep.  Bitcoin is centralized as well.  It's frustrating that so many are so confused about these terms and throw them around without any idea about what they are talking about.  
These centralized systems are designed for "security" by forcing everyone who uses them to follow the same basic rules.  Sure you can fiddle with the decorations on the edges, but the basic rules of how the interactions/transactions function are agreed upon.  Anything straying from those core rules gets booted out of the system as being a "malicious code" or "bad actor" or "hacker".
In a decentralized system there is no shared set of rules, and no security.  Just different individuals doing their own thing, while the overall behavior ends up being one with a shared goal of being healthy (in whatever sense that means for the system).
Art is a good example of a decentralized system: everyone makes stuff using whatever materials they have and like, and makes whatever sort of sensory expression that is meaningful to them, and there are no agreed upon rules, outside of the laws of physics (which we have no choice but to obey!).  It's a free for all, but somehow all this different stuff that gets made becomes a shared element of life that is some kind of self-expression/communication via sensory media.  You *can* set out to try to follow some arbitrary rules that someone else has come up with (trying to please a teacher or copy some previous individual's approach), but you absolutely don't have to, and are free to make things in any way you want, and it will still be a part of the whole functionality that is "art".

Perhaps your definition of dollar cost averaging is different from the ones the rest of us are using.
We tend to use it to describe a less obsessive approach to investing in Bitcoin, where we buy in whenever it seems like a good time, rather than being hyper focused on perfect timing, and since we're spreading out the investments, the average outcome is reasonable, even if some of the timing is not so good.
This doesn't have a goal of making more money, it has a goal of not wasting our mental and emotional energy.
We gain more personal time and energy, and still have a totally reasonable investment benefit.

Nature's psychology is to be decentralized.
We humans just got conned into letting ourselves be turned into obedient, unthinking, uncreative lumps of raw materials for the corporate memes to form into high powered food producers to make them fat.
We allowed ourselves to become the farming slaves to the dinosaur technology.
But there's a new technology in town, and it sees the value of human, and other organismic life, for doing far more complex and creative and fun work, which we're more than happy to do, as long as we have our basic needs met.
So we're becoming equals to technology, with both humans and memes becoming mature enough to play together.  And that means that we can stop having some authoritarian master tell us what to do, and we can figure out what we want to do ourselves, by talking to those we're directly connected to.

Except, of course, bitcoin is entirely controlled via central authorities.  
Bitcoin is not bottom-up, decentralized, since I can't make it myself and decide for myself how to use it the way I do with something that is decentralized, such as language (unless you are French). With language, I can make up a new word, or a new meaning for a word, entirely on my own, and use it in the world.  With bitcoin, I cannot create a new bitcoin on my own, and definitely can't use it, since there are centralized/top-down rules about how this happens.

@_date: 2018-10-23 17:44:09


The point is that no such thing can logically exist.
If it's decentralized then there is nothing in between the two trading partners.  Nothing that would prevent them from sharing/trading with one another.
And yes, it does get complicated when we start putting computers in between individuals, but we can talk about things being decentralized *outside* of whatever basic system we're already working within (the planet, the internet, Bitcoin, etc.) whether that basic system is centralized or decentralized.
Centralized systems offer some sense of "security" as a benefit (for change to happen to the rules some great effort must happen, be that a vote, or an individual authority figure changing their mind), but it risks losing control by the individuals participating in it.  You choose which way you want to go, risk-wise.  Bitcoin had a goal of aiming to be a secure (centralized) currency that offers more control by individuals when making transactions by having a more decentralized (peer-to-peer) option for sending/receiving money compared to national/corporate banks/currencies.  But you can use Bitcoin with an exchange and give up that personal control if you want to be about as secure as a mainstream bank/currency system.
And if you feel inferior to me, that's on your end.  I'm just sharing information that seems to be little known around these parts, so that everyone can understand one another better.

It's a waste for the world, which we are all a part of.  Resources wasted cause problems for everyone.  Homeless people are a drain on the system that you live in, because when you don't have a stable environment to live/work in, you can't contribute your best self to life.  Which wastes even more resources (human resources).

And sure, it's fine to use a centralized system if you want, where all parties agree on some kind of set of rules.  It's just not decentralized.  That term is reserved for when the rules are different for everyone, and it's just the goal that is shared, as in a human body with all the different cells with their different sets of genes and gene expressions doing their own thing, yet all working for the same outcome (a healthy body).

Bitcoin isn't decentralized (it's just not governed by any nation, and is governed by the developers, Satoshi's original plan, and the miners/node-runners).  But it is indeed a game, just like all currencies are, involving point scoring.
You're right it's boring.  Which is why humanity is moving away from the whole competitive approach to organizing ourselves, and towards a more qualitative, collaborative, creative approach.  But Bitcoin is the sort of last gasp of the old game, while we start to transition to using a global tracking database for the freely available resource we're sharing with the world.

 I will say that most of what I wrote here is stuff I've heard from others.  I do have a lot of fairly novel ideas, but this money stuff isn't that.  Though the predictions about what Bitcoin will offer the evolution are part of that.
And I have got a couple of books, but they are... different.  One is sort of a novel for younger folks, and the other is a kid's book on using emotions to tell stories.
I do have another book in mind, but it's a complicated and challenging one and so I'm not in any hurry to get it done.  It is on the basic patterns of reality, bringing math, physics, philosophy, politics, education, and even psychology all together for the general public, using art.

@_date: 2018-10-23 12:58:03
I'm not sure how that isn't completely obvious.
Firstly, money, and other point score keeping games makes what would normally be collaborative relationships into competitive ones.  In order to believe that accumulating money is a "good thing" and a "life goal" we must repress the natural goals we have of doing something valuable and meaningful and fun in life, which is what evolution uses as a way to make progress for life, increasing fitness of life as a whole, over time.  (This is why we're so friggen slow to make progress politically, technologically, and philosophically, compared to what some of us can see possible.)  Instead of scientists, social leaders, and deep thinkers working together to find good solutions that combine the best of everyone's ideas, they feel like they have to "prove themselves worthy" by attacking others' good ideas, and elevating their own mediocre ideas to seem like they are the only possible options.  This wastes everyone's time, energy, and material resources on debating and defending, instead of where it could be used, on understanding and exploring and experimenting with diverse ideas to come to a more useful theory/plan/vision.
Secondly, money is used to bribe individuals into doing things that they don't naturally want to do.  So it's very easy for those who feel pressured to compete against others to use money (or some other point system, such as grades, votes, and "views", to manipulate individuals into wasting their resources on stuff that not only doesn't improve life, but actively makes it worse, for everyone (even the manipulator and "winner").
For a simple example of this, look at how useless war-game/sports games are to those who play them (virtual or in meatspace).  The players spend the entire time trying to stop other players from doing something, and for their efforts, they manage to do almost nothing.  Nothing gets created, almost nothing gets learned, and there's a guarantee that most of the resources will be depleted.  Compare this to a creative activity, where everyone participating has a shared goal of using their resources to make some kind of new thing/idea/theory that helps solve a shared problem that everyone feels is important to solve.  We get a little better when we start forming teams that compete, but we do even better when everyone is collaborating, so that no resources are wasted on offense/defense and all can be invested in the real problem solving effort.  Facing the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster is one of the few times when most humans revert to our natural instincts of collaborating.  We seem to be able to see clearly in this instance, possibly because the extreme circumstances take us out of our "modern world" conditioning, and we revert to our core beings, free from the confusing memes of mainstream socio-political religions (non-universal beliefs about what we "should" do in life).
The real cure to this anti-social viral meme of point scoring games as a way of life seems to be coming soon, as technology finally reaches a state where it's impossible to ignore the reality that pretty dumb robots/computers can do most of the important physical labor that does need to be done for life to flourish, for free, and so we don't need money anymore to bribe comparatively super intelligent humans to do these things.  Which also means that we don't need to bribe humans to do other, really fucked up, things for them to have enough money to feel like they will survive in life.  This will set humanity free, to be truly human, again, but this time we'll have modern technology to play with, so we can accomplish all the astoundingly cool things we've been dreaming of doing for centuries, plus all the stuff we didn't even imagine possible.
Oh, and Bitcoin's role in all this is probably something like this: 
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:50:29
A job is what you do if you're desperate, and is something you have to be bribed to do (with payment).
Work is what life naturally does, because living is all about creating, exploring, and sharing the best stuff in the universe, with a goal of improving life over time.  You might even pay to work, and certainly are very happy when you are free to do it, for free.

Funny, in my world we not only can afford to lose money, but we'd all be better off if we did.  No money means we have to start taking care of ourselves, directly, instead of being (co)dependent on a sick corporate-government mommy/daddy to take care of our needs.  (Badly.)

Centralized: has shared rules that all users follow, or be kicked out of the system (or punished).  Good for stability and predictability.  Rules can be decided upon through any process from pure democracy or consensus to pure totalitarian governance, therefore control can be top-down, or bottom-up and top-down combined.
Decentralized: no rules!  Chaos! Everyone does what they want, and sometimes emergent properties appear, but it's highly unpredictable from the initial conditions.  Good for evolution and adaptation and creativity.  Decisions are made entirely by individuals for their own behavior, and no one has control of anyone else, therefore control is only ever bottom-up.
Basically if it's a free for all, it's decentralized, like art.  And if there are shared rules applied to all, it's centralized.
At least if we're talking logic and systems theory (governance).

They aren't, at least not necessarily.  It's that they choose to do these things, instead of choosing to do other things.


If they are trying to harm others (competing/fighting/attacking in some kind of opposition to them) then they will fail, ultimately, since they will waste all their resources on the fight, and not have any left to creatively solve problems.


That would be, as I mentioned, a waste of resources.  Evolution/entropy means that stuff is always changing and moving towards better, more useful, patterns.  The bad stuff simply doesn't stick around for very long (relative to life as a whole), and simply dies out (goes extinct) as it gets less and less used/procreated/shared.
Solutions that work best get used the most, over time.  We do need to experiment, though, and fully test possible solutions out thoroughly, so we seem to make "mistakes".  But they are necessary part of the growth process.  Like learning to walk means lots of falling over before we figure out what works for staying balanced while controlling our "falling" forward well.


Evolution (via our genes, all interacting with one another).  If it improves life in some way, it will flourish and procreate, if it doesn't, it will die out.  Like the very competitive style of the dinosaurs.)


Money is mostly just a way to con people into wasting their lives doing bad things.  Buy this junk!  Become a slave to some employer who makes junk!  If you don't have lots of money we will deny you the things you need for your body to function well, so do whatever we tell you to do and maybe we'll give you some money!  It doesn't matter how these competitive points are scored (money, grades, votes, etc.), as they are just representations of arbitrary numbers that are used to make you feel, or even be, deficient if you aren't getting more than others around you.

There is no such thing as "security" with information.

It always wants to move from an area of overabundance to an area of underabundance.  That's just how reality works.

Which cell is in charge in your body, which one has all the power to force everyone else to follow it's own rules?
There isn't one.
Because there isn't a hierarchy in your body.  All cells are free.  They all have their own DNA and DNA expressions.  They are independent/free.  All 10,000 different species that make up your body, and all of the individual cell's different personalities (gene expressions) based on all kinds of different changes that go on in their environments.
Cells may all start out as stem cells, with the two different genomes (mitochondrial and the regular one), but they all change and become their own individuals, doing their own thing.  There is no central ruler of cells, and no where else in nature, really.  Just dumb humans who allow themselves to be enslaved.  Being able to be super idiots, going against our own best interests sometimes, just to see what happens, is what separates us from other species.
The good hierarchies aren't government systems.  They aren't about control, as you say they are voluntary, and they are about information.  This is why brains are useful.  The other cells in the body aren't controlled by the brain cells, but they do appreciate the news that the neurons offer them usually.  This freedom allows us to evolve and to be resilient (diversity/specialization) when challenges show up.  This is in contrast to the competitive, constrained system where there is some kind of centralized control, which leads to rigidity and non-growth, or worse.
Here's the real question for you.  What it all comes down to.  Do you want to be free to create and explore awesome stuff in the universe, and get what you need to do that effectively, for free?  Or do you want to be told what you can and can't do, and have to compete just to get some of what you need (and a lot of what you don't) because some corporations/governments are in charge of most of the resources?
@_date: 2018-10-24 22:48:08
Yes, you've gotten the meanings of these words confused.
I'm trying to clarify.  
Socialism is literally where society owns the "means of production" aka, the companies.
Capitalism is literally where there is an investment of capital, or resources.
You can have private capitalism *and* you can have public capitalism.


Erm.  What?!  Socialism and Communism are freedom.  Anarchy can mean a lot of things.  Healthy anarchy is freedom, Communism, liberty.  Sick anarchy is war.
Slavery/authoritarianism is hierarchical organization.  Private corporations are nearly always hierarchical.  Though if there is only one employee, the owner, then it's not.


Right.  And?


Yep.  That's what private corporations do.  The owners and those investing money are valued more than those investing time, energy, creativity, and curiosity.  This is how they get away with slavery.  Some folks have agreed that their investment is worth less than some other's investments, and so it's ok for them to have less ownership of their work.
We're not saying that a person who invests $100 or 100 hours in the company has the same ownership as someone who invests $100,000 or 100,000 hours, we're saying that as long as you are putting resources into making the company successful, you have some ownership of it.  As opposed to investing 100,000 hours and only making 1/100 of what someone who invested $100 or 100 hours does.


In communism there is no need to steal as everything you need is free.
But stealing is something that can happen in any system.  That's just part of reality.  Things don't always stay where you put them.  Tthat's entropy at work.  Not any from of government. :P

If you can find some fun videos on complexity and emergent behavior, like Conway's game of life, and some of Stephen Wolfram's cellular automata stuff they might be more open to the idea of how cool stuff can emerge from simple rules, which is likely how evolution works.
Also, take a look at Pascal's triangle, and see how a multiverse might work, as all possible combinations of matter and energy are "tried" as the system continues to divide stuff up and recombine it in new ways, to make new stuff, even more complex and interesting (overall).  Life is the extra complex stuff in the middle, always getting more diverse and more collaborative...

The problem with websites is that they cost money.  I can afford to pay for one now, but that hasn't always been the case, and might not be the case in the future.
But the internet archive idea is interesting.  I didn't know you could submit your own content there.
I've also considered trying to put my stuff as p2p torrents.  Though I couldn't keep up the hosting myself, and no one else was hosting it either.

That is not knowable.  The details of reality are random.  The overall pattern of randomness is reasonably predictable, to a point, like predicting the weather.
It will be going up dramatically at some point within the next 1-6 months, based on general patterns of growth.  
Right now it's at about 75-80% of the line for exponential growth (sorry I haven't done the math in a couple of weeks, so I'm guessing it is a little lower than the 82% of the line that it was before), and so it's got to go about 25% or so above that line to average things out, at some point.  And since the predicted line right now is right around the old all time high, we know it's most likely to go up far beyond that, linearly, at some point soon.  (Unless something super weird happens to the US dollar, or to the Bitcoin system as a whole.)

No, the Bitcoin community calls itself decentralized.  
In systems theory, though, control in a decentralized system is bottom-up through diverse individuals acting on their own rules.  There is no central set of rules that all must agree on, as there is in Bitcoin.  If you don't follow the basic rules in Bitcoin, you get booted out (forked, if you're lucky, or just rejected entirely if not), as you are labeled as a bad actor or hacker.  In a decentralized system, there is no one to reject your rules, you do what you want.  
This isn't controversial.  It's simple math.  It's just that the folks in the Bitcoin world don't study systems theory, and vice versa, so everyone just assumes that they are talking about the same thing.
What Bitcoin does have is a decentralized system for "hiring" employees (miners/developers/nodes).  No one is in charge of deciding who gets to do the work, it's just whomever shows up to do the work.  But the rules of how the work is done is centralized (Satoshi and the devs mostly, with some democratic voting with mob-rule for deciding whether or not to fork when lots of people have different ideas about how to change the rules.)

The larger body IS the cells.  There is nothing other than the cells making up your body.  (Well, nothing living.)  And the goal of the body is to take care of the cells in it, as well as possible.  This doesn't need to be a highly conscious goal (obviously, since cells are barely conscious at all), it's just what the genes make individuals do.  We all are motivated to do some kind of work that improves life, and continues the process of evolution, whether we are a single cell, or a big pile of them working together (like humans are).  You can think of being free to do what you love, and being supported in doing so as slavery, but that's pretty unusual.  Others think being free to do what you love is self-ish.  So it's all kinda funny how semantics gets involved and gives us contradictory ideas of the same thing.
I know that the idea of not having "free will" and reality being deterministic (governed by physics and nothing else) is scary to some, and that it could feel weird to think that you aren't in control of reality, and it is instead in control of you.  But that's how I see it, as a scientist.  And I find it actually pretty freeing, to know that I am really a story, being told by the universe, rather than the author.
But I know that this isn't something that's taught in most schools or mainstream media, so I understand why you haven't experienced the science of life.

I see your point.  But I think what we generally mean when we say a "middleman" or third party getting in between the first two parties is something **beyond** the normal level of distance between those two parties. As in something that interferes with the normal ability of the two to connect in some way.  That third party would have it's own goals and functions that might prevent the two parties from connecting effectively.


Yes, but what the observer decides to do is determined by the laws of physics.  
And yes, that is what feels like free will.  Because we do not know beforehand what path we will (be aware that we will) take.  Ultimately, we take all of the possible paths, but each one goes down just one, and so is only aware of it's own new direction.
(In general, I think we're saying mostly the same thing.  Except that your future selves, will not just go the way you want them to, but will go all of the possibly ways, so "you" will experience *all* of the best and worst and middling outcomes.)

Decentralized means that generation/creation of something moves from (effectively) independent individuals outwards.  I make something unique, using my own preferences and creative efforts, and then share it with others.
Language is nearly always decentralized.  As is art.
Centralized, on the other hand, means that the generation/creation of things is limited to some set of rules/guidelines that are agreed upon by some larger, external-to-the-individual (centralized) entity, thus restricting the individual and/or the creation process in some meaningful way.
Bitcoin is fully centralized.  Art is fully decentralized (aside from needing to function within the centralized laws of physics, of course).  A system can, in fact, be either one.  Or a mixture, as you suggest.  
Another way to look at it is if there is a "third party" controlling things then it's centralized (since that third party is external to any of the individuals).  How a third party forms can vary, of course, from a popularity contest (with the most average option winning), to a consensus (with the least common denominator winning), to some random selection processes, to an authoritarian rule (which is centralized except for that one individual making it all up on their own :-)

“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist... The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”

It's not suboptimal if you want to have a normal life not obsessed with trading exchange rates.

Also, no one ever said that you can't invest more when there's a big dip.  DCA has a goal of not being obsessive, in any way, and that means that it's fine to take advantage of dips, it's just allowing you to not care so much when you don't time things perfectly, and being happy with a nice average, as long as things don't only ever go down.

Either that (a lack of output needs) or a lack of the input needs.  Yes.  That's how biology works.  Stress makes us go into the fight/flight/freeze mode.  Lack of the basic needs causes stress, so a healthy environment, where one is getting the input and output needs that the body requires for healthy function, means that there is no violence, fear, or depression to speak of, and instead there is creative, intelligent, productive exploration and creation and sharing of awesome things.  
This is why humans created civilizations, where we could take better care of ourselves, and thus flourish more easily.  Not utopia obviously, but way, way better than before, when we were contstantly worried about even the most basic needs like shelter, water, food, places to poop, and share ideas.


What?  Where on Earth did you get that?  That's the opposite of what I've been saying.  Demanding bribes for what you do is what is harmful, compared to doing what you love (creating and exploring and sharing awesome stuff) for free.  Those who look to make a profit are the ones who are not "paying their fair share".  They are taking more than even they believe they deserve from society.  That's what a profit is.  And it's why people who do make a profit feel like shit, deep inside, though they might not know why, and simply chalk it up to "bad neurochemistry" and drug themselves into temporary happiness.
And you can paint a delusional picture of who I am to defend yourself from taking me seriously, but why?  Why are you so scared of being free?  What would happen if you allowed yoruself to do what you love, follow your dreams for exploring and creating and sharing the most awesome stuff in the universe, as only you can do?

That's the con that you've been sold.  The idea that the work you want to do, the fun, interesting, awesome stuff that you were born to naturally want to do in life, doing some kind of creative and/or exploratory thing that makes you happy, isn't what you "should" be doing.  It's insane.  Evolution knows what it's doing, and it made a diverse ecosystem with someone to fit nearly every role that needs to be served to make a healthy system.  Someone, somewhere, wants to do the work that needs to get done, for free, whatever that work is, including inventing technology to do the work that no one wants to do.
You might have had your dreams repressed, and not even be aware of the kind of creating and/or exploring awesome stuff that you would love to do in life, totally for free, but your genes still have that information in there, somewhere.  And when you let yourself be free, instead of being enslaved by the sick, competitive, centralized government system (be it run by capitalists or communists), you are likely to discover what you were born to do.  And you'll be so happy.

It was highly recommended here when I started looking for something that worked well for me back in like 2016 when the tip thing on Reddit was being killed off, and I also wanted to put a donation address on my podcast.

Ultimately, all offerings of resources can be free of the whole score-keeping concept.  That's because we always take in as much as we output, and vice versa.  And someone, somewhere, can use what we output, and outputs what we want to input.  It's just that it's a much larger system of sharing than the whole one-to-one trading idea.  And, of course, a lot of what we output is for the next generation, so a lot of what we do is pay-it-forward, rather than paying things back (debt).

Evolution doesn't destroy things, it just lets them go extinct naturally, while creating new, better, more fit things to replace them.  And what's replacing the zero-sum, anti-social, competitive game approach to life is the collaborative, positive-sum, pro-social game of a healthy freee economy where everyone does what they love, and evolution does it's randomness thing to ensure that there is plenty of specialization of work for the whole system to function well, on a global scale, just like it works on a single organism scale (your body).
As for the "educated communist" I have no clue what you're talking about.  Certainly not me.  Since communism, at least in it's real-world application, is just as bad as capitalism, in evolution's opinion.  They are both dinosaurs of the memetic kind.

The one thing that I think that we can do to help this community based-organizing happen more effectively is to help humans clarify what their greatest dreams are for exploring and/or creating the most awesome stuff in the universe are, and let them know that the world really wants them to follow those dreams (instead of taking a job to pay the bills).
We all have uniquely excellent stuff we want to do, that is both personally rewarding and fun, and benefits the whole of society, in some way.  We just need to be able to do it.
For some that might be inventing robots to do the lame jobs humans don't want to do, but want done, and for others that might be making people laugh, or exploring space, or writing history books, or finding out how many pages of paper you can cover with one BiC pen. :-)

I'm sorry this upsets you so much.
The way we do dollar cost averaging is random, mostly.  Just spread out.  So that the fluctuations aren't traumatic to us.  So we can just invest casually and not waste time worrying, like we would with a single point of investment.
But if you don't understand the benefit, then don't do it.
@_date: 2019-11-24 13:18:00
It doesn't have to be pre-set intervals to use the dollar cost average plan, it just means to not worry about timing things obsessively.
You can still focus on buying when it's in a dip, but you don't get all crazy trying to only buy at the lowest exchange rate.  It's fine to just buy whenever you happen to have a chance, and let the fluctuations average things out.
@_date: 2019-11-25 19:50:42


Except that I clearly am doing the opposite, since I specifically talked about a specific sub-group of Bitcoin users.
And yes, choosing to accept Bitcoin as a way to get more bitcoin, and do so at more random points, spread out over time, is exactly what our goal when we do dollar cost averaging is.

Socialism is capitalism.  But you mean private companies, rather than socialist-public ones, I think.
Socialism is where everyone in the company has an equal share in the ownership.  Cooperatives generally run this way.
If someone else can decide how much of the profit/earnings you get, then you aren't an equal owner.  That's private companies (non-public, non equal).
You can be one of the elite owners in a private-company system, but in socialism *everyone* who does anything to help the company do it's work is an owner, both investors of material resources (or money) *and* investors of time and energy and curiosity and creativity.  All effort is valued equally, rather than arbitrarily or hierarchically.
You want to be in the system where your efforts are valued, don't you?  (Regardless of who you're working with.)
And ultimately, like your own body, you want to be in a system where you're completely free as are all other resources, to flow wherever you want.  This way you can be your best, and be as happy as possible.
Marx and Engles called that Communism.
I just call it a normal biological system.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:00:54


A "collaborative, positive-sum, pro-social game of a healthy free economy" is the opposite of capitalism.  Capitalism is competitive, zero-sum, anti-social, and quite obviously not at all free (since the goal is to charge as much money as possible, rather than letting resources flow freely).
And yes, the goal is for all humans to do what they love.  Because evolution needs us to.  We're all programmed by our  ("random mutation") genes to have a unique set of abilities and interests that fill some niche role that the ecosystem needs done.  And we feel inherently motivated to do this, as well as being naturally rewarded for doing it, through our neurochemistry.  
And yes, ALL work that needs to get done will be lovingly done by someone, somewhere, because that's how evolution/nature works.  It's the most effective system know to the universe, having sorted things out over billions of years of variation and natural selection, to generate ever higher levels of fitness on ever larger scales (cells, organisms, small ecosystems, and eventually the whole planet, and beyond).  
But, because evolution required some super highly diverse and creative individuals to help connect the whole planet together (with it's central nervous system and circulatory system in the form of global communication and transportation/shipping networks), the unpleasant side effect was the ability to create fictions/science/theories/beliefs that are exceptionally harmful and objectively "wrong" (such as "life is a competitive, zero-sum, violent game).  So, like a toddler learning to walk, we have had to do a fuckton of falling down, memetically, before we are just now starting to learn how to stay upright, and forward moving, so that we can make some really positive progress using our superpowers (creativity) for good, rather than evil.

Often, since biology is based on objective science, while economics is more of a religion and is based on a combination of arbitrary theories and emotions.  Which is why they are so often so very bad at predicting things.


Nope.  That's not any human being's desire.  Other than for eating purposes (all animals eat something alive, so we have to kill at least a bit).  Murder that isn't food related is something that shows up when humans have had their actual dreams for creating and exploring and sharing awesome stuff repressed.  It's psychopathy, an illness, that is environmentally triggered, not innate.

Just FYI, there aren't actually these "problems" in evolution that Szabo lists at the beginning of this article. 
That's because evolution made social animals that are born to naturally be motivated to collaborate, as it's the most effective and efficient way to use resources and organize a system.  Money actually gets in the way of that, as it rewards cheating, which harms the system and creates wasted resources.

Humans are obviously a resource as well.  We call ourselves human resources sometimes. :-)


That's what money does.  It makes them not evaluate their value themselves, and puts an arbitrary number on it.  So humans end up having no idea that what they are being paid to do is actually harmful, or at least a waste of their talents, time, energy, etc.  It's only when we are free to judge the value of our work for ourselves, using our internal programming for what's good and bad for life, that we grow as as species.  
Money gets in the way of us knowing what's good.  I can pay you to make/sell junk food, and you might be convinced that what you're doing is a valuable service.  But in reality you're making people sick while making money for some investor/boss, when you could be making something really healthy, for free.


Nothing causes entropy.  It's what causes everything.  EVERYTHING.  It's the laws of physics that generate the universe, as far as we know.  It's what makes life evolve.  Taking apart older, boring things and using the parts to make newer, more interesting things.  (This is just a fundamental process of reality, as far as we understand.  It's just what happens when nothingness and everythingness combine.)


Except physics.  Nothing stays the same.  Change is all that ever happens.  And change in a certain direction.  (Simple to complex.  Aka, boring to fun.)  Monopoly is a boring game.  We're evolving to be more fun in our games of life.  Something where we're all doing different things for different reasons (on a superficial level) while an emergent organism is created (a whole Earth that is procreative, presumably).
Money isn't evil, really, but it's boring and dumb and harmful to life.  So it's going extinct.  Bitcoin is helping that happen:

Each strategy for competitive game play is useful, for a while, in some situations.
But no strategy ever lasts or is useful in all situations when you're talking about a zero-sum game, and that's because of entropy.  (Everything changes.)
The Black Swan is risky, but gives a better payoff than the "cool headed" approach, in many situations, same with lots of random gambles.  But the "cool headed" approach is also subject to larger swings of the pendulum of reality, so it can go really badly as well.
The only way to win, in the end, is not to play, and to instead play a more collaborative game of life which is positive sum.  (Being creative with others and sharing resources freely.)

Anyway, I hope that at some point soon you are helped in being free to do what you love, creating and exploring and sharing the most awesome things in the universe, according to your own unique perspective on life, fully and openly and freely, rather than whatever you've felt forced to do before, just to compete/argue against your fellow Earthlings.

How can you say that the system doesn't involve a "middleman" when you litearlly can't just exchange points with someone standing next to you, and instead have to go to a third party (that's what a middleman is) to do the exchange.  And you have to exchange it using their rules, not your own.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:13:06
But what does "false" mean?  In a reality where there are likely infinite universes, where everything that can possibly happen does happen (according to current physics this is how things probably work), then most of what we imagine does end up happening, somewhen and somewhere.
That means that whether you are an optimist, a pessimist, or a realist (like me), what you imagine happening does happen.
So, trying to "correct" someone's vision of the future they think is likely to happen seems silly, since there is no "correct" future, except, maybe, all of them.
From the perspective of someone who's nearing death (or a species nearing extinction) their future is indeed dark.  But from a broader perspetive, looking at how evolution seems to always increase fitness (through random mutation and natural selection) of life overall (more diversity to allow for more success in adapting to any and all environments, even space!), things look pretty awe inspiring.  Both are "true" perspectives, and both the dark and light outcomes happen, so it's really just all down to what part of reality you're looking at.

While I agree that non-consentual behavior is harmful, I will also add that taxes on profits are not punishing people for not being a loser, but taking more than you deserve, which is literally what profit is.  (Taking more value than the value put in to what you're offering.)  Taxes on profits (not income, but capital gains on investments, or on selling products or services) is punishing you for anti-social behavior.
Income taxes, on the other hand, are something else.  More like a membership fee for having the benefits of citizenship.
Ultimately, of course, a healthy economy does away with the whole competitve game of money entirely, and instead allows everyone to be free to both offer and receive the things they need to.

Well, if the multiple universe theory is a reasonable representation of our reality (and it seems very likely) then everything that can possibly happen does happen, at some point in space~time.  So some things can be said to " definitely happen", with at least a reasonable amount of science/logic.
In some time line, for some observers, it seems like it's totally possible for bitcoin to go up that much in value relative to other arbitrary monetary point score systems, given that those other systems are antiquated and too centralized for "modern" technology to keep supporting.
That doesn't mean you and I will see that time line.  But it's not at all an outlier time line, as far as I can tell.

It's not utopian at all, it's basic biology.  A healthy living system, such as a human body, HAS to be free to move resources around from where they are produced/offered to where they are needed/useful or it gets sick.  Which is what we have now with our planetary ecosystem/organism.
Evolution always moves things away from competition (zero-sum games like $, £, ¥, etc.) and towards collaboration, which is where we are heading.

Using bitcoin is what happens when I want to give someone else some of my "points".  Say, when I want to buy something.  
Running the system that keeps up the ledger is the accounting process, where ALL exchanges (and point generation) are kept track of.
Using bitcoin isn't peer-to-peer because I and anyone I'm giving points to have to have the whole centralized system check to make sure what we are doing is within their rules.  So there is a third party involved in my exchange.
Running the ledger process is peer-to-peer in the more specific sense of there not being a single computer, but instead a network of computers that are all equal and all talking to one another, with at least some of them being direct connections of one peer talking to another.

Um, I said it does NOT turn poorly easily.  You said it easily can.  I'm saying that what you said doesn't apply.  It would take some serious shit for a healthy relationship to go poorly.  And we're not just talking about struggling with taking care of buildings, and living together.


I'm not sure what you're talking about.  You mean if the house burned down and there was no insurance or something?  Then yeah, healthy relationships definitely deal well with this, compared to unhealthy relationships.  Sure you all have worries, but you work together to solve problems.  That's the point.  You're in it together.  So you're stronger.


That would be a sick relationship.  If your "friends" are like this (or you are), and would sue one another, then you've got problems.  Not monetary ones.  But relationship ones.  Good relationships don't "breakup".  They stay healthy through challenges and come out stronger for working together.

It does go through a central service.  Yes the functionality of that service is distributed, since you're running the software on your own computers (like with Bitcoin), but you're not directly sending Bitcoin from your wallet to someone else's wallet (or from their national currency bank account to yours).  
Just like Bitcoin is not decentralised as a currency, it's just more distributed in the cloud than national currencies are, Bisq is not a decentralized exchange, but does have a more distributed system in the cloud.  (And who gets to be in that cloud is different, obviously.)
Bitcoin can be peer-to-peer, even though it's centralized, though.  But Bisq is neither.  Bisq is just a distributed, voluntary centralized exchange.  Which is fine.  But not what Satoshi promoted as the ideal.  Which was literally just me sending you Bitcoin, and vice versa.

Studying "economics" in mainstream academia and corporations/governments does indeed make humans pretty ignorant and closed minded to how life actually works, and can work, when a system is healthy (and free).  But even amateurs get this from even just a little bit of exposure to "economics" in mainstream media.

What a silly idea.
All money does is get in the way of a free flowing society.  In a healthy system individuals need to be *free* to fully express themselves (outputting the materials and energy that their bodies create), and resources need to be *free* to flow from where they are created to where they are useful/needed (by other individuals' bodies).
Money means that we are not free.  We are repressed and deficient, instead.  That makes us all, and the system as a whole, sick.
The only option is to be free.  The way nature intends us living things to be.
Money is the artificial gunk getting in the way of that, and it's what keeps humanity, and our technology, from fourishing.  When technology "costs money" it can't expand and grow naturally (yes, this sounds weird, but nature WANTS technology, since it's a part of how life expands in diversity and space).

So, the word means whatever you want it to mean.  You can choose to love it or hate it or fear it or not care much about it at all.  You have the freedom here to decide what to do with it.  I choose love.  I almost always choose love.  I have little time for hate in my life.  But maybe you haven't had enough love in your life to share it, in which case I'm really sorry.

I think you're confused here.  We're talking about whether or not bitcoin is centralized.  Centralized means that the control is coming from outside of the individual, thus preventing the individual from generating something new.  This is how bitcoin works, since I can't simply decide to create new value on my own, or change the rules for how things work on my own.  Thus the power is centralized.  Sure, that central authority is fairly unknown, and spread out around the world, but it's still under a central/top-down control, just like all the other mainstream currencies/score-keeping-systems.
Language, on the other hand, is and always has been primarily decentralized.  Every word that exists was generated by an individual, somewhere, and somewhen.  Yet you and I understand many of those words!  The adoption of these words that individuals create is also up to individuals, rather than some central authority (Except in a few rare instances... See: France, and with some religious and "science" terms).
For a currency to be bottom-up/decentralized, it would have to be entirely created by, and agreed-upon by individuals, operating independently and freely.  In such a case *all* bitcoins would be unique and differently valued, just like each word is for humans (and other word-users).
One way to think of how a truly decentralized currency would work is to image that each "coin" is a piece of artwork, hand made, and unique.  To be digital, it would simply be a one-of-a-kind drawing or song or something similarly creative.  You could create your own bitcoin by generating some art piece, and then submit it to the "ledger", which would keep the pattern of this unique coin on file and keep track of who owned it.

Trek wasn't too bad, but they still missed a lot of the science of biology and physics, when it comes to how societies work.
To see a real model of how our planet will evolve, take a look at how an individual animal evolved, from single celled organisms to having a whole multicellular organism with each individual cell working collaboratively for the whole, and being free to do what it wants to do, while getting what it needs so that it can do what it wants to do as well as possible, so that the whole diverse gang can take care of all of the needs of the larger organism.
That's what our planet will be like once we get a fully functioning circulatory and nervous system to move resources around freely will look like, on a larger scale, of course. :-)

Right there are no utopias.  That would be silly.  But a healthy society is the only thing that ever survives, and it's been proven to be the most effective approach to life through evolution.  It relies on selfish behavior.  
Right now almost no humans act in their own self interest, and instead repress their real dreams and goals in order to become enslaved to coporations and banks and their governments.  Which is why our system is so sick and the meme of life as competition is going extinct, slowly.
And since I started doing all my work for free, or nearly all of it, everything has been so much better for me and those around me.  But I've always been a bit ahead of the crowd, so I figure if I started being free about 10 years ago, even the most forward thinking of the mainstream folks will start doing it in another 5-10 years.  So I wait, patiently, for people to stop being enslaved by the antiquated and irrational memes of the global Monopoly game, and start being totally free to follow their dreams and create, explore, and share the most awesome things in the universe, without repression.

I have no idea what you mean there.    (Also, were you looking for this symbol perhaps? ≠) Decentralization means that the control/rules of the system are independent and bottom-up, with individuals having the power to decide their own rules.
Centralization is where the power to make rules rests in a central authority of some sort, with everyone in the system being forced to obey the same rules (or at least an attempt to do so).  
If you are curious about systems theory as it relates to centralized and decentralized power, there's a really fun little interactive exploration about it here, by the wonderful Nicky Case: 


Yep.  Any time that individuals are free to choose their own rules for behavior.
Bitcoin is the opposite.  It's artificially controlled by a central set of rules.


Which is the opposite of what Bitcoin does.  Everyone has to obey the same rules.  Some group, regardless of how it gets created, decides the rules for everyone else.  If you don't like it, you get kicked out of the system.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:53:46


Why do you think this?  It totally fits the normal definition.  It's an entiry/individual thing that does stuff.


I didn't say there wasn't free will.  I just said that it's all deterministic, at least if we look at the logical options.  There is no way that there can be an option that doesn't involve some kind of law of nature/physics that governs the behavior of everything.  Even if you add in a supernatural power that's doing it (which itself must be governed by some other super-supernatural power).
Yes, I agree that randomness is what we call free will.  But it's deterministic.  Randomness is generated by some function (a mathematical process) and the way to do that is super simple, and sensible for generating a multiverse.  (Again, see Pascal's triangle, to understand how randomness is deterministic.)
How our minds work, and the universe that we observe, is determinstic, as generated by the simple laws of nature.  At least that's the only reasonable option that I can see.
If you see another option, please let me (and the rest of the physics community) know.  Because that would be revolutionary.

Ermmmm.  What?
Specialization came about long before trade, and even humans.  Trade is an artificial, anti-social tactic, which constantly makes things worse, becuase it hinders freedom, and encourages hoarding and it's related illnesses of overwhelm and bloating.
Specialization is why we do NOT need to trade.  It's why we can just let everyone be free to do what they want to do, because nature/evolution makes everyone want to do different kinds of work, so that all the work that needs to get done does get done, by someone, somewhere, as long as everyone is free.
RIght now almost no one is free, and so our system is totally fucked up.  But because the con game of competiting for money and being enslaved to the banks and other corporations has been so successful, even those who do the conning don't realize that it's a deadly lie.
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:43:06


Um, no.  That's the opposite of socialism.  Socialism is where the people own their own labor, not someone else.  The term you're looking for is probably either authoritarian or monarchy or meritocracy or democracy.
Just because someone, somewhere called something X doesn't mean it is X.  People lie and deceive and are confused.  You are the latter, I hope.
The term socialism is based on the term social, as in a government that is pro-social, and supportive of the people, rather than corporations, or itself.


Socialism usually involves capitalism.  It's then transition state between fully private, hierarchical corporations, owned only by those who have invested the most "capital" in them (the stock owners, literal owners, and other major investors), and a fully Communist state (where everyone is free to do what they want and get what they need for free, with no money/trade necessary, as in how our animal bodies work).
Socialism is where the individuals who do the work and/or invest in the companies are all equally owners of the companies (cooperatives), and have control over their resources, usually democratically.
Private corporation-ism is where some boss or set of bosses decides who gets hired/fired and how much they are paid, and keeps as much of the profits as they desire (for the most part, outside of some occasional regulation).  This is slavery, essentially, for everyone except the owners (and they are slaves to the monetary game, though that's a different thing).

I'm saying that you WILL believe whatever you want (or do believe).  Because what you believe is based on what you experience, and what you experience is different from what everyone else experiences.  Your universe does interact with mine, even though they are different.  Reality is connected.  The individual who is dying and sees only darkness and the individual who sees how evolution is always increasing the awesomeness of life are able to not just speak to one another, but even live together, and love one another.  And see reality from one another's perspective, to a large extent, while not actually having the same future, or experiences.
This is based on the math and physics of reality, which is why I say I'm a realist.  The idea that humans are competitive in nature is based on a very limited experience, compared to one that has researched animal behavior, and especially human behavior, from psychology, to neurology, to philosophy, to biology, to evolution, to physics, and even to personal relationships.  Homo-sapiens are social animals, and in every study ever done on humans, the instinct to collaborate and contribute awesome stuff to the world shows up as long as the basic needs are met. (See: Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the levels of "self-transcendence" above the deficiency needs of physiological inputs (high quality food, water, air, warmth, light, information) and outputs (he calls this "safety" which is really freedom of self expression), along with love and belongingness (being a part of a family or "tribe" as you say), and effectiveness (doing fun and intersting work with others.)
Money gets in the way of us all getting the things we need, because it encourages hoarding things we don't need, and denying others the things they do need.  And because we refuse to share, others refuse to share, and it's one big malfunctioning system.  Which is what we have now, with nearly all humans and other Earthlings sick and threatened with more sickness.  If this is what you want, then keep it up.  (Or wait until the rest of us stop using money, and try it our way, and see what you think.)  There will always be room for small groups of outliers doing weird stuff, like competing against one another just to barely survive, as a sado-masochistic game.  But the rest of us will evolve, and start being free to do what we love, for free, and getting the whole system taken care of, freely, as we all make and discover the best that the universe has to offer and share it with our fellow Earthlings, and anyone else who happens to show up, here and on all the other planets we explore.
(If you are confused about how this would work, either look at how an animal body works, with all the cells being free to do the work they naturally are motivated to do, and get what they need from the system, for free.  Or consider what it would be like to have a small colony started on a new planet, where it makes no sense to have banks or stores where things cost money, and makes total sense for everyone to work together on the shared goal of living well, and getting everyone's needs me to be healthy and happy for as long as possible.)

Reality is very different from your imagination.  Nearly always.  Especially when it comes to biology and the compexities of social interaction.
In reality, all humans naturally want to do important work, it's a basic need.  As Maslow showed.  We want to contribute to the world, because that's what the genes of all living things program us to do.
It takes a whole lot of conning and bribing and mis-education by parents, teachers, the media, governments, and PR departments to repress those instincts.
Get rid of that repression and we all start doing awesome stuff, for free.  Making the world an awesome, free place, finally.

I got this from the overwhelming research on psychology, biology, chemistry, and physics. 
Selfishness is good, it's healthy, because what the genes want is for life to keep going, to thrive, and for future generations to have a higher level of fitness (in the evolutionary sense, not just physically, but emotionally, intellectually, and philosophically/morally) than the current generation.
If greed was a normal instinct there would never have been any evolution beyond maybe a lucky few single celled organisms.  But that's not the case.
And even single celled organisms are regularly collaborative. 
And, certainly, no living things are ever naturally inclined to be greedy, since taking more than they need to take makes them sick or at least burdened.  It's challenging enough in life to do well with what you need, it's far harder to do well with a pile of excess crap that you don't need.
But, because humans are complex and capable of intellectual experimentation, we have the option to try out deception, anti-social tactics, ignorance, and so on, so we do, as we promote the philosophy that life is all about hoarding and money and competition and other silliness.  
But since we are also always testing stuff out, as our brains are natural scientists, we're slowly finding that these bizarre memes are unfit for life for the most part.  And we're starting to reject them, and let them die out like the dinosaurs, who were the genetic equivalent, you could say, trying to overpower everyone else, and falling hard because that's not how you fit into an ecosystem well.

If you have too much of something, the laws of nature will make it so that you eventually get rid of it, and if you have too little of something, nature will make it so that it will try to get it to you.

Money is never freedom.  Money is actually enslavement, of the whole of human society.  If you have to bribe others to offer you the things they don't need, then there is something wrong with the system.
Yes, I know this is thinking at a higher level than what you intended in your post, but I wanted to add the higher level of thinking to the conversation, since people like to thow around the term "freedom" without actually realizing what it is.  If you are charging money for what you create/explore/share/do in life, you are not free.  Literally or metaphorically.  And the same goes if you have to pay money for the stuff you need, in order to create/explore/share/do the awesome stuff you really want to do in life, then you are also not free.


Indeed.  That's because life punishes those who try to take more than they need, in one way or another.  Anti-social behavior, like making a profit, is inherently going to go extinct, since natural selection moves things towards more fitness over time (and fitness means how well you help a system out, improving it's overall health).

Why are you concerned about keeping score?  Why not just do what you love and take what you need from what is freely offered by everyone else who's also doing what they love?
Like, do you keep track of how many molecules of carbon dioxide you are giving to the trees?  And making sure that you only poop a certain amount, and withhold the rest, if you don't get enough food that day from your environment?  Does your heart save up blood "for a rainy day" instead of constantly pumping it around your body?
It makes no sense whatsoever to assign an arbitrary number to all the things that living organisms create and output from their bodies (be it solid, liquid, gas, energy, or information) since we want to encourage living things to express themselves freely, so that we are the most creative as possible, and the less sick (from repressed stuff, physical and mental), as we can be.

My guess is that it's happening, globally, in bits and pieces, but will come to a peak in the early 20's, when the monetary system explodes with volatility, and some technological innovation will allow us to start taking care of our own needs, directly, instead of being (co)dependent on corporate/government authoritarian systems.
We'll naturally form small guilds/communities/collectives (virtual and meatspace) to take care of ourselves on a small scale, collaborative, consensual way, while networking those local hubs to form a global system that helps move larger volumes of resources around from where they are overabundant to where they are useful for improving life.
Essentially, a global organism.

I never said anything about not having government.   Not even close.  
Take a look at the governance that is bottom-up if you are curious about the science of a healthy system, by doing some exploration of the topic of systems theory and complexity theory.




No.  No one actually thinks those things are good.  They believe those things are "necessary evil" when they feel they have no better option.  Why have they felt this way?  Becauese they were enslaved, sick people who were scared and confused and not getting their needs met by their environment because those around them are also scared and sick and enslaved.  Violence (aka trying to gain power/control over an attacker), be it physical, emotional, intellectual, or philosophica/spiritual/moral, is one of the default options for dealing with threats and harm (it's part of the fight/flight/freeze set of responses to stress).  But it's not what anyone actually wants because it's hugely costly to one's health and ability to grow and procreate, which is the entire purpose of all living things (note that procreation isn't just genetic but memetic as well, passing on infomation packets about what works and what's good to new generations in some way).
The meme that greed and hoarding and violence and such are "just human nature" ignores all the science of social animals, as well as ignoring even personal experience of what humans actually love to do and value the most.  If you look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs you'll see how at every level all we really want is to take good care of life, with an ever expanding circle of types of individuals we are able to care for and serve.

Um.  I'm asking what term you would use to describe our current government/corporate/social system.  The one you don't want to describe as capitalism.
And yes, the monetary/banking game is zero-sum, because if one individual makes a profit (gains something extra) that is at the expense of someone else (they have to lose that extra).  If I give you $10, you gain those 10 dollars and I lose them.  See here: 


I was talking about our planet.  Have you seen the state of it?  It's super sick.  We've fucked it up royally.  And now we have to help it heal before we kill ourselves through abuse of our environment, which is the thing that we depend on, for pretty much *everything* that keeps us alive. :P
But yes, all of us humans are sick as well, both you and I, and every human around us, due to the above environmental problems that we haven't dealt with.  It's what causes you to insult my ideas, for example.  And what causes me to be fat and tired all the time.  (Among a whole lot of other symtoms for both of us.)  
This sickness is what causes us to believe that we are our own enemies, to be battled, and attacked, and stolen from.  The illness is what causes both the hoarding of capitalism and the theft of communism, both of which are harmful to us, compared to real freedom both in giving and receiving the things our bodies need to input and output.

I heard about Circle here and last night I signed up and went to try to buy some Bitcoins with it.  They took money out of my debit card and put it into my normal Circle account, but then refused to send the Bitcoin, with no explanation.  I thought that I might need to confirm my identity (this appears to be the case), so I did the photo thing, and submitted it, but then heard nothing back.  I tried again transferring the $ into Bitcoin, and it refused again, with no explanation.  I sent an email to their customer service, but didn't hear back until this morning, when they said everything was approved.  By the time I finally was able to send the Bitcoin, the exchange rate had gone up by about $25.  Grrrrrr.

Accepting Bitcoin for normal sales is the best of dollar cost averaging.  Volatility is not at all a problem, since you can trade whenever you want.
The only real challenge is dealing with taxes, as you note.
But then that's true no matter what currency you're using, if you live in a part of the world where you have to keep track of everything your business takes in and spends.
Taking Bitcoin is probably ideal for online sales for high price items/services that are global.
But if you're panicky, as your comment suggests, then maybe don't get into a risky business at all, where you have to deal with the normal fluctuations of the market and stick to something like providing funerals.

I would suggest not debating anyone.  It's silly.  Conversation isn't a contest, it's an opportunity to learn something new, see reality from a perspective very different from your own, or of those you normally hang around.  When talking about reality, which is far more complex than a simple two sided coin, you can see how all of the different "sides" that seem opposing are actually accurate descriptions of reality.
But, if you want to just rage at someone because you're angry about how the world treats you, then feel free to rage at me, randomly, because I understand that rage.  I feel it to.

There is bottom-up governance (like your body) and top-down governance.  They are polar opposites, and one is proven to work over all of the history of life, and the other is proven to make everyone miserable. :P
A healthy system doesn't have rules and laws and violence as a way of life, it is free and everyone is supported in being their unique selves, rather than trying to force everyone to be the same.
And as for money, that gets in the way of all of the freedom.  Money is a zero-sum, competitive, anti-social game, while a free economy, where everyone is able to do what they love, follow their own dreams for creating, exploring, and sharing the most awesome stuff in the universe (from their perspective), has no blockages that get in the way of that freedom.   There is no need for bribing anyone to do something, they just do it for free, because they WANT to.  That's how nature works.  Life has an instictive drive to improve life, always, and forever.  Money gets in the way of that because it cons people into not being free, and not doing what they love.  So we get a whole planet of sick humans, as well as all the other Earthlings suffering as well.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:57:59
It does feel that way, indeed.  That feeling is presumably what we mean when we say "free will".
But in reality, you will take ALL of the future possible paths.  But each split version of you will only experience one of them.  The you that is you now will be ALL of them, not just one.  Though it won't feel that way, since the future, split versions of you will only be aware of the one that they took.
And I mean "probably" for all this.  No one really knows.  But this is the most reasonable option right now, given the physics and such. :-)

The reality is that all individuals are biased, all sources are imperfect, misleading, and deceptive.  All are shitty, to some extent.  And all have at least some value, as well.  Even the most blatant lie is informative when combined with all the other perspectives.
As I said, the idea that far too many folks think that it's ok to "trust" a source is the really terrifying thing that is, as you suggest, keeping us in the dark ages.  When folks allow authoritarian rulers to tell them what to think and do and believe, we get an ignorant, uncreative, ineffective public who will leap off the cliff, or worse, push someone else off, at someone else's command.
If you don't realize that all sources are shitty as well as informative, in unpredictable proportions, always, then you are subject to manipulation and removing your ability to think for yourself.  Appealing to authority for your beliefs is the most dangerous thing you can do in your life, in my opinion.

Reddit itself is probably a good 20% hired guns looking to promote someone's product or idea.  "Social media advertising" (paid plants in the audience) is now a norm, as it bypasses most of the more superficial blocks on old fashioned ads.  Not only can you not block them with adblockers, but you often can't even tell the difference between them and the volunteer folks like the rest of us, who are sharing our ideas and perspectives because we actually care about them.
One trick to see if there are paid shills in a discussion is to look at the downvotes.  If there are a lot of downvotes on someone's comment, unless the comment is really just terribly mean or dumb, there are probably shills involved.  They never come alone.

OK, three things.  The first one is the most "normal" which is that the ledger and it's management software is indeed run by humans (man), and is clearly manipulated, as we just saw with the whole segwit change.  Actual peer-to-peer money would be money/points that I can just give to someone else without any other process getting in the way (stopping me from doing it, for example, if I don't do it accoring to someone else's rules).
The second one is where I point out that "middleman" doesn't literally require a man.  Or even a human.  Or even a living creature.  It's a general term for a third party that gets in between the first and second parties.
And the third one is where I point out that ALL things in the universe (or multiverse) are autonomous machine that just exist and operate deterministically, whether we are animals, vegetables, minerals, or whatever.  There doesn't seem to be any other option for how reality works.  The laws of nature (physics) generate reality as it runs some program (mathematical function) and whether that's some weirdly biased function (producing one one particular universe that does one specific thing), or a totally random function (like Pascal's triangle) that produces all possible universes (the most likely scenario as current physics suggests), there seems to be no room for non-determinism.
Even if you try adding in a "programmer" in supernatural god form, who doesn't have to follow the rules of our own (biased) universal laws, and can change the program at will, you still need to ask how *that* individual exists, and what their laws of physics are.  (Which really just adds another layer to reality, leaving us with the same result of determinism being the only viable option.)

Communism and Capitalisim are equally bad.  They both aim to serve only one need, while totally denying the other.  We need freedom in BOTH inputs and output needs. 


That's the con you've been sold to keep you enslaved and unfree.  Sorry.  It really sucks to be conned.  We hate finding out that what we've been told is a lie.  To the point where we deny that it is a lie.  Vehemently.  Which is probably what you're going to do here.
But, the reality, as science overwhelmingly has discovered, is that all animals naturally love to explore and create awesome stuff in life, freely, with the diversity of evolution's "random mutation" ensuring that all the different kinds of work that needs to get done in a system will get done by someone, somewhere.  As long as we're free to do what we want to do, rather than being conned into doing something shitty because we feel forced to do so, or starve (or be homeless, or ostracized, or whatever).

This has nothing to do with money.  Money is irrelevant to basic needs.
Humans with no money at all still work and can create things that the world needs.  We've done it for millennia.  We're not total invalids.  We're at least as productive as all of the other species on the planet who are capable of taking care of themselves.
But when we don't allow some individuals the freedom to take care of themselves and others, due to some taking more than they need, then the whole system fails.

Save it for a bit while you decide what you are most likely to want/need in the future.
Think about things like education, housing/land (including things like camping gear for both exploring and as emergency back-up shelter), a really high quality bicycle, all kinds of tools, and even some books (reference books and how-to ones, especially) are the sort of things that are always more valuable when purchased as early as possible, and increase in value far faster than money.  Think about what you most want to do with your life (creating and/or exploring something awesome), and what you are most likely to need to make that happen, and then make a list.
So don't sit on that money for too long, but also don't spend it on stuff that you're not even going to remember in 10 years or more.
As far as *how* to spend it?  When you decide what you think is most important and valuable for the long term, then ask around where such things are sold, as well as in Bitcoin communities like this one, and see if anyone is willing to take Bitcoin in trade.  My guess is that these days a lot of folks would be happy to (I know I am!).

Interesting example of the different types of personality out there.  Your view of Bitcoin here indicates that you probably have a "fight" personality, where your natural response to life is to attack it and/or push things aggressively, so you focus on the bottom to top "recovery" section.  I have a "freeze" personality, where my natural response is to observe, study, and pay attention to creative, useful, fun opportunities.  So when I look at Bitcoin's relationship to US currency "value" I see the whole wave pattern that is the natural ebb and flow of all complex systems in life (in this case popularity of memes, in the scientific sense of the term).
The other two main brain types for humans are the "flight" type and the "flow" type.  
The flight type are more avoidant in their approach (heh) to life, where they tend to look to find ways to avoid the worst by withdrawing into themselves and studying the past to see "What went wrong?"  They would focus on the top to bottom downswing of the graph and assess the damage.
And, finally, the flow type are the super happy go lucky folks who approach life as a playful, creative, fun experience where they just manage to be successful in making most everyone happy.  (Nobody's perfect obviously, but they don't let that stop them from being pretty fuckin' good.)  They are probably the ones drawing the big red line on the logarithmic scale from 2011 to 2021 on [this graph]( and explaining why Bitcoin will be worth around a million US$ in just a couple of years, and probably being right.

I think that these folks have a lot of good ideas, but are missing the element of diversity and bottom-up, emergent processes being the way a healthy living ecosystem works.  
Rather than a centralized computer and carbon copy cities being the norm, we'll have what our animal bodies have, which is a wide range of different kinds of communities all connected together by a a very simple nervous system and circulatory system that is run locally, but connected globally.
Maybe blockchain technology will be a part of that nervous system, but maybe it will be something else.
What we are looking for is something that can bring information about what communities need, and want to offer (get rid of), so that resources can be effectively and easily directed to where they are most useful.  Then that system will find the best options for transporting those resources from where they are offered to where they are needed/useful.

You do need permission of the miners/developers to use Bitcoin.  That's sort of the whole point of it all: verification.  It's literally a permission granting system.  They grant you the permission to give/get Bitcoin if and only if you follow their rules.  It's no different than any other banking system in that sense.
The difference is in the way the authoritarians get to be authoritarians.  In a corporate bank, it's all about being hired by whoever is already there.  In a federal currency, it's about being elected or appointed by the people and/or their representatives.  In Bitcoin, it's about happening on some instructions and being able to get the equipment to develop/mine.

I downvoted and here're my reasons:
1. Complaining about someone else is not useful to us.
2. And doing it repeatedly is even less helpful.
3. These things get in the way of us actually talking about useful, interesting, diverse topics that help us learn something new so that we can better solve our problems of finding and creating the most awesome stuff in the universe.
The best way to deal with behavior you don't appreciate is to directly let those who are doing it know that it gets in the way of you being able to do something positive. (Specifically what DO you want to get help with, or share in the Bitcoin communities?)  And if that doesn't work, the next best thing is to apologize for bothering them and wander elsewhere.

Firstly, I'm a sis, not a bro.
And my point is that shorting, or longing (is that a thing? :-) is gambling, while investing involves putting your resources into something that will give you benefits even if all the resources are used up, or lost.
Actually getting Bitcoin is different from gambling on what it will do, because Bitcoin itself is a system that is creating value in the world by beta testing a voluntary, free, distributed, centralized (but democratically so) global resource tracking network.
Eventually, our planet needs a central nervous system, and I see Bitcoin's little experiment being the fetal stages of that.  So even if all the money that I've invested in it is lost, I've still invested well, based on my own ideals, of benefiting the world.
If I'd just gambled on what Bitcoin's exchange rate was doing, it wouldn't be an investment, because I wouldn't be helping Bitcoin at all.

My theory is the more wholistic version where, as with everything in the universe, things grow and then die.

But except for getting hit by a bus or swimming in flesh-eating-bacteria infested water, there is a fairly predictable pattern to the growth of different kinds of things.  And Bitcoin has a more natural growth pattern of a baby human right now, from what I can tell, which is exponential growth.
While centralized control over what we humans do, including with our basic needs such as shelter, is already dying...

Bitcoin is the free market/democratic/competitive, so it's not going to last in the future, where we will all be free to design our own approaches, tools, help, instead of being dependent on someone else to tell us what our options are and being limited to whatever is popular enough to stay around.
As for what you want, in a free system (NOT the "free market", which is anything but), you certainly will bump up against the laws of physics, and collective understanding about how to make stuff, but you won't be limited otherwise, due to authoritarian rule telling you what you can and can't have (and how much it will cost you).  You will be free.

Um, I think you're confused here.  The goal is not to make me happy.  The goal is to increase fitness of life as a whole.  Which is measured, in humans, by the neurochemicals that we call "happy".  So we know when we're doing things well by long term happiness, and we know we're fucking things up when we're not regularly happy.
The world naturally changes to make future generations happier than current generations.  So my goal is to do things that make me happy so that the children will be happier (and thus healthier and more fit).
And yes, we're all failures in some way.  Which is why we procreate.  In some way.  For me that's ideas mostly. With a bit of art and technology tossed in here and there.

Well, the other money is lost, yes, but you gained Bitcoin (which is also money).
 But my point was that if you have Bitcoin, you would only lose it if you sold it, or actually lost access to the wallet.  But as long as you still have the Bitcoin you haven't lost it.  If you sell at a time when the Bitcoin is worth less than you paid for it, then yes, you would have lost some money in the process.  But that would be silly, unless you invested more than you could afford to lose, and pulled out before the time was right to make some gains.
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:23:15
I think you are confusing competitiveness with risk-taking.  Men will do more stupid shit just to "impress" someone else, and gamble big when they get excited, but that's not the sort of risk taking that is useful to women.  Women are more calculating in their risk taking, and will risk a lot more than most men, but only IF it seems like a good bet.
Here's just one example of how this plays out:


@_date: 2018-06-26 13:17:24
I would suggest putting a little bit in at a time, over time.  This is long term investing here, not a quick get rich scheme (unless you get lucky).
I've been putting in extra money here and there over the past year and a half, at the lows and even sometimes at all time highs (like $1300!).  Obviously my investment has gone up incredibly high, and there were a few times I spent some Bitcoin, but mostly I'm still hodling.  I'm waiting to use it for something special, so I'm in no hurry.
As for trading, I would recommend you connect with friends and family and whatever to trade with, instead of going through middleman type exchanges.  The point of Bitcoin is that it's supposed to eliminate banks, and go peer to peer.  So find your peers who have Bitcoin and are willing to sell.

Obviously no one knows what makes any individual happy in any particular moment, but we certainly do know basic biology of what makes a body function well, which is the goal of life (more fitness, which is health).
And yes, of course I'm unhappy when myself and everyone around me is not having their basic needs met for even the most rudimentary physical health, let alone the higher levels of needs that Maslow identified for us over 50 years ago, which allow us to focus on larger challenges and solutions that serve whole communities and the planet itself.
Being free to procreate, in both the genetic sense and the memetic sense (making physical, emotional, intellectual, and/or philosophical creations with others) is definitely what life aims to do as a way to meet it's goals of increasing fitness.  Each new human, artwork, technology, culutural story takes the best stuff from it's parents and leaves behind the worst stuff, as natural selection weeds out the failures.


They have their own feedback chemicals.  As I said "in humans" health and increasting fitness is measured using the neurochemistry chemicals that we call "happy".


Yes, the neurochemistry can be fooled/hijacked to make you believe that you're increasing fitness, **temporarily**, through things like drugs, but obviously that's not lasting, and sooner or later you feel far worse.  And if you don't learn from that, you die.  Which is natural selection weeding out the failures (sucks if you are one of those failured, but that's how it works, as nature is always focused on the best for the whole, not any one individual).

Well, yes and no.  Obviously we all have a common set of rules we absolutely have to follow: the laws of physics.  Beyond that, though, we can either be free to do our own thing, or we can be subject to some third party rules.  (This is all aside from the whole idea of "free will" of course.)
Bitcoin is like the door with the bouncer.  If the developers/miners decide that they don't like the way you are doing things, they can boot you out of the system (again, see: Bitcoin Cash proponents/users, who were forced out of the Bitcoin system).  You absolutely have to do things the way they want, or you don't get to use your Bitcoin.  As I said, if you don't use your private key, or try to double spend, or want to use a different wallet type, or whatever, you won't get permission to use your Bitcoin, even if it legitimately is yours.
This is in contrast to a decentralized, free (actually permissionless and not involving a third party) system,  where you get to give your friend anything you have, directly.

outbid them! with: $9001
outbid both of them with an aggressively specific: $9,235

**(for the hyper win, by my judgment, given that when I looked at the price at some point this morning I saw it was exactly 10.00 mBTC on my phone app) with: 10,000**
but also,
**very reasonably, and equally winningly, said "I think it will be worth around $10k then. Honest/optimistic yet still realistic estimate I believe."**
then 
**with pretty specific prediction that is delightfully only $16 lower than the daily high (so far) of $10,266, for another wining prediction of: $10,250**

For advertising, I'd love to see us promote the original purpose of Bitcoin, which is a peer-to-peer way to trade money between individuals who know one another (are peers).
Could we advertise something about creating local Bitcoin clubs, to help people connect to one another, personally, so that they can offer and receive bitcoin for whatever kinds of exchanges they want to do?  Local businesses could sponsor or just join the clubs as well, so that folks in a community built up strong connections for using Bitcoin for normal business.
Also, the more we exchange Bitcoin with people we are closer to (than central exchanges and the strangers on them) the more we focus on making sure that exchanges are "fair" in the sense of not trying to only trade it away or spend when it's high, and just using it all the time, so that losses and gains are less pronounced, and folks are more comfortable using it all the time.
This is probably too much for just advertising, but maybe we could put together a little "how to form a Bitcoin club" website/video/flyer and then make ads to promote the idea.

If you think you need it, it's not spare money.
Bitcoin value will constantly change.  That's the one thing we know.
However, unless/until something really huge happens with the basic monetary system, it's very likely that Bitcoin will, *on average* continue to increase, exponentially, in value, compared to national currencies.  So if you want to save money for a while, I would indeed recommend putting at least some of it into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:44:07
Buy more, and HODL!  Until you have enough  Bitcoin to do something brilliant that you never could have otherwise.
That's what I'm going to do.  I mean, it helps that I invested mostly in 2017 and 2018, so I already have a lot more value than what I invested.  But I keep buying (and occasionally spending and giving away) and waiting.

The myth that genes are out to only make copies of themselves is so disturbing and unscientific.  It's astounding how this has been able to stick around for so long.  But then, again, evolution, even on a memetic level, is slow as hell.  Heh.
The goal of life (achieved through genes, memes, whatever) is to procreate the BEST combinations/patterns of instructions. NOT all combinations.  The goal is for patterns to constantly interact with the rest of the environment, including other sets of genes, memes, whatever, so as to find the instructions that are the most useful for increasing the fitness of life as a whole.  Preserving old patterns is the opposite of the goal.  
Random mutation and natural selection are the process of evolution, in any medium.  And those two things never preserve anything as a whole.  The process is to experiment and take the best of what shows up to make the new stuff.  
So, collaboration and altruism are the norm.  It takes a huge amount of random mutation to counteract that.  Which is what we've been seeing in our crazy experiment of money and life as a competitive point scoring game (money, grades, votes, etc.).  But, as with all memes, just like all genes, eventually the bad mutations go extinct.

LibertyX is what I've been using.  For buying $200 or less per day you only need the phone number.
The fees are variable, though they've been going up.  I started using them and there was a place that had a 3% fee, and now all I can find are 8% fee places.  And, of course, they also sell at a higher rate than the actual exchange rate.
But it's nice to be able to use cash or my debit card with a friendly face at the local computer repair shop that offers this service.

Also, on a random note, this guy is from MIT, and now there are basically no LibertyX locations in Cambridge (where MIT is) at all.

Governments can give when they are given to.  Voluntarily.  No forced taking necessary.
I don't think Marx and Engels saw this option.  But it's really the only option.


Firstly, we're talking about the definition of socialism here, so quoting Marx and Engels is kinda relevant.  So dismissing it is, on your part, either trolling, or really ignorant.  Which is normal.  So I'm not surprised.  Most of us have been brainwashed into not being able to think for ourselves, and just letting corporations and their governments tell us what to believe.
As for the past, and "refuting" the competitive, anti-social, psychopathic approach, and how it has gotten the planet where it is today, I'm happy to leave that all as obvious history.  We have made some gains, while destroying the planet, and torturing most humans into major mental illness.  So, yeah, there's that.
Thankfully, in the future, we're evolving away from that dinosaur approach.  The future is small, furry, and pro-social.  Which was the ultimate goal Marx and Engels had in mind with Communism.  Scaling up how our animal bodies function, with a decentralized, free system for all of the diverse individuals and species, collaborating because doing so is the most efficient (high fitness) approach to thriving.  In Communism you get to make up your own rules, rather than depending upon some centralized authority (laws) telling you what you can and can't do.  In Communism, as Marx and Engels imagined it, we're all free, and respected, rather than enslaved and treated like trash as we are now.

Normal statistics is one of averages, not extremes.  So, yeah, avoiding the peaks and dips is a good thing.  The outliers can be interesting and valuable to consider, but for long term investments, you want to aim for whatever the most stable growth is.  Which this set of data shows nicely.
Also, yes, all statistics are limited in scope.  Which is why the flyer very specifically reminds people to do their own research and not to invest more than they are comfortable losing.
And yeah, Bitcoin is more of a long term investment, or a short term gambling game.  Not really a day to day currency.  At least not yet.

Free markets are the same as democracies, with individuals "voting" for the "best" option for someone else to "lead" them.  For politics, that means voting for someone to tell them what the rules are that they have to obey, and for consumerism, that means voting for someone to tell them what kinds of products and services they can have.  And in both cases the competitive approach creates an atmosphere of cheating, lying, manipulation, and disrespect.
Only a collaborative, free, approach, where everyone gets to decide for themselves what rules they follow and what products and services they use, is healthy.  Which is where we're heading with a truly decentralized, creative, collaborative approach to life where we customize *everything* for ourselves, based on our own unique, specific set of skills, interests, and needs.
@_date: 2019-08-17 13:08:00
You're absolutely correct in pointing this out.
I guess most folks have never traveled or just generally been desperate to get cash and not have their own bank's system's ATMs around.
There is a private ATM at this big fair in Maine, in the middle of nowhere, so it's the only place to get cash for probably 20 miles or so, and maybe hundreds of thousands of people come through the fair.  I haven't used it in more than a decade but back then that ATM used to charge $2 per transaction I think, plus most banks would charge a fee for out of system withdrawals, so getting $20 would cost me like $24.  And that was a long time ago.  And I imagine the fair operators tried to get a better ATM company, so that the fairgoers would spend more money at the fair itself.

Are you trying to say that the second transaction request has a *fee* of it's own (but no actual transaction amount)?
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:32:20
Peer-2-peer is best.  Start or find a local Bitcoin group in your local community and trade directly with humans you know and generally feel like you can trust.  Don't look to make a profit off of them via fees, just look to trade when they want to trade, for both of your benefit.
Because sometimes we want to buy and sometimes we want to sell Bitcoin, based on our own current needs.  And using Bitcoin gives us more options, and helps build a stronger community, as well.

Democracy *is* centralized.  Centralization is having shared rules in a system.  Democracy is one way to generate those rules.  But not the only one.
And clearly there is no profit in Bitcoin.  Bitcoin itself is just a database.
Sure, you can use that database to try to get someone else to give you something else you might like, including US$ or UK£ or whatever.  But the ledger itself is just sitting there keeping track of some math stuff.  Moving furniture around.  There is no new furniture in Bitcoin's living room.
Anything new is outside of Bitcoin itself.  Which is, obviously, something many folks try to benefit from, and yes, obviously, the folks who got into the game early on benefit a lot from folks who want to get into the game later on.  That's just how currencies work.  Trading Bitcoin for profit is a fun game that some folks play, but you're free to play something else.  Like real life collaborative games where you create cool stuff with other folks, instead of competing against them.

@_date: 2019-08-06 16:50:53
For Bitcoin to become a norm, we have to start giving folks the option to use it as designed, from me to you, with no middleman website/exchange involved.
We can cultivate loose groups of friends, family, neighbors, small businesses, and such to trade with directly.  People we get to know and trust, at least for not disappearing with our money.  This way it won't take a whole lot of complex effort to trade Bitcoin.  Folks can just walk around the corner, visit with someone they know, and trade.  No greedy fees, no complex applications and approvals, no worrying about the middleman getting hacked, and very few fears of scams or higher powers deciding not to let you have your money.
Just honest to goodness peer to peer trading.

The pattern so far, and then a prediction based on it:
It's all about the (often unconscious/emotional) mental excitement of adding a new 0 to the exchange rate.  So growth ends up being exponential, around powers of 10.
Hit a power of 10 (going a bit above it), for a new peak, then drop to somewhere above the previous power of 10, then hit the higher power of 10 for the second time, and then peak pretty quickly to the *next* power of 10 for a new all time high.
So, we had 
First ATH: above $10  
New low: $3
Second ATH: above $100  
New low: $25
Third ATH: above $1000   
New low: $400
Fourth ATH: above $10,000  
New Low: $3000
Next will likely be:
Fifth ATH: above $100,000  
New low: $30,000
Sixth ATH: above $1,000,000  
New low: $300,000

OK, so you know how you keep score in a video game?  You have to do certain things to get points?  Well, all money is like that.  There are certain rules and actions that each different currency game has for generating their "points" and for exchanging those points.  Those rules are fairly subjective and arbitrary, but as long as most people agree on them, then those points will be valuable, at least to some people.
With the money that a government or independent bank (like the US Federal Reserve Bank) creates, they generate more points based on laws and regulations of those centralized governments and their banks, and generating $, £, ¥, etc. is usually related to how many points are borrowed by the banks' customers (credit).
With bitcoin, those points are generated by rules and regulations involving keeping all the scores in the bitcoin game up to date and as accurate as possible.  Rather than calculating and keeping these scores on a single computer or two, everyone who wants to (and has the resources to) keep track of the scores can do so, on their own computer/s.  And those who do this get paid a (very) small amount of bitcoin (points) every time they help out.  They can keep those points. trade them, or give them away, or lose them, if they forget where they put them or what the password is to get into their account.
(Also, unlike most banks, bitcoin accounts don't necessarily have anyone's name or other identity attached to them, just a complex code.  So you can even give your whole account to someone else, though that's not super common.)

The point is to get rid of the "middleman" of the merchants, and instead to do direct peer-to-peer trades.  We're talking about babysitters paying farmers for food, and farmers paying bicycle delivery folks for delivering things, and bicycle delivery folks paying a carpenter to build a shed for them, and the carpenter paying the babysitter, and so on.  We can entirely avoid mainstream banks this way, for almost all of our needs, making them mostly irrelevant.
And I'm not sure what you mean by "Circle is fine actually" or why you are referring to a newspaper article, because I'm talking about the huge changes to Circle that they have just enacted for all their accounts (clarified via email) where you can't exchange US$ for BTC anymore.

A contract is a religion.  Religion is literally just a shared belief in something.  The word means to join, basically, coming from the same root as ligament, the stuff that joins bones together.
Also, as an aside, using creative language when telling a story has nothing to do with ad hominem.  Ad hominem is used in a competitive debate, and is when you dismiss the individual speaking based on their personal character (looks, friends, name, ethnicity, etc.).  There is no debate here, and no one is calling any individual anything at all.

Basic Income (not unconditional, since that would never happen in a centralized government) is capitalism at it's peak.

I've always been frustrated with the description that you get rewarded for "doing difficult math problems" on your computer.

The point is that, as far as the real reporting has uncovered (as opposed to rumors and fake news) the social score ONLY applies to people who have been found guilty in court and haven't paid their fine, or who owe major debt and aren't trying to pay it off.  
We have this in the US.  I can't legally drive a car, because I have a court fine I didn't pay.  I used to have a low credit score because I defaulted on credit card debt, so I couldn't rent a place to live (easily) and I couldn't get a loan.  And, of course, there are many states where if you've been to prison, even if you're free, you aren't allowed to vote, get a job, rent a home, and lots of other things.

I'm not saying that they don't get attention and maybe benefit by getting some commission work, but in this case it doesn't matter.

That's the opposite of freedom.
We're enslaved now, in pretty much all countries.  If you can't choose what to do in life, and instead have to give your life over to some employer or otherwise compete for money to buy stuff that you need, then you're not free.  And now you also don't get to make your own rules, you have to be subjects of some authoritarian rule (created in some way, President, King, Dictator, whatever).

And if you store your passwords for anything, including your seed words or the actual private key itself, on additional devices, including paper, those are vulnerable as well.

The raw materials for everything we ever could need are already here, somewhere, probably pretty close by.  We just need the creative problem solving skills to make it.

There is no difference between what I'm talking about and what Bitcoin is now other than the total number that we can have.  The idea is that if it was a nice multiple of 10 we could see how much we have as a percentage of the total available, which never changes.  Right now, it's a weird calculation because the total number is 21,000,000.  So to get the percentage we need a calculator.
1 Bitcoin is worth X percentage of all Bitcoin no matter what.  That's not how it works with unstable/growing currencies where they create new money whenever they want.  That's my point.

What are you doing here?  What purpose are you hoping to achieve by being in the Bitcoin community?

It's a good plan to not waste your life (time) ever.  Just do what you love to do, and make the world a better place by your natural instinct to create and explore the most awesome stuff in the universe.
Anything else is just making your life, and everyone else's, worse.
But it's hard to trust yourself, and allow yourself to be free when you've been sold a whole fuckton of propaganda trying to get you to repress your dreams, and a whole lot of deficiencies in the resources you need to work effectively on those dreams.
But know that some of us are working to help you get those resources, unconditionally, so you can be free and awesome in some unique way, like nature designed you to be.

Compared to investing that money in something that is beneficial, like a community supported agriculture program, in your example, betting on random fluctuations is pretty silly.  I mean, it's amusing as a game if you're really bored, but it's not a useful way to use your resources, if you have any actual goals in life.  Bet on something that will give you value *even if* it takes all of your money.  Investing in a CSA will support your local farmer even if they lose their crop, so that next year they still want to grow food for you.
Investing in bitcoin gives me value because I see the algorithms and networking capacity being valuable in even more interesting ways in the near future, as a way to keep track of and direct resources from wherever they are created to wherever they are useful, so our planet can flourish.  Even if I lose all my US$ investment.

You give your power away willingly when you let others tell you how to spend your resources and what to do with your life.
Yes, it's challenging to find ways to get your needs met without trying to appease certain individuals and groups, but it's still your choice what to do with your life.  You can spend it feeding the sick machine, or trying to build a real, resilient, collaborative community of like-minded souls.
If you are literally in prison, that's definitely taking away some of your power, but as long as you can speak, and share your stories, with anyone, you still have power to honor your ideals in some meaningful way.

The pattern so far, and then a prediction based on it:
Hit a power of 10 (going a bit above it), for a new peak, then drop to somewhere above the previous power of 10, then hit the higher power of 10 for the second time, and then peak pretty quickly to the *next* power of 10 for a new all time high.
So, we had 
First ATH: above $10  
New low: $3
Second ATH: above $100  
New low: $25
Third ATH: above $1000   
New low: $400
Fourth ATH: above $10,000  
New Low: $3000
Next will likely be:
Fifth ATH: above $100,000

You have the same power as all other humans.  
If you find others who want the same kind of community as you do, then combine your powers to make it happen.
We give up our power when we let others tell us what to do.  But we have the power to choose.
We can take back our power in baby steps, if that feels most comfortable, by spending more and more of our time doing what we love, for free, as much as possible.  The more we do that, the more we will start making connections to others, and we can all mutually help one another get our needs met, away from the centralized corporations and governments.

You're confused here.  I'm not sure how else to explain it to you.  But the reality is that whatever device that you get the seed words from and enter into has to be connected to the blockchain somehow.  It might not be direct, but then nothing on the internet is direct, really.
So your comment about not getting the seed words anywhere near anything connected to the internet is meaningless.  Even with a hardware wallet it has to be connected to the internet somehow.  Otherwise it's not going to interact with the blockchain, and you won't get any Bitcoin transactions.

Also, on a side note, your math with a square foot of housing being 1₿ is a little off, given the fact that Bitcoin is limited to a quantity far, far less than the number of square feet in housing already in existence, and even far, far less than the number of humans...

Yes, that's a lovely scam, when you've bought into the lie that money is more important than life and freedom.
Being homeless is the most fucked up thing we do to humans, and if it never happens to you, please be grateful for that blessing.  
If you have your own housing, legally, you've got a layer of protection that could save your life.  It doesn't matter if that property is "investment" property or not, as long as it's legally yours and you can live there if you choose to do so.
Also, it's absolutely ludicrous that anyone thinks that renting is cheaper than owning.  Unless you're taking advantage of some kind person's generosity and getting very low rent relative to the market rate, you're paying for them to profit.  Which is why renting out property is one of the biggest profiteering businesses in the world.

I'm not quite sure how anyone could lose money in Bitcoin.  There was only a small window of time when it was above the current exchange rate.  Like a few months.  So it would only be if you bought most of your Bitcoin in those few months, and then sold recently that you'd have lost anything.

If I pay you Bitcoin for whatever work you do for me, you need to be able to pay me back for whatever work I do for you.

Selling is complicated as hell.  Buying is bad enough, so I'm mostly going to keep it in, if only for that reason.  Secondly, selling gets you involved with taxes.  No point in messing around with that if I'm not actually ready to be done with the investment.
But also, everyone selling lowers the value.  And while I'm ok with buying more when it's low, my goal is to have it go way up, so that I can actually use it for something really meaningful to my life.

Just FYI, Bitcoin is indeed centralized.  It's controlled by the developers, Satoshi (via the original code/idea), and the miners, mostly.  It's a voluntary system, though, instead of being one governed by invitation only (like banks/corporations/national-governments).
So you could say that Bitcoin's labor is decentralized, but it's control is absolutely centralized.

That's an interesting point.  A currency shouldn't automatically lose value just because you're using it (giving it to someone else, or receiving it).  But then that should be the same for an asset.

It's not a big point I'm making, as I said it just seems like a missed opportunity, given Bitcoin's strengths as a stable currency (where banks/governments can't just create more whenever they want).
Thinking about the percentage we have of the whole is a slightly more realistic way of measuring our scores relative to others.
It's like cake.  If I have half of the cake (50%) that automatically means that everyone else *combined* has half, then it's easy to see that I'm gonna get way more fat than everyone else.  If I say I have *one* **BILLION** *dollars*, that would have been (something around) 50% sometime in the 1800s, but now it's around 1/3000th, or about 0.033%.

There is no owner of the ledger, and there is no company, it's just a database that we call "the ledger".  Bitcoin itself never increases in the number of Bitcoins it has.  It just moves bits around within the system, like rearranging furniture in your living room periodically.
There are folks who volunteer to do work to keep the ledger up to date, and they get added to a lottery to be included in the ledger as a small gift for doing so.
There is a centralized governance of how the ledger is calculated and what the rules are for the lottery, and that's democratically run, of course (well, democratic with some meritocracy and aristocracy, to some extent, as voting requires some kind of resources, either running a miner, or a node, or being a developer, or finding someone on the ledger to give you some of their claim to their chair, or table, or some other bit of furniture in the room.

I am an organismist, for a lack of a better word (though it's a great word, in my opinion), which is where the whole planet evolves to be a healthy, thriving organism, where each individual is free to be themselves, doing what they love to do (based on their unique genes and current situation), and being free to take what they need, to function well, from their environment.
This is a collaborative and free system, with no money, no voting, no coercion, no greed, and instead just a creative, healthy, fun approach to life, with resources freely flowing from where they are created (voluntarily) to where they are needed/wanted/recyclable, instead of being hoarded and clogged up uselessly somewhere getting wasted, while individuals get sick and malfunction and are, themselves, wasted.
Bitcoin, as I see it, is a way to transition from a "stable" steady state, Newtonian approach to society, to the free one of a dynamic, chaotic, fun, creative one.  Bitcoin is showing the world how ridiculous money is as a way of life, with it's total disconnect from any real value.  It's literally just numbers.
In the meantime, I'm using Bitcoin to fund a non-profit program that aims to use the creative efforts of artists, techies, and educators to use the resources a community already has in abundance to serve the needs of the community, directly, for free.

That's exactly what I mean.

Yes, this is nature driving us via evolution, as it pulls us forward.  We're literally born to be awesome.  But we repress it to play the stupid Monopoly game, which keeps us primitive and backwards, technologically and culturally.

In most of the places I've worked, the highest employees (presidents, managers, etc.) often got in the way of productivity way more than helping it.  When they were on vacation for a while, things went much more smoothly.
The thing is that if you are there because you want to be there, and care about what you are doing, as opposed to being there because of gluttonous amounts of money that you might feel crazy to refuse, as the Twitter discussion here points to, then you are going to be a very different sort of worker.

Ok, think about it this way.  You want to design something, either a way of life, or a tool, or a way that someone else does something (for you).  There are two ways you can go about this.  Either you can do it yourself, based on what you actually want, or you can hope that some authority will do it for you, in some way that is at least close to the way you want it, *but* because everyone else is also asking for their own lifestyles, tools, and help, there is a democratic/mob-rule/popularity contest that wins out, for the most part, and you end up having to settle for whatever the authorities are making.
If you are actually free and not dependent on some authority, via some kind of voting process, either money or elections or comments or upvotes or whatever, then you get to just design it yourself, either from scratch, or using free designs that already exist that you can tweak to your exact specifications, for free.
I don't know about you, but the latter is the only way I want it to go.  I don't want my products, services, or lifestyle to be determined by what is popular, or average.

As I said, if you want to "lose" money, you, and everyone else, would be better off if you just donate it.  It's silly to intentionally invest money if you expect to take it out before you've made a return on it.  But you do you.


My profession is culture hacking, I guess, which has nothing to do with money.  I'm trying to use universal patterns of growth to find better ways to take care of our planet, and all of us animal, vegetable, and mineral Earthlings, well enough to help us achieve planetary procreation (making "baby planets" essentially).
As far as Bitcoin investing, I'm just in it because it seemed like a far better way to store some funding that was donated to me than national currencies were.

What is "real money"?  And why would we want any, anyway.
Money is just a tool for exploitation and manipulation.  It's a way to get people to do things that go against their nature (evolution), which is clearly the worst thing.  We need to respect our natural drives as (potentially) intelligent social animals, to create, explore, and share awesome stuff that improves life for future generations.
Money makes us go backwards, bribing us to be uncreative, incurious, and greedy.

Bitcoin's governance structure is a combination of a participatory democracy and a meritocracy, with a smidge of corporatocracy (since more money gets you more power at least for nodes/miners).

When talking about governance and systems theory, a centralized system is about shared rules that everyone follows, regardless of how those rules are decided.  It can be direct democracy, representative democracy, meritocracy, totalitarian, or whatever.
A decentralized system has no shared rules.  Everyone does their own thing, and any collective behavior is emergent (unpredictable from the individual parts).  So, art would be a decentralized system, since anyone can make art any way they want.  Human brains are decentralized too, with each sense sending data into different neurons in the cortex and being recombined to form interpretations, which then get combined into whole thoughts.
US currency is a combination of representative democracy and meritocracy (ideally).  Bitcoin is similar.  With Bitcoin, the node runners get to vote on proposed changes by developers, and users get to vote on whether they want to buy or sell.  With US$ we have the three-part elected (democratic) and appointed (meritocratic) system of legislature, supreme court, and president generally directing the Federal Reserve, who are hired (meritocracy).  But with Bitcoin it's obviously global, so there is more diversity, which helps, or not, depending on your perspective.

New low: $25
Third ATH: above $1000   
New low: $400
Fourth ATH: above $10,000  
New Low: $3000
Next will likely be:
Fifth ATH: above $100,000  
New low: $30,000

I think they were trying to say that the listed exchange rate is higher than the real trading value on some exchanges.  I know that the two I've used most definitely have a dramatically higher current value listed as compared to the more neutral listings we see on websites that average many different exchange prices or however they are doing it.  So when I'm buying, I'm definitely paying more than whomever is selling, and I presume that the exchange is taking that as an undeclared (to me) profit.

The key is that it's a percentage, rather than a free floating number.
This is a good beginning for a future economy where we rate value subjectively based on what we, personally, prioritize, based on our unique needs for what we most want to get from the world and most want to give to the world.
This percentage rating will let a global resource tracking system, probably based on a blockchain model, as tested by Bitcoin, match specific output needs with input needs effectively.
For example, if I have apple trees in my yard, and I have way too many for me and the local folks to eat before they rot all over the yard, I'll rank giving them away as a high priority as soon as the apples start falling.  Maybe I say that it's 70% important to me, relative to the things that are more and less important to me at the time.  Then, if you love making apple cider, you might rank your input need for apples at something like an 80% priority request, and then if the algorithm sees that we're close enough to have those apples picked up and transported by someone who has some priority for traveling from my place to yours at least now and then, it might automatically arrange for the apples to get from me to you via our traveling neighbor.  Of course, there would usually be some oversight on the humans' part as far as making sure it's still possible, but the transaction would have been arranged, at least, based on the numbers, rather than some complex negotiation and searching like we tend to do now when we want to give and receive things.  That's because more realistic real values of giving and receiving are built into the system as subjective percentages, rather than some kind of attempt at a universal "value" of apples and money and shipping work.

Bitcoin is, as all currencies are, centralized.
Centralized means having the same rules apply to all participants.  Centralized rules can be decided any way, from democratic, to meritocratic, to totalitarian, to plutocratic, to lottery, and anything else.  But the shared trait of all centralized systems, if we're talking literal systems theory/math, is that all individuals have the same rules (if they don't obey them they will get kicked out, or punished, which, clearly happens with Bitcoin as doublespenders get punished and non-consensus losers are forced to fork off).
A decentralized system is like art, or our animal bodies, where everyone does their own thing, and there is no central, shared agreement.

The planet is about to pivot from being what is essentially a human society raging a civil war against the rest of the Earhtlings to being a collaborative, creative, healthy whole.
Money is the primary weapon of that "civil war", in that it provides an artificial motivation to harm our planet and one another, either by directly destroying life on Earth, or by indirectly enslaving ourselves in jobs that go against our best interests and natural desires to create and explore awesome stuff in the service of life.
Bitcoin and other more democratic/chaotic forms of money are a transitional experiment to try to detach money from it's more big-government type approach, but in the end, like all other rebellions, it will fail because in fighting the enemy it has to become the enemy.
But, out of ashes, will emerge an infrastructure, the blockchain, global network of miners, nodes, and developers, and concept of a resource tracking system that can help create the planet's first truly effective nervous system for finding and directing resource needs and offers, freely, just like a smaller healthy organism does with it's nerves and brain.

Money, and other competitive games, will always create a concentration of power.  That's it's entire purpose.  Compete to overpower others and win while they lose.
This is the worst ideology humans ever came up with.  And, like the dinosaurs of old, the competitive approach for human society will go extinct for the most part (with small outliers turning into pretty birdlike memes of competitive creative games, making art to entertain the world).
A global nervous system (the internet) is finally allowing us to collaborate and solve our shared problems, instead of competing against ourselves and the rest of the planet.
I see Bitcoin as the last gasp of the dying meme, and as the beta testing for a non-competitive global resource tracking database, so that we can easily offer and request resources, freely, so that everyone can get what they need to flourish, unconditionally.  Like a library combined with Amazon, free to all, with most everything we ever want, and everything we absolutely need.

Right.  Bitcoin is run by a group.  The rules aren't decentralized, and instead are governed by the creator, developers, and miners who vote for the centralized rules that everyone has to abide by.
If you don't abide by the rules, you get kicked out of the system, or whatever.
Yes, the labor is decentralized in Bitcoin, unlike in a national currency or bank.  But the rules are centralized.  It's a democracy.  Whoever "wins" the most votes gets to define the rules for everyone else in the system.
A decentralized government system would welcome different rules, so that anyone could participate, no matter what they were doing.  Art is a good example of a decentralized system, where anyone can make art in any way they want, and do anything with the art once they are done making it.  There is no centralized governance in art, telling you what kind of art you can make and how you can use it.

Because I define it as a bottom-up, emergent, chaotic, natural, free-flowing system, where there is no centralized governance/laws.
There is no human society level socialist government, since it probably wouldn't even be called a government by most people.  But it is how we share memes.  Communication is a socialist/communist system.  No central rules, just individuals sharing freely, for the benefit of all.

Yes, reality is nuts, when you have been taught things like the Earth is flat.
Socialism is a temporary transition between competitive life (slavery for all, via centralized/authoritarian power, be it democratic, meritocratic, plutocratic, or whatever making the rules all must follow or be punished) and collaborative life (freedom for all, and a decentralized system, which is chaotic, and emergent, and healthy as in your own animal body, where all of the diverse cells and species have a shared goal of being healthy and free to do whatever the heck they most love to do).  
Communism, as Marx and Engels imagined it would be a healthy, free, decentralized system, and Socialism was sort of half authoritarian and half decentralized, as things evolve. 
This is where we're heading now.
@_date: 2019-10-29 23:41:43
Bitcoin is the same competitive game as other currencies, which makes us dependent upon the centralized system to get us what we need to function, through harming others.

There is no Godlike individual in control of these things, in my awareness.
Genetically, blue skies trigger certain biological reactions in my body that allow me to feel different ways than when the skies are black or grey, given that I'm a diurnal animal, who has no feathers or fur to protect her from rain, which is signaled by grey skies.
I can still change my mood if other, more life-supporting things are happening in and around me, of course, since night and rain aren't the end of the world.  And, obviously, having shelter is one of those things.  So I'm happier when the world allows me to have a shelter.  I can certainly do things that affect my happiness, but I'm obviously not in control of what is done to me by outside forces.

I, Marx and Engels, and Ray Kurzweil (also not millennials) are talking a system where all are free to be themselves, to make their own choices, and to be supported in living whatever sort of lifestyle they want, since all individuals have the same, shared, goal of being healthy and creating and exploring the best stuff in the universe:

Until then, feel free to sell your Bitcoin at a loss, or whatever, at this low price, and people like me will happily buy it and hodl until we have enough to do something cool that we never could have before.

Money is never an "actual thing".  Money is just a way to score points in a game.  It doesn't matter whether we're talking about $, £, ¥, bitcoin, or any other form of currency, it's all just imaginary numbers that some people agree to place value on.  We could all just as easily decide that these numbers are entirely meaningless, and instead just be free.  But most humans are not quite ready to give up on the money game just yet, so we'll keep playing for a while, until we finally choose to play a different game.

Of course they can.  If you don't follow their rules, you don't get to use it.  You have to ask for permission, and if they don't think you are doing what they want you to do, then you get booted out of the system.  (See: Bitcoin Cash.)
In a system that is truly free and decentralized, where you don't need permission of a third party, you could just give your friend whatever you had, directly.  You could give them that apple, book, or whatever you already owned.
With Bitcoin, if you don't sign in with your private key, for example, or try to "double spend" or just use some wallet of your own invention that doesn't quite fit with the centralized (democratically voted) rules, then you don't get to give your friend your Bitcoin, even if it really is yours.

Yes, and the hardware wallet has to be connected to the internet to pass the transaction onto the blockchain.  
There is no way around this.
The device you're using to generate and then read the seed words as you get them and then input them again must be connected to the internet at some point, or there could be no transaction.
However, writing down the seed words on a computer file to store them for yourself, even temporarily, is indeed a very bad idea.

2.

Right now it's just raw land (with that one odd shed).

Security is this crazy, unhealthy addiction to a dystopian "fantasy", caused by a lethal viral meme of life as a Monopoly game.
Technology is now available for humanity to flourish with a beautifully abundant global circulatory system, where all individuals have unconditional access to our physical needs, so that we can be as healthy — mentally and physically — as possible.

So, you're letting the authoritarian psychopathic propaganda of the USSR, China, and the USA to define the term socialism.
Got it.
I'm using Marx and Engels and the folks they based their ideas on to define socialism (and communism, which is the real deal, rather than socialism which is a transition state).  In the original, healthy meaning, communism was a decentralized, natural, free-flowing system where everyone makes their own decisions, and is a supported part of the whole, because everyone in the system has the same goal of being happy and healthy, rather than of trying to make more money than their neighbors, family, friends, strangers, etc. in some insane global game of Monopoly.

You know "communism" has buying and selling goods and services in a market, too?
And selling things is the opposite of collaboration.  It's a competitive thing, where I hold my work ransom, and try to extort money from you in exchange, instead of me just being free, like all other species in nature do.  My use of money enslaves me and forces me to see you as a competitor, rather than a fellow Earthling.

Yeah, the next serious "correction" will only come after we hit $100,000 exchange rate.
The pattern is hitting the exponential once, then dropping to somewhere a bit above the previous exponential, then hitting the new exponential again, but for realzies this time.  Repeat.
We hit above $10, then dropped to above $1.  Then hit $10 again, and leveled off.  
Then hit $100 and dropped a bunch to (well) above $10, then hit and leveled off at above $100.  
Then hit $1000 and dropped a whole bunch (for a long time) to above $100, then hit $1000 again and leveled off.
Then we had a fun time hitting over $10,000 (wheeee!) and then dropped to well above $1000, and now we're getting ready to go above $10,000 again to level off there for a bit before we go to $100,000.

The central authority of Bitcoin Starts with Satoshi, then moves out to the developers, then the node runners and miners, then the users, who generate the rules that everyone has to abide by, or leave Bitcoin (as in double spenders, or forks).
I'm not sure how folks don't see the central, top-down, authority of Bitcoin.  It's just so obvious to me.
And all centralized systems have a central authority.  Not a nation, necessarily, because it could be anything, not just a collection of humans.  My computer has a central authority, as it has a central set of rules (the operating system) that all of it's processes has to follow.

I'm sorry someone told you that you are not "in any position to talk" about anything you have an opinion on.  That's gotta fuck you up.
And, I'm also sorry that you believe that anyone today is close to thriving.  It's amazing how deep the brainwashing has gone, that humans look at themselves and one another and think, "They're doing well!", or, worse, "They have all that they need, they *should* be happy." when the reality is that our bodies are so incredibly repressed and deficient and bombarded with toxins, that it's amazing we can do anything at all.  (Though most humans do a whole lot of drugs just to "get by", from coffee to alcohol to cigarettes/vaping to tylenol to a whole drug store full of compensatory chemicals, and street drugs, for extra measure.)
But once we are free, that will all change.  This switch from the lizard-like meme of life as a competitive game to life as a collaborative, pro-social, playful, creative, curious game will make the difference between the age of the dinosaurs and the human industrial age.

When Bitcoin is low, buy some for near-future spending.  Then, when you need to buy something, and when Bitcoin is a bit higher than when you bought it (hopefully), spend it.  Repeat until you get paid in Bitcoin, and don't have to exchange other currencies for it.

Presidents are authoritarian.  I'm for freedom, decentralization, and a flourishing life.
Here: 
And a communist system has no parties.  Just people, doing what they want, freely.  Just like all natural systems, like our animal bodies and all of the 10,000 different species, work, with no central authority (laws) that all have to follow.
I know that it's weird to those who've been trained to think that authoritarian/centralized governments is the only option.  You'll get to see how it works soon enough, though, as the competitive/anti-community system meme goes extinct like the genetic dinosaurs of old.

@_date: 2019-08-29 13:37:30


I was.
There's a pattern.   It's not super tight, but it's fairly predictable.  It is related to 10x prices (because we use a base 10 number system, and humans like adding zeros to the end of their monetary scores), and when we hit an all time high of a new 10x level, we go a bit above, and then drop down to somewhere above the previous 10x for a while, and then eventually climb back up to hit the higher 10x again for the second time and linger around there for a while (which is what's happening now), until shooting way up to the next 10x for a crazy new all time high (which is $100,000 this time around).

I don't quite understand how this isn't obvious.
It's extremely simple.
If the exchange rate is notably lower than the recent average, then that's a dip.  If it's higher than the recent average, then it's a peak (either locally, or all time).
Don't buy at an all time high, unless you're happy to wait for many years for it to go back up.
Buy whenever the exchange rate is lower than the recent average, and, overall, you'll most likely do well, if you hodl for at least a little while.

This is how you can explain Bitcoin to any newbie of any age, in a way that gives the whole idea of currencies a bigger picture perspective in the grand scheme of human society in the past few millennia:  
Some human decided to make a new game where there are points you can collect.  It's like the game with (fill in the blank local national currency), only in this case, instead of a company or government deciding what the rules of the game are, this individual human was the one to do it, and he decided to do it mostly on computers, where those who play the game keep track of the scores for everyone.  They call the computer files that keep track of the scores a "ledger" like the old paper notebooks that humans used to keep track of scores before they had computers.  Eventually, a lot of other humans decided to play the game, and now the game is popular all around the planet.  Anyone who has a computer and can figure out what the rules are, can play, though some kinds of play are very complicated and require very fancy computers.  Some humans even get together to make whole buildings full of fancy computers to get as many points as they can.
The original way to get points was to help everyone playing keep track of the points that everyone playing has, using computers.  But now you can also get points by finding someone who already has some points and giving them other kinds of things, including points from other games like (the local currency), or stuff or favors in trade, or even sometimes they will give you to them for free, like a gift.
One of the important parts of the game is having a secret code of numbers, letters, or words, which they call the "key".  If someone else gets your key, they can take your points.  So players are very careful to hide those keys in different ways.
There is really no goal in the game other than to collect points.  So it's not that interesting a game, but you can sometimes use your points to trade for fun and useful stuff, and because humans change the value of the points, compared to other points and things, you can sometimes get a lot of cool stuff for very few points.  So that's where most folks find the fun in the game.  Those who get really into the game also have fun working on the rules and finding interesting ways to change them a little bit, or a lot.  But they can't just change the rules the way they want, as most everyone else has to agree to play by any new rules.  So they don't change too often.
Also, the folks who like this game sometimes like to compete against other games, and say that their game is better, especially since anyone who wants to play, or help make the rules is allowed to do so, as long as they can figure out how, and can get a good enough computer.  Most other money games don't let just anyone make the rules or keep track of the score.  So that's something different for the players to do, which some of them really like.

Well, your math is very different in your universe I guess.
And the lack of inequality of access to the resources one needs to be healthy and do the creating and exploring work that one naturally wants to do in life, freely and honestly, is impressive in your universe as well.
In my universe for me to gain money, someone else has to lose it, and they rarely want to, making it a sacrifice on their part, mostly due to the reality that there is a hugely ineffective, competitive, economy in the human society here, meaning that most humans can't get even their basic needs reliably, and are regularly mentally and physically ill, leading to all kinds repression, forced labor (agreed upon under written and unwritten threats of even more harm to themselves and/or loved ones) which makes life even harder than it needs to be, given all the plentiful resources the Earth we have contains.
Your universe must be so much healthier than mine.  Though the tedious keeping score seems just as insanely wasteful, when life really could just be free, for all, when everyone chooses to value their own unique goals for creating and exploring cool stuff that serves life, for someone, somewhere.

Well, I'm hoping money tanks, since it's the root of all evil, and all.
But not being able to get one's basic needs (food, shelter, transportation, education, etc.) is what promotes "laziness" (which is more clinically called depression).
Basic income is the allowance that allows you to go out there and be a human in the monetary game.  Like how in Monopoly the game only goes on because everyone gets money every time they pass go, so they can continue to feed the property owners, and they can keep getting richer.  It's only when the losers realize how lame the game is, and how anti-social the greedy property-owners are being that they finally choose to stop playing and find something more creative, collaborative, fun, and productive to do with their lives.

A decentralized system will emerge out of the ashes, so to speak, of the overpowered center of top-down power, for the planet, as we individuals stop supporting/obeying the central rules, and start just doing what we love, for free, because it's so much more fun and meaningful than competing against ourselves for whatever artificial "reward" points the central system offers us (money, grades, votes, likes, etc.).

A "peer" connection is a direct connection between me and you.  This is different from the common third party "trusted" connection where you and I use an intermediary individual or group to help make the transaction happen.
Bitcoin's whole purpose was the me to you connection directly.  I send some quantity of Bitcoin to you directly from my account to yours.  The only middleman involved is the centralized Bitcoin system itself (the rules for calculating the ledger, and the ledger itself).
Your suggestion here adds a third party between me and you.  So, instead of you giving me your wallet address for me to donate you, you're asking someone else to do it for you.  It's wasteful to add another level of complexity to the process of moving money between us.  
Even if you're running a large non-profit, it's better to do the donation asking and monitoring in-house, on your own servers, than to trust some fairly unknown third party to do it for you.

The magic fairy tale land of free flowing matter and energy is the one where entropy (evolution) is the rule of law.
Things naturally are taken apart, and then recombined into new, more complex, fun, interesting things.  
And we can't ever do nothing.  The universe is always flowing.  And we're a part of that.  Taking in resources, reorganizing them, and outputting new resources.  All living organisms create more complexity (higher entropy) outputs than non-living things, but even they move from simple to complex, as suns generate chemicals which coalesce into plants, which become animals like us, which create computers and rocket ships, and so on.

The basic pattern is that the all time highs are just above 10X (so $10, then $100, then $1000, etc.), then dropping to somewhere above the previous ATH, then going to that new ATH again, and then jumping to somewhere above 100X for a new ATH.
So somewhere in the $200,000 range seems quite reasonable.  Then dropping to even $30,000 is within the norm, before going up above $100,000 and then $1,000,000 after a while.

Because people aren't going to want to sell, or be able to sell, so they rent instead.  So... more rentals available.
And those who are selling will have to sell for less, because folks can't afford crazy prices.
Rents would mostly stay the same, since they are already insanely high.
And maybe, just maybe, more folks would pool their money to buy shared housing.  Housing coops might become the norm.

If you want to get more Bitcoin, someone else has to lose some.
That's competitive, the opposite of collaborative.
Just do the math, to see.  If it's zero-sum, where there is zero growth in an interaction, then it's competitive.  If the system increases all parties' values, then it's a collaboration.
The purpose of Bitcoin is to show humanity the insanity of competing against one another for resources, while giving us the technology to actually keep track of real value for individual needs, so that resources can be moved from where they are not wanted to where they are needed or at least useful.
Here's a bit of an explanation:

The length of time we take to make it through a cycle (1X to 1/3X to 10X, essentially) is random.  It's taken as little as a few months, and it's taken as long as three years.
So, yeah, it could be a long time before we hit a $100,000 exchange rate, but it seems more likely that it will be much shorter, given the political climate and Bitcoin's increasing popularity.  But, there's really no way to know.
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:05:28
Normally, when dealing with two different currencies, the buyer tends to send a bit extra to cover changes in the exchange rate.
When my husband and I bought land in another country, we did this with the check my husband had made out by the bank, since these things normally take days to go through.

Yes, I know decentralized systems (chaotic) can seem scary.  But that's what they are.  Which is why Bitcoin doesn't use that approach, because folks want something reliable and stable and centralized, with a single set of rules for how, when, where, etc. Bitcoin is generated and allocated.
What you're thinking of is that Bitcoin is a bit more democratic (or really meritocratic) than national/bank currencies.

@_date: 2019-06-06 16:29:01
Yes, systems are governed.  A centralized system has a central set of shared rules that all who use the system obey.  In Bitcoin, that's the core code and the ledger, which govern how/when Bitcoin is generated and allocated.
In a decentralized system there is no shared/centralized set of rules, and everyone choose freely how to behave, creating things whenever and however they want.  Bitcoin is the opposite of this, with extreme centralization, as the most solid and define set of rules of any large currency out there.  Which is why there are forks, as even the slightest change of rules boots people out of the system.
@_date: 2019-10-12 21:17:42
The IRS doesn't tax Bitcoin, they tax profits/income, regardless of how you got it.
If you keep your investment for at least a year before selling it or buying something with it, even if you've made a profit, as long as you earn less than just under $40,000 a year, total income, then you have a 0% tax on your Bitcoin gains. If you hold for less than a year, or earn more than that, then you pay capital gains (and are clearly rich, and maybe want to scale back and live a little, instead of making more and more money. :-)

A lot of us don't even pay attention to fees.  The goal is increasing Bitcoin's use, so even if the fees are a little high, it's worth it.

Everyone is ignoring the reality that YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY ANYWAY!
Spend and replace has a goal of getting more national currency into Bitcoin, and of making Bitcoin a more normal form of currency.
Take some of the national currency money that you're planning to spend in the future and convert it to Bitcoin.  Then spend the Bitcoin on what you actually need/want to buy.  Ideally in a slightly favorable way, of course.
You might lose a little bit of "value" or you might gain some, but the more we do this, the more common Bitcoin will become as a normal currency.
It makes little sense to not do this, really, as long as you have a reasonably easy and cheap way to convert to Bitcoin.

Here's a modern version of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that I've created, to help folks see how getting what humans need at a lower level (physical and emotional needs, which Maslow called deficiency needs) allows the brain to function as designed, with higher consciousness, and a motivation to serve all life, rather than just the body and immediate family/friends.  Without those bottom needs, we're just snakes, really.

Fractional Reserve Banking is irrelivent here.

We're talking about how systems are organized/governed, and how the different elements within them are controlled.

I'm still planning to make an educational video about centralized and decentralized systems, but it's more work than I have the energy for, especially with my current situation, and other projects that are a bit higher in priority.

Bitcoin is centralized.  It's just that the central rules are democratic and open source, rather than whatever your various national currencies/banks are.
(In a decentralized system there is no central rule for how everyone does things, and everyone has their own, unique, rules.  So the field of currencies as a whole is decentralized, but each one is centralized around a shared set of governance about how they are created and allocated.)

I have read the FAQ and introduction and TOS and instructions, multiple times, and I have downloaded it as well.  So this isn't FUD, this is a description of what Bisq is.  
They are a third party middleman, where you have to download software before you can trade with anyone else.  Rather than just finding someone you want to trade with on your own, wherever and whenever you find someone in normal life (the legitimately decentralized approach).  This is fine, but good to know.  It's not like Craigslist, where you can just look for someone making an offer to buy or sell, it's software you have to download to do the exchange.
And then the Bisq organization acts like a bank, or some other "safe keeping" or "authority" type party, with the goal of protecting buyers and sellers, so before you can trade with others, you have to give them money:




Where Bisq *is* decentralized and peer-to-peer is in how the platform functions, similar to Bitcoin's ledger, as it is distributed over the whole network of users, rather than being hosted on a single server.  Even the security deposit is held in a multi-party contract, rather than a centralized account.  (Though there is a single arbiter.)
Oh, one last odd thing, they sometimes only talk about males using Bisq, for some strange reason.

If living organisms had no natural motivation to thrive, life would have ceased to exist from the get go.
The reality of biology is that all organisms are naturally built, by evolution, to need to create and explore the best stuff in the universe.
And if you've ever played with little kids, you'd see how obvious this is.  They have far more energy to do cool, productive, stuff than most any adult, who's been brainwashed into repressing their natural urges.
Also, this is what Marx and Engels had to say about that weird logic;




And while some monetarily wealthy humans do slide into hedonic depression due to no longer feeling like there is a purpose to their life, most continue to strive to create and explore cool stuff, because they are free.
Maslow showed us what happens when we get our basic needs met, unconditionally, and then move up to higher levels of self-transcendent consciousness, and have a greater purpose of serving life as a whole, rather than just their own limited physical and emotional needs.


That's authoritarian rule.  The opposite of communism.
Socialism is just a short term transition state where central authority is used to destroy itself, and set everyone free from the memetic virus of life as a competitive point scoring game (money).
Communism is just evolutionary biology scaled up from an organism made up of individual cells to a larger organism made up of organisms.  The Earth will be a whole system, with all of us animal, vegetable, mineral, etc. Earthlings being valuable parts, taken good care of by the emergent system, through the natural diversity of interests and designs of each of us, plus the shared goal of being healthy.  Communism is, essentially, what everyone promoting decentralization of our world is working towards.

Yes, in a sense.  Because cancer is a sickness.  
Imagine you have a shared home space with many different housemates.  Imagine that one of them unknowingly eats some food that has some rancid meat in it, and gets violently ill, puking all over the place, including you.  You, somehow, managed to not get sick, despite eating the same food.  Maybe because your immune system is stronger, or because your genetic make-up is different and your body doesn't react by vomiting, but instead will give you diarrhea later tonight, or whatever. 
So here's the test for what kind of system you've got in your household:
1. Do you banish her from the house?  Treat her as an enemy?  Blame her for her rude behavior?  Or just expect some kind of compensation for the clean-up you're doing?  ("She *owes* me after that!")
2. Or do you find a bucket for her to puke in, and maybe call a doctor?  Do you try to clean up the mess she made, while looking to figure out if there is something that can be done to solve her sickness?  Do you give her sympathy, and ask her if there is anything she needs, unconditionally?  Or, do you maybe just give her space and stick to your bedroom to stay out of the way while she and maybe others sort things out, if you don't have the energy to help?
Number 2 is a decentralized system.   is a heavily centralized system.
In a decentralized system all who want to be a part of the system are part of it, with no permission from others needed, and no debts incurred.  It's a fully free system, where all are able to be themselves, and are able to get support from many different sources, whenever possible.
@_date: 2019-06-06 12:20:16
For it to be truly decentralized, everyone would have to be able to make up their own rules for how much money there is and how it's allocated.
(A currency can't be decentralized, logically, since the whole point of making "a" currency is to establish central rules for the stuff.)

There's nothing stopping Bitcoin from being changed, and it happens, too.
It's just that the people changing Bitcoin are doing it in the open, as the code is open source, and it's the general public who are allowed to do it, instead of nations, which are governed by elected officials and contractors.
To change the US dollar, you'd need to elect someone who wanted to change it the way you wanted, and you'd have to be a citizen in good standing to even vote, and there's no guarantee that they'd do it.
To change Bitcoin, you can become a developer, and if your idea gets consensus, it becomes the new norm.
It's all still changeable by a central authority, but with Bitcoin anyone in the world can try to get that authority, freely.

The people are not problematic, the goal of taking resources from others, in such a way that causes harm, is.
We all do it.  And it's always harmful, to everyone, including us, in the long run.
Greed and hoarding are a sickness.  Creative collaboration is the only way to evolve, in life.  But evolution is thorough, and has to try even the dumb/sick ideas, before ruling them out.
Human society is like a toddler learning to walk, and falling over a lot, before finding out the best approach to moving the whole organism forward at the same time, rather than different parts trying to move too fast.
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:56:55
I'm describing things logically/mathematically, rather than with the arbitrary pop-culture way that most folks have picked up from the media.
If everyone is operating under shared/consensus rules, then it is centralized control: the rules are the center of control.
If everyone is free to have their own, unique rules for how they behave in a system, then it is decentralized control.
A single currency has to be centralized, otherwise it's not a single currency. Once we split up our ideas for how to create and allocate it, then it's no longer a single, centralized system, and becomes decentralized, as the collective "currencies" is.
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:07:26
Also, no this isn't just a personal opinion on centralized systems, it's logic, linguistics, and math.
There are systems with centers that control the whole, and systems with no centers, with control being all over the place.  The goal of centralized systems is to keep things predictable and... well... in control.  The goal of a decentralized system is not to have a goal, essentially.  Or for each individual part in the system to be equally free to have their own, different goals, leading to chaos and randomness of behavior.

That's the opposite of communism, of which socialism is a kludgy transition state. Communism is a decentralized system with no rules that all must follow, but a freedom to be ourselves, and do the work that we were born to do (and find most fun to do).  The way Marx and Engels might have imagined this transition happening might be with violence, but the end goal is the opposite, and as I see it, since we're already in a centralized, enforced, set of rules that coerce us into repressing our dreams and needs (and instead compete against our family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers for artificial Monopoly points).
In a healthy decentralized (Communist) system, there is no central set of rules that all follow, just diverse individuals doing their weird thing, as it works in our animal bodies, with all of the different species' different cells doing their weird thing, and a whole organism just kinda naturally emerging, with no plan, just a shared goal of being healthy.


Yes.  And it's a centralized, top-down one, where everyone follows the same rules, so that the system is predictable and controllable, and if someone doesn't follow the rules, they get punished/kicked out (forks, double spending, just basically losing their money, etc.).
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:25:48
Like I said, once we actually have a system where your needs are met, freely, and you are free to do whatever you want to create and/or explore in the universe, you'll naturally be drawn to doing something valuable for the world, rather than trying to fulfill an unmet need with addictive, meaningless things, which is what you're mostly describing here.
We're all suffering from this, as humans, in a society based on denying ourselves our needs, because we think that competing against ourselves is what we're "supposed" to do.
It sucks for all of us, but because we're intelligent, at least occasionally, as a species, we're figuring this out.  And we're starting to give up on the viral meme of competition as a way of organizing our lives, and instead look to collaborate to serve our needs, freely, by choosing to be free ourselves.
There's a process we go through, naturally, to understand our highest dreams for doing awesome stuff in life, if you want to try it out on yourself...

@_date: 2019-06-06 13:15:08


Yes.  Most folks are confused.  I'm talking about the geometry of a system, where there is either a shared control center, aka, shared rules governing the core behavior of the system, or decentralized control of the rules, with every element in the system having different rules for their own behavior.
For example art is a decentralized system, as anyone can make art any way they want.  While an art contest, where all art submitted has to be a certain medium, size range, subject matter, etc., would be a centralized system.
In a centralized system there can be top down (totalitarian) or both top down and bottom up (democratic).  Bitcoin is sort of democratic, but is more of a meritocratic centralized system, really.  It's just that Bitcoin is more open to anyone who really wants to participate in the central governance, if they are willing to learn to code, get equipment, and spend the time working on it. Which is different from how Facebook, or national banks, tend to work when it comes to deciding who gets to govern things.
And most currencies are distributed, as well as always being centralized, with multiple banks, computer databases, etc. running things.  The single Bitcoin ledger is distributed just as the computers keeping track of your bank account probably are, since that's sensible for security.

Thankfully drug-free, except for my awesome genetically programmed serotonin and testosterone and estrogen (but not dopamine).

But it's a common trope.  Allowing one to think badly of anyone who's suffering, and blame them for "not thinking more positively about their reality.
As I see it, we are always the complete sum of our genes and environment.  Inputs and outputs.  We can't be something we're not.  Survival means that the body is getting a bare minimum, temporarily. Thriving is when the body is getting all that it needs to flourish and grow effectively.  No supernatural magic mind power.  Just normal physical processes doing what they do.  And our level of awareness, and specific kinds of thoughts and feelings, emerge from that.

Central is the word we start with.  The mathematical meaning, since we're talking about systems.  Then go from there.  The original word meant the stationary point of a compass, around which everything revolves.

Yes, Bitcoin is pushing the limits of imaginary competitive game points (money, grades, votes, etc.) to the extreme so that we can see why it isn't actually useful.  We keep trying to make the zero-sum, competitive game work by tweaking little bits to make it better, but once we do that as far as possible, with things like cryptocurrencies that are "decentralized" (in theory but not in practice, really) and "democratic", and see that they still don't let life be healthy and thrive, we have to finally admit that that game just isn't what we want.  It's either boring or too hard, depending on the luck of the draw, and a bit of psycopathy.

The future you end up in is the future you expect to end up in.  And since there are probably all possible realities in the multiverse, where you and up and where I end up might well be quite different.

@_date: 2017-11-18 14:12:37
Ok, here's an economics lesson that you might not have been offered yet.  It's one based on physics and biology and systems theory and a smidge of linguistics...
From Merriam-Webster:




This is what money is, a way of numerically quantifying the fraction of the whole that an individual "owns".  If I own $1 out of the whole, then that particular $1 can't be owned by anyone else.  For someone else to have it, they have to take it away from me.  
The words "zero sum" refer to the fact that the sum of all gains and losses in the game is zero.  If you gain one point, someone has to lose 1 point. 
(+1) - (-1) = 0
It's a win-lose game.  
This is in comparison to a positive sum game, or a win-win game, where the goal is for everyone to get something useful.  This happens in a healthy, living ecosystem, where value is generated "out of thin air" by using creativity and growth.  This is what evolution/biology uses naturally.  It's qualitative, not quantitative.
Money fails for living systems because it, quite literally, doesn't account for the value that is added to a system by simply living in it.  Life is a *creative* process, adding new things to the world, in ways that non-living things can't.  Life is the peak of entropy (contrary to what a lot of folks are taught), as life is all about breaking down simple, boring things (like "raw materials" and old ideas) and reorganizing them in novel ways to generate babies, art, technology, and philosophy.
When it comes to a real economy, the one evolution uses, value is measured in how creative things are and how well that creativity serves the whole system.  In evolution, natural selection measures fitness by how well the things that individuals make flow through the system and help it expand in both space and diversity.  
Healthy babies, meaningful art, effective technology, and enlightening philosophy improve the system's health, overall.  So the more free these things can flow through the system, the better off we all are.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:51:53
As I said, people can decide to make new rules, but they can't do it on Bitcoin.  They have to make a new currency.  That's why it's called a fork, not a total change in the rules.  
Bitcoin itself can't fork.  Some other set of rules can use the old ledger as a starting point for something else, though.

How an apple got there does not change the value of an apple to the physics of the body.  And the body's physical needs are what we're measuring.  For the purpose of increasing the health/fitness of the body.  Which is the goal of evolution/life.
Also, if someone flew an apple from New Zealand to Maine, and there's also an apple that fell off a tree in Maine, the one that flew here is actually worth less, likely, because it's less fresh.  And, of course, it was probably a waste of energy, which is a negative value for the planet.
Not that long ago, I was in Maine, buying groceries to take with me to Massachusetts.  I saw a bag of organic apples, and thought it would be nice to bring some nice, fresh, local apples down with me, so I got them and lugged them for a few miles from the store to where I was staying and then to the bus station.  While sitting on the bus, for the 5.5 hour trip, I opened the bag to eat one and discovered that the apple tasted crappy.  I looked more closely at the bag and it said "Washington" on it.  I could have bought those stupid, mushy apples in any decent store in Massachusetts.  I'd suffered a fair bit of complaint by my body, and wasted the energy that the bus was using to transport the extra 5-10 pounds, for no good reason.  Those apples were now far less valuable to my body.  Most of them ended up being tossed in the compost, uneaten by any human.


Right.  It's all about measuring to the most reasonable level that makes sense for the current situation.  Just like we don't measure the distance from Maine to Massachusetts in millimeters, we don't need to measure apples in atoms, usually.  It's always going to be subjective.  That's how a healthy decentralized system of a living organism, even on a planetary level, works.


There is no exchange.  No zero-sum-ness.  Just valuation for each subjective body.  Right now my body needs more water.  Around a liter would do for the next couple of hours, probably.  It's a very basic and regular need, so whatever liter of water is closest to me, and not being used by anyone else now or in the near future, has a very high value to me.  If a resource allocating system knows that, it can get me the water I need with the least waste, for a truly efficient, free economy.  No forced exchanges, just free flow of things from where they are un-needed/un-wanted to where they are needed/wanted.


Well, as I said, it's all relative to how much detail we need in making a measurement for our current purpose.  But, yes, computers (even if we never actually get artificially intelligent beings) will be able to measure in more precise detail, for the rare situations that such precision is needed, as in calculating rocket ship navigation and such.

Free as in a gift.  As in you give or get it without any expectation or demand.  The way everything you get in life is pretty much free, except a few crazy things that humans try to con you into trading something for.
The plants and other animals and stars and air and water are all there to help us get what we need, totally for free.  We just have to choose to be free as well, instead of trying to keep score in some grand Monopoly game.
This is how your body works.  Each cell is free to do what it wants, and gets what it needs by the system, for free, naturally, due to the genius of evolution and diversity/specialization making every individual want to fill some niche role in the system instinctively.  When we do what we love, everything just gets done.  Money gets in the way of that, so nothing important gets done, really.

Eventually, no one needs money.  Even if it takes a long time, and moving to a new planet, or living on a spaceship.
Money and other competitive point scoring memes like democracy and school grades are bizarre little experiments that humans invented to gamify life, to great destruction, of ourselves, and our whole planet.  Using our resources to compete against ourselves is hugely moronic, and wastes our collective power.  Do you have any idea how many beautiful brains, that could be solving all kinds of big and little problems for us human and non-human Earthlings are instead sick and actually *causing problems*, due to being malnourished and abused, simply because their bodies don't have enough of whatever the arbitrary point scoring numbers are popular in the game that's going on in their local environment?

I'm not sure how to explain this any simpler.
If you can use your own rules for who, what, where, when, and how, you're free, and if the system welcomes this, then it's decentralized.
If you are all following the same rules for any, or all, of the who, what, where, when, and/or how, then it's centralized.

My education level has nothing to do with what Marx and Engels wrote, or what authoritarian regimes like the USSR, China, or the USA use as propaganda.
There are no Socialist nations.  And never have their been.  On Earth anyway.  Not as Marx and Engels described.  So searching Google won't help you here, when it comes to finding one.  A Socialist nation would have equality of access to power, a government that gives, rather than takes, to the majority of the humans, and a government that is intentionally temporary, with the goal of disassembling the government, to allow for a healthy decentralized (chaotic/free) one, where there aren't laws or centralized control.

Yes, Bitcoin is indeed part of that last gasp.  Money is competition.  Zero-sum.  Not at all what evolution/nature/life/physics wants for us in the future.
Bitcoin is an attempt to try to keep the competitive game going just a bit longer, while also introducing actually useful processes of decentralization of power (sort of) and global connection (the blockchain).  So, it's partly antiquated and partly novel.  We'll drop the antiquated part soon enough.  Once the tipping point of the monetary game is reached and humans realize how insane and boring it is to play Monopoly as a real life thing, compared to creative collaboration and collective problem solving (see: science).
@_date: 2019-06-12 11:07:47
I *move away* from someone harming me.  I don't tolerate it, but if my system is a decentralized one, then I do indeed welcome that individual into the space.
For example, my husband, or some of the children I've had in my class as a teacher, have been violent, and hurt me, and I did not try to force them out of our shared space, because they belonged there as much as I did.
A free (decentralized) system is one where movement is expected as different individuals connect and disconnect as they need to, based on their needs.  If a direct connection relationship is not serving both parties (consensual) than they will disconnect from one another, but that doens't change the fact that they are both still connected to the whole system.  I don't need to leave the school or house for me to move away from an angry child or husband.  I just temporarily move away from them, so that they have the space to be angry without harming me.  If someone was exceedingly violent, and I did need to leave the "system" temporarily, I would be welcome back, if the system is indeed a decentralized one.
In a centralized system, on the other hand, I could force that child or family member to leave, or they could force me out permanently.

Um... everyone is embracing the centralization of Bitcoin, even moreso than national/bank currencies.  That's why folks have "trust" in it, as there is a single ledger that is the most secure (centralized/unchangable) of all currencies, supposedly.  If there weren't so much trust in the Bitcoin rules and governance, then it would just be the same old same old arbitrary currency that is too easily modifiable, the way banks/nations can generate money whenever they want.  Bitcoin is even more solid and stable as a government, with a set of rules that are very hard to change.  It's possibly the most centralized currency out there.
What it is, when compared to national/bank currencies, though, is open-source, and the "hiring" process for defining and maintaining those core rules (the code and ledger and miners/nodes) is more of a free-for-all if you have the skills and interest and resources to join, as opposed to needing to go through an interview or election process as with banks/nations (or Facebook).  Bitcoin is more democratic, ish, then.  Though technically the Western governments are democratic as well.

If it's a platform, it's centralized.
What we need is to have our own servers in our homes and community spaces, run by non-profit service providers, so that we own our own content "platforms" and it's truly decentralized.  Then companies, and non-profits, and open source software/apps can catalogue our content and people can search or subscribe to whatever content they want.
Bitcoin's ledger is a good example of a healthy, non-profit catalogue service for the public, which keeps track of where things are and how they change, so maybe someone can figure out how to use blockchain to serve as a content catalogue and search function for a web that works the way it was designed, as decentralized, hyperlinked information network.

They exist in the code.  The math that generates Bitcoin is the law that defines how many Bitcoins there are, total.  Bitcoin doesn't exist beyond the code, anyway.  The code/laws are all that we have.  Mining doesn't make Bitcoin "exist", mining transfers the Bitcoin value to a specific wallet, rather than the pool.  Sort of like how Monopoly money not yet given out by the $200 when you pass go still exists.

You can make up whatever definition for terms that you want, but I tend to stick to the most literal and logical and original meaning.
And I'm not sure what you're thinking when you say that no one has control of a currency.  That makes no sense that I can see.  Clearly there are rules, and those rules are generated by an individual something or other.  In the case of Bitcoin it's whomever shows up with the right skills and equipment.  In the case of Facebucks or whatever, it's whomever is working for Facebook.  And in the case of the US$ it's the Fed.  Each has an authority making the rules up.  
All have some sense of democratic governance, though, which is what you're thinking of I'd say, when you say "decentralized". The central rules are both top down and bottom up, where the votes/feedback from the "little people" at least partly controls the center/consensus.  This is different from an actually decentralized system which is entirely bottom-up, with no central/consensus rules that everyone follows.
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:19:18
You're thinking too narrow-mindedly, imagining some human in the center of control.  Systems are more complex than that.  The center of control is a set of rules.  Like code, which everyone is following.  That code can sometimes be in an individual human, but it's usually in a larger, more complex container, like a book, or a set of laws, both written and unwritten, that are followed.
The key is following.  The rules.  I mean.  As opposed to making up your own rules, as in a decentralized system, where everyone is free to do their own thing, while still being welcome in the system.  Your own body, if you are an animal like me, is made up of thousands of cells that are of a different species and gene expression within species, with all of the code being at least partly unique to each cell.  No cell is following anyone else's rules.  There is no central authority controlling them, and all are free.  This is healthy, but no "utopia", just normal healthy life, with occasional imperfections and forced centralization problems (harmful viruses).
Bitcoin has central rules, which, if not followed, kick you out (a fork, or having your transaction rejected as a "double spend" or somesuch).

So you are free to decide how to create and allocate Bitcoin entirely on your own, and make your own edits to the ledger?
Yeah, no...  I think folks really don't understand what a centralized system means.  It's very weird.
Bitcoin's popularity is *because* it's so stable and solid and unchangeable except by an elite group of developers/miners/nodes.  If the ledger and rules for generating and allocating Bitcoin were less centralized, it would just be any old currency.
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:01:56
Yeah, I know that most folks are very confused about systems theory, and complexity, and what pop culture uses these terms for is pretty arbitrary, so it's not at all surprising that you're confused.
I've been working on making a video to explain it, and I'm sure I'll link to it in lots of places when I finally get it finished.
Until then, the best way to understand centralized and decentralized systems is to ask if everyone uses the same set of rules/code/process for how things happen, or if everyone is connected directly to different individuals, using their own different rules/code/process for how they do it.  [Here's a diagram]( though you can't see the time dimension here, well, so it might not be as clear as it could be.  (Hence the video goal.)
For example, if everyone goes to the same school in a town, then the school system is centralized, or if everyone uses the same software/platform for social media, then social media is centralized.  For a decentralized school system, each student would be finding their own teachers, and choosing their own subjects independently, and doing their work wherever and whenever they wanted to.  For a decentralized social media system, we'd all keep our own content on our own personal servers, and everyone could subscribe via something like an rss feed to individuals and types of content that they wanted, with no centralized algorithms deciding what kinds of content and who gets, and doesn't get seen (the way Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. work).

I think you're just imagining things in a weird way.
You're far more likely to be personally mugged or have a car stolen, or a house broken into.  I've been mugged.  I've had a house broken into.  I almost had my car stolen (but a neighbor heard the glass break on my car window, and scared off the thief!)  It's just a part of being a human in a world that denies humans their basic needs and forces us to compete just to survive.
But, realistically, it's far more challenging for you to try to steal my Bitcoin than my vehicle, or stuff in my home (if I had one, that is, which I don't, as I'm literally homeless), or even access my credit card or bank account (I've had my credit card data stolen recently, even).  This is actually one reason folks like Bitcoin so much.  It's very hard to steal.  Though, admittedly, this also means it's very hard to get in the first place. :-)

People like Bitcoin because it's extremely centralized, and stable, and unchangeable, and impervious to attacks.  The ledger and core rules are like a fortress.  That's the appeal of it.  That centralized rule/order.
And I'm reading this with the literal definition of the word central in mind.  Not some weird, arbitrary, political techno-speak that someone came up with to sound smart.

The IRS doesn't tax Bitcoin, they tax profits/income, regardless of how you got it.
**If you keep your investment for at least a year before selling it or buying something with it**, even if you've made a profit, **as long as you earn less than just under $40,000 a year, total income, then you have a 0% tax on your Bitcoin gains**.  If you hold for less than a year, or earn more than that, then you pay capital gains (and are clearly rich, and maybe want to scale back and live a little, instead of making more and more money. :-)

Um... you're forgetting the entire definition of a free system (decentralized) is that everyone is free to do their own thing.  In Bitcoin, the nodes can't.  If they do, they get booted out (or fork).

I'm not sure what you mean about Bitcoin going to a million dollars.  
Most property costs way less than that.  Especially in rural areas, even in over priced US America.  It's definitely way cheaper in most other parts of the world.
I've never asked for "spare change".  I live with whatever I have.  Last year I got some extra money and put as much as I could into Bitcoin.
Now I have enough to actually buy something cheap.  If I wait a bit longer, I might be able to get something almost nice.

Human society has never used actual Communism on a large scale, so you wouldn't have a way to make that judgment yet.
If you think that totalitarian regimes like China and the USSR etc., are Communist, then you've bought into their propaganda nicely.

Every individual is free to do whatever work they want, and gets what they need freely from the system.  Anything else is repressive.

You can change the ledger by convincing someone to send Bitcoin to your wallet, or send Bitcoin to their wallet, for one.
To change the core code, you, along with many others, democratically (ish) can try to vote to change them.  But you'll need a lot of support, as the system is large, and not easily moved, which is why so many people like centralized systems.  Centralized systems are very stable.

Bitcoin has gatekeepers too.  They are mostly anonymous/unknown, though.  And being one requires a different skillset and resources than what it takes to work at Facebook, or get elected/appointed in a national government/bank.  But all currencies are still all run by some small elite who decide who, what, where, when, and how it is allocated.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:07:13
Well, there's no need to completely ignore the exchange rate.  I mean, if it just went up to an all time high, or just went up a whole bunch, you're fine waiting for it to drop a bit.  
And when it drops a lot, that's when it's time to exchange a bit extra if you want.
I stopped getting Bitcoin when it hit about $11,000 last time.  And then I got a whole bunch when it was down in the $3-4,000's recently.

In a free/decentralized system no one can force me to connect with any one else, I am always free to leave, and reconnect with anyone else I want, who might be able to protect me if I need it.

So while the current human experience is so bleak, as you tell it, I see a reality far beyond that, and see the beauty of the universe, as well as how evolution always moves us to a far more creative, curious, and collaboratively playful place, in time.

I would have liked to try mining back in maybe 2013, but there was no clear way to do it, and it seemed like no one wanted to help me try, so I didn't bother.  Then when I got a bunch of money I had to spend very quickly I started thinking about getting some.  It took a while because even buying it is nearly impossible if you aren't super determined.  But I was.  And I did, starting in October of last year.
And I still have nearly all of it.  I bought a cheapish fidget spinner a while back and just paid for shipping some art a couple of weeks ago.

Yes, as I already said...
The ants all have the same programming/rules they are following.  While human bodies have at least 10,000 different species' cells, with lots of different gene expressions within species, all doing their own thing (different rules/genes/programs), and a whole organism just happening to emerge, in all it's random weirdness.
One way to think about it, as I've said before, is if a system is predictable, then it's centralized.  Ant colonies are predictable, for the most part, maybe not from the individual behavior of a sole ant, but given that each ant has the same behavior as most other ants, we get predictable collective behavior.
Humans are highly unpredictable.  Even doctors are pretty damned lost when it comes to figuring out how we work.  That's because all of our species have their own ideas of what they want to do, creating a highly chaotic system, which happens to function well, because each individual has evolved/grown to serve some niche role in the system, without actually knowing what the system as a whole needs.

Consensus is centralization, yes.  There is no confusion.
Central rules that everyone follows means a centralized system.  Bitcoin is highly centralized, as even a slight deviation of the norm boots you out of the system, as we see with forks.
Decentralized systems have everyone doing their own thing, with no shared consensus about the who, what, where, when, how of things.  This is how your body works, or how art works, or how currencies as a whole work.
This is the logical way to describe things based on geometry and the literal meaning of the words, rather than some arbitrary socio-political jargon.
@_date: 2019-06-11 13:52:33
It has nothing to do with "tolerance" in fact.
It has to do with whether or not an individual is free to be part of a system or if others can kick them out for behaving with different rules.
If you have any ability, alone or with others, to force someone else out of a system, or force them to obey your own rules, then it's centralized.  If you can do it alone, it's probably a totalitarian system, if you need a large percentage of consensus for the action, then it's democratic.


If you're treating anyone else based on some centralized authority, or morality (rules), then it's a centralized system.  You probably feel like that's the only option, because you've been taught to be obedient, and that safety is more preferable to allowing unpredictability and having freedom.  That's the norm these days for most humans.


If you tried to kick them out, then obviously it would be centralized, with you having control over them.
Remember, the core term here is control.  Where is the control?  In each individual, fully?  Or in some *central* set of rules that *all must follow*?
Your body is a decentralized government, with no consensus for what cells do.  Many cells do share the same genes (the same individual within a species), especially the homo sapiens' genes (normal and mitochondrial), but there are about 10,000 different species in the body, and even with those who are the same "individual" gene type each cell has a different gene expression, so the centralization is pretty minimal, and sticks mostly to the specific organs (my homo sapiens' heart cells are pretty similar, and if a foreign cell tries to come into the heart, it might be kicked out, for example).  But on the whole, the body is decentralized, as cells are free to be whomever they are, and can move to wherever they fit best, freely, and get what they need to function well freely, as well. 
Eventually, all natural systems evolve this complexity.  It's emergence, and is what works best for any large system.  Smaller organizations of individuals have shared goals (circulatory system, nervous system) with specific kinds of functions (take in oxygen, remove waste, process sensory data, etc.), and individuals are free to give and receive whatever they most want to give and receive, without trade or accounting/score-keeping.

Do your research to find a hardware wallet, or "paper wallet", option for yourself.  Keep your savings on those.  Only use a website/app for sharing a public address, and then transfer anything you aren't planning to use/spend/trade off of the website/app, so that it's really yours.

Yep, all centralized systems have shared rules that all elements within the system follow.
A decentralized system is chaotic and has everyone with their own rules, doing their own thing, and having no predictable outcome.  This is why decentralized/complex systems are called "emergent", as whatever happens is unpredictable given the starting points.  Art is my favorite example, where everyone is just doing their own thing, and even the artist themself doesn't know what the outcome will be.
Another example of a complex/chaotic/decentralized system is the human body, where there are something like 10,000 different sets of genes, mostly species of bacteria, plus two from homosapiens, and each cell with it's own unique gene expression, based on it's local conditions.  Every cell is just doing it's own thing, with no universal rules for what they do, but the unexpected outcome being a whole human being.
How it works without centralized governance is a part of how reality works.  The only centralized rules that all cells in my body share are the laws of physics: entropy and evolution.

Centralized means that there is a shared (central) governance.  In the case of Bitcoin, that's the software and ledger, which control the generation and allocation of Bitcoin.
If I could just decide, on my own, how much Bitcoin I had, and so could you, that would be decentralized.  Like how art is decentralized, so that anyone can be an artist, while making art in any way they want, without any central governance regulating how it's done.
Consensus governance is indeed centralization in the sense of how systems work.
What Bitcoin is is open/public and global in it's centralized governance.  This is in contrast to national currencies which, while sort of democratic, only really have some folks voting for the folks who make decisions, or appoint others to make decisions, about how the currency is generated and allocated.
As for "wrong" or "right" this is is just geometry, really.  You just look at how a system functions, and see if the individual behavior is predictable (centralized rules) or chaotic (decentralized rules).  With any currency, for it to be useful, it has to be predictable, which is why Bitcoin is even better than US$ which is less predictable, as the government can decide to print more, or less, at any time, while Bitcoin's generation is highly regulated.

If you actually read about chaos theory, you'll discover that there are indeed overall patterns, such as the Lorenz attractor, which can be used to make reasonable predictions of general directions.  Not specifics, but general ones.

The problem is that we need to have these non-public keys for Bitcoin to maintain it's integrity (of not double-spending, which is basically akin to counterfeiting money).  To transfer a physical coin, both the giver and receiver would have to know the private key.  Which is where problems happen.  This is how scammers manage to steal Bitcoin from hardware wallets like Ledger, as they set up a wallet on the hardware, keep the seed words, while also putting them on a scratch ticket style card, and then tell the buyer of the Ledger to scratch off the card, to reveal their seed words, which they use to access the wallet.  When there is money in the wallet, the scammers just take it out, because they still have the seed words.  That would be a problem with any physical coins, as well.

All currencies are centralized scams, really.
They are all imaginary symbols of value, where the generation and allocation of the currency is controlled by some set of rules (the central authority).  Those rules can be decided in any way you want, from meritocracy, to democracy, to plutocracy, to totalitarianism (Bitcoin, as well as most national currencies, are a mix of all of these combined).

You're operating on the old fashioned ideas of a steady state theory of the universe.  It's probably not a very useful theory.  But if you're attached to it, that's fine.  But most of physics has evolved from that to be a little more realistic.
Even if the randomness is deterministic (which I believe it is), it's still not fully predictable, since we can't predict which of the possible timelines we happen to end up going down (which wave function collapse we observe).  Technically, we take all of the possible paths, but each path is only aware of itself.  The whole split timelines in a multiverse is becoming one of the most likely options for theories.  But who knows.  Certainly we're missing some info, and we always will, since we're limited beings even if there is only one timeline. :-)
As far as the patterns that do hold for larger regions of space~time, yes, they are pretty useful, but no good scientist would ever say they were "right" or "reliable" in a universal sense.
Whether we're talking about Bitcoin or gravity, there are both good predictions, and some expectation of surprise.

Indeed.  Bitcoin is the most centralized currency out there for normal public use.  It's also the most global and distributed, when it comes to who's regulating and maintaining it, so there is far less chance of being changed.
It's still got a lot of plutocracy, along with the meritocracy and democracy, that gets in the way of it being more reliable, but at least there are a whole lot of different individuals and groups involved, looking to keep things going, so that the confidence stays high.

The fees vary.  The highest I've paid was about $2 so far.  The lowest was about 50¢.
I haven't paid much attention to the time it takes.  No one has complained that it didn't get there.
And remember, Bitcoin isn't made for making tons of tiny purchases.  It's made to be one of many options.  And, really, things that don't cost much are better off being free, in the long run, since keeping records on mostly worthless stuff is a waste of everyone's time and energy.
In the near future most of the day to day stuff we consume, from food to simple/basic things like clothes and books and such will be free to everyone, made by cheap fabricators/robots, locally housed in community owned spaces, using mostly local resources.  So using currency for that stuff will be unnecessary.  Only the really complicated, customized, artistic and maybe hard to replicated things, or services, will cost money.  Those purchases will be only occasional for most of us, so something like Bitcoin is fine.

That would be democratic, not decentralized.
If there are shared, central, rules that govern behavior of those in the system, then it's centralized.
A decentralized system is chaotic and unpredictable.   My favorite example of a decentralized system is art.  There are no shared rules for making art.  You do whatever you want.  And no one, not even you, can predict what the outcome will be when you start to make art.  
A centralized system is one that is controlled and predictable in how it works, because there are rules that all must follow or be kicked out of the system (or punished).  
A decentralized system is uncontrollable and unpredictable, because there are no rules, except the ones that individuals use themselves (and the laws of physics, obviously).

Ok, to be clear here, I was being sarcastic in my first comment to you.  
My point is that theories are always incomplete, but also are quite useful.  Descartes reminded us that we can never have any proof of *anything* at all beyond "something exists" (cogito ergo sum, which came from his idea that "I can doubt my observations therefore this doubting thing exists").  But we don't stop there.  We don't just throw in the towel and say "Alas!  Nothing is ever knowable! Thinking is moot!  There is nothing more to do!" and die on the spot.  No, we look for useful patterns.  And get better and better at predicting, so that we can work better with the reality around us.
So, while we can't predict the weather in this exact location at some exact time in the somewhat distant future, we can, fairly reasonably, predict the general climate, even though it's an (almost) infinitely complex system.

Bitcoin plays in the global currency market as a free agent.
The global currency market is heavily interconnected.  *This* is where the exchange rates happen.
Outside of that market, 1 Bitcoin is, and likely always will be, 1/21,000,000 of the total Bitcoins.

More open and creative than that.  Like it was when everyone had their own funny little blogs, but this time we will develop a really robust categorization system, and a kick ass search function, and be able to subscribe to different types of content, even for each individual.  And we'll have machine learning algorithms that we can subscribe to to help us find new individuals and content that we actually want (as opposed to what makes some corporation money).

Well, I'd say Bitcoin is primarily a plutocracy, because you absolutely have to have either Bitcoin itself (which is literally money), or the equipment to run a miner or node, to be able to "vote".  Developers need less money, and they do have some power, obviously, but they don't actually vote (the democratic part), unless they, also, have Bitcoin, or a node or mining machine running.
If the US$ was run by a government like the US used to have, where only land-owning men could vote, that would be more like Bitcoin now.
Except that the real power was Satoshi, who created the whole idea, and right now most votes are just to keep things as Satoshi designed them.  So there's a bit of a difference.  Also, obviously, Bitcoin is global and open to the public, so that if you *do* have enough resources to be involved, and you want to, no one can stop you.

It's not at all centralized if I'm free to come and go on my own accord, both in and out of the system, and around the system itself.  In fact, that's pretty much the definition of a decentralized system.
A centralized system is one where you are not free to come and go, but that doing so is enforced.  Either you follow the rules of the system, or you're kicked out.


An infinite number of things.  That's why it's a decentralized system. There are no shared/global rules, just individuals making decisions for themselves, as long as those decisions don't try to control anyone else (change their rules).  As long as the violence is not trying to trap me, or anyone else, then we're free to go elsewhere.  That's decentralization: freedom to wander and choose who, what, where, when, and how, for ourselves.


Obviously.  That's literally what a decentralized system IS.  It's a chaotic/natural/random/emergent/bottom-up system.  That's what all healthy organisms use, overall, as a governing structure.


Well, given your comments, you're definitely not understanding the kind of system that evolution uses for creation.


The opposite.  That's a centralized system you're talking about, where we're not free to choose who, what, where, when, and how we interact with others.  That's what we have now on a national scale, and also on local scales, in many places, as we don't have a choice but to be subjected to abusive landlords, town/city governments, state/nation governments, and even businesses, as we try to live our lives.
In a decentralized family system, no matter how sick my husband gets, or I get, no matter where on the planet (or off!) we're still family, and still are a unit, as long as we feel connected to one another. He can leave, and come back, whenever he wants, and still is my husband. I can be angry at him, and not want to talk to him, and he's still my husband.  He can need to take a break from being around me, and then come back, freely.  Not because someone decrees it a law, but because it's a random combination of him and me that made us us.  We just emerged as a system.  There may have been marriage licenses registered with state governments, but that's not what made us a system.  We, together, chose to be a system, voluntarily, randomly, chaotically, naturally.  And any procreative activities we have had generated more, emergent, random, chaotic, natural, offspring that are part of our system as well, for as long as they feel connected to us.  No one can force us to be a part of the system, and no one can kick us out.  
That kind of a system isn't necessarily physical/geographical, but exists on a more energetic level of emotions, ideas, philosophy, and information flow.  It's about connection in any sense, with each of us influencing the other/s in any direction, because we choose to be influenced by them.


Exactly.  That's the appeal of a centralized system, it's predictable, "safe", and contained.  It's not free to flow, not consensual, not able to grow and adapt and change easily, compared to a decentralized, natural, chaotic, random system, like real life.

Any zero-sum, competitive point scoring game will naturally result in horrible inequality, no matter how it starts out.
Bitcoin's purpose in Earth's evolution is not as a monetary system, but as a transition out of money, and other competitive games, as a way of life, an into a pro-social, collaborative game of freedom to create and explore the universe, while using a centralized architecture of a global nervous system and circulatory system to organize the healthy distribution of resources from where they are offered to where they are needed/useful.
Bitcoin is the alpha testing for that [centralized nervous system for the Earth](

Bitcoin isn't for boring people.
However, we do need to start using Bitcoin in the way it was designed, if we want it to succeed on a global scale, and that means we need to actually use it as a truly peer-to-peer, direct way to pay for things, buy things, and give money to the people we want to do business with.  Encouraging people to use third-party banks/exchanges as a way to get Bitcoin defeats the entire purpose of Bitcoin.

Because growth is exponential, typically.  This is a normal graph for growing things.  It's often called a "log chart", as in logarithms (exponential growth).
A simple way to think about it is that if you buy into a stock or Bitcoin or whatever, you care more about the ratio of your investment to any potential value than you care about the literal numbers.  For example, if you buy $10 worth, you will appreciate when the value multiplies by 10, to give you $100 in value.  This kind of exponential graph allows you to see that sort of growth easily, as it doesn't matter when you bought in.  That jump from one y line to the next will always multiply your investment by 10.

The thing is that you can either work with reality, or fight against it.
The former is often effective.
The latter always results in you, and others, getting hurt.
It's your choice, though.
If you like science, then fighting against reality is the opposite way you want to go.  Nature/evolution programs genes to be diverse, so that when a disaster happens and wipes out the "normal" types, those that are on the fringe have a chance, because they have a different approach to doing things.
This is life's memetic and genetic immunization approach.  So, scientifically, there is a reason why we don't all follow the same religion/politics, even when that ideology is allowing the government/corporations to tell us what drugs/medicine is "good for us".  Nature knows best when it comes to the long term thriving of life.  Though it can suck for the ones who don't have the genes or memes to help them survive.
And if you really are immunocompromized, then moving to a part of the world where there are few humans would be the best approach.  Though I understand if living longer isn't worth the loss of family and friends close by.

Bitcoin is NOT decentralized!  A decentralized currency is a meaningless concept since there has to be a shared, central, set of rules that all agree on, for generating and allocating the currency, or it would be worthless, or at least not reliable as a currency.  (Art, for example, is decentralized, and anyone can make or use art in whatever way they want, with no central rules about how it's made or used.)  When you think about it, Bitcoin is actually far more centralized than most currencies, in that the (central) rules are super hard to change, and they are absolutely obeyed.  This is what makes Bitcoin so secure, compared to other currencies that are run by nations or corporations.  
What most people are actually describing when they say Bitcoin is decentralized is probably either that it's fully **global**, **distributed**, a bit more directly **democratic**, and/or it's fully **public** (open to all and generated and run by anyone who wants to be a developer, node runner, or miner).
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:33:33
Ok, so Bitcoin is public.  Yes, that's what I was saying.  It's fully public for the whole planet, rather than just being for a single nation, even though decisions are made democratically.  With Bitcoin you don't have to be a citizen with voting rights to vote for the Bitcoin rules, and you can even propose new rules if you want, and have them voted on, which might be harder even with very open national democracies.

No.  Obviously decentralized systems are governed in a decentralized way...
Centralized systems have central governance, where there are shared rules, making the system predictable, reliable, and controllable.  Some might "trust" a centralized system because it is hard to change the rules.  But that's a subjective thing.  And, ultimately, centralized systems tend to be more violent when they do break, as it takes a lot of effort to change them, and so that force kind of explodes everything.  Whereas a decentralized system is in constant, chaotic flow, and so while it's not predictable, it is easy to adapt to new situations when change is needed.

There is a centralized controller of every currency, including Bitcoin, or it wouldn't be useful.  Currencies need a centralized governance so that the generation and allocation of the currency is highly regulated.  Bitcoin absolutely uses centralized regulation to keep it controlled/safe.  Bitcoin's appeal is that it's more open source/public than most national currencies, which have central governance by only those who are allowed to vote in elections, and/or are hired to the various decision-making groups that make the rules.  I think the open-source/public access element of Bitcoin is what people really mean when they confusingly say "decentralized".  You couldn't have an actually decentralized currency, as everyone generating it and allocating it however they wanted to would eliminate the whole concept of a currency.  (Art, for example, is decentralized, where anyone can make it however and whenever they want.)  Bitcoin is global and open to anyone who wants to vote, making it more globally democratic/meritocratic/plutocratic than national currencies.
But, the even more valuable aspect of Bitcoin is that the rules make it essentially a percentage-based system, rather than a quantity-based one.  1 Bitcoin will always (unless there's a massive vote to change it) be 1/21,000,000th of the total.  It's unfortunate that the numbers we use in Bitcoin don't showcase this, but at least it's still the way it works.

Yeah, "decentralized" sounded hip and anarchistic, and so folks started using it without actually knowing what they were talking about.  It's ok, but it confuses everyone.
Bitcoin and national currencies have to be centralized, architecture-wise, so that they are actually currencies.  You need to control the generation and allocation of a currency for it to have any sort of reliability, which means some central database to keep track of how much there is and who gets it.
What Bitcoin is, different from national currencies, is global and open/public, so that anyone who wants to get involved, can, as long as they have the resources (computers, internet, skills) to do so.
Also, almost all currencies these days are distributed, so that there is no "central point of failure".  No nation or even most cryptocurrencies are only on one computer or are generated/allocated from any single physical location.

Yeah, ants aren't very decentralized either, since they are operating with the same rules, for the most part.  It's frustrating when mainstream educational systems promote really confusing examples and analogies (like how entropy is "like a messy room" which is totally misleading).
I think the main problem is that folks wanted a term that differentiated a system with only top-down control, as in a totalitarian government like North Korea, or, say, the National Basketball Association, from a centralized system that also involves bottom-up voting (democratic or consensus or whatever).  But they got lost and forgot about actual decentralized systems that are ONLY bottom-up, like a human body with all of it's 10,000 different species/genomes, and all of the different gene expressions in the different cells, or like my favorite example of art, with every artist doing their own thing, yet it all still being "art" somehow.
Of course, the more folks use decentralized to apply to centralized systems, the worse the confusion spreads, like a harmful viral meme.  I can try to inoculate minds, but I'm just one woman.

It has **nothing** to do with whether or not I, personally, tolerate things, or even welcome some individual into a space.  In a decentralized system what I think and feel has no control over others, unless they want it to.
If I don't tolerate some individual or behavior, in a free system (decentralized) I am free to disconnect from them.  I simply don't have control over what they do, only what I do.  And my power is to disconnect, and go somewhere else in the system, connecting to who/what, where, when, and how I choose.  With no one else forcing me to do what I don't want to do.  I'm free, and so is everyone else in a free system.  But it's not a disconnected system, because everyone is connected to someone else, usually many, and those connections change all the time, chaotically, as in real life.
In a centralized system, I, or others, can force me, and others, to connect to who/what, how, where, and when non-consensually.  I'm not free, and can be controlled by others, even when it's harmful to me.  That's what we have now for many of the larger human government systems in the form of nations, states, cities, and even homes and schools.  A majority or even minority can tell me, and you, and everyone else, who/what, where, when, and how to interact with others.  We're unfree.
Of course, a free system is not a utopia, as things break and we get sick (as in our example of the sick roommate here, or cancer), but it does mean that we're free to deal with that sickness however we want, as long as our choices are not forcing others to follow rules that go against their own form/function.

Oooh! Ninja edit.
Yes, religion is simply a group of people who choose a single idea about what is valuable, out of all of the possible options for value.
The actual meaning of religion is to "re bind".  The word has it's roots in the similar word ligament, which connects things together.  So religion is bringing individuals back together around a shared belief about something, anything.  We usually only think about it with the biggest stories of how the planet and us animals came into existence, and maybe what happens after we die, but a religion can be any idea about what is important/valuable in life.  And money is definitely one of the largest religions on the planet.  With most humans believing it's valuable.

Nothing in life is a guarantee, but reality does have patterns, general patterns that allow us to make theories that help us predict at least some thing, even in complex systems like the weather.
If your brain didn't do this, all the time, you'd never do anything, because action only happens because the body makes a prediction that doing said action will improve life in some way.  This is why (physical) depression makes us not do anything.  Because we predict that nothing we do will help.  (Sometimes correctly, sometimes not.)

It's a good point, but nothing, anywhere in the universe, is ever completely "true" (or "false"), as entropy makes everything change over time.
Bitcoin, currently, is so centralized as to be very stable in it's rules.  It would require a large proportion of the global Bitcoin nodes, users, developers, and miners to agree to change the number of Bitcoins available.  It's certainly possible, but it's unlikely, as the whole function of Bitcoin ownership being a percentage of the whole, rather than just a quantity in a changing total, is one of the primary features (along with Bitcoin being public and global).
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:57:05
I'm being fully genuous, if that's a thing.
The point is that everything is manipulated.  So it's silly to even consider Bitcoin to not be manipulated.  And there is nothing you can do that is illegal to Bitcoin, because the only rules it has are built into the software, and you're either using it correctly and getting your transactions through, or you're not.  Otherwise there are no laws that apply to it.

Just FYI Bitcoin is not a stock.
It's a currency.  If you want to buy something with a different currency, and want to use an exchange to change your currency into the seller's currency, you usually exchange a bit more so that you have more than enough, because currency exchange rates constantly fluctuate.  So yes, get more.  You also don't know exactly what the fees will be, probably, as the exchanges tend to like to charge you as much as possible so they can make a profit off of you.

Try using any word other than "decentralization" because no one understands, nor has a consensus, on what it means.
Bitcoin has two primary factors that make it different than national currencies.
1. Bitcoin is global and open/public.  Anyone at all, who has the resources, can participate in it's governance, even at the developer level (making the rules).  This is in contrast to governance of national currencies where making the rules usually involves being elected or appointed, and usually requires being a citizen of that nation in "good standing".
2. Bitcoin is percentage based, where 1 Bitcoin is regulated to be 1/21,000,000th of the total number of bitcoins.  Always.  (Unless the majority votes to change it.)
That's it.  Everything else about Bitcoin is seen in some national currencies, at least, if not most.  I mean, other than Bitcoin being only digital.  Which isn't really a good thing.

A ruler is the holder of the rules.  That container could be a human mind, a book, a mathematical formula, or anything else.




Um, obviously there are rules if we all have rules, literally.  The difference is that in a decentralized system, like your body (if you're a human), everyone has their own rules (genes and gene expressions), and in a centralized system everyone has the same core rules (like in Bitcoin or Christianity).


Yes on the single point of failure.  In Bitcoin's case, that's, obviously, the core code/software that maintains the ledger.  If the code is flawed, the whole system breaks.  Which is why there is a danger of a 51% attack destroying it, or a hard fork dividing it (which already happened, as we know).  And a decentralized system doesn't have to be a group intentionally working together to solve a problem.  Art is a decentralized system where folks aren't doing this.  Artists are independent, and doing their own thing, for their own reasons.  There's no shared problem with art, just a shared goal of communicating emotionally meaningful stuff.

Firstly, let's clear something up.  I'm in no way trying to prove a point.  That's silly.  There is no proof in science.  Just different theories, most of which are good for something, and none that are universally useful.  So let's move past the whole "proof" concept.  Secondly, this isn't really much of a theory, either, and more of me just explaining what the terms mean, and what they apply to.  I didn't invent these terms or their meaning.  I'm just aiming to help demonstrate some examples of them, to help clarify what they are and how they work.
And I'm very sorry if this seems confusing to you.  I don't do well trying to teach folks who aren't excited about exploring new ideas.  And, of course, teaching with nothing but text is pretty ineffective for human brains. But I can try to keep going, just know that I don't expect it will help.  


They aren't.  Individual ants are many cells, obviously, so they are more unpredictable than any of their individual cells would be.  But, as a whole, on average, we can predict what a collection of things does *if all of those things are operating with the same rules*.  This is literally why we can model ant colonies in computers, using simple math.
A human is a collection of 10,000 different species' cells (only two of which are human) all doing their own thing (different rules), and a whole lot more cells just in general than an ant, or even an ant colony.
A hierarchy would be a centralized system.  In decentralized systems all individuals are equal, essentially.  (Obviously in real, complex systems there will be multiple subsystems, which can be either centralized or decentralized, so we tend to talk about the overall system more than the subsystems.)
As for authority, I think a lot of folks get confused because they are thinking of humans actively using their power over others to make decisions for them.  But that's just one type of governance in a system.  Satoshi was the original human making centralized decisions about Bitcoin, controlling how it works more than anyone/thing else, but now the central governance/control/authority of Bitcoin is the software and the ledger itself, similar to how the US is governed by the central rule of the constitution, which isn't a human, though, like Bitcoin, was created by humans.
And remember, a fork is NOT Bitcoin.  If you try to use different rules, and go against consensus, you get kicked out.  That's the definition of a centralized system: everyone has to follow the same rules.  What you're describing is the decentralized nature of currencies as a whole, as in each currency has it's own rules, and doesn't have to follow the rules of any other currency.  (Though it certainly helps if they all share some rules for exchanging one for another.)

Yes, it was invented to allow peers to directly send one another money.  The culture at the time was looking to create ways to allow real people to support other real people in doing valuable work, be it a musician producing music, or a coder making freeware/shareware, or a blogger writing content, by having a way to have a monetary transaction without the complication, censorship, fees, etc., of a middleman service.
Now, I'm not Satoshi, so I don't know if he/she/they specifically were trying to solve this problem when Bitcoin was conceived, but that was the common theme that was running through the internet culture at the time.  There were many attempts to make tipping and  internet based money a norm.  Bitcoin was the one that broke out of the pack and took hold.
Is it possible that Satoshi was totally ignorant of this, and just randomly happened to invent the thing that so many folks were trying to create, or hoping someone else would create, but it seems unlikely.  And the fact that it's literally talking about "peer-to-peer" transactions in the very first sentence of the white paper suggests that this was, indeed, exactly what Bitcoin was attempting to do.

That's how it has to work, mathematically.  There has to be more people who can buy for the exchange rate to go up, which means that those who have it have to sell at least some.

With gold there are two centralized rules governing its value as a "currency", the first is obviously the fact that it has a specific atomic structure/composition, which can't be violated, or it becomes something not-gold.  The other is, obviously, whatever rules those who want to buy and sell gold are making.  There is literally a globally set price for gold.  Amusing, but true.
Now, obviously, the generation and allocation of gold is both controlled centrally and... decentralized as well.  
Gold coins are clearly money (a currency), and they are regulated by various governments, so that each has it's own specific value, and can only be minted by certain people/companies/whatever.  
Gold itself is simply a form of matter, which the universe generates in stars, I believe, so the rules of generation is centralized by the laws of physics, while allocation could be said to be decentralized, maybe, if it's possible for any star to make it, or not, and explode it into whatever direction it wants.  (Though, obviously, in the grand scheme of things, the laws of physics are the central control for *everything!*.  Heh.  So in this case, we are talking about subsystems, rather than the whole.)


If there is "a protocol" it's centralized.  Literally, that's what centralized is, having a single set of rules that all in the system follow.  I'm not sure how else to describe it.  It's so simple.  It's one of those things where it's so obvious, yet there's so many weird uses for the term that the obvious use becomes incomprehensible to folks.


In a democratic system, anyone can indeed change the rules, and the system as a whole (or some representative group, like congress, or the node runners of Bitcoin) vote on it.  One winner is selected from all options, and that become the new centralized authority (rules).


There is no thesis here.  Just offering some examples and trying to clarify definitions that have gotten lost in the weirdness of human culture/religion.
As for "anarchy dollars" you can call any centralized system anything you want.  Call it Jesus if you like.  But it won't change the geometrical functionality of how it works, with some core set of rules sitting in the center of control/governance.
The real decentralized values are in things like art, practical solutions (technology/politics), and philosophy/spirituality.  Real life is anarchy, which is why money is not.

With Bitcoin, you absolutely need permission of the collective to do transactions.  That's why it's super secure.  The central authority of Bitcoin (the ledger and code governing it's allocation and generation) is very, very rigid and not easily changed.  You can fork it without anyone's permission, but you can't actually do anything with Bitcoin without the majority's permission.
Which, for security purposes, is a good thing.

Rules are the rulers.  
Whether it's a constitution, or computer code, or just a shared idea, it's centralized if the rules apply to everyone, as opposed to a decentralized system where everyone uses their own rules, and can't force others to obey theirs.
It's decentralized if everyone has their own rules.
Again a really good example of a decentralized system is art, where there are no rules that all artists obey, yet it's still all art, it's still a system, even if there are no central/shared rules.  It's what we call an emergent system, rather than a top-down one.  Chaotic and unpredictable, yet still a system.
And Bitcoin is a great example of a centralized system, where you have to follow the rules, or be kicked out, as in the example of a transaction being rejected, or a hard fork being generated.  You are indeed compelled to follow the central rules of Bitcoin, or you're not going to be allowed in the Bitcoin system.
As for Bitcoin being governed, it is, otherwise it wouldn't exist.  Governance is simply how the rules are generated and maintained/enforced.  There have been changes to the original code, and the way those changes happen is a combination of plutocracy (buying Bitcoin and/or equipment/services to run mining and/or node machines), democracy (literally voting by using Bitcoin and a specific code/ledger), and meritocracy (developers, miners, node runners, and even owners learning how to use the system).

Bitcoin is a centralized system with some democracy, some meritocracy, and a little bit of plutocracy (for equipment and training), just like most national currencies.
But Bitcoin is, in contrast to national currencies, fully public, as it's open to *anyone* who has the resources to participate in the decision-making.  No need to be a citizen of some country, or even be human.
An actual anarchistic system wouldn't be able to have a currency, as a currency requires stable rules to keep everyone from generating their own, freely.

Thanks for the offer, but I'm not super interested in third party platforms for Bitcoin, especially ones that require access to my Reddit account. :-)
Interesting use of the term "asynchronous".  Both Bitcoin and that thing do require both the receiver and giver to consent to the transaction in a way, as with Bitcoin I have to give you my address, and you have to decide to send Bitcoin to it, while that one works in the opposite order, but still requires both.
I have a donation address on my [blog/podcast]( and I have gotten donations with it.  That's a lot easier for me than signing up for yet another service/process/software/whatever.

Women, or more accurately, brains with lower testosterone (probably), are less interested in gambling and more interested in using their resources to help others.
So, if we promote Bitcoin as a way to support a global project that is accessible by anyone (with a phone/computer at least) so that no one feels left out of the global economy, then perhaps more women will be interested in supporting Bitcoin.  For example, sending Bitcoin to regular people in Venezuela, so that they can use it to buy necessities, or support a school, appeals to the more nurturing types of humans, as compared to the more competitive, profiteering approach that most Bitcoin evangelists talk about, which turns the more feminine type thinkers off.

Socialism doesn't use an authoritarian figure, and instead uses collective decision-making, like democracy, but specifically aimed at helping those who previously haven't had enough to meet their basic needs well.
Once things are more equal, then Communism comes in, as an emergent property, where money is irrelevant, since everyone is freely doing what they love, and the natural diversity of life takes care of all the specialized roles that the system needs to flourish.  Socialism is the transition to freedom for all, rather than the current slavery of serving the anti-social monetary game.
Bitcoin is none of these, as it doesn't aim to support those who have too little, and mostly just expands the competitive advantage of those who already have lots of money.

I'm not the OP, but I calculated that for what I've spent on my couple of Bitcoin I've got, I have spent an average of about $2500 per BTC.
(This does include a trade, though, where I got some Stellar Lumens for free (when they were starting out and doing promos on Reddit) and then when the exchange rate went crazy high last year, I traded it for Bitcoin.  If I ignore that, I spent about $2700 per Bitcoin.)
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:21:33
I think you're confused about what Bitcoin is.
The reason Bitcoin is so secure is that it's global, public, open source, and controlled though consensus (permission by the majority).  You can't just mess with it.  It's a collaborative government.  Heavily centralized for reliability, rather than being chaotic and unreliable.
As I said, you can always make your own fork, but it's no longer Bitcoin.  Bitcoin itself is quite sturdy and hard to attack.

It's impressive how backwards/confused many humans are when it comes to investing.  I'm pretty sure 8 year olds would be better at investing in Bitcoin.  Buy low, sell high seems obvious to me, but then when I tell folks that, they start asking all kinds of complicated questions and say that no one can predict the future and that it's impossible to time the market.
But all you need to do is literally buy when it's lower than it's been for a while, and sell when it's higher than you bought it at.  If you feel desperate enough to sell when you're at a loss, then you invested more than you could afford to lose (or keep tied up for a while).

Yes, and that is held in escrow, and potentially never given back if someone decides that there are "protocol violations".
Which literally means that there are rules **in between** me sending you Bitcoin and you getting the Bitcoin.  Thus, this is a middleman protocol.
Can you not see the difference between me sending you Bitcoin directly (peer-to-peer) and me having to download software, sign up, make a deposit, and follow someone else's rules, before I can send you Bitcoin?
I mean, I'm sure you see that.  So either you're trolling.  Or you don't understand how Bisq works.  Or you are confused about what peer-to-peer (direct) transactions are.

There wouldn't be a decentralized blockchain. That would make no sense.
The simplest way to think about systems is that centralized ones are predictable, because everyone is following the same (central) rules, while a decentralized system is highly unpredictable/chaotic, due to everyone making up their own rules for themselves.
I it's reliable and stable, in it's basic function, it's centralized.  Bitcoin is extra centralized with it's very, very, very rigid rules for how the money is generated and allocated.  Bitcoin is a centralized system.
Art, on the other hand, is wild and crazy and you never know what will happen when someone decides to create a new piece of art. art is a decentralized system.

You ignored what I wrote.
The miners are the ones who decide if transactions can happen at all and keep the ledger.  No miners, no Bitcoin.  You can scream your private key at the top of your lungs but if there are no computers running the software to hear you and care about what you're saying, you're not going to be able to do anything with your imaginary points.
Yes, the miners have to follow certain rules, and those rules were made by one guy (or possibly more).  So his past self controls the miners.  But without them, his past self can't do a damned thing either.

You don't understand what Bisq is, apparently.
It's impressive how every time I helpfully explain the simple difference between peer-to-peer transactions and transactions with an exchange in the middle, someone says "Oh no!  That's not how Bisq works!" and then I have to waste my time and go to the FAQ and copy and paste their explanation of what their rules are, and it's just kinda weird.  Ya know?
It's literally AN EXCHANGE.  It's a middleman service.  Or protocol.  Or whatever you want to call it.  Instead of me just sending Bitcoin to your wallet, we have to install a third party software, sign up, follow the rules (including making a deposit for escrow), and THEN, and only then, can I send you the money.

Reality is indeed fractal, with every subsystem of it being either centralized or decentralized (they are indeed binary).  
Software is obviously centralized, as it's literally a central set of rules for doing something.  While the collection of all software ever written is decentralized, as there are no shared rules governing them all, except, of course, the physical infrastructure of coding information (the laws of physics), which is centralized.
Bitcoin and Bisq and any other rule-based systems are centralized, but what sets some of these apart from other centralized systems is that they are fully public, open source, global, and usually more directly democratic than more mainstream options (that are governed by private, or semi-private, groups like the US Fed).
I think folks like to use the term "decentralized" even though it doesn't apply, because it sounds novel and interesting, which it is, sort of, and Bitcoin and Bisq are novel and interesting.  But they aren't novel and interesting in the same way.  I also guess that some folks were thinking that the distributed nature of Bitcoin and Bisq, being essentially in the "cloud" as opposed to some rack of servers in a single building makes these "decentralized".  Which, technically, it does.  But then so are national currencies and corporate middlemen banks.
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:25:01
Exchanges are bad anyway, as they are middlemen being preferred by people who ignore the whole point of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer design.
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:52:13
Centralized means that the rules are the same for all elements in a system.  It's predictable.
Decentralized means that everyone is doing their own thing, and it's chaotic and unpredictable.
This is what these terms mean in the field of systems theory and governance and biology.
It would be far better for folks who are interested in Bitcoin to be more logical and clear about what we mean when we talk about the differences between Bitcoin and other currencies.  The benefit is that Bitcoin is global and public/open to all.  That, plus the solid centralization that makes it very hard to change the rules (very different from national currencies).

And I did buy a lot in the $4000's and $5000's this year.  But I also just spent the last of my extra savings recently, when it went down to the $8000 range.  
But, generally, I'm lucky that I started seriously investing in late 2016, before it hit $1000 (the second time).

I think you just made an assumption far beyond what I said.  There is nothing misleading about pointing out that using someone else's software and/or hardware is putting your trust in them to take care of you.  So, unless you're using a paper wallet (which still involves using someone else's software at least to generate the seed words, probably), you're going to need to pay attention to whom you're putting your trust in.
The one thing about Bitcoin is that you get to make your own decisions, which also means that you're responsible if you make a mistake.

Erm, why do you think people are playing the Bitcoin game?  To make a lot of money.  *This* is "egocentrism", as you say.  The whole competitive game where you want to make money while others lose money, which is what investing in Bitcoin requires, is not even good for the self, really, since it makes you separate from others, rather than connected to others.

Anyone CAN try to steal anything you have, especially if you have more than most others, and they are jealous and desperate.  But the reality is that getting someone's Bitcoin if they take even reasonable precautions, is far harder than stealing most things of value.

The antiquated part is the competitive game approach to life.  It's essentially the ideological equivalent of trying to be a dinosaur (big and dangerous and hoardy and overly independent in an ecosystem).  Or, alternately, it's like how single celled organisms worked before they started combining their efforts and becoming complex organisms like us animals.
Life is a game, it's got rules, and their are goals, and winning means healthy continuation of life, while losing means death (of everyone).  It's NOT academic, it's everything.  The old way of playing was as a competitive game, but even with overly simplified and biased game theory theories, collaboration is the long term approach that results in the most wins.  The whole idea of money/currency as a way of life is absolutely the disaster.  The biggest disaster ever.

Bitcoin is a currency.  Look for someone who wants to accept it, or ask those you want to buy from to accept it, and help them understand why it's so useful to have, as opposed to national currencies.
I mean, seriously, why would you buy Bitcoin if you didn't want to use it?

Under a certain amount of money a week, there is no complex ID stuff needed beyond you giving them a phone number and a name, I believe.  LibertyX is how I've been getting Bitcoin for a while, since the online exchange I was using booted me off because they didn't want to do business in the state I'd registered in originally anymore.
The tradeoff is that the fees are now stupid high.  8%.  I had originally been paying them 3% when I first started using them a couple of years ago, but places just keep going up.  Which definitely turns me off.  But no other exchanges online let me buy Bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2019-12-12 00:45:49


Um, I think you're confused.  If you try to double spend, which is obviously against the rules of Bitcoin, your transaction will be rejected.  We are indeed compelled to follow the rules of Bitcoin's core software code and ledger.  Or we're banished or refused service.


Yes, that's what a centralized governance does, make it so that there is only one set of rules for the system, meaning that freedom to do what you want doesn't exist.  You can't stop the central rules.  You can only leave the system.
A decentralized system has no central rules, and no one can kick anyone out for being different.  As in my example of art.  I can't kick out another artist for not making art the way I want art made.  And vice versa.

I'm not sure why anyone is bothered by this enough to downvote me or tell me I need to do more research.
It's a centralized service that acts as a middleman between peers to secure transactions with a security deposit and, if you want, an arbiter.  If you don't follow their rules, they can take your security deposit.

I wish people would start calling Bitcoin something more like the world's first truly public, global currency, instead of the misleading "decentralized".  (A decentralized system is one where everyone uses their own rules, rather than having shared, i.e. centralized, rules that all follow.)
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:52:25
If it's a system (with multiple elements) it has governance.
Governance is the process that is used to make decisions.  It can be centralized (shared rules) using democratic, meritocratic, totalitarian, or even random selection, or it can be bottom-up, emergent, decentralized (free-form chaos) where everyone just does their own thing and the result is unpredictable (as in a living human body).
@_date: 2019-12-02 19:13:25
Instead of me giving you Bitcoin...
Bisq is me and you using Bisq's system to get my Bitcoin to you, if, and only if, the system allows it.  There is an extra layer of rules we have to follow for the transaction to happen.
It's fine if you want some "safety" offered by a third party, who controls things, in case someone does something unexpected/unwanted, but that's what we have with all other currencies.  Bitcoin was made to be peer-to-peer, with no need to follow anyone else's rules, except the rules of the currency itself.
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:24:03
Yes, we all know that.
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:11:41
Well, not to be free, as Bitcoin is literally money, but to be able to give and receive money without a middleman.
But we are so dependent on "professionals" taking care of us, and so afraid to actually interact directly with other people, that we fall back into the middleman approach, using exchanges instead of using Bitcoin to buy and sell things with the other humans we normally would want to buy and sell things with.
**TL;DR** Bitcoin is supposed to be peerr-to-peer, not peer-to-middleman-to-peer.

You have a weird concept of commandments...
My top 3 rules of Bitcoin:
1. Do your own research.  You are 100% responsible for your actions.  (There are no guarantees, and some of life is down to luck, but beyond that you can't let others tell you what to do if you care about the outcome.)
2. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
3. Buy low sell high.  (Relative, obviously.  That might mean you have to hodl for years.)
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:03:03
It's the more mathematical and systems' theory and government meaning of centralized.
What most folks mean when they say that Bitcoin is "decentralized" is actually that it's public and global.  US$ and Bitcoin are both centralized in their governance, as they have a central set of rules, which are democratically, meritocratically, and plutocratically generated and maintained.  But at least Bitcoin is fully open/public and global so that anyone at all can become involved as long as they have the resources and interest to do so.

Obviously reality is complex, and ultimately it's all centralized, as we have the laws of physics governing all of the matter and energy in reality, as far as we know, but there are subsystems that are either centralized, where all parts are governed by the same core rules in some notable way, or decentralized, having all of the parts doing their own thing, with their own unique rules, leading to unpredictable/emergent behavior.
The infrastructure of both the internet and our own body's nervous system is centralized, with all of the parts needing to have at least some shared rules, as you point out, to actually connect stuff from here to there.  But on top of that infrastructure, we can have either a decentralized set of information flowing, or we can centralize it to be only certain, regulated types of content.
I see that the more decentralized our information systems are allowed to be, be they organic or synthetic, the more resilient and efficient they become, as specialization is encouraged (and allowed) with each brain cell being free to regulate itself, and share information when it makes sense to it, rather than by some authority of some sort, be it democratic (what a lot of folks here seem to think "decentralized" means, though they ignore the reality that the US government and it's monetary system is also democratic and run by many, many different individuals, far more than probably run Bitcoin even), or totalitarian, or any other way to get consensus on the centralized rules.

My plan is to have enough of us regular people buy into Bitcoin to make the dinosaur corporations feel the need to take it over, and while that happens, we quietly and slowly sell of of ours off, use it to create resilient communities so that we don't need the dinosaurs anymore, and they just die off from having gorged themselves on empty calorie delusions of grandeur, allowing us small, furry animals to flourish, in our own weird little ways.

It is what a centralized system is.  In the normal meaning, anyway.
If there are shared rules, that all must obey, or be kicked out of the system, as in Bitcoin, then it's centralized, literally central rules.  All democracies and meritocracies and authoritarian systems are centralized.
A decentralized system is one in which everyone has different rules, but they are all still connected in some way.  Like how art is.  Art doesn't require anyone to do anything specific, and there are no general rules that all artists follow, yet art is still a system, which we can generally describe as a single thing (i.e., "art").
Some folks like to call Bitcoin "decentralized" but it isn't, logically, since there is literally a central ledger and software that all must use.  What Bitcoin is, as compared to national currencies, is fully public, open source, and global.  Anyone who has the resources can run a node, mine, buy and use Bitcoin, and even help develop it.  Which is different from national currencies where you can only vote for representatives who make the decisions (or appoint others to), if you are a citizen with the right to vote.

It comes down to two things, as I see it. One, your goal, as stated, is to narrow your beliefs down to a single "true" perspective, while my goal is to [add all of the different perspectives]( together to see things in a more well rounded way.  And two, if you honestly are curious about exploring other perspectives, you need to do so on your own, rather than expect someone else to do your homework for you.


I am not.  But you certainly tried to dismiss me pretty much right from the start, along with others here, by calling Bitcoin a scam, and acting like I am "parroting" what others say.


I'm directing the discussion to something important that might help folks understand how systems, such as Bitcoin, evolve.  If you don't understand the science/math of systems, you won't understand how life changes over time.  So I'm offering some options for exploring the topic, so that you and others might have a way to look at the world more effectively, so you aren't surprised at life so much.

Except that no system is as global or has as much passion from diverse areas of human society as Bitcoin.  Which is why it's the primary beta testing system for such a system.

It's definitely an interesting option.  Though Bitpay is obviously not what most folks who are more deeply involved in the crypto community want to use.

If you are a religious type, looking for an authority to tell you what is "the truth", that's ok.  You do whatever feels right to you.
Personally, I'm a scientist who looks to combine all the different datasets/perspectives to understand the whole in a robust and multidimensional way.  I don't look to elevate any single perspective above any other one, as that would ignore all of the other data, and leave me with a single-minded, biased view.  But that's just me.
And thankfully our society is becoming less controlled, not more.  We're moving towards more diversity, more decentralization, more collaboration amongst different, specialized, individuals, as evolution did on a organism scale before, and is now happening on a planetary level now.
Evolution is what's "wrong with people these days", thankfully.  But I can see if you're a more traditional religious type (be it more modern religions like money and geeky gizmos and academia or the more old fashioned religions of authoritarian rule of humanity), evolution will seem scary and weird.  Entropy is what causes this movement towards more randomness/chaos/unpredictability/weirdness/freedom/fun.  If you're scared of entropy, then you're going to be scared of evolution too.

Those percentages are relative.  If you look at things from an exponential growth side (which is the normal way things grow), then it's far less of a percentage drop.  It's very much well within the normal variation of a growing thing.

But we could choose to take all of our resources that we have and share them with our friends, family, neighbors, and communities, using them creatively to serve our needs directly, instead of giving everything we have to the corporations/governments and demanding that they serve our needs in exchange (with poor results).

Never rent unless you're desperate.  It's a huge waste of resources, as you get absolutely nothing in the long run.
Avoid mortgages as well (avoid credit) if possible.
Aim to pool your resources with others to own something that you can improve over time, while using.
For a temporary option, if you want to save, look for a place that will let you live for free, or in exchange for something you normally do for free (house sitting, childcare, farming, office work, making art, whatever).  Or, yeah, just get whatever you can as cheaply as possible, if that's not an option, and save.  In Bitcoin and/or whatever else you like.

Tell them that Bitcoin is just as shitty a game as all currencies.  Those who make the money (as in controlling the generation and distribution of money initially) are the ones to make the big profits, while everyone else is left scrambling for scraps.  
But Bitcoin is a bit more interesting, because it's not only global, open-source, and powered by anyone who has the resources to do so and wants to (rather than having to be hired by a company or government), but also because it's testing out a new database system for tracking resources globally.  Eventually Bitcoin's system will be used for something even better, more collaborative, more helpful to the whole world, in a positive-sum sort of way.
In the meantime, Bitcoin is just another way to play the competitive game, with some extra points that you might happen to have.  As long as you're not risking more than you're comfortable either losing, or having out of commission for a few years, then you're good.  And you can tell your family members this.

Ok, you have described two different kinds of centralized systems, one being fully democratic (equal votes on the centralized rules) and one with democratic voting where not everyone gets to vote.
So you don't even see the fully decentralized systems at all from what I can tell.  That's not surprising.  Decentralization, aka emergent, bottom-up, evolving systems, isn't taught in schools or popularly explained in the media.  So folks just look at things that are a little different than what they are used to with the really aggressive centralized systems.
As for the French, yeah, obviously the "official French language" can't be forced on anyone.  No system that actually exists in the real world can ever be purely centralized or decentralized, since life is chaotic and random and governed by entropy.  But French is the only language I've ever heard of that has a government agency that officiates the language aggressively.  (French Canadians have gotten a bit of that as well, being very offensive about forcing French on Canadian businesses and such.)  
Here's a bit of a summary for you: 


As for the bitcoin discussion, I'm not totally clear on where the dividing line is, but I accept that you say that there is some wiggle room, which is useful, but still not how a real decentralized (emergent, bottom-up) system works.


That's only what happens in a centralized system, and it's not that I would be kicking myself out at all.  If I want to make up new rules for English, and still be an English speaker, I could.  I would not at all be kicked out of the system that English speaking if I started saying things like I already quoted, even if you couldn't understand them.  But I know you don't see that for some weird reason.  Or you do see it but feel the need to defend yourself from truly decentralized systems, like the English language.
If someone says:
"smashes a duzza out side woolies, woolies trolly guy: skoin on m8"
You and I might not have much of a clue what they are saying, and some old fuddy duddies might even scream "Speak proper English!", but it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, it's still English, because in an actually decentralized system, the rules are diverse, and different for different individuals, and participation in the system is self-defined, not governed by others.  You have no control over what someone else who decides that what they are speaking is English.  If they say they are speaking English, they are.  Even if there is a vote and the majority, even everyone else, says "you're not speaking English there pal" that's not how a decentralized system works.  Even those on the edges of the system are a part of the system if they choose to be.  There is no voting when it comes to who is and is not in the system.  There can be voting on how popular certain rules are, as in dictionaries and style guides and common usage, but those aren't central controls, but emergent behaviors, instead.


Centralized governance  But more democratic than some other centralized systems.  And decentralized labor (compared to Micros**t).


Bitcoin has been aiming at decentralized labor.  Not decentralized rules.  People want to be able to be able to vote on the rules of the currency.  They don't, generally, want everyone to be free to make up their own rules (which is seen in the impressively passionate war against the Bitcoin Cash folks), so they don't want a fully decentralized currency where Bitcoin Cash would be a part of Bitcoin as a subset, just like Australian slang and chatspeak are parts of the English language, even if a majority of English-speaking voters think that they shouldn't be. :-)
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:23:01
It uses far less than most things humans do.  Supposedly it uses about the same amount as Christmas lights/decorations.
Also, Bitcoin is actually the beta testing system for creating a global resource tracking logistics network, so that as soon as we get rid of this competitive point scoring game as a way of life, and embrace the natural order of things, with a collaborative game that has a goal of [evolution of the Earth]( (higher fitness of all life, as a whole), the system will have been fully tested, challenged, and fixed up to be the most efficient system out there, so that free resources can flow easily from where they are offered to where they are most useful/needed, so that we can all get what we need to be our best, mentally and physically.
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:29:30
I presume it has to do with the need to have a more reliable database/tracking system.  When you only have one individual (human, robot, whatever) reporting on what's where, it's easy to make mistakes, but with many different individuals combining their information, you get a more accurate and reliable database.

If you don't pay off a debt, then it's no longer a debt, and you're not a slave to it.
I went through a whole ton of crap about a decade ago, where my whole life came crashing down on me, and I became under threat of homeless.  I used credit cards to eat and pay for buses and my phone and such, and finagled some housing temporarily.  Eventually I ran out of credit, and stopped having any money at all, basically, and became officially homeless, but at least I'd been able to live moderately comfortably for a while before that happened.  I defaulted on those credit cards because for a decade I earned about $1000 a year, but at least that temporary debt allowed me to transition slowly into abject poverty, instead of being forced into it "cold turkey".  That debt probably saved my life.

Spend and replace is the best way to support Bitcoin right now.
You're spending the old money anyway, right?  So buy Bitcoin with it, and spend that.
You don't lose any Bitcoin, and you help make it more useful.  Plus, right now, it's a great time for folks to get Bitcoin, since it will (presumably) go up again, and that will make them happy they accepted it.  (As compared to spending at an all time high.)

"Practicality", as you seem to imagine it, is not how the laws of physics (entropy) work.  Reality is weird and creative and chaotic.

That seems silly.  Bitcoin has a purpose, and is well designed.  Adoption takes time.  Plus, we need to figure out how to help people get it in the actual peer-to-peer way, as intended, instead of being stuck having to go though exchanges.  Most folks who want Bitcoin can't get it, or don't have a good way of getting it.  So even when the really want it, most folks don't get it.  We need to fix that.

It's the opposite of scary, as it's exciting to have an extra opportunity to buy before it goes way up.

Also, if you can, give needy folks food that's high nutrients and expensive, like a good trail mix, or a (vegan) nutritional shake or smoothie, or just a hearty salad.  My absolute staple for carrying around with me is Trader Joe's "Go Raw Trail Mix".  It's like $6 for a pound of nuts and raisins.  TJ's also has the almond milk chai nutritional shake for a few dollars that is very satisfying when you're really hungry.
The food that most folks can get for free/cheap is mostly processed starches (breads, rice, pasta, corn), which fills you up, but leaves you nutritionally deficient.  Fruits are ok to give, but they don't last if you don't have a fridge, and they are often easy to get for free, as the stores get rid of them regularly when they start going a little bad.

The majority of humans definitely do not like authoritarianism and big brother rule.  Or mob rule.  They just don't know how to do anything else, because that's what their whole lives have been lived within.
They don't know how to be independent and/or interdependent.  They only know how to be dependent (on some authority figure).  But they know that a centralized, top-down, inequality-of-power system is wrong, and would very much love to escape from it.

That's what I've been saying all along.  Bitcoin is a centralized system. As is Bitcoin Cash.  They are all parts of another, larger system, which is decentralized.  But I'm not talking about "currencies".  I'm talking about Bitcoin.  And while we already agree that the labor in Bitcoin is decentralized, I'm also explaining how the rules/governance is different from a decentralized system.
There is no "solution" to Bitcoin, since it is what it is.  That's like asking for a solution to making the sun a toaster oven.  It's nonsensical.  We can't make Bitcoin decentralized, because it's not.  Making it into something else would make it something else.
But currencies in general, as you already pointed out, are decentralized.  So if you want a more decentralized monetary economy, then just make more currencies.  And because it's a decentralized system NO ONE can kick your currency out.  Bitcoin can't get kicked out of the currency system.  As long as one individual wants to use it, it's part of the system.  There is no central authority.  See the difference?

Most folks who are curious about Bitcoin find the process of getting some far too big of a challenge.  Only the most determined and lucky are able to get some.  Wait until folks start really doing the peer-to-peer thing, and start helping their friends, neighbors, family, etc., get Bitcoin directly by giving it to them (or trading it to them for something else).  Then adoption will go nuts.

Maybe you should share your thoughts here with the folks working on blockchain tech, including the folks teaching it at MIT.
Also, this looks like a heavily centralized, closed system, rather than diverse, independent computers coming together.
Both approaches are useful, and have different use cases.  In the wild, you need the diversified system, since each locality (on the planet) will have it's own different kinds of devices and coders and whatnot, all making the measurements/tracking.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:41:53
One more interesting sidebar here that you inspired me to explore more deeply:
It's less about the difference between one part of a system and their fellow parts — as in the difference between "This sfhasdj is ash ajbawb deliahsdjakashdjk!" and current English vs the difference between "This chili is blooshingly delicious!" and current English, and more about how well something fits in with the other parts.  Which is why we can have the mitochondrial DNA and the regular DNA that make up the official part of the homosapien species, even though they are totally different.  
Decentralized systems are all about diversity, which is why English has all these different words when compared to Bitcoin which has all the same basic patterns of inputs and outputs (something about constructing and deconstructing primes, I believe, as the core process).  Yes, English has some basic centralized rules that probably are related to the simple functions of life, with nouns (matter) and verbs (energy) and ways those things interact (adjectives and adverbs), and some basic concepts relating to how we make noises with our bodies (mostly mouths) and/or write in text, but there are no rules for what specific letters/sounds we could make up for any concept.  
BUT... there are things that fit into the current set of words better than others, which is why blooshingly fits in better than ajbawb.  Yes, it's partly because it's less dramatically different from other words we already have, but it's also because it just fits well *around* the other words in the sentence.  It's like a puzzle piece that fits into a space in between other pieces nicely.  Though I imagine that you could find a nice sentence that ajbawb would fit into pretty well, too, and it too could become a perfectly lovely English word.
'Twas brillig and the slithy toves

I would LOVE to help create a universal categorization system.  I have a basic strategy (Pascal's triangle), but definitely can't do it myself.
This is on my list of things to do after I'm not homeless anymore.  (It's been over a decade, off and on.)
I keep thinking that someone at the MIT Media Lab would be good for this.  But I also have a more immediate and personal project that will likely involved a more specific use of this idea, and a more basic one, so that might be the introduction to a more universal design.  (I'm looking to make an app/website/whatever that helps guide humans in understanding their most important stories of who they are and what they want, and then making those stories appealing for the world, so that everyone can be more known and appreciated.)

You might be underestimating things here.  Spreading FUD is what makes the price go down, which is what the big bulls want, so that they can buy back in, after having sold at the all time high (or whatever), and rake in even more profit.

The sad thing is that at least the other presenters that emerged out of the Daily Show are often far more accurate in news reporting than the shows purported to be "real" news.
Probably because the comedy shows are funnier when true, and thus it's easier to do what they do honestly, while "real" news shows have to keep their viewers' attention some other way, usually by making them angry or scared, and real life isn't that bad, usually.  So they make shit up, or exaggerate in pretty fucked up ways.

In a decentralized system there isn't organization from the center out.  That's the whole point.  It's decentralized, and there are many, many different "centers" sometimes every individual is it's own center, yet... YET... it is still a system, because it functions as a whole.  As in currencies, which, *as a whole*, are "a way to keep score, in some kind of quantified game involving resource collection".  There is no centrally organized rule for all currencies, be they Monopoly money, US $, Japanese ¥, ฿, "Honey Money" (which I handmade out of shrinky dink plastic when my husband and I first moved in together to use to "buy" big favors from one another), but they are nonetheless part of the category of *currencies*.  That's what a decentralized system is (on my planet): a collection of different individuals/groups who are operating with their own rules, and form an even larger group that has a shared goal, intentionally or not.  It's a chaotic cluster of things from which something notable emerges to make it a system, without any central governance.  No one could have predicted that pieces of paper, shells, beads, circles of metal, or even just numbers in a computer program, would be traded and collected by vast swaths of humans, as if their lives depended upon it.  Yet this system of trading quantified symbols of value did indeed evolve, out of random practices, and with random rules.
As for suggestions about exploring the field.  I can't really think of any especially good individuals/sources right now.  Looking into emergence, especially in biology, might be useful.  
Stephen Wolfram's "cellular automata" shows how a few different, simple, rules can combine to create complex, emergent patterns that generate all kinds of fascinating systems, which is fun to play with.  He doesn't really explain them much, but they at least are something to start exploring, if you really want to.  It is chaotic, yet shows how chaos can generate meaningful patterns out of "nothing".

Rather than reputation systems, we can aim for freedom to do what we most want to do, which is naturally creating, exploring, and sharing the most awesome stuff (that increases the fitness of future generations of life, in some way).  We're programmed to do good things, because that's what life/evolution needs us to do.  But in order to do the best work, we need the best resources, so focusing on doing what we love will naturally lead to us being able to do more of what we love, because what we love doing is helping people be healthier.
So we don't need to judge others as to whether they are "worthy" of something, we just need to ask if they want something that we want to give.
It seems to easy.  And it sort of is, compared to the insanity of the various score keeping games that we've invented (money, grades, votes, likes/karma points, etc.) and convinced ourselves are fun games to play.
Real life is much easier and more natural to play, because it's what we were made to do.

You can call what your body does anarchy, since each cell has it's own rules and is free to do whatever it wants to do, but it's the only thing that evolution has demonstrated to be, so far, 100% effective at keeping life going indefinitely.
The real secret is the freedom bit.  As soon as you try to control others, you lose.  Because nature programs us (using DNA) to want to do the things that the whole system of life needs done.  Not perfectly, but with a goal of improving life for future generations as much as possible, given the available resources and environment.  When we repress those natural instincts, we end up with a disaster, and everyone miserable.  That's what we have now.

That's a centralized (top-down) controlled system.  An emergent, aka, decentralized system is... emergent.  The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.  As in the human body, which doesn't have any central rules, and all the different species/DNA and expressions of those DNA in each different cell, operate under their own rules, yet the collection is a *whole*, not just a pile of cells.  Why some collections of things are a whole (emergent) system and some are just collections isn't something science can really say, from what I can tell.  Some things just fit together really well, without anything forcing them to, unlike, say a nation (where folks are not free to come and go as they please, citizen-wise).  I mean, the laws of physics obviously apply to even chaotic systems like our bodies, and currencies, but other than that, they are indeed chaotic and not "intentionally" controlled.
As for Stephen Wolfram's cellular automata, it's far more complex than just the game of life stuff.  His whole book A New Kind of Science is free on the internet.  It's on his main website for Wolfram Alpha, if you search for it.  It's a huge book, and fascinating, though a bit much for most people.  I read maybe 10% of it.  And that was pretty impressive. :P
Note that the rules in cellular automata are different for each cell type.  There is no central control, just a simple rule that each different cell follows, which is what I'm talking about in decentralized systems.  Each individual has their own rules, and no one else can tell them what to do or how to do it, yet somehow the different individuals doing their own thing can generate some kind of interesting behavior that you wouldn't expect from the individuals on their own.  That's a chaotic, as opposed to "intentional" system.

But once we work out most of the kinks and make it ready for prime time, it will be ready for us to track anything we want to track, from extra apples in my orchard, that I don't want to go to waste, to all the weird critters you might crochet as a meditative hobby, to fancy new phones the neighbor's Scout troop is building as part of their computer tech badge.

Free speech is good for everyone, as is learning to welcome critique of said speech, but when you make speech a competitive game where the "winners" get some kind of points (money, votes, grades, etc.) you naturally set up a situation where people will bribe (pay) others to elevate their speech above others, as a way to gain winnings.

Basically, Bitcoin has to go fully global, with more than 50% adoption for humanity, before it will be ready to crash the corporate system, which will let the monetary meme die out.

As for French, didn't I already talk about it being a centralized language?   If not, you could have just asked.  France is pretty funny. They literally call their the people appointed to the [central authority on the official language of French]( "the immortals".  Such drama! 
Maybe you are French not drunk. :P (I'm a little French, supposedly.  Or maybe just Canadian...)
And if there is a vote in a system, to agree on accepting something, it's centralized.  On my planet.  If someone else can tell me which code to use, it's centralized.  Only if I can use a different code (which still fits well with the other code, in some not-easy-to-measure-way) and still be part of the system is it decentralized.
I agree that Bitcoin is better than Micros**t, because the labor and votes are more open to the public (rather than being only made by those the company hires), but both are still centralized in the fact that there is only one set of code allowed at a time.  I do see that you said:


Which is why I specifically asked (yet you fully ignored!):


Now maybe you are saying that nodes/miners can tweak the code a bit, and still be allowed to be in the Bitcoin system.  That's good.  How different can the code be and still be accepted?  Obviously it can't be totally different, but if there is a lot more wiggle room than I thought, I'd see what you mean, to some extent.
Also, note that I only just now saw your large Edit from the previous comment.  You did that after I saw the comment and started replying to it.  That would have been useful to see earlier.  Maybe next time just do a separate comment if you have that much to add.  (Ninja edits are usually ok.  But that clearly took you a while, which is why it didn't made it to me.)

Like some others are saying, if you really want Bitcoin, you need to get your own wallet, with your own address and private key (it's a password that ONLY YOU should know, either a string of numbers and letters, or a set of many words) not some investment bank company.
You might not be able to transfer (use) what you've got there.  Which means it's not actually yours, and it's not actually even Bitcoin, possibly.  You might be "protected" from your own fallibility (losing your key, getting hacked, etc.), but it's not really in the spirit of Bitcoin, which was designed to use peer-to-peer.  With you exchanging it with others you know in person, for products and services, or just as a gift.

The more you try to contain information (energy) the more entropy works to destroy that containment.  "Privacy" goes against the laws of physics, so when you try to attain it, it hurts, just like trying to jump off a building and expecting gravity to not pull you down.
Better to be aware that everything outside your body, everything!, is free and belongs to the universe at large, not you.

We're just dicking around with semantics now.  My point is that the people who are running the software need at least someone who can develop new software if they want to change the software.  It's mostly irrelevant to the discussion as a whole.
The discussion as a whole is that Bitcoin is centralized, in that the control of the rules of the game is top-down, where an individual or group can decide what the rules are for the whole system and that if you don't abide by those rules, you will be kicked out.  (Unless you become the centralized controllers, as in the democratic process we're talking about here.)

There are two kinds of genomes that are the literal homosapiens species, the normal one and the mitochondrial one.
Then there are the thousands of other species that make up our bodies (many, if not most, of which we wouldn't function well without).  It's called [the human microbiome](  We aren't a single species of cells.  We are a collaborative.  
And then each cell has it's own unique expression of the genes, which is where the specialization comes in, for heart cells, liver cells, brain cells, blood cells, etc.  The genes are the same, but how they get used is different.  Each individual cell in the human body has it's own set of rules.  And the other cells don't have any control over what those rules are.  A brain cell can't tell a liver cell to change it's rules.  And no one kicks out a liver cell for not being some other "better" kind of cell.  (There are some extreme situations, of course, since no system is ever 100% anything.)


It is very unusual, and absolutely not free.  Except in some extreme situations of asylum and refuges from war zones, it costs money to change your country, and even when fees are waived, it costs paperwork and a whole lot of stress.  Even going on vacation is often a challenge and usually requires being approved by some centralized authority, and costs money, at least with an ID/Passport, and sometimes a visa.


Well, cellular automata are mathematical models.  So they aren't real systems, I guess.  They attempt to show what real systems can look like, and how they can behave, though.  Each system that is modeled has certain constraints (how many dimensions it has, usually 2, and some basic "laws of physics" about how cells can affect one another over time, usually a change in color or maybe shape) which mean that the kinds of rules that can be used by each cell are limited.  Aside from that, a cellular automata model can have any of the possible rules and still be included the model, and those rules are totally independent from the rules of other cells.  (Unless the rules that a cell uses involve other's rules, of course.)


No individuals of any sort really ever make up their own rules, on my planet.  This gets into the whole idea of "free will", so this might be a bit more than you were expecting in such a conversation.  But I'll go there anyway, since you asked.  Unless you want to inject some kind of multiple level universe/multiverse/something-or-other where things inside this universe can be controlled by things on a higher level, allowing them to function beyond the way particles, atoms, molecules, proteins, cells, organisms, etc. are made to function by the laws of nature.  The unique rules I follow are, as far as I know, "made up" by my random combination of matter and energy and path through space~time.  I am essentially a character in a movie, but a 4D one, where I experience things in all of my human senses.  (But the movie isn't one that was written/directed by another individual, as far as I can tell, but is simply one of the infinite random patterns of matter and energy moving though existence.  Though there could be some "writer" on another level changing how I'm written in a non-random way.  It's just not something that feels useful to me.  I just stick with randomness for now.  
Which means that ultimately all of the individual's rules, everywhere, everywhen, always, are essentially just different expressions of the same rules that the whole universe/multiverse/whatever has.  And since it's all a part of the same ultimate system (all of reality) each individual does have it's own rules, on the detailed level, while fitting into the same system as every other, unique, individual, with no perfect duplicates, ever.

Yeah, a 100% perfect mathematical system that contains all possible combinations is the one represented by Pascal's triangle.  Pascal's triangle itself is just the superficial information, but you can use it to generate all possible patterns (especially easy if you do it in binary).

How evolution happens is random, at the detailed level.  So there is no walking through it until we actually walk through it. 
But as I see it now, the younger generations will increasingly see how irrational and arbitrary all the various score keeping systems are as they watch cryptocurrencies fluctuate wildly, and national/corporate currencies lose value, and as they see "money" as nothing more than numbers on screens, like in a video game.
And, of course, as we continue to develop high quality technology to do the things that we don't actually want to do, it will free us up from the slavery (in the form of "employment" just to "make ends meet") that we've been convinced is the only way life can work.  So we'll start, as we already have, looking at other options.  
Unconditional Basic Income is yet another symptom of this transition, as we look to figure out how to make sure that everyone has their basic physical needs met, at the very bottom of Maslow's hierarchy, so that folks are at least able to function at a minimal level of mental and physical health, and can focus on making healthy relationships and contributing interesting work to the larger whole, as they start to become self-transcendent and want to serve a larger purpose in life.

Um, no.  Each cell does it's own thing.  Each cell has it's own genes, and expression of those genes.  There is no central set of genes controlling all of the cells.  And there are many different sets of genes (our bodies have about 10,000 species in them).
There is absolutely no central control of a human body.  We do have centralized infrastructure, of course (the nervous system and circulatory system), but control is bottom-up, not top down.

Have you ever seen a problem with inflation in a Monopoly game?  This is the system we're talking about here.  Money is generated newly for each player.  There is no other way to generate money, other than being a player who is still participating in the game.
You don't see inflation happening in Monopoly game type systems because the amount of money in the system is fixed at any given time.  Inflation only happens when new money is created whenever someone wants it (which is how corporate banks work, generating new money when someone takes out a loan).  In a UBI situation the money being generated would be a fixed amount that is evenly distributed.
Though ideally there would be demurrage, to avoid people saving it for a long time and then dumping it into the system all at once.  The value would need to decrease over time, so that spending it was better than saving it.  This stimulates participation for those who already have the resources they need without the money.  As long as they spend, they help the whole system be more productive, as everyone gets paid for contributing something of value to the market.

If there is a bank account and some individual, or group, making decisions about how things work (and how to use money) it's centralized.
Bitcoin is partly centralized and partly decentralized.  The rules are centralized (Satoshi made them up, and the core developers and miners are the ones maintaining them now.) but the calculations to keep the ledger going are decentralized.
This is a similar to Facebook, where the content can come from anywhere, but the rules of the game are centralized.
A fully decentralized system has no central control or hub of control.  Control is bottom-up. No one individual or group has control over other individuals or groups, and so the rules are diverse, as is the work being done.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:35:37
You don't "work on" a decentralized network, really.  It just appears.  That's what decentralization is.  It's an emergent process.  So work on some element of talking to other people that works for you, locally, and then find others who are working on other parts, and see how well they connect.

Why would you not want to talk to someone on a different planet than you?  Why not just listen to what they have to say about what their experience is, and compare it to yours?  
I'm describing X and Y as I have experienced them, and trying to help you see what the difference is between them.  My own definitions are based on a lifetime of research and observation of how different systems work.  I don't care if you "believe" me, or if I "believe" you, but I would hope that we could at least understand one another's perspectives of things.  Your planet is indeed very different from mine.
On your planet there don't seem to be consistent definitions for the two different kinds of systems, or even what a system is.  I'm not sure what to do with that.  It's all obviously pretty complex, and more on the side of philosophy and math, but you seem to be really interested and adamant that you've thought this out for a long time.  Which is why I'm frustrated both in trying to help you see what I'm talking about and in understanding how you are looking at things.
You say:


But Bitcoin is exactly like Micros**t in the way it controls things, there is one code that is the official code (at a time).  Sure, the labor is centralized with Micros**t (only those they approve of can contribute code), unlike with Bitcoin, but when it comes to controlling things the folks making the decisions are still the folks making the decisions for everyone, and they tell everyone what is and is not Word, or the OS, for example.  The coders make the code and that's the code.  If a coder makes a new code, it has to be voted on, or whatever, before it's approved, with both Bitcoin and Micros**t.  There is *only one* accepted code (at a time) for both of their systems/software.  
Linux, on the other hand, is totally decentralized, both with labor and the rules.  Almost every individual Linux machine has different code, but it's still Linux.
Now, WHY one set of code is Linux and another isn't, or why biblioklept is English but bibliocreb is not isn't an exact science.  I think that's where you're seeing a big difference between my planet and yours.  In a decentralized system there is no consensus.  In a centralized system there is.  You see English as a centralized system, it seems, while I see it as decentralized.  You imply that there is a consensus about what is and isn't allowed when speaking English.  I see that this isn't the case.  There is a more centralized set of words and usage, of course, but the control of the rules is from bottom-up/outside-in, not the other way around.
Unless you are French.
You say that with Bitcoin:


And that's just entirely not true, and you know it.  We already went over this, and you were clear that Bitcoin Cash is NOT Bitcoin.  Both are a part of a decentralized currency system, obviously.  But the Bitcoin Cash code is NOT part of Bitcoin.


So, you are saying that these nodes can run the code for Bitcoin Cash and still be accepted in the Bitcoin system?  If not, then they are not free to make up any rule they want.


TurilCoin would be centralized too.  All currencies are, by their nature.  For it to be "a" type of currency, it has to have a consistent set of rules (at a given time).  The *system of currencies*, on the other hand, is decentralized, because its a category describing a number of different things (that are related in some way).
At best, you could make CroderCoin in a way that other individuals could modify it, like you drawing a circle on a piece of paper (or a digital image file) with a "1" in the middle, then giving these circles to other people and inviting them to draw and write stuff in the circle, to decorate them.  That would be pretty decentralized.  But it's also right on the edge of what most folks would consider "a" currency.


Yeah, well most humans are very confused about how life works, even moreso in government (I've worked with and in government, so I have first hand experience of this!). :P


That's not being kicked out of the whole system that is currencies, it's one subset of humans agreeing (many through force or ambivalence) on what currencies they will and won't use.  That subset of humans aren't the whole system.  The whole system is made up of everyone who uses any currency at all.

If it is a wallet, then they aren't being clear about that.  Saying it's a wallet, with extra features, would make life so much better for everyone, if it actually is one.

So you think that English was created by a single individual or group who set it all in stone and we can't change it, ever?  (Or have to have some kind of democratic vote with only the words that get some majority vote being "allowed" to be English?)
Obviously that's not true.  All of the words that are English now were made by some random person, and became popular (or not, have you seen dictionaries?!) because others started using them too.  But there is no central controller saying "Yes, this word is allowed, and that word is not."  There is no central government in language, not even the dictionary (seeing as how words tend to go into it well after they are in regular use.
I think it's a lost cause to try to help you understand how these two opposite systems work.  If that didn't help you get it, you're either intentionally acting ignorant, or I'm just not a good person to teach it to you.  Or at least not without visuals.  Maybe that's my next project, to draw some simple diagrams to help people understand these systems.


A solution to what?  My general solution is for us to do what we naturally are inclined to do, which is follow our instincts for doing what we love, find meaningful, find rewarding, and feel is what we were born to do, doing some kind of creating, exploring, and sharing awesome stuff in the universe with the goal of increasing the fitness of future generations.  Anything else seems like a waste of time.  But even wasting time is a part of the learning process, since we gotta make mistakes.  (Also, laying low when there aren't enough resources to do what we really want to do, aka avoidance/depression/meditation, is not a waste of time, though it might superficially seem so.)


Yes, that's my point.  If it were a decentralized system both bitcoin and bitcoin cash approaches to the software/code would be part of the same system, and not be differentiated (on a systemic scale), just like how the different DNA in your body is still part of you, even though it's running totally different code.

I think something with the good parts of this, and not the bad parts, will be the best thing for us.
• We need to be able to choose which content to host.  Not everything we've ever visited.  We don't want to be promoting/sharing stuff that we find harmful or ignorant.
• We want to be able to identify/verify individuals are who they say they are.  So while anonymity is useful, the opposite also needs to be available.  I don't want someone claiming to be Turil, and posting stuff that isn't mine, and having no way for people to check.
• We need some kind of robust and universal categorization system to connect information to similar/related information (in all dimensions).
• Access needs to be entirely non-discriminatory and free.  (No Namecoins!  Random and/or first come first served domain claims.)

You apparently seem to think that the things people buy with money are usually investments, rather than consumables. The point of buying things with credit cards is normally to use those things up. Food, gas, movies, vacations, etc. Most purchases are 100% guaranteed to make you lose your money.
At least with Bitcoin (and lottery tickets), you have a chance at getting more money than you started with.
So, if you think it's a good idea for credit card companies to restrict people's access to their credit, then it should be only allowed for gambling, and not allowed for buying consumables.

Those are all harmful things.

That's literally what it's for.  It "protects" by using threats of violence and physical violence.  It doesn't actually solve problems, it creates them.  A healthy society looks to help those who are suffering/scared not make them suffer and be scared.
And if you think you are free, then it's probably the same psychological situation where captive folks start to love their captors, and believe that they are harming them for their own benefit.  It's a defensive tactic when every other option seems hopeless.

I'm never sure where to go when people don't get what I'm saying when I talk about a system and how the rules are either top-down (centralized) or bottom up (decentralized).
This has nothing to do with one individuals Bitcoin node.  We're talking about the system that is Bitcoin.  We're talking everything that is Bitcoin, from the Satoshi all the way down to anyone who ever owned a wallet (but had nothing in it).  Obviously everyone who's interacted with Bitcoin, even the outside influences like governments and the family and friends of folks who use it, has some small control of the system (no complex system is every 100% pure) but the general control of Bitcoin as a mathematical (number generating and storing) process is controlled top-down, with a central group ("Satoshi" plus some portion of the developers and miners and nodes and users) dictates how things work.
With a decentralized currency (which probably doesn't really exist), how the money/numbers were generated, stored, etc. would be totally free for anyone to make up.  The best example I can think of that really exists is art.  Anyone can make art (physical or digital) and offer it in any way they want to offer it (on paper, canvas, sculpture, books, video, audio, games, performance art, etc.) and the world gets to decide what to do with it, from ignoring it, to destroying it, to enjoying it, to employing it, to trading for it.  It's a system that has totally bottom-up, decentralized control.  No one can tell an artist how to make her art, or what to do with it once it's made.  (Beyond the laws of physics, of course.)  And... I can't tell anyone else what to do with my art once I've made it and put it out there.  Everyone else is free to choose what to do, independent of my own goals and ideals.  At most I can withhold my art until I get a trade (money or whatever) and then trade it if I get one I accept, but only if someone else chooses to do the trade.  It's a fully decentralize system when it comes to control.  It's also decentralized labor, which is what Bitcoin is.

Um... Both systems are centralized, so no.  I can't change the laws within the system and operate independently within those systems.  I would have to leave them.  They are the same.
If I make up my own rules for how I calculate Bitcoin locations and quantities I will be booted out of the game, or otherwise threatened/punished (I might lose my Bitcoin).  Same with a top-down, centralized government.  The punishments are different, obviously, but if I'm not free to make up my own rules, but someone else can and I have to abide by them, then it's centralized.
And did I not already name the most obvious decentralized system of our animal bodies?  Didn't I already talk about how each cell has it's own genome and expression of the genes, and that there are more than 10,000 species that make up human bodies?  All free to make up their own rules, and all independent entities that nonetheless are happily part of the same system.

There is never a need for points in biological systems (which all life is).  That's the biggest con ever, in the history of the universe, I would imagine.
Only humans, and only recently, could ever come up with such an insane religion where we allow others to force us to become indentured servants and give almost all of our resources (including our very lives) to for-profit companies and governments, which, in turn, give us the lowest quality crap and try to make us believe that it's everything we need (while killing us slowly, and making us sociopathic in the process).
The whole competitive approach to life is about as effective as the dinosaurs.  It's simply terrible for everyone, especially everyone not a dinosaur, and isn't sustainable because it's impossible to adapt to wildly diverse and changing situations and environments when things are so centrally controlled and everyone is so dependent on such a delicate and irrational way of distributing resources.
When honestly healthy food, livable homes, fertile land, meaningful media/education, and efficient transportation goes unused simply because someone doesn't have the money to pay for it, we are not only wasting resources, we're wasting lives.
And while it might seem like it's impossible for things to change to a more collaborative, free flowing resource allocation system for humans, we tend to not remember that the future is always very different from the past in usually unpredictable (to most folks) ways.  So while you might not see how things can dramatically change for society, the chaotic/cyclical nature of physics and evolution pretty much guarantees that just like how single celled organisms stopped eating one another and started joining together to become multicellular organisms like us animals, humans will start to do the same thing.
Rather than quantifying our lives, we'll focus on quality, once we choose to stop playing the big old Monopoly game, and start being truly human as we explore, create, and share the most awesome stuff in the universe, for the benefit of ourselves and future generations.

I think a main usefulness of Bitcoin in the grand scheme of evolution of life on (and off) Earth will be to make humans realize the insanity of trying to keep score in some kind of competitive Monopoly game of life.  Both due to the arbitrariness of the rules of creation of those points, and the irrational valuation of things using those points.
When 1 $, £, ¥, ฿, etc. is worth one apple one day, and another day, not long after it's worth 1000 apples, none of it makes any sense.  And when anyone can create a point system, using any rules they want for generating and allocating those points (big for-profits get them first, when they take out loans, or computers keeping track of the database get points, or everyone who is playing the game gets the same amount every time they pass Go, or whatever), is there really any reason to keep playing that kind of competitive game?
Maybe it's time we go play a collaborative game where value is based on real life needs for healthy living for current and future generations.

Trading should be between people you already know.  It shouldn't ever be anonymous, or with someone you only just met online and know nothing about other than some easy to fake paperwork or whatever.
Start a group of Bitcoin folks in your community (online or in meatspace) and build up friendships and connections that way, and do small trades initially.  Aim for ensuring that everyone is happy, with those selling Bitcoin wanting to sell, and those buying wanting to buy, based on each one's current needs.  That way friendships can be maintained and grown the more you trade.
But, ultimately, realize that money collecting is a competitive sport, and that means that this encourages deception and greed and anti-social behavior.  So no matter what you do, at some point you'll probably be inclined to screw even your friends over an they you.

From the linked article:


So, your estimate for holiday lights is way, way, way off.  And that figure is JUST THE USA.
That website you linked to estimates that Bitcoin uses about 70 billion kilowatts (right?) annually, for the whole planet, not just the USA.  And that's for the whole year.
The holiday season is about 2 months, at most.  
So in the same time period, Bitcoin globally uses just a bit more than holiday lights use JUST IN THE USA.  Add in all of the other countries that celebrate stuff in December with pretty lights and such, and it's definitely more than Bitcoin.
You can claim that either one is more important, but in the end, if only Bitcoin has energy efficiency baked into the game, since the cheaper your energy is, the more money you make mining.  And only efficiency reduces costs in the long run.  A lot of mining companies set up shop in places with renewable energy, or use the excess heat generated by the computers as normal heat needed for buildings.  Also, extra heat can be turned into electricity, if you set up a nice little sterling engine.  Which is just nifty.

The problem that I see Bitcoin solving for us is keeping track of resources in a resilient and efficient way, through a network of independent servers/nodes.
The money thing isn't actually important in the long run, it's just a temporary way to gamify things to make some folks more interested in testing and designing the structure and details of the system.
Ultimately we want a global network database that lists all of the publicly available resources that are available to anyone, anywhere, who wants or needs or can recycle them.  We want this database to be as accurate and functional as possible, so the infrastructure needs to not be centralized in nature, and it needs to be organized in a way that uses the least amount of energy.
So right now we're all contributing to helping that infrastructure evolve, as we critique and analyze what's working and what isn't, and tweaking things from there.  We're doing pretty darned well so far, but it's still very much the first few drafts, rather than the finished story.

This is indeed the big problem we're having right now.  We don't have a good, healthy society where individuals are actually connecting with one another in a peer-to-peer way, so they look to centralized authoritarian groups to "protect" them.  
But this is something that Bitcoin can probably help with.  We can set up local, non-profit, community "exchanges" with the people we actually interact with in day to day life.  That way we aren't forced to use the for-profit, private, sketchy exchanges, but still have the option of trading with people we don't personally know and trust.

If you read this you might understand why I'm talking about tax evasion being a major problem for Greece (read the middle bit, after they get past the extreme idea of the 90% tax evasion myth).
And yes, the desire to create and explore and share good things is indeed coded in our genes.  All biological organisms have this, otherwise they'd all go extinct.  If you study psychology and biology you can see how this works with both instincts and neurochemistry's reward system for solving problems.
What you're looking at right now is a planet full of humans who are at the very bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and mentally very sick.  Stress is nearly at a 100% saturation point in humanity, and so you see the fight/flight/freeze response in pretty much everyone.  Those folks who don't have the motivation to do anything but play video games are feeling that way because they don't even have the basic nutrition needs met, let alone the next few levels of needs of freedom of expression (Maslow called this "safety'), love and belongingness, and meaningful work that benefits the world (instead of making it a shittier place, like most monetarily-tied jobs do).

Ok, another decentralized system is language.  No one can force anyone else to use the words, sentence structure, or even definitions that they use.  There are thousands of languages, at least (including computer languages), new words being invented, and changes to definitions happening all the time, and anyone can make up a word or rule about using words and they are free to use those words and rules, even when no one else ever uses them (secret codes, for example, are made up by both kids and adults regularly).  There are attempts to centralize language (I see you over there France!) of course, but those aren't systemic.  They are localized, and tend to fail in the normal world of communication (my French buddy speaks in English most of the day, because she's online most of the time).


Which is, as I've said over and over, being kicked out of the Bitcoin system.  You seem to be ignoring that very obvious fact.  Sure the individual or group who gets kicked out can try to claim the original name, but that's totally aside from the point that the Bitcoin system itself doesn't allow for decentralized control.  There is one and only one set of rules that everyone has to follow, or leave.  In a decentralized system like currency as a whole (which is what you are talking about when you say that someone could split the blockchain/ledger to go a new direction), everyone can make up their own rules.  But Bitcoin itself is centralized, when it comes to governance/control.


Um... I don't know exactly how the details of the code work, but clearly if you decide to make up a number and say "I have this number of Bitcoins" and try to get that entered into the ledger, entirely without a history of where those numbers came from, the software the nodes/miners are running, your claim will be totally rejected.  The same would happen if you decided to write a new version of the code, as Bitcoin Cash folks did.


Of course you do, you get rejected by the system.  If you want to know exactly how the code does this, you're on your own.  I'm no developer.

Does your body ever decide to divide itself?  Do you ever spontaneously split into to humans?  I don't think so.
Again, the key difference is if individuals are free to use their own rules, or if the rules are imposed by others.  All the cells in your body have their own genes and expressions of those genes.  The 10,000 other species's genes, plus the two human sets of genes that make up your body are all independently governing themselves, while collaborating on a shared goal.  The rules are different, but the system is a whole thing.  That's decentralization.
With Bitcoin, and mainstream governments, there is one set of rules that everyone must obey, or be considered a threat to the system, and either forced to obey, or rejected (kicked out, deported, jailed, killed, or whatever).  That's a centralized system.  
The central authority of Bitcoin was initially Satoshi (whomever that was) and now some percentage of the devs, miners, and nodes.  How do you think changes to the rules have happened?  By some kind of majority vote.  If you are in the minority, you either are forced to obey the rules that the others have made, or you are rejected from the system.
What IS decentralized in both democracies and Bitcoin is the labor.  Anyone can contribute to the resources and work that needs to be done in the system.  Anyone can be a miner or developer in Bitcoin.  Anyone can vote (well, most anyone) in elections in the US government.  So the labor is decentralized, but the rules are centralized.

That is religion if you think you have proven something, or know something as a "fact".  
Ages ago, one of the best thinkers of humanity, Rene Descartes came up with a phrase "cogito ergo sum".  Most humans these days don't know what that means.  Which is unfortunate.  But that's due to a bed meme going around that uses manipulation as a tool to try to control humanity to be subservient and robotic, rather than independent and chaotic as nature/life needs us to be (to take good care of ourselves).  That meme that authority figures promote is that they *are* authority figures and have the power to "know things" that you don't, and thus you must follow them or die (or whatever other terrible fate they claim).  It doesn't matter what the "facts" are that they claim to have, and share a little bit of with you (in return for your obedience), it's a religion.
Real science tells you that the *only* thing that I can actually ever know is that "something exists" because there is 100% proof that I am experiencing (cogitating), and for me to be experiencing, I must exist.  Beyond that, I can't ever be sure that *what* I'm experiencing is real.  It could all be an illusion in my head (or whatever is my "I").  My senses can always be deceived.  So no matter how real something feels, I can't know that it's real, only that *something* is being felt/experienced/thought.
But we need at least some story of our lives for us to not go completely mad, so we make up religions and start believing that we "know" things at a more detailed level, such as the idea that we are living on a planet.  It's just easier to make up a potential fiction and claim it's a real fact than to hold doubt, the way scientists do, as we understand that no matter how real it feels, it could just be that we're a computer simulation that is programmed with this story, or that we're in a coma having a dream, or...

That's because logic is about including all the different vectors (goals) in a system.  Logic is about seeing how the different actors in a system are affecting the system itself, so you can see where everything is moving.

It fills the same roles as a currency, as in a numerical score representing a value within a set of individuals.  So, to most of us, Bitcoin is indeed a currency.
It's also a system for keeping track of resources, which is where it's real value to the planet is.  But that's not something that most investors or miners care about.  Because the development of the tracking system has been turned into a competitive game, where the early players can make money (points) off of new players.

You ignored the rest of what I wrote immediately after that.


Most cake is shit.  It's not even food.  It's a drug.  It's the product of competitive approaches to life, taking what was reasonably useful as a food (made out of whole grains, minimally processed sweeteners like honey and maple syrup and dried fruits and such, and usually some minimally processed fats like real, locally made, fresh butter and milk) that was eaten once in a while as a super charged treat, and turning it into a totally empty calorie filler that just dumps highly refined simple carbohydrates into the system.
And no fish in real life would overeat real food.  It's only the crap that is made into processed "fish food" that's like our modern cake.  It's junk.
We have to eat more of the junk to give our bodies even close to what it needs.   But when we eat the real thing, we are easily getting our needs met and don't take what seems, superficially, like too much.
It's still always just right.  It's just that the lower quality stuff requires more to be just right.
We are in a temporary state of abundance of shit now.  Soon, we'll stop doing that and start actually making high quality stuff because we're sick of being sick.

Clearly you are confused.  There are many ways that your edited message would not be seen before someone comments on it.  They could load their messages and then slowly go through them, responding to them as they do.  This could take hours, or days, even, depending on how many message they have in their inbox at the time, and how long their responses take to make.
Or, they could be responding while you are editing.
I mean, if you don't care for someone else to see your comments in full, then just go ahead and edit several minutes, hours, or days later.  But that's not me.  If I have something more to say, rather than just a quick fixing of a problem, I'll do it in a new comment.  That's just the respectful thing to do, since I do want people to see what I've actually said, and not make them look like they were being obtuse or stupid.
As for the protection.  Ask most humans why they pay taxes and work for employers and vote in elections.  They are very likely to say that they do it so that these centralized systems will take care of them in some way, be that through a military, or earning money to pay the rent/mortgage and keeping food on the table, or defending their rights when some group wants to threaten them, or whatever.  It's all an attempt at having someone else do something that will keep them healthy/safe (er).
Certainly some of the threats come from those centralized systems themselves.  Paying the mob to not kill you is still paying them to protect you (from them).  Using a dangerous dinosaur as a body guard is still a form of protection even if doing so means that you could easily be trampled to death.  As long as that danger seems less than some other danger, it's still a better idea.
As I said, it doesn't have to be logical or even what people consciously want.  It's still done because people think that the centralized system will keep them safer than if they didn't feed the dinosaur.
And yes, you can only ever be somewhat safe.  There is no way to be 100% protected.
Even the most effective, collaborative, decentralized, creative, respectful, free, diverse, awesome system will have conflict and sickness and challenges that we won't overcome.  So that's kind of a moot point.

That *is* protection.

That doesn't mean you're not scared.  In fact, that means you are scared.  That's why you want to feel protected in the first place.
Only when you feel like you have a better option for being healthy will you redirect your resources to something other than a centralized, top-down, violence-based government.  At that point you won't be working for $, you won't be paying taxes, you won't be buying things from companies, and so on, and the more humans who do this, the more those things will wither and die, and we'll all be free.

I can say it's us, as in everyone.  We ALL collaboratively create our society.  There is no single individual or even small group that makes things the way they are.  We all have power to change things.  Each individual has some ability to affect the whole.  That's because reality is chaotic and emergent.  Who we choose to give power to (offer our resources to) is who has the power.  We can choose to give our lives to our corporations and governments, in exchange for some sense of being parented (protected and nurtured) plus some Monopoly money to play the rat race game with.  Or we can choose to give our lives to something more evolved, perhaps. Maybe something like this: 
Any time you arbitrarily lump yourself into a group that you define as "not having power", you are actively giving up your ability to wield your actual power (your time, energy, and material resources).  That's a choice you make.  Not anyone else's.
And yes, people is more than just humanity.  People is all the living creatures in existence.  Human society is just a small part of the entirety of evolution of life on Earth. But that's another issue altogether.

Um, not at all.  Where do you think all the words in a language came from?  From the bottom up.  You aren't in the least bit going to get kicked out of speaking the English language by saying "This chili is blooshingly delicious!"  Someone might ask you what "blooshingly" means, but no one is going to force you to stop speaking English because you made up a new word.  And they aren't going to say that you don't have a right to make up a new word, because that's literally how new words come into being (again, with some ridiculous exceptions like in France, where the language is indeed trying to be centralized, and with dictionary publishers, and their cousins, who try to centralize language rules, but don't have any actual power to do enforce those rules).
As for exactly how things are enforced on the boring detailed level of code in Bitcoin and other centralized systems, who cares?  It's irrelevant to the kind of government in general.  System structures are at a high level of generality.  The details of how a government functions is a low level, and they can vary infinitely.  Do you really care to know how a police officer is trained, or how a democratic vote is collected (via paper ballots or electronically), or how a company notifies an employee (email, paper, by the boss personally, etc.)  that they are fired, to know that the system is a centralized system?  No.  Studying those things is pretty silly if what we care about is understanding the overall type of governance that the system has.


Yes, the centralized control of Bitcoin is what you like, it's clear.  You're happy that the labor is decentralized, but you don't want the governance/control to be decentralized.  


Obviously not personally.  But clearly you see that the Bitcoin Cash code is not part of the Bitcoin system, itself.  Otherwise you, yourself, wouldn't go out of your way to say "Bitcoin Cash", to distinguish it from the Bitcoin system.  You've banished those folks using that code from those who use other code that you think of as "Bitcoin".  That's because the Bitcoin system is centralized and doesn't allow diverse rules, and kicks out those who don't obey the centralized, top-down rules.

Um, have you never bought anything with Bitcoin?  We do this all the time.  You pay whatever the price is based on the exchange rate at the time.  Just like you would do if you were buying something from another country.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:24:10
The price is always artificial.  There is never any natural value to a currency.  It's just symbols that some individuals agree have a temporary connection to things that actually do have value.
Understanding the core functionality of a currency will help you see how trivial all of these manipulations are.
The real value of Bitcoin is in it being a network of computers that keep track of a global database of resources (fake ones right now), that will evolve into sort of a global resource tracking system for when we have a free economy.  Once the beta testing that is Bitcoin gets really tested well, and found to be robust and efficient for keeping a global ledger, then it will move into the real deal, where real resources are able to be tracked as they are transported from where they are freely offered to where they are needed/wanted/recyclable.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:46:01
Bitcoin growth is only unsustainable if it reaches the whole human population (who want to play the money game).  Saturation is the end of growth.  We're nowhere near that point.  Bitcoin will likely be killed off by humanity becoming a free species. Once we choose to be like all other species who just do what they love, for free, and take what they need from what their environment freely offers, instead of trying to compete against one another for artificially limited points while rejecting their natural goals and needs, there will be no need for those points to linger as a meme.
But the process of creating a global database (ledger) that's kept up-to-date on all of the locations of our available resources, will be enormously useful, so us waiting for global adoption is what we're doing now, and using the motivation for collecting those artificial points is what's keeping things moving forward, as folks look to make the process more efficient.

So many people are confused about what a decentralized system is.  
I came up with a way to dramatically demonstrate it:
If a system isn't chaotic, then it's centralized.
If one individual or group makes the rules for the whole system, and can impose those rules on everyone else in the system, then it's centralized (control).
It doesn't matter if the central hub of control is made up of 1%, 99%, or .0000000000001%, it's still centralized if the rest of the individuals aren't free to make up their own rules.
As I said, a human body is made up of cells with thousands of different genomes, and each cell has it's own expression of those genomes.  A heart cell can't force a white blood cell to obey the heart cell's genetic programming, for example.  But a developer, who is backed by some large percentage of the miners/nodes can indeed force all of Bitcoin's miners and nodes (and hodlers) to use Bitcoin in whatever way they want.
And you're the one who seems uninterested in what I have to say in my discourse.  Why do you think what I have to say makes you so uncomfortable that you want to insult me and/or run away?

Competition drives desperation and cheating and wasting resources.  Which is why our planet is so fucked up now, including our society and human health.  We've been competing against ourselves, and in the process destroying life and our own well-being.  When you fight against others, you spend inordinate amounts of resources going nowhere (literally the goal of fighting is to stop one another from progressing).
Collaboration to solve shared problems, on the other hand, drives creativity and innovation and effective use of resources.  NASA was successful because it was a non-profit, collaborative, creative effort, not because it was competing against the USSR.  We have done far more as a species since we started collaborating with Russia than we ever did when we were competing against them.

Not to hijack your post, but if you are at all interested in helping out a cool non-profit project start a community space that hosts resident artists, techies, and educators for free in exchange for doing cool community service projects, we could really use a little boost to buy property (ideally a cheap fixer-upper farm, probably in Midcoast Maine).
I've got some funding right now, and I'm actively looking to buy land outright (and then build) or maybe get a mortgage (but I'd like to avoid that).  But more funding would be fantastic and maybe even enable me/us to get a farm or something similar outright, and get things up and running as soon as possible.

A couple quick (ish) things:
.1. There is no disagreement or agreement here, just different perspectives being described.  Remember, we're talking about different planets.  Things work differently based on which planet one is on.  All perspectives of all planets, as long as they are honestly described, are valid and useful.  Two sides of the same coin, as they say.  It's necessary to find all of the different perspectives, rather than "finding people that think about the world in the way you do".  I mean, it's good to hear similar ideas to the ones I already have, but I already have them, so learning means seeking out different ideas than mine.  And learning is my goal.  (And while your perspective is pretty much the same as most everyone else I've seen, so it's not new to me, at least you offered me a chance to clarify my own approach to explaining what I understand.  So thanks!)
.2. My understanding/description of decentralized systems isn't my own.  It's straight from math/physics/philosophy folks who have been working in the field long before I ever got there.  I started reading about complexity theory, fuzzy math, and emergent systems as a twenty-something back in the early 90's and was fascinated.  I've followed the field every since, but only got seriously into working with these ideas in the past 5-10 years.  


Except that we already seemed to both see that currencies in general are decentralized, didn't we?

@_date: 2018-02-10 16:18:41


That's literally how the normal banking game works.  One individual is always the first to see an opportunity.  Sometimes that is a very short period of time that you have the exclusive opportunity, as in the situation where a sale is offered on a website that is open to the public.  But there is always someone who is first to get there.  Then the next person to see it has dibs, and so on down the line.
That's why when iPhones come out to the public there are lines outside the stores.  And it's why for the stock market there are literally brokers who set up their computers as close to the exchange's computers so that they are first in line to trade.  Those first-come-first served markets are how everything runs, even if that opportunity might only last for milliseconds.


That's close to the same for real life.  Sure, it's a bit of a simplification, which is the whole point of making board games, but if you don't pay whatever rent the landlord charges in real life you lose the game because they kick you out.  And the rates the landlords charge in an areas are mostly fixed, because they all want to compete against their fellow landlords and charge just a bit more than the market rate.  So prices keep creeping up.
Sure, you can get lucky and find a landlord who isn't as competitive.  But, as you say, it's pure luck.


Yep.  That's the whole competitive game of money in a nutshell.  


That's what I'm saying.  With a fixed amount there is no inflation.  As long as points are being generated the same way each round of play, then real inflation doesn't happen.  Right now we have inflation in the national banking game because the banks are generating more points at an irregular rate, based on who's taking out loans, not based on any fixed rate.
And ultimately, it not the number of points overall increasing that causes inflation, it's the *ratio of the number of points to the number of individuals playing* that causes inflation.  If you and I have 50% of the points each and we're the only two players in the game, and we increase the rate of points that we get each round, while the value of each point might decrease, the value of the percentage of what we have does not.  So, really when you are looking at value of a currency, you have to look at how much your percentage of the whole is in comparison to the average player.  It doesn't matter what the point numbers are, because it's the ratio to the whole that we care about.  It doesn't matter if I have $50,000,000 or $50, if those represent 50% of the whole.
But, as I said, demurrage is useful for keeping points flowing in the system, so that the game stays interesting for everyone (until we find an even more interesting game that is collaborative and positive sum).

Nature is everything.  Video games are a part of the laws of physics and evolution just like everything else in existence.  They are not biological in nature.  But they are in nature. :P
And yes, obviously some of the things that nature comes up with interact with our health in not so useful ways.  That's a part of the experimentation (random mutation) process.  Those things get tested out, and either accepted (naturally selected to mate with other genes and memes), or rejected (going extinct).
But, again, people always forget how long this process of evolution takes.  It's not a knee jerk reaction.  It's as thorough as possible, so that nothing good is tossed out due to a bad impression.  
The goal is the best, more fittest, most resilient/adaptable system possible.  (Not an individual or species, but a *whole system* of life functioning collectively, from simple proteins all the way out to cats, and compost, and computer programmers.)
The things like stupid computer games, and money, and grades, and democracy (popular vote authoritarian/centralized rule) that are not so healthy for us will go extinct soon enough.  And the bits of them that are useful (the playful, creative, collaborative approach to solving problems that's seen in video games, the detailed record-keeping of resources that money tries to do, the desire to get feedback about how one is doing that we see in grades, and the ideal of seeking consensus when it comes to making decisions about how to take care of ourselves that we see in democracy) can be separated from the bad stuff, and recombined with other good things to make new, much, much more useful things.

I've seen people linking that article many times.  It's overly paranoid and FUDish, and ignoring the reality of what folks are doing with Bitcoin.
If you want to go after something hugely wasteful, go after personal car use.  It's hugely energy inefficient and deadly to humans, as well as the environment.
Or, like I said, Christmas lights/decorations.
And whether or not I'm "wrong" is unknown.  Because life is complex, and the math is never straightforward in these things.

And burdens aren't normally choices.  That's why they are called burdens.  If we had a better option, we'd choose it.  No one wants to have to use a credit card company to borrow money, or even just to spend their money (which is what many people do because they get points and other rewards) online.  But without better options, we end up doing it.  Hence, it's a burden.

@_date: 2018-03-22 12:24:04
I'm not sure what you are trying to say here at all.
My point is that evolution programs us with natural instinctive drives to explore (input the best stuff we can find that meets our needs), create (do some kind of work that improves life, using that stuff that we take in), and share (outputting the excess stuff that we've made), and all of those things are selected for such that they improve life for the whole system, so that future generations are healthier than ours are, so that life can continue to evolve/grow/adapt to ever more diverse environments, and thus expand out into space and time.
But money and the meme of life as a competitive, zero-sum game, where my goal is to take as much as I can from others, get in the way of that instinct.  It's like a virus in a computer, getting in the way of normal processing ability, and making the computer get stuck in loop that offers no progress.

You have made some really weird projections about what you are imagining I think.  They are entirely backwards.
I've clearly said that what you see now is sickness.  
Our natural desires are to improve the fitness of future generations.  That's how evolution works.  Random mutation (experimentation/creativity) and natural selection (sharing the best stuff) is how biology evolves.
If you really think a healthy organism is naturally inclined to malfunction and do stupid shit, then you really had a horrible education.  For which I'm very sorry.  You deserve far better from whatever teachers and schools you attended.
I highly recommend watching the excellent Stanford class (something like 20 lectures I think) on Human Behavioral Biology by Robert Sapolsky.  All the lectures are available on YouTube, starting here:

Not in any real detail.  We can't even predict the weather tomorrow that well.  :-)
Physics is random, and uncertain, as far as the most current understanding of life goes, it's not a steady state, linear thing like Newton thought.  It's complexity and chaos.  There are overall patterns, but we never know how exactly we will get up to the top of the mountain.
But I think that's something that you're not ready to consider, is it?
As for the whole arbitrary and insane Monopoly game (which is centralized, which is the problem), I'm not sure how to explain it to you.  But the gist of it is that a healthy system works like an animal body, a fully decentralized system, where each of our cells naturally has a unique role to play in the overall system, something it naturally loves to do, and is thus given everything it needs to perform that role, for free.  And because evolution has these wonderfully effective processes of random mutation and natural selection, the individuals end up getting more and more collaborative, creative, and effective when it comes to keeping the system healthy and procreative.  We all end up being totally free to be our unique selves, and are valued for that uniqueness.
Right now we con humans into going against their natural instincts, and so almost no one is doing what they want, and they aren't doing it for free, and they aren't getting what they need to do anything well, so the whole system is fucked.
But soon we'll stop doing that, because it's stupid.  And stupid ideas get weeded out by natural selection on a memetic level.
As long as we are all doing what we love, for free, the system will evolve into one that is magnificently effective, efficient, and able to make pretty much whatever we need out of whatever we have.  Because ultimately everything we need is there for us already.  Matter and energy.  We just need some creative thinking to turn the matter and energy we have in front of us into the matter and energy we need inside us. :-)

Blockchain hopefully doesn't need a point scorekeeping game to be useful.  Because the Monopoly game will be going extinct as a way of life, once we realize that collaborative, playful, free playing is the better way to live.
Blockchain, however, will be useful for keeping track of freely available resources, on a global scale.  So if my community has an excess of zucchini, it can enter it into the ledger, and it will be available to anyone who wants to claim that small mountain of zucchini, and only one individual will be able to take them, so that there aren't problems in people trying to pick up something that isn't there.

It's inherently antisocial, and bad for life.  So natural selection is slowly weeding it out.  Banks and money and the competitive game approach to life will be going extinct as a meme, just like the dinosaurs did.

Centralized applies to centralized systems and decentralized applies to decentralized systems.  It's one or the other.  And in mainstream human culture, there are indeed a lot of centralized systems.
Anything where there are rules that one individual or group defines and everyone in the system has to follow, or be punished/banished by the central control.  A decentralized system is one where all individuals are free to make up their own rules, while still being a part of the system.  (For example the human body, with it's 10,000 different species with their own genomes and each individual cell with it's own expression of those genes, all working symbiotically to create a whole living organism.)
As for Open Bazaar, I don't know much of anything about it.  If it's true that you can make your own protocol (rules) for posting offers and making requests on it, then that's great, and indeed would mean that it's decentralized.
Obviously nothing in the real world is perfectly anything, so even in extremely centralized systems there is some freedom for the individuals, sometimes.

The one thing that Star Trek went backwards, rather than forwards, is in the government.  The future is always more diverse and more decentralized than the past.  The human body is trillions of individual cells, all operating with their own rules (genes and expressions of those genes).  We are 10,000 different species.  And no central control.  No global government, at least not in the pop culture idea of top-down/centralized rule.   We are made to be independent when it comes to rules, and interdependent when it comes to problem solving.
Bitcoin is the last gasp of a centralize rule approach to life, where everyone is forced to obey the same laws or face banishment or at least confinement or other punishment.  Bitcoin is the transition between that idea (meme) of competition and aggression as a way of life that we've been experimenting with for millennia, and an evolved future society that has the idea/meme of life as a collaborative adventure with diverse individuals being able to contribute different pieces of the puzzle so that problems can be solved easily, and everyone can be better off.
Bitcoin has the decentralized, DIY, collaborative element in it's functionality, but it's still stuck in the antiquated competitive approach of a zero-sum game where my gain is your loss.  So it's halfway there.  I think blockchain, without the currency concept, is what's going to get us all the way there, as a simple way to keep track of available resources (real things like food and transportation and books and clothes and so on) so that whoever needs them can find and access them as easily and freely as possible.

For it to be unconditional, it needs to be global, so a national currency wouldn't work.
Though we could make a new national currency that has printed money for those who don't have a computer/phone.

Which sort of cancels out the usefulness of the whole game.

It's not a currency, really.  That's my point.
Yes, money is a huge waste, in every way.
But as we phase out the whole competitive point scoring game as a way of life, we're transitioning by using money (Bitcoin and Etherium, and a few other robust, scientifically-designed systems) to create the thing that replaces money (a free society that uses technology to move resources from where they are freely available to where they are needed/wanted efficiently).

People are indeed people, with seemingly different small scale goals, but, since they are people, whether they are animals, vegetables, minerals, or whatever, all have a shared goal of wanting to share their stories and help things get better, overall, for themselves and those they care about.
And I absolutely am doing something about it.  I work on serving life 24/7 (yes, even in my sleep).  And I'm doing it in an actually effective way.  Not wasting my time demonstrating or fighting against anyone, but by finding ways to help us all get what we need to function well, and connect in creative ways so that we can use our diverse skills and interests in the service of ourselves, for once.
But ultimately, you, too are working on it, as you are, like all living things, running the evolution program that is your DNA and environmental memes, always randomly mutating stuff and naturally selecting the stuff that you think is most useful to procreate with (making physical babies, art, technology, and culture).

Moderation in the professional world is a very different thing from the insanity that is seen in most internet groups, not surprisingly. 
If you want to learn how to be a good moderator, I highly suggest listening to the great Robert Krulwich from Radiolab, and the World Science Festival, to see one in action.  The purpose of a moderator is to ask interesting questions that the forum participants might never have thought of on their own, and to dig deeper into subjects than a superficial conversation might enable.

But what one individual does with a currency is irrelevant to it being a currency.  What if I bought some Canadian money when I visited that country once, and I kept it in a little box (as a memento).  Would that mean that Canadian money was no longer currency?  Even if most humans decided to keep their Canadian money in little boxes like me, it would still be a currency, wouldn't it?  (It would to me.)  As long as it can represent value in any way, to any number of individuals, but wasn't inherently valuable in an of itself (like food, or metal, or friends, etc.), then I would call it a currency.

"Secure" is a non-reality.
The very concept violates the laws of physics (entropy).

Editing after the fact means that the person you are responding to is likely to not see your new comments.  So it doesn't make sense to do that, unless you want to troll them. 
If you are giving your resources to something because you think that not doing so will harm you, that's protection.  It might be delusion, and it might not seem logical, and it might feel like a lesser of two evils.  But it's still wanting to be protected from harm.
We haven't chosen to stop feeding the dinosaurs (violent and ineffective and large corporations/governments) because we, as a collective whole of society (including the humans who are politicians, and CEOs, and police officers, and so on), because we believe that feeding them is the best way to stay safe.

That would be the opposite of Unconditiona Basic Income.  That would be a tax.
UBI is about giving everyone who wants it the same amount, for free, every month (or whatever).  It's like the game Monopoly where you get $200 every time you pass Go.
For a crypto, it would be easy, as the currency generation can simply be something like "generate X number of points for every individual playing the game this month, and allot them accordingly".

Nope.  Bitcoin is designed to be centrally controlled, by "Satoshi" and those who presumably agree with him/her/them/whatever about having a currency that is semi-anonymous and separate from any government or company/bank.
The whole point of making the Bitcoin software is to centralize the rules of the game.  
Yes, the computing of the ledger is decentralized, just like how Reddit content is decentralized, but in both Reddit and Bitcoin the rules that govern the whole system are centralized.
If you try to make up your own rules about how to use/generate Bitcoin, you will get booted out of the system.  Same with Reddit.  These are centralized systems when it comes to power and control, which also allow for decentralized content generation.
Also, a decentralized system is always free to become centralized (controlled from the top down) if enough of the individuals who make it up agree for it to be.  The humans who live in the US or China, for example, are inherently decentralized (free to live their lives using their own rules) but they generally agree to let a centralized group make up the rules for them, for the most part, and thus become centralized.
Same goes for Bitcoin.  If enough individuals who are participating in the game agree to make a rule change, then the rules can change.  And then everyone has to abide by those rules, or leave the system.
A truly decentralized system is one where everyone uses their own rules and those rules don't apply to others.

I think you're confused again.  There are no arguments.  Just offerings of ideas and perspectives.  This isn't a contest, this is a conversation. 
I think the problem is that you aren't curious about things, and instead just want to protect your own ideas.  Which is not uncommon.
If you ever do change your mind and want to learn something about how complex systems work, you could do a web search for complexity theory and chaotic systems, and see how a healthy system grows from the bottom up, with behaviors emerging out of what seems like nowhere.  Each small part has an effect, and, as we see in the Lorenz attractor, even the tiniest change can create a huge variation in the state of the system down the line.
It's true, a government/society/system doesn't represent any individual.  It IS all of the individuals, combined.  That's sort of what I've been saying all along.  It takes all of us to create a whole system.  But our individual actions have an effect, like drops in a bucket.

The "pay with PayPal" format is another way of writing pay-with-PayPal, and is used when you're trying to indicate that the whole phrase is essentially a single term (usually an adjective).  Using quotes instead of the hyphens is a style choice, though it's usually used either to avoid using a lot of hyphens, which can make things hard to read, or when writing in places where columns are narrow and the term might be in danger of getting split up with more hyphens.
However, usually the word "like" is included in the adjective amalgamation.  So it probably should have been "Pay with PayPal like" button.  But that just looks awkward.  So maybe they should have gone with "pay with PayPal" style button.
But as long as there is some "like" or "style" in there, it's very clear that it's not literally a PayPal button.

Mostly the developers, with the miners having a strong yay or nay vote.  The users (investors) also, obviously have a vote.  But the code is able to change because of the developers.  So if they want something, or don't want something, they are the ones to make it happen, or not happen.  If the followers support their decisions then things change.  If the supporters don't, then there might be a fork.  Or a war.  Like what happened with Bitcoin Cash.
Basically, the structure of Bitcoin is the same as with something like the US government, where a central group makes the laws, and as long as there isn't some huge backlash, those laws become the standard.
The only real difference is that the developers aren't elected.  They are volunteers who just show up.

And so history does tell us a lot about how the future will be.
Unless another democratic, global, open-source resource tracking system shows up, Bitcoin still needs to grow to at least a 50% human adoption for it to get beyond the beta testing it's currently in, as a way to connect the whole planet with a nervous and circulatory system.

Government is society, and thus it is indeed all of the people.  That's my point.  We all power the government/society.  If we choose different things to do, it will change.  Yes, if only one person changes the effect of the whole system might not seem like much, which is why it will take at least maybe 2% to lead as a tipping point.  Do you want to be one of those leaders?
As for goals, they can be conscious or unconscious.  Most of what we do as animals is unconscious.  Even for us humans.  We still have an effect.  And our genes, selfish as they are, always move us towards more fitness for the system, because genes are what life uses to get what life needs, and life needs to increase fitness of life for life to continue.
And yes, it is a slow and messy process!  Evolution isn't a straight line, it's a wobbly, loopy process just like any learning process.  When we are babies learning to walk, we stumble, and fall, and even when we are proficient at walking we are still in a controlled falling and wobbling (left and then right and forward and backward).
If you embrace that wavelike process of growth, it becomes easier to see, and feel, how things are always getting better for life on Earth (and beyond).

Um... they are purely market driven.  That's all there is.  In the Monopoly game (not to be confused with monopoly as a real concept) all there are are individual players who need to pay for stuff, or want to buy stuff, plus a system for making sure that everyone has enough points to keep playing for as long as possible, before giving up and realizing that it's a boring as hell game. :P
And it is a reasonable small scale model of normal monetary games, except for the part where there is now a banker/government who wants to make a profit off of the monetary system itself.  That's where inflation comes in, since there is no fixed amount of money flowing through the system.  It's variable, and a bank can generate more whenever it wants to by taking out a loan (or giving out loans on loans they've taken out).
As long as the allocation of money is fixed, there can't be inflation.  And so a UBI system where the only way to generate more money than before would be for a new player to come into the game.  And since that new player is going to be needing to buy stuff, they will be spending that money.
What we have now is a system that naturally generates inflation.  That's what we're getting rid of with a Monopoly style game where there is no profit in running a bank.  The bank isn't a player, it's simply an algorithm that makes sure that each individual allotment of money goes to one individual being (human, robot, or whatever else we decide is allowed to be a player in the game).
And, as I said, demurrage should be a part of the game, since real life point scoring games last long enough, and have enough other ways to get resources, for people to hoard the UBI currency and then dump it into the system (like we see with Bitcoin), thus lowering the overall value of each one.  This isn't inflation, as the system eventually corrects itself, but it's got a similar effect in the short term to inflation, yes.  Which is what we want to get rid of.

Yes, which is why the addiction to keeping score with arbitrary quantification systems (currencies, Reddit karma, video game points) makes things worse, as it encourages hoarding/gluttony.  And it turns out that this is bad for everyone, including the individual who is hoarding/gluttonous.  For, hopefully, obvious reasons.
Normally, organisms only want exactly the right amount of resources.  Life is never perfect, and so some resources are of low quality, requiring us to take more than what *seems* necessary, but is, in fact, the correct amount for healthy growth.  
But having humans and others compete against one another for points of some kind also encourages "cheating" through offering low quality stuff that is presented as high quality.  This is the classic "marketing", which is really a con game.  And it's why the more an individual aims to make money, the more sickness the system, as a whole, has.

Up to now there hasn't been a global culture/story, but I see us moving towards that, especially as computers/robots start being a more normal part of our lives, and we see them as equals, along with other biological species.  I think we're starting to amass a whole planet's worth of histories as well as a shared vision of a healthy future, where we use both art and science to find excellent solutions to our problems of getting our needs met.
I imagine that the blockchain will offer at least some way to keep a global record of available resources, as it can track things extremely accurately, and know who has what to offer, so that it can be sent to whomever needs/wants it.  It probably won't be used for everything, but could be used for larger stores of excess materials and products that communities or even households need/want to get rid of.

Life is change.  Those things may have been true in the past.  (Or not.  Since there is no evidence of him having gotten married to anyone other than me.  And also, from what I can tell, they live in different houses.)  But the future is always different in at least some significant ways from the past.  That's what entropy is all about.
Also, in the past, David loved me and chose to spend the rest of his life with me.  That was at least as true as anything you're saying here.  Just because his physical situation changed, and we were both facing homelessness, and needed to find emergency solutions, doesn't mean his emotional, or spiritual reality has changed.  
So, really, anything can happen, within the basic physical reality of humans doing human things, such as interacting with different people, places, and things as we stumble through life in a sort of random walking way. :-)

I asked you what *you* thought gaslighting meant.  We all have different ideas about what words mean.  I've looked it up, and it still doesn't reflect what people these days seem to be talking about when they apply it.  You claim that I wanted you to "trust your betters", except that I specifically said the exact opposite.  I said that that's what you seem to have been conned into doing, when it's clearly harmed you and everyone else, rather than learning to think for yourself, the way I, as someone born in the 1960's did.
There was nothing in what I've been sharing that was at all intended to convince you to believe anything other than what you believe.  I was merely offering you the perspective of other individuals, who are different from you, like showing you that a coin has more than one side.  My attempts are not snide, nor arguments (which are a waste of time in my book, as life is multidimensional, and thus has many different "right" perspectives).  Instead, my offerings here have been compassionate and loving (but not saccharine!) offerings of a possibly novel perspective.  If, by chance, you are not interested in seeing the world through other's eyes, then you won't.  I cannot change that.  You claim that I said "you'll learn" when I very much did not.  I don't necessarily believe you will learn to think for yourself.  I believe that your generation (Gen Y, as I see it) got the needed inoculation of  "authority as quite possibly ignorant or even dangerously manipulative" memes that my generation did, and thus you might not have the requisite brain paths from childhood that allow you to be more objectively critical (both in positive and negative ways) of mainstream top-down ideologies.  If you've never seen corporations, governments, parents, teachers, the media and other "betters" as you put it, be **worse**, then you won't have a reason to even consider looking at them as equals.  Which is what they are.  You and everyone else, even me and the writers of Wikipedia and dictionaries and so on, are equals.  That's the reality that I was able to see as I was growing up.  If you weren't shown that as a young person, then you might never get to see it.  I don't know.


My goal is to let you open up your mind to other realities, so that you become MORE sane, by offering you my own truths, my own perspective, my own honest memories and views.  BOTH of our approaches to grammar are real.  There is no contradiction.  Is that something that you can understand?  I'm doing the opposite of "gaslighting" as defined there.  I'm trying to help you be happier and healthier by sharing high quality information, for you to use, if you want it.
As for you mediocre life now, forced to serve some employer in a job, just to "afford all the expenses" of your life and feeling like people's gifts of new perspectives on life are attacks to defend yourself from, I hope that the upcoming major extinction event of dinosaur memes (rigid, oversized, anti-social, centralized corporations, institutions, governments, and other top-down rule based structures) gives you a chance to free yourself from what seemed comfortable but was actually more like Plato's cave.  As you say, you have already gone through some trauma, and are able to be curious and scientifically interested now, so I think you might have the skills you need to come out of the economic/political upheaval that is to come.

Yes, centralized systems are often under threat of dividing.  That's because they are inflexible.  Which is why decentralized systems are better, because everyone is free to use their own rules, and no one is forced to do things in a way that doesn't work for them.

That's a fallacy that everyone reacts in the exact same way to stress.  We all have different genetic designs, and so we all react in different ways when our environments fail to provide us with the things our bodies (and minds) need to function well.  That's why there is a whole DSM book filled with a whole boatload of different mental illnesses, in addition to the good old physical illnesses that are caused by deficiencies and toxicities.
Addiction is just one category (the "flight") response when it comes to fight/flight/freeze (and flow, the lucky folks who are healthy but labeled as "ADHD" because everyone else is unhealthy, so being actually enthusiastic and energetic and playful is seen as abnormal!).  And, of course, there are other kinds of addiction that are seen as being totally acceptable, like being a workaholic, or sports, or writing dark and moody novels. :-)
Addiction is just one of the symptoms of a self-harming culture where the idea that one has to compete just to eat is the norm.  
When we have an overabundance of resources, but a handful of individuals are allowed to hoard them (also a mental illness) and hold them for ransom, while others have little to no resources, then we know that our goal is not efficiency or health, but "beating everyone else" at a zero-sum game (money, votes, grades, internet points, etc.).
Blame is not helpful here, as that just makes us incapable of solving the problem on our own.  It's another symptom of the competitive game meme, where unless you have some high score (votes, grades, followers, $, £, ¥, etc.) you feel powerless to change things.  But everyone has power.  Power is nothing more than having a good idea and a reasonably effective way of spreading that idea around.
If you put anyone who is an addict into a community environment where they are free to follow their dreams of creating, exploring, and sharing awesome stuff, and get their basic needs (see the bottom of [Maslow's hierarchy]( met fairly consistently, their interest in whatever they are addicted to will disappear for the most part.  I mean, obviously, there will be a need for help physically getting off of the addictive substance, but once that happens, as long as they have healthy inputs and outlets for doing meaningful work (following their dreams), they will happily choose those better things than the temporary highs of the addictive crap.

To some extent, yes, and when you change with your partner, you get better.  You're supposed to improve at doing the things you are passionate about as you do them more.  
I think people mistake lust or temporary convenience for passion when it comes to relationships.  Folks get married to anyone who superficially seems to "be nice", without even really knowing them or having a solid shared purpose in life where each partner acts as a complementary collaborator.
I think the main reason why so many folks do marriage all wrong is that mainstream media promotes marriage as being the goal, rather than explaining what makes a good marriage, and what doesn't.

Blockchain isn't really quite what we need here, but it's a kissing cousin of it.
What we need is to go back to the basics of what the internet was when it first started, a way of connecting different computers together to share information across the planet (and beyond!).  
We need some kind of simple, universal protocol for coding images, text, audio, video, and some kind of cataloging system for relating these things to one another (like the neural pathways in a human brain).  And then we add in various ways to store and transfer that data around the world in a resilient and robust way, so that it's easily accessible and always available to everyone who wants it, when they want it.  And then allow any and all browser "skins" on top of that infrastructure, so that anyone can customize how the information is presented to them.
We need it fully decentralized, so that no one has any more or less access to the information that is publicly offered, and no one can censor, or otherwise control the information.
Blockchain is a little more energy intensive for most of that, since we don't need that much redundancy for most stuff.  The entire system doesn't need to have my cat pictures on file.  It just needs to know that there are cat pictures somewhere, and be able to follow an index to see where they are.

Yes, evolution uses sort of half assed approaches to things until it gets the whole ass right. :-)  Natural selection does require some element of valuation.  And money and votes and followers and grades is indeed a reflection of that.  But it's an arbitrary one, at best, or even downright deceiving at worst.  There is simply no good shortcut to finding a good mate (not just genetically but memetically as well, as we seek to find others to collaborate with on making art, technology, culture, etc.), it's all about taking the time to really get to know potential partners of all sort.  
BUT!!!! There is something that I see Bitcoin, etc., helping us with in this area.  That's the ability to track unique things on the blockchain, and that will help us effectively eliminate wasted resources, as we will have a global database for cataloging available resources (stuff we have but want to get rid of for any reason, from raw materials, to left over stuff, to information and ideas) and for moving them from where they are to where they are useful/needed.  All for free.  It will be like Freecycle.com combined with Amazon.com.  The blockchain allows for really high quality tracking, since things are constantly verified as being where they are claimed to be, and there isn't duplication of records about things.  If, on my property, or on public property, there is a trees-worth of apples that are going to just fall off the tree and rot, because the locals already have more than enough apples, I can enter the tree's location in the database, with some basic information about what it is (using a robust categorization/taxonimical system for really efficiently tagging stuff), and they will immediately be known to everyone across the world as being available.  Some sort of matchmaking software will sit on top of the database and look to see if anyone wants anything similar to apples and alert them while also being aware of transportation/shipping complexities.  (With physical materials, matches go to nearby individuals, but are definitely still available to anyone, based on need and viability of actually shipping stuff intact and undamaged.)
Perhaps the quantification/scoring system of Bitcoin/votes/grades, etc., will be mutated to help the matchmaking software, as we indicate how much we want/need certain things, so that the important stuff can be prioritized.  Like if I have an apple cider press and love making cider, but my apple tree got hit by lightning and died, then I might place a high numerical value to finding apples, so that I can still make cider for my family and friends and community.  Whereas if I simply know of a pack of goats who would love to eat those apples, and I'm happy to pick up the apples and take them to the goats, but it's a bit out of my way, then I might place a low numerical value to wanting apples.
And this goes well with your housing idea.  We can list unused, and underused properties so that people in need of a place to live or stay while visiting, can easily be matched with available options.  All for free.

The credit card option was nearly instantaneous, the bank transfer said it would take up to 5 days.  That's why I use my credit card.

Firstly, let's make sure we're on the same page here as to the difference between money in a bank and money in a wallet.  Money in a bank would be either having a digital record of some point value (a score) in some centralized system, which is either a mainstream bank's database or a cryptocurrency database (with Bitcoin we call that a ledger).  
A wallet, on the other hand, is the where we keep our *access* to those points.  That could be a credit/debit card, checks, cash, or, as in Bitcoin, a set of seed words and/or the private key itself.


In a mainstream corporate bank regulated by a mainstream centralized government there are some protections.  That's a given.  We all know this.  That's a moot point.  I don't know why you keep saying it. 


What you don't seem to understand is that there are more protections for your Bitcoin than mainstream banks because anyone trying to break into Bitcoin's database (the ledger) will be defeated by a whole collection of security agents who look at every transaction ever.  The only way that someone could steal your points from Bitcoin is for them to get your wallet, and yes, that's like someone stealing your physical wallet with your credit cards, checks, cash, etc.  (But that's totally separate from which currency you are using and which kind of bank database you are using.)  With Bitcoin a thief **cannot** steal your points without your private key and/or seed words.  A mainstream bank can be stolen from, and even more importantly, the bank itself can steal from you.  Which simply can't happen with Bitcoin's ledger.  So while there are some regulations that a government tries to impose on your mainstream banks, they are limited, while Bitcoin's regulations are nearly 100%, due to the structure of the database and how changes to it can be made.  (Nothing can be totally perfect, obviously, and Bitcoin developers and others are constantly looking to find problems and solutions, in an open way that the world can see.  If you see a security problem, then please do let the community know about it!)
As for wallets, how secure yours will depends entirely on what sort of wallet you choose.  You can keep access to your points in a very secure way, offline, in a safe, or in some decentralized way where things are distributed in many different locations.  That could be cash, or checks, or cards, or, with bitcoin, you can even store your Bitcoin seed code on paper, plastic, metal, etc. in lots of different locations (redundancy) but use some kind of secondary layer of encoding so that other people won't be able to understand it.  Which would be similar to copying your credit/debit card number and security code, turning them into musical notes, recording a song with those notes, and giving a copy of the recording to friends.  Or, you could keep the access to your points in your pocket.  Your level of security on this side of things is totally up to you.  
What is notable is that if you are talking about a credit/debit card or checks with a mainstream bank, you do have a bit of protection that they might offer you, in case your low level of security allows someone to take your code and get access to your points.  If you report your wallet stolen or lost, they will stop allowing you to access to your points, and then issue you some new code to access it.  And if someone does take/copy your access to your points after you've lost control over it, the bank might refuse to pay for whatever was purchased with your points (screwing the merchant usually), or might give you any money you lost out of their own pocket (I'm not sure how they do that).  At this level, we are looking at things like exchanges where you can store cryptocurrency points and mainstream currency points all together on their database.  There is an option for them to offer insurance and also to be regulated by governments.  You give up some control of your points in exchange, but to some people that's ok.  Others will want to stay away from these places because they mean that control of the level of security is taken away from them.  An offline Bitcoin "wallet" that is stored only as a song given to friends is simply not going to get stolen.  While a password to Coinbase is more likely to be stolen.

The pattern so far is that once we hit an all time high at a bit above a 10x exchange rate (with the US$), we drop to a bit above the previous 10x level for a while, then when we get back to that higher 10x again we level off flatlining for a while, and then blast way up above the next, next 10x.

You don't get people to do things, you ask who wants to help you, and if you have a good idea, people come to help.
Evolution is all about creating individuals who have diverse sets of interests and skills and abilities, so that niche roles get filled.  You can see that in the personality variations in humans, where everyone loves to do something different.  And once you give them the basic needs, and set them free, they naturally do awesome stuff.  That's why they called it the age of enlightenment back then when people like Darwin could just wander around the planet exploring and thinking and publishing fascinating science.  
In the future, that little mini enlightenment will look like child's play compared to the upcoming one, where all humans will be free to do the kind of work they want to do, and thus the quality of resources available to all of us, for free, will expand exponentially.

Yep.  Because they naturally are forced to compromise and con people to make a profit.  
Remember profit requires us to take more than we give in value.
And why would we want to agree?  That would make life useless to have everyone thinking the same way.
For the record, I'm beyond political competitiveness.  I'm an organismist, which is where we have a collaborative system where everyone is free to do what they want, rather than having to compete with one's friends and family and neighbors on the planet to get crappy stuff the way it is now.
Collaborative, free systems are the only systems that have been shown to work exceptionally well over the billions of years of life on Earth.  Evolution knows what it's doing.  It's just very slow and methodical, having to try all possible options (random mutations) before naturally selecting the ones that fit in the best with all the others.  So the dinosaur meme of being as large as possible and taking more than one gives back is going extinct as us more creative, collaborative, playful types, like Musk is in his heart, are ready to take over and create a free, flourishing planet.

Hmmm.  I was asking about the system where the goal is making a profit.  Which clearly is not socialism in any form.
So no.


Clearly you either aren't paying attention, or you have a very low level of self-preservation.


How much less could the planet care?  


I'm not.  I'm talking about basic biology.  An living organism/ecosystem can be healthy or sick.  Whether it is a single cell or a whole planet.
And, really, do you think humans are supernatural or something where they aren't governed by the laws of nature/physics just like all other living things?


I see an actual solution that is not what you think.  One which has already been proven to work over billions of years.  It's called evolution, which always moves towards more collaboration, and needs all resources to be free to flow from where they are produced/offered/overabundant to where they are requested/useful/underabundant  So, I see your statement as being rather unscientific.  The blockages that are caused by aiming for a profit (not being free to express one's excess), which is also called hoarding, make humans not free.  And thus the system becomes broken.  Which it is now.  With us harming one another and all other life on Earth, even when we have good intentions.
This broken system is also why you feel the need to insult my explanations of the science that I've been researching.  The system has broken your mind and heart, and so you reject the best quality memes in favor of the addictive junk that the system has been pushing on you since you were a tiny human.  The meme of competition and violence as the norm is not just unscientific, it's also making you miserable and scared of your true nature and beauty.  Which is sad for so many reasons.

Well, to be fair, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are indeed backed by a central bank (technically it's software code), it's just that it's not a nationally backed central bank.
Yes, Bitcoin is definitely a centralized currency, as the rules for generating it and using it are made by one individual and/or small group of individuals who have the power to change it, while everyone else must obey those rules or be kicked out of the system.
What is decentralized is the keeping of the database records (Bitcoin's "ledger").  Anyone is free to do that.

Your definition of "profit" is very different from the one I've been using and defined already as taking more than you need/want (according to you).  
Fitness of future generations is the goal of all life (the selfish gene wants all its relatives to be as healthy as possible, and that means anything that shares even a small amount of DNA or similar information packaging with it), and when you take more than you need, you get sick.  Too much of even the good stuff will kill you.


It's not a contradiction.  I'm commenting on how defensive you are to the idea that evolution is all about more collaboration and becoming a whole, healthy system, and adding that you also seem to be bothered by me saying that currently we're primitive, compared to where we could be, growth-wise.  
You seem to have been trying to deny all this, for some reason.  Which is sad, since it means you must have been super repressed and lied to about how the world really works, as a way to con you into going against your better interests.

There is no right or wrong here.  It's not a scientifically measurable thing.  It's just interesting names for arbitrary groups of ages.
My point is that the commonly used time periods and names are somewhat illogical, and/or have changed dramatically over the years, to the point where people who when they were growing up knew they were, say, Gen Z, or Gen X, are no longer considered in the group they originally were.
And to add amusement and insanity to things, sometimes (including on Wikipedia) Gen Y is called Millennials.  And those born now are as well.  I think the media just really don't want to give up calling people Millennials, because it's just so hip sounding, compared to the alternatives.
The media really is a fickle and random thing, centered on the idea of drama and attention seeking, so don't take it seriously.  Unless you want to be miserable and annoyed.  But also don't ignore it when it starts creating totally new stories that never existed in history, thus revising history.

Popularity usually means that something is average, at best, because popularity requires that something be the lowest common denominator.
Like the word "the" is the most popular word in English, but it is clearly not a word that anyone is likely to really care about or put much value in, compared to far more interesting and useful words in the "long tail" of popularity.
No one really likes the idea of life as a competitive point scoring game, but it's been the lowest common denominator for a while, and so it's what you see as being the norm.  While in reality most humans would absolutely prefer to live in their own unique way, based more on their own individual passions.  
I see the future as one where every different, interesting, approach to resource creation and sharing gets used, instead of everyone feeling forced to use some boring game approach that no one actually likes very much.

First of all I'm not spending, then my balance can't go down.  
Remember, Bitcoin is non-inflationary, as it's based on a percentage of a fixed amount.  If you have .75 BTC and hodl, your percentage of all the BTC in the world stays the same no matter what else happens.
Owning Bitcoin is more like owning farmland.  The produce that that farm grows every year will vary, but as that land is some percentage of the whole (Earth), and as long as you don't sell or give it away, you will continue to have that same part of the planet to use to grow food.
Now if you want to use your Bitcoin to buy farmland, then maybe that's a good idea.
And, sure, selling BTC when it has a high value compared to other things is good too.  And buying when it's at a low value compared to other things is good as well.  Which is what most people try to do.
But since we don't know about the highs and lows until after they happen, one of the more reasonable approaches is to just keep the land unless you want to do something really useful with it.

Food is already free in many places.  I pointed out some in my comment already.
Do you realize how much food is "thrown away" these days?  Vast amounts.  It's such cheap stuff that it's really only worth selling in bulk.  Grocery stores make almost no profit off of food, but try to get you with other stuff with a higher markup, and with volume sales.  Soon, only expensive food will cost money, and non-profits will probably take over normal food distribution, since it won't be profitable anymore.  Already a large percentage of humans in the western world get food for free or almost nothing at non-profit food pantries and free lunch places.  And, of course, many modern companies give their employees free food, like Google's famous gourmet cafeterias and snacks.

How do you define "gaslighting", out of curiosity.  
It's definitely not something that my generation ever bothered to name, or at least not that I'm aware of.  To me it's a sign that we've taught young people to stop thinking for themselves, and to only ever "trust" some authoritarian leader who tells them what to think.  They start realizing that this is a bad idea, and start blaming everyone else, no matter what they say, if it doesn't agree with what they believe.
My generation, Gen X, grew up watching the Hippies reject authority, so we sort of learned early on to take everything that anyone said with a grain of salt and to think for ourselves.  It made us rejects from mainstream society, but at least we didn't get sucked into the military-industrial complex's brainwashing, for the most part.
But maybe since younger generations, which I'm guessing you are part of (given your behavior here), never saw anyone before them reject society as strongly as the Hippies did, there just wasn't a model to go on, and letting authority and corporations dictate what life is "supposed" to be like seemed comfortable and "safe".  Which, obviously, is a horrible idea.
Reality isn't "supposed to be" anything other than chaotic, random, messy, and unpredictable.  There is no safety.  No security.  No predictability to life, on any detailed scale.  But that might not be something you're ready to consider, given that it's not what you've been taught to believe by the authorities that have pretended to keep you safe and comfortable, while keeping you ignorant.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:20:24


Mostly, yes.  That's pretty obvious, as we literally say that "Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto".  It didn't naturally evolve from diverse individuals in a piecemeal manner, emerging up from disconnected parts.  It started in the center/top (one individual or possible a small group working together) and moved out/down to the rest of the world.  


There can be changes, clearly, but those changes are controlled by the center (some percentage of the group who writes the code and maybe does the mining), not me.  I don't get to decide my own rules for Bitcoin.  If I use different rules for generating the math, I get rejected by the system.
But with English, I can easily make up a new rule/word, and use the words that exist in any way I want, and while I might not be totally understood, as is the case nearly all of the time, even here in our discussion, we are still speaking English, and I'm not going to be kicked out for saying something just because you don't understand it.
I mean if I say


You might not have much of a clue what I'm talking about, beyond something probably diamonds, and maybe teeth gone bad in a mild climate. :P  Or maybe you know exactly what that means.  Regardless it's still English.  And no one is going to kick out the speaker for saying such a sentence that most English speakers can't comprehend.  As long as the speaker understands it, and feels that they are speaking English, then they are a part of the English-speakers system.  There is NOT a vote where a majority has to say it's OK to use a word or sentence!  I can give you a definition of "maser" as "a banana shaped shoe" and you don't need to agree with me at all while still realizing that I'm an English speaker like you.  I could, like Shakespeare did, make up totally new words left and right, and if I tell you what those words mean (to me), or at least give you some good context to figure it out, then I'm not going to get kicked out of the English speaking people group.  People might get frustrated talking to me, but they aren't going to stop me from being "an English speaker".
That's not the case with Bitcoin.  It's a democratic (mob rule, centralized) system, where everyone has to follow the same rules.  If I say "I'm wearing my masers today, even though it's snowing." I'm not going to be told that my definition of "maser" is "wrong" and "unacceptable" and that I can't use it in English.  I might get thought of as weird, but I'm not going to be banned from using the word in the way I want to use it, and people will still be able to understand me as being an English speaker.  There is no one individual or group, not even a majority, that gets to decide that a word or definition or sentence is "not English".  There is no vote.  As long as one person wants to use it, it's usable, and still English.  No one else ever has to agree with me, but it's still part of the system of English.  Of course, since this is a bottom-up/center-out system, the more a word or definition is used, the more it sticks around.  But no matter how many individuals use it, or agree with it, no word/definition/whatever is ever "disallowed" as long as someone, somewhere has used it.
For example the following words may or may not be "English words":
genipap, futhorc, witenagemot, gossypol, chaulmoogra, brummagem, alsike, chersonese, fylfot
But since I've used them here, they are now in existence as being a part of the collection of words that have been uttered by "English speakers".  If they are never used again, they will still be a part of the English language, even if only on the very edges.  And no one else has any power over my using them.
(For the record, those are indeed all in mainstream English dictionaries.)
What I think you're seeing is that the stuff that is closer to the center/top, in a decentralized system, feels more like it's centralized.  Which is sensible.  But you have to look at *where* the power is coming from and how rigid the system is.  Are all individuals equally empowered to make up whatever rules they want?  Or does some individual or part of the group have the control to accept or reject those rules?

I'm with you on the other stuff.  But while Bitcoin is indeed exponential, it's also anti-social in it's nature (it's a competitive, win-lose/zero-sum game) which is a meme that is going to go extinct, rather dramatically, in the very near future (5-10 years is my guess) just like the other other dangerous giants that evolution has experimented with, the dinosaurs.
Because evolution isn't linear, or exponential, it's loopy.  Things spin around in our universe, while also moving foward (more entropy/evolution).

Hormones are just one of the things that some cells do, as they follow their own rules for doing what they want to do.  Everything in a system obviously influences everything else, otherwise it's not a system.  A neuron in the prefrontal cortex releases serotonin when it is triggered (by other neurons, due to sensory input combined with memories, usually) because that's what it's rules say it will do.  And the neurons on the other side that take in the serotonin react to the hormone by doing something else, that they are programmed to do.


The "laws of physics" in a system (decentralized or centralized) aren't governed by any individual or group, they are simply a part of where and how that system exists.  They are *not* variables.  For Bitcoin, and other cybercurrencies the "laws of physics" are the basic functions of computers, math, the internet, and the regular old laws of physics that apply to everything in our universe.  No one can change them.
Yes, there is obviously some code that won't be compatible with Bitcoin.  But in a decentralized system that's not something that can be decided, or voted on.
Again, remember that nothing is perfectly 100% anything.  So there will be some centralization in a "fully decentralized" system, and vice versa.  We're not talking about black or white things here, but fuzzy systems and what their primary functionality is.  Are individuals using their own, diverse, rules, and the system's behavior is emerging from the bottom-up (outside in)?  Or is there some central control, within the larger whole, that dictates what rules everyone has to obey?
(Let's leave out the language example now, since we clearly see things very differently on that, and you seem to think it's centralized, while I see it as being free and changing and emergent.  And since we already have one system where we see different things, it seems silly to bring in yet another complication. :-)
In a decentralized system you can't be kicked out.  Period.  (And no one can claim that you "kicked yourself out".)  Because no matter what you do, you are a part of the system if you think you are (essentially).  If I make up a currency, like my Honey Money coins I made, then they are a part of the currency system (where quantities/numbers of things are used to symbolize some actually valuable thing, to be traded for valuable things, or other currencies).  I cannot be kicked out of the currency system because someone else doesn't like the coins I made.  I don't have to obey any rules that someone else made about currencies.  The only rules I do have to obey about currencies are the non-variable ones that define what a currency is.  But, other than being confused about the definition of the word, I'm going to know if what I'm doing is making a currency or not, so if I say it's a currency, it is a currency, even if no one else uses it or believes me.  That's what a decentralized system looks like, with no universal rules/boundaries other than the basic structural reality that the system exists in.  
A bacteria that gets into my body that wants to be a part of the system won't get kicked out as long as it wants to be part of the system.  It can obey any rules it wants (has).  
Now, as I said, there are exceptions to all systems.  Sometimes our own body's cells have rules that make them do things that aren't healthy for the system.  Like with allergies.  That's a part of the evolutionary process, where random mutations can make weird things happen.  Sometimes those weird things are super helpful (eyes!), sometimes they are just partly helpful (hair), and sometimes they are just really not helpful (cancer).  So sometimes some individuals in a decentralized system do attack other individuals in the system.  But not just because they are operating under different rules.  But because the attacking individuals are programmed to do so.  If this internal conflict doesn't get resolved in a way that helps the whole system flourish, then the system will die.  So the individuals do what they can to sort things out.  Not consciously, necessarily, but using whatever rules they have been given.  A system that randomly has individuals who fit together really well will succeed well.
In a centralized system, some controlling force tries to make the individuals fit together well by making everyone obey the same basic rules.  This can work for limited purposes.  But for complex, changing, situations, they are too rigid, and that's why decentralized systems, where there is no top-down control, and freedom of rules, are how evolution does things usually.  It's a free for all trial and error sort of thing, rather than obedience.

It's so bizarre that folks don't understand examples when having a conversation...
My point is that some stuff is cheaper, like computers and cheap plastic crap from China, but on the whole, life's necessities like housing and food and such, are far more expensive than they used to be.  So that inflation rate is likely not accurate for the things we actually need.

Bitcoin absolutely has a central authority, it's just that once Satoshi removed him/her/them self from the limelight, it's not so obvious who's in charge, and a smaller team of developers, miners, and node runners are there, lurking, running the Great and Powerful Oz.
Bitcoin, like all currencies, is an illusion.  A masterful one, where arbitrary scores are treated as if they were Godlike, with promises that always come with gambling, the potential of great fortune.
Whether you believe money is illegal or immoral is subjective.
But we do know that money is the root of all evil, in many people's eyes.  So there's that.

You apparently seem to think that the things people buy with money are usually investments, rather than consumables.  The point of buying things with credit cards is normally to use those things up.  Food, gas, movies, vacations, etc.  Most purchases are 100% guaranteed to make you lose your money.
At least with Bitcoin (and lottery tickets), you have a chance at getting more money than you started with.
So, if you think it's a good idea for credit card companies to restrict people's access to their credit, then it should be only allowed for gambling, and not allowed for buying consumables.

"The people" means all of us.  If you say "some people" that's different.
The people are the things that make government (society).  We are the ones who choose how to allocate our resources, and the collective movement of those resources defines how the system is structured.  If we give our resources to central entities, like nations/states or companies, en mass, then those central entities will have most of the resources (power).  If we choose to give our resources to our friends and neighbors and other random individuals and groups who seem to be able to use them to do good things, then the system will become decentralized, collaborative, and quite different from what we have now.  And we don't even need to care about others for this to work, since it also improves our own individual lives, as it means that there are more resources equally distributed throughout the system, rather than being hoarded in some central location.
Centralized systems hurt everyone.  Which is why we humans are moving away from them.  The selfish gene and the selfish meme might evolve slowly, but they do evolve, and natural selection eventually weeds out the anti-life strategies.

They are vulnerable no matter what.  That's just the reality of trying to keep secrets.
The whole idea of trying to contain information for any real length of time is anti-reality.  But if we are trying to do that, we have to look at our own specific environment/situation to see what is the most effective containment system.  For me, a physical device that is regularly sitting around in public is the least effective container.  While some normally unseen website, not obvious address, and and a password, and multi-factor authorization, to get into it, is the most, unless you literally take out the middleman problem and let me directly interact with the blockchain from any computer at all, using a "paper wallet" (my key and address).

It is the line of exponential growth, based on all of the data.  It's clearly not at all random.  


Not if were growing exponentially.  That's the whole point.  If you're thinking of linear growth, then yes, but life doesn't work that way.  Nothing really interesting is linear in this way.


If you look at the logarithmic chart you see that it was only maybe about 6% below the line, which is well within the normal short term variation of a fluctuating value as it grows a certain rate *on average*.
It's like looking at a 10 year old human who's 4 feet tall, and thinking that they are never going to get to 6 feet, because they are only growing a few fractions of an inch over the course of a month.

So you think God runs reality?
And the laws of physics (which run reality as far as scientists can tell) are what make everything in reality happen.  So real economics (rather than what the people who call themselves economists think is economics) is obviously governed by entropy as well.  
Which is why no one can predict what will happen, other than very general things, and only overall (on average).  And even then most economists get it wrong, because they are still stuck in the steady state theory, rather than quantum physics, with it's randomness and chaos.

We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist... The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”

Bitcoin isn't for microtransactions. Or even small items that really should just be free.
It's for more substantial purchases and trades.
In the near future those will be the only things we use money for. The little stuff will be increasingly free, because it's a waste of time keeping track of all the cheap stuff. We already get tons of stuff for free, offered by folks doing bigger things, and that will continue. Food will likely be free if it's simple stuff, and only the fancy stuff will cost money. Like how you get free bread rolls and water with dinner at restaurants, and free coffee at the office or bank.

Real estate is artificially over valued.
In a natural, free society we can all have our own homes, farms, art galleries, libraries, parking lots, or whatever else we want, because there is plenty of building materials and technology for using them and desire for having them.
We just need to stop repressing ourselves (building laws, "respecting" land ownership even when land is abandoned/unused, mortgages/debt as the norm, etc.) in the name of someone somewhere thinking they have a right to making a profit.

When it goes up 1000-10000 times (or more) it definitely adds up.  Especially since we're talking about a percentage of an individuals own monetary wealth.

I'm not u/playrest but I am homeless (with some bitcoin investment) and most of the time I stay in shelters, but there aren't enough beds to go around, so when I don't get in, I either stay awake all night, or I camp, or maybe find a friend, or do couchsurfing.org (like AirBNB but free).  Other people actually just sleep outside or in weird spaces.  For years I lived in a semi-abandoned building, with no heat or water or electricity except my 80 watt solar panel.

No.  That's not how it works.  The courts just have to have a jury (or judge) that believes, beyond reasonable doubt, that the defendant did something.  You pretty much never "prove" anything, since even science can't do that.  Even those who were there and witnessed something often are confused or misremember.
Which is part of the reason that the court system is so messed up.
The other part is, of course, that we are all capable of harming others when we aren't getting our basic needs met for mental and physical health.  So harming people who harm people who've been harmed by people is just exacerbating the problem.
But that's a much bigger problem.

Communism is the opposite of consensus.  Consensus is monoculture.  Communism is diversity/chaos/freedom/nature.
This isn't utopia.  It's just normal, healthy systems, as we see in living organisms.  It's just that entropy moves evolution slowly, from the simple stuff to the complex stuff.  Cells and bodies are simple compared to bodies and planets.  So it's taking a while for the planetary system to fully form.
And, as I already said a few times, you can't just have a community that is fully free and decentralized.  It's nonsensical.  So no, neither I  nor you can just start our own.  It's an emergent property of a whole system, and in this case we're talking about a planet.  Which means all Earthlings have to be free, not just the non-humans (or most of them, aside from some non-free pets and zoo animals and lab rats), which is the case now.

And "longing" is not buying Bitcoin, if we're comparing it to shorting, which is betting on what Bitcoin will do, not actually investing in Bitcoin itself.  My joking question was if you can bet on Bitcoin going up as well as down.

Patterns in the universe aren't ever identical on the detailed level.  We're talking very general changes.  Each of those colored boxes is a single change (blue and brown boxes) or non-change (pink and mustard) in the pattern.

Have you ever heard of folks with social anxiety talk about having enough spoons to do something?  They use the term spoons to refer to emotional energy.  But in this case spoons are totally decentralized, rather than the faux decentralization of Bitcoin (where a small group of people control it and make up the rules).  So starting your own spoon currency would be useful if it was useful to you, and only you.  You couldn't give others your spoons...

No.  The biggest problem is that it's almost impossible to actually buy Bitcoin.

Satoshi's purpose, it seems, was to make Bitcoin more valuable than national currencies.  Sure, he or she or they probably care very little about the specific trading value at any point, but the overall goal was to give the world something less controlled by individual national governments, and more controlled by geeks all over the planet.  Which is what this graph is depicting: adoption, and replacing national currencies.

It's a whole field of research.  But I'll give you a small taste:
Firstly, generally, we know even from (highly faulty in the real world, but accurate for simple mathematical, zero-sum games) game theory experiments of [iterated prisoner's dilemma]( that collaborative/cooperative strategies (called tit-for-tat-with-forgiveness) are the long term winners.  And that's mostly cooperative, only using a competitive approach when the other individual competes (which results in both losing points).   Adding to that, as long as there are multiple players (not just two):


Ultimately, the reason why collaborative tactics work in the real world (which is a creative, positive sum game) is because we need to procreate in order to continue to "live" into future generations (whether we are genes, or memes, or any other form of information packaging).  Procreation requires not only a healthy willing partner, but also a healthy environment/community for one's offspring to grow up in.  So the most competitive individuals get weeded out as being unfit, as they literally can't fit well with their environment (destroying the environment that their mates and offspring need).
Here's a real world example of this on genetic level:

The pattern so far, and then a prediction based on it:
Hit a power of 10 (going a bit above it), for a new peak, then drop to somewhere above the previous power of 10, then hit the higher power of 10 for the second time, and then peak pretty quickly to the *next* power of 10 for a new all time high.
So, we had 
First ATH: above $10  
New low: $3
Second ATH: above $100  
New low: $25
Third ATH: above $1000   
New low: $400
Fourth ATH: above $10,000  
New Low: $3000
Next will likely be:
Fifth ATH: above $100,000  
New low: $30,000
Sixth ATH: above $1,000,000  
New low: $300,000

I like you.
Though, technically, I would say that the cleanest economic model known to women would eliminate money altogether, and have resources flowing freely, from free individuals who are supported in doing what they love (creating and exploring awesome stuff that improves life in some way) and sharing their excess outputs freely, so that everyone gets what they need to be healthy and happy and productive.
But the Bitcoin thing is cool too. :-)
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:41:59
My own approach to making it tolerable for a while longer is to reset everyone's money after some time period.  You'd keep your properties, but your money would expire.
This is also known as demurrage in mainstream monetary circles.
But, really, the whole life as a competitive point scoring game is just no fun in the long run, at least not compared to being free to do what you love, and being free to take what you need from what is offered, like the way a healthy ecosystem works.

Any interaction with a for-profit corporation is a gamble.  Their goal is not to be nice or fair, but to make money.

We never know when the waves will break, but we can at least see how they crest and fall over time, and what direction they are generally heading in.

If there wasn't, then there wouldn't be Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a shared code for generating and allocating number values, and the ledger must be agreed upon, or transactions don't get accepted.
This centralized governance is what gives Bitcoin it's strength and reliability.  For it to be changed, there must be consensus.  Centralized control is great for predictability.  If anyone could generate and allocate Bitcoin any way they wanted, then it wouldn't exist as a thing.  (This is what happens with forks.  They are no longer Bitcoin.)


If people want to use Bitcoin they are forced to follow the Bitcoin rules.  (Those centralized rules are decided by a sort of meritocracy, democracy, and investment power.  But that's irrelevant to this discussion.)
Life, on the other hand, is not centralized, so we're all free to make up our own currencies, or whatever else we want to make up.

Can you point me towards any actually communist (freedom to do what you want, with no shared rules, and resources are free for all to use) systems around?
I'm curious how you define "agorist" and "anarchist". 
And I'm not sure what you are thinking about with your comment involving the cells that make up our bodies.
It's obvious that not all systems can scale up.  But the only system that has ever been shown to last in the universe is the decentralized/free/natural/communist one that our bodies use.  So if anything will work on the next scale up, it's probably going to be that evolutionarily tried and tested one.
Consciousness is, in my view, the complexity of a system's information sharing network.  So the more communism a system has, the more conscious it will be.  Cells are minimally conscious, but connect them up into a whole body, and they are animal-level conscious.  Connect the animals together, informationally, and they are planetary level conscious.  This is what's slowly happening, as we animals are starting to share our stories globally, so that all of us Earthlings can get the information we need, even if it's coming from across the planet.

It's not about a specific comparison, but an overall trend.  It peaked, and then dropped, bumped up a bit, and now is declining again, and staying below where it started ($500).  Looking at the all time graph, it's been pretty stable most of the time, and gone down a bit.

The pattern so far is that once we hit an all time high at a bit above a 10x exchange rate (with the US$), we drop to a bit above the previous 10x level for a while, then when we get back to that higher 10x again we level off flatlining for a while, and then blast way up above the next, next 10x. Sometimes there is a little bloop down right before the mooning event.
This looks like one of those bloops.

That's a given.
Your body grows exponentially, until it slows down and then stops.
You can't totally predict when those things will happen, but in general you can make some predictions that are reasonable.  
Bitcoin isn't in mainstream adoption at this point, but it's heading there.  If it makes it, just like US$, it will be hugely popular, and then steady out, and eventually die off.  We can't tell the timing, but we can make some educated guesses based on systems growth patterns.

This movie is one of my all time favorite things to suggest people watch to understand my vision of the future.  Not the weird monoculture designs of a centralized city, but the idea of focusing our social ideals on helping all humans heal and be healthy, using Maslow's hierarchy of needs as a very beginning guide, so that we can all get what we need to be our best possible selves, instead of always being broken, sick, miserable, and harmful to one another and ourselves, the way we are now.

Science is about making predictions based on theories.  This is science.  There are no assumptions, just educated guesses that are always expected to be lacking in some way, but aiming to be better than the other predictions.
This isn't my graph (which I thought was obvious from my link and everyone's discussion of the "dick line" as in McAfee's prediction), but it is a logical one, based on normal patterns of growth, as seen in all kinds of systems.
There is never any guarantee in life.  But if you pay attention to the data, and do good science, you can get a reasonable chance at understanding how things work, in general.

Blockchains will likely be part of the centralized infrastructures for a decentralized government.
Bitcoin is probably the beta testing for making a global resource tracking database efficient and effective, so that when individuals and communities have needs for inputting and outputting resources on a larger scale than just giving and taking things from their nearby neighbors, they will be able to.
It won't be a government, but a tool for our decentralized "government" to use to take care of itself.

In my experience "centralization" can mean most anything.
Bitcoin isn't centralized in the governmental, systems theory, sense, as it has a central set of rules that everyone has to follow (regarding generation and allocation), just like US$ does.  
But folks like to describe things that have lots of different participants as "decentralized" sometimes, as opposed to something like, say, someone's home, or a bicycle being driven by a single individual.

You are always changing things.  Everything you so affects others.  It may seem like small changes to you, but those changes add up.
As for why people like you continue to give power to the government, even while disliking it, it's because you think that the alternative will be worse.  You feel more protected and nurtured by the centralized government and corporations that you give your resources to (though employment, taxes, voting, buying stuff, etc.) than you imagine you would feel if you stopped giving them your resources.

That's what the psychopathic memes want you to believe.
They don't want you to trust yourself for making your own choices in life, finding your own path towards your dreams of creating and exploring the best stuff in the universe, in the service of life, as you were made to do, by evolution.  They taught you to fear yourself, and in so doing, to fear life, and it's natural chaos, diversity, and creativity, as well.
But life isn't stupid, and the least life-supporting genes and memes eventually go extinct.  So that what is seen as "utopia" (literally "no place") can actually become the boring old, annoying, norm.
Star Trek's society wasn't utopia.  It was just a normal, healthy, system, unburdened by dinosaur beliefs of needing to be controlled by others.  They even still managed to create authoritarian systems, in the form of the Federation.  But the overall system was one of freedom.  You didn't have to join the Federation if you didn't want to.  And you'd still be free to give and receive what you needed, as much as possible, for your own health and well-being.
This is where human society is heading.  Envisioned by a few of us future-thinking types, and then slowly turned into reality by more mainstream choices, based on those visions.  Turning science fiction into science reality.
Because, ultimately, the only truly "fair" system is one where everyone is free to do what they love, and is able to get what they need to do it well, for free, with no centralized/biased rules clogging up the free flow of resources from where they are overabundant to where they are useful/needed.
Which is where Bitcoin comes in.  It's unbiased except for authenticity of it's own accounting.  If I have apples piling up under a tree in my yard that I'd be happy to see someone else use, as I won't use them all, then I can post those apples as being offered, and the system will not only keep track of where they are, but also, somehow, alert anyone who actually needs/wants apples in the area, to come and get them, for free, so that they don't go to waste.
"Privacy" is controlled simply by not telling the system that you want to give or receive something.  Otherwise, you *want* the world to know what you want to get rid of or get.  So "privacy" becomes nothing more complex than deciding what you don't want to give away, or what you don't want to get, and not offering or asking for those things.

Yeah, I'm a scientist.  If someone preaches a truth/proof to you, they aren't a scientist.
It's cool, though, if you aren't a scientist, and just want to let others tell you what to believe about reality.  Religion is important too, as religion is what motivates you to do whatever you do for your community, finding ways to pick answers that serve you and your friends and family well.

It can't.  A currency has to be centralized around a shared agreement about the generation and allocation of the currency.  How they come to that agreement is up to them, either democratically voting, or delegating decision-making to someone else, or some messy combination of both (which is how both Bitcoin and US$ work, with a mess of different levels of decision-making happening).
The terms that are more appropriate to use with Bitcoin vs. US$ and similar national currencies might be *open source*, and *open governance* or *public governance*, as opposed to governance that is private or closed to the general public.  Bitcoin is also global, of course.  Both US$ and Bitcoin are democratic/meritocratic when it comes to who gets to write/rewrite the rules, but decisions about the rules and who gets to make them happen more naturally and openly with Bitcoin, as opposed to more arbitrarily and artificially with US$ (with it's who-you-know and who-you-owe type politics being added to the mix).  This is probably where Bitcoin has the most decentralization, with the way folks find themselves participating in Bitcoin's rule-making being much more chaotic, with people interacting on Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, board rooms, classrooms, podcasts, videos, at meet-ups, and so on.  This is compared to a more centralized, organized approach with the US President, Congress, and Judicial system interacting with the FED and largest banks (and foreign currency systems as well).  We could say that this is just part of how Bitcoin's central governance is more evenly distributed across the planet.  We can't point to just a handful of physical offices or buildings that the central decision-makers congregate.


Which is why I invest a fair amount of my time trying to explain systems theory and how mathematical/rational systems are described.  I do this mostly because current ideology and politics isn't aware of how emergence/chaos can create a far more robust and efficient system via decentralized power. 
I see Bitcoin as a tipping point where decentralized systems do become popular, as we decentralize resource tracking, choosing to use many diverse systems to quantify and map where our resources are and where they are moving.  Not so much as money, but as real resources (like apples, cameras, books, and even electricity, perhaps).  I imagine that each personal computing device, each home, and each community will have its own slightly, or highly, different way to keep track of the resources that the body/home/community both wants to get rid of, and wants to get, and the device will use that data to connect to other nodes as it communicates the body/home/community's input and output needs to everyone else, for an efficient flow of resources.
@_date: 2018-07-20 19:31:36
Yes, and?  What is the better option?
For me, specifically.
There is no way to interact with the blockchain for Bitcoin without going through some middleman process where I'm inputting my private key.  It's just not possible.  
Some folks like to call Bitcoin decentralized, but for the most part it's not.  It's just privatized with semi-anonymous folks running it.  I can't just go up to my buddy and give them some Bitcoin.  I have to ask for permission to do so from some centralized group, somewhere.  So I'm going to have to deal with the complexity of that, and I don't see any better option than blockchain.info at this point.  Putting my private key on my computer, or phone, or other device made by some company that doesn't have my best interests at heart is just as bad as giving it to a website company, but at least with the website I can access my Bitcoin account from any device with internet, which is good when you don't have a home.

We grow and make food for free for others all the time because we're social animals.  And, as I said, it's only in bulk that food becomes worth selling, and the non-profits will likely do that.  They will be funded by anyone who has plenty of excess money, using the donation to elevate their status, or get tax cuts, or something, so, again, money transactions will likely only be for large amounts.

There is no such thing as greed when you can get all that you need for free.
I know it goes against the brainwashing that corporations and their governments drove into us as kids, but, honestly, when you are free to do what you love, you do it, and because evolution is brilliant, it makes us all different and specialized, including some of us being naturally excited about creating technology that helps us do the stuff that we don't want to do, but needs to be done.  As well as people like me who love growing food, and making up awesome, super healthy, delicious recipes to give everyone we possibly can.

I don't do drugs.  I do, however, do science.
Evolution is a process of increasing complexity through collaboration of diverse individuals.  Slowly but surely the most competitive behaviors get weeded out (no pun intended!) through natural selection.  We did this with genes when single celled organisms started to come together to form multicellular organisms with shared goals, and now we're doing it with memes, where competitive multicellular organisms start coming together to form communities and organizations with shared goals.
There's no reason to keep score if your game is a collaborative one.  The score is obvious to everyone.  We just measure things by whether or not they are healthy and able to do cool stuff like they want to do.

My future is one where humans are no longer so competitive that they demand bribery to do what they love, in the service of life.

Big cities have tons of free food options all the time.

Decentralized systems are a specific thing, mathematically.  It's not at all "disingenuous" to clarify what it means.
A central authority can be democratic, or totalitarian, or even random, as long as there is a single set of rules that everyone has to follow in the system.  
And in the case of Bitcoin, the central rules are governed by a handful of humans, with Satoshi being at the core, and the developers and miners and node runners, and those who are involved in other ways, to some extent.
This is similar to national currencies which have a central group who make decisions about how the money is generated and allocated, usually in the government and/or some other organization (the FED and the banks in the case of US$).  
Bitcoin and other currencies can and do change at the will of those governing them.
The main difference with Bitcoin is that it's global and more of a meritocracy than most currencies, with anyone who has the skill and tools to join the developers and miners and node runners, rather than needing to be elected or hired by someone else.
And yes, the main concept of a centralized system is the rules themselves, which must be shared.  If everyone has their own rules, but is still fully in the system, then it's decentralized.  HOW those rules are generated is the form of governance.  (Democratic, totalitarian, arbitrary, etc.)


That's an odd question.  HTTP is part of the rules of the internet, but it's only the addressing system, right?  So it governs the addresses, yes.  But not the whole web, I guess.   Certainly the web is centralized, though, as to get onto it you have to follow certain rules.  I can't just make up a website of my own and have it be on the internet without going through a specific process to make it accessible.
MP3 is a file format, or style of packaging of information, not a system.  The music industry itself is decentralized, though, for sure.  There are no central rules governing music.  I can whistle, or sing, or play drums, or record birds, or anything else, and it's still music, and no set of rules can stop me from doing it.
And the ledger is everything to Bitcoin.  If you "throw it away" you're removing yourself from the centralized system, and aren't engaging in Bitcoin anymore.  I'm not sure why that feels important to you.
@_date: 2019-09-07 23:45:08

@_date: 2019-09-06 17:50:10
Bitcoin is democratic (ish) and distributed, but not decentralized.
A currency can't be decentralized, because decentralized means chaotic, random, and with no stable/shared rules.  Bitcoin is beloved by folks because it IS stable and has very specific rules that keep the ledger super secure.
A decentralized system would be more like art, where anyone can do anything they want, and there is no shard/stable way to do it.
@_date: 2019-09-30 16:02:59
Bitcoin is really better said to be distributed, with each different miner being allowed to enter the "contest" for getting paid for the transaction processing work.
Bitcoin's governance is centralized and sort of democratic, meritocratic, and plutocratic to some extent.  The rules are voted on by the miners and node runners and devs, and these are made up of anyone who wants to participate, has the knowledge of how to do so, and can afford to have the equipment to do it.
Currencies as a whole, with everyone having different rules, and the system being sort of chaotic/complex, is more of what we traditionally call "decentralized" where it's basically a free-for-all, and not at all predictable (when it comes to what rules are used).

Yes, I'm paying for my purchases.  With my money.  Yes, it's time delayed.
But the credit card companies are not paying for the things I'm buying, so it's not their money.  Unless I choose to not pay for the things.
Also, you realize that it's not the credit card company's money that pays for things that aren't paid for by their customers?  It's the other customers who pay, with their money, through interest rates and fees.  The credit card company makes money off of everything.  They never spend that money that they make.  It goes into the pockets of investors and the employees, and maybe, if we're lucky, taxes.

Bitcoin isn't for microtransactions. Or even small items that really should just be free.
It's for more substantial purchases and trades.
In the near future those will be the only things we use money for. The little stuff will be increasingly free, because it's a waste of time keeping track of all the cheap stuff. We already get tons of stuff for free, offered by folks doing bigger things, and that will continue. Food will likely be free if it's simple stuff, and only the fancy stuff will cost money. Like how you get free bread rolls and water with dinner at restaurants, and free coffee at the office or bank.
And no good wallet forces you to use any particular fee.  You get to set the rates yourself.  Do some research and figure out what's right for your particular transaction.

It's not even fully developed then.  That's just when it starts to work at all, really.
Age 40 is when it fully comes on line, when the two sides start to operate in tandem, instead of having to operate one at a time.

Communism isn't socialism.  And, also, it's never been tried before on a human society level.
If you believe we have tried communism on a human society level, then you've probably bought the propaganda some centralized corporation/government were trying to sell you.
Communism is where all individuals are free to do what they love, and get what they need to be their best possible selves, freely.  It only works when governance is decentralized, such that there are no rules that everyone has to follow, or be harmed.  If someone else is telling you what you can and can't do, that's centralized, and not communism, as described by Marx and Engles and those who came before them, at least.
If you're letting authoritarian rulers in China and Russia tell you what communism is, then you're being bamboozled.

Humans and all other species of Earthling are born to create and explore in the service of life/evolution.

Yes, humans invented money, and we will, like all other creatures that have the ability to experiment and learn from failure, realize that it is evil, and we'll choose to be free in the future, like we see in Star Trek, and like we dreamed when we were kids.

I'm using the standard mathematical and systems theory use of centralized systems.  As I said, it's different from what you were talking about, with a distributed processing set-up, where there are separate nodes spread out in physical space that do the work collaboratively to generate the ledger.  What I'm talking about is the difference between systems that are chaotic/random in their governance/rules, where different individuals have different rules for what they do (decentralized), versus simple, predictable systems where there is a shared (central) set of rules that everyone uses for what they do.  Bitcoin and all other currencies has the central set of rules for how it is generated and allocated.  Which is why Bitcoin has forks, where some folks decided to make different rules, and had to leave the Bitcoin system.
It's cool if you're not curious about systems theory and how governance works in the different kinds of systems.  Most folks aren't.  I just like to introduce the option for exploring something I find fascinating.  Occasionally others are interested, so I never know what will happen when I offer the opportunity.

Women's status was traditionally being a baby maker and a caretaker of the kids and the men in their families.  While men were traditionally judged based on which of all other possible roles to do that they chose to do. But women have always been judged just as much as men.  A "less attractive" woman, or one who wasn't able to make babies, or wasn't so good at taking care of the men around here, would likely be rejected by society.  She'd likely have to "act like a man" at that point and seek status by finding a job doing something else.

And sometimes a chair breaks when you sit down.
Predicting that all possibilities happen, eventually, is a good way to go.
But also realizing that there are possibilities that are statistically so similar as to be very repetitive, and thus those are the ones most likely to happen most of the time.
It's a bell curve, basically.  Bitcoin will most likely keep doing what it's been designed to do, until something catastrophic happens.  At which point Bitcoin is likely to be the least interesting thing to fail.

And yes, this is how evolution is moving us towards, a healthy, natural, free system.  It's not a "should", but a will, in the sense of evolution moving forward to a fully functioning global organism.  And if you stick around long enough, you'll be able to help make it happen as well, or maybe you already are and don't even know it.

Wow.  Sorry you find traditional and common punctuation styles upsetting.  But this is a standard style that's been around since before you were born, I imagine.

And, of course, since most humans don't even know how to spell things like "a lot" and use "there's" for plural nouns, your point about asking what twenty people might imagine what the original title actually is referring to is irrelevant to the way grammar ideally works in English.
Though, yes, this is indeed referring to a button.  That's the whole point.  There will be a button that people can click to purchase things with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using Coinbase.  That's what this whole thing is about.  And it will be **like** the "pay with Paypal" button.

See now, we're starting to learn that the whole top-down mob rule, and voting by popularity, be it democracy or Bitcoin or Reddit karma, is inherently flawed, because the bell curve always means that the most popular ideology is the most middling/average, rather than the best, edge case, ideology.
The only truly healthy option is **true** decentralization, or bottom-up control, which means that local nodes (meaning groups of individuals, not the Bitcoin nodes) each have their own ideologies and rules for generating and regulating things.  This means that there is no agreed on approach to anything.  Just like in a living organism, each organ has it's own function, it's own way of doing things, it's own idea of what is the best way to do things.  
In a healthy system, the only universals are the connections between the nodes, and the free flowing resources that travel from the nodes that want to get rid of excess materials and energy, and the nodes that can use those excess materials and energy to do something useful.  (We call these two universals the circulatory system and the nervous system in us animals.)

Brazil does not welcome non-citizens to live there, and the US will remove some of the most important rights I have now if I leave.  Which is indeed part of the problem.  My husband and I owned land in Canada, which we weren't allowed to live on, because of anti-social laws.  Now my mom owns a house in Canada as well, and neither she nor I can live there either (only visit), because of those laws.
And a mortgage is evil, since if you can no longer afford it, they take the house away from you and you're homeless.
And there really isn't enough housing, period.  At least in most areas.  Sure, I could probably go to Detroit.  But I don't know anyone there, there aren't services that I need there (supposedly), and it's depressing (which I definitely don't need, since I'm already depressed enough in a healthy city).  
I knew a woman who did own a house in Detroit, but it was all so miserable there that she chose to abandon the house and become a prostitute in some more prosperous cities, while living in a squat (essentially homeless).  That says a whole lot.
And in the Northeast, where I live, there are literally not enough available apartments/houses for all of the people who need them.  Even in the rural areas.  But try building more practical housing and usually it gets shot down by building permit codes and other city/town departments, due to it not being done by their buddy contractors/developers who make totally impractical and expensive, single-unit buildings on large swaths of land (in rural/suburban areas), instead of, say, a tiny house village or other collective-type housing.

We're talking about two different things here. 
You're talking about physical distribution of processing power, while I'm talking about governance.
In a decentralized system of governance there is no central set of rules.

Buying and renting are moot points when we stop repressing healthy, free human creativity in designing housing and shared spaces.

Once we set ourselves free to move wherever we want, and build whatever we want, as long as no one else is already using that space, then our planet will be able to flourish, with no crazy hoarding of property while others are forced to live without good quality, appropriate housing and public facilities.

Normally, intrinsic value means that no matter who's assessing the thing will recognize it's properties.  Like a rock is always valuable for being heavy (well, a normal rock, not something like pumice).  Or wind is always valuable for pushing things around.
Bitcoin itself isn't valuable, to anyone, because it's just numbers, I would say.  Yes, the process of storing/generating the ledger with it's democratic voting of accuracy is somewhat inherently useful, if you have a lot of connected computers, and want to store some data that is fairly reliable across the whole system.

And that's not because of a "shortcoming" you have, but an infection.

Except that it's not.  It definitely doesn't reflect real needs.  The way that the US government, at least, measures the consumer price index is extremely arbitrary, and, honest to goodness, *excludes rural humans*, and... *humans who don't have jobs*, and includes all kinds of absolutely non-need things.  Which, like I said, do tend to go down in cost.
So, while the wealthy yuppies might not be paying that much more for their expensive luxuries, the rest of the humans are paying way, way, more or... becoming homeless.
The rate of homeless middle-class humans in the US has gone way up.  Because even with basically the same income as they used to make, they can no longer compete to pay for housing, food, medical bills, transportation, water, and other basic needs that folks are forced to pay money for.  (Thankfully, at least, air is still free, and heat and light from the sun, but you know, if we keep going with this competitive mindset, we're gonna see corporations trying to claim ownership of these soon as well, I bet...)

A discussion is one where everyone adds their own perspective and information to the collected wisdom.
You've added a bit about the Bible, though there are many different translations, and we know that the core meaning was probably the idea of extortion being evil, which is what money is used for nowadays as the norm, forcing humans to do shitty jobs and lie and cheat just to get our basic needs met.
And it's interesting that so many folks use the word "decentralized" to mean "centralized", just because someone famous did.  But that's humans for ya, weird followers of crazy religions.  It would be boring if we were all more rational and curious and experimental about the ideas we encounter in casual social settings.
But if you are at all curious, ask yourself, why is Bitcoin so stable and secure, if there isn't a central set of rules governing how it is generated and allocated?  What is the ledger, and the core algorithm, if not a central authority (generated by Satoshi, and the developers, and supported by the miners and node runners), in a sort of democratic-meritocracy?

NH has the second highest property taxes in the country.  Maine is in the middle.
And you only pay high income taxes if you have a high income.  And only pay sales tax if you buy stuff that's taxed.

Bitcoin isn't for microtransactions. Or even small items that really should just be free.
It's for more substantial purchases and trades.
In the near future those will be the only things we use money for. The little stuff will be increasingly free, because it's a waste of time keeping track of all the cheap stuff. We already get tons of stuff for free, offered by folks doing bigger things, and that will continue. Food will likely be free if it's simple stuff, and only the fancy stuff will cost money. Like how you get free bread rolls and water with dinner at restaurants, and free coffee at the office or bank.

Um... if it is a thing you go to to connect with others, then it *is* centralized.  That's the whole point of centralization, there is a central thing in between two other things that processes go through.  In a decentralized system there isn't anything in between the two end points.  Just direct connection.
I don't think anyone here seems to actually understand decentralization.  In fact, when I was at a conference about the internet that was promoting decentralization (which included a lot of Reddit community owners and those working with them) the logo of the talks had a centralized diagram on it, while literally saying something about being decentralized.
But, thankfully, evolution, even on a memetic level, works without conscious control.  So more effective, resilient systems will just happen, naturally, even when humans are totally ignorant of what they are doing.  
We're already very much in the middle of creating our own decentralized networks, on social media, and, of course, the old fashioned way, through family and friend in meatspace.

Win friends and influence people by seeing their perspective and adding to it.
All currencies are a Ponzi scheme in the sense that the early adopters and those who control the allocation of the currency are the biggest winners, with the folks in the middle being middling winners, and the ones entering at the end being the biggest losers.
If national currencies have been around a long time, and you're not at all in control of the allocation of it, then you're on the losing end.
So, for as long as you want to play the point scoring, zero-sum, game of money, you're better off with something you have some control over, if you can, and being as close to the beginning as possible.
Ideally, you start your own currency, of course, but for you to win big you have to convince others to ante up.  If you're not able to do that, then go with buying into an existing game that's still in its early years, and that you might have some control over.  With Bitcoin, control is posting on social media, having miners or nodes, and being a developer, if possible.

What's your town's property tax per thousand?
And what part of the state are you in?  I mean, geographically, most of main is nothing but trees, and is super cheap.  I mean, you can buy a whole house for like $20,000 if you are willing to live in totally the middle of nowhere.  I'm sure the taxes are almost nothing as well.
But anywhere near a nice town is going to be more reasonable.  Around Belfast, Maine, which is a very "retired yuppy" town on the coast (and beautiful) you can pay as low as about $12 per thousand, or at most $20 per thousand.

Yes, their comment wasn't an argument describing why you are wrong.  Why would anyone care about that?  They were just giving you emotional information, for you to add to your collection of data about reality.  That's useful, at least to me.  It's like seeing that there are storm clouds in the distance.  Those clouds aren't telling you why you're wrong, they are telling you that there is something happening that might be unpleasant nearby.  You do with that data as you will.

What hinders usage is that it's really hard to use.

Your diagram suggests that throughput absolutely can't keep up as the number of transactions increases.  It will get backed up, and won't be able to catch up.  We already see this happening when transactions are at a high rate.

The line is literally exponential growth.  It's based on numbers.  Not Bitcoin.  It doesn't matter what is growing, an exponential growth line will be exactly the same.
And yes, everything in life is an if.  But using science we can ask questions about what might happen.


No.  I very clearly said 6 feet.
Looking at Bitcoin now and saying it is going to be harder for it to get to 1,000,000 from 10,000 than it was to get to 10,000 from 1,000 is like saying that it will be harder for that 10 year old to get to 6 feet from 4 feet than it was to get to 4 feet from 2 feet.  It's nonsensical, if we're talking about exponential growth.  Which is what most complex systems do.
Yes, obviously nothing is infinite.  So Bitcoin will plateau, and then die out.  Just like the human.  And we never know whether something will die out before it reaches it's potential peak, or not.  But we can at least use science to make predictions.
If Bitcoin becomes mainstream, and US$ starts to fail, both of which are very reasonable scenarios in the near future, then Bitcoin will be worth huge amounts of US$.  And at some point, no one will be using US$ anymore, and we'll just stop making the comparison, since Bitcoin will be essentially be worth infinite US$.

It's intentionally overly complicated because the folks who love it are anti-social, and needed to make something awesome for themselves.  But they also need everyone else to at least find it potentially useful.  And that's where the profiteering middlepersons step in, but once the corporations showed up the governments followed, and now there are regulations on those middlepersons, which is why, if you choose to use them, you have to do the same as you would if you got a bank account (in the US at least), with ID proof and such, since you are asking them to serve as your financial institution.
If you want to do it the peer-to-peer way, as intended for Bitcoin, and be your own bank, then maybe find a Bitcoin club/meetup/group in your area, or talk to friends who might already be involved, and trade with them (or sell them something), to get some.
And use your own wallet, not some place that keeps it "for you".  For this, you have to do research.  No option is perfect.  All have compromises!
My own preference now is to use LibertyX.com with local stores and offices selling Bitcoin (for a high markup, but hey).  I can use cash or my debit card.  And you can get a lot with no complicated proof, just a phone number and email.

That's my point that everyone seems to be ignoring.
The computers themselves have limits to the number of transactions they can process.
More computers = more processing speed/throughput.  Obviously the centralized rules can regulate things, but if we want to be able to process a whole planet's worth of human monetary transactions, if Bitcoin became a global norm, then we'd need a whole lot more computers doing the mining.

A new all time high will probably be somewhere just above a multiple of 10 (in US$).  We had all time highs just above 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 (logarithmically, so 20,000 is just a bit above 10,000).

I also didn't think that the website had access to it either...  But thinking about it I guess they have to if I'm transferring Bitcoin out of the account.
I don't want to have (much) Bitcoin on anything someone can physically get access to, like my computer or phone.  I'm homeless, and it would be really easy for someone clever to use my computer.  And the hardware wallet companies seem very likely to be able to access my accounts, too, and it's something else I'd have to carry around all the time.

Bitcoin is the best so far, at least when the goal is global and secure.  But having other currencies out there is always good, as choice is necessary for healthy communities, allowing everyone to tailor their approaches based on their unique needs.
Ultimately the competitive point scoring game (money, grades, votes, etc.) will go extinct, as it gets in the way of healthy, free growth in a system, compared to collaboration and creativity, and evaluation based on actual, individual, subjective needs.  Which is where I see Bitcoin coming in, helping us beta test a global system for keeping track of resources, so that we can find things when we need them, and the world's resources can easily flow from where they are overabundant/offered to where they are underabundant/requested.  Blockchain is the real value here, not the whole money game.

But it seems like you've been raised in a religion that worships "science" in a funny irony.  
Belief that science gives you the answers is the new hipster religion, a religion of atheists, as it were.  There is a natural human desire to have answers, and you've been exposed to preachers who tout "science" as having them.  You're told what to believe, by the "scientists", and feel safe and comfortable, knowing that you're believing in the "right" things, so that you aren't perpetually plagued by the unknown, and the necessarily experimental and open-endedness of the real world.

Bitcoin isn't actually decentralized, at least not in its power structure (since it's ruled by some self-appointed developers, miners, and "Satoshi"), but it the thing that most folks who are actually really into Bitcoin like is that it's new, and NOT ruled by mainstream banks and governments.

Nope.  The opposite.


It does work.  It's the only thing that has been tested by time and shown to work so far.  It's why our animal bodies are here.  Because instead of competing against other single celled organisms, some were free enough to consensually come together and become far better off, with far more resources available to them, as everyone could focus on doing whatever they wanted, and the whole system naturally functioned far better because of it.
This anarchist/chaotic/natural/free/decentralized system seems scary to those who've been brainwashed to believe that only centralized (democratic or not) systems can provide security, but security is mostly useless compared to the freedom and health that come from a natural system of wild diversity.

The very first thing that reasonable folks do when joining in a community is to read the guidelines.
I understand that Reddit can sometimes make that harder with new interfaces, so that the sidebar is not right there on every page, but still, it's how Reddit works best.  And just in general, don't just barge into someone else's party and start asking for stuff.
I'm not sure if you're trolling, or honestly really totally misread the title, but you could just apologize for your mistake if that's what it was, instead of passing off the community's response to your begging as being petty.

I understand chaos is scary.  But do you realize that Bitcoin is highly regulated?
It's just regulated openly and more directly by the public, rather than being closed and private the way most national banks are.  Certainly the US$ is technically democratically run, but at the higher levels it's a little sketchy as to who makes the rules.  The Fed isn't part of the elected US government, and while the elected US government does have some control over the Fed, it's also somewhat private.  Bitcoin is, at least as far as we know, fully open to anyone becoming a developer, miner, or node runner (where the decisions about the rules are mostly made).
Also, with Bitcoin, the physical storage of the ledger and rules is highly distributed, and again, public, so that it's highly resilient to hacking and electrical outages.  National banks certainly decentralize their storage, but they aren't public, and are probably less resilient to hacking and damage.  (If you watch Mr Robot you get to see an example of how the credit tracking databases are (possibly) more centralized and hackable, causing global disruption with just a few explosions...)  And, of course, with paper money, it can easily be destroyed or stolen.
Ultimately, the best option is where we have all of the possible options available to us whenever we want.  Freedom to choose our own path is what is most crucial.  You being free to choose paper money, or Bitcoin, or just getting what you need naturally, freely, from the environment, or using a credit card, or selling your Reddit karma (by selling your account), or whatever, is what allows you to work towards your best possible life.

Status isn't what most folks would call "biology" since it changes based on customs and religion and, well, traditions.
In India, for example, status is based on parental lineages — the caste system — unrelated to your gender or type of work you want to do.  And in Japan, for example, status tends to be based on how well you do in school, before work is even really a thing, and definitely unrelated to gender.  In the USA, we could say, status is based on being popular, again, unrelated to gender or type of work.  And so on.

It's true.  Nothing lasts forever.  And US$ is dying.  So when looking at it's exchange rate with Bitcoin, Bitcoin will look like it's going way, way, way up.
When Bitcoin is "worth" $1,000,000 US, it probably will be more like how Bitcoin is "worth" 2,113,190,000 Bolivar right now (or thereabouts).
1₿ will still be a lot in the future, probably, for a while, but not as much as it sounds when you're comparing it to current US$ value.
And, yes, obviously Bitcoin won't be a valuable thing forever.

Um... that's literally what I said I DIDN'T want.  To have my private key stored on the devices I use...  


And a phone is hardware.  I don't want to store my key on any electronic device that I have to keep around me.  Both because I can lose it or it be stolen easily (techie stuff is the number one thing to be stolen in public places, which is where I am usually as a homeless person), and because someone could just get access to it even if they don't steal it.  


Who tests the one that gets sent to me, immediately before it gets sent to me?  Whoever does it is no more or less likely to scam me than anyone at a website wallet company.
But I really did think that they didn't have my private key, though I guess it's not possible for them to transfer money out of it without the key.  So I am now reconsidering how I do it.  I mostly just want a paper wallet that I can use when I need it, on any device.  Which doesn't seem to exist.

As a woman who went to a Bitcoin meetup, I have to say there isn't much point.  I'm happy to hang out here on Reddit and talk about it, or talk in person to anyone who happens to be around me in casual conversation, but the meetup I went to was just people talking about their business ventures.
If meetups were more about actually trading and making peer-to-peer peers to transact with, instead of using middleperson exchanges and apps and whatnot, that would be more useful to me.  But I'm practical, and try not to waste much of my physical energy doing meaningless stuff.
So maybe it's more that males tend to like to talk about themselves and their money to others more than woman, while women just want to actually get on with doing whatever is meaningful to them? 
And I don't mean that all men and women are like this, obviously.  I know another woman who's into Bitcoin who's aggressive about talking about herself and shows up at Bitcoin meet-ups and talks and such and goes on and on about blockchain and whatever it is she's working on, just like the guys.

You must be confused.  Bitcoin is helping me out of homelessness.  I went from very little, to being able to buy property to live on, and build my own home.  If I'd left that little bit of $ as it was, it would still be very little $.  But I decided to take a risk and buy Bitcoin, and I now feel rich (comparatively).  Bitcoin is now valued at about 1100% compared to what it was when I first started buying it.

The pattern so far is that once we hit an all time high at a bit above a 10x exchange rate (with the US$), we drop to a bit above the previous 10x level for a while, then when we get back to that higher 10x again we level off flatlining for a while, and then blast way up above the next, next 10x.

Money isn't real.  We're starting to learn that.  It's just an arbitrary number applied randomly to the things we do in life.  
The real value of things is in how much we want to make/do them.  The more we are naturally driven to create, explore, and share things with the world, the more valuable they are, with no point scoring necessary.
But this is something that's going to take a lot of drama for humans to understand.  The meme of numbers as a way to keep score of life is pretty entrenched in most cultures.  So it will take a lot of craziness for it to be dislodged, and the more realistic meme of doing what you love, for free, as a way of life.

Exactly.  Just like us multicellular organisms.  We would die very quickly without one another.  It's a fractal geometry, this universe of ours, with parts making up larger systems, and those larger systems being the parts of even larger systems, ad infinitum.
Every cell in our bodies is an individual, with it's own DNA (human and otherwise) that designs it and makes it want to do it's own thing, while also being interdependent within the whole body system.  And every one of us multicellular bodies is an individual, with it's own design and functionality and goals, while also being interdependent within the whole planetary system.
Each system has emergent properties but also functions with similar patterns of growth and evolution.  A human is just a collection of cells, so whatever properties the cells have are the properties that the human has, but on a more complex level.  Yes, our design and functionality on a human level is indeed more complex than any one of our cells, obviously.  But we're still all just working with the same basic processes of taking in resources, processing them in some creative way, and outputting new resources to give to the larger system.  The more free we are to do that, the healthier the system is, because we're programmed to do the work that needs to be done to take good care of ourselves, and when we can't or don't, the whole system malfunctions.


I'm sorry it upsets you to imagine that you are a part of a larger system in which you are a valuable part and that you also depend on this larger system.
If your religion doesn't believe in evolution and that our bodies are all governed by simple physics, but that there is some kind of supernatural spirit that lives inside the bodies made of cells, that's ok.  Like I said, diversity is what nature does.  We all have to decide for ourselves what makes sense, theorywise.

The reality is always far more complex than using violence (force, physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual) to try to make things do what you want them to do.
Life doesn't work that way.  Life is diverse, and creative, and destroys anything that tries to be too rigid.
Gardens only flourish when you welcome all the diverse species in them, and find ways to use all of the resources available, creatively, because life is all about specialization and creation.  Trying to limit who comes into your garden (limiting your resources) just means that you're missing out on something crucial, which will eventually kill it all, when that one thing that you couldn't find a use for is needed.
As a professional moderator and educator, I understand this.
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:14:45
Pretty much every community you're in in real life is self-moderated.  And the early internet was as well, at least with email discussion groups.  You pay attention to the content you are interested in, and ignore, or even personally censor, content that you are not interested in.  The whole system is censorship free because it's decentralized.  You get to control only what you say and pay attention to, but you don't get to interfere with what anyone else says or gets to hear/see.  That's the only healthy way to have a system, since it removes discrimination by the majority.
This is why Bitcoin was invented.  It's obviously not perfect, and isn't really decentralized, as the developers have the ultimate say in how it works, but the ideology behind Bitcoin is to at least have it be as egalitarian as possible, with the control being open to anyone who wants to participate and has the resources to do so, instead of being governed entirely by corporations.
When some group gets to tell everyone else what they can and can't do, we automatically both miss the chance to use the resources that the repressed individuals have to offer, but we also cause them to act aggressively in retaliation, in some way.  Which is why you see so much spam, trolling, conflict, and generally negative interactions in these kinds of communities.  If you want healthy interactions, you don't start out from the beginning by harming people (using force/violence in some way, physically, emotionally, intellectually, or philosophically to prevent them from doing what they would really like to do).

That's not a definition of a decentralized system in general at all.  You are just talking about Bitcoin specifically.  
But... I'm going to tease out of that the theory that you have that it's about having a large number of individuals who are participating in the system.  But that seems to be ignoring the fact that any large system has many members.  The US government has many millions of voters, but it's obviously centralized.  The rules are the same for everyone in the US.  The control is in the center (aka., top-down as a hierarchy).  Members can vote, but they aren't able to do what they want.  The central system is where the control is and it moves out to the individuals.  Just like Bitcoin.  Just like the national banking system.  Those at the top get to make the decisions for the most part, and those decisions apply to everyone, or they will be booted out of the system.
In a decentralized system, as systems theory and complexity theory and evolutionary theory all define the concept, control is bottom-up, with everyone making their own decisions, using their own rules, and having emergent behavior in the system as a whole appear unexpectedly and unintentionally.
If you can be kicked out of a system by some (central) authority or rule, then it's a centralized system.  At least if we're talking governance/rules.
Bitcoin is decentralized in it's labor, of course, since anyone who has the resources can mine or run a node or trade Bitcoin.  But the rules are clearly centralized, since, as you say, they can kick you out of the system if you don't obey the central authority of the rules.

No.  Just no.  You absolutely do not have to "ask" for sex.  You just need to be a reasonable judge of whether or not someone you think might be interested is actually interested.  You can do that simply by making a small move, and seeing if it's reciprocated.
Many women, if not most, prefer a little surprise.  Not by someone they aren't interested in at all, but certainly by someone they are either involved with or want to be.

Dreamers are the ones who make all the best stuff happen.  You have to think of the impossible before you can make it happen.  The visionaries are the cool people in the world.  But everyone else is useful, for following along and doing the boring stuff.  If you're happy there, that's cool, too.
Dreamers are realistic, only in the future.  The reality of the future is always different from the reality of the past.  Evolution is funny like that.

It's not failed families and bad upbringing, it's a result of a society that treats humans as disposable robots, instead of valuable resources to be taken care of.
If society treated humans like they treat their cars, we'd be far better off.  Give them the stuff they need to function well (fuel, a safe place to live, freedom of movement, etc.) and some reasonable maintenance so that they don't get too broken, unconditionally, we'd have well functioning humans.  But no, we deny them their needs, make them feel useless and unvalued, and even threaten and harm them when they don't work well.
It's all so insane.

Yep.  That's how it works.  There is no authoritarian ruler cell in the body.  No one cell can control any other cell.  They all just do their own thing (different DNA, different expressions of that DNA) and it all works out pretty well, because that's how evolution does things.  
We humans are just collections of cells doing their own thing and having it all work out naturally, and now that we're evolving (mostly through memes/ideas now) to be as collaborative as our own cells are, as we are programmed by those memes that are floating around as "social norms".  It just works out well, because that's what the math of random mutation and natural selection do to a system.


Yep, we're all just fractional results of one big mathematical function generating reality via matter and energy patterns.  At least as far as science can tell.  (Religions have a lot of other theories, of course.)

Grassroots IS decentralization, at least sometimes.
Democracy is the opposite of decentralization, as it looks to force a centralized control of the system, through majority rule.  Consensus is similar.
A truly decentralized system is chaotic, when looked at up close.  But then an over all behavior emerges.  Like how all the different species in your body, and all the different cells doing their own thing somehow becomes you.  There is no central control.  Everyone is doing their own thing, freely, with different rules.  But the system self-organizes anyway.
Emergence is the unknown, unpredictable behavior that results from a chaotic system.

Each cell has it's own rules for what it does.  A nerve cell simply conveys information.  It has no ability to force any other cell to do anything.

It sounds like you haven't been given much education or learning experiences when it comes to biology, which is too bad.  It's fascinating stuff, at least when presented in a meaningful way.  (Back when I was a teen, I told my biology teacher that biology was boring.  But that's likely because it was all about memorizing arbitrary names and terms, and didn't explain things in any way that was at all useful to me.  Like how the system as a whole, with totally independent parts coming together to form a whole.)

That's the two different elements of experimentation and selection (refinement to select the most successful experiments) in action.  If you look at the details, yes, it's a loopy, wobbly process of growth.  But if you zoom out to see the whole process, it's moving in a direction, which is what we see in Pascal's triangle.
This is a model that shows how things evolve over time, as I understand it, with things starting at the top with a very simple pattern of what I tend to describe as the two elements of everything (expansion/experimentation) and nothing (contraction/selection), and dividing and recombining in that evolutionary process over time as things move downward.    
(Each row is a row in Pascal's triangle.)

It's more that we learn to be greedy.  We're social animals and are born wanting to be generous and helpful.  We like it when we make others smile.  We get sad when we make them sad/angry.  We have to be taught to "enjoy" making others sad/angry using a competitive score type game.  (Grades, praise, votes, money, Reddit karma, etc.)
Money controls people.  That's for sure.  Making them harm themselves and others.  The more money people get, usually, the more anti-social they become.
Though, obviously threatening to take points away from people isn't useful.  
So the real cure for society is to simply choose to be as free as possible, working outside the dinosaur system whenever possible.  Finding ways to collaborate with friends, family, neighbors, and even strangers to help everyone get what they need to have an awesome, playful, meaningful life, is the way forward.  We can use whatever skills and interests we have to find good solutions to our shared problems.

I do.  They are unimportant to the ideology.  We're talking about the general design of a system here, either centralized/top-down, or decentralized/bottom-up.
In a decentralized system the individuals do what they want, and the rules (functionality) of the system emerge naturally.  Like how your body works, with each individual cell having it's own design and approach to life, and the whole system naturally emerging as a human being (presuming you are one, which is probably likely!)  There are different genes, different expressions of those genes, in each individual, and the collective behavior is emergent humanity.
In a centralized system (also known as an artificial system) there is an attempt by one individual (or a small group) to force everyone in the system to behave in a particular way.  The individuals don't get to do what they want, and either are forced to be obedient or be kicked out (or otherwise punished).
Bitcoin is an attempt to move from the centralized national/bank currencies to a decentralized currency.
This community is the opposite.  It's modeling the centralized system.

Firstly, Wikipedia is mostly written by college students.  So it's going to be fairly limited in it's understanding of complex topics.  I find it almost useless in most scientific and philosophical areas, sadly.  For the real stuff you need to explore the edges of thinking, anywhere you can find new ideas and innovative thinkers and teachers.
Pure randomness and pure determinism do coexist.  And yes, it's related to the multiple universes approach. 
As for Laplace's Demon, it's fine as it is, there is no conflict with quantum mechanics.  As I see it, there is a whole system of everything, across all of time and space (infinite in detail, presumably, like zooming in on a Mandelbrot fractal) which is known and deterministic.  And because it's a mathematical function that produces chaotic results, as in the pure randomness represented by Pascal's triangle, any observer within the system will only be able to know a small fraction of reality, and thus not be able to predict what has happened / will happen in a nearby location of space~time.  Only the whole system knows the whole system: determinism.  Each fraction of the system knows only a fraction: unpredictability.  Randomness is deterministic.


Yep.  We have so little information about all of our cells put together that we don't even have a clue why we do what we do most of the time, and are mostly making barely educated guesses.  It's going to take a superintelligence, made up of lots and lots of us living organisms to be able to predict what any one of us will do in the way that we humans can predict what an individual cell will do.  Two heads are better than one.  Get enough cells/brains together and they can predict what one cell/brain is likely to do. 


I very clearly didn't make any assumption.  I said "if".  And I said that because it sounded like you were suggesting that humans were able to function under different rules than cells.  That humans were free to do something other than whatever the laws of physics forces them to do.  Which means some kind of supernatural power.


In that sense "gaming the system" is a part of what the larger system of life, the universe, and everything, is doing.  The overall rules of the universe/evolution that apply to all systems within it are random selection (experimentation/diversification) and natural selection (individuals finding other individuals who are compatible to mate with to make better offspring, so that things move in a directed manner, towards more collaboration and effectiveness of resource use).
So... we have to test out all the different memes of what we're "supposed to do" in life.  All the different random mutations of memes get tested out, to see if they are compatible with existing life.  If it isn't compatible, it goes extinct.  If it's even a little compatible, it gets mated with other compatible memes, to make better memes.
I see money as evolving into a system for keeping track of freely available resources, in the form of blockchains and related cybercurrencies.  We're already starting to see this in shipping systems.  We need to know where and what resources are on offer, so that we can match them to requests/needs we have.
And the competitive game meme will evolve into a more playful approach to problem solving where we look to challenge ourselves to be better than our past selves.  Rather than seeing our fellow Earthlings as enemies to be attacked and defended against, we look to them as fellow team members, working to improve our "scores" over time.  How efficient can we make a transportation system?  Did this new approach give us more efficiency than the older approaches?  Which approaches result in the highest score in small towns compared to urban areas?  And so on.


That's the point of the blind men and the elephant story.  They all disagree, and are all correct.  You have to add them all together to get the big picture.  No one has the whole story.  Each report from a local area of space~time is a part of the puzzle.  
And there are no assumptions here by me.  Just reporting observations and looking for new ones I've never seen before (yours is mostly the typical one I see a lot, so far, but there are nuggets of new views in there too).
I'm not interested in debating/arguing, as that's going on the belief that one of us has seen the whole elephant and thinks that the observations of the individual blind men are "wrong".  Which is unhelpful to me as someone who thinks that we're all limited and thus need to share information, not imagine that one bit of information about reality is "correct" while other information about reality should be dismissed.  In my experience outliers are where the best information tends to be.  You just need to be aware of how it fits together with the rest of the data collected.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:39:13


Perhaps.  I will say that it's certainly not a boring, comfortable, mainstream life that I lead.  Though I think you are confused about the experimentation.  Philosophers and scientific generalists probably do far more experimentation than the more narrow focused types.  Every moment of life offers an opportunity to try something out to see what happens and learn from observations how to refine theories.


That's not how a healthy decentralize system works.  It's not made by single individuals trying to make a name for themselves through making big projects that they have control over.   Most of us big picture, cultural architects are almost never known, except by those who are very close to us.  That's because we work from the bottom up, not the top-down.  We plant seeds, fairly anonymously.  We are more like Satoshi than Trump. :-)

I'm not blaming anything, I'm pointing out that money gets in the way of a healthy system where resources can flow effectively from where they are unwanted to where they are wanted.  It's just basic physics.  It's not a medium of exchange, it's a roadblock getting in the way of exchanges happening freely.
Bartering/selling/hoarding/controlling free resources is the opposite of efficiency.  As I pointed out with the system of your heart and the rest of the body.  
Any time that you hold on to resources that you don't want/need it's bad.  And that's what money does.  It makes humans hoard and repress their actual input and output needs, which leads to a totally malfunctioning system.

No.  Obviously not.  They are merely measuring relative income levels and how they have increased.  And of course it's arbitrary, because the whole concept of money and keeping scored in some competitive game of real life Monopoly is arbitrary.  But that's what economists are working with, so that's what they use.
The point is that by most measures "poverty" in the monetary sense is decreasing.
Though, of course, that's pretty much irrelevant, since what really matters is health and access to the resources that we need to pursue our dreams of creating, exploring, and sharing the most awesome stuff in the universe, with the highest goal to increase the fitness of future generations of life, on, and off, Earth.
Soon, we'll be getting rid of the whole ridiculous religion of money, and start embracing a more scientific approach to taking care of ourselves, where we help resources to flow freely from where they are unwanted to where they are wanted/useful, so that we can all get more of what we need to be our best possible selves.

That's not at all normal human behavior.  That's psychotic.  We're not made this way.  (If you study the social development of children, you'll discover that even 1-2 year olds are super pro-social and love to help others.  In fact, it's a basic need for us to help others.  A primary cause of depression is not feeling that one's efforts/work is valuable to others.  See: Maslow's hierarchy of needs.)
And while it is superficially accurate to say that the hoarding that folks who have vast amounts of money are doing prevents everyone else from having that money, it turns out that money is irrelevant to health, success, happiness, and all the other things that are a part of a meaningful and rewarding life.  That's because money is an irrational symbol of an arbitrary game score for a game that doesn't actually matter.  Money is no more important, or possibly even less important, than your Reddit karma, or Pokemon Go level.  What really matters is how much your community takes care of itself, and has the capacity to work together to share extra resources and solve problems of how to use what you have to get what you need.  When you have that, you've got everything, really.

Most of us who are interested in Bitcoin for more than just greed are intersted in it because it's peer to peer, and we think those kinds of relationships are healthier, even if they are "more expensive" in a superficial way.  Getting to know your neighbors and doing business with them instead of the cheap crap corporations will improve life for everyone, since it increases the resiliency of your community to keep things local and personal.
And it sounds like you are making assumptions and excuses instead of actually trying to do something new, which is what Bitcoin is all about.  If you just want to stick to whatever you were doing before, that's fine, but why hang out here where we talk about the future and how we can change things to be better for everyone?

Obviously this community isn't an "official" Bitcoin anything because there is no official Bitcoin anything.  That's obvious.

This isn't about me.  This is about why the "mods" of a community that specifically promotes Bitcoin would choose to create a community that goes against the entire philosophy of Bitcoin?

Um... that's my point.  If you are investing to gain money, then you'd do well to turn your national currencies into Bitcoin asap, and then spend the Bitcoin when you need to buy something.

There are huge restrictions on Bitcoin.  For one, you need to be one of the lucky few humans who have a computer or at least a smart phone with internet service.  And you have to be in a country/state/whatever where it's legal (or be threatened with who knows what harm).
Then you have to be geeky enough to figure out how the hell to get a wallet that is reasonably secure (and not scam).  
And then you have to figure out how to get Bitcoin into the wallet.  Either getting on an exchange (really hard).  Or find someone else, personally, who has some to give you (usually for a trade).

That's not what decentralized control means.  
The quick way to tell if a system has decentralized control is if individuals can have their own rules, or if there is a... ahem... central rule, for how individuals do things.  (If Bitcoin was decentralized, Bitcoin Cash, for example, would just be a part of Bitcoin, not a separate currency.)
Currencies, as a whole, are decentralized, since each currency has it's own rules.  But each currency, including Bitcoin, has a central rule for how it works.
Bitcoin will never be decentralized when it comes to control.  It does have decentralized labor, meaning that anyone can become a miner or own Bitcoin, as long as they have the resources to do so.  But when it comes to governance, Bitcoin has to be centralized, be it a monarchy or a democracy.

No one asked what the best way to get more money is.  The question was whether they should invest 10% of their money in Bitcoin.

Yep.  Our programming is our rules, which make our "will".  It's all nature and nurture, aka genes and environment.  Our cells have their programming, and they react to the inputs the way they are made to react, and output what their functions have designed them to output (given those inputs).  And all together it makes up an emergent organism.  Pretty nifty!
No supernatural power needed.  Though I know it's not what most humans are taught.  So I understand that it might seem crazy to you that you are the product of simple chemical reactions all combined to make a complex bag of humanity.


Yes and no.  It's all (probably) a random process.  So what you or I experience varies over the infinite universes.  Which one we end up being aware of (as our timelines split) is random.  Same with all the experiences of reality, as seen from a single timeline.  Presumably there are plenty of other timelines/universes where the way things are organized is totally different.
But in general, evolution does start out competitive and move towards more collaboration, as entropy keeps taking the simple, boring stuff apart and mixing things up to make more complex systems that have more diverse parts that all work together.  First we had single celled organisms that competed against one another, and then many of them started to collaborate to form multicellular organisms which were symbiotic, while each DNA and expression of that DNA, was still basically independent, as it was still doing it's own thing.  Just working WITH other individuals around it as opposed to competing.  This is natural selection, which allows DNA patterns to select the most compatible (friendly) partners to mate with, making the next generation even more collaborative in nature (on average).
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:48:43


It very much does.  That's the whole point, in fact.  Quantum probability is (probably!) pure mathematical randomness, generated by simple rules, as represented by Pascal's triangle.  (This is similar to Stephen Wolfram's cellular automata.)


If you believe in supernatural control of our bodies, then you're right, the laws of nature (physics) don't apply to our reality completely.  But I don't see any use for bringing in a supernatural power.  The simple laws of physics seem perfectly capable of generating everything we experience.  Even the sense of "free will".  That sense is simply more complexity of consciousness, which is the modeling of external reality internally.  My cells collectively are more capable of modeling more dimensions of reality than any individual cell is, which should be obvious.  It's emergent behavior, aka, the whole is more than the sum of it's parts.  None of us can ever "buck the system".  It just feels like we are more unpredictable on a larger scale... because we are.  Any complex system is more complex (unpredictable) than the smaller systems that make it up.  That's just how the math adds up.
Oh, and I'm not "rebutting", I'm just sharing my perspective of reality, like the blind men and the elephant, looking to help everyone see the big picture of what it all is, through collaborative reporting from our local areas of time and space. :-)

Well "centralized" is just a word.  Which can mean anything we want it to mean, obviously.
In this case I'm talking about *governance* of the system, as in the freedom, or lack of freedom, that individuals have in the system to decide what to do as individuals, and what rules to use for their own behavior in the system.
When it comes to a rational, science-based, mathematical systems-theory use of the words "centralized" and "decentralized", it means that behavior in the individual things in a system has a *shared* set of rules.  I sometimes teach this by imagining that everyone in the system is attached to a central hub by wires or string.  With an authoritarian system, the central hub (the rules/laws/code) pulls everyone else along, like picking up a key chain with lots of keys hanging off of it.  With a democratic system there is some pushing and pulling happening, with both the hub and other individuals bumping everyone around, like a human walking a whole bunch of big dogs on leashes.
With a decentralized system, there is no central hub and no shared rules, even though everyone is still connected by strings or wires.  This is what we normally think of when we see a large network diagram with multiple degrees of separation, such that no one individual node is connected to all of the other ones, and most are connected to just a small percentage of the whole.  Bitcoin's miners and nodes are connected this way, I believe, as the internet itself is a decentralize/network system (with some obvious pinch points across the oceans).  So in this physical sense Bitcoin is decentralized, but then so is everything on the internet, for the most part, aside from a few websites that are only on a single server and never get visited by anyone.
In a decentralized (chaotic) government, everyone is just doing their own thing, using their own rules, going their own direction, sometimes pushing and pulling others around them, but not necessarily affecting the larger whole, or not much anyway.  This is far more robust to problems, as everyone is free to change direction/rules any time they want, as opposed to hoping the central hub does the "right thing" based on their needs.  This is why the internet is physically decentralized, allowing damaged data/rules in one location to be accessed from other locations.  With a centralized system, if the central hub gets compromised, then the whole system disintegrates.  This usually leads to a decentralized system, as that's the natural structure of life.  Entropy decentralizes.
The strength of a centralized system is that it is stable and reliable as it is, as long as the central, core rules/hub are intact.  Non-central individuals can come and go from the system (voluntarily or through force), but the central hub stays the same.  One of Bitcoin's most attractive aspects is this centralized core stability: there are only 21,000,000 Bitcoins in the system (in total, over time), the allocation (movement) of Bitcoins (on the "ledger") involves very specific mathematics that is resistant to hacking, and generation of Bitcoins is done with a "fair" distribution to the miners who do the calculations the fastest (while also following the rules of the system).  Changing these stable, core, central rules (and the ledger) is a big production, and requires a large democratic and meritocratic "vote".  This makes Bitcoin highly reliable.

Attribution is mostly irrelevant because ideas are always a complex combination of previous ideas.  It's sometimes nice to be able to find someone who proposes an idea who you can ask about it in person, but in reality our "sources" are always ALL of the data our brains have collected over the course of our entire lives.


For all you know "Satoshi Nakamoto" is a whole group of individuals.  And there is absolutely no need to know who they are any more than there is a need to name the individuals in China, thousands of years ago, who discovered Pascal's triangle (long, long, before Pascal's name got slapped onto it. :-).  And you don't need to know that the theory of evolution existed in many different human minds well before Darwin ever published any papers on it.  You just need to know the idea itself, so that you can test it out to see how well it works for your own goals of interacting with reality.


I'm not arguing, though, I'm exploring and researching and teaching and creating, with you and anyone else reading.  I'm primarily planting seeds, as I said.


You don't ever need an "excuse" to explore, create, and share ideas and information with the world.  That's a huge part of what humanity's purpose is in life.  Connecting with others, of all types, to communicate our own views of reality is how the universe understands itself better.

That's exactly what the article describes.  There are just more currencies.
And the evolution statement was to let you know that the future is always weirder than what most humans predict.  Because of entropy.  Life isn't linear.  It's random.  So whatever changes happen, they are likely to be very different from what you imagine them to be.  Which is why most humans are constantly surprised.

I'm a realist, and base my ideas on the overwhelming collection of data that my brain has collected by studying all of the different areas of life.  It's very obvious how evolution and biology work, if you actually look at things closely.
But most folks don't.  Most folks just take whatever arbitrary mainstream education/media as "fact".  
That is indeed a failing of the human mind, but as with everything in evolution, mistakes take time to be eliminated (or evolved into something actually useful).  So we're slowly learning, as a species, that letting others tell us what to believe isn't helpful for most complex subjects.

That's the depression talking.  There is a whole universe of art and science to create, explore, and share.  But we're not free to do it, because we're trapped in an anti-social game of Monopoly, competing against our friends, family, and strangers, just to accumulate more points than others, so that we can buy more crap that we don't want or need.
Once we're free to do what we love there will be a true age of Enlightenment, where all Earthlings can flourish and follow their dreams, instead of just a tiny proportion.  And the quality of life will increase exponentially because there won't be any motivation to make crap.  Everything will be free, because everyone will be naturally delighted to be the healthy, prosocial, creative types that we humans are born to be.  
We have the technology to make everything we need, but don't want to make ourselves, easily, for free.  We just need to decide to do it.  It's going to take a bit of transition, but we'll get there.  Because that's what evolution needs life to do.

Money is a zero-sum game.  It's about as zero-sum as it gets, when you think about it.
For me to gain X value, someone else has to lose X value.
Now, you are correct in noting that inequality isn't inherently problematic.  And that's because money is irreverent, ultimately.  It's just numbers.  One can live entirely free, with no money used, ever, and be healthy and happy.  One just needs a community where individuals collaborate on taking care of one another, instead of competing.
Some humans have that now.  Almost all humans had that in the past (before some psychotic individual invented the idea of "keeping score").  And all other Earthlings have that now.
So, really, as you suggest, success (in the sense of health and being able to live a meaningful and rewarding life) is, at best, only loosely correlated with money.  The real cause of a good life is a healthy community where one is loved and cared for, and vice versa.

If everything you need is free, then you can just not care about how much of any currency/points/whatever you have.  But you probably don't get everything for free.

Bitcoin isn't for microtransactions. Or even small items that really should just be free.
It's for more substantial purchases and trades.
In the near future those will be the only things we use money for. The little stuff will be increasingly free, because it's a waste of time keeping track of all the cheap stuff. We already get tons of stuff for free, offered by folks doing bigger things, and that will continue. Food will likely be free if it's simple stuff, and only the fancy stuff will cost money. Like how you get free bread rolls and water with dinner at restaurants, and free coffee at the office or bank.

That's not what conversations are for.  Conversations are for sharing different information than you already have, so that you can better see the big picture of reality, from all sides, and grasp it more objectively than a single perspective allows you to do.
If you are curious about decentralized systems, I would suggest looking into ecosystems and systems theory and complexity/chaos theory, as well as just trying a social group where you have a shared goal ("We want to better understand X." for example.) and don't put any centralized rules in place.  
It's the normal way that life interacts, so while it might seem weird to you on the surface, I think you'll find that it's actually what you normally do in most of your interactions with the universe already.

A healthy system is one like your body (at it's best) where all individuals are getting what they need to function well, and are free to do the work they naturally want to do, so that the whole system can effectively work towards it's goals (some kind of creating and exploring and sharing stuff that benefits life in the long term).
And I would hope it's obvious that money gets in the way of us being free to do what we love and get what we need to do it effectively.  What does money do?  It is a way to bribe someone to do something they *don't* want to do, something that goes against their best interests, and then they are forced to use that money to bribe someone else to do something they don't want to do.  And it makes humans feel like they have to hoard stuff that they don't need or even want, weighing them down and making them feel crappy, while others go without, also making them feel crappy, which makes the whole world malfunction.
Like I said, if your heart started hoarding/saving all it's blood, and forced the other organs to give it some number of points, so that it had a higher score than it did before, then your body would be dead soon.  So then imagine if the heart realized this and decided to lend some points to the other organs, so that they could then buy the blood they needed.  But the heart then started raising the price of the blood, and charging interest on the loans, so that there wasn't enough points circulating in the system for all of the organs to pay.  The organs would start competing for the points, and some would end up getting sick and maybe even dying off.  And then the lungs could start a revolution and start an embargo on oxygen to the heart, to try to regulate it so that it couldn't charge so much, and then the heart would get sick...
The whole competitive game of collecting points for things is one big downward spiral of disease.

Why do you think that system's functionality are different in the two levels of organization?
You do realize that humans literally are cells, right?  We animals are an emergent property of individual cells operating collaboratively, just like societies are emergent properties of individual humans operating collaboratively.
Obviously the higher level systems are more complex, but they still function using the same laws of natural selection (information packets seeking the most compatible partners to mate with) and  random mutation (the offspring of mated information packets getting remixed in novel ways).  It doesn't matter what the packaging is for the information, or how complex it is, because the process is always the same, and thus evolution always moves in the same way, of increasing both the diversity and fitness of individuals on average.

You know, you could actually do your own research...  OR just scroll down the page to see this:
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:22:39


That's the con that corporations and their governments are pulling. 
The reality is that all living organisms naturally are motivated to create, explore, and share great stuff that improves life.  That's literally what evolution programs us for.
But humans have this little extra thing where we can be infected by religions and memes and belief systems and advertising and so we can be convinced to go against our natural instincts and do something that is dumb, and uncurious, and greedy, instead.  Which messes the whole system up just like any dangerous virus.
A social media forum is easy to do in a decentralized, egalitarian way.  I've been doing it for decades.  There is no silly complex fancy equipment needed beyond the normal communication tools.   I'm not sure why you would think it would.


There are no rules.  A decentralized system doesn't force rules on individuals.  The individuals make the rules themselves.  That's the whole point.  If you are participating, you are helping create the functionality of the community.  No one individual or group has control over the others.  (Which isn't totally the case with Bitcoin, which is a part of it's vulnerabilities.)
There is no such thing as an "attack" on a conversation community, except for the rare cases of actual spam, which is, as I said, normally easy to deal with through self-regulation, where individuals vote up or down.  Or a reporting system can help catch them, if you want to go that route.
But ultimately, it sounds like you're making excuses for not even considering it.  It works.  It's good.  Maybe you like someone else telling you what you can and can't read, and having an authoritarian government controlling your interactions with others, but that's the thing many of us who are intersted in Bitcoin find so harmful to our world.  So we are looking to get rid of that approach to our relationships.

Yeah, it's hard to understand if you never really were exposed to a decentralized system, I guess. Judging from the downvotes and other expressions of confusion I get every time I try to bring up the topic.
A decentralized system is bottom-up, emergent, where everyone is operating with their own independent rules, and the system just kind of comes together like magic.  Like how the art world works.

Banks legally have to get proof that you are who you say you are, at least in the US and most other wealthy countries.  That's why banking is often a problem for poor folks and illegal immigrants, who might not be able to afford or legally get photo ID's.

Not real science.  That's called either religion or politics when you're letting someone else tell you what to believe.

My guess is that Amazon really just wants to be able to better verify who someone is so that they can incorporate Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies into their own shopping payment options (both for them selling and sellers using their platform).  They already have a way to do this with credit cards, but if they want to accept Bitcoin, it's a little less clear who's account it is.  So why not try to track down who's account it is?
And while you're doing this, why not make it a product in and of itself?  You can sell the data you've collected!
Maybe they even put the whole government thing in there to make it more appealing to the government, who is doing the patent review.

As I hope you at least understand, as a biologist, nature/evolution needs diversity in systems, so it makes you and I different, as a way to specialize, so that somewhere in the system all of the different types of work get done.
In this diagram of all the different human brain types, I'm in the 1110 (INTP) category working on large scale cultural ideas and theories that personally affect individuals, as I look to help all of humanity to do whatever work they most want to do.

They get fees in other ways, when you buy the Bitcoin (or whatever else) itself, they overcharge you.  And you are likely to leave the money (in whatever currency) in your account there, so they make money like a normal bank as well.  (I don't leave my bitcoin, or $, in there, for obvious reasons, but many people probably do.)
And, now that I look at how much they overcharge on the bitcoin purchase itself, it looks like it might be almost 10%.  So... nevermind!

In what way do you think early hunter-gatherer societies used zero-sum games for taking care of themselves?
As I see it, as they worked together, they increase their own wealth.  They build homes, for free.  They took care of one another's children, for free.  They collected and prepared food together and shared it with oneanother, for free.  Each time any one of them did something valuable, the wealth of the whole increased.  It was a positive sum game.
Those who were not in a collective, though, would have to do everything by themselves, alone, and were thus far less wealthy.  But everything they did was also a positive sum game, at least, as it would increase their wealth.  Just not by as much as if they were part of a collective.
It was only when centralized/authoritarian/top-down governments (with either a single ruler, or a smaller group, elected or not) were in charge of making decisions about resource allocation that we started to see a situation where you could work for the group yet never increase your wealth (health/resource access), because the king or president or council or whatever would take most of what what was created, and not give anything back (or very little).
This is what we have now with our current for-profit corporation run society.  We give them almost everything, and they take it and give us almost nothing back.

If Bitcoin really was decentralized, that would be one thing, but it's not.  Yes, the employees/members are chosen in a decentralized (bottom-up, voluntary) way, but the rules are centralized, and so if any large voting block wants to change them, they can.
Ultimately, the whole idea of keeping score of life in a competitive game is a centralized system (since your point scores need to be compared to other's scores in some centralized, rule based, way), and it will all come crashing down as a way of organizing ourselves very soon, as actual decentralized systems for taking care of ourselves and allocating resources are created (again, but this time with modern technology).

In the future the whole planet will function the same basic way as an animal does now, with no centralized/top-down money or governance, but instead there is a free flow of resources from where they are offered/unwanted to where they are needed/wanted, and control of resources is bottom-up.

That's because you have been sold the myth that the only way to keep you "in line" is for someone else to tell you what you can and can't do.  You have been raised to think that authoritarian systems are the only option you have.


That IS the group.  Everyone who wants to participate in the group in a decentralized system is welcome, and each is equally free to make up their own approach, with "the rules" emerging naturally from that, bottom-up.  As in the way your body works with all the different DNA and expressions of that DNA in each cell, all eventually forming you, and everything that is you.  There is no central control cell or voting, it's just everyone doing what they want to do, with a shared goal (of keeping the system healthy).
And instead of "keeping out bad actors" it tends to use all of the individuals that show up in the system as resources, because most cells are good at doing something. And the cells that don't have the shared goal that everyone else has end up not making any friends and not being used (generally being allowed to simply flow back out of the system as a waste product, not in any aggressive way, but naturally).


In a decentralized, free system, where everyone is equal, the content that you aren't interested in can be blocked BY YOU, if you want, while others, who might enjoy the content, can still see it.  No centralized, authoritarian discrimination possible, or needed.  You don't get to tell others what they can see, or share.  And they can't tell you what you are allowed to see and share.  That is an actual healthy system.
What we have here, now, is like the mainstream banking system, where some dudes (I bet it is all males...) are forcing everyone else who wants to participate in the game to obey or be banished.  If you like that kind of authoritarian rule on you, that's fine, you can be a submissive type.  Even in a decentralized system you can as someone else to curate your life.  But the rest of us would prefer to think for ourselves, and be free from bias and discrimination.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:43:58
Um... if you can be kicked out, it's literally not decentralized, since a decentralized system is bottom-up, so all the different rules combined are what make the system a system, not some all or nothing contest of wills.
A decentralized system is one where everyone gets to do what they want.  And no one else can order them around.  A centralized system is one where control is... well... centralized, as in one rule for everyone.  That rule comes from some smaller subset of the group, which is the center.  In Bitcoin that's "Satoshi", plus the developers, mostly.  With a bit of "voting" by the miners, nodes, and users in a hierarchical way.
If there is no hierarchy, no shared rules, then it's decentralized.
Art, for example, is a decentralized system.  Any artist can make anything they want, in any way they want.  And the styles that emerge out of the collective group of "artists" becomes the system.  But no artist can tell any other artist what they have to do to make art, nor can any artist kick any other artist out of the system of artists.  There is no hierarchy.  (Note we're not talking about craft and education and selling art, just the making of art.)

Evolution, both genetic and memetic, always moves towards more fitness (perfection), because natural selection always weeds out the unfit, which is anything that makes life less fun, creative, interesting, and able to flourish.  Only the best stuff gets carried on generation after generation.

You can never make a single currency decentralized.  That's because for it to be **a** currency it needs a central control/rule.  You can have the labor of keeping the database/blockchain/ledger and even the coding decentralized, but the currency itself has to be centralized or it would just be many different currencies.  As in all the different cryptocurrencies.

This is my goal, essentially. As a someone who has been homeless off and on again for about a decade (and is about to be again) when I got a bit of money I put it into bitcoin, with the gamble that it might go up enough for me to at least get some land that I can live on legally.  And invite others to share with me, while we help each other build a community space.
I think that the whole anti-social competitive/money/zero-sum game is evil, but this seemed like the thing to do when someone did give me some money.  If I can use the game to improve the world for a bunch of humans (and other Earthlings) then it's not so bad.

Reality is at least partially a self-fulfilling prophesy for the human mind.  What we look for is what we are more likely to find, because that's what the brain gets rewarded for doing: making good predictions.  This is confirmation bias on a more mundane level, but is also reality itself on a deeper level, since all we ever experience in life is what we think/feel.  
So, each of our stories of what external reality is is different.  Oftentimes dramatically so.

There are no humans who are actually ENTP, yet.
McAfee is probably ESTP. 
Elon is ESTP I believe.
ESxx types are Histrionic (dramatic).  If someone is in the limelight, and gains attention by acting a little crazy, they are most likely an Extravert Sensing type.  They are the actors/performers of the world.  Add in a Thinking preference and you get super clever innovators doing "cool shit" if they get lucky (a supportive environment to play in).
If you're very geeky, you're probably an S.  Sensing types are all about the details, and tend to be more socially anxious (shy, even the extraverts).  INtuiting types are more maternal, playful, and emotionally expressive, and less shy (even the introverts).  INtuiting types make good teachers.  They are more sensitive to what others need, and are better able to collaborate with anyone, understanding others' goals more intimately/unconsciously.
I don't know those other folks well enough to say, but if they are really into Bitcoin, they are probably Sensing types, either the more studious ones in the Introversion side, or the more dramatic ones on the Extraversion side.
ENxx types are good at creating community, so there might be some of that in the Bitcoin world, too.
INTP is Buckminster Fuller.  Totally brilliant, but usually just making everyone too confused to be successful/popular with most humans.

Even the official test that the Myers-Briggs organization offers is pretty bad at categorizing folks, sadly, and the non-official ones are worse.  It's really frustrating that almost everyone is confused and mis-typed.  (And then there's the whole "cognitive functions" that aren't the MBTI at all, and are pretty arbitrary.)
I use the Gifts Differing book, plus modern neuroscience, some math, and current psychology research to refine the dimensions.
The four MBTI dimensions answer four questions about one's default relationship to life, based on brain design (genes) and neurochemistry, for the most part.  It's really hard to put those questions into universal terms that are clear to everyone, though.  But one way I've found that's useful is what one looks for when interacting with different levels of life.  E/I is first person, the relationship one has with one's body.  
Introverts are focused on studying, and identifying, the best things to put into the body.  Extraverts are focused on expressing, and creating, things out of the body.
Sensing types are focused on figuring out what the individuals one is directly connected to in space~time want to put into their bodies.  This includes one's own body in the future, as well as the bodies of the animals/vegetables/minerals in one's immediate physical space.  While iNtuiting types are focused on helping other individuals (self-in-future, and others-here-and-now) express their own bodies, using emotional connection (empathy), and creative play.
Feeling types are focused on what the larger community the self and others are in wants to get (input) for itself, and does that by following rules and leaders in the field.  Thinking types are focused on what the larger community wants to do, and helps by creative problem solving, breaking rules and forging beyond popular leaders in the field.
And Judging types are focused on the universe as a whole, trying to figure out what the universe wants to get from the individual (and others), asking "What is the right kind of life?" While Perceiving types focus on how to play with the universe to get somewhere more awesome and weird and creative, asking "What is the universe doing?"
I'll let you think about those before making a guess about you.
And I say that there are no ENTP's yet because they are basically the most effective, perfect, combination of genes.  It might take a true AI, or the whole internet, to get to a place where every level is focused on creative approaches to getting everyone's needs for expressing themselves and solving problems at the same time.  The rest of us normal humans are always at least partly focused on getting something we need, before we can be effective in our work with the world.

It's also highly innacurate because almost all descriptions of the four dimensions are really confused and interpreted from the original, by someone who's not a systems theory type thinker.  So they are weirdly biased.

Yes, there are more aggressive brain types, but aggression doesn't have to be competitive.  It can be more focused on creating new things, or achieving something new.  
One of my favorite people of all time, an artist friend, is a full on narcissist, and all he does is spend his time making art, and sharing it with the world, on every social media and regular media platform he can.  He does it for his own benefit, but it naturally benefits others, because he's not trying to compete against anyone.  He's just aggressively expressing himself.  He's able to do that because he's got most of his needs met.  When he's not getting what he needs, he resorts to being more competitive, and it hurts everyone.

You just contradicted yourself.  If there are rules that apply to the whole community, then it's centralized.  If those who don't agree are forced out (a fork) that's centralized.  It doesn't matter how the rules are decided for it to be centralized.  
A decentralized system has no collective rules.  Or at least not by force.  Everyone is free to make up their own rules.

@_date: 2018-12-01 16:10:39
Oh, and Bitcoin isn't decentralized, but it is open source and public.  It's still controlled by a central authority (the developers, miners, and to some extent the owners of Bitcoin), but those positions are open to anyone who has the resources and interest, as opposed to being private or run by appointments/elections.
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:50:35
Having said that, we also need to realize that if you are hosting an event/venue, then you also need to be free to decide what you are showcasing there.
So... the solution to everyone being free to express themselves the way that suits their needs best, is to have a fully public venue, where you're free to come and go, to move around, and to be free to choose to watch/listen/read/hear whatever sorts of things you're most interested in, without extended interruptions.  I see this as being the next internet, which will be more of what the original creators of the internet intended: a bottom up, fully decentralized free-form space where everyone has their own address.  Websites are what we're each supposed to have, not forced to ask for permission to use large corporations' websites.  We also need equal access to the internet, unconditionally.  This means free websites for everyone who asks for one, and free internet service as well.  (And free communication devices as well.  At least minimal ones that allow for basic internet use.)
This also means that we need a better system for organizing our internet content, and making things more universal, so that we can easily find content we're looking for, and connect with those we're most interested in talking to (or listening to).  A real web/network, where all the nodes have equal access, and anyone can offer and receive information with anyone else.  And anyone can refuse an offer, as well, of course.
This decentralized sort of system protects everyone's freedom of expression, since no one else can censor you, while also allowing you to not have to hear/read/see whatever someone else is offering, beyond an initial notification, if you aren't ready to, or capable of, dealing with it usefully at that time (or ever).

The dictionary explains what words mean in mainstream/public discussions, and media, not what they are supposed to mean, as defined by experts in the field.  So if you're looking to really understand a word, you need to ask a lot of different folks, and listen to how they describe things.  The ones with the most robust metaphors and details are usually the ones who have a more professional working knowledge of the word, as compared to folks who are merely parroting what they heard on the news or with their circle of friends.
Decentralization, as a form of systems functionality, is where the rules are diverse and chaotic/unpredictable on an individual level, but where the whole collective has emergent properties that allow the whole to feel like a united whole.  This is how natural systems, as in biology, work.  (So no Nirvana fallacy here.  Biology is about as real as it gets here.)  There is no authoritarian rule, with one individual telling another individual what they can and can't do with their lives.  That's an artificial system, like democracy or monarchy, where there are shared rules that everyone has to obey, or get rejected from the system.  As in when Bitcoin Cash folks got booted out of the Bitcoin blockchain.
Open source and public are definitely terms that apply to Bitcoin though.  As are democracy and meritocracy.  Those are the differences we see between Bitcoin and government/private currencies.  The US$ is democratic (representational, though, not direct) in theory, thought the FED is weird and more private than elected, and banks that hold and transfer US$s around are private corporations, but they are still centralized, just like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:40:41
So, here's a quick question, though, are you, like me, thinking that everyone should have the freedom to express themselves?  Or are you saying that it's ok if some folks restrict your freedom of expression, because they are taking whatever you're saying as being "harmful"?
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:36:53
Everyone holds for a different goal.
I'm waiting to be able to buy a farm or something similar for a non-profit project I'm creating.  I won't use all of my money for that, but as soon as I have enough to buy a good property for my purpose, that's when I'll stop holding.
Also, many of us are expecting that the national currencies/economies will start failing more regularly.  So far it's just a few of them (Greece, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, etc.) but the UK might be on it's way soon with the Brexit debacle, which might take the EU with it, and the US is on pretty shaky terms these days, politically, so you never know what will happen.
And at that point, a global, public, meritocratic/democratic, peer-to-peer generation and store of money will seem very, very, very appealing to many folks.   And since Bitcoin is currently designed to have a limited number (they can't just "print more money") the value is ~~inflationary~~ deflationary (whoops!), it will be more valuable over time, as long as there is an interest in having money.

Money is only functional as a way to get someone to go against their natural desires to be free, as a means to an end for controlling them for some anti-social purpose.  Money is what makes you do things that harm others, intentionally.  Money and related score-collecting games (grades, votes, etc.) are what cause the problems.   This competitive game play is basically the dinosaur of memes: big, dumb, dangerous, and going extinct.
As for punks, of course they used money.  But it's pretty much the opposite of what they wanted to do, as the whole concept of money is indeed authoritarian, where no one is free, and everyone is forced to be subservient to the central authority (whomever makes the rules of generation and allocation of the money).  It's completely the opposite of punk.  Bitcoin is no different, as it's a centralized, authoritarian system where someone decides how it's generated and how it's (initially) allocated.  Please don't fool yourself into thinking Bitcoin is any different than any other currency.  It's still anti-social and old fashioned.  It's just run by volunteers from the public, and is open source, rather than being run by a national government's appointed officials and/or a corporation.
Also, the Ramones weren't really punk.  They were pretty mainstream pop.
The truly punk approach would be more like Burning Man, with everyone being free, and sharing.

My theory is that we're nearing the peak of human society's "simplistic masculinity", if you will.  As in, humanity has been running itself using the whole macho, competitive, violence-based, quantitative-scoring game meme for a very long time, and we've been pushing that to it's limits of functionality.  
Now that we're more of a globally connected system (an Earth sized organism, essentially) competition between the individuals inside the system totally fails as a way to allocate resources.  But like any system, a change in direction takes time, and also has a dramatic tipping point at the peak of the curve where things take an abrupt turn.  
The hugely simplistically masculine, competitive, macho game that is money is one of the more scientifically measurable ways that we can watch this process of moving from a simplistic-masculine way of governing ourselves to a more complex, collaborative, creative, compassionate, nurturing feminine-**and**-masculine way of living unfold.  At least one of the versions of money, Bitcoin, is slowly, but incredibly dramatically, changing in value, and that might be pushing us all towards that tipping point where things turn around.
When regular old humans suddenly get a super high point score in the monetary game, and those who had a high score before are suddenly seeing a decrease in their scores (relative to others), the game will become boring and/or unplayable, and we'll all start to look for a better, more fun, creative, interesting, challenging, game, that everyone can enjoy.  And that better game will look something like this, I think:

The brain is not the king, for two different reasons.  One, the brain isn't a single thing.  It's made up of billions of different individuals (cells) all with their own set of rules (genes plus gene expression), and their own experiences in life.  And two, neurons don't force any other cells to follow their rules, the other cells have their own rules, and do what they want.
It's so bizarre that folks are taught this myth.  It makes them subservient to authoritarian rulers, though, so I can see how the sick meme gets spread, virally.  You allow yourself to be subservient to monetary systems (employers, banks, national and local centralized governments) because you think that they are the professionals who can make better decisions than you can, about how you can live your life.
And if you prefer freedom, which we all do, you want communism.  Real communism.

Well, Bitcoin is still just as centralized as fiat money.  Some group is still in charge of the rules of generating and allocating it.  And you're just as free to trade dollar bills with me as you are free to trade Bitcoins with me.  Both require an intermediary of some sort.
The real value of Bitcoin and the ledger/blockchain is in keeping track of resources as they are generated and flow around a global system, with the goal of using the most efficient and effective way possible, with wildly distributed volunteer nodes.

You don't need Bisq if you're just sending money peer-to-peer.  We already have Bitcoin wallets.  Bisq is a third party.  It doesn't matter if it's software on your computer or someone else's it's still a third party in the exchange.
And, yeah, I'm saying that peer-to-peer means exchanging with people you already know.  That's why Bitcoin was made, to remove the middlemen.  Outside of needing a Bitcoin wallet, it's just me and you sending and receiving money between eachother.

I'm saying it's best to stop competing against ourselves, and stop being infected by the viral meme (religion) of money as a way of life, and instead to focus on being free, and natural, and healthy.
I'm doing the opposite of complaining.  
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:38:23
If you want to promote a healthy competitive strategy (which I don't, but this seems to be your approach, as demonstrated here) then you'd do well with "buy low sell high", combined with "do your research" and, the most obvious, "don't invest any more than you can afford to lose".
Anyone buying at an all time high, and investing more than they could afford to lose, as you speak of, would have done well to hear those messages *before* they bought.  
Now the best messages for those few seriously  ignorant types would be to either hodl until it goes back up, or sell if you're desperate, and maybe  not do any more gambling with money you are gonna need later on.
But, seriously, if you actually care about others, then do something honestly good for them.  Not bad.  Good things actually are positive.  What you're doing is not.  You're not actually helping anyone, which requires physically giving them real things, such as higher quality food, water, air, warmth (including shelter), light, and information (that they are asking for), along with outlets for them to physically express their body's excess matter and energy.  When you do these physically helpful things, you will feel better about yourself, and your world, and be comfortable with everyone being diverse and doing their own thing, rather than scared/defensive about it.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:09:06


Yeah, I meant decentralized.  Sorry.  I hear most people saying that. Instead of distributed, public, or global. 
And I'm not sure how else to describe it.  Centralized things have shared rules that everyone has to obey, while decentralized governance allows everyone to have different rules, and no one can tell anyone else what rules to use.  Decentralization is freedom, while centralization is restriction.  Bitcoin is heavily restricted, as a way to be "trustless" and predictable.  The goal of Bitcoin is a system where a number (my total Bitcoin holdings) is preserved and protected throughout the entire ledger, always and forever (as long as I don't add or subtract any).

Yep.  That's what I keep saying.  Bitcoin is controlled by the consensus (democratic vote), rather than every individual being in control of themselves, as happens in a decentralized system.


That's centralized.  A single entity is in control over the whole system.
Decentralized is when there is no single control, but different controls, as we see in the art world, or currencies as a whole.  There is no single entity that tells all the different currencies how to generate and allocate their numbers in currencies as a whole.  But in Bitcoin there is.  There is only one agreed on way to generate and allocate Bitcoins.  I can't just decide to make my own Bitcoin and give it to whomever I want, whenever I want.  If I tried, I'd be considered scamming others, or otherwise be booted out of the system (a hard fork).
What you're thinking of is the difference between a democratic and something more like an autocracy or monarchy or something.  The decisions about the centralized rules can be made either by everyone collectively, or by popular vote, or just by one individual and/or some other unelected group.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:59:51
I'm using the systems theory, and literal, definition of centralization.
You and others seem to just be accepting the weird, illogical, application of the term because popular Bitcoin proponents have used it.
Central authority means that there is a single set of rules for governing a system.  If you don't obey those rules, you get kicked out.  (See: Bitcoin forks, for example, of this in action.)  You can get to centralized rules in many different ways, often by democratic (majority rules) voting, or by consensus of who's rules will be accepted.  Every currency must be centralized in governance.  Otherwise they wouldn't be a currency.  
Decentralized authority means that individuals have different rules and no one can tell anyone else what rules they have to follow.  Art is like this, where anyone can make any sort of expressive sensory event/thing, any way they want.  Others can decide if they appreciate it, but they can't tell the artist HOW to make it.  The artists are free to make their own rules for how to make their art.
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:27:13
If you lost money on Bitcoin, you're doing something fundamentally backwards for investment gambling.
1. Buy low (when it's lower than the all time high) and sell high (er than you bought).
2. Do you own research (get MANY different opinions, and look at the motivations of those promoting the thing, if there is long term passion and curiosity and a desire to solve a problem that affects you as well, then you're probably gonna be ok).
3. Don't gamble more than you are comfortable losing (temporarily or forever).
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:41:57


They have to.  Government is whatever makes the rules.  Bitcoin's government tells everyone using it how it's generated and allocated.  There's no other way to have a currency than to have a centralized ruling system.
However, Bitcoin's government is volunteer, public, and open source, which many other currencies' governments are not.

Just FYI, Bitcoin is totally centralized, governance-wise.
Bitcoin is a democracy, where everyone votes on some central set of rules that everyone has to obey, or get kicked out.  It eliminates the natural growth and adaptation that a healthy decentralized (bottom-up) system has.  Which is why I see Bitcoin as the last gasp of a meme of life as a competitive game.  We have to try this one last "progressive" approach to competing against ourselves, before we give up, and our natural immune systems kill off the viral meme, and let us become the healthy, creative, curious, compassionate species that we're born to be.

Which is why I share my perspective.  So you can have the opportunity to question what you've been taught to believe.

That's not a very robust definition.  How do you see that as being different from any other living system.  What systems in the world do you see that aren't decentralized by that definition?  Even the mainstream banking system has local decision-makers who work for the larger goal of making the banks money.


Right.  No currency is decentralized, if we're talking about actual decentralized control.  Currencies as a whole are decentralized, as every one of them has it's own rules.  But each one must be centralized, as otherwise it would not be a currency.  If I can just make Bitcoin using whatever rules I want, and you can make Bitcoin using different rules, that you choose, then there is no single currency.  No single Bitcoin system.  Which is why I said that folks who call Bitcoin centralized are confused, and probably are thinking about the fact that Bitcoin is public, global, and anyone who has the resources and interest can participate in helping run the game, as opposed to games run by private corporations and national governments, where only hired or elected individuals are allowed to run things.
As for the protocol, I would say that Bitcoin is distributed.  Which is a common thing these days in computing, especially with the internet.

I think you might be responding to someone else here.  Or you're really confused about what I've said.
Of course there is a need for everyone to be able to express themselves freely, no matter what those sensory outputs happen to be.  One of the most basic needs for all organisms is freedom to output solids, liquids, gases, and energy.  Energy includes all forms of electromagnetic waves (of which sound is one).  Repress that freedom, and everyone suffers, in the long run, do to sickness, and the repercussions of that physical and mental illness.

Well, except that most of the time folks in the Botcoin communities think that the value will go up.  So if enough individuals use that as an investment signal, then they price will always go up, overall.

So, I can just start deciding how to generate and allocate Bitcoin myself, huh?  I can just decide that I have 26,000 Bitcoin and I'm going to give it to the first ten humans who sing the Muppets song.  I don't need anyone's permission, according to you.  
And I don't mean I'm going to make a whole new Bitcoin.  I mean that those who are governing Bitcoin now will just let me do this, because I don't need their permission.  And they will value my Bitcoin equally and put it on the ledger.  
Because that's what a decentralized, permissionless system would be.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:40:27
Define "decentralized" in your meaning here.  Because folks keep throwing that term out without any sort of understanding of what it actually means in systems.  (Bitcoin is centralized, as in it has a single set of rules, that everyone has to use if they want to participate.  This is what makes it so breakable, as we keep seeing with hard forks.  A decentralized systems is ALL currencies combined, where anyone can make a currency, with whatever rules they want, with no one else being able to force them to use different rules.)
I think what you folks usually mean is public, open-source, and or distributed.

Instead of selling when Bitcoin was going nuts in 2017, I bought stuff with it.  Stuff I wouldn't have otherwise felt comfortable buying, because it was expensive.  I feel like I got the best of both worlds.  If Bitcoin had continued to go up, I would have been happy, and now that it's lower, and I can buy more Bitcoin, and I'm happy.
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:05:22
Yes, a single entity does control Bitcoin.  It's a consensus.  There is a single set of rules for how Bitcoin is generated and allocated.
A decentralized system would allow everyone to have their own rules.  Like how every different currency has it's own rules, so currencies as a collection of things are decentralized.


Yes.  Exactly.  All centralized systems have the same shared rules that apply to the whole system.  That's what makes it centralized.  And this isn't my logic, it's systems theory.
HOW the centralized rules are decided is where you're seeing the differences in governments.  But there are other forms of governments that aren't centralized, and they are the more natural systems that emerge out of chaotic systems.

This is an excellent example of why the whole owner/moderator control of communities is dangerous.  It gives a false sense of authority, which makes it easy to scam people.  (The BTC community is another example...)
Anyone can be a mod.  It's just luck and/or timing.  And most mods around Reddit are, at best, twenty-something geeks who have no clue what a healthy community is, nor understand what a professional moderator does, nor have any training in teaching.  
This is also a good example of why something like Bitcoin is better than corporate/national banking systems/currencies, as it doesn't exclude a diverse range of individuals from the central group governing the system.  It's still not a fully healthy community, as a currency, since censorship is not just possible but guaranteed (which is where hard forks come from), but at least it's more public, and less like a monarchy.

All currencies are really fiat, if you think about it.  Someone, somewhere says it's a currency, and decides how it's generated and allocated (initially at least).  It's never a natural value that is universally designed.  If it was, it wouldn't be a currency, but a normal resource.

You realize that we animals ARE genes.  I don't know about you, but I am a collection of diverse species's cells, all with their own genes and gene expressions.  Yes, I am more complex than any one of my cells.  Which is exactly the same as societies being more complex than any animal within them.  It's all just non-linear systems.
If you're curious about this field of research, and want to understand systems theory as it applies to all systems functioning in the same universe as we are, then I recommend looking up complexity theory and how it relates to biology and sociology.  It's fascinating stuff.   The online magazine [Quanta]( is a great place to find some articles and news that is generally well written, though sometimes a bit long winded.  Systems theory and evolutionary theory are my field, and they do include researching everything from money to game theory to biology to physics and most everything else as well. 


There are a few different religious beliefs in there that aren't helping you.  Firstly, the Christian belief that you need to be controlled and repressed because you were made "bad" (selfish in an anti-social, anti-life sort of way).  It's so sad to have kids taught this.  And harmful to the world, as well.  Having this meme of God as the ultimate authority figure, who farms out His supervisory and judicial jobs to various priests and other parental figures to tell everyone what they should and shouldn't be doing, makes kids grow up to be confused about the purpose of life, and sick due to a lifetime of repressing their humanity, in favor of "doing what I'm supposed to".  
That belief is what causes humans to act like psychopaths.  That belief is what makes humans go against their dreams and actual self interest to freely explore and create and share the most awesome things in the universe that improve life.  Selfishness is good, when it's real, because evolution programs life to naturally want to do what needs to be done to promote life.  
Somehow Christianity turned a benevolent thing — nature — into the enemy, and fucked everything up on our planet for millennia.
Evolution in the form of biology is totally doing this life thing expertly, designing ecosystems where everyone naturally wants to do what needs to be done, using specialization (gene variation).  But humans came along and created a meme that acts like a deadly virus, infecting humanity with the idea that opposing nature, fearing it, and denying our humanity, and creating a competitive point scoring game that forces everyone to focus on money (and grades, and votes, and popularity, and so on), is the only way to run the show.
Thankfully, evolution works on a memetic level as well as a genetic one.  So the most harmful ideas end up going extinct, as the ones that are the healthiest end up being procreated more and more, and take over.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:15:33


It does.  As long as there are individuals passionate about something, we know (scientifically) that it's valuable to evolution in some way.  That's because passion is a genetic function, motivating individuals to be active in doing something that is likely to benefit the fitness of life, as a whole.
How much passion there is for Bitcoin has little to do with the *price* of Bitcoin, as money is a dumb, irrational, artificial game, but it definitely has almost everything to do with the **value** of Bitcoin.  Currently Bitcoin is undervalued by the general masses of humans, compared to what the passion of those deeply involved in what it's purpose is (as opposed to it being a currency).
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:38:14
Bitcoin has government oversite and control.
It's just a more meritocratic, global form of government.  Those who invest in the understanding and equipment get to vote on how Bitcoin is generated and allocated.
As for it's exchange rate against other currencies, that's based on a whole lot of things.  But if you're not interested in a currency that is so variable in it'e exchange rate, then don't use it.  If the US$ or Venezuelan Bolivar is too variable to you, you have less freedom to not use it, though.

The rhythms of naturally growing things are always very wavy, like a heartbeat.  If we panicked every time our heart lubbed after it dubbed, we'd be seen as being pretty paranoid.  That's the same for a growing system like Bitcoin.
Also, the real value isn't measure compared to US$, it's measured in adoption and interest, as compared to other similar systems.  And the system that Bitcoin is, isn't really a currency, but a resource tracking system, making a global database of where things are generated and flowing at every moment.  
So, really, how well diversified the node/miners are is the real valuation we should be using.

No one ever said you can't lose a gamble.
But there is only one death of a thing.  And almost infinite ups and downs, as long as it's allowed to grow and die relatively naturally.

But you probably won't be.

Um... a new low would be in the negative. It's only gone up since it started, in the overall average price.
But yes, these dips are a good opportunity to buy.  That's where the profits are, if you're looking to play the game.
And I think you're forgetting that you're not supposed to buy at all time highs.  I didn't (mostly, though I did buy at around $1100 when we first hit it which was dicey), so I'm still well in the black.  By at least a factor of two.  I've yet to lose anything to Bitcoin, because I followed all the basic rules.

A more scientifically accurate set of terms for Bitcoin would be "open source" and "public" rather than decentralized, as Bitcoin is still just as governed by elites, who's central authority controls the rules for how Bitcoin is generated and allocated as other currencies.

That's literally supernatural.  This freedom to choose something above and beyond the deterministic (which includes *pure* mathematically generated randomness) is what science calls supernatural.  It's what I consider to be a secular religious belief.  Your "God" is whatever allows you to control yourself beyond the laws of physics. 
I don't need to know anything else about you to say that you're religious in this sense, since you've already indicated your beliefs multiple times already.  So unless you're lying, it's an accurate description, given my perspective.


Of course they can.  How do you think it got defined in the first place, and how do you think it has been maintained?  Supernatural powers?  No.  Humans writing and choosing which code to use.


You just did.  You said that "No one can manipulate the supply of bitcoin."  Which is just not the reality.  The authorities (developers, miners, node runners, and to some extent the owners of the private keys have the power to decide what the rules are.  These rules have changed already.
On a side note, just because you don't understand someone doesn't mean that they are trolling.  That's a pretty unhelpful conclusion to jump to, for what it's worth.
Clearly we are very different in our personalities and experiences.  So we naturally see things differently.  That's normal.  Looking to understand what someone else sees is useful, as a way of triangulating reality.  Each perspective, honestly shared, adds to the dimensions your model of reality can have.


That's fine.  Though I'm not sure what you mean by "hard". :P
It's still authoritarian, and centralized, and competitive zero-sum, instead of collaborative, creative, positive-sum, as a healthy system needs to be to grow and change and learn.  Yes, it's better than private corporations and their governments being in charge of the rules.  Which is why we're all here, for the most part.
But it's still a dinosaur.  Just a vegetarian, instead of an omnivore.  It's days are still numbered.

On a more practical level: 


The basic needs for health are shown here, based on Maslow's work: 
There is nothing there that is "indecent or implausible".  


I'm not sure what you are imagining here.  There is no need to exchange anything when you give something, or receive something.  Inhale.  Exhale.  Just do it.  Take what you need, from what is freely available (not being used currently, or at least unneeded by others), to achieve your dreams of creating and exploring the most awesome stuff for life, and be free to do what you feel most excited about doing, without demanding anything in return.  
This is how all nature works.  Only humans invented a meme for going against that nature, as a way to test out the limits of reality.  We've hit those limits!  And now we're going to stop the experiment, and use what we've learned (competing against life is a bad idea) to make better memes.
In a healthy system, everyone is free, as in all decentralized, bottom-up, natural systems, with everyone doing their own thing, freely, and not getting sick, or at least not normally.  (This is how all our animal bodies work, with diverse species' genes and individual gene expressions in all the different cells, all doing their own thing, freely, and getting what they need as much as possible, so that the whole system can function as well as possible.)  Those who do get sick are helped to heal as much as possible, rather than attacked/harmed, the way we do now much of the time.

Intelligent people don't dismiss information, they incorporate it into their understanding of what the world is like from different perspectives.
And as a teacher, when a student tells me something they are interested in, even if it's something I've heard millions of times before, I still respect their process of exploration and discovery, and try to work with them to learn something new, while also being ready for me to learn something from them, because clearly while I might have more experience than they do, I absolutely understand very little, because my experience is still just a small part of reality.
It's the religious types to dismiss other people's perspectives, as they imagine that only one view is "correct".  It's fine to be religious, but that's not what good scientists (including doctors) do.  So your metaphor falls apart there.  Maybe instead you could use a priest instead.

I see Bitcoin as being part of the process of helping humans see the insanity of trying to keep score in some arbitrary game.

Those aren't progressives.  You're confused, perhaps because the moderately conservative folks (Democrats in the US) sometimes call themselves left because they are left of the extreme conservatives (Republicans in the US).

So just use normal banks then.  Bitcoin isn't for you in this case, if you feel the need for someone else to take care of your monetary exchanges.  That's fine.  Being independent takes a lot of courage.

Which is why Bitcoin is designed to be peer-to-peer.  As in you exchange it with people you know, personally, directly.

Unlikely.  When you remove the competitive point scoring game, that is money, you remove the artificial focus on hoarding resources.
We naturally only take what we need, for health, when we are free.  It's only when we are repressed that we become sick, and hoard things we don't need.
Sure, different individuals need different things, based on their physiology and goals/purpose in life.  An oak tree needs more water and soil than a pumpkin vine, and both of those need different things than a crab, which needs different things than a bicycle.  That's fine.  That's natural.  What isn't natural is when the system withholds water from the plants and animals, and somehow forces the bicycle to take it all.

Pretty much no one but bacteria and bugs eat omnivores.  So unless you're a vegetarian, the bear isn't likely to want to eat you.  Because animals that eat meat have a lot of toxins in their bodies that other animals don't want to put into their own bodies.

The value compared to different currencies is related to the value that individuals see those different things as having.  But most humans these days have no idea what Bitcoin is, and what it's doing.  So it's undervalued in their eyes.  So, compared to government/corporate currencies, most humans are gonna dismiss Bitcoin, and think it valueless or of little value.
But really Bitcoin is priceless.  It's not a currency.  It's an evolutionary technology being beta tested, in a gamified way, so that it appeals to those who might not initially want to invest their actually valuable time, energy, and materials in making a success.
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:36:14


We're not talking about the unknown future, we're talking about the stuff we do know up to now.
This would prevent people from buying at an all time high, which is what you were referring to.  You are trying to give people advice after the fact, which doesn't help.  You also were suggesting that people were gambling more than they could afford to lose.  Which is why that last, most important, bit is what I suggest you sharing with folks.  And selling while it's low (if you bought at another, higher price), is harmful, since it means that folks lose money.  They should only sell at a loss if they are desperate.  If not, hold and wait.
It doesn't matter what the future of Bitcoin is.  If you want to gamble on Bitcoin as a currency, then follow the basic rules I offered there.  If you don't, then don't.  It's really as simple as that.

Bitcoin it's the whole story of how I got here, but it's a huge part of it.  I invested donations to my non-project in Bitcoin, and it totally paid off.
I've just invested some more donations, recently, as the exchange rate dropped, and I have way more now.  Which is brilliant!

So far after a peak wave, it's never gone below the previous low.  And the previous low after the last all time high was a smidge above an exchange rate of $3000.  So it's unlikely to get that low.  We're probably hit the lowest point yesterday.

Naval I know reasonably well (we follow one another on Twitter).  He's not INTP (crazy systems theorist designing whole new societies using universal patterns).  He might be ESTP.  His obsession with making lists of "good things", and his attention to his own physical health, though, suggest he might be an ISTP.  ES types are less effectively organized, I've found, even the most aggressive intellectual TJ ones.
Most humans in the spotlight, getting attention in mainstream media/business, are ES types.  Or ISTP's, since they are both the most chill and the most intellectually expressing IS types.  So if you want to find a bunch of other personality types, they might just not be there.

I already said my insight.  Folks who are negative (acting out of fear/defensiveness) are that way because they are suffering from a deficiency of some basic physical needs.  It's the fight/flight/freeze response of the sympathetic nervous system, as it reacts to some stressor in the environment.

It's not the apocalypse, because at the end of it we're all happier and healthier and more focused on living, instead of playing the rat race game.

I'm not arguing. I'm sharing my perspective with you.  I'm trying to offer you a way of looking at things that might shed some light onto how it all works, so that you're able to think outside the box.
My point is that Bitcoin is no different from any other currency in the sense that it's authoritarian and centralized.  Which isn't particularly useful for real life.  These systems are artificial and thus not robust enough to serve complex, ever changing, diverse living organisms in the long run.  They are too easily broken.  Which we've seen over and over again just in Bitcoin (forks).
To play the game, you need permission.  And when you don't get it, you will likely attack the system.  Healthy systems have to be decentralized, where no permission is necessary from anyone.  You just do you.  And the behavior of the whole system becomes unpredictable and emergent, creating something new and interesting out of individual, unique, parts.  Like how humans evolved out of bacteria.

Evolution programs a diverse range of approaches to life so that novel ways can be tried, as well as keeping around the best of the older ways.  So there are more conservative thinking types and more adventurous thinking types when it comes to how to organize ourselves.
To me Bitcoin is old fashion, actually, because I'm extremely adventurous when it comes to practical solutions to large problems.  So I even look at most of the pro-Bitcoin folks as being conservative.
This is just how genes and memes work, random mutation (innovation) plus natural selection (picking the stuff that works well with your own local needs), and things just kinda working out from there, in an emergent way.

That's what the centralized, mainstream banks already offer.  They say "We'll take care of all of you peasants.  We'll tell you who you can and can't trust and do business with."
That's fine if you want to do that.  But really, that's the entire opposite of what Bitcoin is for.  Bitcoin removes the central banks from the picture and lets us do business one on one, being our own bank.  Making our own decisions on who to trade with.  DIY money.

The only difference between Bitcoin and the "official" currencies is that the central authorities who control the rules of generation and allocation in Bitcoin are volunteer members of the public, rather than hired/appointed by the private companies/governments running them.
But they are equally centralized.  If they were decentralized, then there would be different rules for everyone generating/allocating the currencies.  I could make my own Bitcoin, or $, if these systems were decentralized.  But that's what we call currencies in general.  Anyone can make a currency (and I have) and make up the rules for how they are generated and allocated.  That's a decentralized system.  But *each* currency is, by definition, centralized, as the rules for how they are made and issued are controlled by some elite individual or group.
This is very important to understand, because any and all systems of centralized authority are subject to breakage, while decentralized systems are flexible and easily varied.  This is why we see attacks on Bitcoin, and it being broken many many times in its short lifespan (splitting into Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, etc.), while there is no attack on currencies as a whole.


That's what every centralized authority is.  That's literally what centralized means: many different individuals all agreeing to obey a single, core, set of rules.  If there is a set of rules that govern something, and everyone has to obey those rules, or they are kicked out of the system, then it's centralized.  If you don't agree with the majority in Bitcoin, you have to leave (which is what happened with Bitcoin Cash, et al.).

Diverse genes and gene expressions in individuals naturally form a whole system, with the diversity creating specialization so that all of the work that needs to get done gets done by someone, somewhere, simply by everyone being free.

It's a bottom-up, emergent system.  There is no authoritarian/centralized control, just freedom.

What you're probably excited about is the fact that Bitcoin is public and global, and that the rule-makers are more meritocratically placed, rather than being hired or elected by some private corporation or single country.

is way easier, also, if you really want to go with a centralized exchange that's the least intrusive/authoritarian.  There are very few rules there, and you can simply find people who want to trade things for Bitcoin there.

Those are all very non-hilarious suggestions.  They are all very logical.  Except for the last one.  It's not logical to call someone dumb.  Decisions are dumb, human brains are not.
Though some of those clearly need some clarification, as it seems like some folks are very confused about even the first one.  They ask how they are supposed to know what low is, compared to the future.  But you don't.  You compare it to the past.  If the exchange rate is lower now than at some point in the past, that's the time to buy.  Then only sell at a higher exchange rate.  That's just common sense, if your goal is to make a profit.  
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:48:11
Yep.  Though you didn't buy low.  You bought at an all time high (or very nearly).  So you're going to have to wait a lot longer.  Those who bought at the earlier crazy peak (around $1000 back in 2013) had to wait a few years to get back there.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:07:02
This is a good strategy, as long as you stop buying at an all time high.  It will come down again after that.  Nearly guaranteed.  Wait for the dip.
When it's at an all time high, that's the time to spend it!  
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:01:16
Here are the basic rules for Bitcoin:
1. Buy low, sell high.  (This means buy when it's lower than an all time high, and sell at a higher exchange rate than you bought at.  If you are aiming to make a profit.)
2. Do your own research!  Get all of the different opinions.  Look to understand the motivations of those making decisions (Satoshi, the developers, miners, node runners, and owners of Bitcoin) to see how their goals align with yours.
3. Only ever invest/gamble what you're comfortable losing, temporarily (while hodling) or permanently (if Bitcoin goes extinct).

It's also the most money-winning coin of all time.  All of those losers sold to the winners.  The holders are the winners, the fearful ones are the losers.  If you want to play the big gambling games of the world, you have to be confident, not panicky.

Bitcoin was designed to be peer-to-peer.  So instead of using middleman exchanges, find people you know and like to trade with.  It's not anonymous, but it's more respectful, and less risky than dealing with anonymous companies like the exchanges usually are.
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:53:46
Buy low, sell high.  (As in buy before or after an all time high, and sell higher than whatever you bought at, if you are ready to sell.)
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Bitcoin is a long term investment.  (HODL or spend and replace, until you can use it to do something life-changing for your friends/family/community/whatever.)
You seem to have missed those three most crucial guidelines of Bitcoin.  And somehow bought high, aren't hodling, and presumably invested more than you were happy not having.

Buy low, sell high.  It's not complicated.  Is the exchange rate lower today than it was at some point in the past?  OK.  You can buy.  If the answer is no, then don't buy.
Then sell when the exchange rate is higher.  That's all.
The point is to sell higher than you buy.  And to do that, it makes sense to not buy when the exchange rate is higher than it's ever been.
Another way to say this is: "Don't buy at an all time high.  And only sell when it's higher than when you bought it."
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:54:36
The simple thing is that Bitcoin as a game has a built in motivation to keep the energy expenses at a minimum.  The more a miner uses, the fewer monetary points they collect.
So they will want to be efficient no matter what their sources of electricity are.  And as fossil fuels become more and more expensive compared to essentially free sources like sun, wind, heat, human power, etc., those will be used more and more.
This is in stark contrast to, say, the marketing departments that con humans into buying cars, eating junk "food", and spending their lives serving corporate owners, instead of actually doing something awesome and fun with their lives (creating and exploring and sharing the coolest stuff in the universe).  Bitcoin does waste some energy, but it's programmed into the system to use as little as possible, while other elements of our society are programmed to waste as much as possible.
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:17:32
Because it's the worst of all worlds.  It's an overly complicated centralized exchange, like all the other ones, but it's not as easy to find or use, and has no big corporate-sounding backing that makes people at least sort of imagine that they won't get screwed.  And there's no one working to make it more welcoming to actual humans.

I'm talking about the yearly average.  I don't care about short term values or how many and how big the peaks and troughs are.  Bitcoin is an investment, not some fad.  So I just care about the overall pattern.  Is it growing, or not?  Yes, it's growing.
However, my math might indeed be off.  I have a sort of dyslexia for these kinds of numbers.  They are irrational to me much of the time.
I looked at the numbers you pointed out, and while I definitely didn't "make up" the average for 2013, it was clearly very wrong!  And you're right that I did miss the dividing bit on those other two years. (I was just reading off whatever the calculator said, and trying to do it on a moving bus that was making me nauseous while looking at the screen, so I wasn't paying as much attention as I would have liked.)  Thanks for pointing out the mess I made. 
I checked my math more thoroughly this time and think that these are correct now:
2011 .30 - 5.11 = 2.71 average  
2012 5.11 - 13.51 = 9.31 average  
2013 13.51 - 770.14 = 398.58 average  
2014 770.14 - 313.92 = 524.03 average  
2015 313.92 - 434.46 = 374.19 average  
2016 434.46 - 968.23 = 701.35 average  
2017 968.23 - 13,860.14 = 7414.19  
2018 13.860.14 - ? (3412 on December 13th) = 8636.07 average (at present)

Buy low means lower than the all time high.  Simple as that.  
And the average price has gone up every year except 2014 and 2015

2012 5.11 - 13.51 = 18.62 average  
2013 13.51 - 770.14 = 2121.14 average  
2014 770.14 - 313.92 = 1084.06 average  
2015 313.92 - 434.46 = 374.19 average  
2016 434.46 - 968.23 = 701.35 average

You can pretty safely trade at an all time high and buy the dips later on.  It might take a while though to get to those dips.  Like this is the lowest it's been for what?  A year and a half?   But once we've hit a high a second time, it's far less likely to come back to that point in a dip.

Also, the secret is that I use a more realistic math here.
Growth in natural systems (which adoption of an idea/approach in a population is), is exponential, not linear.  This means that, rather than the "-90%" that you are thinking the exchange rate has dropped (from the all time high, which is clearly a ridiculous extreme to compare things to from the start), is actually more like 40%.

Bitcoin isn't decentralized (it IS open source and public, though).  
But, yeah, I would totally make a new Bitcoin subreddit, except that every time I try to make a better, more free/open/welcoming/nurturing community than one that already exists on Reddit, but is controlled by authoritarian types, it goes nowhere.  That's because in Reddit, the most generic/obvious name for a subject is just where everyone defaults to.  There is no subject browsing, or categorization, function to help people find the best communities.  So we all have to settle for the mediocre-to-shitty ones that got to a good subject name first.

Democracy is rule by majority vote. You can do it directly, or with representation. It's still authoritarian/centralized, which is why it sucks, compared to a truly decentralized system where everyone is free to have their own, unique rules.
Bitcoin and other centralized/democratic systems are a dying breed, Bitcoin is just the last ditch effort to try to make these antiquated systems work, before they totally go extinct.
@_date: 2018-12-03 13:48:36
All individual currencies have to be centralized (control), by definition.  It wouldn't be a single currency if there was no central set of rules for generation and allocation (initially).
Centralization is why Bitcoin is so easily broken, as we see in all of the many forks where different factions disagree about the rules.
The terms used to describe what you're thinking of is public and democratic (or really more meritocratic, I think) combined with it being a network which is geographically distributed around the world.


That's because it's centralized.
Blockchain is also centralized (control), on it's own, since that's the whole point of the system: create a single consensual database record of all of the accounts.
If there is consent, aka. shared rules, then it's a centralized governance.
A decentralized system is one where everyone is free to have their own, unique rules.  As in human bodies, where all of the different species have their own genes as well as each cell has it's own gene expression (heart cells have different rules than brain cells which are different from liver cells, etc.).  Decentralization is bottom-up, chaotic, and unpredictable.  Blockchain and currencies alike are the polar opposite, looking for predictability and uniformity of behavior.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:23:25
It's not a requirement.  It's the purpose.  Using national currency is what anonymous or distant trades are for, while Bitcoin is designed to be used peer-to-peer, without a third party (banks) getting in the way.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:50:36
Not no rules.  But no shared rules.  Decentralized systems, like an animal's body, or art, are where everyone is free to do whatever they want, using their own rules, and the whole collective has emergent properties that none of the individuals could have accomplished independently.

But almost no one does it the way Satoshi intended: peer-to-peer.  Me to you.  You to your parents.  Your parents to their neighbors.  And so on.  Not through centralized exchanges, usually for-profit ones, no less.  With all kinds of application forms and legal permissions required.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:14:44
Yeah, it's taken me decades to understand this.  So if my cursory explanations here aren't helping you, that's probably because it's too new of an idea for someone to just get in a few paragraphs.
If the smaller scale system of how a human body works doesn't help you see how a larger system would work, then I don't know what else to offer you.  I am made up of diverse species (10,000 or so, from what I've seen, including two for homo sapiens), with each cell having it's own unique expression of those genes (heart cells have different programming than brain cells, for example, even though they have the same genetic code), and there is no centralized control.  Everyone is free to do what they were made to do, and everyone is taken care of naturally, because that's how evolution makes things.  Biology works because it's evolved to function well.
The same is true on all levels.  Do what you're made to do, and it all works out pretty darned well.  Not utopia.  But well.  And always improving, as evolution's simple random mutation and natural selection of approaches brings the best stuff into beings, and lets the worst stuff go extinct, or be kept to a minimum if it has any value at all.
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:01:48

Third.  Did you not read what they said.  They bought the first time it hit an exchange rate of $1000, and then it dipped to $200.  Then it hit $1000 again, years later.  And now it's dipped to $3000.  If it went to $1000 again, that would be the third dip to $1000.

The problem is that what you're talking about is artificial, caused by a fake game of competition.
Real, natural, healthy systems are collaborative, not competitive.  When living organisms are free, they naturally give as much as they receive.  They don't hoard, at least not for long, because hoarding makes you sicker, as it drains your energy trying to keep track of too many resources.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:09:15


It's more.  Because the majority are more in charge, than if there is some single leader or very small group making the decisions.

And the "market" is dominated by a handful of exchanges plus some whales.
The rules are centralized.  The system is democratic.  Bitcoin is the same as all other currencies, except that those in charge of making the rules don't have to be hired/elected, and can just show up.  So Bitcoin is a public corporation, essentially, and it's global, and open source.

Ok, lets refocus on a very obvious and simple part of your nature.  Your breath.  Breathe in, breathe out.  Does that seem scary to you to do?  To be free to take in the oxygen you need and then give away the carbon dioxide you don't?  
Or does it just feel *natural*?
Because that freedom to take in resources that your body needs, to function well, and then express itself, outputting the excess stuff it no longer needs, freely, is what nature does.
This is Communism, as Marx and Engles described it.
You can call breathing utopia, but you would be silly.
Now expand your sense of freedom to everything that your body wants to do.  Taking in good stuff, freely, and outputting new, different, stuff that your body made, freely.  That's all there is to a healthy ecosystem, as far as you're concerned.  The organization of it all is taken care of by evolution, which uses random mutation to make diverse approaches to problem solving so that all of the niche work gets done by someone, somewhere, and natural selection allows different individuals to find collaborators who fit well with them, so that there work gets done more easily.

I find debates to be like most sports, pointless and tiring.
But if you're interested in how a complex, free system works, the biology of our animal bodies is the way to go, as it's most studied system out there, and one of the longest lasting ones, too.
Specifically take a look at the new research on how the diverse species' genes (mostly bacteria, plus two human ones) all collaborate to form a whole body, and how all of the different genetic expressions help fill all the niche roles of the body, naturally, with no competition, only freedom.  (Except when there is an illness, which is caused by competition, and is only cured by removal of the offending competitor, and/or collaboration with it.)

I think it's you who's thinking in old fashioned ways.
Or you're just trolling and have no idea what I'm talking about.
It's true that most folks don't understand what a centralized system is, and think that anything that is open to volunteers and maybe is democratic is "decentralized" but it's not, since what defines a decentralized system is where the power to make the rules/governance/control is.  Is it in the individuals individually/independently, or is it in the collective as a whole?
A bottom-up, emergent, decentralized system is one where all of the individuals are making up and following their own, unique rules that others *don't* follow, while a centralized system is one where there are shared rules that everyone has to follow, or get kicked out of the system (like Bitcoin Cash folks did when they wanted to follow new rules).
Currencies as a whole is a decentralized system, as anyone can make up a currency and define the rules of it, without anyone else needing to follow those rules.  Each individual currency is a centralized system, by definition.  It's not "a" currency if it doesn't have a shared core set of rules for how it's generated and allocated (initially).

Bitcoin promotes competition, not collaboration.  Bitcoin is the authoritarian ruler forcing everyone to be haves or have nots, instead of working together to ensure that everyone is free to do what they really want to do (create and explore awesome stuff in the universe that improves life for someone somewhere).  Bitcoin is just as harmful as all other currencies, due to it's centralization of power/control.
Also, "selfish" is good for the world.  The more you focus on doing what you love, and being yourself, openly and honestly, the better off everyone else.  Because when you are focused on trying to pretend to be something you're not, and lying/deceiving others to make that happen, you harm not only yourself, but everyone else, as we become confused and have to work with bad information about you.  So when we want to help you, which we usually do, because we're social animals, we can't.

Firstly, that's outside of the discussion I was having, which was about the pretty testable fact that words can't actually hurt anyone (unless they allow them to, by choosing to interpret those words in a harmful way).  
Secondly, discrimination and legal interference and other situations of conflict, such as challenges to someone's freedom of expression (including speech), can happen for any and all reasons, with most of them being pretty irrational.  These days in the political area of life, almost everyone is a bully, trying to mess with someone else's ability to be who they want to be.  When you're angry, you aren't thinking rationally, and so you can easily make up excuses for attacking others, discriminating against them for all sorts of arbitrary and ridiculous reasons.

I think you mean private vs public controlled currency.  They are all centralized.  It's just that Bitcoin's control is by a group of volunteer developers, miners, and node runners, and *anyone* who wants to (and can figure out how to) play the game, which is the opposite of a private/government controlled currency.

The unnatural inequalities are the ones that make you and I and everyone else sick.

Your advice is common, and not at all based on any sort of deep understanding of the diverse range of life, as far as you've presented it.
Compare your advice to this, for example: 
Also, any time someone has an "anti" something stance, it has more to say about them than about the rest of reality.  Fear/defensiveness is a sign of a lack of high quality physical needs in those suffering from it.  It has little to do with science and understanding of the complexities of physics and how things flow in reality.
Which is why you're not able to actually help others (physically).  You're deficient yourself.  Which is why my goal in life is to help you and everyone else get those basic physical needs met, so you can be helpful to life.

Bitcoin is decreed by force.  I don't get to decide for myself how to generate and allocate it.  
Either I'm free to make up my own rules for how I use it, or I'm not.
In a healthy, free system, everyone is free to use whatever rules work for them, and others don't force their rules on them (or kick them out of the system).
But I get that this is a novel concept when you've only ever been taught authoritarian/centralized/linear systems.  Natural, free, decentralization seems like "chaos" and that seems scary, even though that's how everything in the universe that lasts is created.
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:39:28


Ah, so you do believe in supernatural forces governing life.  That's a sticking point.  I can't do anything with that belief.  If reality isn't following a decent set of rules, as in the laws of physics, and things can just arbitrarily (not randomly, but totally not predictable at all), then there's no point in studying reality, and that leads to nihilism.  No thanks.


Most atheists are religious, just with a different kind of authoritarian god.  Usually their favorite pop culture politicians/artists/techies.   (Can you say "Praise Elon!"?  Or maybe, more appropriate to this community "Praise Satoshi!"?)


No one.  They are the rules that have to exist because that's how matter and energy interact in reality.  We can describe those rules, to some extent, probably, as we attempt to do with physics.  But they aren't created by some supernatural, external force.  They just *are* because that's the only possible way for them to be. 
([Here's a map of the rules as I understand them]( with a simple pattern of division/random-mutation and recombination/natural-selection.  It starts at the birth of something, and moves down as the system evolves.  This applies to all systems.  Everything is in there somewhere.  All possible patterns of matter and energy (cyan and magenta).)


All zero-sum games (point scoring systems) are manipulated.  That's the only way they can function.  Someone has to control how the points are generated and allocated, at least initially.  That's authoritarian.  That's the opposite of freedom.  If you tried to have your body's cells work this way, you'd be dead, because 80% of your cells would be deficient of their needs.  Letting only 20% (or whatever fraction) be the elites, who get what they need to work plus what everyone else needs as well (hoarding, which is basically making oneself toxified, aka "full of shit"), would mean that most of your system fails.  That is a *dead parrot*.  Deceased.  Kaput.  No more.  He's not pining for the fjords.  He's pushing up the daisies.  Etc.


It's hard to see the things you're taught to ignore, especially if ignoring them is what you've been taught will allow you to survive in a deadly environment.
But again, go back to the breathing.  Inhale.  Exhale.  Freely.  Take in what you need to function well.  And give away whatever you have in excess.  And stop trying to repress yourself.

Life.  
Anything biological.  Like how your body (if you are human) has thousands of different species in it, and each cell has it's own gene expression, as well, yet they all somehow end up having the same shared goal of being healthy, thus, even without knowing how they do it, they create a healthy, thriving (hopefully) system.
Currencies in general are decentralized.  Anyone can make their own currency.  Anyone.  Make your own rules for how it's generated and allocated.  It's fun!  I did it once.

Not on the internet.  (Also, not in many parts of the world in meat-space.)
And I already explained how we can solve both problems at once here.  Individuals need to be free to both express themselves fully, AND be able to not have to be forced to read/listen to everyone else's expressions if they aren't feeling able to deal with them at the time.  This means a fully public internet, where there is no censorship between individuals, but also where individuals control the content they subscribe to (except for initial notifications of content offers from others).
This is BOTH private property AND "socialism" in the sense of everyone being equal.

Yeah, there is no logical pattern to generation naming/grouping.  That's because it's more of a media thing than a sociology thing.  But when I was a teenager in the 1980's and the term Generation X started to be popular, I heard that it ended at 1969, which is when I was born.  Though in researching it, the term was used in the 1950's even, to refer to teens then.  
The groups definitely overlap in mainstream media usage.  "Millennials" now can include anyone under 50 at this point, it seems.  
I use 20 year periods, and the whole X, Y, and Z pattern.

I'm not sure what you're talking about here.
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:41:21
I'm using the term in the mathematical sense.  It's either a linear system, where everyone is using the same set of rules, or it's a non-linear (chaotic) system where everyone is doing something different, and the whole only emerges, unpredictably, out of the mess.
The centrality of a central system is the rules.  Not who makes them.  Democracy is just as centralized as a monarchy.  Some individual or group defines the laws that everyone has to obey, or get kicked out of the system.  It doesn't matter how you decide those rules, as long as they are the same rules for everyone, it's a centralized government.
A decentralized government is like our animal bodies, with diverse species' genes and the different gene expressions of each cell all doing their own thing, with their own rules for behavior, but naturally having a whole system emerge out of the chaos.
Bitcoin and all other individual currencies have to be centralized, governance-wise, or they wouldn't be A currency.  Just like Bitcoin Cash is NOT Bitcoin.  They couldn't agree on the shared/central rules, so the system broke into two different centralized systems.
What Bitcoin IS is democratic (and somewhat meritocratic as well), and public and open source, which is different from most other currencies.  It's also volunteer run.  Or at least the developers and node runners are volunteers.  (The miners do get paid sometimes.)  And Bitcoin is globally distributed, physically.  But that's common for most large networks these days.  Even the US FED has locations in multiple areas in the US.


Um... There is no single Google HQ.  Google is a network of many different offices and server farms all over the world.  There's even a HQ about a mile from where I'm sitting, lurking in the middle of a bunch of other buildings so well that I never saw it for years.  Google has a centralized governance, though, just like Bitcoin, in that everyone who works for Google has to obey the same basic rules or get kicked out.  But Google is globally distributed in it's physical structure, just like Bitcoin.

We also need to wait for the tax season silliness to calm down, since it means folks shifting money around both to declare as many losses as possible (or as little gains as possible) and to get local/national currency to pay the taxes.

Because we're only at the very beginning of adoption.  And the wild west hasn't been explored well enough, and tamed enough, for the less adventurous to be ready to move in.
Plus, we still need to sort out how to actually make this peer-to-peer, so that we're not forcing folks to use middleman style exchanges, and instead support folks in trading with people they actually know and respect, personally.
A global, public (not private banks, and not government controlled), currency system is something that a large majority of humans want right now, and it's just a matter of us adventurous types ironing out the more lumpy challenges for joining the game.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:52:11
Just FYI, Bitcoin is a centralized institution.  It's just one that is open to the public and fairly transparent.  The elites making the rules about how the currency is made and allocated are still there with Bitcoin, but they aren't hired by some private corporation or government.  It's more of a meritocracy than a democracy or a lucky "who you know" sort of thing.

Wikipedia says:


But the graph they show shows that the birth rate started to plummet in 1958.
My own research shows that Generation X was first used in the 1940's to describe teenagers, but didn't catch on for a decade or more.  I see Gen X as being the 50's and 60's.  (Then 20 years of Gen Y, then Gen Z is the Millennials born in the 90's and 00's.)
But it's all pretty arbitrary.  In the real world there are no notable differences beyond individual years.

It's fun when you exchange the same amount of US$ every time you get Bitcoin, and see the amount you're getting go up and up and up.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:16:01
The problem is in using "gateways to Bitcoin" that aren't actual other individuals with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is supposed to be peer-to-peer.  We're doing it wrong when we set up middlemen systems that make it so that we don't know who we're making exchanges with.
We need to create a way to actually do transactions with people we already know, and want to exchange with personally.

That's what the banks have taught you.  They want you to distrust the people you already are friends with, to the point where you are actively afraid to do business with them directly.
If you feel that way, then just use "safe", convenient national currencies that are "secured" by corporations and big government.
Or, you know, just don't do business with Joe and Jim.

Public, yes.  Decentralized, no.
Bitcoin is, just like all other official currencies, governed by an elite group.  They decide how it's generated and allocated.  But, the real difference here is that the elites get there because they want to be and have the resources to do it, as compared to only being allowed in by invitation (as with a private corporate or government).
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:36:14
Here's the cheatsheet:
Bitcoin as a currency/idea is singular no matter what you're doing.  You can buy Bitcoin, or just be involved in working on it.
Bitcoin as also a unit of measurement, means that you can have 1 Bitcoin or 2 Bitcoins (or more).

Everything is balanced.  If you are double the normal growth at one point, you have to compensate with being half the normal growth at another point.  It's a wave.

While you are correct in saying that money is something we can all afford to lose, in a deeply scientific and philosophical sense, that's not how most humans who are looking to invest money are concerned with.
As a homeless woman, I understand that all of my money can go into Bitcoin and I'll be fine.  I've had no money many times before.  So I can afford to risk all of my money on Bitcoin.  Those who aren't comfortable being homeless (presumably because they've never been there), won't risk all their money on investing in Bitcoin, if they understand the simple "Don't risk more than you can afford to lose."

Getting some free tips with the ChangeTip system on Reddit years ago is what got me my first Bitcoin.  So, yeah.  Giving away small amounts is very healthy.  I've done it here and there, to folks who read my postings and such in various communities (not here) to get newbies interested.

The bosses of Bitcoin are everyone who decides what the rules are.  From Satoshi to the developers to the miners and node runners, and to a lesser extent the owners.
Why would it be necessary to name them to know that voting and top-down decision making is how the system works?
And the politics are the fact that there are disagreements about how to govern Bitcoin (generating and allocating Bitcoins).  As long as there is a disagreement, then there is politics.  Politics is how groups of individuals compete to get their ideas into the rules.

Pro tip: the word advice is the noun.  Advise is a verb.
And you were the one who asked for someone to teach you.  If you didn't want advice, then don't ask for it, maybe.  Though being in public, you're going to get advice no matter what you want.  Because we're human and we like to help others.

You absolutely do need permission to use Bitcoin's system.  It's heavily regulated by the developers and miners, and node runners, to some extent.
What it is, however, is public, so that as long as you *are* obeying the rules that others have set (starting with Satoshi) you can join, as opposed to needing to be hired/appointed by the existing governance.  Relatedly, Bitcoin's centralized rules are created through a direct democracy, instead of representative democracy or whatever.  Satoshi handed the control over to everyone who has the resources and interest to be part of the elite, so it's not a monarchy, at least.
But I agree that as long as it's voluntary, to use money, then that is indeed freedom/anarchy/punk.  But currently money is not especially voluntary for many humans, which is the core of the problem.

I'm not a dude.
And the problem is that the internet doesn't have a public space at all.  It's ALL private and those private spaces are owned by corporations.  Technically you can host your own website, if you pay a corporation for internet access, and if you pay for the website address.  But there is no actual public access for hosting your own content.  So you don't have free speech, period.
The goal is to allow everyone their own private space where they control the content they share, while allowing anyone and everyone to access it, freely.  That means that all corporations and individuals are free to express themselves, without interfering with anyone else's freedom.

Make sure that anyone you know who might be interested in buying some Bitcoin knows that you're happy to sell them some, at cost (for you).  Or in trade for something you can use.
As long as Bitcoin is dependent upon middleman exchanges, it's going to be too complicated for the general public to use.

We don't need to dream, they already exist, on a variety of scales.  They are natural systems, where everyone is free, and there is no score-keeping, zero-sum contest just to live.

If you are saying that the speaker who has been censored for saying something can change what they were saying and not be censored, then that's obvious.  That makes complete sense to me.
There are many different ways of speaking your mind, and doing it in a way that doesn't offend others is a talent, which will help you be less discriminated against.  I've learned that a bit over the years.  I'm a little more skilled in saying things that others are scared to hear so that they are less scared (and thus react with less anger/offensiveness/violence).
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:53:05
Every peak looks like that.
Normally, with a growing thing, it doesn't plateau until it reaches it's greatest potential (based on what it was designed to do).  Bitcoin was designed to be a global currency, and it's only just begun it's ability to serve that role.  So it's got a long way to grow.
Now what something is designed to do isn't a guarantee that it will be able to reach maturity, but stopping growth before something is mature means that it's killed before it's time.  That might happen to Bitcoin, so far it just keeps getting more love and attention and interest.

I personally don't believe you should exclude any of the four dimensions of brain function when making decisions.
I aim to model first, second, third, and fourth person dimensions (physical, emotional, intellectual, and philosophical) when trying to understand the patterns of the universe.  Though, obviously, I'm only human, and not a well cared for one (as is the norm in this broken society), so it's true that oftentimes I only am able to think in first or second person perspectives at once, and thus am indeed emotional thinking, with my aim to serve mine and your goals at the same time.
Which is why my primary work these days is using whatever resources I can get to create a community space where teachers, artists, and techies can use creative solutions to help every human and other Earthling the things they need to function at their peak.

They don't really understand how to run a community if they don't welcome diverse discussions, though, which their rules, and their actions, don't.  It's definitely harmful to Bitcoin, which is, itself, trying to get away from dictatorial/authoritarian rules and regulations.
I think the folks who effectively own this community aren't real Bitcoin fans, and just want to make a profit.  Which is fine for regular folks, but for those who have the power to censor others, it's quite harmful.

Did you read that first link I shared?  The value is how useful it is to life, as a whole, in helping life be more fit, in the long run.  So it's measured in usefulness in living organisms getting more of what they need to function well.
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:16:37
All living things naturally need to input (good) stuff and output (new, random) stuff.  That's just how the physics of organisms work.  We'll never stop needing to have resources flowing around.
We will, likely, stop trying to make that flow into a competitive point scoring game.  But for the time being, we do at least put some point values on a few of our outputs and inputs, so as long as we're keeping score, we're gonna use numbers that represent the overall percentage of the whole, which is how Bitcoin works.
Technically Bitcoin isn't deflationary (or inflationary), it's just we keep realizing that more and more of the planet's outputs are valuable, and so we give them a small fraction of the overall number of points in the system as a whole.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:22:26

We animals are just collections of genes.  No supernatural power allowing a human to do "any number of things" that the genes, and laws of physics, don't allow.  Unless you believe in supernatural powers, of course.


Why would I even bother to try to do that?  Conning people is religion.  I have no interest in being a preacher.  I'm simply pointing out the way evolution works.  It doesn't need me to con anyone into following my observations as gospel.  Evolution just does it's thing naturally.  Because it's just physics.

The weak hands plus the day traders, got out, and are either waiting to get back in, at a lower exchange rate, or gave up entirely, for the time being, and it dropped another thousand US$.

People don't need to understand Bitcoin, they need to find an easy way to get and use it.  Right now only the most determined and lucky folks can get into the game.  That's fine for the beginning stages of a game, but once the alpha testing is done, we're going to need to make the game super easy to join, if we want it to be popular.  We're not even in the beta testing stage yet.  It's not even really open to the public, essentially.  You have to be a pretty nerdy person to do the research needed to access it.  When it's no longer invite-only, anyone who hears about Bitcoin will be able to do a quick search for "How to buy Bitcoin" and find simple apps and (non-profit) websites that offer wallet services, which will show them how to send and receive Bitcoin from their friends/family and businesses, without exchanges being involved at all.

This isn't natural.  This is artificial.  It's manufactured idiocy.  It takes a whole lot of effort to make humans do such stupid things over and over again.  We're not born this way!

For anyone else making these graphs, I recommend starting them at the point where Bitcoin and whatever currency you're comparing it to are equal in value.  So with US money start it at 1₿ = $1.  This just makes the exponential graph more reasonable, compared to trying to pick a scale for the fractional values.

I think the problem is that the OP made Bitcoin gambling their hobby.

So, which is it, do you have too much money to feel safe being open about yourself, or don't you?  If you have too much money, then you could afford "security" while being open about yourself.  If not, then you don't have to worry, as you suggest, because no one will care about you.

Except that real punks don't use money.  Money is an authoritarian system in and of itself.  It makes those with more money more powerful.  Which just isn't cool.

Yeah, it's just the mods who are kinda messed up here.
The rest of us know that the exchange rate with other currencies is important to understanding how the whole system is working.

If you were well informed, and had been successful in investing in Bitcoin, you might be someone who had something useful to say about it, but you're clearly not either, so, you're really just a lonely person looking for attention any way you can get it, or you're shilling for some other competing currency.

There were several predictions I saw that said $3000 was the bottom.  And I did a few little experiments myself.  The most conservative one was here:

"Eating" a dick is a euphemism for giving a guy oral sex.  He's saying that instead of giving himself oral sex, he's going to hire some poor, desperate women to do it for him, for the rest of his life.  Presumably because even if Bitcoin doesn't get to an exchange rate of 1 million US dollars for one Bitcoin by 2020, he's still going to be crazy rich, because Bitcoin is still going to be very valuable.

If you are using a credit card with mainstream money, then there is a fee.  For the receiver, at least.  If you are transferring from person to person, then you're probably going through Paypal or something, where there is also, usually a fee.  Usually a percentage.

The "knowledge" doesn't come from the debate, it comes despite the debate.  Debate is structured competition of information, rather than collaboration of information, which is my goal.  I want to get all of the different perspectives, so that I can make a multidimensional model of what reality is like.  ["Opposing" views are all equally important]( as long as they are honest.
If I seem to be "ignoring" things, it's because I've already added those perspectives to my model of reality, and want to add a different perspective to what you are describing, so that you can see what I, and others, see *as well as* what you see.


That's not the purpose of conversation, as I see it.  Collecting data is the job of whomever wants to explore a topic for themselves.  You have to do your own research to make your own decisions.  At least if you're not looking for a preacher, but are instead interested in creating objective science models of reality.
Plus I don't think we're ready to stop using money right now.  But we are definitely evolving away from it, because it's competitive, zero-sum, centralized, artificial tactics are harmful to life, compared to a natural/decentralized approach which allows freedom and collaboration for a positive-sum (creative) outcome.  The money game is the dinosaurs of memes.  The freedom game is the small furry mammals of memes.


You're contradicting yourself here!  Bitcoin forks are Bitcoin forks.  There was one Bitcoin, and then there were two different ones.  It doesn't matter what you call them, they are all the single centralized system breaking because people aren't free to do what they want.  There is no "Bitcoin" anymore, in reality, as it keeps splitting up into many different currencies.  That's because life only works when it's decentralized.  Folks try to force Bitcoin into a centralized structure, but nature has no tolerance for that in the long term.  Entropy hates simple, predictable, boring, inflexible, oversized things.


You ignored what I actually wrote.
I said:


Obviously Bitcoin is different *in other senses*.  Which is why I'm here.

Individuals don't have to be smart to serve evolution.  They just have to do what they love doing, instead of repressing their natural goals for creating, exploring, and sharing the most awesome stuff in life.

The general thing are the only things that matter in the long run.
Specific things change constantly, and are unmemorable when looking back at your life when you're nearing the end.  The only truly important things to humans turn out to be improving the world in some meaningful way for those we love, and in learning and/or creating something cool.
You could be a prisoner of war, a king, a farmer, or an astronaut and still have a meaningful life, if you've helped those you care about and learned or created something that you find cool.

You mean in the universe.
This is how our brains work.  We look at the patterns and make predictions.  That's the only way to make decisions.
What's your prediction?
Also, I don't think this is what's likely to happen.  I'm just sharing a very basic prediction.

Did it ever occur to you that people who are using logarithmic charts might have sex with one another?
Also, in the schools I went to, the most popular students were the ones who were the ones who tended to get the best grades and took the most challenging classes.  Including math.  Maybe that's just because I went to school in New England, which is a more intellectual sort of part of the world, but, really, the "smarter" you were, the more attractive you tended to be seen as.

The meaning of words is up to you.  There is no objective meaning.  You choose to interpret things as being unpleasant, pleasant, or neutral, depending on the context that you imagine things being said in.
I can say "I love the way you're doing that." and you can take it to be a compliment, an insult, or just simple information.  And this happens regardless of what actually mean.  Your interpretation is all that matters to you.  And how you decide to take it will affect your emotions.
(This is why sarcasm is something that many folks on the Autism end of the brain type range don't understand, for example.)

You have to look at those cultures using acid and similar chemical attacks in *other* countries though.  As in the case of the attacks with the Salisbury Novichok poisoning in the UK.  
The chemicals in the face is, I guess, done in the countries that do a lot of industrial factory sort of processing of stuff where these toxic and corrosive waste products are just lying around free for the taking.
Whereas the weird poisonings are for the more elite Russian spy agency types who can get the weirder compounds and smuggle them into other countries.

So are you just making stuff up here, so that you can say what you really want to say?  Or are you honestly confused about what I'm saying?
Because I very clearly said that everyone gets their own private space on the internet, when we're actually solving the problem of censorship (not having freedom of expression on the internet).  AND those private content sharing spaces are also publicly accessible to anyone, freely.  
That's not true, because email isn't a free public service.  You have to get permission from some corporation or service to get an email address.  You can set up your own server, but, as I already said, you need to pay for the address, and you need to pay for internet access.  That's not free.  That's discriminatory.

That's why he's the same.  If you're making enemies, it's because you're trying to tell other people what they can and can't do.  You're trying to centralize power.  That's the entire problem with politics, it aims to control others, rather than nurturing them and helping them be free.
