100% of 2k is 2k
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:33:57
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:20:46
Its not. But its a 100% increase.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:38:10
If you invest at 2k and it’s now worth 4K that is a 100% increase. There is no 200% involved anywhere
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:40:23
Gold literally is useful though....

Until I see screenshots of their pending bch transaction I'm calling bs. They most likely fucked up. Anyways btc has gone down so they probably made money off the sell if he just buys back.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:34
There is no way this isnt getting pumped and dumped. I am holding through it but this is just insanity.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:08:21
wow I came her to say dont skimp on the fee but are you aware you have paid 99usd for that transaction.

How much?

I wish someone wrote a little very easy to understand spiel that covered all the basics so someone like me could rattle it off.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:25:14
It could. It could also hit $1. As it could hit $14000. It could even hit $30000, or $2000.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:17:28
How is this fud? This genuinely happened to me. Btc is 80% of my holdings.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:14:06
You are correct. I am not one of the 149 other people following him rofl. This thread and his twitter post is dumb without proof.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:43:00
I mean you can but then you leave a paper trail and the tax man can know how much to tax you. If you never cash out they can never know how much is in your wallet, unless laws changes.

Kinda hostile for a dude just wanting some open discussion. You are not helping either.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:32:36
I am holding. You specifically said don't buy in now but it's going to go up roughly 80-90% before it dips. If this is your thinking you should definitely get in now. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:18:25
Wow your post history is embarrassing. All you do is spread FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:25:36
Yes, Honestly if I told some of my family members that $500 would get them 0.03BTC they would laugh at me. It is just a psychological barrier for them. Bigger number is more.

@_date: 2017-12-03 14:27:58
I mean if you think 1 coin could set you up why wouldn't you buy 2 if you had the funds with that line of thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:47:02
This is not my transaction. I am not an idiot like this dude. I have a fair chunk of my networth in crypto and BTC mainly, I have no reason to spread FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:50:37
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:29
Yeh I am not scared of a dip. It is very tempting to try sell high buy low but very risky aswell.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:16:46
It is not even close to mainstream yet. Not by a long shot. If Bitcoin does what it says it will do and basically become a separate currency that is actually usable in many places the current price of Bitcoin is going to pale in comparison to the price in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:11:56
How did you go?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:05:01

Formatted those those can read it. A little tip, you are telling people it is safer to use your referral link but you cannot press enter twice before a new dot point, not the best look.


























@_date: 2017-12-03 09:43:46
Yeh thats sort of my question. Is there room for Bitcoins transfer process to get better as tech gets better. I wasn't sure whether it was possible or not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:35:32
Wow crazy timing. did you do anything?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:21
Pretty sure its a a glitch.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:20:21
Na 1 bit is current 2c AUD. That is a terrible unit to use. I dont think BTC is any better either. Until BTC stabilises we are just going to have to deal with it being in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:27:06
Not to burst your bubble but if you put in $800 at 6k it would only be worth about $1,400 ish now. Even if bitcoin hit 100k (roughly 10x its current value) you would only have $14,000. Hopefully you have other plans to help then out besides that $800 if they need it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:21:54
Sounds pretty guilty to me.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:00:14
Yes they do. I was saying with your theory of bitcoin only being for smart people no one would get in. I think you are wrong. Bitcoin is for most people.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:30:18
Rofl this is just a referral link post. Trash 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:01:53

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:47

I am panicking a bit because fees are so high and I have been waiting for a confirmation for 30 hours now. The fee was roughly 30usd. I hate BCH, and would never buy it. BTC has some work to do to fix this shit or its going down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:07:00
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:37:39
Because MERICA
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:55:30
Yep and if you select that fee you will be waiting probably days to a week for it to confirm
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:23:04
Go on then.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:11:16
No shit Sherlock.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:43:04
I wouldnt not xfer until you get a couple hundred at least. The fees will kill you otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:21
It is very hard yes, but that isnt to say selling at one point and rebuying at another wasnt the best move.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:11:15
Well I am not sure why or if it's legal. Maybe you sign something when you open a bank account that they reserve the right to not give you your money for certain purposes or something. I literally have no idea, I have just read some people saying that they have ha these encounters today.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:19:26
if you believe the price will go up then entry point right now is irrelevant. However $15 isnt going to get you anywhere anytime soon. Even if BTC is wroth 200k a coin in the future you would have about $150-$200.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:15:49
Why? Who says you cannot buy back in. You saying selling is always bad is extremely naive.

@_date: 2017-12-03 09:36:58
I am merely going off what someone else in that thread stated they were going to have to pay. I assume he had higher fees because he was using an online wallet or something.
Afaik the less fees the longer the transaction takes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:57:03
Ok you can. I don't need you to believe I'm straight, I couldn't care less. This dude however wants us to believe coinbase sold the wrong coin when it is far more likely that the user just selected the wrong coin to sell. Show us proof before the witch hunt.

Why would they just sit in backstock? Why wouldn't they just put them to use themselves? Are you laying out an initial fee to help them buy the equipment and then you are getting 85% and they take 15%?
Can you explain exactly what investment you put in and what you see out of it in terms of per day/week/month.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:19:16
Fuck yea I love the JRE

it works. I did 8 hours last night and got $2 roughly
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:17:11
Yeh 10% is not a bargain. BTC can also drop 10% in a day.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:57:40
I kind of agree. There is no way my dad is ever going to get involved in BTC when he finds out he is only going to buy 0.05BTC or something. Us humans are so used to using numbers above 1 that I think it will be very hard to convert many people.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:40:37
If you never declare your BTC Wallet they can never know :wink:
You also cant cash out into a bank though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:54:35
If you are sending 10k it snot so bad but yes I agree it is pointless to transfer anything less than 2k right now imo.

Im hodling anyway. I just wanna see that number one time before bed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:30

Wow. This is out of control. Too think I was umming and ahhing over whether to get in at 10k usd. So glad I did.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:54:38
.675 is still WAAAAAY less than the total $1100 they could be making themselves. 
Simple Question. Why would they not just make the $1157.05 themselves? 
Why are they splitting the pie when they could eat the whole thing and at the same time not have the hassle of running a business such as cloud mining? It straight up does not make sense from any standpoint. Either you are missing some crucial piece of info which makes it valid and since you haven't told me that info I cant understand it or it is a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:35:26
Ok, thanks for the reply. Can you explain to me in the simplest of terms (think of me as a 10 year old) why a company who has this hardware already would sell you their mining power/time for 1 year off only $120 when they can clear that much in 60 days themselves?
One of four things are happening here.
1. You are being ripped off, there is fees or something you dont know about or your projected daily income will drop or something in the near future due to the difficulty getting higher and the same hashing power that is currently getting you $2.7 a day will start netting you far far less.
2. They are basically a ponzi scheme and when they get big enough they will take everyone's money and run.
3. You are actually working for that company and using reddit to advertise and giving fake figures to lure more people in.
4. They are a company who cannot do math and are giving away free money.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:27:05
Then you hate 99.9% of bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:21:32

@_date: 2017-12-02 10:50:05
you realise buying into a stock at $10000 and it going to $20000 is the same as a stock going from $0.001 to $0.002 right? Do you know how percentages work?
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:32:35
Dark mode or bust. Seriously
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:56:20
I mean you could say the same thing about those that got in years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:02:19
Ok dude let me break this down for you.
What you are saying is happening. I will assume for simplicity sake that you get a constant $2.70 a day for the entire year.
You pay $120, they give you $2.70 a day back in BTC.
2.78 * 365 = 985.5
This means that you are making a profit of $865.5 a year from this at this rate.
Their 15% is ((2.70/0.85) - 2.7) = $0.47 per day ($3.17 total mined per day)
0.47 * 365 = $171.55
They are making 120 +  171.55 = $291.55 for that year.
They could be making $3.17 * 365 = $1157.05 a year
They are also covering the cost of getting the equipment in the first place, but we don't even need to go into that to see how ridiculous this is.
So tell me why on earth they would choose to earn $291 a year compared to $1157 when they already own the equipment and have the set up ready to go. It literally makes ZERO sense. Am I missing something obvious? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:05:31
Just get a personal loan or something. If you have a job they will approve most the time.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:23:46

@_date: 2017-12-02 01:12:37

@_date: 2017-12-03 14:44:34

@_date: 2017-12-27 05:03:09
Could you cancel the transaction after that point though?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:23:44
How is his trolling? Because it goes against the narative that btc is the best thing ever? Right now it's not. I wish it was though because it's 80% of my portfolio. I'm just worried about it fucking up because it's going from exchange to exchange and not from my personal wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:35:57
If bitcoin hits 1 million youll have roughly $5000. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:22:46
Implying if it just sticks at 16k and doesnt move for a month that over 50% of BTC holders are not just going to bail. Most are in it to get rich quick and couldnt give two shits about it being a currency in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:54
No it didnt.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:34
Eh you never know. It could of went back to 14k and stayed there. I am holding but unless you got the guts to day trade, dont talk shit. You probably have like $30 worth of BTc anyway.
Edit: its at 15k now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:12
Because people are human and have emotions. Some people probably put their only $500 savings in and suddenly its worth $1000 in a week. Sometimes that is more money than they have seen at once. It is exciting and scary all at once.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:00:01
Fuck you.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:34:54
I don't get it. Why wouldn't they just mine themselves? Why even let you in at all. It makes no sense, and must be a scam.
If I had a machine that could make $100 a day, why would I ever rent it out and make less than that. It literally makes zero sense.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:30
Not saying this dude is not correct (I am not sure) but read the docs and do more research before just deleting your wallet because someone on the internet told you.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:27:32
hmm are you sure? My understanding is that they borrowed those BTC and sold at the current price and bought back during the contract. No one has to take the opposing position as far as I know, A broker / exchange just has to be willing to lend them the stock/Bitcoin for a duration.
The money they lose would just basically go back into the market when they buy the BTC back. The  broker / Exchange would also take a cut or flat fee for facilitating the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:20:03

Slightly harder to use. And by slightly I mean if you can't figure it out maybe you deserve to pay the fees. It is super easy.

No it certainly is not. If you sold at 19k and bought back in at 15k you saved yourself some serious coin. This is just one circumstance, where selling in winning.

How could this happen if 2FA was on.
Either someone's is a mad hacker and rekt you specifically (unlikely). Coinbase has a serious security flaw and shit is about to hit the fan (possible). You are full of shit and either trying to lower the value of btc (lol) or give coinbase a bad name (likely).
Your account is 4 years old with 2 posts 4 years ago and this is your first post in 4 years, just out of the blue. Most likely this reddit account was hacked to give the impression it isn't a new account.

Dude, you just avoided the simple question every single time I asked it. That is not intellectual conversation. It is clear you just want referral hits now. You are the one trying to pass something off as something it isnt.
