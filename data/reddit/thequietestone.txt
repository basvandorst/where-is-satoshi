In a peer to peer network like bitcoin you only need one server that is connected to a number of other nodes acting as relays for your dodgy transactions.
The OP is correct, this is a DoS, not a DDoS.

Ex slashdot junkie (&lt;75k uid) here.
Slashdot has morphed into a cutesy surface news and discussion site. Their definition of "nerd" isn't programmer or tech nerd. It's just nerd now.
They miss out on stuff that used to be considered interesting and important - things I get far better by following the appropriate sub-reddits here (like I mean, how did they miss out on reporting the Mill CPU stuff??
Shed a tear, leave it in your bookmarks for a bit, then remove it when you realise you've not visited it for over 3 months.

Ok fair enough, I didn't realise that such a term existed for exploiting the imbalance in server and client processing needs.
After further reading I've come to the conclusion that it's an unfortunate choice of acronym given the better known and more widely used choice of DDoS to mean distributed - as in using network nodes to overwhelm at the request level.
You work in IT with these things and failed to point out the differentiation - a rather important one.

I guess I just find it difficult to believe people are that happy to have some unknown third party code running on their personal devices. At a guess it's because they're unaware of the issues.
For example, if you asked people if they would be happy to access their bank details through a piece of randomly downloaded software off the internet they'd be cautious. And rightly so. Yet jailbreaks are kosher?

If you're uncertain that they were patched at the time you did a login - once they _are_ patched log back in and change your password (and two factor seed, if you're using one - you should be).
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:46:02
We're on a forum about virtual currencies and you are advocating running unchecked software from unknown people on someones personal device?
Who checks that the source code for jailbreaks is not malicious?

Where do you buy your coins at market rate in the U.K.?

Hmm, looks a bit "JSON" objecty.
Reason I mention this is that I don't think the order of key/value pairs in a JSON object is fixed. It might be in the electrum wallet (if their serialiser always outputs it first), or it might be a random key (instead of addr_history being first).
Good job, btw!

You never know if it is too late. If it's a large enough amount of coin, consider doing this.

BitcoinQT under Mav. OSX expects:
~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/blocks
~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/chainstate
The permissions are as follows for me:
    -rw-------    1 man  staff        0 18 Dec 21:13 db.log
    -rw-------    1 man  staff        0 18 Dec 21:13 .lock
    -rw-r--r--@   1 man  staff     6148 18 Dec 21:37 .DS_Store
    drwx------+  46 man  staff     1564 20 Feb 11:59 ..
    drwx------  246 man  staff     8364  3 Mar 11:35 blocks
    -rw-------    1 man  staff  1018078  3 Mar 12:58 peers.dat
    drwx------  197 man  staff     6698  3 Mar 12:58 chainstate
    -rw-------    1 man  staff   118784  3 Mar 12:58 wallet.dat
    -rw-------    1 man  staff  5181126  3 Mar 12:58 debug.log
    drwxr-xr-x   10 man  staff      340  3 Mar 12:58 .
Did you try running BitcoinQT a bit and getting it to start to sync? That should create the necessary directory structure above after which you can stop the app and copy over the blocks and chainstate directories.

DDoS - the first D stands for _distributed_, not dynamic.

Run the app, then run "Activity Monitor" and select the process in the CPU list.
Then click on the "i" information button and "Open Files and Ports" - this should tell you where it is opening those files.

It must be pretty difficult without a channel, too.
You probably should link + mention what your channel does, what it intends to do.
As it stands, this is just pleading for funds.....

I don't see anywhere in the NDA or the seller setup page where it talks about their code logging into someones internet banking.
I do see a PHP signing script for accepting trades, but nothing explicitly about internet banking sign in.
Am I missing something?

I've used bittylicious with success. They give the impression they work as a escrow style purchase/sell mechanism.
UK HMRC's MLR scheme registered and I've checked out their company information - all looks good.
I can only give my point of view as a purchaser - not sold any through it yet.
They were quick and pleasant to deal with in support too.
I should mention the prices are set by the sellers, not from a particular market.

I'd love to know if he has told his Bank he is selling BTC - and which Bank it is, and what their response (if he's told them) is/was.
Is he sole-trader declared or a UK LLC?
As far as I can tell we're still missing a proper UK exchange following appropriate laws and with the blessing of a real corporate bank account behind them. Would be interesting to know if he's got any headway against that wind.

Thanks for the pointer, very disturbing.
Wow, that is opening themselves up to a world of pain. Can't imagine that will carry on for much longer.
Why do all bitcoin related places seem to be run by two-bit-tommys (PHP, again, no idea of inappropriate practices, again).

Note: This is assuming that the electrum wallet file has some "magic" that you can use to find the start of it....
First thing - take an image of the drive onto a larger drive using "dd" under OSX/linux or some other tool.
Note - you need the _whole_ device image, not the files on there or the partitions.
Next, find someone who knows how to scan it looking for some magic key that indicates it might be the start of an electrum wallet. Then step through the candidates hoping that one of them is the actual wallet.
If you don't have the knowledge of how to do this but the coins are worth enough to you look into getting a local expert to do it for you.

It's personal taste and I'm English so I also browse [The Register]( and [The Inquirer]( but they're much more tabloid than content.
I've started using newsgroups again for the subjects I want to discuss (dsp, audio, linux) as the noise to content ratio there has got significantly better since everyone started using twatter and faeces book.
Sad really, I miss having the proper tech discussions on /. - something you don't really tend to get here on Reddit. People tend to drive by post rather than strike up a convo.
Cheery pip.
