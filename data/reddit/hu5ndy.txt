This is only half correct.  Navy Seals very rarely work under cover, and nothing about their identity or belonging to the Navy Seals is secret or privileged information. 
However, their missions are typically secret, for obvious reasons.

First of all, almost all of the top tech companies were founded by coders: 
- Google (Larry Page and Sergei Brin).  Google was also run by a coder for most of its history (Eric Schmidt, who developed a very well-known piece of software known as lex before going into management).
- Facebook.  Zuckerburg built most of the original version of Facebook himself and still codes from time to time.
- Amazon (Bezos was a computer science major)
- Microsoft, founded by programmer Bill Gates and currently run by a code (Nadella has master's in computer science).
- Oracle (Larry Ellison programmed the original database himself).
The list goes on and on, but just wanted to point out that it's actually somewhat rare for tech companies, which increasingly drive our economy, to be run by non-programmers.
Also, some of the most creative people I've known have been programmers.  Satoshi showed remarkable creativity in developing Bitcoin, combining disparate aspects of cryptography and economics into a single system.  Pretty imaginative, if you ask me.  And several of the core developers exhibit similar levels of imagination (most notably Greg Maxwell and Peter Todd, in my opinion, and ironically).
You make some good points, but seem to be under a misconception about developers.  Yes, the typical Java-bound corporate developer has usually had the imagination beaten out of them, but that's but a very small part of the software developer world.

I'm not going to yell about cex.io but I would like to ask you a question.  In a week when Bitcoin has seen its biggest adoption ever (expedia) on the heels on a huge company adoption (dish network), the price is falling.
What do you think that is?
Whether its because GHash/cex.io are actually a threat, or people are just perceiving them to be so, the end result is the same.  Loss of confidence and drop in price.
And if you have plenty of Bitcoins in cold storage, that should concern you.

I get where you're coming from, and your solution sounds reasonable.  However, I think crypto in the browser *may* have a future.  All it will take is a group of Bitcoin/crypto projects to come together and come up with a standard bootstrapping method for secure loading of web apps.
In Chrome, this could take the form of an open source Chrome app that checks the hash of of the top node of a merkel tree of web app file hashes against the same hash and its PGP signature stored elsewhere.  The user would do something like keep the public key and hash as a DNS TEXT entry, or maybe something using DNSSEC or DNSCurve.  It somehow would have to be pinned to the domain name.
Obviously, I'm just pulling this out of my ass and we'd need an actual cryptographer to help design a system and audit things (I can think of several in our community who probably would help out). 
But I think it's doable.
Another big advance coming out of browsers right now is the availability of a CSPRNG in most modern browsers, and the soon-to-be WebCrypto standard.
Browser security is a hard question, but I think ultimately it's doable.
Ultimately, the threat model you're proposing (forced surreptitious insertion of JS malware by the domain owner) can be addressed by a proper packaging system that includes signed releases.

This isn't as hard as everyone is making it out to be.  If you're just talking about a small percent of your total net worth, then there are numerous easy options available to you:
1.  Run electrum with a secure password.  Record your passphrase (seed) and keep it somewhere safe (safe deposit box).  Fast and done.
2. Open a blockchain.info account.  You're still in control of your private key, but they help with usability.  Just make sure you don't associate your insecure e-mail with the account, and be sure to use 2-factor authentication using SMS or Google Authenticator (both easy options).  Done.
3.  Use Bitcoin-qt with a secure password.  Done.  Takes up significant computer resources, however (memory, bandwidth, and CPU).  Done and fairly secure.  However, this is probably the least secure of the three I list simply because of how much malware targets the reference Bitcoin client.
If you are storing more than a fraction of your net worth, like a significant amount of savings, then at this point your options are more limited.  For this, you need to learn the basics of Linux, how to securely make an offline paper wallet, etc.  But if you're not storing more than a week or two of salary, then the three options I mentioned above are plenty secure.  I mean, you don't buy a $5000 alarm system for an Ford Escort, right?
Edit: Added "seed" in parentheses for the sake of readers who don't understand what I meant by passphrase.

If you really, really, really know what you're doing, you can send someone the private key to an address with *exactly* the number of Bitcoins you want to send on it, via another channel like e-mail.  
But really, you should be an expert to do this, since there are a lot of ways to shoot yourself in the foot.  Here's just a few of them:
1.  You may have more coins on that address that you realize, and once you give up the private key, they're no longer yours unless the recipient gives them back voluntarily.
2.  You *must* delete the Bitcoin address use to do this, since otherwise you might later accidentally use it again, and as soon as you do the person you send the private key can swipe them from you.
3.  The person you send it to may make the same mistake as (2), leaving him/her with the same vulnerability (they would need to sweep the address to another address under their control and then delete the key you sent them to avoid that mistake).

What kind of support do you want?  I thought it was pretty clear that when suggesting to avoid storing large balances on mobile phones, I was offering you my opinion, which is based on participating in the Bitcoin world as a user and developer since early 2011.
And yes, it's probably a bad idea to root your phone if you're going to store Bitcoins on it.  I only pointed out that this would be one sure way one could disable automatic updates.
And what other claim did I make that was "not necessarily true"?  I made three statements: 1 was agreeing with  you 100%, 1 was pointing out that it's not possible for devs to push out unwanted updates on most platforms, and 1 was  offering a caveat about storing large balances on secure desktop computers or paper wallets.
Btw, that last one is nothing more than my opinion, but it's also not at all a controversial statement.

If you look at Peter's ideological background compared to Gavin's, you'll see that Peter is probably much more philosophically inclined toward decentralized solutions.
By the way, this isn't necessarily a critique of Gavin.  In fact, he's just the sort of engineer's engineer that Bitcoin's code needed.
But he's not the political leader Bitcoin needs, particularly at the moment.
As for Andreas, I have no idea.  I think his head may be a bit in the sand, which is a shame given his unique influence on the Bitcoin community.
People say that it's only newcomers who care about GHash, but they're wrong, and am glad Peter has come out with his sale.  Early Bitcoiners were so concerned about centralization that several early pools voluntarily cut off new users at a MUCH lower percentage than 50%.  I thought that cultural emphasis on decentralization would remain, but I was wrong.
For what it's worth, I'm a long-time Bitcoiner -- since early 2011 -- with a tiny bit of code in the core Bitcoin project and significant participation in other projects involving the Bitcoin protocol.  And my faith has been greatly shaken over the past few months of mining centralization.

Java got that reputation from the 1990s, when it *was* slow.  Since then, a huge amount of progress has been made on Java's just-in-time compiler, and it's fairly competitive with C when doing long-running tasks.  Probably more in line with Go than C, but still pretty fast.

Agree 100%.  Exchanges should:

I looked very closely at doing this.  I've even built most of the server-end for this (and open sourced a small part of my resulting work[1]).  It turns out that was the easy part.  The hard part was what normally is the trivial part: writing plugins.
It turns out, the restaurant POS software business is a very closed business.  The handful of companies that dominate the POS business not only charge their customers thousands for their software, they charge additional *hundreds and even thousands* for the ability to run plugins or add-ons.  So I knew I could pore over their poorly-documented plugin APIs and write plugins, by I didn't think I could sell their customers on buying ~$500 plugin-licenses in addition to whatever I would charge just to run a Bitcoin plugin for the pos system.
There are a few ways around this, but it required more time and effort I could afford to invest at that point.
1. 
EDIT: If you Google all this and come up with the idea of using Subtle Data, sadly they seem to be winding down operations, I'm guessing in the face of threats of lawsuits from the major POS companies.  However, I see now is another challenger that could bring hope to this kind integration: a company called Clover that's developing an open POS system in collaboration with a major payment processor.  I'll keep my eyes open.

I'll just post Cex.io/GHash.io's official statement here and let readers decide.  I was actually trying to state that as fairly as I could toward Cex.io -- a less charitable view would be that they did it themselves and this is all smokescreen.  I mean, a 3-day downtime when they were already minting somewhere around 800-1000 BTC a day?
But here's their statement:
CEX.IO official statement:
In October the development of the “GHash.IO” project was transferred to the CEX.IO development team.
The team worked hard to completely rewrite the whole GHash.IO engine, as well as perform other stability and responsiveness improvements, which you all may have noticed. We have also removed the 3% fee and released merged-mining alt coins to the miners.
We would like to state that CEX.IO does not have any affiliation with the double-spending attack. As a part of the bitcoin community we condemn such actions, which harm the bitcoin network.
We have conducted an internal investigation and can confirm, that from the 25th to 27th of September, the GHash.IO pool was mining on the address: 1MA7CKbWMyKdPkmsbnwmfeLh1hYy5A3gy8 to which we do not have any access or connection.
However, the rewards for mined blocks on the above mentioned address were paid out from the GHash.IO wallet as per usual.
Following further investigation and server log analysis we have noticed that several private keys were imported to the GHash.IO wallet within that time period. (exact date could not be determined). This was done to conceal the missing bitcoins, since there was no direct deposit transaction.
We haven’t found any signs of the system being compromised, but we believe that the attack was made from within the former development team.
At the moment CEX.IO LTD is the lawful owner of the CEX.IO and GHash.IO projects as well as their domains.
Our team at CEX.IO LTD. will do everything possible to prevent pool capacity manipulation in the future.
We understand the communities’ concern about the misconduct of such great computing power at our pool (since recently we have become the  pool), and we will gladly take into consideration any comments or suggestions to improve the pool’s security and overall quality of service.
EDIT: Ok, no bold now.  Just the statement that Cex.io released.

You need to ask yourself a vital question: do you want to contribute *to* Bitcoin and other altcoins, or do you want to build projects that *use* Bitcoin and/or other alcoins?
If it's the first, then you'll have to learn C++.  Almost all coins of the hundreds of coins listed on coinmarketcap primarily run on C++ (except 1 in Java and 1 in Python, and the Python one runs on top of Bitcoin).  
Unfortunately, C++ is a hard language to learn, so you should probably start with a good learning language like Python, Ruby, or Lisp.  C would be another good learning language, and some of what you learn in C will be useful in C++ (but make no mistake: C and C++ are 2 different languages).
Now, if you just want to build projects that *use* Bitcoin's API, then you can use almost any language.  Python has a very good ecosystem around Bitcoin, as does JavaScript.  Indeed, there's even a "full-node" implementation of Bitcoin in Python.  And tons of Bitcoin-related JavaScript projects. Both are relatively easy to learn.
So if you'd like to start building projects that *use* Bitcoin's APIs and then move on to C++ and contributing to the core project, I think starting with C or Python is a good idea.
Or, you can just learn Go and skip everything above.  Go is a relatively easy-to-learn language, yet there's a strong full node implementation being build in Go that will almost certainly become as popular among Bitcoin businesses as the original Bitcoin core project once it's done due to its robustness and solid engineering (it's called btcd).

You make some good points, and I agree that Bitcoin will face an uphill battle to be adopted by the majority of the population of any given country.
However, one of the beautiful things about Bitcoin is that it doesn't *have* to be adopted by the majority in order to provide value.  Right now, for example, gambling companies are piling on to the Bitcoin train since they've realized its a beautiful way for users to fund their accounts that don't require a bank account.  Due to the wildly diverging gambling laws from state of state in the U.S., most banks are very hesitant to allow online games of chance to open accounts.  So Bitcoin fills in the gap.
This will continue to happen in areas where a market suffers from a lot of friction.  A lot of those markets will be behind the scenes for consumers, who will never even know that the company they're doing business with uses Bitcoin to pay their suppliers.
But although you make some good points, your overall message -- I'm getting out! -- is a definite buy signal for me, particularly if I start seeing a lot of these types of messages.  It's worked the past 3 times for me, so I'm increasingly confident this pattern will hold in the future.
We shall see.

Actually, a system like this exists right now for technologically-savvy users.  It's called the  Web of Trust, and it's been in operation since 2010 (I *think* -- at the very least, it was there when I started using Bitcoin in early 2011).   traders use it very effectively to make trust-based trades of Bitcoin.
But it's not something the general public can use in its present form due to the tricky technological requirements.
So good idea.... hmmm.

Here's why industry-specific regulations are almost always a bad idea, at least in the U.S.:
1.  There's a very well-known phenomenon that happens when a government agency in the U.S. (and likely elsewhere, too) regulates an industry.  Part of this is because of the "revolving door" practice where you have the leaders of regulatory agencies and leaders of industry moving back and forth between each other's jobs every few years.  But a lot of it is simply because the people drawn to working for a given regulatory agency are naturally interested in the field it regulates, and so are naturally sympathetic to many industries in that field.  Either way, the end result is regulatory agencies packed with people with major sympathies toward the industry figures they are regulating.  See the Fed whistleblower for a major expose of this situation in one regulatory agency (it's common across the board) [1].
2. Even if there were bona fide regulators in charge of their respective agencies, the problem of regulatory capture remains.  Established business in almost every highly-regulated industries use regulatory capture to keep out startups from challenging their position.  Big companies use political donations to drive regulation that is favorable toward established businesses and unfavorable toward small ones or startups.  The result is regulation that is designed *not* to protect the consumer, but regulation that is built as a wall to keep out new competitors.  We see this now in the financial industry and Bitcoin.
What is happening here with Lawsky and Bitcoin is not some kind of aberration or exception to the rule.  *This is how regulation in our country works*.  If our population fails to catch on to this, big business and big government will continue to conspire to drive our country to third-world status.
I think there should be a very thin layer of general, safety-related regulations (car seats, housing codes, fire codes, and a handful of other safety-critical areas) made at the state level by an agency of general safety regulators, and no specialized regulatory agencies.  In all other areas (particularly industries prone to fraud), consumers need to be taught how to be smarter and more discerning in the people they chose to do business with.  We've become into a nation of idiots, but no amount of government regulation can save us from ourselves.
Finally, let me point out that the lack of regulation in any given industry doesn't mean that it needs to fall prey to every scammer or lowlife around.  Lawsuits against fraudsters prosecutions should continue, but without regard to this or that microregulation in particular industries.  If you deceive people and steal their money, then you should be prosecuted for fraud.  I don't think that prosecutors needed any new financial regulations to prosecute pirateat40 for his pyramid scheme.  And so it goes for Moolah and (hopefully) Mt. Gox as well.

Actually, to the extent that sector mutual funds are considered investments, you're both speculating *and* investing.   The value of Bitcoin is inherently connected to the performance of all the companies operating in the Bitcoin economy.  But instead of a sector mutual fund or some similar investment device, we can just buy Bitcoins.
I do agree that people also are engaging in currency speculation when they buy and sell Bitcoin -- that's a large part of what drives these massive price shocks.  But long-term Bitcoin holders are more than anything investing on the success of the sum of companies working in this space.

Don't worry, that's coming online this year.  From several different angles, I think (hardware and software).
But the other two are much harder questions:
1.  Barrier of entry is thanks to the banks (well, and the impedance mismatch between reversible credit cards and non-reversible Bitcoins, but that's inherent).  Banks are realizing that Bitcoin could pose a major threat and hope to shut it down under the guise of AML/KYC.  And by making it hard for exchanges to sell Bitcoins and people to buy Bitcoins.
2.  Large, centralized pools are maybe not quite as hard, but still challenging.  I think that get the new getblocktemplate mining protocol can help, and yes, I think P2Pool will continue to improve and get easier to use.

Yeah, fine, but do you force your non-American spouse to open up his/her finances to the IRS?  That's one of the many things FATCA requires.  If you have a foreign spouse and you have say a joint bank account, your choices are:
**  Have your non-US spouse pay US taxes on all those assets *if* your bank doesn't kick you out because they can't comply with all the IRS reporting requirements (due to their country's privacy laws, and the cost of IRS compliance).
**  Move all your assets (house, banking account, etc.) into only the foreign spouse's name, potentially leaving a lot of people financially vulnerable.
OR 
**  Renounce US citizenship.
I mean, how would you feel if you married a non-American and his/her country claimed the right to tax all of your jointly-held assets?

It's exactly *because* of all the banking regulations that these banks are getting so big.  They protect against new competitors by using regulatory capture.  More regulations make the situation worse, not better.
You know why we don't have awesome, kick-ass Bitcoin exchanges everywhere?  Because regulation.  The smartest, most capable entrepreneurs are bright enough to know there's a good chance they'll end up doing a perp walk if they try to compete against the banks.  The banks protect themselves with regulations.

Just FYI, there's a pretty good likelihood that Gavin or one of the other core developers will wipe the testnet blockchain if they see your project is catching on.  They've already had to do twice before.
Testnet is *really* not supposed to be used for activities like this -- it hurts everyone developing software for Bitcoin, including the core devs, because it makes it hard/expensive to obtain coins to test out new software/new features.
Plus, this is going to confuse a lot of newcomers, who will think they are using real Bitcoins.
Please consider using an altchain instead of this.  There are hundreds now, many with very little worth yet fairly easy to obtain.  And they're just as easy to set up as testnet.
Dogecoin would be a good coin to test with, for example.  There are plenty of Dogecoin fountains.

Yeah, you really should look up dependent type systems.  It can't eliminate all errors, but it can eliminate entire classes of errors that are common in present programming languages.  There were a lot of blog posts after heartbleed showing how a dependently-typed language would have avoided this issue (or even a language like Rust with safer memory management).
While you're at it, look up refinement types, which will probably be integrated into mainstream languages before dependent typing. Refinement types can't eliminate all the errors that dependent typing can, but they can reveal many more errors than even the more advanced static typed languages without advanced typing can.

Bitcoins are actually not anonymous (more on this below).  No, the reason most of us believe Bitcoins have a future is because they enable effortless, global, person-to-person payments with very low fees.
In short, Bitcoin makes is incredibly easy to pay anyone -- your friend, a merchant in another country, an online seller, a family member in another country.  All for pennies, with no need for banks!
Many of us also believe Bitcoins have a strong future because it unlinks the exchange of value not only from banks, but also from governments.  How does it do that?  Well, much like Bittorrent, Bitcoin is a *decentralized* system.  No one entity controls it.  The engineering and design behind that idea are very advanced, and also incredibly robust -- meaning it's very resistant to outside forces that seek to corrupt or weaken it.
Anyway, this idea of unlinking currency from government can be a controversial idea for some people, so not all Bitcoiners are 100% happy about it.  But for many of us, it's a huge benefit.
Now, when I mentioned that Bitcoins are not truly anonymous, what I meant is that Bitcoins are actually linked to an identity.  It's just not *your* real-life identity (i.e., John Q. Public).  So they are what we call "pseudonymous".  It's close to being anonymous, but not quite.
That said, with a little knowledge, it's entirely possibly to use Bitcoins in an anonymous manner.  But it takes a little effort.

Hedgy looks very cool.  One question, though.  The web page says you don't touch Bitcoin, but rather an independent third-party holds the third key.

I think pro-actively *calling customers up* and asking them if they're in compliance with AML/KYC is being a little overly enthusiastic about it.  Banks absolutely have to report suspected AML violations, but there's no requirement to seek their customers out and ask them if they're doing any of the things they asked.
I mean, why not call customers up and ask them if they're actively funding a group on the State department watch list?
No, this isn't about AML/KYC, although that's what they'll call it.  This is about anti-Bitcoin.  They're in an extremely vulnerable position and now they're realizing it and trying to stem the tide.

Adafruit or Sparkfun, but I'd go with Adafruit since they accept Bitcoin.
Any small parts you can't find there you probably could find on Aliexpress.
But note that while this is a very cool project, it's not a Bitcoin ATM in the traditional sense.  It's a paper wallet issuer/seller.  So you're not getting Bitcoin's sent to an address of your choosing, rather, you're getting a paper wallet that you can then either save (as a safe paper wallet) or import (using any wallet that let's you import private keys).  
Actually, if one of the Android or iPhone wallets could scan a private key to import, that would make this a *very* easy and convenient way to purchase Bitcoins.  Evidently, this is a feature of Mycelium, but I've never used it.

Actually, merchant adoption is the one thing that seems to be moving forward quickly at this point.
Keep refining your idea and don't be discouraged by what I or anyone else tells you.
But I will say this: I think merchant adoption will take care of itself.  It's *consumers* we have to bring more value to.  Merchants already are attracted because there are no chargebacks, little to no processing fees, and it's relatively easy to set up.
Consumers are the ones who are hesitating.  We have to offer them Bitcoin services that bring them value.  And some iteration of what you're designing may do that.  That said, I think decentralized services are the way to go from a marketing perspective, due to the disposition of Bitcoin's core audience.

I don't, and here's why.  Once you're "in" the crypto currency system, moving from one currency to another is ridiculously easy.  So would be trivial to have a store of Bitcoins as your wealth, and take them out into Zerocoin to spend.  In fact, this may be the best option now since truly anonymous coins may be even more unpalatable to the political "leadership".
Of course, if enough coins start to move into Zerocoin, that's the one people will store wealth in.

@_date: 2014-09-28 12:18:58
You were asking me, but I hope you don't mind if I throw in my thoughts:
1.  Breadwallet looks to be a fine mobile wallet, but I'll offer this caveat: mobile phones should *never* be used to store more than a small balance sufficient for your everyday use.  Think of it as your BTC checking account.  For largest balances, the only appropriate place to save them is on an encrypted desktop wallet, preferably on a non-Windows desktop.  For a large enough balance (an amount that would be life-changing if you lost it), offline paper wallets are a must.
2a.  On almost every platform (iOS may be an exception -- not sure) it's possible to prevent devs from pushing out unwanted updates.  In fact, on most desktop wallets, it's not even an option.  For example, bitcoin-qt can't push out unwanted updates.  The most they can do is push out warnings for users to update their wallets.  
So for most wallets, this isn't even a concern.  iOS may be an exception, although I'm sure it's possible to prevent even iOS from pushing out updates if you root your phone.
2b. I do totally agree with your thesis that some people will prefer/require a wallet run by a 3rd party.  And this is fine, as long as they realize that there are alternatives if they're willing to put in a little more efforts.  That said, worrying about unwanted updates is not a good reason to use a wallet hosted with a 3rd party.

Yes, I'm aware that some people don't actually have possession of their Bitcoins, but instead entrust them to services like Coinbase to keep.  For those cases, you just make it clear that it only is available to those customers using local wallets.  I mean, it's not like Coinbase can issue a "wrong" signature and cause you to lose your money.  
It's just not available to users of (a few) web-based wallets. For example, I believe that blockchain.info lets you sign messages using the addresses you own.

I've noticed an odd phenomenon with "tech" people and Bitcoin.  Most of the "IT" people I've met -- network admins and support people -- have been very skeptical of Bitcoin, at least initially (a few came around).  Also, most people who are described as "techies" but who don't have any specific tech skills, like your friend who loves mobile phones, have been very wary and uninterested.
On the other hand, almost every single developer I've described Bitcoin to, with maybe one exception, were immediately excited and enthusiastic.

I've been working on an easy-to-use dedicated Bitcoin hardware node, which is about the same size and roughly the same price as a Wifi router.  You plug it in to your home network, install the GUI node management software, and then control the node from any computer on your network.
This would relieve your desktop/laptop computers of the burden of running a full Bitcoin node, yet it would be securely available to any computer on your home network.  You could manage it either through your browser (like you do your router) or through an installable desktop app.
I would sell this for somewhere around $150.  That's just a preliminary estimate -- I may be able to get it a little lower, or it may turn out a little higher.
Is this something that would interest folks?  If so, I can post photos and more information.
I've got a basic prototype of the software finished, but I hadn't been working on this project recently since I wasn't sure the demand was there.  However, I've recently seen a surge of interest in Bitcoin nodes, so I figured I'd throw this out there.

In addition to writing his (brief) memoir, Hal has also recently been doing some extremely critical work on Bitcoin security.  Namely, he's integrated bitcoin-qt / bitcoind with TPM (Trusted Platform Module).  On computers that have TPM-enabled hardware (many modern laptops and desktops), this project allows users to set limits on the amount of Bitcoins that could be withdrawn daily, *even on a computer with Bitcoin-stealing malware on it*.  It's hardware-level security, and extremely secure when implemented properly.
For more info, see Hal's post from last year at:

Like it or not, appcoins are one of the few monetization models available to anyone truly innovating in the cryptocurrency space (and this proposal is clearly an innovative -- if not a novel -- approach).
If you have any better ideas for how to monetize, I'd love to hear them.  Depending on donations absolutely doesn't work (I've seen some of the most popular Bitcoin projects only receive a small trickle of coins worth &lt; $100 a month).  An initial fund-raise is a great way to get started, but then what?
I hate to see the propagation of yet another appcoin, since I believe they weaken the BTC economy somewhat, but people will need to monetize.  Not everyone is motivated purely by ideology (and that's not a bad thing, by the way).
Do you have any other ideas for how this project could monetize?  That's a serious question, not a criticism.

Actually, if you read the guidance, it's pretty clear what their thoughts are, and it definitely would include Bitpay.  Now, we should bear in mind that this just FinCEN guidance and not any kind of formal law or court decision.

Good luck with your project.  By the way, are you aware of the famous U.S. politician named Strom (Thurmond)?  That's who most people older than 35-40 in the US will think of when they hear that word. I'm sorry to say that Strom Thurmond was not a particularly admirable politician (big surprise, I know) [1].
I know that Strom simply means "stream" in Swedish, but it's worth considering the different emotional impact different words have on people of different cultures when creating branding.  See the outcome of GM branding a car "Nova" (pronounced "no va") in South America.  I only mention it so you won't be surprised when people bring it up (and they will).
In any case, best of luck with your project.  It sounds exciting!  I look forward to following your progress.

The problem is that the top two POS software vendors (Micros and Radiant/Aloha) have *tightly* locked down APIs that cost tens of thousands of dollars for developers to license and $800+ for *each user* of the APIs in some cases (meaning *each business*... in addition to their normal license fees).

Kashmir: As someone who enthusiastically supported your Bitcoin coverage in the earlier days (like early last year), I'm disappointed in your recent writing.
At the best, you seem to be mindlessly following popular sentiment about Bitcoin. When Bitcoin was rapidly rising in value last year, your pieces were filled with hyperbolic praise and excitement.  Now that Bitcoin has been losing value vs the USD, you seem to be jumping on the anti-Bitcoin bandwagon that is now so prevalent in our society.
At the worst, you are pushing some sort of political agenda, perhaps due to the fact that Bitcoin could potentially pose a threat to traditional Democratic and Republican monetary policy.
I'd encourage you to take an honest look at your motivations when writing about Bitcoin, and strive to write in a more informative -- and less biased and confrontational -- manner.

This is me 100%.  As a former developer working in another field, I was technologically intrigued by Bitcoin in late 2010.  By the time mid-2011 rolled around, Bitcoin had caused me to regain my passion for software development as I built up a Bitcoin-related service (never released for legal reasons, that's another story).
By 2012, Bitcoin and its community -- and a few other events in my personal life -- had changed me from a civil libertarian liberal to a pretty hard-core libertarian.  Anyone who says Bitcoin is politically neutral frankly hasn't yet fully grasped the full extent of Bitcoin's potential as a vehicle of political change.
These days, I work happily as a software developer, currently working on a contract for a very cool Bitcoin company, and get paid in Bitcoin (pegged to USD).
Bitcoin has had a big impact on my life, for the better.  And no, I didn't get rich from being an early adopter since I failed to act on several big opportunities --- lesson learned.  I won't make that mistake again.

This is simply wrong: an address balance is very simply the sum of it's UTXOs.  Come back here when you *ever* find a wallet whose sum of addresses calculated thus do not equal the sum of its UTXOs.  These two number will *always* be equal.
Edit: And let me preempt any comment about multi-signature and other non-pay-to-address outputs.  If any address has those outputs that affect its balance, then so does the containing wallet.
Because a wallet's UTXOs are the sum of its addresses' UTXOs.

But I agree that Texas has struck a very agreeable, reasonable pose toward digital currencies.
Of course, even in those states with no money licensing requirements, you still have to comply with federal (FinCEN) regulations.  Fortunately, that's just administrative overhead -- there's no capital requirements and huge licensing fee.

I had the same problem out of the blue last week with an older blockchain account using 2FA.    Suddenly, the 2FA no longer worked (all my 5 other 2FA accounts on that phone worked fine).

Umm, by doing what entrepreneurs do now: either bootstrapping (growing company by sales) or by selling partial ownership to venture capitalists.  Neither of these involve debt.  If your venture fails, you don't owe the venture capitalists for "lost ownership".
And now, there's even one more option: Kickstarter, bounties, and similar arrangements.  We've seen some sizable ventures started in the Bitcoin world through bounties.
Furthermore, it's not corporate debt I'm railing against.  For certain capital-intense businesses, the options above might now work (although I'd really take a hard look before giving up on them).  So the business takes out a loan.  I don't have a problem with corporate debt, since it placing no personal liability on owners/employees.
But if you have no other option for your business other than a personal loan, this is a big problem with our economic and financial system.
In short, it's personal debt, and the central role it has in our society, that I'm railing against: student loans, mortgages, credit card debt, payday loans, etc.

Sadly, I've noticed that Hal hasn't been committing in recent months, which probably means it's become to arduous to do so (or maybe he's just concentrating on other things in life now).  
But it can definitely be used if you know how to use git and compile the code:

It's on the "flicker" branch, which is what I linked to above.
If enough people are interested in this, I can contact Hal to see if there's anything I can do to help things along (although I'm nowhere near the developer Hal is).
If you do try it out, just be aware that this is prototype software, so it could be risky to use it without additional testing.
So I'd say it's definitely not ready for public use.

Nope, that's proof that *someone* who owns that many coins signed the message.  It wouldn't have to be the person claiming ownership.  Could be a friend or ally helping out.
But in this case, it wasn't a signature; Karpeles or someone moved a certain number of coins requested by his customers from the stash in question, thereby proving he (or someone he was working with) had control.
Both are vulnerable to the same "attack": a friend, or even someone he paid a large sum to, could have signed or moved the stash on his behalf, and made it look like he controlled coins he didn't.

I'm really confused by the Python remark.  What miner are you all using now that Python would be a complication?  You must be on Windows.  Just a precompiled exe of cgminer, is that it?  Well, Python apps can relatively easily be packaged into an exe, if that's what you're needing.
Otherwise, both Macs and Linux come with Python preinstalled, so I'm not sure where the barrier is.  Can you help me understand?  I'm on Linux.
Frankly, I always figured anyone mining would be comfortable with Python (or Java, or C, or PHP, etc.).  But I guess the mining world is moving on into the general population.  Makes me a little sad that I'm not able to participate significantly anymore (mined Bitcoin from early 2011 -- Bitcoin was already getting hard to GPU mine by then -- to late 2012, now can only mine scrypt coins).

Satoshi was almost certainly not involved in creating the Foundation.  For example, according to Gavin, his last communication with Satoshi was in April 26th 2011, when Satoshi sent him the cryptographic keys to Bitcoin's alert feature.
Bitcoin Foundation was created in September of 2012, well over a year since Satoshi's last e-mail to Gavin and two years after his last public post on Bitcointalk (in December 2010).
Most of the other board members have never even communicated with Satoshi at all.
So it's highly unlikely he had anything to do with the Foundation.  The Foundation has "borrowed" his name in an effort to give themselves legitimacy, but there's no indication Satoshi approved of any of this.

Don't get too excited.  Bear in mind 2 things:
1.  This is a state government hearings.  It's an important state, but it's still definitely not representative of the U.S. as a whole.
2.  Bureaucrats like to say nice things to politicians and make everyone happy, but then go do the opposite thing to increase their bureaucratic turf.  It's what makes them bureaucrats.  
We've already seen bureaucrats act like this following the U.S. Senate hearings, where the FinCEN rep solemnly assured Sen. Carper that they would take care not to be heavy handed and squelch innovation.  Only weeks afterwards, her agency turned around and *was* heavy-handed toward several Bitcoin businesses, notably sending a threatening letter to Mike Caldwell, who sold collector Bitcoin physical coins in return for Bitcoins (never for USD), stating that he was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter -- a pretty strict interpretation of their regulations.
So remember that among U.S. politicians and bureaucrats, talk is very cheap.  It's how they *act* in the coming months that will reveal their true intentions.  And I'm not very optimistic for the U.S.

To legally operate a Bitcoin ATM, you only need to register as a money transmitter in the state you actually operate in.  ATMs are different from online exchanges, which sell to the entire country.
Are you sure they're requiring you to register as Money Transmitters in all 48 states that have such requirements?
If so, they've incredibly (and unnecessarily) limited their market right there.
But I totally agree, Robocoins are an incredibly poor investment, unless you live in a huge metropolitan area with intense interest in Bitcoins -- and even then it's iffy.  Lamassu is a *much* better investment.  Just stick it in a bar or shopping mall (have to work out a deal with the owner, but there's no annual maintenance or revenue sharing with Lamassu).

Well, if Coinbase's web wallet doesn't transmit transactions immediately, that's a problem with Coinbase that needs to be addressed by them.  If it's an inconvenience for the customer, they should move to another wallet.  
I've actually never heard of a wallet, mobile, web-based, or otherwise, that doesn't transmit transactions immediately.  In the case of Blockchain, tx's are actually probably propagated throughout the network *faster* than most full nodes because of Blockchain's large number of connected nodes (100+, or more).

I completely agree that we need more diversity in the Bitcoin community, and all the Bitcoiners I know personally would welcome it.
But why frame this problem as "...The Many White Dudes Working On Bitcoin" (frankly, a racist headline)?  Instead, why not frame it as something more like "Bitcoin's struggle to increase adoption among women and minorities"? 
The more journalists emphasize the fact the Bitcoin is mostly geeky white guys, the harder it will be for us to attract women and minorities.  I realize that increasing Bitcoin adoption is not your job, but that's nonetheless the dichotomy.
So why not find women and minorities in the Bitcoin community and write about *them*?  That would be a more interesting angle for most readers, instead of yet another "haha, look at all the geeky white guys doing tech stuff" article.

There's a very simple way to automate you could set up on your end using signed messages.  
1.  Customer starts refund procedure on Bitpay website: Bitpay automatically issues customized message with random string inside for customer to sign.  Include customer instructions on how to sign message using Bitcoin-QT, Armory, and whatever other clients support message signing (most?).
2.  Customer signs message and pastes signed message along with refund address into web page and hits submit.  Box pops up warning them that full amount will be sent to refund address that was just submitted.
3.  Bitpay automatically verifies signature and issues refund to refund address.
Now that almost every Bitcoin client incorporates easy GUI interface for message signing, there's really no reason not to have this system set up.

I just want to clarify this, since some may be mislead.  
If you have strong programming skills, interview well, and are willing and able to move to San Francisco or a few other large metropolitan areas in the U.S., you can make a great living.
If you have strong programming skills and are very good at marketing yourself on the web, and you love marketing (writing blog posts, Twitter, self-promoting at conferences), then you can make a great living freelancing from anywhere.
But if you're just a regular programmer in Flyover, USA or most of the rest of the world, including Europe, being a programmer is not typically a particularly well-paid profession.   If you can keep up with new technologies (all the time!), you probably won't starve, but you're not going to be making a ton of money, either.
Either way, you have to love what you're doing or you won't be able to stand the tedium and stress that sometimes accompanies developer work.

Anyone dealing with Bitcoin should be validating input addresses.  This is people's money we're talking about.  I really like your project, but either validate inputs or market it as a general purpose QR code generator.
A warning like ascliimo describes would do nicely.  But no validation isn't acceptable for Bitcoins.  I'm really rarely the dev to be critical of anybody's project, but I also really don't like to see people losing money because of things like this.  And yes, I've seen it happen due to lack of validation.  
bitcoin-js has some nice open-source code to validate Bitcoin addresses:   It's in address.js under src/ directory.
Besides, you can't use it as a general purpose QR generator without changing the code, since it uses the Bitcoin URL scheme.

I think it's a great quote, but as someone very sympathetic to libertarian ideology, I'm not a big Ayn Rand fan.  Her emphasis on selfishness is unattractive.  It's entirely possible to value human freedom and share her skepticism about big government, and yet hold her views on selfishness and greed as unfortunate and a net negative for the individual *and* society.
I personally believe that in a system where big government doesn't hand out favors right and left to big business, the massive accumulation of wealth on the scale we see in today's world is simply not possible.  
It's unfortunate that people lump together Rand's extreme views on greed and selfishness with libertarianism.  Most people don't realize that Rand herself was not a big fan of libertarianism, and was openly contemptuous of ancaps.  
I'm 100% capitalist and a big believer in the free market, but I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with charity and donations.  And based on the reception of Sean's Outpost among hard-care Bitcoiners, I think most people here share my views on this matter.

I honestly can't understand this. I install Linux Mint and *everything just works*.

My preference for Linux isn't just because of the non-open source thing -- I don't mind using efficient closed-source software (Visual Studio is a great piece of software, for example).  Although being able to run open source tools is a big win for productivity, since I can customize them when I want to.
I also don't have to worry about malware lurking on every corner of the Internet, or running multiple anti-virus programs (it took me *years* before I was finally convinced that I didn't need one on Linux).
All in all, running Linux is much more convenient for me, and I dread having to boot up Windows to test out software.

As someone in Bitcoin since early 2011, and who has read most of Satoshi's posts on Bitcointalk, I agree 100%.  Also, it was clear that Satoshi had access to some sort of computer lab.  This guy doesn't fit that picture.  Everything points to a university project, likely in the UK or Ireland.
In terms of the kids speculating that their father is Satoshi, it's not surprising.  I mean, wouldn't you love to find out that your Dad, who appears to have spent the past decade of his life playing with toy trains (not that there's anything wrong with that!), had invented a ground-breaking new technology?  Of course, most of us would.  But even one of the kids pointed out that the writing didn't look like his father's.
Also, as many here have pointed out, Satoshi Nakamoto is a very common Japanese name.  That may be why the real Satoshi chose it as a pseudonym.

Or did you send him an address?
If he sent you an actual Bitcoin wallet in the form of a file, and you're new to Bitcoin, it's very possible that you're not doing something correctly and that the money *might* be there.

The problem with most software changes to the protocol is that they require a hard fork, which would be exceptionally difficult to carry out since it would have to be extremely well coordinated with miners.
If miners can't get their shit together enough to find another pool to mine on, then why would anyone believe that they would be able to coordinate together for a hard fork.

I thought onename.io was actually up to something interesting, which was to use the namecoin blockchain as a distributed authentication system.  This would actually be a great step forward from the current centralized oauth-centered auth systems that are popular.
Unfortunately, it looks like they've pivoted toward being "real names for your bitcoin address".  I guess the underlying authentication system is still available through namecoin directly, but they don't seem to have a public API up anymore and the focus of the service seems to have changed.
Hopefully, it's just a marketing move and the underlying motivation is still a distributed authentication system.
And yes, Bitcoin could be used for the same thing.  But using namecoin avoids the whole "polluting the blockchain" issue that we are all so aware of.

No, this is wrong.  Even in a network with a 50%+ miner, no one can take your transaction and re-route it!  It's been cryptographically signed against that by extraordinarily strong crypto.  NSA-defying crypto.

You're correct to write "almost", since Bitcoin itself is build in a manner that allows multiple parties to verify each other's builds.  They use a piece of software called Gitian, which was created by the developer *devrandom* especially for this purpose: 
Gitian can be used for any software project that uses git as long as it's set up properly -- quite an arduous task at the moment.  But for a project like Bitcoin, where it's critical for no malware to somehow embed itself in the software, it's worth the extra time it takes to verify builds.
However, if the final Apple app store builds are done on a remote server owned by Apple, then this wouldn't be possible.  I've never made an Apple app (I make Android apps), so I can't say for sure.

I'm guessing this will just be offered as a private party service, just like Visa/Mastercard at the stadium.  So it's not integrated into the student account directly.
Regarding the confirmation time, at least at the present time, it's perfectly fine to accept 0 confirmation transactions for low-value items.  Double-spending 0 confirmation tx is possible, but it's a lot harder than most people think it is, and I'm sure Bitpay will deploy its usual defenses against double-spends.  So the payment should go through near instantaneously, just like it does with a Bitpay payment online.

OK, sure, the user interface can be incredibly easy, even now.  But when I say Bitcoin will *never* be easy to convert, I mean that no country is going to allow exchanges to just convert fiat to BTC for their customers without having them go through the whole KYC/AML rigmarole.    If your country isn't enforcing those laws right now, look for it in the next 2 years.
That said, I'm still very optimistic about Bitcoin's future because once you're "in" the Bitcoin system, global trade and commerce becomes *incredibly* simple.  And that *will* only get easier in the future.

The main point of a salt is to protect against rainbow tables, or pre-calculated hashes of common words, expressions, and passwords stored in a large table, as well as similar attacks.  
By adding a salt to the hash, an attacker can no longer match the hashes he has with the ones in his rainbow table.  So the attacker has a generalized weapon against common passwords, but the database he's snatched now has "specialized" passwords that won't match any in his table.

Sell your Bitcoins or not, don't care either way, but this community is just a bunch of random people on a subreddit.  If you want to really get a feel for how Bitcoin is being marketed, look at some of the more successful Bitcoin services: coinbase, bitpay, bitstamp, blockchain.info, circle.
Of all of those companies, the only one I've seen with a wooden marketing tone is blockchain.info (which unfortunately is also one of the most promising services).

However, if you choose to store your life savings in Bitcoin (a very risky move at this point), then you need to at least understand how to safely run Linux and create offline paper wallets.  If you're storing that much money in a volatile new currency, I don't think that's too much to ask.

So in answer to your question, I think the companies growing and expanding in the Bitcoin industry will advertise for bitcoin.

If you're talking about mom and pop miners with an Antminer in their basement, then I agree.  If you're talking about big-time mining operations, then traditionally the answer is no.  At least when I was in the game (with my 2 7900s, lol), I know big miners like ArtForz and people of similar size would carefully not only audit the code, but also exhaustively customize it to their needs.
I'd be pretty surprised if these guys above, for example, aren't doing the same.
And better than alternative projects using bitcoin core, why not support a completely separate full bitcoin node implementation like btcd.  They've developed a very well-engineered full node that's recently gone from alpha to beta release.

You know, I'm a dev and I'd put in the time to help make it better if I felt that these miners would actually move.  But given their current -- well, let's say stubbornness -- I'm not convinced it would make any difference.
Also, I think GHash is actually subsidizing their payouts from the cex.io income (or elsewhere?).  And P2Pool can't compete with that, no matter how well it's designed and packaged.

Unfortunately, under AML/KYC, it's absolutely his job to police how people use the legal products he sells them *according to the U.S. government*.  That's what KYC is all about.
Ultimately, that's why I never opened an exchange.  Because I couldn't stomach the thought of being required by law to inform on my own customers, even if I didn't believe they were doing anything wrong.
So we have HSBC off the hook scot-free, and Charlie in jail for decades (likely).  Foreign wars (maybe Syria, too!), bailouts of bank oligarchs, mass imprisonment of minorities/poor/non-violent people.  Mass police brutality when there are protests.

Unless the GP changed his question, you didn't respond to his comment about non-payment, so I'll answer it: using BitcoinJ, it's possible to securely make lots of tiny microtransactions, which are settled on the Blockchain and pre-determined intervals.  So you'd be paying ahead by say, 1 minute intervals, or 30 sec intervals.  The moment you stop paying, your service is cut.  So there's little risk for either party.
This would all be done automatically by the software -- users would not have to worry about any of this.
tkembo, to answer your question abour premining, I'll answer frankly: if you premine more than a trivial sum, you will be shunned by both the altcoin and Bitcoin communities (most of the Bitcoin community will ignore you anymore for using an altcoin).

OK, if you're careful about privacy, and each address has only one UTXO, then the same applies. 
But in practice, of course, addresses frequently do have more than one UTXO.  And in this case, the same applies: the sum of a wallet's UTXOs is equal to the sum of its addresses' UTXOs.
In all cases, the sum of a wallet's addresses equals the sum of its addresses' UTXOs.
Also, of course you send "from" an address.  The receiving address's private key, alone or in combination with other keys, is *exactly* the only thing that lets you send those output/s.  Nothing related to a wallet or accounts will allow you to send that output or outputs.
Look, I get that their is a privacy motivation for stressing the importance of using addresses as one-time payment receivers, and I'm sympathetic to that motivation.  But that doesn't change the fact that Bitcoin doesn't *have* to be used that way.  And trying to claim that somehow it's not possible to use them in the way that you don't want them to be used -- when it is absolutely possible -- is at best misleading.
Instead of arguing against reality, try arguing *for* privacy.
Edit: Also, we've been talking in the context of bitcoin-qt, when there have *long* been multiple other Bitcoin wallets out there, and even services, none of whom even have a concept of "accounts".  Many, like blockchain.info, rely mostly on a single address as the account.  I get where this is privacy-damaging, but it's reality.  Instead of pretending it doesn't or can't exist, why not educate?
@_date: 2014-08-29 21:07:18


Ah, but anonymity can *only* be guaranteed when dealing electronically.  There's no government in the world that can break something encrypted with a 4096-bit PGP key.
And while it's true that Bitcoin is presently not incredibly strong on privacy, once people start holding funds in BTC, the cat is out of the bag.  Nothing is easier than changing one crypto to another.  It's trivial.  Rest assured that better things are on their way.

Yeah, he actually made some major progress on a special version of bitcoin-qt that would only allow a certain amount of withdrawal per day (can be configured).  It used the TPM module included with many modern computer systems to cryptographically secure the coins.
With this version of bitcoin-qt running, the system could be full of malware and still it couldn't withdraw more than the configured amount (please note this doesn't apply to the current version of bitcoin-qt!).
I've been looking at his code at hopes of updating it (it's from over a year ago).   Hal had coding skills I can't hope to match, but I'll definitely post if I make any progress.  I don't want all his progress to go to waste.

Not too hard, particularly if you're strong in frontend or mobile apps.  Check out Coinality and I've found some really good clients there, you just have to be selective.
You can also mention to your existing clients that you give a discount for Bitcoin payments.  I give my Bitcoin clients a sizable discount because 1) I save 3% to as much as 10% in bank fees, depending on size of the job. and 2) I get the money much quicker, and that's time during which I don't have to worry about a client failing to pay.  There are several companies that make it easy for employers to pay employees in Bitcoin (Bitpay is one, I've also heard of Bitwage but I've never used it).
You're welcome to PM me your background and rates, and if we're a good match I may be able to sometimes offer your overflow work to be paid in Bitcoin.

I'm afraid there's the problem already.  As you've said yourself, Bitpay and Coinbase are signing people up because they have a clear profit-motive.  Now, I'm not saying there's never a need for volunteer organization (there clearly are).  But this is not one of them.
You/we need to think of a way for a company to promote direct Bitcoin usage to merchants *and still make money*.  That company will have much more of a chance at succeeding that yet another "industry organization", which come and go in the Bitcoin world more often than I change my socks.

To be clear, this is not Bitcoin's failure, this is TigerDirect's failure, combined with Bitpay's shitty payment system where you only have 15 minutes and sometimes much less to pay your invoice.  They need to find a better way to deal with currency risk than these 15 minute invoices.

But I think if Bitcoin is universally accepted, $1 a coin is extremely unlikely.  But as a thought exercise, I understand the need for posing the question in extremes.

But as more and more users hold Bitcoin, a robust Bitcoin-only economy will begin to bloom.
In my case, it already has.  An increasing number of my software development contracts are paid in Bitcoin.  And although I change a portion of those Bitcoins into USD, I keep a lot to save or to spend on companies that accept Bitcoin.  Gyft is particular is getting a lot of business from me.

Well yes, money deposited at a bank isn't a possession of the depositer (at that point it's still a possession, but it belongs to the bank).  I think we're all aware of that here.
You appeared to be claiming something more radical -- that we don't own our own money, such as our money in our pocket.  Which is clearly untrue.
On retrospect, your sentence could be parsed in two different ways:
1.  Point is that...money is not a possession.
or 
2.  Point is "that money"...is not a possession.

Sure, it's open source hardware.  In many ways, it's just like open source software.  In fact, it *is* open source software fundamentally.  There are lots of opencores hardware projects comprising many different hardware devices, but the big processors usually take the form of an open source description of the CPU using a hardware description language like verilog of VHDL.  
You can take a processor described by such a language and implement it on any FPGA large enough (there are literally hundreds and hundreds of FPGAs build by manufacturers around the world) or you can pay a manufacturer to build it for you (I think some kickstarter campaigns are doing this).  Also, some low-volume manufacturers and even larger hardware companies are starting to use open source hardware IP to make some or all of their own hardware.
In short, there now exists some powerful microprocessors that are entirely open source.

Ideally, we will reach a point when we can buy and sell most goods using Bitcoin and when we don't need to use an exchange, but we're obviously still far from being there, even in the U.S. and Canada.  But I think 2014 will be a watershed year for Bitcoin.

Please check your facts before you post information like this again.  Check the Bitcoin wiki, for example.
There *is* a huge threat that becomes a reality exactly when a pool crosses the 50% line: the ability to mine the longest chain in secret.
Here's the Bitcoin wiki on the subject:
"If the attacker controls more than half of the network hashrate, the previous attack [brute force attack] has a probability of 100% to succeed. Since the attacker can generate blocks faster than the rest of the network, he can simply persevere with his private fork until it becomes longer than the branch built by the honest network, from whatever disadvantage." [1]
That's a huge threat to Bitcoin, and it only happens at 50%.

The U.S. government claims jurisdiction over any company serving its citizens.  And if you offer money transmission services to U.S. citizens without the millions of dollars in state licenses required to operate legally, the U.S. government considers this a major crime.   You don't have to have *any* ties to the U.S. other than having U.S. citizens as customers.  No registered corporation, no offices, nothing.
When you elevate this kind of governmental scrutiny to account for the kind of money that was passing through Mt.

I would approach it from the point of view that Bitcoin has gained popularity first in markets where there is the most friction (online drug markets), and is slowly moving now to markets where there is a moderate amount of friction (gambling, porn).
I suspect Bitcoin will continue to fill those voids where the traditional banking system refuses to service.  For example, people who can't get personal checking accounts (for reasons of credit and/or nationality) and businesses that can't get business accounts (e.g. medical marijuana).
Another area where's there's a moderate amount of friction is in international settlement of large business accounts (like in shipping).  Now people have to deal with cumbersome letters of credit.  I could see Bitcoin moving here, particularly if/as it stabilizes.
Also payment of international contract labor (freelance translators, etc.) where a huge amount of their pay is eaten up in fees and takes 1-2 weeks to arrive.
Where is will go from there is probably whatever markets have the most connections to those original markets.
And dude!  You waited until the week before to start your bachelor's thesis?

Well, even credit unions interface with fiat *somewhere*, whether that's a payment processor or Visa/Mastercard themselves.  Those entities have just as much incentive to shut Bitcoin out, and will surely do so.
The answer is to move more and more to a full Bitcoin economy.  Get paid in BTC, spend it in BTC.  I'm already 50-60% there (many of my dev contracts are paid in BTC, and I pay for many of my household expenses in BTC).

No, it's not!  Saying "Chief Bitcoin scientist" is akin to saying "CEO of Bitcoin" -- neither of those things exist.  Bitcoin is a decentralized system -- there is no "CEO" or "Chief Scientist" or "Marketing Director" or any of these other titles that people seem to yearn for in.

The firm would want to use something like  to parse the Blockchain into a format easier to query, like SQL (blockparser can do this).
There was also a Java Bitcoin full node software that can store the Blockchain in a Postgresql database, which could be easily queried:   But it appears to be unmaintained now.  
So the simplest would be to use blockparser on a machine with a lot of memory (32+ GB at the least) and then work with the SQL tables it enables you to generate.

First of all, did you make a paper wallet backup like you're strongly urged to by Armory when you first set up?  If so, you're definitely fine.
If not, hopefully you didn't delete your Armory wallet file when you were doing this deleting.  As long as you didn't delete the wallet, you're fine.  Just start up Armory in offline mode and export the wallet in some other format, like described here:

Then compile this package:

Then get your Safari or whichever browser you're using process ID:
    ps -A
Then dump the memory, filling in your PID where I have PID_HERE:
    readmem -p PID_HERE -o memdump -m
Then dump to text file and see if you see a private key:

Easy, these are things like popular donation addresses, or other addresses that send or receive a ton of value to or from new addresses (recall that addresses are just hashed public keys, so there is a 1:1 correspondence and the chart would look the same with addresses).
If you look, you can see that one address stopped receiving or sending coins about halfway through the graph (impossible to say which way without being able to zoom in).  I wonder whose address that was.

The "slope" is because the rate of transactions increases over time as Bitcoin sees greater adoption.

First, let me say clearly: if you have a large Bitcoin balance, let's say greater than 5% of your net worth, you should store most of the balance *offline*.  Bitcoin Armory has a great offline wallet option -- after using the Satoshi client for the past ~3 years I've switched to Armory and am extremely impressed.  It's not any harder than a typical bank account web page to figure out, so if you have problems with it's just because you're not familiar and need to spend more time learning about it.  I'm also working on an web-based offline signing solution that should be fairly idiot-proof and easy to use (create and manage transactions online, sign them offline on another computer).
Second, as a way to manage small amounts of Bitcoin spending money, I strongly recommend blockchain.info.  Ben Reeves has done everything in his power to create a safe, easy-to-use system.  I think he can still make some improvements to the UI to make things easier for new users (mostly by hiding unneeded information), but I'm very happy with what he's done so far and highly recommend it to friends and family.  Furthermore, he's not operating anonymously like so many other online wallet providers who have run off with people's money.  HOWEVER, you should never store the majority of your balance on *any* online wallet.  You should store it on an offline wallet like the one offered by Bitcoin Armory, or at worse, on an encrypted online wallet using the Satoshi client.
Finally, people do need to recognize that Bitcoin is fundamentally different from banks and credit cards.  All transactions are absolutely final.  This is hugely beneficial to merchants, and will change the way online commerce is done, but it also places a large amount of responsibility on users' shoulders. Anyone uncomfortable with that responsibility should carefully consider their decision to use Bitcoins.  In the future, services will arise that make Bitcoin more "idiot-proof", but for the moment, it's best used by people comfortable with basic technology and open to learning new things (but we're also the ones who will benefit the most as adoption increases).
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:45:49
I would agree, but here's the thing: the banks have a government-granted monopoly here.  They have captured this sector of the economy through government regulation.
If the government had not erected walls around this sector of the economy, Bitcoin would already be taking over banking.  Hell, I'd *love* to become a CoinKite partner in my state, but the regulatory barriers to entry here are way too high, even if I had abundant money.  If you challenge *banking* regulations, even if it's in a total ethical manner, they lock you up and throw away the key under AML.
So it's not a fair free market fight.  The banks I'd take on any day of the week.  The banks + government = men with guns who will lock me up for challenging their hegemony.**
**But stubborn me, I'm still thinking of doing it, albeit with great care to comply with all regulations and a very good lawyer.

To be more explicit here, by a "halfware secure operating system", Zafolo is referring to Linux and OSX (I presume).  BSD is also very good.  Anyone who stores a non-negligible sum of Bitcoins on an unencrypted wallet on a Windows machine is at very high risk of major heartbreak.  If you're serious about learning about Bitcoin, learn how to install Linux on one of your old computers.  Wipe it clean of Windows, and install Ubuntu or Linux mint.  Then you can maintain that old computer offline as a signing machine using Bitcoin Armory.  You can still maintain and monitor your wallet on your windows machine, you just can't use it to send anything without first signing it on your offline computer.  
WARNING: Make sure you understand Armory offline wallets before you use them, and be sure to create and safely store a paper backup of any wallet you use to store Bitcoins.  It's very easy to do using Armory.

Then you're paying an incoming wire transfer fee for international wires, probably around $15 per.  You're just not aware of it because your bank is sneaky and deducts it from the sum you receive.  Check you bank's schedule of fees.


Yeah, you're not getting this, are you?  Budgeting doesn't help if your wages don't cover your basic expenses.  If the cost of living rises above your wages, and you're already working two or three jobs, and the check for your childcare is due, and you know that if you don't write that check, your child gets kicked out of his daycare program, what do you do?  You know damn well what your balance is, and it's not enough.  So you write the check and get zinged with $35 fee, and then pay the account back to a positive balance on your next paycheck.  People are using this "overdraft protection" as a short-term loan with outrageous interest rates.  The banks are aware of it, it's how they make a lot of their money.
By the way, if you're lecturing me about budgeting, your words are in vain, since I'm not even talking about myself.  Unlike you, I actually can put myself into other people's shoes and understand it's not always so simple.
Unlike some, I don't want to regulate the banks to change this shitty behavior.  But I damn well want to be able to offer people a reasonable alternative to this.  And I can't in most states, because of regulatory capture.  The government prevents me from competing.

You'd need to specify your target number of gigahash/sec before anyone could even begin to give an estimate.  1000 GH/sec would generate 1 block (25 bitcoins) every 45 days on average, but you would want to spread out the risk by joining another pool.

This is a brilliant project, probably the most innovative Bitcoin project I've seen since I first got involved in 2011.  So please don't take my criticism as discouragement -- you must continue to develop this!  However, there are some major concerns:
1.  You need to make it absolutely clear to users that this is a beta project and all their coins could be lost forever.
2.  You also need to make it clear that that end users are trusting both the gateway and you to be trustworthy and not lose their signatures.  You can't spend their coins by yourself, which is good, but you can lose them forever, which is real bad.  That needs to be made clear.

If you want to look at how much Bitcoin is being "used", you can look at total transaction per day, or week.  The problem with this indicator is that a single person moving a handful of coins back and force between addresses can artificially boost that number.
Bitcoin Days Destroyed doesn't have that weakness.  Once you've "spent" those days, you can't respend them.  So it's a good way of looking at how much Bitcoin is being used.  Really, it's the *only* in-network indicator of Bitcoin use that isn't vulnerable to simple manipulation.
Even if it's just someone transferring Bitcoin's from an old wallet to a new one, that's useful information, since it tells us those coins are still in circulation.

There are at least two entities with more power over the Bitcoin network than the Bitcoin Foundation:
1.  The miners
2.  The core developers.
The Bitcoin Foundation does advocacy (at least in theory) for Bitcoin, and they are responsible for paying the salary of 1 out of 6+ core developers, but they don't actually release any code.  In fact, I would posit that there's a 3rd entity with more control over Bitcoin than the Bitcoin Foundation, and that is us, Bitcoin users.  Together, we are usually able to exert a great deal of influence over the activities of both the core developers, and to a lesser extent, the miners.
Regardless, Bitcoin is *highly* decentralized, which is definitely a good thing.

I've had them for years, too, and they're great for car insurance.  But rest assured that despite their friendly customer service, they will fuck you over at a minute's notice.  We did business with them for years, including car insurance, checking/savings account, IRA, car loan, etc -- not one single missed payment or returned check in 10 years (5 for car loan).
Yet when it came time to get a home loan, they mysteriously turned us down after making some initial positive noises (we just need to get a few more things approved, etc).  This despite a very good credit score. Left us in a difficult position, although we were able to get other loan offers soon enough.

Bitcoin is an innovative payment system, not an investment.  And it's still in a very volatile stage and can go up and down a lot (as you've seen).  So don't expect it to behave like an investment.
What is backing bitcoin, if anything?
Bitcoin's value as a distributed payment system is what gave it its initial value.  Beyond that, people speculate on it and place value in it as an alternative to fiat currency.
Do any fortune 500 companies accept it?
You can pay for goods in many Fortune 500 companies through Gyft.  But I wouldn't put too much stock on what Fortune 500 companies do.  Large companies are conservative and will move slowly into innovative advances in finance and technology.
 
Can you cash it out? (Including foreign currencies (Not USD))
Which currency?  It's easy to cash out in USD and Euros, but for other currencies, it really depends on whether you have a local exchange or strong localbitcoin scene.

I don't think bitstamp lets you do this, but it'd be a great feature.
But the only way you can avoid manual tx entry is to use the API.  Obviously, security would be a big concern unless you only support exchanges like btc-e with read-only APIs available.
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:29:14
Exactly.  You start bitcoind on command line using the -walletnotify switch, and point it to some other command (your program).  Get the txid to your program using "%s" (resolves to txid on wallet notify).  So, something like:
bitcoind -walletnotify=myprogram %s
You may need quotes around myprogram and the %s, can't remember.
Then, using stdin, you read the input as hex, use the json-rpc API to convert it to JSON and use it (ie, look up the txid using gettransaction or some similar API command).  And then do the things you wrote above with getbalance and sendtoaddress.  
Actually, if you don't need the exact new transaction info, just the total balance, you don't even need to mess with the "%s" part.  You can just look up your balance on wallet notify.
It's much harder if you're dealing with arbitrary Bitcoin transactions, but as long as they're the ones in your wallet, it's pretty straight forward.

So consider this a thank you on behalf of my daughter.  She's learning how to make bracelets herself using that loom thing and was very happy to have a completed one as a model.
It also gave me a chance to explain Bitcoins to my daughter, who seemed to accept my explanation nonchalantly, and who now considers Bitcoins as a normal means of exchange alongside dollars.

Close.  The mining process is self-adjusting, and gets easier or harder depending on how much processing power is applied to mining.  It self-adjusts about every 14 days.
In addition, the size of the block reward (what a miner gets when she/he "solves" the puzzle) decreases by half every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every 4 years.  So we've already undergone the first reduction from 50 to 25 btc.

Is offline signing what you are wanting to do?   
I've got an open-source browser-based online/offline signing app I've built that should be coming online in the near future.  If you're able to run a modern Browser like chromium on your rasp pi this should work fine.  You just open up an HTML file in your browser when you're using it in offline mode and visit a website for online mode.  Please message me if you're interested and I'll contact you when it's ready to be used.
However, Electrum can be used for offline signing if you're comfortable with the command line. See:   You then run another copy of Electrum online to broadcast signed transactions, monitor your wallet, and prepare transactions for offline signing.

Of course they matter!  If you are using bitcoin-qt and you import an old address into a new wallet to make a purchase without understanding that your change goes to another address in the new wallet, instead of to back to the old address you imported, you may not realize that you need to store and backup the entire wallet.  Also, change addresses are one of the main reasons more addresses than the default 100 need to be issues, which means you need to re-back up your wallet.
Just use Bitcoin Armory as you main wallet.  It makes all these worries go away plus it enables the use of offline wallets to store large balances securely (make sure you read about Armory offline wallets before you use them).

Here's the thing -- in at least one industry (at least from what I've heard), there's close to being a virtuous cycle, where everyone from the manufacturers, to vendor, to at least some customers, are using and paying with Bitcoins.  I expect this will quickly pass to other industries once it becomes known how much money they're saving.
This is why the banks are panicking and starting to refuse to allow customers to fund Bitcoin exchange accounts (see the many posts from the last few days).  Because increasingly, they're not going to see that money again.  And to be honest, the fact that the banks are pulling this move now *is* an existential crisis for Bitcoin as a world currency.  How are we going to deal with it?  The answer is to help more consumer businesses accept Bitcoin, so people don't have to worry about "cashing out".
In fact, to do my part here, if you're a small mom and pop brick and mortar business in the Carolinas or Northeast Georgia (say Atlanta to the SC/NC border), I'll make this offer (and publicize it later).  I'm a developer who's been into Bitcoin since 2011 (see Bitcointalk username w1R903), and I'll come set your business up to accept Bitcoin *at no charge*.  I'll do this for the first 10 businesses that respond.  It may take a few weeks for me to schedule it, and it may be on a weekend, but I'll get it done.
If you're a larger business, or an online business, I'll do it at a significant discount.
I'll urge my fellow developers to do the same in their regions.  We have to get Bitcoin accepted in more physical locations, so people don't have to worry about cashing out as much.  Gyft has been a Godsend here, but we still have a long way to go, and banks are going to start shutting us out of their system *completely*.
Let's close the loop, and make this a full Bitcoin economy.

If you're holding a lot of Bitcoin and want to offset the currency risk (as well as cancel out any potential gains), you can look into purchasing Bitcoin derivatives at bitfinex or icbit.se, both of which make it very simple to short Bitcoin (at least I've heard bitfinex does, I've only actually used icbit.se).
So you can hedge your exposure to Bitcoin this way.  I'd recommend starting out slowly, with small sums, and once you get used to taking different positions, you'll be able to store larger sums in Bitcoin.
Or you can be like most of the rest of us and just ride the waves up and down, since in the end they're going up, up, up.

No, not at all.  The receiving address, which wallets display as a qr code, is your "public" key.
The key that unlocks your funds is your "private" key.  Unlike your receiving address, which starts with a "1", your private key starts with a "5" or "L".  You should never need to see your private keys if you're using a wallet app like Electrum or Bitcoin-qt, or any of the many others.  But that's what the "wallet.dat" file contains (in the base of bitcoin-qt).

Well, when you're looking at the higher-end ASIC models, power consumption is less of a concern, since it's such a relatively small portion of the cost.  The major up-front cost are the now ridiculously-overpriced ASIC miners.  However, if I were to buy an ASIC today, I'd be looking very carefully at what new deals Bitmain is offering here:
They've sold out for now, but they're supposedly coming up with some more.  Make sure you account for risk factors like the Chinese government deciding to ban *all* Bitcoin activity, since Bitmain is a Chinese company.  There are a few ASIC companies selling outside of China, but they are ridiculously overpriced now.
Otherwise, are you absolutely decided on mining Bitcoins, or would you be interested in mining altcoins like Litecoin and trading them for Bitcoins?  Because if that's the case, you can do so relatively profitably (break-even point in ~40 days) using GPUs.  GPUs are much harder to find, but there are still some good ones out there.

Absolutely, ask.  I did a Latin minor in university (total of 6 years of Latin from HS to university), and I'm pretty skeptical about the logo.  I remember questioning it when it was first proposed in summer 2011.  I really like the idea behind it, but I think there are three significant problems:
1) vires probably should be the singular vis.  "vires" means military forces.  The concept of "strength" is typically translated as "vis";
2) "in" is probably the wrong preposition, should be "ex";
3) word order is wrong for classical Latin.
So I think it probably should be something like:
"ex numeris vis" but even that I'm not 100% sure of; I'd need to confirm with someone with more expertise.
I'm sure there are those that will roll there eyes at these comments, but it does matter in the same way using correct spelling matters.  It doesn't give the impression we'd like to give.  I think it would actually be better to just use an English motto rather than an incorrect Latin motto.
So please ask on otherwise I will.

It's important to realize that as long as you have your private keys, and no one else has obtained access to your private keys, you have your Bitcoins.  A private key is simply a long string of characters: 5fafdaklfjdasklfdjaklfdasjfdkla  As long as you have your private key, you can create your public key (your Bitcoin address).  The various wallets are just convenient collections of public/private addresses.
So as long as I can pull out that string of characters, I can form a Bitcoin transaction to spend however many of the Bitcoins stored in that address.  You can even form these transactions manually if you know the format.  Once you have a "raw" transaction formed, you just broadcast it to the Bitcoin network using any bitcoin client or even a website like blockchain.info.  See: 
So worry about keeping your wallet safe and out of the hands of other people (password protecting it is one way to do this, using offline signing is another), and make sure you make regular backups.  As long as you do these two things, you shouldn't worry about a wallet becoming obsolete since you can always get the private keys out of an intact wallet file.

Yes, avoid Mt. Gox.  Bitstamp makes it easy for U.S. users to transfer money to and from their account via international wire, but you need to get verified first (which involves sending copies of ID and proof of residency, and may take a while given the present high level of interest in Bitcoin).  I've successfully used Bitstamp for the past year (been involved with Bitcoin since early 2011).
And you can think of confirmations as extremely strong, crypographic seals that the miners wrap groups of transactions in (in Bitcoin terms, this is called a "block").  Each time your transaction is "sealed" by the miners, you see another confirmation.

Firstly, there is no way to auto forward transactions.  You'll need to either give the people new addresses or import them into blockchain.info (this is fairly easy to do).  Go to "import/export", select import wallet, and paste in the pywallet output I describe how to do below.  But be aware that once you import your wallet into blockchain, you shouldn't probably shouldn't use it on bitcoin-qt, or you risk thinking you have more/less money than you actually do.
I would recommend you keep a small balance on blockchain.info for day-to-day transactions.  Think of it as your checking account.
I'd recommend you keep the rest of your Bitcoins offline.  Think of it as your savings account.  To do this, I would strongly recommend that you take a look at Bitcoin Armory.  Once you've downloaded it and started it (you must run a current copy of bitcoin-qt in the background), then it will give you the option to create a wallet.  So create a new wallet and you will see the option to create a paper wallet.  Print out the wallet and you'll see the codes you need to record.  At that point, and *this is the most important*, you need to transfer all the balance you want to save to an address from this new wallet.  You'll do this as a normal Bitcoin transfer from your old wallet on bitcoin-qt.
I would not recommend importing your old wallet from bitcoin-qt to Armory.  Create a new Armory wallet and transfer your funds to it from your bitcoin-qt balance as described above.
Your other option is to download pywallet (you must also have Python installed) if you're on Windows, run


If you're on Mac or Linux it will be a similar command adjusted to your OS.  This is the same process you would use to import a wallet into blockchain.info.  This outputs you private keys, which are the keys to the safe you want to etch into metal if you choose not to go the Armory route (which gives you private keys in a different format as part of the paper wallet).
You can download pywallet here:

You're clearly out of touch with the average man, and pretty supercilious about it.  If your salary hasn't risen in 10 years, like many folks around here, and the cost of living keeps rising, something's gone to give, and it's often in the form of an overdraft.  Sometimes, it's not something you can just magically pull your bootstraps out of.
And in response to your statement on international wire fees, check your bank statement and your bank fee list.  The fee on incoming international wires is subtracted from the incoming sum, and usually not itemized.  Check your bank's policy on incoming wires.  I've never heard of a bank with no incoming international wires fees for normal account holders.  The usual incoming fee is $12 to $35 for incoming international wires, depending on bank (I have a lot of experience with this).
However, I could be wrong in your case: the only time banks might waive this fee is for "premium" account holders with over $100,000 or $200,000 balance, which could explain why you're so out of touch.  Nothing wrong with being wealthy -- indeed I aspire to being wealthy myself.  But it is wrong to assume that just because you would deserve a $35 dollar overdraft fee if you let your account go under means, that also means that someone who's struggling to make ends meet deserves the same fate.

Well, "blockchain backdoors" basically describes the ZeroCoin concept, so it's important to realize that one man's "accounting fraud" is another man's freedom of privacy.

bitcoind is the backend to bitcoin-qt.  It can run as a daemon and do everything that bitcoin-qt can do using the command line or json-rpc interface.
The best way to approach your requirements is run the bitcoind client with the ` -walletnotify=&lt;cmd&gt; ` switch, with `%s` being the txid.  Then use json-rpc to run the commands for looking up the txid and decoding the returned hex into json, which you can then use to do whatever you want with it there using (send it here or there, split it up, etc.). 
If you know how json-rpc works, these two pages are all you need:

That's exactly what I showed you how to do.  Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to do so using the bitcoin-qt GUI.  That's the reason you can't figure it out.  
And again, there is no one single private address.  There are hundreds.  Each of your Bitcoin addresses you use to receive money on bitcoin-qt has a corresponding private key.  There is no master key on bitcoin-qt.  
Look into Bitcoin Armory instead of bitcoin-qt.  It makes stuff like this a lot easier.  And it does have one master key for the whole wallet you can save.

Do you know how much a company like m-pesa charges East Africans to transfer money by phone?  Do you know how much money Africans lose to banks when they send remittances (and they send a lot of remittances)?  
Your average phone-owning African with funds to transfer stands to benefit a great deal from Bitcoin, in both money saved and convenience.
That said, I think an SIM-based version (like in JavaCard) of a Bitcoin wallet will need to emerge before most Africans can make use of it.

Here's how I explain it to my parents.  For our purposes, each Bitcoin has two addresses, ok?  A private and a public address.
You're almost certainly familiar with a bearer-bond Swiss bank account, right?  Like in Bourne Identity, where Matt Damon has a number embedded in a device under his skin?  Well, think of each Bitcoin address as a Swiss bank account and each private address as that Swiss bank account number.  Anyone who has that long string of numbers and letters can access the money in that address.  Those are the addresses that you want to keep very private and etch onto metal and hide.  Each wallet has hundreds of these addresses, many of which hold a positive balance.  
Anyway, with Armory, it's easy to store your private addresses offline and yet monitor them online (but not spend them).
With blockchain.info, it's a little trickier.  You can import "watch-only" Bitcoin addresses one-by-one.  If you've got all your funds on one address, then it's not a problem, but if you've got funds scattered across 50-100 addresses, it becomes trickier.  In that case, I'd send myself the funds I want to monitor to a single address.  And once you do "--dumpwallet" with pywallet, you'll be able to see the private key that corresponds to this public key.  Just be sure to keep that private key safe if you put a lot of funds on it!!  That's the one you'll want to etch onto metal.
So the answer to your question above is, "yes".  You'll be able to look up your balance using blockchain.info's watch-only import.

I'll echo the other two commenters here and say that most speculation would not be included in this figure, but I'll also explain why (for those who are new to BTC):  when you buy Bitcoin via an exchange like Bitstamp and Coinbase, that transaction doesn't show on the Bitcoin blockchain until you withdraw it.  
Well, most speculators keep the majority of the money the speculate with on their exchange accounts (since they need quick access).  And so it never shows up on the blockchain until they withdraw funds (relatively infrequently).

I suspect a lot of those looking into opening an exchange don't need financing at all.  The reason we needs banks is not necessarily for loans, but for access to the ACH / wire payment networks and checking/savings accounts.

I've been experiementing with btcd.  It's really clean code, and I've been impressed with Go.  Unfortunately, I've had several incidents where it blows up and starts consuming 99% processing on each of my 4 cores.  I've not been able to track down what's happening, but it's happened often enough that I don't feel comfortable running it unsupervised (and it's definitely btcd, it's right there on top).
I think btcd's got tons of promise, and it's a project I'd actually feel comfortable contributing to.  To be frank, I've been flat scared to contribute to Bitcoin-qt/bitcoind given my lack of expertise in C++ -- there's just so much room for error with C++, even though I understand the protocol pretty well and have even implemented parts of it in D and/or Lua.
But btcd is definitely still beta software, as I think Conformal would be the first to tell us.  Caution is warranted.  I suspect in another year it will be a very solid program, perhaps even more reliable and maintainable than bitcoind.

This a thousandfold.  If the OP does come from a reputable family of bankers and uses his own name, that will help alleviate some of the trust issues (although there may well be other issues because of the banking connection).  However, anyone thinking about doing this would be well-served by teaming up with an established, trusted member of the Bitcoin community.  Any newcomer/outsider will always be looked at with suspicion because of the high number of scammers and con artists who have come into the Bitcoin community and stolen large numbers of BTC.
Related to that, if the OP is thinking of doing this, it would be a good idea to create and learn how to use a PGP key, if you don't already know.  Use it for all of your important messages if you decide to pursue this idea.  So many people impersonate others that this technology is highly-values among the community.
But I think it's an excellent idea, and I would definitely use and help to establish such a bank were a trusted, knowledgeable person to lead the way.

Apologies if you're joking, but if not, please don't even start with the tainted coins idea.  It destroys one of Bitcoin's most important properties: fungibility.

It was the latter -- as I mentioned above, the puzzle gets easier to solve if there are less miners trying to solve it.  It self-adjusts.  This is how Satoshi was able to collect in the beginning so easily -- anyone who participated was able to do likewise, and there were several other people who also mined with Satoshi in the very beginning (including cryptographer Hal Finney, among several others).
But Satoshi was probably the only one who mined consistently in the beginning. And why wouldn't he?  It was his project, after all.  If he didn't mine when no one else was, the project would collapse.

We've seen it happen happen time and time again over the past several years, including several times in the past two months, even.  The only difference this time is the number of new people in the market who, understandably, are not used to 20%+ price swings.  Unfortunately for them, their panic selling is our profit taking.

Someone with $100,000 probably just missed their last big chance to make significant profits mining with the end of Bitmain's recent group buy.  If you had invested your 100,000 with them a week ago, before they sold out, you probably would have broke even in about 45 days, and then made $1000 per day after that, which would decline approximately linearly until probably around $50-100 a day six months out (real guesstimate there).
Of course, if you find another similar deal in coming weeks, you'll make similar returns.  But Bitmain was the only vendor I'm aware of who had major stock in recent weeks.  The return on the next-gen mining equipment 2-3 months out from shipping is so unpredictable as to be extremely risky.

It is true that transactions can sometimes take tens of minutes to become confirmed. Despite this, retailers can accept unconfirmed transactions with very little risk by simply 'listening' on the network for a double-spend transaction, or partnering with a company that provides this service. After a head start of merely several seconds, the original transaction would reach so much of the Bitcoin network that a fraudulent double-spend transaction would almost certainly be fruitless. An attacker would have to commit easily-detectable fraud, in person, several hundred or several thousand times, before one of these low-value double-spend attempts would likely succeed.

It's the beginnings of a new implementation of bitcoind, the original Satoshi Bitcoin software.

Yes, but for people with large sums of Bitcoin, this is a critical need.  No one with a lot of Bitcoins should be storing them on an online wallet or on a computer connected to the Internet.  You should use the offline signing capabilities of either Armory (Beginner or Advanced) or Electrum(Advanced*).  Your present alternative is to buy a cheap laptop and use it for offline signing, or else wipe (very!) clean an old computer by thoroughly wiping its harddrive.  And then it's a little bit of a pain to transfer coins from offline wallet to online wallet.
This kind of handheld offline signer has the potential to make this process much easier.

FINCEN (the U.S. financial transfer regulatory body) considers Bitcoin a legitimate currency.  Go read their advisory paper, which is quite explicit that they consider Bitcoin a currency.
The U.S. court system considers Bitcoin to be a legitimate currency -- there have been several judgments backing this up recently.
More importantly, after using Bitcoin for routine purchases without a hitch for several years, *I* consider Bitcoin to be a legitimate currency. 
Do you not?

Do you all have any recommended sites/links where I can learn more about self-replicating automated factories, micro-manufacturing, etc.?  Thanks!

This 100%.  It's called regulatory capture, as I'm sure you know:
Our political system is ridden with it, perhaps more than any in history.

Read the FAQ.  He's got that one covered.  A pin is required in addition to the number.

Yes, but please note that most Bitcoin programs are encoding more than just the address in the QR Code.  They usually precede the address with "bitcoin:", as such:
But it can be as complex as something like this:

Yes, and the next best defense is establishing our *own* parallel banking system, with our *own* clearing house.  So we will no longer need to use banks, even when dealing with fiat.
And it's pretty clear from the Coinbase fiasco that based on our current regulatory structures, trying to open a nationwide exchange is a hopeless cause.  It's overwhelming to any small start-up trying to satisfy customers and regulators alike with such growth as we've experienced.
We need to have an alliance of state-based exchanges, each knowledgeable and responsible for appeasing that state's regulatory bodies, and dealing with the local politicians in an attempt to get the regulators off our backs.
All would still have to be FinCEN-compliant, but that's getting easier to do with some of the services now coming online like blockscore.com

It's totally OK.  I'm in the U.S. and use Bitstamp successfully, who are located in Slovenia.


Nope, that's a big no-no according to Uncle Sam (alas!).  In fact, that's basically what Mt. Gox got into so much trouble about.  Actually, just opening the account would be OK, but specifically letting people deposit and withdraw from that account, especially if you don't have a specific arrangement with the bank (they'll never give it) and comply with multi-million dollar money transmitter licensing in each state where you have customers, you're screwed.  And that's why the situation still sucks.

Why is this upvoted to the top?  Do you people never do ACH or wire transfers?  It's never exactly X days.  It varies, often by a couple of days or more.

You can always include the algorithm and code along with the paper wallet, along with instructions on compiling if you wish.  Even if they can't do it themselves, they can hire a trustworthy programmer to compile the program for them and send them an executable (just be sure not to send them the private key, too).  
But having to resort to this is really the absolute worst case scenario.
Everyone is pretty much on board with BIP38, so unless some big weakness is found, it will likely become and remain the standard for a long time to come.

Yes, it has an RPC interface that aims for 100% compatibility with bitcoind, including the raw transaction API.  I haven't yet tried the raw transaction functionality, but it's available.  Just know that btcd is still early beta (0.3).

Yes, that could help you to establish your identity.  But you'll still need to register your nick with Freenode and then associate a signing key (either GPG or Bitcoin) with that nick.  A lot of people on  particularly the bigger traders, won't do business with someone who hasn't verified him/herself through their known signing key.

Thanks!  I don't want to publicize it just yet, but if you know of a specific merchant who is interested in Bitcoin up there, I'd be happy to come up there and set them up.  My Mom's family is from Asheville and I still have an aunt and uncle and several cousins in the area, so it would be a good excuse to visit.
What's the Bitcoin scene up there like now?  Are there any brick and mortar merchants accepting them?

Is there an echo in here?  Just because I didn't use words like URI or protocol prefix (or one you didn't mention: query string), doesn't mean I didn't include the exact same info you did.

You realize an originating address *is* a unique ID, right?
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:34:58
That's what I thought, but apparently lots of new people are making brain wallets, which require you to import addresses into bitcoin-qt.  Already several people have reported losing significant coinage because of this.

When you're setting up 2FA, click the "show me the key" link below the QR code.  Print that link out (don't save it on your computer) and store it in a safe location.
*Then* you can scan the QR code.
Gmail let's you print out a whole set of backup keys.  But for other sites that do 2FA, you'll need to manually copy and paste that key as I describe above.

If you're a multimillionaire, then you really shouldn't care about Bitcoin (unless you want massive returns on your investments, or you wish to evade your local tax obligations).  As a multimillionaire, you're part of the system, and the system works for you.
Bitcoin was designed for all the people whom the system *isn't* working for.  That includes most lower- and middle-class people in most countries.  For them, Bitcoin has the potential to make banking *much* easier, with no more $35 fees every time your goddamn balance slips under $0.  No more wondering why the hell you could pay your electric and grocery bills with your salary 5 years ago, and now it's such a struggle.  
If you're an immigrant, Bitcoin makes remittances a snap.  If you're a freelance translator, writer, or other struggling freelancer working for an overseas company on contract, no more $25 wire fees each time you're paid a couple of hundred bucks for a job.
For those same people, Bitcoin also holds great promise since it has the potential to weaken the current system, which as I've described above does not work for us.

I really like the fact that if you use 2-factor in campbx, you can't withdraw Bitcoins without entering your 2-factor code.  That's a nice extra check that should offer significant protection against things like cross-site scripting. 
And yes, campbx's founder is a real nice guy.  I just hope he doesn't have the bank breathing down his back soon.  He's been in business since 2011 so presumably he has some kind of arrangement with his bank.  But who knows?

Uh, regenerates his keys using his etched in metal backup?  And puts that on another old computer?

Huge potential savings for companies paying multiple overseas freelancers, since payment wire payment to parties outside of Europe can run $15+ per transaction, plus whatever fees the recipient pays (in the US, this can be as much as $30+ per transaction).  Instead, each transaction is pennies.  And if you're a small company, you don't even need to set up a special system for this -- just use the regular Bitcoin client plus QuickBooks or whatever accounting system you already use.
