They can use Abra also, then cash out to major banks in the Philippines. I find Abra better as their BTC rates are closer worldwide rates.
Coins.ph is known nationwide.

Monero is exception.

BTC as a SoV can't be underestimated specially in the Philippines, my savings has lost value for years now until when I switched to BTC. Peso looses value to USD overtime,  thus its a huge gain for Filipinos if our savings are in BTC as USD is loosing to BTC.

Maximum transfer I did before was 2K USD (per transfer), I used it before to buy BTC, until I got my Bitstamp account.
My friend told me Coins.ph rates equalized with Abra once BTC rates stabilizes (in few days after a major rate move).
Check this link:
Have them check the fees if its fine, I believe Abra also now supports ETH and moving to support Segwit? (not sure about this now).

Salamat po, but I won't cash out anytime soon, maybe by 2020 if I need to buy something or I quit my job.

Looking at the chart, its similar to the BTC-USD, it could be overextended and could crash back down.

Bitstamp user here... verification took a long time for me (1-2 months), but once verified these guys are the best exchange right now.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:22:10
Agree ;) Thank you for your input, good to know.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:07:11
You guys are wise :) you are spreading your investments, my only investment is land and crypto.

It's BCash dude, Bitcoin Cache is Lightning Network (LN).

Filipino here, started BTC when it was 400 USD, I'm still adding until now as I only took it seriously when it was at 2400 USD.

Try Abra you can cash out to major banks in Philippines.

I'm buying more on this dip as well! ;) Bought bitcoin back in 2016 ;)  
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:13:25
Matagal na po, 1 BTC almost 1M php na. I think marami pinoy BTC millionaire na as I knew some people talking about it back in 2013.

Bitstamp user here for about 1 month, the best exchange bar none - I still suggest people apply to all other exchanges as backup.

This dude is a scammer.

Same here, uninstalled mycelium way back and told all my friends to remove it.

Wow! This is great, lots of use case for this ;)

I wish we crash 30% more so all the shitcoins are cleared from the system.
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:43:39
Boycott them.
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:45:11
Avoid them like a plague. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 08:00:31
As a Bitcoin holder (very small amount) my timeframe is around 5 to 10 years. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:20:41
Wtf congratz!!!!
@_date: 2018-03-20 05:02:27
LN can replace almost all alts now, its more decentralized than alts. Once other layer 2 solutions come it will wipe 100% of existing alts.

I love your shop ;)

We need to create foundation to support them and have people donate. The more commits/ideas contributed the larger the incentive. We can also have a fund a dev activity/etc.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:12:05
100% agree, only when you need to.
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:06:22
I lost my trust on this wallet now and tell my friends to remove it and use Samourai instead. AVOID IT IF YOU CAN.
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:27:41
Pls send some sat!
