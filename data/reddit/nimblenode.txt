Yes, the total Bitcoin supply is based on the diminishing block rewards; every 4 years the block reward cuts in half. It started out at 50 BTC per block, then 25, now it's 12.5, soon to be 6.25 (estimated May 2020) and so forth.  
It's designed so that after 64 halvings there will be no more rewards, however based on the math, after the 32nd halving the block reward will be less than one satoshi, generating zero reward.  
So by around the year 2,140 the Bitcoin supply will be 20.999 million, no more Bitcoin will be created, miners will only earn transaction fees, and we'll all probably be dead.

Yes, pretty much spot on. A pruned node verifies blocks from genesis up to the current chain tip, then throws away previous block information (except unspent UTXOs). A pruned node is the same as an archival node in all regards except new nodes can't sync from it. Pruned nodes still perform full validation on every new block that comes in, and you can route transactions directly from your node.  
Very beneficial to the network since you're participating in consensus and verifying against the same consensus rule set as other nodes!

Satoshi! It's your cousin Marvin! Marvin Nakamoto! You know that p2p currency you're looking to build? Well, look at this!

With that being said, nimbleNODE provides the ability to run a pruned Bitcoin node that is easily controllable through a mobile app. Allowing you to participate in consensus while doubling as a hardware wallet in which you can send from your phone that sends commands directly to your node. [
