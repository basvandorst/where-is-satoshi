I think what he means by this is the fact that many merchants offer a discount if you buy in Bitcoin. If so, then it would be a "no brainer" to take that discount and replace the BTC with the dollars you were going to use to buy the product.

Why does it matter what the overall value of his wealth is denominated in? If it goes down he is taking a loss.

Came here to say this. I don't know why OP is worried about it. Its a non-issue.
@_date: 2014-01-20 04:43:46
I happen to agree (somewhat) with your opinion on Andreas Antonopoulos. However, your posts here are rife with self importance.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:02:42
This response is perfect. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:21:05
I say we form a club.

Hold on I think I know what you are asking. Are you worried that miners keep introducing new coins to the market and that is what is driving the price down?
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:03:30
I love what you are doing and I am a fan, but sometimes it sounds like you are trying to sell something to your audience. I'm not saying it needs to come from you however I think we could use some healthy skepticism in this space. 
I do think its awesome that you ask this question though.

Please refer to my first comment:D

You lose if something you have goes down in value. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:31:27
Do you find it frustrating that nobody can understand you?
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:31:35
Thanks, what is the street address?
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:03:34
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:58:17
I agree. As long as you keep it simple and build a habit of finishing projects. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:11:34
When you sell are you are doing is transferring value from one thing to another. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:01:24
I think the downvotes are coming in because you have a strange way of explaining yourself. Is English your first language? 
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:21:21
When your house dropped to 350k you didn't lose dollars you lost value.  
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:39:40
Aaaand we have gone full circle.
@_date: 2014-01-20 04:47:55
I will ignore nothing :D
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:43:07
Cool thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:06:39
You are one funny motherfucker. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 06:48:58
I love you both.
