Fuck that shit hahahahahah no way. If that's the solution, I'd really like to see Mr. Erdogan and his family convert all their overseas Dollars and Euros into TL. That would really save the economy because you have no idea how much they've stolen. :)

It's really easy, there are some Turkish exchange websites that offer up to 5-6 coins as well as Bitcoin. Sending money from the bank to the exchange takes a couple minutes. It's just a matter of realization at this point.

Dude I ain’t touching that with a 5 foot pole! I enlighten close friends and family. I leave the rest to non-TR citizens. Funny and tragic :)

Hello, I'm from Turkey. Around half of the population doesn't even recognize we're in crisis right now, so let's skip to the important part. The educated bunch already knew about Bitcoin and were trying to trade. Now they've come to realize it's much more convenient than holding TRY in centralized banks and they've started vocalizing this on forums and websites. Before threads about dollar exchange rates, there were threads about Bitcoin rates and people were sharing ideas and charts.  Now everyone is kind of busy trying to find a way to prevent losing money day by day, but it's still being mentioned on Dollar exchange posts. It's going to be difficult to spread the idea around because as I've mentioned, around half the population cannot be educated.

The exchange rate hasn't reflected onto the market yet. Wait 2-3 months and you'll start hearing unpleasant stories and the ignorant might wake up.

Banks already set high buy prices and risiculously low sell prices for USD and other foreign currencies. The difference is 0.50-1 TL and people will need another way really soon. A good social media campaign or something like that could help inform people about cryptocurrency.
