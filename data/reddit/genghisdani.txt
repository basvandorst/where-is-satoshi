Our CEO lives in New York and is involved with the company there, he just set up a branch here because he used to live here and wants to tap into the talent in this area.

Thanks. Since I live outside the US and only come back occasionally, I definitely qualify as an expat; I'll ask someone to look up if the $98k writeoff is valid, since by my calculations, I only make about $21k/year (part-time while I'm in college).

Can confirm. I work from Israel for a startup in New York that has yet to establish itself here. We tried PayPal for my first paycheck - never again. Took forever and they took a ton of money out. If it was a little easier to translate Bitcoin into Shekels where I live, I'd be paid like that in a heartbeat.

In theory, there should be no problem - as a US citizen, I work for the US-based company and pay US taxes. I just want to make sure I'm not screwing myself at all.

I'm not located in the States, but I am a citizen of both countries. Thanks for the link though, I'll give it a read.

Wow. That looks much easier than any of the methods I found 3 months ago.

Yeah sure, what the hell...

So true. I have a .com Monopoly game that I got in 2001. I haven't looked at it recently but last time I did, I remember that something like 75% of the sites had shut down.

Avast was unofficially recommended by my Software Security class teacher - I've already been using it for years, but that basically sealed the deal.

I think it might have been the coordinated multi-pronged attacks​ in Jerusalem around 2 years ago, but I'm really not sure. It's not particularly important, so it's not something I keep track of. Like you said: in general, lots of groups will claim attacks as their own (for the "honor" or whatever).

Not necessarily true. I think I recall a terrorist attack in Israel in the past couple years for which ISIS claimed responsibility.
