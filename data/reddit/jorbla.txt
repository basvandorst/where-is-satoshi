Yea, like I said above, the app never touches your username and password.  The initial setup for the OAuth2 authentication is done with a WebView and Coinbase's own website.  After that setup, the only thing stored is the access tokens.  Also, the app only requests permission to buy, sell, view balance, and view history, so it can't do things like transfer bitcoins to an arbitrary account.

Sure, I understand.  I have contacted them to try to get them to list the app on their page with 'Sample applications that use the API' ( and I'll let you know when that happens.

The money from bitcoin sales will get deposited in your bank account like normal.

Coinbase Exchange uses 3 legged OAuth2, since 2 legged is deprecated (as well as the old API key, as you mentioned).
And yea, it would be nice if Coinbase implemented the preconfigured image thing.  That would solve all of these trust issues.
I'll investigate if it's possible to authorize the app outside of the app itself (i.e. in your own web browser), but I'm not sure that will work.  I'll look into it more tonight.

I created an [Android app]( that lets you buy and sell on Coinbase like a stock exchange, if you want to check it out.

Yep. :)

Coinbase Exchange offers more functionality than Coinbase Trader and has a better interface, but you can compare them yourself. :)

When you authorize the app on the Coinbase website after you login, it will display a list of the permissions that the application is wanting.  So Coinbase Exchange is only asking for buy / sell / view balance / view history permissions, and those will be listed on the authorize page.

You all should check out an app that I published called [Coinbase Exchange](  It allows you to trade bitcoins on Coinbase like a stock exchange, and has more functionality and a better interface than the trader app.

Yea, the app uses the Coinbase API to add stock exchange-like functionality (limit orders, stop orders, etc), and helps you get better buy / sell prices without having to feverishly watch Coinbase prices.

Yea, its perfectly safe.  I'm the developer actually.  You can read the security section on the Google Play posting there: 
- Coinbase Exchange uses Coinbase's OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanism, which means that it does not store your Coinbase username and password, or even have access to it.
- Coinbase Exchange only requests permission to retrieve your BTC balance, view your buy / sell history, and perform buy and sell orders. It cannot transfer bitcoins to any other account or perform any other actions.
- All communication with Coinbase is encrypted using HTTPS, so nobody can eavesdrop and steal your information.
What are your concerns?  If you're concerned about someone stealing your username and password, the app uses a WebView to display the actual Coinbase login pages.  At no point is my code ever touching your username and password.  Once you've logged in and authorized the app, it uses OAuth2 authentication ( to login to Coinbase from that point on.  So, it is only ever storing access tokens, not your username and password.

Enabling the API key and authorizing an app to perform certain functions with your account are two different things: 
I have heard some compromises when enabling the API key + secret functionality (which I think have been fixed), but the app uses Coinbase's OAuth2 functionality, and it's only authorized to buy / sell / view balance / view history.

I'm the developer, and yes the app is trustworthy.  This [FAQ]( page addresses the common security / trust questions.  If you have any other questions, please let me know.
