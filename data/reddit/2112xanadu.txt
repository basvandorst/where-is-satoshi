A better analogy would be that we're in a world war with other countries using similar technology, who either already have a bigger room or already have faster tech. Do we want to wait, research, and invest more time in such a scenario?

If you think going from 90%+ to 35% in crypto dominance, or going from sub-penny fees to unknown double digit dollar fees is "how technology actually gets developed and improved upon", I've got a Waterfront Arizona Property ICO to sell you.

My brother did that with ETH. I wonder how much BCH will soak up the ETH buyers.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:57:48
Everyone that holds (like, actually holds) BTC now holds BCH whether they want it or not, and it's proving to have significant worth, so it's very relevant to @_date: 2017-08-04 04:13:57
Fair point. So it's actually been much better than a stock split, thus far. Regardless, I still don't understand why anyone is upset about free money. Money&gt;Politics in my book

Dilution means you have a lower percentage than you did before, which isn't the case here. You hold the exact same percentage of the overall pie.

@_date: 2017-08-29 12:46:12
That doesn't really explain it, though. Derivatives aren't "fantasy money", because they aren't money at all. They're instruments, and Bitcoin has them as well--just look at any exchange with calls, puts, futures, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:48:33

Some people discussing a technical weakness in a software is not in any way proof of a coordinated "conspiracy". If someone actually were to put up the manpower, time, money, and resources necessary to carry out such a maneuver, I can guarantee they wouldn't be posting it publicly on some tiny subreddit.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:13:24
I thought the entire idea of open source software was that *anyone* can make changes, and the market will follow the implementation it deems best. What does is matter "whose" product it is?

@_date: 2017-11-03 10:27:54
Where did this meme originate? Value doesn't just materialize, and certainly when we're talking about what is essentially a software protocol, usefulness is kind of a primary determinate of worth. If Bitcoin isn't supposed to be money, then it isn't valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:17:42
I agree that claiming "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" is wrong, but I also tend to feel that anyone who can't figure out the difference between the two shouldn't be buying either one.

I've yet to see any proof beyond speculation that any of that took place, and even if it did, there's a few assholes in every single organization or group you could ever name. It doesn't justify blanket animosity, and it won't fix anyone's problems.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:11:34
You know what's better than either one? Being happy with what you have and support and not gloating over others' losses.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:47:43
I understand it's a competitive strategy, and to an extent it feels like a zero sum game right now. I don't believe this to be the case, though, and the fact that the market cap has more than tripled since the chain split would seem to support that argument. It's entirely possible for both coins to have success moving forward, and even if BCH turns out to be a failed experiment, there's a large contingency of well-meaning people who believe in larger blocks and deserve the right to see that experiment through. Treating the other side as sub-human enemies is far more damaging to the crypto community than chain splits.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:22:02


Please explain.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:59
You could just as easily make the opposite argument: second-layer solutions are fallible, so let's get the blockchain right so we don't have to put trust in fallible companies.

Currencies don't have market caps, but they do have monetary supplies (measured in M1, M2, and M3). Exchange rates really don't apply to the issue of BTC's theoretical max value.

@_date: 2017-11-01 11:23:14
Yes, it would be expensive. Yes, this does seem like a major loss in potential usage value. No, I can't understand how anyone is fine with saying "oh well just let them use a different coin for Amazon purchases. Not like that's a big market or anything".
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:45:07
Oh okay, guess I should have known to go look all those up. Seems like it should be pretty simple to explain how an open source adaptation is a "scam", but it clearly takes a plethora of sources.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:06:40
Completely wrong. You can buy any coin on Finex with tether, not just BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:33:11

Gold has significant and unique physical properties that make it useful and valuable in jewelry and industry (won't tarnish/degrade, very stable, excellent conductivity, highly malleable and ductile), not to mention the fact that it has been an accepted form of payment for millennia.

@_date: 2017-11-12 01:09:09
Assertions like these are naive and are damaging this great technology. I'm rooting for BTC, but having an asset that can't be transferred is like having a car you can't drive.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:03:09
Well I'm a longtime redditor who's held BTC longer than probably 95% of this sub, and I think this whole bcash thing is dumb as fuck. Useless distraction that only makes BTC look like a bunch of clowns.

I've usually seen guesses in the 1 to 2 million BTC range, but it's impossible to really know.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:39:13
At the end of the day, it's every investor's responsibility to do his own due diligence to understand what he's investing in and what the risks are. Period. With an open source software, anyone can make changes to the protocol and allow the marketplace to buy or sell it. Period.    
You may not like the competing software, and you're free to not buy it, use it, or support it. But pretending it's a "scam" because you dislike a different implementation of an open source project is childish and regressive.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:11:37
It's all good; wasn't directing anything toward you directly. I just see a lot more genuine animosity in the community these days and I'd really like to see some harmony restored.

Well, that's simply patently false. If you sold before this week, you took a major hit investment-wise. Pretend all you want, but them's the facts. Those of us who held both are better off right now, period.

I'm not a programmer, so I have no idea if you would ever do that or not. My understanding is that this quarrel is about blocksize. Larger block=more transactions per block. That seems like an increase in use/effectiveness to me. Now, if there are a host of bad side effects that come along with this benefit, I can also see why people would be against it. I'm just trying to see an objective cost-benefit analysis here.

I've been casually involved in Bitcoin for 4 years. If I feel this frustrated, I can only imagine how the beginner must feel. Not feeling optimistic at all right now. Literally can't ask questions on here or without accusations of "troll" "butthurt" "shitcoin" and other childish bullshit. It fucking sucks.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:44:39
How is it an "attack"? If it becomes the main chain, doesn't it simply become BTC? I don't understand why 1MB or 2MB makes that big a difference to anyone.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:10:25
I don't fully understand a lot of that, but thanks for your answer!
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:19:49
Yeah that's shady af no matter who you root for.
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:01:41
Right, but take Coinbase users: they can't buy or sell BCH if that's the only platform they use. So supply and demand are both stifled.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:09:36
Thanks for the sound advice, redditor for 2 days...

Then I would risk all the pennies. Some serious EV there.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:10:18
Ideally I'd love to see an objective-as-possible pros/cons evaluation on the entire S2X controversy, but I'm not optimistic.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:58:22
So, we didn't agree to Segwit either. Why was everyone (seemingly) so pumped about that first part of the agreement, and now so seemingly against the second half of that agreement?
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:23:16
I would genuinely love a sub for neutral hodlers who don't give a shit about the politics. Like, if BTC goes to zero, I'm good because BCH took its place; if BCH drops off the face of the earth, who cares? I didn't even know it existed 3 months ago.
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:57:34
I can't imagine it being worth the risk for whatever advantages Finex has over other options.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:18:59
How so?
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:51:54
1-2.) I don't know anything about this    
3.) I don't even know what "repo" means    
4.) I think I understand what a node is, but I don't know what camouflaging them means    
5.) Ok, I think I understand replay protection, but I don't see why it would matter since only one chain is likely to survive anyways    
6.) Testing sounds like a good idea    
7.) Clearly its contentious, so please explain your contention to laymen like myself instead of throwing around insults
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:48:40
Shorting doesn't contribute to net demand, though, since it's essentially a sell with a later purchase. In the short term it actually increases selling pressure since the sale comes first (from a borrowed coin).
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:01:48
You have to split BTC into BT1 and BT2 tokens. You can re-merge them before the fork if you want.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:22:41
Closer to 15 at this point.
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:02:49
But there was free BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:02:54
My understanding is that if core decides to go along with 2X, then the BT1 token would be considered the "winner".
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:38:33
What's the best exchange to move to?
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:10:22
Terrible analogy, and this is the exact kind of reactionary nonsense I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:28:11
Only Coinbase has that data, but I'd guesstimate something like 75-80% of their U.S. users don't use any other platform.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:25:01
I mean, if you can't figure out how to sell it you probably can't figure out how to buy it, so it seems like that situation would cut both ways, no?
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:05:00
In what way did the community and user base agree to the first half (Segwit) and not the 2x part?
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:40:53
You still need a platform for those types of transactions to occur. Not to say that someone can't do it cheaper than what exists, but someone still has to get paid as an intermediary to build/maintain the platform and ensure trust between users.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:48:29
Not at all. I'm either too stupid to understand this or I'm smart enough to realize that it's beyond my comprehension.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:00:34
I visit both subs regularly, where's my payout? But seriously, everyone hodling BTC has equal parts BCH unless they actively got rid of it, so most of us are risk neutral when it comes to one or the other. I wish I could find *any* objective source rather than the "is propaganda; is paid trash" nonsense I read constantly.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:53:49
It's literally feee money that I didn't have on July 31. If it goes up at BTC's expense, I'm even. If it goes to zero, I'm even. There's no way of having less risk than that.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:57:08
I mean, the good news is that everyone holding BTC now would have BTC S2X then, right? It's not as bad as, say, ETH coming in and somehow stealing all the market share and driving current BTC holders' balances to zero. 
    
I don't really understand the value of Segwit 1x vs. Segwit 2x though (isn't BCH already essentially 8x anyways? And it's less than a tenth of BTC's value).
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:39:37
Processing power is still processing power, regardless of rules. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:48:03
I guess I don't understand why miners would even be in favor of larger blocks. Wouldn't they make more money with small blocks where the transaction fees are higher?
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:05:59
I'd love a resource to understand this. This sub has certainly been zero help.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:28:17
That really doesn't answer my question though. Forced deal by whom? Are there literally *zero* benefits to the average BTC holder like myself? In any debate, it's very difficult for an outsider to believe that one side is 100% correct and the other side is 100% ill-intentioned, which is what the previous poster seems to be implying. I'm willing to accept that one side is unquestionably better than the other; I just haven't seen anyone making that case in a way that any average/layman user can get on board with.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:26:02
Poor us.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:21:00
Thank you for that clarification. I've been trying to figure out the differences and similarities between this potential fork and the Bitcoin Cash fork.
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:09:25
OP just do yourself a favor and delete this.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:34:48
87% of statistics on the internet are pulled out of someone's ass.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:25:00
$100 million per coin might be a tad optimistic.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:09:27
Exactly. Way too much advice on here acting like they know the future perfectly.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:21:03
So users are just going to start getting in cars with no way of trusting that the driver has been vetted or reviewed at all? People are going to send BTC and just hope that a seller actually sends their item, with no form of recourse if it's a scammer? I don't see those platforms being very popular.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:16:13
That's the way I read the contract. Obviously you'll want to do your own due diligence.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:47:04
My understanding is the because of the EDA, BCH can exist alongside BTC even while having the same PoW algorithm. S2X is different because there is no EDA, and thus only one can really survive regardless of which one it is. Correct? In which case replay protection is superfluous.
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:29:42
Opportunity cost and risk are not correlated concepts. Risk is your exposure to future changes in the market. If you are 100% certain that BCH will drop to zero, you can make a boatload of money by investing your entire fortune into short selling them. I'm guessing you haven't done that, however, because it would be.... *risky*
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:24:04
Username checks out.
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:28:20
Basically just pulling it out of my ass, but I'd be surprised if 50% of people even knew how to access BCH, let alone sell them. We know that no one on Coinbase has sold any, and I'm sure we could look at the number of coins in wallets that haven't been touched since July 31 to get the absolute maximum.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:14:29
Ok, "unless they actively got rid of it *or acquired more*". Thanks for that important clarification. Don't call me a liar.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:14:18
Hadn't seen that before. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:27:29
But it's problematic for someone who wants to bet that 2X will happen in some fashion, but isn't willing to risk a Core agreement/postponement wiping out his stack because it didn't happen in the exact fashion and timeline dictated by the Finex contract.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:03:51
Someone is buying them, otherwise they'd be at zero.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:38:58
I appreciate your argument, but my understanding is that while there may be other SHA256 coins, there are none that come close to the required difficulty of BTC. The only reason, and I gather, that BCH even exists is because it contains the ability to lower its required processing power to a level that incentivizes miners to give a fuck. Within that paradigm, whatever and whomever can provide said processing power can pretty much continue to run the system... because they are the system.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:44:34
Snark aside, the obvious answer is that B2X is forking off the BTC chain, not the BCH chain.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:08:03
Surprised this hasn't moved the action much on Finex. Then again, with such low volume who can really tell.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:39:32
Yeah, something tells me WeedAndLsd knows something about keeping it on the down low.

Don't get why this sub is so against BCC. If it fails, who cares; if it succeeds, good for them? All these memes just reek of inferiority complex.
