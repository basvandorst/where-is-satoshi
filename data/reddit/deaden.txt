No, that's a flase analogy. Doesn't WU make almost all of their money off of things like transfer fees and money orders? Maybe I read something wrong, but when BTC users are asked what the benefits of a crypto are, the elimination of such fees and expenses is usually at the top of the list. That's like telling blockbuster to try (legally) selling torrents with instructions on how to find more, instead. It's not a different business model.  It's not a business model at all. Its supporting a system that empowers the individual and removes the foundation of their business. 
Am I missing something here?

Along with that (unless you bought BTC with cash in a dark alley somewhere), they can access your bank transactions and CC purchases if you use them to purchase coins. This includes the time of purchase, and the amount. They can gather more information from that than some might think.

Shh, he's euphoric right now. Let him believe everyone will immediately buy infantile, unstable, limited-use internet coins instead of just moving their money to a credit union, if just for a moment.

It checks out, I think.

I don't understand. Why would a company like this be interested in Bitcoin to begin with? It kinda goes against everything their business relies on, doesn't it?

I subbed to this subreddit to learn more about Bitcoin. And I have. But not before I had to wade through piles of nauseating, pretentious, naive bullshit.
It's like a lot of posters here live in some kind of alternate euphoric reality, and BTC is a perfect gift from a supreme being that will usher in an orgasmic utopia.
