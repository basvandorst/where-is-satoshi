I mean why not? Things only go up. /s

There is no intrinsic value. How dumb are you. There could be an intrinsic value when and only when it is an accepted currency. Right now it's all speculation. It has an attributed value but no intrinsic value with rapid growth. AKA a bubble. 
It really annoys me how dumb you are after trying to sound smart.

!remind me when this guy realizes he can't trade bitcoin for food during a depression.

Difficulty to acquire or rarity do not in themselves make something valuable, and it certainly does not make for rapid natural growth.

Established, i.e commonly used. I can not walk in to any store and pay in bit coins, I can with the established local currency, how fucking hard is that one to understand.
I did not speculate on how widely Bitcoin will be used, I explicitly stated that right now it is not. Any use in the future is pure speculation which makes this a fucking bubble for the 100th time. You are so god damn dense.

Probably because he got to hide there for years until rape charges against him were dropped.

You mean like the trends where Bitcoin has gone through several bubbles over the past few years?
I explained higher up why it's a bubble. It is experiencing rapid growth far above its intrinsic value. It has no intrinsic value because it is not a wide spread accepted currency. I don't give a fuck if you think it will be an accepted currency, because that has no fucking impact on the here and now.
Someone ought to hit you upside the head with an economy textbook.

Only parts of the truth that benefit him.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:03:13
Because when an economy crashes you don't go to a highly volatile currency, lmao.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:43:55
It is a bubble and you'd be dumb to think otherwise. Your attitude is much like what led to the GFC. Houses aren't a bubble, why would houses be a bubble, you're dumb if you think houses are a bubble. Ohhhh shit the economy. I thought things could sustain rapid growth forever.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:07:53
You keep talking about things being worked on, things in the future, that is speculation. You ask a question, you get answers you don't like, and you go off on a tangent.

It displays the characteristics of a bubble. It's a semi useless object undergoing rapid growth with a lot of people  investing in it so they can sell it for more usable currency.
At this point Bit coin is not a currency, it is an investment item. It is only being invested in because it's going through rapid growth for no logical reason. Very much a bubble.
You can make all the memes you want about holding it forever until it's a usable currency, but when a large part of your base is just buying it to increase their wealth in USD, it only takes a small scare to shit on everyone.

You are the stupidest motherfucker lol. I read your comments throughout the thread, you have no fucking idea what you're doing. For your sake, I hope you didn't blow your life savings on BTC, because you come across as someone that is trying to justify a shitty decision. 
Can you make an update thread when you're homeless?

Hey, I've been a redditor a little over 2 days, which coffee shop can I spend bitcoins at?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:10:42
The dollar is established and widely accepted which gives it value, Bitcoin does not have that. Some day it might, but today it doesn't, making this a bubble.
No one is buying up US currency hoping that it appreciates in value.

An economic bubble or asset bubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value.
10 seconds of Googling shows I was using it completely correctly, what a shocker that a bitcoin guy is economically retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:15:28
Lets point to Zimbabwe, a country that has always made sound economical decisions. LOL.
Besides you know they aren't mining BC to use BC right? They're using it to convert to USD, the actual useful currency.

This is your (and this subs) problem right here. You put the cart before the horse. WHEN it is established, it is not currently. Which makes this rapid growth a bubble.


Holy shit are you willfully blind to history? A lot of people rode the housing bubble, and a hell of a lot of people lost a lot of money. You're making my argument for me man. Is the entry requirement for bitcoin to be completely ignorant of both history and economics?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:51:07
Hey, just reminding you early.

Sued and lost.

No meaningful amount of transactions.

Bubbles happen. Give it a few weeks and you can rotate this gif 180 degrees.

I wouldn't be taking any advice from that dude, he's fucking bonkers.
