You know it. But I will treat myself to some top class scotch and international vacations, donate some, and buy into Initial Coin Offerings.

I know its useless. My actions are derived more from superstition than logical action at this moment of palpable excitement. I lock my wallet in safe deposit box when I'm not looking at it.

I knew this was going to be big when I saw the series and visualized the potential of the summations to switch from logarithmic to exponential growth.

I'm a man who doesn't hold back.

nope, you do whatever you want to. I got in early, I can't sell you that.

In an Aristotelian society a visionary politician is a figurehead for the nation-soul, a man whose own consciousness is in sync with the political manifestations of the subconscious and conscious desires of the nation, both as a race and as a metaphysical geo-entity, to shed the weight of their burdens and rise and claim their rightful inheritances and soil. Only a man who is unburdened by the intellectual burdens of marxism, delusions of equality, and the restricting nature of burdensome social connections and political correctness would be able to emerge as such a strong leader.
Christianity has built the foundations of the nation, and the free enterprise that has led to bitcoin. It has defeated the antagonisms of marxism-leninism,  collusion and takeover, and threats from violent societies to guide this nation to conquest and the right moral latitude. That's deserving of credit. 
But there exists an easier way for you to think of it. Have you heard of Pascal's Wager?

I'll have to pay taxes right?
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:08:54
I will donate some to worthy causes.

What do you think?

I don't care. There's probably thousands of new millionaires today.

I'm actually terrified to take a screenshot or accidentally share anything that can be used against me.  It feels unreal. I'm paranoid of everything right now, I made sure my computer is plugged in with cables connected twice. I put a fan over my hardware wallet. I do not show anything outeardly and do not trust anybody.  Everything needs to be perfect.
