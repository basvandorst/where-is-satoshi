A $100 Amazon Gift Card costs $97 technically. Gyft returns 3% back to you.

Quite high for whom? The soda people whom the public couldn't give less of a fuck for?

Your account has been IP banned. You will lose all your Bitcoins. I've seen this happen before.

Looks like you got ripped off:

Just a question, but are you keeping the Bitcoins or immediately liquidating them?

Oh, so now Tiger Direct is selling their stuff for the price that every other company is selling for, except only to Bitcoin customers?

Why do we insist so much on mBTC? Why not cBTC? If people see $618, they'll stray away because it's worth too much. If they see $.0618, they'll just assume it's worthless.

So then, will I benefit from this and not get arrested?

Finally, something to benefit all Bitcoin users.

How much would it cost you to make customer wristbands where one could put their QR code?

Those businesses aren't incurring the cost, so I don't see what your point is. If I go to a vending machine and pay with Bitcoin, I as the consumer have to pay up more. You're talking about businesses making up for THEIR costs with the new potential Bitcoin/Credit Card customers and not about the costs the consumer has to take. Of course a business wouldn't care, but when my soda is no longer $.75 but $.84, we have a problem. You might say I must be really poor to have that 9 cents as a concern, but the way the media would report this or the way people would digest it is like this:
"Wait, I can pay 75 cents with my debit card...or 84 cents with Bitcoin...yeah, I think I'll stick to my debit card"
or rather, why pay with Bitcoin where I get a cost (9 cents) when I can just pay with my debit card and the company gets the cost?

They have been here for years already. Have you been living under a rock?

Its ok but expensive. Lets just say I'd rather eat at Cheesecake Factory.

This wouldn't really work because whenever a Bitcoin transaction is done, there needs to be paid a miner fee of roughly 9 cents. People would not want to pay an extra 9 cents, when they can just swipe their debit cards for free.

Buy Bitcoin and hold it. The time to double your money within the span of a month is over, but if you hold it for years and years - well, then...
TO THE MOON!
