By definition of a Ponzi scheme, it's not one and it weakens your augmentation but it does share many similarities with it though.

You can do that with exchanges trading in Tethers though lmao

Are you referring to perfectly elastic demand then or overall nonsatiation, which is about preferences and not demand then?
You're argument is auto-referring, it doesn't make much sense ; the problem is that we can practically have blocks a bit larger and off chain scaling at the same time which will fix today's issues. It doesn't mean that fix will be repeated forever.

I don't understand how it allows for control of the network, how would one do that?
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:43:38
Great! Good luck for the future, take care.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:14:33
Alright then we'll not agree on "infinite demand".
I said your argument is auto-referring in the sense that your argument about bigger blocks refers to itself to prove itself. E.g : bigger blocks create opportunity for more intensive applications, demanding bigger blocks, again and again. 
This is not what I am saying, I am saying that this time, in this particular case, we'll need bigger blocks at some point, maybe 8MB, we're not talking 1GB. Maybe every ten years or twenty years blocks will have to become larger because there are so many transactions and technology then will make the choice available for everyone and not only the supercomputers.
 Then there's off-chain scaling such as segwit and we'll probably have to rely more and more on off-chain scaling because of how large the chain has become.
We shall see what tech prevails anyways
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:46:22
You're right, but let's just say it's not common for people to move so young and because I didn't want to assume OP's situation, I shared the least problematic situation I could think of. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:52:43
Guys this look like bait as fuck...
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:41:51
That's not what I am saying. I am saying there is a fix we can use now to a problem we have now. I'm not saying this needs to be repeated *ad nauseam* nor is it the only answer available. We can use larger blocks, we can use off-chains settlements, we can look at new technologies and protocols and maybe adapt them to the Bitcoin blockchain. Also demand is simply not infinite, that's not a correct statement. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:38:54
Why not let the technologies compete against one another? I'm not a believer of the "market will sort it out" because there are so few developers, few exchanges and the market isn't that big for a currency that aims to become global. But I think we should look at our options and fix the issues, improve upon the past with what we know now. Better than doing *nothing* and just wait for a technology that doesn't exist yet to fix today's problems.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:12:19
and segwit would accelerate that process?
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:14:53
But blocks were smaller back when the Bitcoin blockchain started, so when is too big or when are we supposed to keep having bigger blocks? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:25:58
Wtf the advice here is terrible, he or she is 16, that's not the time to tell your parents to fuck off, plus, what kind of relationship building is that? Not everything has to be a confrontation. Sit down with your parents and give them the relevant information, bitcoin is an Internet, technological and popular currency that you traded and got money for. Give them the relevant information, find easy youtube videos that explain what happened, like [this one]( On Coinbase, there are links to known neswpapers such as [here]( and [here]( If they really don't understand, try to find a peer-2-peer technology they can relate to or find an example with movies, phone calls, mails. 
You'll still be living with your parents for a while, respectfully explain what's going on, tell them you're ready to explain and show how it works and that it is legit. You can also go on the [Securities and exchange commission website]( and show that Coinbase is a registered and legit company. 
[Here]( is a recent article about their funding.
I hope it will help, good luck.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:42:22
The video is great but it obviously points at really big blocks and to fix high fees and congestion, I don't see a problem with making the blocks a few MB larger while looking for other solutions such as Segwit or other off chain settlements.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:45:17
You make a good point, I was refering to people telling him/her to tell the parents to fuck off or just tell them off because it's your money and stuff like that. The metaphor you used is great, I hope it'll help OP, luckily my parents are younger and actually tried to understand what it is even though they don't understand the tech, they can get behind the idea.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:01:59
There is a short term problem : high fees and congested network, so it requires a solution which is larger blocks, doesn't have to be huge but big enough to help. Also, I said in my comment that I don't have a problem with off chain scaling but it's extreme to want one solution and only one to fix all the problems. There will be a need to adapt to different problems with different solutions. On/off chain scaling, larger blocks, mix of incentives to align users' and miners' goals, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:44:21
On a purely theoretical point of view, your question is about [elasticity]( it's measurable to some extent but in practice it can vary and only be witnessed in hindsight.
There's an interesting question, that is : how much would you regret a move you didn't make, what the cost of regret? This has been a lingering question in behavioural economics, maybe [this article]( can be of some use. 
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:04:58
Alright, fast forward, I'm not 5 anymore. What are the technical pros and cons, security benefits or issues, (dis)incentives, etc. With Segwit?
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:29:58
One can hope for it

Currencies are backed by trust and that's pretty much it, funny one would think they have an "intrinsic" value.

i don't know if that counts as a win :D

Hope this post does well on both subs
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:04:38
As I said on the on the other sub, I feel like I'm on 9gag sometimes with the memes and people hating on each other (both subs involved), there are a lot of wtf moments. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:18:33
I don't know man but it could be, it sounds too stupid to be true
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:07:20
Look, I'm asking on a Bitcoin dedicated sub where people are involved with the tech and are users of the tech what they think about a change in it. It seems like a good place to do so, where I can get a wide variety of opinions and advice and talk to "real" people who follow the tech.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:00:00
You're saying that because bigger blocks call for more intensive usage, it'll spiral up to huge blocks (which shouldn't be, we agree there) and that because it'll spiral up, we shouldn't have bigger blocks.
I'm not saying we should leave it untested, I'm not a proponent of an ideoligical war like there's now between BTC and BCH. But 8MB is a totally understandable scaling debate to have in my opinion. 
Again, I'm not saying this must be the only way to fix or scale the chain, it simply will be part of the process of scaling, with many other tech available. 
I'm also not relying on tech that doesn't exist, I'm exactly counting on a very slow growth of processing power, that's why I chose that interval of 10 or 20 years. It will be part of the solution, not the only solution. Where I stand, people expecting off-chain scaling to resolve all the problems at once and have gigantic throughput, are the one relying on a yet not existent tech.
What I'm saying is that this time, we can increase blocks size which must be tested ofc, it's easy to do and that with off-chain scaling (which is still limited) we can achieve a sound chain.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:09:19
I'm mostly trying to get different opinions to understand the whole debate better here, thanks anyways. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:55:58
What's with the deflection? Instead of thinking that everyone is against you, maybe it's time to actually look at the problems and address them? It's not a question of "sides" but actually do something about it? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:36:28
You should probably go through the [white paper]( first. Then, what's probably interesting for you to look at is the [cryptography]( behind Bitcoin. You might also want to read about the hashing function [here]( and [here]( which explains how bitcoin works.
If you're ready to delve into more details, there's a complete course about [bitcoin and cryptocurrencies](
I hope you'll find it interesting, good luck.

When you think about it, some flavours of communism implied that it was the natural finalization of capitalism. Because it was to be expected that one company would be so far beyond its competitors that it would reach a 
 natural and almost unchallengeable monopoly situation. Some thought it was the state's responsability to be that monopoly but it might as well be a company. We'll see who of the evil corporations or the rogue AI's get us first.
