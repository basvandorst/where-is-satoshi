I agree, and I think I speak for more than a few of us when I'm say I'm tired of these Blockstream guys trying to keep bitcoin stunted so that they can roll out their own solution and then charge companies for their consulting and system integration services. They spread pure unsubstantiated fear, lies and doubt under the guise of "keeping the network safe". Reeks awfully of what politicians do. I don't trust them at all and I think it's time for the network to switch to Gavin and Mike's fork (who've always proven to have the network's best interest at heart) and leave the rest of them behind. This project is too important to be ruined by corruption, cronyism and a conflict of interests.
Gavin has provided lots of evidence, tests and simulations that support the block size increase. What have the Blockstream guys done besides yelling "This is never going to work but we're not going to provide any evidence as to why! LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU".

TLDR: passive-aggressive, anti-progress, statist "b buh but it wasn't approved by the government!1!!1" luddites calling themselves "futurologists" saying that Bitcoin is a failure and to be avoided.
I'll paste my comment from a similar discussion last week:
I find it hilarious actually - the people calling themselves "futurologists" thinking that game changing innovations will be announced by some committee of Nobel prize winners in a highly publicized research paper before being put in production. For someone who claims to study the past and the future, they are sure blind to the fact that virtually every technological game changer was a black swan event that no one could predict in foresight. They have a black swan sitting right in front of them right now, but since it hasn't been approved by a committee of PhD economists, it must be a ponzi scheme scam that's used only by drug dealers and terrorists.
It's a classic case of epistemic arrogance - usually a product of overedumacation (this system routinely creates overeducated idiots who are completely disconnected from how the world really works and who think that innovations come from a bunch of economists sitting in their ivory towers. Laughable.)

My experience with non-technical people in this line of work is that they often don't have the capacity to understand abstractions and complex technical matters, so they tend to blame developers for their inability to correctly and coherently reason about said matters. Often though, they oversimplify things in an attempt to understand things better, and end up creating a false representation of what's really going on. Then they lash out in anger, blaming "those autistic nerds".
If you're unable to speak the language of a certain trade, craft or business, then it's not the fault of the people working in those fields. It's more likely that you should look for a job elsewhere, preferably doing something you don't find as taxing.

You are creating a false dichotomy here by claiming that we have to choose between living in the state of nature or submitting to a society that extracts labor out of its young people by force. There are plenty of rich, civilized, socially and technologically advanced societies that don't do that. Don't believe me? What about Japan, Canada, Australia, the UK etc? Are these people living in that "alternative" that you speak of?


If I come to your house with a gun, show you a piece of paper wherein I've decided that you need to work for me for a year, and threaten to lock you in a cage if you don't, what's that called again? What's the difference between one individual doing and the state doing it? What is the numerical threshold of perpetrators that we need to exceed to legitimize such acts? Is the state somehow exempt from the moral rules that bind individuals? Do you realize how dangerous this line of reasoning is, and the kind of atrocities that ended up occurring in the past because we let the collective get away the exact things we punish individuals for? Keep in mind that a ton of atrocities happened in the past in the name of "the greater good".
Who are you to decide what qualifies as the greater good? Who gave you the right to take away a person's liberty - an inalienable natural right?
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:49:56
Don't expect anything. Most people are unintelligent and incapable of correct logical reasoning. They routinely fall for the hindsight bias and think that game changers (they primarily jerk off to "singularity") will be readily obvious in foresight and that they will have ample time to jump on board that train. But when such a train does appear, they denigrate and mock it. Human stupidity has no limits.

If we start taking away people's natural rights - life and liberty - when expedient, where do we draw the line? Do you realize how dangerous this line of reasoning is and how destructive is to our civil liberties, and the society at large (the one you're so obsessed about protecting)? Once you cross the line of negating a person's right to spend their time however they see fit (i.e. take away their freedom), where does it stop? Do you realize that every totalitarian regime in the history started out that way, "for the benefit of the collective?"


YOU CAN'T DO IT BY FORCE. Soviets tried it that way and they failed. It just DOESN'T WORK. History has proven as much. Charity needs to be voluntary, and if it not possible to get enough volunteers, then fund it with taxes and social security. Forcing people to do it and threatening them with force will just create resentment and make them hate the very people they're supposed to help.

I ask myself this very question every day. Almost everything good and free has been regulated out of existence, and only those toeing the societal/collectivist party line seem to get anywhere in life nowadays. It's almost as if a group of people wants to enslave all of mankind, remove our ability to live outside the system, and make it impossible to survive on our own without their technocratic blessing. This is manifest in everything from the education system, to how we raise our children, to how we earn our living and put food in our stomachs. There's no escaping it and even living in the wilderness isn't truly possible anymore, since every square inch of every piece of land on Earth is accounted for and monitored 24/7 and covered with a thousand conflicting laws, bylaws and regulations. I remember a situation a few years ago when a guy tried to live in the woods and subsist by fishing in a mountain stream, and he promptly ended up getting arrested and charged for fishing without a license. You can't even put food in your stomach without their permission anymore.
What bothers me the most is that it's virtually impossible to fight back. Sure they have guns, but that's not nearly as scary as the fact that they have the near unanimous consent of virtually everyone. Tyranny is getting worse and worse every day, and if you dare speak up, expect those closest to you to put you back in line and tell you to watch it. Political indoctrination, stupidity, childish naivety and an inability to engage in rational thought reign supreme. I sometimes feel like it's hopeless. If humanity doesn't destroy itself completely, it'll end up getting completely enslaved under the rule of a few ruthless individuals who were smart enough to work the democratic system and twist it in their favor and change it into something else.

You didn't manage to refute anything I said. But nice attempt to move the goalposts.
Look, you sound like a guy who's had a hard life, maybe a bad start in life. I'm no shrink and don't want to play one, but you sound like someone who was hurt by the world, and now you're trying to pay it back by making people do what you want them to do. But it's not the way man. If we want to live in a free and open society, we need to take responsibility and keep going in the face of failure. Collectivism is an attractive and cheap way to quickly feel powerful by siding with the collective (and what's why many weaklings and losers resort to it), but it's not the right way. It leaves us worse off in the end. Just say no to such things.
I hope you can find a way in life to achieve what you want without asking others to commit violence on your part. I'll leave you with that.

Correction: any balance from the same **unspent output**, not an address. An address might contain coins from multiple outputs and you may be spending only a single output.

So if this particular miner wants to run what they're running, they're absolutely free to do so.

Block space is *not* expensive, because Bitcoin is a unique, one of a kind, censorship resistant, fully sovereign, antifragile, inflation-proof, taxation-resistant store of value with no alternatives for what it does best. If you think these 10-30 cent fees are too high, I really don't know what to tell you. No other asset in the world can do what Bitcoin does, so paying a few cents for the right to have your value transfers recorded immutably and permanently for all times is not too much. Bitcoin is *not* Paypal/Visa/Venmo and shouldn't  try to compete with them.


And what exactly, pray tell, do you think an increase to 2MB is going to do? Get us twice the userbase? Let's say it does. What then? Nothing changes substantially, and we would still need orders of magnitude bigger blocks in order to accommodate the transaction volume that big blockers want to see, i.e. become viable for global-scale micropayments. Once we get 2MB blocks, it'll be patently clear within a matter of weeks that it's not enough, and then you will start shilling for 4,8,16 etc MB blocks, thereby jeopardizing the network further by pushing existing nodes off the network and making it possible only for high-bandwidth datacenters to host nodes. Seriously, what do you think 2MB blocks will do for growth? Precisely squat, that's what. We need smarter solutions like payment channels if we really want to serve the global economy.

I agree that it should be a much larger currency. All I'm saying is that we should be very careful and deliberate about how we try to achieve that. One slip up here could kill bitcoin, and there are so many dimensions and parameters (many of them not readily obvious) that need to be considered.
Look, I've been a software engineer all my life. I can't tell you how many times I've witnessed the "FFS JUST GIT IT DONE DUDE" cowboy coding attitude sink projects. When I'm hiring these days, that's the exact type of personality I try to quickly eliminate. At least with a centralized development model, you can fix it to a degree... but Bitcoin's network effect is so complex and the project has so many stakeholders (many of whom have invested their life savings in it), that fixing mistakes can be very costly, if not impossible.
My proposal is that we wait for LN or another layer2 solution to come out and asses what kind of block size it needs to function correctly, and then slowly and carefully increase it based on that assessment. Lifting it carelessly might make it possible for Roger Ver to cash out for fiat in the short term, but the long term damage could be irreversible.

No, you won't be able to use it because the world order will likely collapse. There will be no one to pay the people running the internet infrastructure. Fiber will go dark. Hell forget the internet, there will be no one to run basic services. If the dollar is gone and there is no nation-state actor to issue a replacement, it likely means we're living in a Mad Max scenario. I'm sorry to put it so bluntly, but all the fantasies about how we're going to be using the blockchain after a major societal collapse are kooky to say the least. Do you *really* think you'll be able to walk into an underground bunker and pay for a can of beans and ammo with your SPV mobile wallet?


You're forgetting that not everyone has a 100GBit fiber optic connection at home. Many of us are still on slow ADSL connections with asymmetric upload speeds. Disk space isn't much of an issue, it's the fact that we won't be able to run a full node due to bandwidth constraints. Remember that running a full node doesn't only entail relaying new blocks, we also have to serve the blockchain to new nodes on the network. Right now the blockchain is about 100GB in size. Many people have data caps. At 1TB or more, do you think we'll be able to serve the blockchain to the network? Or do you think only specialized data centers will, who are more than happy to shut you down if they get a court order to do so?
Bitcoin is not and can not be a replacement system for the dollar. It's delusional and stupid to think so. It's a complementary system that can exist as long as this technological civilization exists, which is contingent on the dollar (or some other major fiat currency) existing.


It's not logical.

Actually, an UTXO is a lot more than an address that hasn't been spent. It contains TX ids, which are not only longer than addresses, but they are also not useful without access to the transactions they're referencing. Furthermore, the "address" is not even a protocol level concept. It's just part of the most common type of script used nowadays, but there are lots of different script types that don't use addresses at all.

The quadratic problem is not disk space related, it's CPU related. Certain transactions can and will take much longer to verify, and if a block is full of them (it's a pretty convenient attack vector in fact), such a block will take much longer to propagate and will thereby increase orphan rates and end up partitioning the network. This is not a problem if nodes are geographically close, but the further they're spread out, the more the network will undergo schisms.
Please explain this to your buddy Roger Ver, who, for all his money, doesn't even seem to understand how Bitcoin works on the nuts and bolts level.
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:02:51
This won't help with sync speed very much, if at all. Headers first already takes cares of proper ordering.
 A larger blockchain takes longer to sync primarily because of these factors:
1. bandwidth needed - this is a linear parameter, so a 2MB block takes twice as long to download.
2. computational resources needed for verification - this one is quadratic, so a 2MB block takes 4 times longer to verify. A 8MB block takes 64 times as much.
But we should just "SCALE ASAP!!!11", turn the network into a Paypal 2.0, so that you greedy fucks, including the retard Ver, can dump your stashes for fiat - decentralization be damned, right? I have something to tell you: fuck you.

Sorry for screaming. I am just tired of arguing the exact same points over and over again.
Even if we agree that they act like an authority, no one forces anyone to use their client. Write your own client, maybe with different consensus rules, and once you add enough hashpower to it, there's the chain you want.
Unlike in the physical world, where political secession is impractical due to land being finite (and political authorities engaging in violence to enforce their claims), digital, blockchain-type systems are natural candidates for forks and secessions of all kinds (cyberspace is infinite). All you have to is convince enough people to join you. And as it currently stands, most people prefer being on the chain that follows the consensus rules enforced by the core client. So I think they *are* listening, contrary to your claim.
Don't like it? Tweak a few parameters and start your own chain. Many people [have done so already](

There is no one holding anything back. Anyone is free to create a fork and implement their own ideas however they wish. You don't get to impose your will on the users of this chain who consent to its consensus rules.

I don't know. I was just launching a new node a few days ago. Took days to sync. Just the past year worth of blocks was about 50% of the blockchain, and Bitcoin has been around for 7 years. And this is with 1MB blocks. I am not optimistic.
@_date: 2016-12-15 09:06:48
You really don't understand how this system works, do you? Again, CORE IS NOT SOME KIND OF AUTHORITY THAT CAN IMPOSE CHANGES OF ANY KIND. THEY JUST DEVELOP ONE PARTICULAR CLIENT. Consensus is created by the miners and full node operators who choose to run a certain network client and join a particular chain (i.e. conform to certain consensus rules). Whoever doesn't like it can FORK RIGHT NOW. 
You are free to start mining on a chain that implements whatever you want it to implement.
The fact that whatever you dolts are asking for hasn't been implemented is because there is NO CONSENSUS. Again, YOU DON'T HAVE THE CONSENSUS NECESSARY TO PUSH THESE CHANGES THROUGH. If the miners thought that a big block HF is the right thing to do, economically and technically, they would have already done it. There is NO MAGICAL ENTITY CALLED "CORE" THAT DOES WHATEVER YOU THINK IT DOES.
You should really learn how bitcoin works and what it is before you lose all your lunch money or something worse. Then come back and try to contribute in a constructive manner.
Stop trying to control this system politically. The world is already in a disastrous state as it is. We don't need more politics.

That only works because your magical SPV mobile wallet leeches off the full nodes, who have to send you your UTXO data. Without those full nodes (which cost money to run), there is no using bitcoin on your "basic hardware". When it becomes prohibitively costly to run a full node, bye bye mobile wallets.

Sure, not today. How about if the block size is 4MB and the blockchain grows half a gigabyte a day, or 210 GB/year? Many people have data caps much more restrictive than that. And a 4MB block size wouldn't even do much for the network, because the moment you increased it, malicious actors would start filling blocks again with spam transactions, just so that they can sow discord and attack the network via political means (and it's a *really* good attack vector, as we can see. I'm sure some big block proponents mean well, but you don't think there are some very powerful enemies of bitcoin very happy over what's going on right now?).

Substitution doesn't work here. Bitcoin and the bolivar are not qualitatively equivalent. One is a digital asset that can be used on a voluntary basis, the other is a state-issued fiat currency that people *have* to use if they want to participate in their local economy and sustain their life. If Bitcoin is too expensive for some, they can refrain from using it (or at least its layer 0). For many fiat currencies, that's not an option. There is **no fundamental human right** that entitles one to using Bitcoin. It's a **fee based system**, like most other things in this world.


Still true. I have just sent a traditional wire transfer overseas. I was informed it would take 2-3 days to clear. The other day I got paid for my services in Bitcoin. It cleared within 10 minutes.


Still true. The above mentioned wire transfer cost me $40. The above mentioned bitcoin transaction had a fee of 2 cents.
Look, the Haitian farmer is not affected by the ostensibly problematic 10 cent tx fee because he doesn't even have the means of receiving the payment. Ditto for education. What he would pay in electricity and internet/phone bills in order to be able to use Bitcoin far outweighs the "high" fee you keep talking about. Just like he wouldn't transact in CDOs and other exotic derivatives. He needs to transact in something that makes sense in his personal context.
One intellectually dishonest (or poorly thought out, I can't tell) argument that big-blockers keep using is that small blocks prevent the unbanked from using Bitcoin and that big blocks would solve that problem. Has it ever occurred to you that the farmer in question doesn't even have the necessary technological infrastructure to be able to process 8 or 16 mb blocks on their mobile device?
Many of those people don't even have proper access to food, water and sanitation, and yet they're constantly used in these pro big block arguments. I find that very disrespectful. If you really want to help them, go donate or move to their country and engage in humanitarian work. But what's more likely the case here is that you believe (erroneously) that increasing the block size will make your investment more profitable.

I think the key is to stop looking at the news for information because most of it is noise (and like you said, most news sources are agenda driven and hijacked), and focus more on reading books and self-educating by becoming a student of history, philosophy and other timeless disciplines.
By following the news you only know what's going in that precise moment; by studying history you become aware of larger patterns that shape human behavior (and often play out in cycles), and you become much more prepared to deal with anything the world may throw your way. Teach a man to fish and all that...

Your points are well articulated and I agree with some of them. The problem with raising the block limit "just this once" is that it communicates that toxic politicking, nagging and shilling on the part of a minority faction can be used in the future to change the rules of the protocol, and that said behavior can be used as an attack vector in the future. At some point a group of individuals will ask for the money supply to be expanded, again for "the greater good", this time probably to "help onboard late adopters and increase the adoption". You probably see what I'm getting at.
I actually don't think that 2MB would harm the network substantially (but larger increases would). But many of us can't give in simply because it would communicate to everyone that given enough time, money and effort, that the network participants can be coerced into working against their self interest.
When a certain individual stops paying people to attack the protocol in this manner, blocking segwit etc, many of us wouldn't see a problem with increasing the block size limit to 2MB. TLDR: stop attacking the network with politics and we can have a discussion. Many of us would rather see our investment go up in flames than stoop to what we consider "negotiating with terrorists".

Roger Ver has a lot of bitcoins and he thinks that entitles him to share of political control in the system. But what Roger doesn't understand is that Bitcoin is not a *proof-of-stake system*, so whatever monetary stake you might have doesn't affect the consensus aspect. It's a PoW system. If you want to effect change, you have to invest in mining hardware. This is on purpose, with the goal of making bitcoin resistant to political decisions and human capriciousness. Burning energy (creating entropy) is a much more expensive process than making changes with the flick of a pen. Without this aspect, bitcoin is worthless. If he got his way, Bitcoin would be as good as dead.


When did you *ever* offer to fund the development of the protocol itself - not one of your shitty companies built on top of bitcoin? When did you ever offer to fund the volunteers who invest their time, energy and labor into developing the protocol? That's right - never. Go away Roger Ver. Sell all your coins and leave.

You fail to understand a great many things, including how this world and universe work.
The correlation between "success" (an entirely subjective metric, btw) and "smarts" in fact pretty low. Luck accounts for a huge part of success in life, and there are plenty of smart people who ended up ruined and penniless, and plenty of rich, "successful" imbeciles who ended up being that way due to the nature of randomness and chance in life.
Your post indicates you seem to think that the correlation between "smarts" and "success" is ~100%, which is a massive fallacy in itself. You also seem to be a victim of the hindsight fallacy, where one fails to take poor decision making into account (e.g. engaging in risky and harmful practices) and judging a situation solely on its outcome - which more often than not, is a product of chance. An example of said fallacy would be playing Russian roulette, not dying and then saying "Nothing harmful happened so the decision to play was the right call". Many people succeed in spite of themselves, not because of themselves. Only a fool would retort to that with "Well, he must be doing **something** right". No, it's possible he's not doing anything right in fact. It's survivorship bias, plain and simple. For every hyper-aggressive, dumb, boorish individual like Trump and Ver, there are 10 Trumps and Vers that you don't know about because they are dead, in prison or a poorhouse.
I recommend reading "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman and "Fooled by Randomness" by Nassim Taleb; these books do a great job expounding on the topics I just mentioned.

I understand how Bitcoin works on the protocol level. I've done programming work for a number of Bitcoin companies and I was getting paid for my work in Bitcoin back when most people thought it was a joke or some kind of faux MMO game currency.
If anything, it seems *you* don't understand how it works, because you seem to think there is some central entity that can unilaterally raise this limit. If you want big blocks so bad, why don't you write your own client and offer it to the network? If it's wanted so badly, people should switch to it immediately no?

Yes. Every transaction has a number of inputs and outputs. The way they are spent works like this: when you are creating a transaction, you reference a previous transaction and at least one of its outputs. Those referenced outputs now become the inputs of your new transaction.
Check out this sample transaction where five outputs become the inputs to a transaction creating two new outputs:

The only thing that I know of that satisfies the criteria of internationally portable and devaluation-resistant is Bitcoin.

In a nutshell, a segment of the bitcoin community led by Roger Ver thinks that moneyed interests have bribed the core developers to keep the block size intentionally small in order to hurt bitcoin and to push out their own replacement solution. Decide for yourself whether there's any validity to that.

Let me ask you one thing: have you tried launching a new node recently and syncing the blockchain? Have you **ever** done it? It takes **days** to complete. Maybe with 2MB blocks it'll take a week, and with anything above that it'll take weeks if not months. Do you comprehend the damage this would do to decentralization? Without decentralization, Bitcoin's value proposition is utterly broken.

Like your interlocutor said, the average Joe is not not ready for Bitcoin and probably never will be, because the average Joe is just not smart enough to handle a system of this complexity. Just like the average Joe doesn't transact in exotic derivatives like CDOs in order to pay for a cup of coffee, the average Joe probably shouldn't transact in Bitcoin either.
When the average Joe stops being average, Bitcoin will still be here and waiting for him.
On a more serious note, a lot of evil and destruction has come to a lot of systems - political, economic, technological etc - from trying to pander to the lowest common denominator by dumbing the system down. I don't want to see Bitcoin become some shitty centralized Paypal 2.0 just so that Joe Blow can buy a can of beer with it.
TLDR: I don't give a fuck about the average Joe and his on-chain coffee. Bitcoin is a lot more important than that.

Indeed. Let's go a step further and reduce taxation to what it really is - extraction of labor/productivity. This statement be proven easily: if it was the money they wanted, they'd simply print more, which proves they want something else - the labor backing that money. They can't eat money, so they create it ex nihilo and want you to trade in your time and labor for it (they want the items you make), at a 40-50% discount (income tax).
I wonder what would happen if people started dropping out of the workforce en masse - what if everyone decided to work only enough to satisfy their basic needs and not more? Would the elites simply get rid of taxation (a proxy for productivity) and straight up enslave people and force them to work at gunpoint? Or would there be a reversion to a kind of medieval serfdom wherein one gets to keep his life and freedom as long as he manages to pay taxes on what he managed to grow and raise?
Before modernity, one could at least abandon his farm and try to homestead in an unclaimed location, or almost anywhere for that matter, because there was no technology available to the ruling class that would make it possible to track people on the same scale it's possible today. Today, with every square of land inch being monitored and accounted for, you can't build a shack in the middle of a forest anymore, lest you get harassed by a dozen government agencies. As modernity progresses, humans will have to get used to living with less and less freedom and more and more subjugation, constant scrutiny and full-spectrum dominance over their lives. The scariest thing is - most of them are so sedated that they don't seem to mind.

How do you enforce consensus other than with a threat of violence? Because a large portion of the network has decided they're not interested in larger blocks and they're not  going to change their opinion based on Reddit discussions.

On a more serious note, it's disconcerting to see how few people actually understand the underlying monetary and technical properties of Bitcoin. Even a lot of smart and heavily invested people fail to see what its true value proposition is and where it really shines. Censorship resistance, decentralization, antifragility - these are the qualities that differentiate it from everything else out there. If one fails to see that, they should take their coins, sell them and invest in Paypal, Circle or another centralized payment company.

Actually, it's *you* and *your* ilk trying to shove your political bullshit down everyone's throat. Most people **are not** interested in a block size increase at this point. The network has spoken but a certain vocal minority still won't shut up and realize it's not all about them. So if you don't like it, start your own fork and do whatever you want with it. Seriously, what's stopping you? You don't even have to start from scratch, you can build on top of the latest main chain block and fork from there. If your solution is so superior, it shouldn't be too hard to garner support, right? But every time you tried, your support topped out at around 10% of the network, and even then many of those nodes were fake and running on VPS instances. That would tell you something by now if you weren't so pig headed.


I actually do run a full node. And I have written services on top of bitcoin that people paid me a lot of money for. Unlike some uninformed hobbyists here, bitcoin has been my bread and butter for many years now.

I'd say the masses have always been dumb and incredibly easy to control. True progress and change were always effected by a small driven minority. The masses follow and consume. The creators lead and produce. The masses are a waste of air and contribute nothing to mankind (and destroy this planet to boot), and I sort of understand why the elites despite them, treat them like cattle and milk them for all they're worth.

You conveniently left out the fact that your transaction was referencing four (4) different transactions and that it was 797 bytes in size, as opposed to my transactions, which were 226 bytes each. The recommended fee all these days has been 80 satoshis per byte, and your transaction allocates only 50 satoshis per byte. In other words, your fee was too low for the size of your transaction. According to 21s website, the expected confirmation time for a 50 satoshi/byte transaction is 0-15 blocks, which sounds about right in your case.
So the source of your problems is linked to the fact that your fee was too low for the block space you were trying to buy. If you think that people shouldn't have to pay for block space, then you clearly don't believe in the concept of a fee market, in which case I don't know what to tell you since it's an ideological position.
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:49:43
The time needed to verify a block grows quadratically depending on how many transactions are in the block (block size). Example: a 2MB block takes 4x longer to verify than a 1MB block. A 8MB block takes 64x longer. Longer verification times would result in a larger orphan rate, network congestion and possibly network partitioning (also known as "forking").
Segwit solves this problem and makes block verification time linear. Therefore, if you want to increase the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE parameter, you first need segwit in order to linearize verification times.
By asking for a HF **before** segwit, the big block crowd continually demonstrates a lack of understanding of how bitcoin truly works on the nuts and bolts level. Either that, or they are trying to undermine bitcoin on purpose. I really can't tell sometimes.
I hope this explanation helps.

Since the majority of core developers work for Blockstream, Blocksteam and its investors effectively control the future of Bitcoin. I never expected to see a single VC-funded company hijack the project, but since we're already there, it is indeed their responsibility to fix what's wrong with it.

Nice, except when you're forcing people to custom made off-chain solutions because Bitcoin doesn't scale.
Maybe you should start doing your job for a change, and implement sensible tx relay policies, fee calculation algorithms and the ability to add custom made tx relay filters. You know, the things that will help Bitcoin scale, since your company has already taken upon itself to decide that block size doesn't need to be increased.

I've tried explaining this to people before but some of them just refuse to get it. The argument is "But the government protects you from the mafia!". Mafia also protects you from other mafia, as long as you pay your protection fee. Stupid people stay stupid.
Mafia is just a slightly more decentralized form of government. When a single mafia organization secures a monopoly on violence and providing protection, it can start changing the language and calling itself the government.

They still can't replace the certificate on your server. The fact that a CA can sign a faux certificate means nothing, because they would still have to hack into your server and replace it (they never get your private key during the signing process).
Furthermore, some modern cipher suites like ECDHE create a new ephemeral key-pair on every handshake, thus guaranteeing perfect forward secrecy (meaning that even if the government stole your certificate, they still wouldn't be able to decrypt previously transmitted traffic).

There's no reason to be afraid. Even if they create a "crypto" that's under their control and "full faith and credit", it'll be a crypto just in name. The reason why Bitcoin has value is precisely because no one is in control. If you're going to have a privately issued digital currency, then having a blockchain is a very expensive and inefficient way of doing it. The whole point of having a PoW blockchain is to generate consensus among distributed peers in a trustless manner. The fact that banks keep parroting the same nonsense about launching their own blockchain just shows that they don't get it.
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:52:49
Maybe something is going over my head here, but I really don't see why we are reinventing banks and all sorts of intermediaries to hold, regulate and inspect our money for us. This is the exact problem bitcoin was made to solve: to make money private once again, whereby our holdings are ours and ours alone, and not subject to 3rd parties' whims, "laws", "business models" et cetera.
At any rate, this guy is just parroting the same old line that's used so often to distance oneself from "Bitcoin the currency", presumably because they're ashamed to have their name associated with it, while still wanting in on any potential upside in the space. It's a form of reputational hedging: if it crashes and burns, then he can blame the currency and the crazy libertarians and anarchists, and if it goes up, he'll be a rockstar in his field because he "saw the potential when no one else did".

Property is already taxed in the majority of developed economies. It is de facto feudalism, because you never really own your property. Saying that you own something, while paying an annual rent for it, is paradoxical. The moment you stop paying your land rent, you are evicted from it and it is repossessed by its actual owner (the government). Therefore, you don't own it.

The problem with a lot of libertarians and anarchists is that their idea of having their own country starts out very noble, but will inevitably rapidly devolve into a Lord of the Flies scenario where the richest/most powerful person turns into an oppressive dictator and turns other people into his feudal subjects. Alternatively, it will become a regular nation-states that engages into heavy taxation, regulation and legislation.
I am convinced it is impossible to have the concept of a "libertarian country". These two things are at odds with each other, and the most powerful control mechanism will always overpower everything else (that control mechanism for humans is death, or in simpler terms, "I have guns and you don't, so OBEY OR ELSE"). Also, having a constitution doesn't limit government power at all, because its own courts interpret the constitution however they want.
Looks like some of these people will have to learn their lesson empirically.

It's funny, but he's a bit of a celebrity in the HN/startup circles (and also a buttcoin poster at some point). It's just amazing how many "smart" people will actively spend their time crusading against something they have zero stake in, if only to alleviate their bad feelings caused by the perception of missing the train. They did it at $5, $50, $250 and you can be sure they will be doing it at $5000, with their anger getting stronger as the price goes up.
Some really interesting psychology is behind it, and it's not completely fair to say they have "zero stake" in it as I mentioned before; in fact, his "payment" for trolling is resolving his cognitive dissonance and being able to convince himself he didn't in fact make a mistake by missing out. Hence why buttcoiners gloat when the price is going down.
Humans do this all the time. One of my coworkers was an early adopter/miner and quite an enthusiast at the $5-$20 range and he ended up selling his entire stash at a price much lower than now. You guessed it, now that the price is much higher, he's one of the more fervent haters/concern trolls I know. It just goes to show that humans will modify their viewpoints and behavior in order to resolve their cognitive dissonance. It's a well studied phenomenon.

Your appeal to emotion is nice but invalid.
Someone to whom 10 cents represents a great deal of money shouldn't get involved with something as volatile as Bitcoin because the negative utility delta they might incur from volatility is far bigger than the cost of one transaction which you are complaining about.
If what I said is too complicated for you, here's an ELI5: poor people stand to get destroyed holding volatile assets and the transaction cost should be the least of their concerns in that context. If that was also too complicated, here's an ELI2: if you get paid $20 a month and bitcoin goes down just 10% in that month (it often does), you lost 20x the amount of the ostensibly problematic tx fee.
ps. there is no contract, social or protocol-level, stating that the goal of Bitcoin is to bring banking to the unbanked. It's just digital cash, nothing more, nothing less. What you *want* it do be and do is another matter completely.

The issue with smart contracts is that they only work within their respective system, i.e. the Winklevii can't steal my coins within the bitcoin protocol because they don't know the private keys, but they could certainly do a side channel attack by hiring armed men to kidnap and torture me and give up my keys. Organized crime will always exist and power will always organize and collude in order to stay in power.
I think that until every part of our existence is machine-enforceable (e.g. some kind of technological singularity), there will always be some form of organized application of violence (government). These are intractable conundrums and that's why I said they're part of the human condition - you can't really remove these aspects of our existence as long as we are human.

It's funny to see how much faith people place in the system and the notion that "the law" should be able to "pierce through" anything if needed. Sounds good on paper, but the problem with human run systems is that they are prone to corruption, and it's not a question of if, but when, someone will use that same system and its rules to meet their own goals.
What bitcoin and encryption represent is a shift toward machine-run protocols where everything that happens is valid and permissible, and that which is invalid simply cannot happen due to the rules of the system. The more of our responsibility we defer to immutable math and set-in-stone algorithms, the less room we leave for corruption, loopholes and "just this one time, I swear" exceptions.
