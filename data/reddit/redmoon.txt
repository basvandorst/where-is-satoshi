I'm just glad at least one person at reddit got it.  Apparently just one.

Why is this in r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-24 01:31:58
thanks - sorry

How to scale?  Wasn't bitcoin designed to run out of steam?
@_date: 2016-03-08 20:45:43
I'm in favor of anonymity, but every time I read about some slime encrypting/locking someone's PC and taking bitcoins for the ransom, I think to myself "you better make sure you've really covered your tracks, but I kind of hope you didn't.  Most people that can afford a computer can afford a gun"

Except bitcoin.  Besides, just because everyone else is smoking crack doesn't make it a good idea.


I build and maintain enterprise networks for a fortune 15 company.  That statement was spot on as of last week.  The problem with anything using HTTP or HTTP-like communications as if they were TCP isn't the merit of the idea itself, it's the reason for doing it in the first place - firewalls only let 80/443 through.  Firewalls don't and won't understand using a port 80 channel as if it were a stream in any way shape or form reliably.  Things may seem okay in the lab or small scale simulation, but on scale in the wild they invariably break down.


Totally true.


I hope so.

Everything but UDP and ICMP.  As cool as HTTP is, it's a very centralized protocol living on a very decentralized Internet.  Now HTTP is the new TCP with every tom, dick, and harry running their app over http because it's all firewalls will let through.  HTTP is very bad at being TCP.

So I'd be curious how that gets turned into cash.  Based on my own limited travels in Africa, *everyone* has cell phones (unlockers are quite common), but wouldn't a bank have to ultimately to the currency conversion?

I'm curious as to the mechanics of this - does he have a wallet on his phone, or is there another entity in Uganda willing to hold a wallet on his behalf and let him withdraw cash from his bitcoin balance?

His Economic advisors are [his billionaire donors,]( many from wall street. So no he won't change anything about politics, except if he wins prove the "I know you are but what am I" defense actually works.

Hey when you've only got 6 days to get the job done, a ouija board is easier than a globe.

Judging by how they swallow anything at all coming out of his mouth with less than zero regard for what is true or not, I'd say the idiots who voted for him will never under any circumstances ever figure that out.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:35:00
What's the quickest way to buy?  Last time I did it took over a day.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:58:42
Umm . . . I don't see what that has to do with anything.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:55:06
I used .5 of my bitcoins to buy eth, and now the eth is worth more than the bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:15:58
Just wait until capt small hands tried to pull cash out of remittances to pay for his 'wall'.  Then I think bitcoin will skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:28:06
What about associating an IP address with a bitcoin address?
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:24:28


It's just a dns name, comprised of characters from the alphabet, seen in every browser everywhere.

It wouldn't be asking too much to publish that, would it?
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:22:11


If you are lucky.

Not sure if this is a good thing...

Work for a large health company.  My laptop has so much nannyware there's just barely enough left over to launch a couple of msoffice apps and draw windows on the screen.
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:50:30
No shit.  Just wait until trump tries to withhold remittances to pay for his wall.  I think bitcoin will go thermonuclear.

Long Live Bitcoin.

So if I have some bitcoin on my wallet on my PC, do I end up with XBitcoins and XBCC?  Of each?  Will I end up with two blockchains on my hard drive instead of one?
@_date: 2016-05-10 00:50:14
What's this got to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:49:36
It's still not worth voting for him.
