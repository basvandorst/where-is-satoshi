Novice here. I only know of Bitcoin from popular media and very little else. But the OP's words are meaningful and relevant for anyone involved in not just an evolution but a true revolution of any kind. I truly admire the vision and courage of those who are deep into the development of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and wish I had your guts and tenacity. Your way of thinking and achieving is what drives human progress.
Edit: Thank you, jonf3n, for my first Bitcoin. My apologies for any breach in Reddit etiquette as I am still learning this as well. I look forward to following the path that leaders like you will open for us.

Can we donate with Dogecoin?

Bitcoin is, when it all comes down to it, a combination of 1's and 0's so I'd say it does in a very broad sense since all computer software is based on 1's and 0's.

Thank you. Is there a way to search for "bitcointip" in just my Inbox?

Good point. Gold, being more scarce, would be used much less than copper and silver.

Thank you for great learning videos! Greatly appreciated!

Thank you. I'm new to this so fumbling my way around.

Gold has industrial and electronic uses. It is tangible, not just 1's and 0's. Bitcoin isn't something I can put in my pocket.

Thank you for sharing! I have very little knowledge about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Very generous of you to share this with us. I'd like to get at least a working knowledge of this.

Gold has industrial and electronic uses. It is tangible, not just 1's and 0's. I can pick up gold but not bitcoin. Bitcoin seems to be an abstract concept. I know I'm still missing something here, though. I appreciate the input.

Thanks! Generosity on the Internet can still be found.

Good points. Very eye-opening for me.

It sounds more like gambling and speculation than a solid currency. Thank you for the insights.

No, it didn't other than what people wanted it for. I see your point.
