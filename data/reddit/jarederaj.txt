In this case, I think it's clear that I am talking about a team and not talking about Bitcoin. If you install a full node you'll see that Core calls their project Bitcoin Core, too. Infact, Bitcoin ABC still hasn't been able to remove all the references to Bitcoin Core in the source code they copied.
Core is a good name for the team. I'd encourage you to embrace the name that they gave themselves. Also, when communicating about multiple implementations "Bitcoin Core" removes an otherwise ambiguous reference. Still, and I think this is your primary point, a reasonable person would agree that capital B Bitcoin is observed to be Bitcoin Core. The confusion other projects are trying to inject is absurd on the surface.

It updates every day at 00:30 GMT.
There will be a new column for 2018 in a couple months.
The time travel feature will change the data folder structure so it's more like an API. There will be a standard naming format so you'll know when and where to grab the current table. I'll probably use a unix timestamp for each folder name. Just calculate the timestamp from the date you want and you'll be able to grab the right data.
The git repo will fill up with a lot of garbage commits if I leave it in the current structure... so, it will work until one day it stops, and then you'll have to figure out how to grab "todays" data from the right folder.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:59:01
Are you looking at all the other columns and the graphs? This stuff is calculated every day. There's nothing fake, unreliable, or deceptive about it. The first two columns are only calculating data from the last 30 days or less... so it's not even painting an ugly picture. You can use this data to argue that now is a great time to buy. Arguing against that perspective is FUD.
Edit: it appears there was a ninja edit. was calling this FUD.

Specifically, I said "any time soon, if ever."
THere's no guarantee that segwit needs to hit even 50% adoption for it to resolve the Mempool buildup and support lightning. Maybe that will happen eventually, but we're talking about a huge upgrade in the total number of possible transactions. It could take a long time for user adoption to get to the point that it needs to become that large of a percentage of transactions.

 Math Update
Three donations came in last night! Thank you! I didn't think that would ever happen.
It's enough for a three months of server time. If that wallet gets up to a year worth of server time I'll be able to implement the time travel feature and a few other upgrades that should make Moon Math more fun for everyone (SSL and better mobile support is needed asap). 
Thanks again!
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:11:21
Great Question. Is it okay if I copy you word for word in a FAQ?
I'm still working up the FAQ, and I think your question should be the first question.
The Rainbow Charts are generated using the Compound Daily Periodic Rate (CDPR).  The CDPR is similar the a Daily Periodic Rate (DPR), except it considers compounding when it's derived. CDPR looks at the price change over time and creates an interest calculation that predicts today's price from the starting price for the given period. The two Rainbow Charts I've been leaving posted by default are calculated based on the 2012 CDP and the 2017 CDPR. The table below the rainb chart shows more CDPRs based on different time periods. It also shows doubling rates and projects when the price might reach a given price based on the CDPR for the period that's set in the given column.
Please ask clarifying questions. I want to give you a good answer that's clear and easy to understand.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:18:05
I've been thinking about doing a focused post on this for a couple weeks. You can check my comment history for some content on my position. I have a developing narrative that needs a full explanation. Generally, tether is not well understood and there is a ton of misinformation from people who claim to be authoritative. I find the FUD around it to be mildly infuriating.
When I get some better sources for information I'll do a hit piece on the FUD and fake news.
Generally, I think you can ignore anyone who is commenting on it any-which-way. I don't care which side someone is on; they're all uninformed.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:23:07
Despite the downvotes, this is good criticism. The related sections need a couple focused Moon Math articles and references. Thanks for reading and commenting.

7-day and 30-day are totally unreliable and swing way too often to make any sense. If bitcoin were less volatile I'd look at them more. These numbers are as or more volatile than the price.

"Time travel" is a feature I've planned for. I'm still working out a few details of how I want that to work. I'd like the have good multi-chart comparison features too. Ideally, I think you should be able to go back and see how these charts/graphs render on any day in history, and be able to compare tables from different dates.
You can review my submission history. Here's the oldest version of the chart that I can link to easily:
Obviously, the 2017 column was making insane predictions based on the date that it was published. I took a lot of flak when I posted these early last year.
I'm not a true believer, though. It's bizarre to me that this has had any predictive power. It has been accurate, but it has not been correct, if that makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:00:34
You might consider doing some research into opposing narratives so you can consider more than one argument in your discussion of the facts we have to interpret USDT with. You haven't shown in this thread that you have done that.
I do understand the arguments against and for USDT, and i will discuss them at length when I have to time fully elucidate them. I suspect that I will do the same for both positions and that I will discover that positions for and against USDT are both red herrings.

Yeah, I was happy to see that we didn't have an explosive bubble like the one in 2013. I think we'll continue to see slower and slower growth as the price swings become a smaller and smaller percentages. A CDPR of .2% daily with extremely low volatility will be a dream investment for everyone. Much rather have my money in that then a bank.

LocalBitcoin is a huge market and grows for more than one reason. Generally, though, it should show the number of people who are willing to buy bitcoin on the street for who knows what reason. 
People use it because it's the first best workable solution. Seeing it grow is insanely bullish. 
IMO, it's as close to a pure market as you can get. LocalBitcoin is real world demand in developing markets. Those are the places where you eventually see exchanges build up and take over LocalBitcoins demand.

At the moment, it's both. The block size has increased and more transactions are being processed in every block. We'll see how this plays out. I think we'll see a lot more transactions being processed next time the MemPool fills up. Seeing the total throughput increase under load while segwit is &gt; 20% implemented will be the real test.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:55:43
Segwit is also bulk transactions and optimization on some transactions.

This is an interesting observation. I don't expect an s-curve of adoption. I doubt that segwit will approach 50% adoption any time soon, if ever. I do think that it's interesting that we can have 2+ MB blocks with 20% adoption, though. The problem Segwit is designed to resolve is clearing out the Mempool... not so much moving every transaction to Segwit. That's not necessarily required for Segwit to resolve the issues in Mempool, as we see. We'll see how this plays out, but Segwit puts economic pressure on people who use Bitcoin to use it more efficiently. I think we'll see that instead of full segwit adoption.

I don't think I understand what you're implying. Are you saying that they bought when it was at the moon and that we're on the way back to earth?

It expreapolates from different dates, other than that, yeah, you got it. The FAQ can clue you into a little more. ATM, it's that simple of a model. I've been playing with variations on this concept that use Metcalfe's Law that show more s-cruve like adoption, but I haven't published them yet because they'd be convincing enough to be dangerous... at least this way when people ask for efficacy I can just give them a flat "no" and remind them that it's a rorschach test and a tool for reflection, like a horoscope.

This is a good question.
was doing his rainbow charts through that period. He calculates the growth rate a little differently, but he has always held about .3% daily.
To your core question, yes. The rates change daily. It's been a while since the 30 - 90 day rates have been below zero, but it happens and it has happened this year. The tables would have been negative almost all the time in 2014.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:44:32

Moon Math has been bizarrely accurate for far too long. Just ignore any column that's less than 100 days old. For some reason it keeps acting as a lower bound instead of an upper bound. Any other investment would be bouncing down from these numbers. Bitcoin bounces off of them as if they describe support levels.

That's a well reasoned argument, so there's no reason to downvote. 
Sure, you can achieve looping with block chain [with bitcoin] if you're willing to wait long enough and spend enough. I'll concede that. A mechanical loom is also Turing complete in this sense. To me it seems like a debate over semantics. It passes the basic test, but it's not practical and it doesn't scale.
Bitcoin is less of a compute engine than Ethereum by design. It's a feature. You use the distinct tools for the distinct jobs that they are best suited. I feel like I'm being forced to be mildly autistic stating it that way, though. For example, I can use and electric drill to pound a nail, but why would I do that if I have a hammer?
In short. Szabo and Maxwell are reacting to the absurdity of any attempt to implement such a thing and Wright is being oblivious by conflating the definition of turing completeness with the greater ecosystem his proposal would have to exist in.
Edit: This argument actually exposes Wright's ignorance about bitcoin, though he may be technically correct about what is and is not turing complete. It becomes more interesting when you consider the he's supposed to be researching how well bitcoin scales. I think he might be missing some details in his modeling, and that's what has lead him to state such a thing so adamantly.
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:43:44

I didn't hear a question in what you wrote, but I'll try to make my point a little more clearly in regard to Wright's claims about looping and turing completeness within Bitcoin. The bottom line is that it's unclear how anybody would achieve what Wright is suggesting. It's not that it's impossible, it's that it completely contradicts everything that we currently know and practice. We're all happy to re-evaluate that if he or anybody publishes something that shows what he's saying to be true, but we're not going to make an argument up for him that's only based on blind speculation and half truths.

USDT can go down for several reason. The biggest reason is that there isn't demand for it. Less demand for liquidity is not caused by people getting into the market. That's USD leaving the market that probably isn't going to come back in. If that's happening when the price is dropping... well, there you go.

It's unlikely that Craig Wright is SN. Craig Wright wrote [The IT Regulatory and Standards Compliance Handbook: How to Survive Information Systems Audit and Assessments]( which is both sophomoric and riddled with grammatical errors. It's generally known that Satoshi did not make these sort of errors.
While Craig might have had something to do with Bitcoin around the time it was getting off the ground he almost certainly did not posses the cognitive capacity to develop bitcoin in 2008/2009, or currently. I believe it's more likely that he became involved between 2011 and 2013. Around that time he also started trying to leave a trail of digital bread crumbs that lead to him.
In the video of him at the panel he seems to be mistaking what bitcoin might eventually do—with changes to the protocol—and what bitcoin currently does. I'm referencing the argument between Craig Wright and Nick Szabo about turing completeness. In that conversation he also doesn't seem to understand the problem set that Ethereum is trying to solve; mistaking looping in ~~fourth~~ FORTH with Bitcoin's scripting language which is **purposefully not Turing-complete** as a feature—omitting a discussion about that is damning evidence. Not allowing loops makes Bitcoin scripts fully deterministic; and that allows you to know exactly when the code starts and stops and prevents the system from looping back on itself and crashing.
Even if Wright is correct, Ethereum is a global computer and executing loops by making calls to a separate stack brings in complexities that require the attention of a new focused and open project. It's precisely because of the **many** complexities that Ethereum makes sense. Also, framing the discussion as one where bitcoin and Ethereum are somehow in competition is absurd.
I have no doubt that Craig has a large vocabulary, but I'm calling bullshit. He should have been able to have a more intelligent conversation with Nick if he was Satoshi.
Finally, how? How can Satoshi be a reclusive genius and a self aggrandizing blow-hard. It makes no sense.

I'm focusing on the properties that tether has on the market more than I'm focusing on Tether, specifically. The illustration I'm using points at the reduction of tether by 300 million over the last 3 weeks. That illustrates a reduction in available capital flow more than anything. One tether can be used for any number of transactions. When you remove that tether your removing a large number of potential transactions. You're also removing something that the market is backed by. It's a real measure of available resources.

The exchanges represent an existential threat to Bitcoin. If you check out my history (you can see that I've been saying this for a while. In light of the chaos on all the exchanges, domestic and otherwise, I believe what we're seeing is the first wave of evidence showing existing exchange concepts to be fundamentally flawed. There is a better way, though, and people are already working on it.
Bitcoin isolates one problem and it solves that one problem really well. This follows the Unix tradition of software development. The question Satoshi asked him/her/it self was "how can I prevent double spending on a global network in a with a Turing complete methodology?" Finding a functional answer required the collaboration of many preexisting technologies and one new one; we call that new technology a "block chain." The newness of the block chain overshadows those older technologies, but they're all required for the Bitcoin protocol to exist.
Calling Bitcoin a "protocol" doesn't do it justice. Bitcoin sets up a series of rules that must be followed for functional participation. Bitcoin is a series of contracts that are recorded and enforced by the new distributed database we're calling the block chain. How you participate with Bitcoin positions you within the Bitcoin protocol. And when you look at the Bitcoin protocol as a large number of cooperative roles, you can see that it begins to become more of an ecosystem. Categorizing it as a "protocol" might suggest that it is less sophisticated than it really is.
Let's step back and look more at those technologies that produce the Bitcoin ecosystem (protocol?). These are the technologies that go into making Bitcoin functional that aren't a part of the block chain. They run the servers, handle communication, compile the software, hash records, connect ports, open sockets, and on and on. The technologies that produce the Bitcoin ecosystem are themselves only a part of a greater whole. Obviously, Bitcoin only uses a part of the cryptographic/networking/programming/database world. Satoshi originally asked one question and was educated enough to find the distinct technologies he needed to produce a working model, Bitcoin. But it turns out that there are not only many other questions that can be asked but also entire categories of problems that might be answered. It's not necessarily the block chain itself that's going to solve these problems, but one of the hundreds if not thousands of similar technologies and techniques.
Forming a more complete programming language to describe these technologies and techniques is the job of a new (in alpha) open source project called Etherium. To understand the need for a programming language like Etherium you have to understand that there is a rich world of cryptography that is ripe for use, but largely inaccessible due to the complexity. The breakthrough this article suggests is that the programming language Etherium opens up the cryptographic ecosystem to more people. This is the announcement of a cryptographic reformation.
The long and the short of it is that the next generation of distributed computing solutions is on the way. My recommendation to you is to hold on to your money or invest it in Etherium servers. 50k wouldn't go very far toward making an exchange, anyway.

Sure, that's how a distributed exchange could work too.  Just like that.
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:11:54
Watch the video. It's a turing complete implementation of the block chain and such a radical concept that not many people are going to understand it until things have been built with it.
You wouldn't build one exchange with it, though you could. A better implementation would be to build millions of exchange like entities that are operated by and between each other. Entities could be human or some sort of a decentralized autonomous organization.

You could handle that any number of ways, but let's use the Socratic method for a simple example of how that *might* work for one type of solution.
A: I send you you $10 and you send me 1btc.  That is how it would work.
Q: But what if I don't send you 1 btc
A: Then you would lose something that's more valuable.
Q: But what if I didn't give up anything?
A: then I wouldn't send you $10
Q: Who would hold the BTC I put in escrow
A: Everyone
Q: why would they give it up?
A: because if they didn't they would have to give up something more valuable.
Q: Who is holding their BTC in escrow.
A: Everyone.

That would be a matter of working out the specific protocol, but the details of the question you're asking have already been worked out and can be implemented when Ethereum gets out of beta.
There's not really steps. That's the wrong approach. Similarly, when you torrent a file there's not a step by step process that gives you a complete file.  It happens as the result of a complex protocol.  Ethereum is a protocol that comes  with Turing completeness. This isn't to say that "it just happens."  The details of how it happen just don't follow a step by step fashion when you're thinking about this in traditional terms.
I'll digress further. Imagine creating a network of machines that can compute things without knowing what they're computing. This remains true to some degree of O^*n* terms of complexity, no matter the sophistication of the entity doing the interrogation. This allows you to create applications that process everywhere and nowhere.  Because your application is everywhere but cryptographically secure portions of private details can be independently processed.  Hierarchies of trusted networks can also be generated and "punished" based on the terms of the "contract" that they're working under.
The solution isn't in the steps, it's in the ecosystem that the protocol creates. Ethereum lets you define the rules of those ecosystems. To create something that's exchange like you would write protocols that amount to digital contracts.  These "contracts" enforce an environment that's favorable to the purpose you've set out to construct.  So, how would you create an exchange?  You'd write a contract that punishes participants for not behaving like an exchange and rewards them for doing a really good job as an exchange. It's no different than it is now, except that it lowers the bar to entry significantly and removes all the human labor.  It also makes everything distributed, transparent, and objectively fair.

This is demonstrably false. You can transfer money to another account without a centralized service. There are credit cards.  Look at the internal bank transfer mobile apps that are coming out too. Also, we're talking about a protocol and not an instantaneous transfer.  In some cases things can take a lot of time. It needs to be able to work in rural Africa as well the united states too. so I don't really understand the obsession with bank transfers, anyway. This is also for people that don't have access to banking.  Also, I don't have to remove all centralization for my argument to be true.  I only have to remove the exchanges. 


There's no question here, you're just stating that you're right without evidence or making a reasonable argument. Even worse, you're making a straw man argument by insisting that my argument depends on statements that I've never made or implied.

That would be up to the individual accepting fiat. They could accept cash, check, credit card, bank transfer, photos of kittens, plastic dinosaurs.  Whatever that person publishes could be made available.  I think for your specific use case people would be searching for cost effective means of purchasing bitcoin with bank transfers or credit card payments.  


Yes, this can be done without everybody on the exchange sending everyone else a penny at the cost of a $40 bank transfer.  Ethereum is Turing complete and these things are simple to calculate on something that is at it's core a ledger. It's silly to assume that I was expressing an interest in creating billions of micro transfers.
These orders can be done offline the same way you can store BTC on a paper wallet.  It wouldn't necessarily be fiat that you're working with either.  You could build something like ebay with almost an identical concept. How you exchange for things like BTC can be determined by the protocol that you're using.  It's a detail with thousands of possible solutions.


I brought up torrents to explain a little about how distributed software works.  This comment makes absolutely no sense. Do you really think I'm suggesting that they're the exact same thing?

This was the obvious best answer to this problem but the underlying technology is not well enough understood, and that's probably why it wasn't selected. It's a shame, because this was an opportunity to fund an important project that could have brought about real change in the sphere and provided a code base to serve as a point of reference for what is possible. I hope you're still working on this.

It might be a mistake to state that these technologies are analogous to each other at all. Instead, we should be talking about a cryptographic revolution; a world that extends out from early features of the web more advanced and modern technologies that make the web a truly free place. The block chain is a big deal because it has implications everywhere that include implications for BitTorrent, that community of users, and relevant features/functionality.

Stock to flow ratio makes new bitcoin more rare than new gold after halving next year. The halving after that and new BTC is over 2x more rare than new gold.
The market doesn't know how to price an asset that becomes more rare over time.
Bitcoin will go over 1 million in less than a decade.
Market cap is not an absolute measure of value and market cap vs gdp or money supply is nonsensical. Those numbers all mean something very different.

We only see that happening in bear markets. These data suggest logarithmic growth that's speeding up as the price goes up. I don't see how it's possible to infer the opposite. Look at the charts using a log scale.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:49:44
I'm thinking about implementing a version of this idea on the site when I get around to it. Give people the ability to project from different days and see how rates have changed over time. Will be a fun playground.
Historically, moon math has always been very wrong on specific dates. On the aggregate it has been shockingly accurate. Not a lot of people or systems were calling for 10k by the end of the year, but I've been getting shit for that since May. That's one of the reasons I give a lot of credit to His charts had it right from the beginning and through much harder times.

They're all in my post history. Just click on my username and full text search for 
"Compounding Daily Periodic Rate"
After that stops showing up it's using a different basis for the calculations that's more optimistic. Use 
"Daily Periodic Rate"
after that.

lots of places. search google. I use coindesk's data sometimes. Can't recall what I used for this.
I calculate the interest. I think there are a couple valid ways to do this. You can use the Daily Periodic Rate, which is bullish, or you can figure out the actual compounding daily periodic rate, which is more correct. I wouldn't call either accurate. It seems like the simple Daily Periodic Rate is more accurate and less correct to me, if that makes sense. I use the more correct and less accurate Compounding Daily Periodic Rate.
    Compounding Daily Periodic Rate = ((CurrentPrice/StartingPrice)^[(1/DaysInPeriod))-1]
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:47:04
That's a way you can think of it, yes. Here, it's probably just days, but you could calculate the compound interest down to the second.

You'd need 80 trillion in liquid market value to maintain free flowing markets that actually represent today's entire economic transaction volume. The actual ceiling would be astronomically higher than the reserve sum of all free flowing global currency because only a small portion of total BTC will be used to transact. Think about this in terms of real estate: the total value of all real estate is much higher than the fiat value of all real estate transactions in a day/month/year.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:08:27
0.35% has been on the conservative side going back to July of 2010. 2017 has been pretty nuts, but institutions are coming onboard now, at least as far as having access. As more institutions put their money into Bitcoin we should see these rates increase substantially. At that point we're really seeing Satoshi's "[Self fulfilling prophecy]( taken a couple orders of magnitude past where he thought it would be in 10 years. It's not just a couple hundred thousand software guys playing around with their extra dollars every month. I think the real show is starting next year. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:45:27
Yeah, I think we're talking about the same thing. Moon Math doesn't get it right very often... and the historical data in my post history isn't reliable. Working on a solution. Please keep on top of me about this. It's one of the core questions that I haven't fully answered for myself.

Everyone who was going to sell under 10k sold to large investment firms. Those firms are competing to consolidate vast reserves of BTC. Consumer adoption is how it's being advertised so that LTH strategies capitulate. The protocol will be fat with cash. There's no money for businesses or banks, because they're not needed. All the money will be in holding BTC, not providing services around it.

I mean, we don't know what's going to happen. The chart just shows what's implied if the logarithmic growth we've seen continues. It could stop for no reason. It could also speed up. I, personally, see more reasons for it to speed up. Maybe what we've seen in 2017 is a little too fast, though. Hard to say.

I mean, I wouldn't take that approach. If it's enough to be worth selling, then you might consider using some kind of DCA strategy. We've looked like we were in the sell range for over a year. It just keeps going up.

We're basically at 200 billion. There's no need for a purchase like what you describe. That's not how market cap works. you don't send a dollar to everyone when the price goes up a dollar. You are confusing market cap and liquidity. 1 million USD per btc is 21 trillion when all btc are mined.

It has been the most accurate predictor of long-term price performance this year. I'm putting the current channel at about 0.75%, but it could tilt all the way up to 0.9%. That 2017 column has been sticking around that for a long time.

In order to short you have to buy. My understanding is that it should actually make the price more stable. What am I not understanding about these futures markets?

Sasha and I talked about private keys, quadrigacx, and a variety of topics relevant to bitcoin today. Sasha used some of my commentary to coin the phrase "Cathedral Coins," which is a term meant to be critical of the approach taken by some blockchain developers to provide top top-down solutions that needs to be built from the bottom up. We spend a fair amount of time discussing that concept together in the podcast.
Moon Math is a *speculative curiosity* and **not** a theory of the market or a tool for trading. You cannot use it to evaluate risk or project possible ROI. Never the less, some people do that.
To me, it’s more interesting to speculate about what might cause the projected scenarios to be a reality or what will prevent them from coming to fruition. What an observer might see or take from Moon Math says more about the observer than it does about whatever investments they might or might not have.

 Math Update
Go to  for the full moon math table and rainbow charts 
Applying the moon math table to Local Bitcoin (LBC) volume projects 20 million
USD per day by the end of April. That substantially surpasses all mining demand.
LBC volume is considered an important indicator because it's an exchange of
last resort. Most people using it would use anything else if they could. IMO,
it predicts growth of new markets.

It's for comic relief. The negative CDPR is the thing that I find depressing. On the upside, when numbers look like this for a while they tend to reverse. IMO, the rational response is to look at those numbers and think "this is a good time to start buying again." It can't get much more desperate looking from here. The 90 day is at the peak of the last bubble. In 30 - 60 days this chart is going to look pretty amazing again.

You might consider focusing the presentation more. 5 minutes isn't enough time to make a compelling argument. Maybe "three ways lightning will change bitcoin." Just making the argument that Bitcoin is hard money could take 15 minutes.
What are the objectives of the assignment?
Here's a go at what you asked for.
1. Hard money vs Fiat (see The Bitcoin Standard): The price of Bitcoin has grown logarithmically against a fixed supply of 21 million Https://
2. The value of networks increase logarithmically in proportion with users. See metcalfe's law
3. New systems like lightning are being added on to Bitcoin, competing for space on the blockchain as a settlement layer instead of individual transactions.

It has only taken 2 - 3 years to recover once. That was after Mt.Gox Imploded. That was about 80% of our established infrastructure at the time, by trade volume. 
2013 - 2014 is not similar to where we are today. Bitcoin is not a four-year fractal on repeat. The market forces that caused the boom and bust cycle then are orders of magnitude greater than what we're seeing today.
If you're going to make comparisons you need to go into a deep analysis that compares the state of Mt. Gox to the state of Alts.
"Everyone" is not aware of Bitcoin's existence. "They're" certainly not aware of how it works and "they" don't own any of it. "They" don't have a practical use for it in their lives and "they" don't know how to get it. "They" don't care to find out.
"Everyone" is aware of gold, and even then, most people don't care to go out of their way to acquire it. If they had the means, then maybe. If everyone were aware of Bitcoin then it would be speculated on similarly to gold because global rates of adoption would be amazingly high. It's not, and it won't be for a while. We can only bust at the seams for so long until we must cool off.
We, Bitcoin, are licking our wounds and getting a plan together so the next round of this is handled better. Infrastructure is improving, and will continue to improve. The hash rate will continue to go up, and more people will find a practical use for bitcoin.
A sudden drop in speculative fervor is not the same thing as having a clear majority of your infrastructure curl up and die overnight; which was caused by one of the largest international thefts in history (and gross incompetence) ... and then the government of 1/3 of the world’s population, where most of the trading and mining is happening, fucks with you endlessly. 
I haven't even mention "Willy Bot" yet.
"Slow" and steady. We're doing fine.

Everything looks great! Confirming the bottom of the channel sets up extremely bullish long-term projections. Only short-term projections show bearish performance. The vast majority of Bitcoin's history indicates dramatic returns if you buy using a DCA strategy in periods like this.

# The Last Great Bubble
Go to  for the full update and rainbow charts 
Taking a different approach today. I Published the Moon Math rant on tradingview
with the analysis you see below. Today's wild speculation needs visual assistance to make much
sense, and Trading View seemed the most practical way to communicate these ideas
in a way that allows you all to call bullshit on me in a month or two.
Trading View: 
 Currently:
Bitcoin is in a period of consolidation at the bottom of the long-term channel.
Movement will seem sideways and down until indicators signal the next wave of
adoption. Sentiment will remain low.
 A : Medium-term consolidation
Resistance to growth remains through February and part of March while bearish
and moderate performance causes increased price stability. Two descending wedges
are broken before bullish sentiment can return.
 B : New ATH sometime between May and July 2018
Two descending wedges are broken--drawn from the 2017 ATH and the January 2018
breakdown—and moderate to bullish sentiment pushes bitcoin to a new ATH. ATH is
established somewhere between 20K and 28K USD. A new wave of adoption from new
markets is identified. Full capitulation from alt market speculation exposes
frivolous Crypto Assets.
The ascending wedge between the 2017 and 2013 ATH is difficult to break. It’s
EXTREMELY LIKELY that following scenarios take an additional 10 months. Price
targets for an extended scenario are substantially higher.
 C : Price is pushed over 50k sometime between June and August or as late as November 2018
Bitcoin's user base rapidly grows. It’s fueled by new growth and a new wave of
users. Segwit and Lightning adoption demonstrate 100x increase in possible
transaction support while significantly decreasing transaction fees.
LocalBitcoin processes 20 to 40 million USD in transactions daily. Press praises
Bitcoin as a tool ready or nearly ready for “Main Street.” A use case for
Lightning in retail businesses is implemented in some markets.
 D : Bounce off the top of the channel between July and October, or as late as March 2019 
The speculative fever lasts and Bitcoin hits the top of the long-term channel
for the first time since November 2015. The new ATH is somewhere between 90k and
200kUSD. The extended scenario sets a price target of 500k USD.
Hitting the top of the channel signals a long-term bear market and moves the
price into a comparatively moderate range, well under 100K USD. Bouncing off the
top of the channel completes before speculation about the halving takes hold of
sentiment in early 2020. 
By the end of 2020, 1 million USD price targets are commonly issued from
established financial institutions in the United States.
Good hunting

I agree with people who see the long-term volatility of Bitcoin will drop as the price goes up. It seems reasonable that concentrations of BTC will diffuse over time. I can think of a few ways to map that over time. Of course, it could also be that the number of addresses increases because the same people keep creating more addresses. I don't think that's the story, though.
I'm speculating that the the price of Bitcoin stays extremely volatile for as long as it has a sub 1 Million USD price tag, or thereabout. Price stability probably doesn't have a specific price so much as it has required conditions, though.
* Market Capitalization is too high for any co-ordinated group to attack
* Number of nodes/wallets continues to expand
* The network of users continues to grow
* Ability to transact is not overly burdened by fees
There are probably a bunch more. That's just off the top of my head.
1m USD/BTC is just a guess. Probably not a great one, but probably not terribly wrong, either.

 Moon Math Update
 Going long 
I'm 10x long. 8x stake  
We're in a position where the scenario bears have been trading off of is in jeopardy of being invalidated and we're near the bottom of the range where a move like that would trigger. Not planning on being able to sleep, but I'm probably going to have to leave this open longer than I want. This is a high risk high reward trade.
If bear TA is invalidated we're going to see a lot of traders, as a whole, exit the market. That almost certainly changes market composition. A large bulk of traders are probably net bearish on BTC and will stay out of the market until there is a framework they can use to trade against. That should take a long time to work up to.
Fundamentals are signalling that BTC is oversold.
Moon Math is indicating that the time is right for the market to reverse back up.
 Chart Modifications
There's been some drift from Azop's original rainbow charts that I corrected today. This happens from time to time. We should be much closer and the charts should be easier to read. I also tightened the 2017 trend chart.
We're solidly in the green quadrant of Moon Math charts. It's a struggle to hold back the noob DCA recommendation. Still too volatile, though.
the rainbow needed to be moved up to keep it consistent with vision. Azop ran his rainbows from a fixed date using a fixed CDPR of around 0.333%. Sometimes he would change the CDPR. Moon Math introduced a dynamic rate based on observed price performance that pretty much always stays in that range. However, the rainbow will drift up and down from Azop's charts because it's not fixed. I'll correct the rainbow so it more accurately represents his latest chart when major drift becomes obvious or on request.
* 
* 
 Moderate "Buy" Recommendation
Measures for volatility have not improved. I've considered downgrading the moderate buy recommendation to a hold recommendation, but you should be looking at these recommendations when you're considering your own DCA strategy. Volatility hasn't increased that much and we're still holding in a pattern that has a 65% chance of breaking down. If you're goal is to DCA through a potential dip, and your comfortable with taking initial losses, then this remains a good place to **slowly** add to a position **without leverage**. 
 Unpublished Noob DCA strategy
The noob DCA strategy has not been issued because volatility is still too high. If your grandmother has been asking about when it's time to buy bitcoin, this is not the time. There's too much risk that the floor will drop out from under us while weekly BBands are this wide in a bear market. The goal is to make noobs feel good about their investments for months, not scare them away with dwindling fiat value, or the constant looming threat of dwindling fiat value.

Local Bitcoin global weekly volume is continuing to keep pace with long-term trends. 1 billion USD a week by the end of 2019 is an unbelievable projection, but that's moderate to conservative based on these data.
We'll probably see these rates of adoption drop as more established and regulated platforms for exchange establish themselves internationally.

Time to implement a consensus based whitelist in the forum using ethereum.

We have a broader understanding of how these things might play out now. As the technology and applications change you need to change the metric too.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:53:04
That headline, though.

The Economist never struck me as a click bait publicaction that uses titles that contradict the content.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:41:48
I just lost all the respect I had for The Economist.

There's a good chance that today it will double it's previous daily high (set yesterday in volume.
I started setting up my account last Tuesday when it was in Beta. I might have fiat in there tomorrow.
Gemini is late to the party. It's interesting because it's growing organically and slowly and not because of the hype.

Yeah, we'll see. If Bitcoin goes over 10k this year I'll have to make some adjustments.

In what way? Data updates itself once a day. Are you looking for some other adjustments?

Acquisition of a title is usually done through payment to an organization that's offering that title as a service. In some cases people claim to be an expert and nobody questions that. In other cases businesses provide titles to employees who appear to have skills that their managers are unable to evaluate. The press sometimes acquire the status of expert by the way of writing an article or two... or writing or editing a book, or co-authoring a book. In the best-case, someone transitions from an existing industry that is at least somewhat relevant. They're able to apply a perspective that's consistent with the group of people who want to hear what they have to say.

I think they're talking about an explosion of AI that need humans to make changes in the real world that support their own subsistence, let, and expansion.
At some point you just need the hu.ans to get things in the right place at the right time. If the demand be for that is paired up with an infinite expansion of AI then humans become the scarce resource.

Thanks.  I'm honestly looking for an education on this.  I want to know what a variety of people think.

100,000 in 10 years. That means he's predicting that the growth of bitcoin will dramatically slow down. If you bought at a reasonable time, or cost averaged in, you're making 0.6% percent DAILY. his prediction is under .1% daily. The last 30 days have been 2.18% daily.

Someday I'll spend some time on it. As of now, I've made 0.01 BTC from this site this year... and that was a donation. All of that will go to basic operations (domain name and server costs -- [EFF pays for the ssl service]( Yay EFF! Donate to EFF!).
If I ever stop choking on the stress of normal life I'll get that fixed for you and the nearly 50% of all traffic that are mobile now. It's a priority... it's just a priority for later.
Zoom and scroll works well on mobile... just counterintuitive bad layout.

This is the best response I've had so far. Thank you for giving me some direction.  Going to checkout bitstamp right now.
Any blog suggestions?
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:22:16
That's what I think too.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:55:11
I have some ideas about how to do it that need fleshing out.  I'm thinking about going to the bitcoin foundation with this idea eventually.
Trust seems to be the big limiting factor in getting this done. A decentralized exchange needs to mine trust the way miners hash sha256. A sort of Proof of trust instead of proof of work.

Happy for you. I wish I had your level of faith.  Do you still put money in?  I'm just throwing in as much as I don't care to lose every time I get paid for a job.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:43:05
Somehow I got through.  I had the window open and the sale waiting for me to confirm an updated price.  I didn't get all the coins I wanted but the sale went through at the right time.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:19:31
That's true if all the money changing hands is done by a central authority.  Really, though, if I posted a deposit only account number it really wouldn't be a big deal to get money in there.  It just takes time and trust that I'll recognize that **you** were the person that gave me the money and that **I** will do what you asked after the transaction is confirmed.

But it is annoying that I couldn't wake up and buy a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:25:48
Back in the day I worked with proportional, integral, and derivative loops. It's insane how similar that chart looks.

You can move your coins to a wallet or another exchange. Whatever happens to coinbase shouldn't effect you.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:28:11
On it.  And thanks again!
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:12:06
I bought my first bitcoin a week or so ago from coinbase and it hasn't gone through there, yet. Is there a chance that it never will? 
Coinbase seems to have had the fastest authorization service.  Is there an exchange I can buy into and start trading on today?
Maybe I should be looking for a blog to read the catch me up on what's going on.  Any suggestions?
Edit:  That transaction with coinbase went through 30 seconds ago!
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:23:02
This sounds centralized too.  Am i missing something?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:01:27
That happened in China recently, but I think the exchanges have a lot more to lose by doing that sort of thing
