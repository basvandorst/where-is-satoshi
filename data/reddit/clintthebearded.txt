But who is doing the liquidity part?
@_date: 2019-07-14 07:19:27
You need a Bitcoin wallet address of your own.  Best way is trezor or ledger nano s/x

All he must do is to move 1 btc. So anything else they say is just bs

Sounds simple. Remove the dot in your email and restart the process?

there is no where that you can pay for mining and get a decent reward. better to buy crypto on an exchange - cheaper. 
Best thing to do if you want recurring revenue, get an app called crypto.com - buy some BTC with it, and then stake it in their EARN portion. you can make up to 8% interest paid out weekly.
I have made over $1000 worth of various crypto in last three months there. hit me up if you want a referal - for a modest investment, you will get $50 USD free

To be honest, we stopped taking it since people did not like the high fees.

the scam works like this. they put up a nice flashy website. looks great, looks authoritive
They sell access to NON EXISTENT hardware - and then simulate a miner and say you have earned X BTC/$
Then, when you want to withdraw - they say you must pre-pay fees/taxes or other reasons before they will release your funds.
with any BTC transaction, the fees are paid from what you send.
Any other fee is just a lie
another version of this is Stock Trading - they promise to teach you stock trading for a fee (500USD) then simulate trades and all of a sudden you win so big, they call you up and tell you that in order to withdraw you must pay taxes or transaction fees. (they tried to do this to my father, it is how I know)
they had him convinced that he earned $5MUSD and that he must pay $100KUSD taxes before he could withdraw it.
Advanced Fee Fraud. - look it up.
FURTHER to this, if you spent any money with them already? get on to your credit card provider and tell them that the transaction was fraudulent as you did not receive what you paid for

Wow.  I don't know what wonderland you live in.  I would gladly move my business to a place that commands even just 100% Markup
Edit: markup on IT goods in .au is 15%-30% just against wholesale cost. 
Now.  Tell me,  which stone do I squeeze?
Oh and staff get goods at cost. Just a way I thank them.  Cash or crypto, but I won't wear the larger fees
Edit 2: And rethink my venture? I work my arse off to feed my family.  It's hard work,  but honest work.  Margins are what the market can bear,  but not good enough to give you a discount because you are out of touch with the reality of retail markup

the thing is that these guys are VISA approved and have demonstrated their compliance with gov regulations, they are being audited constantly. check them out. you may be suprised
@_date: 2019-09-20 07:55:48
There is no btc there, it is very likely an advance fee fraud site.  Just walk away
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:52:55
To you know the margins on it goods? Are you insane?
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:31:05
But only if you are prepared to discount by 20% so I've been told by /i/imalwaysrighthanded
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:36:36
Lol.  I'm in business to make money.  Not lose it.  Margins are tight.  I suppose I could Mark it up more  and discount for crypto payments? I cannot buy goods with btc, I need to pay cash for them.   Shame on me? SMH
