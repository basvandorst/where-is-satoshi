So I should move it out pretty regularly unless I'm going to be paying it forward? Guess I'll leave it there for now then and search for the perfect tippable comment. :P

Jesus man, what was the tab? $125?

aHa... this is used this way too, eh. Interesting. &lt;begins research&gt; Posted a moment ago here ( asking about this service, do they act like a wallet?
*edit* Okay, started an account on changetip but it doesn't look like it's really meant to be a wallet... just a kind of intermediary or some such...

A grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says, "Hey! We have a drink named after you!" The grasshopper says, "You have a drink named Steve?"  --Cortana
On a side note (another one), I'm little distraught about learning that I'm a dummy.

Gonna bust out my $1 on Changetip and go help some people out. ;) Thanks for the idea though. Who knows, maybe I'll be BTC wealthy one day... or normal wealthy. Or middle class..... DEAR GOD I WISH I COULD AFFORD A COMBO MEAL. (I'm good with the dollar menu.)
Peer to peer seems dangerous to me. Collateral better be worth much more than I'm lending.

I'm gathering that... from what I can see, the little $1.01 I have in there is prolly fine to keep there for now. :P

What is this?! A battle of sarcasm?! Muwhaha. Ha. Ha. I'll probably just end up finding someone to re tip my dollar to. :P Let that sad sap deal with losing everything. ;)

Unlike your post titles. :/

I don't really get the reference ( but being in the South, I can sure dig some Southern Belles. :-D

&lt;holds out hand&gt; Kidding. Kidding. I know way too little just yet to know quite what to do or how to even get that to my wallet. Hah! Getting there though, and I'm sure the process is likely as easy as withdrawing to whatever you tell them. Hope it would be that easy anyway.
**edit** Or do they not act as a wallet themselves?

Sometimes a fax is just needed.
Hmmm... might be better options for anonymous calling. I'll give it a look though. :)

I don't think you're grasping the full capability of a Swingline stapler.

Probably because Winky Twinks put it off and put it off and delayed as much as humanly possible. Interest faded.

2 years of following the currency - you should have some idea about what you're getting into with mining these days... and a lot of money to invest in rigs. You'll need hundreds to compete with directly with any group. Pools are generally a wasted effort.
