I was the one paying with the Amazon Gift card to receive bitcoins, so will I receive bitcoins if I am able to upload the evidence?

I just finished contacting Amazon and he had already used the money on the amazon gift card. Amazon was not able to do anything.

I don't care much for the $150, but I felt that the man getting caught was important.
@_date: 2015-12-07 23:09:42
That was my first plan because he said he would meet up during the transaction.

I'll contact Amazon right now. I'd rather purchase bitcoin through a reputable seller than trust the trader I dealt with

I didn't go through the normal localbitcoin system though. I texted him directly; however, after I sent him the gift card, he stopped messaging me. It has been about 3 hours since contacting him.

I definitely screwed up. His email was verified only 5 days ago with only one confirmed trade. In my texts, he did said he could meet in person on Wednesday, but I was too impatient and did the transaction over text.

Does anyone have experience with the police with scammers? I'm willing to go the full length, but I don't know if they'll have any power unless if they can track the phone number
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:43:35
I checked and noticed the trade is still ongoing.Is there a way to report him?
@_date: 2015-12-07 06:31:39
No, I did not prepare correctly. However, i have his phone number, which could be a burner. I have his email and localbitcoin account. I know he lives in the same city. And he was willing to meet in person, so I still have the benefit of the doubt. With this information, is there anyway possible to catch him.

I was new to localbitcoins. In the beginning, I opened a specific trade with him, but the texting seemed a lot more convenient. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 07:54:36
Damn, you were right about everything. So i just have to accept the loss and move on?
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:21:43
I'm in a very poor city for college, so the bitcoin community isn't really active. I'll try my luck on the forum, thank you.

It was unfortunately done outside of LocalBitcoins platform. I contacted the phone number under his terms. I still have his user account name and phone number. He had a 100% feedback score, and everything seemed official.

Thank you, I will probably contact Amazon tomorrow. I want to give the trader the benefit of the doubt and wait a day, but I feel useless if he is not contacting me.
