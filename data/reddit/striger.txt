public key and depositing coins don't seem to go together in public view. that would mean anyone could claim all the bitcoins in that wallet. could be fun to see it happen and see who gets richer first.  if some are dumb enough to keep doing that and i go back in and claim the money. could be like gambling at Vegas.
 i don't like my art work being destroyed. can you put a part of a blockchain in the painting and that becomes something of value? i guess it don't work that way.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:09:22
that was my recent thought as being the only solution. kind of like divinci code in paintings. could make the subject matter represent the numbers. like lots of number plates and sorts. could be a great puzzle painting. tell me, what happens when a person figures out the private keys? does that mean that person can claim those bitcoins and the painting is no longer useful?

so you're the one who gave me all those negatives. thanks alot
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:59:36
verrrry interesting!! i'll look into that one
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:00:41
how are those qr codes used? if you scan it, do get bitcoins and if another scans it after you, the bitcoin is gone, right?

I'm still a newbie even though i read a lot on bitcoins. i can understand halving. sort of like infinity zooming in. you can half forever in this universe. i still can't understand how mining makes money. easy to understand rewards but how do rewards turn into money. like if i have a paper dollar and miner cuts a 1/8th of an inch from the that dollar, how does the miner turn that back into a dollar or at least a penny? if a miner takes a penny from my dollar, i would have 99 cents. i would be a penny short at the dollar store.

\-don't understand that.
\-I have seen ...goat book cars meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
\-last word had many letters, why?
@_date: 2019-12-29 13:11:11
I would like a retweeter get some rewards or benefit. can that be done? some would want to keep the art for themselves while working on the puzzle. how can we get them to retweet/share the art for help? some sort of pool. like 5 people pooled on the same lotto ticket?
@_date: 2019-12-29 13:00:15
can't remember roll dices. might as well be random . but that was an interesting reply.
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:17:51
something like that. It was nice to see a link to the 2048 word list. I was hoping to paint the objects first and then list the objects but found restrictions on the words. It may be hard to find the words and then paint it.
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:52:03
ummm. if one pixel changes, you loose the whole thing.
@_date: 2019-12-29 11:05:59
I found this:
 [ 
I'm going to play with it to see what works or not.
I'm curious about how many words I can use.
I did see an = in an address. this site said letters or numbers. wonder if = works
@_date: 2019-12-29 10:04:25
\-create art.
\-put donation request with bitcoin address on art.
\-state that the objects in the art/painting contains seed phrases
\-those that solves the seed phrases gets the jackpot.
\-they keep donating and when the first winner sleeps, the second winner gets the Jackpot.
\-if no one solves the seed phrase, objects in the painting, Then I claim the jackpot.
\-the fun keeps going even after you die. so it may not be a total loss.
\-my question about the above is: is it legal and can it be done? why or why not?
@_date: 2019-12-29 12:38:07
 
 "Your Bitcoins Are Waiting in the Painting"
is quite catch line.
can anyone here suggest a catchline catch line like that?
@_date: 2019-12-29 12:46:10
-isn't it true that no addresses are alike?
-wouldn't the miners reject any two same addresses?
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:29:36
yeah, that is the point. 
I'm restricted to paint some of the 2048 words. not too random . I guess I can start with a flower and find words to paint around it.
@_date: 2019-12-29 12:57:03
I wouldn't want the puzzle to too difficult to solve like "Pa55w0rd". That might not be fair. Can an password keeper store secret addresses in other ways like putting words in plain view but have secret rules to read them? like write the words on the walls, out of sequence and have rules to decode them. like "bee car vet dime" and the rule is read them backwards like "dime vet car bee? what other ways to publicly store passwords?
@_date: 2019-12-29 13:04:32
bitcoin miners won't allow the same bitcoin to be used twice. How can a seed phrase, "happy birthday to you" be used twice? didn't a replier say nothing can be used twice?
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:25:37
I wonder how often and easy wallets gets cracked.
I had second thoughts on anything and everything when I learned Google's quantum computer. Was it something like what takes supercomputers 30 years to solve, the quantum thing takes 3 minutes. I might as well forget internet all together
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:42:15
scramble the numbers?
any tips?
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:50:51
most sites resample my image uploads. If I could find a way for buyers to buy and download my high res photos that has the details of those numbers, that would be GREAT ! like the buyer view a low res resampled image and buys it. then he would be able to access the high res that has the details. is that possible? I recently learned esty sells downloadable images but it watermarked. maybe esty would work. I haven't look deeper. Does anyone know where I could sell files like that?
@_date: 2019-12-29 10:52:08
can you use hashtag in your seed phrases? like     , etc
@_date: 2019-12-29 12:34:29
I can't prove I'm not the one who empties the wallet. I would think I'll miss the opportunity opportunity the empty the wallet like forgetting about it or like time pass.  that goes for the winner to. first come, first served type of thing. I'm worried a winner would create a program to constantly watch the address while he has the right to, being the winner.
 a comment above claims " That's not how it works. ". is he talking about the site or in general ? what site allows me to create seeds of my own? or is that possible?
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:32:02
I got that, thats. I wonder about my metamask. the fox scares me .
@_date: 2019-12-29 11:11:21
I was looking to type the seed phrases first and then get secret address made from that
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:44:40
yeah, I'm way too far to catch up. I'll just do art for now
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:40:04
oh yes! each would have it's own address.
Recently I learned blockchain art. it still blows me away.
oh!!!! wait! maybe a blockchain addresses can be the secret password. can that be done? perhaps a buyers address can be used. there are limited editions too meaning more numbers.
Is it possible to use a blockchain address as secret passwords?
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:11:07
I never really understood what a bitcoin looks like. I still visualize a block. I'm starting to think it's a very very very long block. I wouldn't call a road, "block". It's too long of a rectangle. Don't laugh at my imagination but I'm, at least, a common human that don't know those kinds of math.
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:20:47
I would think there are more transaction for every bitcoin made. Why would a mining station get so hot and cause brownouts, in a city, over 153  GB?
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:12:13
would miners need all those data?
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:03:53
can you post an example of what a bitcoin data looks like here?
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:33:00
you did good. I'll need to study what you said. thanks
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:14:00
I have some. If what you said was true then I wouldn't be able to ask that question, right? be honest in your language if you don't mind
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:32:14
sorry. I'm not too good with my words
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:22:43
thats right, I don't know"go". do you? now go!
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:01:01
how long does it take for bill to pass? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:17:42
what size would it be when all 21 million are used up. If I knew 21 million then why would redditisfullofasshol, in above comment, accuse me of not knowing at least that. I must automatically be an asshol.

Can someone have a super super super computer and mine to become a trillionaire
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:47:09
Go ahead and post them here
@_date: 2015-11-10 00:25:54
Oh gosh I give up on reading about bitcoins
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:53:45
How do miners know what other miners are doing? I still don't understand how all miners must go to one source to see the counts on bitcoins. Where is that one source?
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:46:16
Diaspora uses pods. Are nodes like pods? What does mining spend most of its time doing? Searching on nodes?
@_date: 2015-11-09 12:53:44
I never could understand how bitcoins have a limit and no more. How is the count of all bitcoins kept? Where are the records kept to control the bitcoins? What keeps bitcoins from going cover the limit or duplicate bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-11-10 00:27:16
So the more we mine and the deeper in the future, the harder it gets.
