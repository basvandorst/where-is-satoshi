If your definition of "alt-right" is racist nutbag, you'll be disappointed to know that there's really only a couple hundred of those, out of some 7-800,000 users, I don't know the exact number currently. Gab's solution to the few hundred: Let 'em all announce themselves clearly and then we _all_ know who they are. Posting threats and the like will get you banned, being a hateful prick won't—but it may not make you very many friends.

The issue is that there are finite transaction providers, and they're being systematically targeted. There are finite hosting providers, and they're being systematically targeted. They say, "if social media is being censored, create your own where censorship isn't permitted," but you cannot do that when the people doing the censoring literally control the servers, the payment processors, the literal wires that connect you to the internet itself, are all part of the censorship effort.

Crypto is promising, yes.

Anything illegal, threats of violence, doxxing, unlabeled adult content, and any form of child pornography (including loli hentai) are not permitted on Gab. Such posts are deleted. Repeat offenders are banned.
Of course I suspect a ban on Gab's is as effective as on Twitter: I used to maintain a mute list of all of neo-nazi dickheads I could find, about 300 in total. Every time I found a new one, I'd add them to find that my mute list was the same size. For every new one I find, one I already had seems to have lost their account. Huh. Right about 300 always.

Of course the other 800,000 users on Gab have figured out something you haven't: Banning the neo-nazis doesn't make them disappear, it just makes them communicate via whispers in the dark. When they spread their hate-filled poison to the gullible where nobody can challenge their bullshit with facts and logic, they can begin to indoctrinate and inoculate people against facts and logic. Y'know, like leftists do.
Gab is not a friendly place for nazis precisely because we all know who they are. And again, there's 800,000 of us to 300 of them. They can bluster, but it's not going to do them any good.

A broken clock is right twice a day, and even the usual grand high example of the most evil man to have ever lived (except for all of the people who are at least as evil, some of whom we've called "allies" at times, I mean) built highways while he was trying to depopulate Europe of anybody but blond-haired, blue-eyed Germans.
