When Central Banks start hoarding bitcoin, I'll buy bitcoin.  When Kings start wearing crowns made of bitcoin, I'll buy bitcoin.  When countries go to war over bitcoin, I'll buy bitcoin.  When scuba divers start risking their lives diving 200 meters down into the ocean to recover bitcoin, I'll buy bitcoin.  When rappers start getting bitcoins in their "grill" and wearing them around their necks, I'll buy bitcoin.  Until then, meh...not so much.

41% of electricity worldwide is produced by coal and peat.  So let's heavily increase global warming and CO2 emissions by running some useless mathematical formulas and a crazy need for electricity for a made-up currency.

Tonight you have professional traders joining the game and I'm pretty sure they are going to fleece the retail traders in Bitcoin like they do in every other market - Forex, corn, oil, precious metals, copper, wheat, et cetera.

It really is.  Someone lost a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:48:25
Here's the thing.  Most people buying bitcoin (on this site) have no experience trading.  Zero.  And they think they are going to out trade the professionals.  It's not going to happen.  True, bitcoin is the new sexy tech of the day, but railroads were once the new sexy tech of the day.  Trading is trading and unless you are good really good at it, then you probably shouldn't do it.  And it takes years to get good at it (like any other skill) and it usually involves lots of losses along the way - you learn from your mistakes.
Here's another hint, ask a bunch of traders what they think about bitcoin?  And, I don't care what they trade - oil, forex, gold, wheat, corn, pork bellies - ask them what they think.  I bet every single one of them says it's a bubble.
Good luck to you in your investing and speculating - enough of my rant.  :)

Nothing is bad.  Inflation is producing more currency.  Deflation is producing less currency.  Neither is "bad".  Prices fall in a deflationary environment, and prices increase in an inflationary environment.
Governments always want inflation because it's cheaper to pay their debts.  If you have large debts (like 21 trillon) it's much, much, much easier to create an inflationary environment (print lots of money) and pay off the debt with this new money.

Not at all.  We don't need to mine more gold, we have enough already.  Just divide the amount of USD by the amount of gold and back the currency with gold.  It will never happen because governments want to finance wars and projects with money they don't have but there is no need to produce more gold.

Because the 3 big markets - Asia, Europe, US - have markets which open at different times around the globe.  Most major hedge funds trade when their respective markets open.  Obviously, anyone can trade 24/7, but large trading desks (deep pockets) normally they don't do that.

Read - Devil take the Hindmost: A guide to financial speculation.  Reading books is great, but unless you get on a real market like Forex and start trading you're not really going to learn a lot.  A lot of trading is controlling your emotions.  The less emotions, the better.  Easy to control your emotions on a $10 trade, tougher on a $400k trade.  Risk management, controlling you losses and positions.  You'll get better every year, plus you'll see so many different setups, bubbles, and macro events that you will have a good feeling the next time you see something.

Futures market brings two things to the table - 1) Huge amounts of capital/leverage; 2) Professional traders.  BTC has been retail traders up until this point.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:07:07
They are experts.  They have been trading their whole lives.  Most people on here have been trading 2 weeks.  People here don't even know what an "in the money put option" is or a strike price?  Or, how to short a stock.  Maybe, just maybe, you should listen to the experts?  Or not.  
But the beautiful thing about trading is it's the most fair/equal field in the world.  There is no discrimination, no racism, no sexism, no one cares where you came from or your pedigree - all anyone cares about is the $.

LOL....it's not an enigma.  Crypto currencies aren't complicated, it's just the fallback position for the young to say "you don't understand it because you're old".  And yes, I'm 60+.  But, there were incredibly intelligent people in 1910, 1920, 1950, and even now in the millennial generation.  Every generation has intelligent people.  No generation has a stranglehold on intelligence.  Now, I will admit 300 level quantum physics was a little complicated when I was in college but I would venture to say it's still not an easy course in 2017.  Maybe a little easier with computers and youtube explaining it better than in my day.

No.  Think about it.  If 40,000 people buy bitcoin at $30,000 they are unlikely to sell below that point.  If one person buys at $30,000 the price can drop quickly because just that one person sells.  Volume is the key with price moves.  You want a lot of volume when the price moves.

Well, I'd appreciate any help in this matter as I'm trying to short it.  Normally, I short in the futures and you can take settlement of the asset - but not in this case.  Also, no options - out or in the money - put, calls, et cetera are available.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:53:53
Maybe the fact it went from $6k-$17k in a span of 30 days and it's overvalued?  Nah, that couldn't be it.  Probably fear of prime numbers.

Nah, that's just someone trying to cash out.  Trading is trading, I don't care if it's oil, corn, wheat, coal, forex, or crypto.  I can take a good trader in one market and they'll quickly adapt to be a good trader in another market.  And it's laughable that people with zero trading experience think they will beat the professional firms with 100 years of trading experience.  These firms will front run you, they see the order flow, they trade faster than you (nanoseconds), and have better analysts.

No, banks hoard it because:
1) 5,000 years as money
2) store of value
3) has no counter party risk
4) easily fungible
5) doesn't degrade over time
and too many other things I don't feel like listing.  And the simple fact that fiat currency has always collapsed in history.  No fiat currency has survived through modern times.  But assets like gold, silver, and oil have which is why they are a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:40:54
The shorting hasn't even begun yet.  Look at the volume, incredibly low, the whales (as you call them) can't even unload their bitcoin. 
Remember, real currencies trade on Forex which does $5 trillion per day.  Wait till this market really opens up to the big banks and hedge funds.  Then you will find what the market thinks about crypto.

There has never been a global currency, I'm sure crypto currency will be the first one.  After seeing all the problems with the Euro - only 28 member countries - I'm sure a global currency will work seamlessly with 400 countries.

Here's the devils advocate side - a bunch of young people who have a total trading time of 10 months on a very small market (crypto) think they understand trading better than professionals who have spent 40 years trading on huge markets like Forex, Futures, and the NYSE.
It's like little league players taking on the Yankees, but saying the "Yankees are old they don't understand this new way of playing baseball". 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:06:26
You are correct.  Mostly developed for farmers - think wheat growers, corn growers - who sell the product before they harvest it.  Thus, they are selling it in the future at a price today.  The buyer (speculator) takes all the risk trying to guess how much supply will be produced (wheat) and the demand for the crop (wheat) in the future.

Besides forex, which ones.  I only have experience with wheat, corn, gold, silver, and oil.  All of which can be settled in the asset, but 99.9% of the time is settled in cash.

No, XBT (BTC futures) is launched on the futures exchange at 6pm tonight.  So, in approx. 75 minutes.  However, it's Sunday night, so heavy trading will probably not happen until 9:30 am when the NYSE opens up.  Although, Asia and Europe can trade it all night on the futures.  Should be interesting to see what happens...??

Well, as far as I know, no one is shorting it.  If you know how, please let me know because I'm trying to short it.
The CBOE futures market isn't allowing settlement in bitcoin like a real futures market - oil, wheat, corn, gold, silver, et cetera.  And the option market will not let you trade puts or calls on bitcoin.
And, thanks in advance for any help  :)

Yeah, but I don't feel like joining another exchange and transferring a large amount of money to buy bitcoin in the Republic of Seychelles just to trade it.  I'm sure within the next couple of months one of the exchanges will come out with an option book.

For every article of a collapse in oil, I can show you two (2) that state oil is going back to $100 a barrel.  Considering how limited oil is on this planet, I doubt it's going down to $42.

Don't get mad, just plow all your money into bitcoin and prove them wrong.  If it's not a bubble, it will not collapse, and 30 years from now you will probably increase your investment.

6 months ago it was at $2k.  Since Sunday it has been open to a much broader market and the market doesn't want to buy it.  It's not going up even though many more investors can buy it.  Tells you one thing, it's going down, probably back to $2k where there is some support.

Mike, we agree to disagree.  I will short bitcoin and you go long and in the end, one of us will be right.
Off topic, I own a lot of solar stocks (ETF TAN) and have a lot of money invested in them.  Not that they are doing well, they are getting killed, but I feel like contributing to the betterment of the planet.  I would love solar to be the answer, but I'll probably be dead before solar makes any reasonable dent in the electricity demand of this planet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:58:33
But, in your example - wheat, corn, gold, oil, silver - normal futures markets, the contract can be settled by acquiring the asset.  In this market, not so much.  You can't acquire the underlying asset.  Which is why it's not a normal futures market and the price is skewed.  If this was the oil market and I thought the price was skewed I could close the contract, accept the oil (5,000 gallons), store it offsite, and sell it back to the market.  You can't acquire the underlying asset (btc) in this market - as far as I know?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:05:37
BTC is the leader in crypto currency.  It's akin to owning Exxon or BP in the oil world.  The largest and safest plays in that asset class.  If BTC collapses tonight (due to the futures market going live) so will the others.
