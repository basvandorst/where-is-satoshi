This is a stupid picture and fails to take into accout a host of factors.
Show people that bitcoin is amazing because of what it is. Hyperbole turns people away once they realize they aren't getting the total truth.

Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:42:06
Its all just code at the end of the day. Its only logical that if bitcoin doesn't implement a scaling solution someone else down the road will.

I agree on all accounts

It's ignorant to think that other crypto-currencies *may* find other scaling solutions or agree on one of the existing scaling solutions that currently divide the bitcoin community? There has been so much innovation in this technology in the last 5 years why is it so insane to think there won't be more innovation?

If bitcoin ends up as a parody of what it once was, then some altcoin will take its place as king of decentralized money. Blockchain technology is not gonna go away.

I dont know why it has to be like getting blood from a stone with crypto subreddits. Thanks for the level headed response

Sit on it for a few years. You'll be happy you did

What are your thoughts on securing a crypto network through Proof of Stake a la what Ethereum has proposed 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:41:42
This is doing it right. Good Job.
