Here is the answer. First contracts finish tomorrow. Whales sold low so need price low. Started a panic sell. Tomorrow once closed it will be pumped.

You sound like a child.
Adoption = success.

source? because i can see nodes running great.

When you open a channel, is it correct to understand that you can then transact with anyone else in the LN network (not just the person you opened a channel with)?

This is the thing I don't understand: why do people like premines? Why not just use $ or £? Isn't mining a fundamental aspect to decentralisation and cryptocurrency as a whole?

Lets say that I transfer 1 BTC to amazon through your channel.
How would Amazon collect that 1 BTC to their wallet, would they need to close their channel? Your channel wouldn't need to be closed? or would them closing their channel close yours too!?
Can't wrap my head around it, I need to spend time testing as you said but don't have time right now.

Are you all deluded asking how its bad news? 
Adoption = success.

I so hope that this becomes much clearer once released! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:08:59
Traders don't care though.

Bad news for bitcoin

Can lightning be thought of as your current account and your bitcoin wallet as your savings account therefore?

Funny how bitcoin will kill bitcoin.
Mass panic will set in soon, affect the whole cryptoworld. If I were part of core I would push for an increased block size whilst we await LN work to be finalised.

What a load of horse shit. How can you be free if you cannot buy goods with your bitcoin?
This sub needs to stop the bullshit. Bitcoin is amazing, but right now its simply broken.
If what you say is true then explain why there is Segwit and Lightning?

You seen the price today?

* they have a lot of work on their plates and cba to work around issues which could be solved by a 2mb block size whilst waiting for LN.
This is the problem with certain types of developer solving problems. They are so far detached from reality its hilarious.

which could be months, which is too long. Quick fix needed to save it IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:58:18
So you understand there are higher than average transaction volume today?
