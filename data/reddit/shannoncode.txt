Try pasting your transaction hex here:  I suspect your signatures aren't right. Maybe you've got multisig and have to sign twice or maybe change the order...

Oh! My adventures in Copay. I'm a developer for  and I have built a handful of tools for working with copay's oddities. 
One such tool is a way to brute force your encrypted backup. 
Another adds 2FA to copay using Google authenticator. 
Another migrates copay from using iDB to sqlite. 
The sqlite mod helps with another tool. 
The next tool is similar to brute force but instead of taking an encrypted blob and trying a ton of passwords, it takes an email address and a password and finds every record that it can encrypt (sometimes a user's wallets would become orphaned from the profile, this will find them) 
Here is the brute force tool:

OmniWallet also provides our statistics. Due to our recent drop we are transitioning wallets into the database as user's visit the site (hence the small number)
We currently have 110 that have been touched/created by a user and inserted into the database.

This fork was hastily done by me literally seconds after I found out someone had done the integration. (this was forked from the repository of the user who did the integration)
When you fork on github the repository is copied "as it existed" at the time of the fork. This means that any documentation is left intact.
I have begun work on a plugin system that will work with the main branch of vennd.io and limits the necessity to fork the repository at all in order to add "additional" features.

Do you guys see Factom as an alternative to sidechains, not related or complimentary?
