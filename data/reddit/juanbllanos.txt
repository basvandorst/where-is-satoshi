Thank you all, guys!  Did the best I could in 12 minutes.  sserrano44 helped me with the script, so kudos to him!

Me alegro de que te haya servido, voodah.  Cuando quieras... Mis datos están en blogdejuanllanos.com.  Saludos.

Wow.  Amazing discussion.  You've all given me a lot of food for thought.  It's greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2013-06-02 08:28:07
Well said.
@_date: 2013-08-02 00:19:11
Understood.  I was just figuratively referring to the fact that, once again, the customer interface will have to be redrawn to fit this new set of consumer protection regulations.

I would consider myself a pragmatic entrepreneur trying to make lemon out of lemonade.  But I'm biased.
@_date: 2013-07-12 18:59:32
Understood, but I, personally, had never seen in any prospectus ever before, the warning that the asset you're about to invest in may become illegal.  That was the ONLY point of my post.
@_date: 2013-06-01 17:27:31
My 2 cents on where we are today.
@_date: 2013-06-19 06:43:11
I appreciate all your comments, guys.  Let me clarify I'm only writing (or interviewing) on Bitcoin the payment medium, NOT the currency.  And because I live and work in the US and advise entrepreneurs with a genuine interest in creating something of value, I'm just bringing to your attention the boundaries within which it's legal to operate in the US.  Needless to say, you can do whatever you choose, only just be ready to face the consequences.  If you have a great idea  and you want to pitch it in the US, it'd better be legal.  VERY legal.  Just my POV.  
Thanks all for reading, debating and making history by being pioneers!

pyalot, ask Google, Facebook, Paypal, Amazon and Square if compliance is easy.  Why do you think the Zuck hired Sheryl Sandberg?  Why do you think they all pay millions in lobbyists every year?  Give it a bit more thought.
@_date: 2013-09-05 14:29:26
That's one of the things that's not clear and all of us should have the government clarify.  
@_date: 2013-06-03 21:37:52
Jesset77, that's EXACTLY what I said in the article.  You're actually making my point.  Why the anger?  Just trying to help.

Thank you, knight222.
@_date: 2013-09-03 16:17:24
Thanks, all, for the feedback and recommendations.  I'll include them in next month's edition.
@_date: 2013-09-05 14:30:34
Right.  In money transmission there's no threshold.  If you send $0.01 from A to B and charge a fee, you are a money transmitter.  Of course, the government will always go after the bigger fish first.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:56:53
Thanks for your kind feedback, drcross.
@_date: 2013-09-05 14:34:07
Thanks, jedunnigan, for your common sense and critical thinking.  Much needed in this world (now I am talking about the world).
@_date: 2013-08-10 00:00:41
Thanks for the kind feedback, jmendeth.  I'm not sure if the situation will get to the point that the Bitcoin protocol itself needs to be altered (although that's already happening -see version 0.9).  What does need to happen is the 'hardening' of the customer interface, as I call it -strong ID procedures on both ends of the transaction.
@_date: 2013-06-03 22:02:10
I disagree it's misleading.  In case it's not clear, what I meant to say is the whoever had dreams that Bitcoin could be entirely anonymous should wake up, and realize that the CUSTOMER INTERFACE will have to comply with applicable law, and that means, that there has to be some degree of customer data capture and verification.  MtGox is already doing it! 
@_date: 2013-09-05 14:41:50
Thanks, jedunnigan, again for being the voice of reason.  People will eventually grow up to learn that you cannot build a business (or anything) on emotion.  Or they won't and instead will perish (not before whining, though).
@_date: 2013-08-02 00:28:31
Wow.  Very enlightening discussion, everyone.  Thank you all for this!
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:54:06
They've taken step 1 of the FEDERAL layer of regulations.  The next step is to build a substantial back-office operation (an anti-money laundering "program").  They had better be buttoning up on the STATE side too, which means obtaining licenses where required (state of residence of customers or place of business, depending on the state).  Currently, only three states do not required licenses in the US: Montana, New Mexico and South Carolina.  Operating without a money transmitter license is a federal crime in the US!

Alain, John, Great project.  I'm an AML and payments exec working on a similar project.  Would you guys want to chat off line?
@_date: 2013-07-12 18:56:51
A lot has changed since March 18, 2013, when the US government designated all virtual currency exchangers as money transmitters, thus bringing them into the fold of existing anti-money laundering regulations applicable to value transfer systems.  Among those are the obligation to obtain, verify and retain customer identification, a basic requirement known as KYC or Know Your Customer.  Welcome to mainstream financial services!
@_date: 2013-06-28 15:16:29
Summary version of the rather long interview: 
@_date: 2013-06-28 15:18:11
The only US state that currently do not require licensing are Montana, New Mexico and South Carolina.
@_date: 2013-08-02 00:34:11
Just to clarify, guys, it's not the network (Visa, MC, Amex) that's responsible to cover fraud losses, but the financial institution providing the service.  As iwilcox states below, this may not be such a big issue after all, if the right safeguards are put in place.
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:26:50
Good question.  My timeline includes events that relate to compliance, regulatory and business risk (i.e., threats).  I guess SecondMarket's announcement could tangentially be considered a risk event, but with a positive slant.  Thanks for pointing out.
@_date: 2013-08-02 00:32:09
You're probably right, iwilcox.  This may not be a big deal.  My goal was just to make people aware of the consumer protection regs, and the need to factor them in on their product design, which is NOT the case today.  Some of us (money transmitters) are already complying with those regs, even before the October deadline.  (You're right, it really is not a big deal to delay the transfer for 30 minutes!)  However, none of the exchanges that I've tried are doing anything of the sort right now.  My goal is just to add value by creating awareness, even at the risk of stating the obvious.  Thanks for your comment!
@_date: 2013-09-05 14:20:44
Hey, plato14.  I'm sorry about your frustration.  I have a solution to your problem: stop reading me!  Problem solved.
In the meantime, all of us who care about making things work, however shitty the world is, we'll continue to do so.
Good luck!

@_date: 2013-06-28 15:16:01
True.  What there is out there is not a level playing field.  It benefits some (the bigger ones), hurts others (the much more numerous long tail of small players).
@_date: 2013-09-05 14:26:15
Very much on point, jmw74.  I've said several times that anyone in Satoshi Square should listen out for the rattle of handcuffs.  Seriously.  
@_date: 2013-06-03 21:25:48
Maybe.  There's some inaccuracies, but directionally, it's correct.  Trust me.

I don't disagree.  I've never talked about Bitcoin the currency, but mostly about Bitcoin the service and the fiat vs. virtual conversion, which is what makes companies doing it financial institutions and, therefore, subject to US regulation.
