Real or not, pretty cool story.
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:47:13
For me, it's not about money. Sure I love getting and spending it, but what bitcoin represents is far bigger than just economics. Think P2P EVERYTHING. Once you get some intuition around this, you can't look at the world the same.

Sometimes, like times like this, I actually like humans. It's nice to know there are still good people in the world
@_date: 2014-06-17 06:01:53
I triple check it even when I send a few mbtc
@_date: 2014-11-24 13:07:41
will we ever know?

Cryptogenic Bullion. The dev pulled out of the project out of nowhere. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 04:55:45
South African bitcoin exchanges are also not great. Hopefully Xoin will change that. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:27:49
I still think the real problem is easily buying coins from anywhere around the world. I can't buy coins without needing to verify my proof of address, ID and other tasks. I want to be able to be able to buy bitcoin as easily as I can buy something with bitcoin. I know it's not gonna happen, but we should aim for that.

Decentralised Internet. So decentralised decentralised broadcasting 
@_date: 2014-09-08 20:37:45
That's not what I mean. I'm not actually gonna sell my account, but if I had to price it that would be a minimum. It's extremely difficult to build solid rep, which is why it's more valuable than btc. I'm not saying I'm gonna 'cash out' if that's what you got from my comment.
@_date: 2014-09-21 07:55:39
Sure, while it may be stupid,  we need people like Joe sixpack to get on board. Psychologically,  people are gonna find it more rewarding to have 100k bits than 0.1BTC. We get it, they don't.

A brain wallet is a really bad idea!
I suggest, a piece of metal with the private key engraved and that be held in a secure remote location. 
Good luck!

Do you ship to south Africa?
@_date: 2014-12-19 09:24:46
You can get a ton of btc if it's in good condition. The error ones go for a lot.
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:48:43
amazing! I have had my eye on this for a while, but since I'm still noobish at programming, I won't be able to help.

Using bits as a denomination would work
@_date: 2014-08-22 04:59:56
Seriously this book is insanely good! I'm almost finished reading it. Are there any more like this?
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:10:55
If I bought some reeces,  hoe much would it approximately cost to ship?
@_date: 2014-02-01 11:36:39
it would take much more to do that again. The amount of fiat needed to do that is insane 
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:56:04
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:40:09
I wouldn't say that. I had 3btc in alt coins and it crashed so bad. I had to sell for 1.3 btc.  Sad 
@_date: 2014-01-26 15:59:07
I'd love to be able to use bitcoin in a lot more shops around here. I've only walked into one shop that accepts bitcoin here in cpt
@_date: 2015-03-18 10:24:56
Where did you get one?
My number: 2384
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:56:11
Of course, freshly mined but with 1 or 2 previous transactions.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:40:54
The amount of generous people here makes me tear up a bit. And I never tear up. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 16:25:06
If mining does start to die difficulty will drop and people will pick it up again and so on. Until all bitcoins are generated then maybe people will stop. Unless they want transaction fees 
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:58:15
If I had the BTC I would so buy it. PE isn't thaaat far lol
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:00:44
Some strange things going on at Just-Dice
@_date: 2013-09-10 18:02:42
If I were in your shoes, I would have probably done the same thing, even though it's easy for me to say that I wouldn't have.
@_date: 2013-09-29 11:00:52
so they're basically normal tokens representing assets, and the tokens are issued by private companies? This idea isn't very clear to me
@_date: 2013-10-20 07:20:32
I wonder when this wil ever die down 
@_date: 2013-10-06 14:45:27
I lurk on the forums and stuff, there's about ~20 people that seem to be really interested in bitcoin. And most of them aren't in the same province :/
@_date: 2013-09-11 16:27:07
there's more South African people? :D feels like I'm the only one here who knows about this :(
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:36:32
Aah I wish I could come. November is crunch time for me, cannot go anywhere
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:20:28
I always wondered about this, I'm sure at some point there will be a big hash rate drop. It's almost never profitable. Well, so far.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:14:36
did you get charged customs fees? I'd probably have to pay a huge tax
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:37:19
Flip I didn't add my email to my new wallet, I hope there's still sometime before the move on
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:50:11
Still nothing in CPT?
@_date: 2013-09-24 16:01:27
holy crap :| this only happens in the bitcoin economy
@_date: 2013-09-21 15:52:04
really cool. probably gonna confuse people with the name tho
@_date: 2013-10-20 09:59:33
I would use this exchange!! It's gonna be a great addition for everyone. 
Can I get reddit gold? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:47:49
Would be interested in one as well please
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:36:17
I wonder what Casascius is gonna say about this. I haven't seen any of his posts yet
@_date: 2013-07-04 18:25:29
nice and polished! :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:07:26
cryptsy is a lot better now. And the audit feature works great
@_date: 2013-10-13 18:23:33
1 BTC from faucets? How long did that take?
@_date: 2013-09-15 20:30:36
this is really awesome! I wish I could find stuff like that here
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:44:45
Gareth Emery is flipping awesome! 
@_date: 2013-09-11 17:54:07
Awesome! Where are you located? JB or CPT?
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:38:23
This is awesome! Now I can finally sell bitcoin and withdraw into a bank account here. Thanks guys!! 
@_date: 2013-10-27 13:33:01
Mine late and stuff and sell before it hits an exchange
@_date: 2013-08-17 11:30:26
I would use the QT but the internet connection we have here is super super slow to be able to use (~80 - 100 kbps) so it just makes sense to use inputs.io or blockchain. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:46:37
read up on Madesparq, the project is exactly that. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 07:28:18
Not sure about you but I think the 'mill' would be confused with 'million' every now and then
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:34:33
So I can buy things on thinkgeek with btc? :D
@_date: 2013-10-06 09:43:15
I would love to go to conferences like this :/ but alas, nothing is happening in this country
