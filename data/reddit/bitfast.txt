Clarification  
We never kept any private key on Android devices. We have an optional PIN functionality that uses AES256 to encrypt the key (mnemonics) with a random key into an encrypted blob.
Even if an attackers gets hold of it and bypasses Google's encryption it has only 3 PIN attempts before GreenAddress deletes the AES password from the server and the PIN can be 10+ digits.
GreenBits, our main Android wallet has the back up functionality already disabled and the older GreenAddress Cordova app has been addressed yesterday and will be delivered in the next release.
We are also working on an improvement to invalidate any encrypted blob per device every time the user does a PIN login so that even if an attacker gets hold of it the password has already been deleted.

For what is worth I notified Apple and the Appstore for most of these but don't let that stop _you_ from contacting Apple, the more people complain to them the faster they may notice and remove the fake wallets..

Thank you for sharing.
I have notified the AppStore about 12h ago both via  and their AppStore page on Facebook.
Looks like the app is down now (at least for me)
This is the third app we report in less than a week and there have been a few other impostor apps stealing bitcoins on the app store (breadwallet, [android] bitcoin wallet, armory, core, bitgo,  greenbits/greenaddress, etc)
If you invite someone to use a wallet please give them the full link to the app or to the developer site and in general tell them to be wary of phishing attacks; 
Unfortunately this trick already costed some user quite a lot on a fake breadwallet clone:

If you want to try to run it on Android (very experimental/alpha) I've updated [ABCore]( to support this release candidate (and will update to the final as soon as it is available)
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:46:16
For those that want to try to experiment with it on Android I released an updated version ([v0.49]( of [ABCore]( with the final version of Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 as released.
This app is experimental, use at your own discretion and only use this under WiFi/cable or if you don't mind downloading lots of gigabytes for the blockchain over mobile data.
edit: For those that wonder if the app verifies the packages: yes it does, the packages are pinned/fixed/hardcoded in the [code]( and match the ones [released]( by the Core team - if it doesn't match the app fails to configure itself.
@_date: 2016-04-11 12:45:39
Actually for GreenAddress with email or SMS 2FA you do get to see the address and amount (and email supports GPG optionally) before you authorise the transaction and the whole point is being able to make transaction even if an attacker manages to compromise one of your devices (for the attacker to compromise you they'd have to compromise both the computer/mobile with the wallet as well as the one you used for 2FA); 
With Google Authenticator you don't get to see the address but we felt it was an option that people wanted so kept it. We do inform users that the other options are better (at least for security purposes but with GPG even the privacy isn't too bad)
We are addressing all the instability issues reported, a newer version of the app for iOS has been submitted to the iTunes store and in general we have many improvements in the pipeline to the user experience, performance, privacy and security.

^ re: GreenAddress, we have an android mobile app entirely native (i.e. java and some jni libraries) and we are moving towards that model for various reasons (security/performance/code reuse) so once we reach feature parity for the native app the mobile JS app may be deprecated.
Keep in mind that there's a bit of a blur for what is a web app and what isn't, you can use native libraries like libsecp256k1 in mobile JS apps (or chrome apps for that matter) and on the other hand desktop/mobile Qt apps can be written in QML + JS/css web tech though are traditionally not considered web apps.

Hello and welcome to GreenAddress!


The risk is that someone with your mnemonics and nlocktime presigned transactions can take your funds but both are necessary.


Gentle is on GitHub and a few people have forked it, even so, if not available or not functional it is possible to use some libraries/tools to do the same thing (some volunteers from bitcoin.org I think actually even tried it); while it may not be simple for the average Joe any developer can do it with a couple of hours of work at most.
Let us know if you have any other question!
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:29:49


The amount of transactions on the [litecoin blockchain]( is comparable to the one on the [bitcoin testnet]( as you know litecoin mining is not ASIC/FPGA/GPU resistant as originally suggest and doesn't seem to bring any significant development to the scene.
If bitcoin is high risk, litecoin is certainly a lot riskier.
@_date: 2016-04-12 18:37:24
Thank you!
Though we think there's a lot to be improved and we are working to do just that :)
If you have any feedback on things or suggestions please let us know!

There is a final screen to review the transaction before confirming, including fee and all.
If you want anonymity while we do support Tor and have onion addresses for both mainnet and testnet you probably want to run your own node if you want that level of privacy/anonymity, at least for now :)

If you have proof feel free to send me a link, either here in the public or in private but if you don't have proof you are just spreading despicable FUD.
XT on the other hand is moderated because it is considered an altcoin (and an attack on the Bitcoin network for that matter) so I can see a big difference.

Bitcoin can't survive without fees, the fact that at first fees were negligible doesn't mean this is sustainable, does it?

Code like RBF does and there may be different versions of similar code written by different people run by different miners.
It seems like the incentive for miners will be to run with something like this and as more miners use it other miners will follow, although i can also imagine some miners will promise not to double spend some transactions (say they have a contract with a big payment processor)
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:57:47

I never said that the intrinsic limitation is the 1MB max block size.
The intrinsic limitation is that the network is O(n^2) and thus you can't scale with the block size, the block size is the last thing to be touched if Bitcoin is to scale.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:46:07
It may be higher than XT, the point is that Core clients won't notice XT and won't upgrade to XT.
Miners that run Core but signal XT may do that to cause a minority of the miners to waste the bandwidth on orphans - China is well positioned to do this given they have together more than 55% of all hashing power.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:13:04
miners can implement it completely independently of Peter Todd or Bitcoin Core for that matter.
And they have the incentive, it was just a matter of time and we may as well avoid relying on things we shouldn't rely on

"...the worse case scenario is the economic majority is in favour but miners are not, we would ignore the longest chain, we would force it with checkpoints to make the 20MB blocks..."

@_date: 2015-12-03 21:08:14

we are bound to hit it anyway, sooner or later and we may as well make the changes we need to handle (disclaimer, we already made changes to handle dynamic fees and we are going to make changes to support RBF and CPFP)

I am not part of blockstream and nor is Peter Todd (which by the way, disagrees on using sidechains as he finds them too insecure compared to Bitcoin's blockchain!) but we all agree that increasing the max block size right now would lead to a terrible increase of centralization, so what gives?
Try to look at the bitcoin development mailing list, people have been providing data that support the idea that increasing the block size is something we shouldn't do right now.
@_date: 2015-06-25 13:26:22
I am sure you took great efforts in working against double spends but unless you wait for confirmations before the user can operate on the exchange post instant deposit, in the scenario I described above, you would find out about the double spend and act on it when is would be too late. 
This is obviously not a big concern if you only allow very small amount instantly and block accounts when you detect double spends and wait for final confirmations before allowing any withdrawal.

Welcome to reddit! 
No, GreenAddress never had any contract or payment with Peter Todd. If we where to have come consulting with him I wouldn't be afraid of saying it, I think he is very qualified. 
Our position is that the max block size should only be increased when other Bitcoin core performance characteristics  have been improved and anyhow when there's consensus and the risks for contentious hard fork is as minimal as humanly possible.
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:32:20

There has never been censorship on BIP101, it was always allowed however Theymos has said that in this subreddit it is not allowed to attack bitcoin or otherwise promote an altcoin implementation that tries to take over bitcoin without consensus.

@_date: 2015-12-07 19:08:50
You are assuming if the altcoins reaches 75% voting it means it reached 75% consensus when nothing could be further from the truth.
Miners can vote XT just to screw up the XT miners. For instance, 49% of the miners could vote for XT until it fork but they actually run core and won't follow up on the vote.
The reason they would do this is because mining is a zero sum game and if some miners are wasting their money on an altcoin it means that the bitcoin miners have more to take.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:45:18

@_date: 2015-12-07 20:11:04
What protocol?
75% blocks doesn't mean it's consensus, it's just 75% of the last blocks, which can be gamed by a miner that wants to make the XT miners waste their time (and miners have said that if something is profitable to do inevitably it will be done)
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:55:32
You can use a url that protects your xpub and provides addresses via https.
With [GreenAddress]( you can give to your employer a url like [this]( that you can find in your "Receive Money" section under "Show advanced options" within a GreenAddress wallet and they can pay you each time on a different address.
They just need to click on Show or Show QR Code and they will see a freshly generated address.
A few websites have been using it for donations and while it is not the ideal long term solutions for HD wallets it is a decent mid-term solution.

@_date: 2015-06-20 16:46:59
I disagree, you don't know which side will lose money, if 70% of the miners that advertise XT are fake you are going to be on the wrong side and waste hashing power on orphans if you run XT ...
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:03:12

No, most people support an increase in capacity or otherwise in tx/s.
Gavin or Mike have vastly underestimated the risks involved, undermined the BIP process and are misrepresenting what they call the _other_ camp or the 1MB camp, as if people really care about a certain size other than for decentralization and security purposes.

@_date: 2015-12-01 19:29:58
What some are failing to understand is that there is no loss for zero-conf functionality or anyhow not more than any loss that zero-conf functionality would have incurred if there was to be a change to the min relay fee or the min dust rule or yet other mempool changes like limiting it to a certain size sorted by fee, etc
You argument is valid for full RBF, hence the proposal for first seen safe rbf and then opt-in rbf which is better than first seen safe while not impacting zero conf more than a min relay fee change (one just happened recently in 0.11.x for example see 
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:42:50


Yes, you are right! But Bitcoin is different because it relies on consensus to work.


With Bitcoin consensus Bugs hardly get fixed because an hard fork to fix them is more risky than working around the bugs.

Can you find a solution to remove the incentive from miners to run this?
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:42:12
Not everyone has the same priority and not all wallets will aim for the first block, it's more likely that wallets will aim for 2nd or 3rd block so that there is space for improvement (and your transaction may still get included in the first block)
Your example doesn't really make sense, if everyone is paying 1000$ in fees it means that everyone has the same kind of priority which is far from true - look at the load of blocks, there's high peak and off-peak fullness and the same would apply to fees.
@_date: 2015-06-25 13:13:28
it's not about what they want or don't want
those tools are necessary in all regards as you can't expand the block size beyond what the network can afford to stay sufficiently decentralized, if 1MB is simple to fill so is 8MB or 20MB and thus some people will find those tools needed anyway.

Are you suggesting that BIP65 or any other soft fork we had was contentious, especially compared to the block size debase?
In the BIP65 case a 49% miner can get screwed since 51% will actually go with BIP65.
In case of BIP101 there is no doubt it is a very very contentious thing where likely many disagree already, miners can take advantage of that in a serious way

Bitcoin and in particular the blockchain doesn't scale with increasing the block:  it should be the last resort, after all its an O(n^2) network!

The block size should not be unbounded, to have value it has to be scarce and without a bound there can't be a functioning fee market which is itself needed by miner to survive long term.

As true as that may be it is not possible to safely vote, core can vote for 20MB as if it XT with a small change but still do small blocks only and viceversa XT can vote for 1MB while still prepared to do 20MB.
In the end, you can still have a hard fork even if Gavin tries hard.
@_date: 2015-06-16 08:40:05


I don't think you can rely on things like that.
A few miners could decide independently to signal up-version blocks while not accepting blocks bigger than 1MB, causing &lt; 75% XT miners to start mining bigger blocks with maybe say just 40% hashing power - something bad for both Bitcoin and the new alt. 
Viceversa, someone suggested some miners may think it's a good idea to signaling current block version while using XT. 
As a defensive measure against contentious hard fork some Bitcoin core nodes operators may decide to detect XT (trivial because of getutxo) and make sure it keeps the connection alive while feeding it nothing, no transaction nor blocks, effectively increasing propagation latency and even isolating XT nodes.
Releasing a contentious hard fork can only end badly for everyone in the space.

It does prove something: "the effects of larger blocks on centralization pressure of the system".
It may be obvious to you but not to everyone.
What you seem to be missing is that a large increase in max block size can immediately be a problem if some miners in the west start producing large blocks orphaning the majority of the hash rate in China and causing the network to be that much less secure (and besides, more centralized)

Yeah, some miners may decide to move, others to join, from a $$ prospective, at least short term, sounds like the incentive is to stay.
Some people may decide to abandon Bitcoin completely because of this but if not enough of them do then miners will simply continue to do it, and basically you have no way of stopping them.
Some miners have their own private pools and don't depend on external miners connecting

Citation needed, consensus is that they would be disastrous.

@_date: 2015-06-01 22:24:50


That's not what happens. Nothing comes to a halt. Transactions are confirmed as per their priority (which is a mix of coin age and miner fees). As far as I know GreenAddress transactions (which use smart fee unless manually specified) don't have a problem getting confirmed with the next or the block after at most.


Because we can't grow it indefinitely, it would never be enough to accommodate global usage on its own, it needs a limited block size tweaked well enough for decentralization and some layer two on top which scales better than touching the block size (and it exists, lightening network, is very sound and being developed)

Mike thinks its fine if Bitcoin is run like Google runs gmail, I disagree, his expertise is not very useful in a decentralized system.
I think it pointless just like it is pointless to say that Gavin is affiliated with MIT.


Arguing that people that contributed to the development of Bitcoin have more background to judge this decision is not arguing from authority, far from it.

I am not arguing that bigger blocks won't allow for more transactions on the blockchain, that's obvious.
I am arguing that there is no agreement, that forcing a hard fork without consensus can lead to bad bad things and that there is no point in having a huge block if the blockchain loses its decentralization.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:16:10
even the best reimplementation (btcd) keeps finding consensus issues with the library - if you use something which then isolates you because of bugs it's up to you - or do you expect to run 3 different implementations on your phone?

As long as it is not handled like a centralized system scaling because it ain't and it shouldn't become one.
Mike is trying to make the other looks like they don't want bitcoin to scale while the truth is that the others he is referring to did all the work to make bitcoin scale and they are careful with the max block size because of the centralization implication.
Mike showed his true colors in his latest interview when he declared he will put centralized and hardcoded checkpoints in XT and bitcoinj to ignore the chain with more work if it's not XT.
Since he is there, why not talking the bitcoins that went to pirate40 or that were stolen from MtGox?

That, well, depends, Core has all the incentives to upgrade to the same block version number or higher if there is an attack/contentious hard fork - in fact, it has probably the right to defend itself and isolate the few XT nodes available cutting them off from the network completely.

My opinion is that we should have a cap, we should have fee pressure with fuller blocks and we should keep it at 1MB until we have enough improvements to Bitcoin Core to allow an increase without damaging its decentralization and security properties.
Some suggested that even when the network can handle it we should wait until the fees stop to rise to increase the max block size but I think it would be ok to do earlier as long as there is consensus.
I am fully opposed to contentious hard fork such as the one outlined by Gavin or Mike in BitcoinXT (but I would be equally opposed to any contentious hard fork caused by Core too) 
@_date: 2015-06-20 10:58:40


That shows you don't understand how GreenAddress works. We can just guarantee that the attacker won't be able to double spend for about a day / 144 blocks and that the fee is sufficient to be included in the first block at the time the transaction is broadcasted, we can't make transactions that won't confirm confirm.


Just because we know zero confs are not safe doesn't mean we are pushing for double spends, we just happen to believe RBF is inevitable.


Bitcoin stands on its own as always, you just have to accept the risk if you go zero conf or accept the friction and wait for confirmations. Or make your own payment channel. Or wait for lightening. Or use Coinbase.


If anything that would be the market deciding that bitcoin transaction are really valuable. Fees can't possibly reach that amount without the price of bitcoin rising accordingly. I think people just want to avoid to trade Bitcoin's decentralization and security properties for scalability ala Paypal - THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH!


People can already change this, it's not part of the consensus; these amounts are just defaults, there are nodes and miners that use different values.


I don't see any proposal like that anywhere, are you talking about something specific or is this just your great imagination?


Trolling again?


well, the other side is all about "OMG let's tweak this one parameter and everything will be fine, next time we hit the full block we can just do it again!" - what's the point again of the block size limit if it is raised again and again each time we hit the block? 
You do know that if we were to remove all limits the market would become more efficient, to the point where we have 1 miner left that can handle increasingly bigger blocks.


What are you taking about now, block size limit or RBF?
Either way, RBF can't be blocked and the block size limit, as demonstrated by recent simulations and real life tests shows it should probably not be increased right now, especially not with a contentious hard fork.

You don't know that for sure, Core can easily say it is running the same block version as XT making XT start at much lower thresholds than 75%.

Who am I now, your assistant secretary?
I insist one should listen to all proposal and judge based on what degrees of decentralization one finds acceptable for himself and everybody else and how much risk is one willing to not only take for himself but also for everybody else.
I am not sure I know anyone _against_ a block size increase, I know people that think that right now it would be wise to learn more about it with analysis and testnets networks to find the right balance so that when the block size increase is needed and advisable we all do it in consensus - and I agree with them wholeheartedly.

Both sidechains and lightening work with 1MB but don't scale without a bigger block size.

stop it with this crap, this is not about Blockstream and as far as we understand it there is no reason to believe that Lightening won't work.
just because the network has not been attacked yet doesn't mean that when the block size will be increased it won't be attacked

It isn't Greg vetoing anything, that's not how Bitcoin works.
There simply is no consensus in increasing the max block size any time soon and *Gavin* can't veto anything either, he's nobodies [benevolent] dictator.
The important thing is that there is consensus in not going ahead with Gavin's proposal by the entire core team (but Gavin) and not only them but also likes of Peter Todd and myself and the company I work for (GreenAddress).


A working Bitcoin blockchain is preferable to a non working Bitcoin Blockchain, simple as that.
 &gt; He specifically said he was going to step back to do planning on capacity and scaling. Which part of him saying did you miss?
He can say whatever he wants but what matters to me is that he hasn't contributed in the last year and that Bitcoin is not a centrally planned system. If he wants to make changes he has to use the same method we used in the last 4years, he needs to create a BIP and gather consensus.


Not really, the way bitcoin works is that you can never deterministically know when a transaction will end up in a block, however making changes that the network can't handle and that have no consensus whatsoever is damn stupid as it can destroy or delay Bitcoin by many years.


Not at all, a hard fork can destroy Bitcoin, some fee pressure can't destroy Bitcoin, we already had it when the block size was 250k, it works just the same and is the only way we think Bitcoin will work as the subsidize of the block reward halves.

@_date: 2015-06-11 20:52:16
What needs helping right now is wallet developers to support floating fees and replace by fee and child pays for parent so that when blocks are full they can decide how long they will wait.
Keep in mind that bitcoin has peak and offpeak transaction volumes so people may decide to wait or pay more fees if they want to transact with a certain priority.
Full blocks can happen whether we have 1MB or 20MB limits and Bitcoin can't and won't scale by indefinitely increasing the block size, it simply can't, the network is O(n^2)

And they are obviously not even good at that given Litecoins P2SH forgot to change enough when copied that it uses the same addresses as Bitcoin. The alts are pretty much all technically and economically inferior in a way or another, like PoS.


Obviously they don't even know about the rest of the Bitcoin technical community, some know Mike and just about everyone knows Gavin - who is using his media recognition as his political weapon of choice. And Mike and Gavin like to underestimate the risks as we all know.

I don't think there is any delay if you use a wallet that use dynamic fees (like Bitcoin Core, GreenAddress &amp; GreenBits).
If there was a huge burst of transactions with higher fees than yours then you would need a mechanism to update the fee - hence RBF &amp; CPFP

Yes, bitcoin works thanks to computers and the internet and so do some Google service but things are very different.
Google can run great data centers with great connectivity pretty much anywhere it likes and while it relies on multiple servers the service itself is provided by a centralized entity.
Bitcoin doesn't work like that. It's not centralized nor it should be, we already have Paypal with its servers all over the world but we shouldn't adopt Paypal policies in Bitcoin.


All I am saying is that the experience in using computers and running servers from a centralized company doesn't apply to scaling a decentralized service, I am not arguing that you don't know how to run a scalable centralized service, I am arguing that you don't know how to run a scalable decentralized service and no, it doesn't make me feel better.


I believe others have already done that more than eloquently, likes of Greg, Sipa, Todd on the bitcoin dev mailing list as well as reddit and irc.
In short, I fundamentally disagree on zero conf security (I think RBF is already working reasonably and I have reasons to believe its use will increase), I think mempool can be bounded and be prioritized by fee and coin age. 
Once the fees stops growing and if the network can handle it we should and if there is consensus we should attempt to increase the block size (assuming no other solution that uses the block space more efficiently is found).
 
I am not a fan of disrupting zero conf while people migrate off but I can't believe there are [developers]( who are actually suggesting people could rely on these. 


One could argue that the same applies to you and Gavin. You handwave that it is not a problem while you know it is a massive risk.
I see no evidence of the block size being an imminent problem and I also have no problem believing that you and Gavin are very good at promoting your ideas and talking to the businesses or the media but that doesn't make you right.


They have done more for bitcoin than you or Gavin I am led to believe from total contributions and I don't think they are vetoing, they are saying we are going to do it calm down, it's not the right time because now it would be bad for a series of reasons especially if you are still thinking of a 2000% increase cliff jump.


Well, from the video i linked in my last comment you say that you spoke to a lot of wallet and talked about increasing the block size and convinced them is a great idea and some of them even told you that you should get on it already.
I am not surprised you guys managed to convince them, after all you are Gavin and Mike, the two most public bitcoin related developers, videos, conferences, foundation, chief scientists, media, etc.
I guess you didn't speak to me, but don't worry, i've been following plenty.


I am not sure it's going to work, i think it will cause lots of damage.
I think miners will be able to signal their preference, yes, but they can also fake their preference and things are going to get very ugly.

Still much better than requiring a consensus less hard fork, with all the risks associated.
You can't have your cake and eat it too, you know?


It would be OPT-IN wouldn't it? If there's a need for it it will be adopted, if not, then maybe people don't want it afterall.


I would agree that it is not a problem that needs solving right now.
As I stated elsewhere, wallet developers better hurry in handling full block situations while decentralization compatible scaling solutions are being developed. 


I disagree, and besides, it's much more irresponsible to do a hard fork without consensus.

this is currently the only solution available and it's opt-in, user choice, not part of the consensus or social contract.

Not everyone cares about Bitcoin and more importantly not everyone has the background it takes, most people don't realize the risks involved, nobody told them and the noise on the max block size subject is so high is probably distracting most developers.
The real problem though is failing to get consensus and taking this to the media without the necessary background information and education on the many subjects Bitcoin touches.

Many companies and wealthy individual can start using bitcoin regardless of the block size.
It should be as easy as possible to run a node, not more difficult otherwise only some can verify.


There is no way around it, the limit may be 800k, 1 MB or 20MB but as far as I understand nobody thinks we could have unbounded block and even if 20MB you will still have full blocks (albeit much more centralized) and so you have to handle full blocks anyway.

@_date: 2015-06-12 13:46:34

if you just want to disable the transactions without removing all the relevant code the smallest change may be [this]( but I am not sure it works (it may indeed crash).
It appears removing the functionality is a bit of work and the above patch doesn't prevent the app from contacting the multibit servers and unless you are interested in carefully testing and releasing signed software I suggest you pay the fee or use another wallet. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:46:27
I thought it was obvious but to clarify: consensus means 100% or nearly so, and obviously in that case 49% of mining power can't pull off an attack like one against a mere 75% of which the 49% is faking support leaving 26% of real miners easting their mining power

Disagreeing with BitcoinXT is not attacking the network, forking it without consensus on the other hand is attacking the network.


I guess we have to agree to disagree here, I don't consider RBF miners as miners attacking the network, it's in their incentives and unconfirmed transaction have never been considered secure. Unless you meant something else?

block size increases come with more centralization so we should be pushing only when needed as needed not more than needed and only as much as made possible by technological improvements.
We can't make a 2000% increase and hope that is enough to push the problem down the road, when in fact the process of increasing the block size is in itself a very risky thing to do, especially when done without any consensus by the people that have made this change possible in first place and in a competing fork.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:32:11
If I understand correctly it would stop at 32MB but it probably would break much earlier.
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:18:16




Saying that 1MB is already below the limit the network can handle is different from saying that blocks should be as small as they can be forged.


Not really, just suggesting that if people that supposedly care about bitcoin are ready to destroy it then why would you think a miner would never risk doing it, especially if it makes the richer short term?
The block should be increased when the network can handle it, not only when people think we are running out of capacity (which we aren't yet!).
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:10:25
I don't think people should lie about Bitcoin capabilities; bigger blocks are not a healthy thing even if you wish to ignore the data, the simulations, the actual tests run by Yufo and all the rest of it.
anyone claiming that increasing the block size *doesn't* put pressure on centralization is ignorant at best and malicious at worse, up to you to decide which.
we can increase it once more changes support it (see the improvements in 0.11 if you don't believe me, those should make 1MB blocks sustainable)

That's because you only want to hear what this particular parameter (block size) should be or shouldn't be incremented to, but they have proposed other solutions (like optional large block or dynamic block size strategy) or specifically have suggested improvements on both Gavin's BIP and Jeff's.
The other developers first worked and continue to work on improving the bitcoin core performance and decentralization and find out optimal block size based on these important factors, while Gavin has been very much relaxed and optimistic with his analysis and pretty much no testing in the real world.

You could argue the opposite, Satoshi intended Bitcoin to be decentralized not to be some Paypal or Visa but even so, it doesn't really matter what Satoshi believed years and years ago, what matters is today's consensus.


I think it's quite ignorant to believe blockstream prefers smaller blocks when everything they are working on would benefit from larger block sizes. They prefer larger blocks, as long as it doesn't destroy bitcoin and its social contract.
Gavin has not been involved in the changes that would one day allow to increase the block size so why should we bother to listen to the guy that has not contributed to bitcoin core in over a year?
Threatening to do a hard fork without consensus is reckless.

And not only that, if the big blocks are done by EU or USA it seems that china would suffer more orphans not the EU or USA, so this may reduce competition and increase centralization.

It makes it easy to resend a transaction when it gets stuck for too low fee, which will be increasingly possible as the block gets fuller
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:01:18


I think people disagree that having blocks full is a problem in first place, as [Mike Hearn]( said, even he is only speculating as to what would happen based on his centralized experience - others believe that bitcoin will work fine even if blocks are full, afterall you just need to pay higher fees to get through.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:50:34


that would have happened regardless of stress test, there are limits with transaction size regardless of the wallet used.
I think these tests are not useful, they increase the UTXO set and spam the blockchain. most of what people learned could have been learned by looking at the code.

GreenAddress solves the zero conf security in the same way a micropayment channel or Ligthening Network does, by making sure there's a trusted party involved that doesn't allow double spends by simply not signing transactions.
I am claiming that as long as there are miners that adopt RBF (and they are) then you can't trust zero conf transaction with confidence that they won't be double spent unless you know they can't double spend because you hold one key, or because a party you trust has one key and its entire business model is based on non violating the trust given (which if violated can be easily proven).
Monitoring propagation or checking that the fee is ok is a terrible false sense of security.
For better or for worse, if zero conf was secure we wouldn't need a block once every avg 10 minutes, we could well enough with a block twice a day.
 &gt; That's exactly what they're doing. The same pattern occurs over and over again. It starts with [+1] getting a bug up his ass and then his gang of merry Blockstreamers rush to his aid. They're exceptional at playing the victim and making it appear as if they're being persecuted and not actually trying to railroad every single discussion to suit them (and please don't bother responding to this by welcoming me to reddit followed by a wall of condescending text ultimately culminating in you being painted the victim and me somehow being ignorant on the issue....already caught that show.)
nullc or blockstreamers are not the only ones that think alike on this issue, there's me and there's Peter Todd and many others.


Thank you, I don't think I ever read that. It's a long thread but I read most of it. I don't think I disagree with the concept that bitcoin.org shouldn't have any particular strong political affiliation. And I think aantonop was being aggressive and unreasonable.


Nothing in that quote seems to suggest that a single group is positioning itself as sole custodian, I think it is a very generic statement of which I think we all should feel part of, we shouldn't let anyone destroy bitcoin.


Now I understand where you come from and I have to disagree, again, the people that contributed the most to bitcoin aren't the ones you claim to be attempting to maintain that vigilance, are the guys you are claiming to be part of the entrenched cabal.
But even it it this wasn't so, I would still think that we had bigger blocks we would have a much more insecure network which I don't want to have.
If anything we should be weary of the ones that tried to add black listing to bitcoin or the ones that suggest that we should hard fork bitcoin into a new github fork without consensus while still holding on to the bitcoin chief scientist hat (which is now more then ever meaningless given the foundation has failed on multiple levels),

What Peter provided is a set of patches (not even binaries) that gives miner choice they always had if only they bothered doing something similar (and some may have for all we know)
Zero conf was never really secure, just like satoshidice using the transaction id and zero conf was never secure even if it lasted a lil' while

Actually LN works even with 1MB block size, it just can't scale on its own to global without bigger block sizes.
In contract, if we had 8MB blocks today (where we avg 400kb blocks) we'd have more than 16 times current capacity and a 800% increase, further delaying the need for Lightening and its adoption.

That's wrong, given there is no consensus and if the crisis is real you'd expect consensus to be there. I think we are very far from this crisis.


Possibly in 2013 200k was a good max block size to have had but given the 1MB cap people knew attackers could only do some much damage. 
Going with a 2000% increase is far from a reasonable jump.

Hey Bruce, since you're here I thought I'd ask you a question or two:

What is Bitcoin without consensus?
If Gavin or Mike can't get agreement via the BIP consensus process and has to force this, even assuming he has a chance of succeeding, what would be left of Bitcoin if it can be undermined by one man when the people that contributed the most to bitcoin core have stated numerous times that Bitcoin can't handle his proposal?
There are two problems. 
One is that Gavin's proposal, even with 100% consensus, would lead to centralization and destroy all the value bitcoin had, it's decentralization and the security provided.
The second problem is that they are pushing for a contentious and consensusless hard fork take over, which could destroy Bitcoin even if it fails.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:37:01
See, this is not just something you can measure on one box.
This is about a relatively complicated network of nodes that need to communicate newly found blocks as quickly as possible and where few seconds make a difference in how many orphans you get.
We can't risk going to far off as it is hard to go from less decentralized to more decentralized

[Here]( you talk about Bitcoin and compare to some Google service as if it's anything alike.
Also [here]( at 7:25 you argue that you have worked for google map and earth, and how you dealt with capacity increase there (centralized) and you make the argument that we are running out of capacity (which I don't think we are).
 You also seem to suggest that other people don't want capacity to increase EVER, which is not true, people want an increase as soon as viable, we are disagreeing on viability and consequences.
You are also accusing the super majority of core devs to not want bitcoin to grow, which doesn't seem true either.
I just believe the consequences of reaching full block are greatly exaggerated by you (and Gavin).
I also find it very ugly that you have been lobbying private businesses on the side and are side stepping consensus.

Too bad this is not completely true, a lot of it is CDN and most connections are asynchronous.

There are both options, First Seen Safe RBF and Full RBF, miners are free to pick the one they like best because transaction inclusion policy is not part of the consensus

Yet for some reasonable time the node count has decreased.
It is not the only metric but it is one metric to measure decentralization and with a block increase these businesses are not more likely to add more nodes, on the contrary as is businesses are starting to move off a nodeless model and rely on other companies nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:04:20
Actually sidechains and lightening network (things Blockstream is working on) would  both benefit from a larger block size and Peter Todd doesn't work for Blockstream.
In my view we should be more worried about the side of the argument that wishes to increase block size and with it centralization not the one that worries about keeping the system decentralized. 
As i said elsewhere what attracts me of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized and permissionless, not the quantity of transactions a second;
To increase transaction per second I would first concentrate on Lightening network and other things like micropayment channel hub and spoke before touching the block size as it's hard to go back once you lose some decentralization.
@_date: 2015-06-19 11:16:10

I'm genuinely curious, how would that work?
If you use something like self signed certs then MITM becomes trivial and I rather have plain text instead, no false sense of security.
If instead you mean we should use SSL certs from the various authorities that sounds like it would force all nodes operators to buy certs that can be both revoked and MITMed by any certificate authority and in general would make the network further centralized.
Looking forward to hear your thoughts!

While I was in Amsterdam at the conference I spoke to some hardware manufacturers - it's actually possible that a manufacturer manages to make a hardware chip which contains a private key which can't be extracted cheaply even with uncapping. 
There are some techniques apparently that make the cost go in the millions per key extracted (i.e. per successful chip) but take this with a pinch of salt as I am not an expert by any mean in hardware manufacturing and I may have misinterpreted or have been told half truths.
The key in the chip could then be used to provide instant confirmation,  assuming the merchant trusts the hardware manufacturer and has a way to verify the instant confirmation (either by knowing the master public of the hardware manufacturer or by some payment protocol extension)
Hope I haven't over simplified :)

Do a BIP, if enough people agree with you there will be consensus. If not, then your opinion is not shared.


Just because I don't agree with your proposal doesn't mean I want to decrease the block size, nobody made a BIP about decreasing the block size, have they?


The argument is quite simple, there is no consensus and a hard fork without consensus would be terrible for Bitcoin.
The reasons there is no consensus is because the network is not homogeneous and large blocks will negatively impact many miners with weaker connectivity.
There should be pressure on fees if Bitcoin is ever to be sustainable as the block reward halves.

GreenAddress doesn't have access to your private keys and even if it disappears you don't lose access to your bitcoins!
Check out multisig and nlocktime.
From 
Multi-signature to protect against theft
Bitcoin includes a multi-signature feature that allows a transaction to require the signature of more than one private key to be spent. It is currently only usable for technical users but a greater availability for this feature can be expected in the future. Multi-signature can, for example, allow an organization to give access to its treasury to its members while only allowing a withdrawal if 3 of 5 members sign the transaction. It can also allow future online wallets to share a multi-signature address with their users, so that a thief would need to compromise both your computer and the online wallet servers in order to steal your funds.
nLockTime is a parameter that can be attached to a transaction, that mandates a minimal time (specified in either unix time or block height), that before this time, the transaction cannot be accepted into a block.
Hope this helps!

I think by instant confirmation they mean double spend prevention, I am not sure you can do that with 2of3 as others have said.
Not sure if BitGo supports the BIP70 payment protocol yet but if you don't it's an improvement over the current payment URI and on top of those improvements there's some development over an extension that allows instant confirmation.
See the proposal here 
Reddit discussion: 
GreenAddress supports it and the functionality has been in production for a while, of course let us know if you are interested in supporting the functionality (and if you stop with your patent nonsense)

to be fair the bitcoin.org group is against any contentious hard fork, that be XT, Core or any other repo fork with builtin contentious hard fork.
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:43:57
We are actually about to change a bit the instant part so that it becomes an optional feature of the payment protocol.
The way it works anyway is that because we have one of the keys and because we make sure that fees are correct and outputs have 6 confirms and everything is fine we will prevent you from double spending and as such your recipients are virtually guaranteed to receive the funds.
Keep in mind that should we ever miss on our promise by colluding with someone this will be instantly detectable on the blockchain and mempool.
It's a bit more than a hosted wallet because even if we were nuked tomorrow you'd still be able to recover your funds within a period of your choice.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:41:56
Yep, and it works great (as long as you back up in a few places)
Cold wallets have their use but it's extremely hard for some new Bitcoin users to do the above, hardware wallets will solve that issue on a day to day basis.

Are you saying Gavin should not be part of core and just move to XT altcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:40:40
different implementations of the consensus part is actually quite dangerous, i.e. accidental fork.
 there's some ongoing work to make the consensus part an independent library so that people can write different nodes without using Core.

@_date: 2014-05-01 17:44:23
Why? 
You can send funds to people via any channel, it doesn't matter if it's email in clear text, facebook, twitter or reddit.
Keys are generated from your BIP0032 wallet with hardened derivation and encrypted using BIP0038 which makes it safe to send them as third parties in the middle can't intercept them.
In terms of social login, it is useful to have various kind of watch only access which allow you to quickly check your balance or receive a payment without risking with your full on authentication.
I think Bitcoin users are rightly skeptic, but there are really good reasons to make it easy to send money to anyone regardless of how you met them.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:15:14
Apologies, let's try to explain it better.
For transactions that you make which require instant confirmation we require that the bitcoin that you are sending have been previously confirmed  in 6 blocks.
If you do not require instant confirmation then you can spend your coins without waiting that long after deposit.
Of course once they are all in your deposit it's all transparent to you.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:01:54
correct sir! that's a point worth stressing about imho.
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:21:16
I don't think it is a good idea to reuse addresses and this service incentives reuse.
Stealth addresses via master public could work or if you are already trusting a third party to act a multisig oracle then you can try something like this [page]( which never gives you the same address and all address belong to the same user. 
Addresses are never reused (although the user can if they want to and do so explicitly)
Used by a number of site, one of them: [ZealDoc](
@_date: 2014-05-01 21:40:37
Perhaps there will be system in place that will do all that is necessary behind the scene so you don't have to worry about these details.
The point is that currently it is best to not reuse addresses, there are risk associated, however small. 
The future issue of quantum computers may not be an issue as by then we may be able to find new crypto that can't be broken and migrate to that fast enough.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:57:24
No, Adam proposal is a solution to Gavin's argument without risking a  hard fork without consensus.
I don't think many love the idea of opt-in blocks, they are not super simple, but they are much better and _safer_ than Gavin's proposal, that's for sure.

2 of 3 means setups where users keep the two keys are very dangerous for non expert as far too often and inevitably people will keep them together and get hacked by malware.
And if the user is an expert those schemes are quite handy as long as open source and with super high security.
Our designs prevents malware from taking your funds via your two keys  and enforces true 2FA per transaction.
We shall update our FAQ to be more clear, can't agree more on that one.

Is it asic resistant like litecoin was first GPU resistant and then asic resistant?
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:38:46
Offering per transaction 2FA is only marginally better than just at login time?
The difference is that a virus can steal your keys and wipe your wallet with the latter but not with the former, especially as our sms or email 2FA msg contains transaction information.
What about never reusing addresses?  is privacy a marginal thing too now?
What about us not holding your keys encrypted on our service with weak javascript rounds and weak user password?
Maybe we are marginally better but I like to think about GreenAddress as quite an improvement :)

If you are using [Android]( and have setup two factor authentication properly, [GreenAddress]( is currently the only open source, deterministic and  multisignature wallet on android. The wallet works well on iOS too but as a webapp unfortunately.

Good catch, "supports_instant" as per [bitcoin development mailing list reply from Andreas]( is redundant.
About your second point, [Peter Todd has demonistrated]( that double spend can occur well in the 5 minutes after the first transaction his the network, making such monitoring mechanism vulnerable and a false sense of security. 
EDIT: I actually got confused, you were not talking about "supports_instant" but about "instant_signature".
This is the signature of the third party, like GreenAddress or Coinbase. The purpose is that those services that trust these two third parties could benefit from instant confirmation.

I think you can actually use some systems that allow you to build the app for free and installing it by providing your uuid.
If the user is interested in running open source software on iOS is certainly possibly however is not as easy as on Android and iOS users seems to not be as interested in open source as users of other platforms.
A different question may be is there any advantage in being open source on iOS? Interesting question :)

Out of channel, this information is not available by default to avoid general tracking of GreenAddress user and the related privacy issues.
Only the merchant or the ATM or exchange or debit card without preloading will receive the instant confirmation and act upon it but they won't know anything more than the user is effectively a GreenAddress user.
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:13:39
It's in [FAQ](
Or direct link [here](
There are limits to what we can show to users and be secure and user-friendly and not scare them away at the same time, it's a matter of finding these limits, for example:
Should we also say that chrome auto-updates and that Ubuntu or Windows or Android may auto-update?
What about C++ runtime, python, java/jre, etc?
What about Intel microcode updates?
Should we only suggest to use an FPGA built under your own supervision?
We are working on a local Java app based on bitcoinj, that should be the best compromise between security and easy of use and should work on both desktop and Android.

TL;DR:  a way to separate your funds logically and avoid mixing them (per account coin control) without having to have many separate wallets.
As usual, feedback is highly appreciated.
Current situation:
- all accounts are 2of2 with usual time lock expiry
- all accounts share the same 2FA and limits and nlocktime
- on iOS you can't change an account name for now but you can change it on all other platforms, next release will support editing on of account names iOS
- you will be able to pick n of m per account
- you will be able to have per account 2FA and limits etc

The firmware on stage should work on both [production]( and [testnet](
The issue above mentioned by slush0 was a misunderstanding about the signup/login steps but there was an issue on testnet which is now resolved.
For testnet it works via the plugin on firefox/safari/chrome &lt; 35
For prod it works like the above as well as with our [Chrome app]( 
Quick howto:
- Use already initialized Trezor with a new GreenAddress login:
Go to sign up, in the right corner of the mnemonic passphrase there's a button to use the seed from the device instead.
Add some 2FA like google authenticator, login with Trezor and use Trezor to authorize transactions.
- Use new Trezor with new GreenAddress login:
Go to sign up, click on write to hardware wallet, continue sign up with 2FA and then as above, login with Trezor and use Trezor to authorize transactions
- Use already setup GreenAddress account with new or old Trezor
Go to settings, click on write to hardware wallet. This will override the Trezor if not new.
Note: Support for PIN and passphrase only if setup from *mytrezor.com
Note: If you have transaction on the initialized seed presetup with GreenAddress (i.e. with mytrezor or electrum), those won't be visible or taken into account.
EDIT2: clarified

A number of third party services are going to take advantage of the instant transaction.
We're also considering premium intra user services that may require a fee, etc
There are actually a few other models too. At this time our only concern is offer a better alternative to securing user funds (especially inexperienced ones) and offer to the user a featureful product with plenty of services (of which some premium).

What version of the Android app are you using?
This was fixed in the last two releases, 0.0.28 and 0.0.29
The PIN option can be improved to have 4 or more digits.
Digits sounds better because they can be typed faster on a mobile and our solution is reasonable secure as even with 4 digits you have 10000 possibilities and only 3 chances to guess the PIN right.
Thoughts on the above?

[if you wait for bitcoin media you may have to wait forever](
If you don't like the service for a reason, great, if it's because of me, that's fine too but it sounds like you are looking at fingers when people are pointing them to the moon. If you have ideas about promoting the service that don't require huge amounts of cash i'm happy to hear you out!
Sounds like you don't care about the service but since it can improve security for a large number of inexperienced user i wouldn't discard it so quickly.

The reason you can take your funds if we disappear is that you get the nlocktime transaction from us half signed (our side).
Whenever you feel like (although you can't propagate them until nLockTime expires) you can add your side of the signature with the tool [Gentle]( by typing your mnemonics and free the funds.
We don't have a transaction like this half signed from you and the open source client can be checked that it never does nor sends the mnemonics to the server, not even encrypted.
If it had any use, in theory it could be implemented on a nLockTime longer than the users such that a user disappearing forever doesn't take the bitcoin with them and after a long time (in which there would be a buffer where the user alone can take them) GreenAddress could after both nLockTime expiry free the funds.
We do not have planned to implement such a feature but it could be useful for people that have gone through some hypotetical full registration with documents and proof and wants a last chance to recover the funds (even if they lost mnemonics and nLockTime transactions), assuming they'd trust us to help out in such cases (keep in mind that we wouldn't be able to touch them until both nLockTime expiry).

Some things you can do to improve your security:
- Login only in watch only when possible (Custom login) so that your side of the key is not even available in first place.
- Keep the 2FA on a different device from the one you access the service, so that software can't intercept it (robot call seems an improvement in that regard)
- Only use the open source non minified and inspectable local client (ideally from github as the chrome app autoupdates) 
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:56:08
Can you imagine a bank offering you a multisig and deterministic wallet that allows you to be the only one in control?
Jokes aside, you may be interested in the implementation: it  uses BIP0038 for encryption, so that you provide a password out of channel and no one in the middle including social network or telecom company can steal the funds in transit and it uses BIP0032 private derivation meaning that your recipient can redeem in any wallet their "tip" and you can pull it back until then should they never redeem it.

Hi! 
GreenAddress founder here :D


There is a risk of double spending: it's all about shifting the trust, you don't have to trust the user won't do double spending anymore, you move the trust to the third party, so us and not the user. 
Keep in mind that if we ever cheat it is immediately detectable in mempool and we are done, no more GreenAddress.
We are also looking/considering to have some "bond" for damages in BTC deposited in escrow with trusted members of the community, as a safe guard, just in case, we do not intend to disappear any time soon ;)


We don't think it is enough to have 2FA for login. It just isn't.
It should be per transaction.
For example,  malware can steal your bc.i keys after login and spend as much as they like.
Can you argue with that ? Is it not improved security having two factor per transaction as opposed to login ?
Cryptocorp looks nice but where is the source code of their client? I couldn't find it.
We don't think 2 of 3 is very good for the average user as they will inevitably leave the 2 users keys together and malware will inevitably find them and steal the coins.
It means that they really really can't enforce two factor.
We release the [source code]( of our [client](
We think this is fundamental and you should demand this for all wallet services, after all it is *your* money.


Reusing addresses is not a good thing. You lose your privacy.
We like choice.
I'm not convinced in bc.i you can add addresses without having to back up and besides, it is not the default.
We want good defaults for old and new Bitcoin users.
It's not a big change to add a field to notify someone via email or sms when sending a payment, you know, so that they know it's coming from you, so we'll look into implementing this.
Thanks for the criticisms and feedback.
Is there something we can do to make the wallet more of your liking ?
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:24:15
Thank you for the answer. 
That's fair enough, it's an interesting approach and I hope it works well.
Yes I also hate ads and I think they could be a security/privacy issue too, which reminds me, I was wondering if the BRIT mechanism can be itself a vulnerability/attack surface (I have not reviewed it in detail yet, still trying to understand it). 
Do you think it is not possible for you to [also?] monetize on high quality support and paid for features (either for everyone or as private plugins)?
Maybe there is no much market for it yet but it could grow very quickly.

We do know python but we also feel that at the moment, since we already [opensourced]( the client we should concentrate on more security and features but we would still love to support and sponsor an electrum plugin.
We may get around to it ourselves if nobody is interested once we finish some more important things.

While I agree with you I don't think it is fair to say that you want bitcoin simpler than email. 
Email has different security connotations from money.
Sending money to a bank account, especially internationally, has always required long strings of numbers. Even credit cards are exactly that, long strings of numbers.
The payment protocol should in part resolve the issue as it would avoid putting emphasis on the address and would push people to check they are sending bitcoins to the right site.
For person to person I'm not sure the payment protocol is ideal. qrcode is messy but still better than copying by hand.
At [GreenAddress]( we added long time ago the ability to send funds to facebook friends, email contacts and reddit users (only on for now), or even make voucher/paper wallet, all [bip38] encrypted.
IMHO the important thing is to work on something that is interoperable between wallets _and_ platforms (i'm looking at you Waggle).
One thing we've been considering is transmitting addresses via mic/speaker sound (NFC is obviously better for this but no iOS support). 
Other options involve using low range bluetooth which is available on all latest platforms.
Bitcoin Wallet for Android and forks at this time are the most feature full wallet in this sense.

I think they don't allow you.
Yes, this mean they can get hacked or worse, run away with all the bitcoins you store in what they call 'pocket money'.
The way [we]( implemented it is such that funds are always in the user hand and when sent to a recipient without a wallet yet they are  encrypted with [BIP38]( This means we can't we or facebook can't steal the funds which is how it should work I think.

The really good reason is that with a 2of3 mechanism during account creation you have 2 keys in memory at the same time or alternatively in a not user friendly two device operation: both sufficient and necessary keys can be easily stolen then long before you deposit funds.
The second part is that the large majority of inexperienced users won't keep the two keys separately and therefore will be subject to malware targeting them.
Last but not least with 2of3 you can't guarantee the user won't do double spends while with 2of2 you can allowing for interesting opportunities.

I am not sure, they may be using the same mechanism we use with a server stored password retrieved by PIN? 
Are you talking about the double private key protection? Perhaps they use a similar mechanism but instead of storing inside local storage they store inside the user password encrypted wallet kept at blockchain.info server.
I am not too sure on how bc.i works but the above would be better than some weak brute forcible solution.
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:43:02
If you had trouble with the PIN during login or registration it is indeed a bug we have fixed and are currently testing.  Apologies!
There's a workaround for now: do not set the PIN during login or registration and then set it in settings later.

Good question.
Founder of GreenAddress so take what I say with a pinch of salt :)
 I think both can reach reasonable security, the question is which one is more likely to be more secure on its defaults and for the average Joe.
I think that 2of2, where the 2 keys are never on the same device is better than 2of3 where the user is most likely to have 2 of his keys in the same device at least at first (and in fact, even long term given they may not be security conscious)
Yes, you can create 2of3 with one of the keys being on a separate device but it's not a user friendly procedure (which I guess is why they kept the option in an advance view)
Other than that I know that transactions from GreenAddress can't be correlated on the blockchain by design, while with BitGo you can do correlation after funds get spent (unless they updated their platform).
Last but not least, GreenAddress has 2 full open source GUI clients for windows/mac/linux and for android (and soon iOS), I can't find a GUI client on BitGo's github repo. 
I forgot to say, our open source clients also do extra blockchain validation against the electrum network to verify that GreenAddress' servers are not providing bad  blockchain data (say after they get hacked)
edit: added electrum verification mention
@_date: 2014-09-12 21:47:31
[GreenAddress]( has a deterministic wallet with a per 'sub'/parallel account coin control.
You still don't reuse addresses but each address belongs to a specific accounts of you wallet and you can review separately transaction, receive new payments or send from.
There should be a blog post with screenshots coming soon on this :)

Our mnemonics uses the same standard but given we offer a multisig solution the mnemonics are service specific and while with the api you could pick your own mnemonic phrase we don't have the option via our own UI.
With bip32 the wallet structure can vary a lot. One such structure is bip44 which is relatively recent (newer than GreenAddress) and probably not ideal for multisig (for GreenAddress at least)
Thanks for the support, hope this is ELI5 enough ;)

The picture displays a bitcoin hardware wallet (or a prototype thereof).
This bitcoin wallet can be 'married' to another remote wallet in multisignature so that for each transaction you also have to authorize with two factor authentication.
The hardware wallet makes sure that no software on your computer can get access to the private key that holds the bitcoin.
So this is the marriage of two software and hardware technologies and we're starting to see the first results :)
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:42:10


I did say you have an advanced option to generate the key on a separate device, is that incorrect?




2of3 is good for that. 
The nlocktime as you may imagine become invalid as you spend funds and the ones expiring soonest can be used when spending and you don't have to wait until expiration before the funds move, in fact the system can automate that with auto nlocktime re-locking - which is something we are investigating. Thanks for pointing that out!
Some questions:
- Any plan for Android or iOS?
- 2of3 costs more in transactions fees doesn't it?
- How secure are the encrypted user wallets kept on BitGo servers against brute force attacks given the wallets are encrypted in JS with user passwords? Or is that not correct?
edit: removed first question, answered elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:05:27
With GreenAddress you don't have to trust the HW1 as each transaction has to be authorized separately (multisignature)
I think they are already working on something open source with PRISMicide however I don't think you can get any open source hardware at the cost of the HW1.

We can't manipulate the app if you install it and verify the code or have others verify it for you.

Hi, Lawrence from GreenAddress.
You could use PIN login or alternatively you can also login via NFC or a qrcode, both even encrypted with bip38.
24 words makes your 256bit seed. 
12 words makes 128bit seeds and is the minimum considered ok.
You can't really go below that.
While 12 should be secure enough we preferred to use 24 and be consistent with it.
 Most people can't memorize either and while manual input and login can be done I think most automated solutions like PIN or qrcode and NFC, possibly encrypted with bip38 make a much smoother experience.
p.s. We are working on finishing support for Hardware wallets too which should be the safest option and eventually should work on Android too.
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:19:37
You could sign an unspendable p2sh transaction with embedded somehow (OP_RETURN?) a digest of the message you are signing.
Does that sound like a start of how it could work?
In a way it would be a pretty standard way of making a signature, and validating it would also be relatively easy but there's an argument for overhead I guess?

True but it works differently.
A hacker gaining access to blockchain can brute force easy passwords on the encrypted private keys. 
Not possible on GreenAddress, we don't store your private keys.
unlike blockchain the 2fa in greenaddress really protects your funds and never reuse addresses, by default.
It's easier for malware to steal your bitcoin with blockchain.info than greenaddress.
@_date: 2014-06-20 13:45:45
You can check the nlocktime with Gentle and verify that it points to outputs that you can spend once the nlocktime expires. Is all provable and can be done independently of our service.
The address used is from your BIP32 seed and is different for each nlocktime transaction for privacy reasons but if there's enough interest I don't see why we couldn't allow you to set your own address, although if it's just one it would have privacy consequences so it may be preferable to use a master public.

Hi, I do get notifications for replies to me and i lurk quite often :)
You are right, our user interface doesn't have an option to set your own seed although you wouldn't be able to use the two sets from electrum as the checksum would not match.
A patch to our UX or direct use of our API would allow you to pick any seed then encoded into mnemonics but in general since bip39 encodes some error correction you can't pick the full result without some effort, effectively discouraging brain wallets.
The status of multisig is that as usual all our addresses  are multisignatures 2of2 and that support for 2of3 and other n of m is coming soon :)

We tried on Chrome and not Firefox but we are on it. EDIT: Fixed :)
We can't fallback to cookies for everything because if we were to use a cookie for the PIN functionality your encrypted mnemonic then will get sent to the server (because cookies are) and we would find ourselves with both the encrypted mnemonics and the password to them, thus access to your Bitcoins and clearly not right.

@_date: 2014-06-03 09:40:14
Correct, if the user sets a PIN a random device Id is generated as well as a 256bit random AES key/password which is used to encrypt the mnemonics to store on localstorage.
The random key/password is then sent to the server together with PIN and device ID so you can later retrieve it by PIN + deviceID to decrypt the local storage mnemonics.
The key/password is only useful to the device that has the encrypted mnemonics and the PIN associated AES key is deleted after 3 wrong guesses.

We offer two different client side only, unminified and open source wallet clients. One is for Desktop and one for Mobile (and currently supports Android but could support more soon in the future): these clients don't suffer from XSS or any remote execution.
However depending on how you install them or configure them they may suffer from silently auto updating.
What you say for the web client is true but it remains quite convenient for watch only access or for small change.
The time locked transaction are such that in the eventuality that we don't provide our side of the signature you can still take the funds as per your settings (minimum 1 day, no maximum, 90 days default)
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:40:01
The fact that the funds are in multisig and the open source client doesn't send the user key to the server.

For some reason my reply got lost, maybe some network glitch while I was replying.
The exchange only needs your funds in his hand for instant order and book order purposes, as long as you transfer the funds from your wallet to the exchange only then it means you are already at less risk than you are today and you can still add instant orders or order books instantly (as the exchange can trust there won't be a double spend).
Yes, the exchange has to trust the third party, and the user doesn't have to trust just the exchange.
There may be more interesting/deep types of integration too, we are still working on this.

We received this request a number of times and in the future, should an alt become more widely accepted we'd be happy to include it in our offering but at this time all our efforts are spent on bitcoin alone.
@_date: 2014-04-17 22:48:21






We need to implement multisig and a local standalone client for localbitcoin so it doesn't matter if they get hacked, hackers would also have to hack you to take funds yet localbitcoin  can still guarantee you won't double spend them.
If they don't want to deal with all that perhaps they could use a [third party](
@_date: 2014-12-28 14:08:22
Wait, the 2of3 is two with the user and one with GreenAddress.
One is the trezor, and the other one is another set of mnemonics: via API it can be any xpub but in the UI we still need to add support for both hardware wallets and xpubs but it should come soonish (next few weeks hopefully).
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2014-08-21 01:08:56


That's entirely true. In the future I would like to offer multisig with blind signatures or anyhow leave no space for the server to know anything about the user or his transactions.


All the available choices are different versions of broken.
It's a fair point of view. I think soon there will be more HD wallets and with that there will be more mobile wallets that are fully decentralized and that meet your needs.
Anyhow, I'm glad you realized we can't do more "mass surveillance platform" than say Mycelium or the others.
Also: we allow TOR connections, so there's that going for us if you want to be using the service in privacy.
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:12:19
it's not exactly super user friendly and you don't want to scare off people just because they don't get "code and inject" and we are more honest than other online wallets.
i'm trying to find a good trade-off.
Maybe a link to some external web security article, maybe on ars which describes things decently but i could not find much.
I found :
and this Ars article which could be an example of XSS vulnerability  
Maybe I need to write one article about it and post it on the [blog](
On a side note, did you read the [post about not reusing addresses]( What do you think about it?

We are still looking for early feedback but here at [GreenAddress.it]( we are working on something that you may like.
Our Wallet uses 2 of 2 P2SH multisig and provides nLockTime transaction.
These transactions can be downloaded manually and are automatically emailed to you.
Should we *ever* **disappear**, these nlocktime transactions will help you recover the funds with a tool we've built, see  [Gentle]( .
The tool is already open source, check it out! 
We also have an Android [app]( which supports qrcode, native crypto and NFC login (working on the NFC transactions as we are speaking).
When we have gathered more feedback and finished some of the currently in progress functionality we are going to open source both our Android and web client (perhaps with a Chrome Extension).
Some of the features of our wallet:
- Hierarchical Deterministic  [BIP0032]( like [Electrum]( (although we use a different branch of the key)
- External payment url with a freshly generated bitcoin address off your public master key 
- Two factor: Goole Authenticator, Email and SMS - and you can choose which one at transaction time.
- Social integration: It's easy to tip on Facebook and Reddit (more coming)
- Social login: you can login with social accounts to see your balance and transaction. This uses your public master key so your funds are never at risk.
- Last login time and IP
- CSV export of address book and transactions
- No regular backups, like Electrum, just backup your mnemonics *once*.
- Quick PIN login (encrypts your mnemonics with 256 bit AES random password. Encrypted mnemonics is stored on local storage and password is kept server side and deleted after three wrong PIN attempts)
- QrCode login
- NFC Login
- Email notifications
- [Instant]( confirmation
And much, much more coming:
- Limits
- Delays
- Payment protocol
- Android PUSH for transaction notification
- Sms notifications
- NFC payments
- More tipping and watch only login  (twitter, google, etc)
- Colored Coins
Hope I didn't miss anything :)
If you want to give it a go, try our Testnet/UAT environment [here]( , in [FAQ]( more details on the faucet.

You do realise that if you accept BitPay or coinbase and the tx gets not confirmed or double spent the merchant is the one that takes the hit?  Just like with credit cards fraud. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:52:22
Hi, Lawrence from GreenAddress here
You should only get "Re-deposited" when you send bitcoins to yourself (to an address of yours).
If you want, you can let us know the txhash privately and we can look into it.
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:50:02
Sounds a lot like [GreenAddress]( we are working on improving insight too!
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:36:03
We already started talk for integration in coinjoin as bigger pools offer more transaction traffic and therefore more privacy but we also look forward other options (and if you have any suggestion we are all ears!)
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:50:26
Multisig wallets 2of2, with one of the keys handled by GreenAddress can make sure you can't double spend, hence if you 'merchant' decide to trust GreenAddress you can accept transactions from GreenAddress users instantly.
See this [post]( on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.
The idea is to support the feature as an open protocol for anyone interested to support.
edit: grammar
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:47:16
which is what the warning is all about.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:10:09
Perhaps I wasn't too clear but with the changes coming soon:
not all transactions would be greenaddressed, just the ones that required/requested it and it wouldn't be on the blockchain but out of band, meaning that privacy is kept safe unless explicitly requested and only to one party which you are transacting with anyway.
We are removing it the social from the Chrome app, it shouldn't have been there once we removed it from the Login page, you are right.

Would you say it offers better privacy than GreenAddress?
Can you explain how? I'm truly interested, I'm keen on continually improving the platform :)
edit: looks like you are not replying to the important and juicy questions. You are the most private just like you were the first multisig wallet and there's [enough proof]( on the blockchain for that :) 
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:11:15
Have a look at [GreenAddress It](
Its design is quite unique and its security is the top aspect.
Open source, multsig, HD and it double checks the server is not being evil by verifying data against the electrum network.
True per transaction two factor, no matter what (unlike all 2 of 3 wallets)
We disappear ? No problem there's [Gentle]( also open source.
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:42:26
GreenAddress can't do that unless the user wants that and even then GreenAddress prevents double spends :)
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:04:16
Why do you say that with notifications it would not have happened? 
Peter has demonstrated double spends 5 minutes apart and if you are willing to wait for 5 minutes you may as well wait for a new block/confirmation.
We worked on GreenAddress' double spend detection and it can't be perfect because miners may hide transactions.
A false sense of security in my mind is worse than the alternative, especially if its DDOS prone.

got it! top man!
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:23:12


We have not added this feature because we don't hold your private keys.


We can't offer it.  We absolutely do not want to store any funds on our systems as they could be subject to an attack.
What we can offer is some client side functionality to sweep that private key funds into your GA.it wallet, and that's coming soon but it would be equivalent of you loading your  private key and sending the funds manually to your account.


@_date: 2014-05-01 22:33:20
As far as we know we have not been hacked since we started but if you want to feel safer you should create a new wallet on android or chrome app and then move your funds.
The point is that if you use the web site anytime the site gets hacked (which has not happened yet but may happen) you risk, with the android or chrome app even if the server gets hacked it can't do you any harm because your client verifies transactions both against the server and the electrum network.
Hope this helps and clarifies!
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:48:26
Sorry to hear you had a bad experience.
We are working on making it faster by slowly but surely moving to an entirely native platform.
By the way, would you mind telling which Android version and mobile device? It would help us with testing and improving the app.
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:21:20
No, I only have one Green and it's mine. My precious.
Also, you should not buy hardware wallets second hand or off ebay and such.
Joking aside, no, this green one was a present from Satoshilabs and obviously this may change in the future but currently there are no plans to ship our own version although Satoshilabs is obviously free to ship green Trezors (we don't know if they plan to, I think they were more on Pink last time I spoke to them). 
@_date: 2014-04-14 10:24:46
No, the company is in Malta (mostly because when we opened up regulation in UK wasn't clear with VAT) and the team is spread in EU.
We have greenaddress.com, greenaddress.es and a few others.
the .it is a 'domain hack' 
A bit like bitcoin.it i think :)
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:45:06
It's all on blockchain and the clients are all open source  see 
there's a printed wallet backup both during registration and in settings and on Android you can further save it on a NFC tag.
There is no offline and coinjoin is not implemented yet, correct.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:11:06
2FA is per transaction.
And in order to remove it you need 2FA.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:52:50


Actually when you download the Chrome App you can extract the HTML, JS and CSS inside and it is all unminified so you can _really_ look.
You can also build the one from the GitHub repo and only upgrade if the diff is verified by competent people, we are working on something to get some third parties reviews of our open source client (as well as overall design).


It's redundant if GreenAddress.it is never taken over, the day it is, and I want to prepare if it will, the server could have told you lots of lies and the client would have blindely signed transactions away the first time you pay someone.
 This way, the electrum network, the client can verify independently that it all sounds good and that one of the keys of the 2 of 2 belongs to GreenAddress.it (but only the user will be able to, the world won't see these users are using GreenAddress.it by marely looking at the transactions on the blockchain so there won't be reduced privacy.)
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:53:01
And I admire your good intentions, we have good intentions too :)
IMHO we should advocate for the generic concept of multisig and make sure users know of the big compromises in terms of malware or hackers with respectively bc.i and say coinbase, not so much because these are bad parties but because the design allows for issues which we worked on preventing entirely :)

Washington, DC — The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) will hold a public meeting on October 9, 2014 at CFTC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C.
CFTC Commissioner Mark P. Wetjen is the sponsor of this Advisory Committee.
The meeting will focus on issues related to clearing Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDFs) and the digital currency bitcoin. The meeting will consist of two panels. The first panel will discuss whether a clearing mandate is appropriate for NDFs, with a particular focus on how such a mandate would impact foreign exchange contracts. The second panel will discuss CFTC’s jurisdiction with respect to derivatives contracts that reference the digital currency bitcoin.
The meeting is open to the public with seating on a first-come, first-served basis. Members of the public may also listen to the meeting via conference call using a domestic toll-free telephone or international toll or toll-free number to connect to a live, listen-only audio feed. A video recording of the meeting will be made available on the  approximately 48-hours after the meeting.

hello sir!
You may be happy to hear that we have submitted the app to the f-droid repo:
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:38:11
You can take our chromium app from github and install it enabling the development mode. 
During onboarding usually there's client side key generation and some marrying process for multisig, there's no reason you couldn't modify it to generate the keys offline and then do the marry without private keys on that device but it is not something we support out of the box unless you either modify our client or use directly our APIs 
@_date: 2014-12-28 14:42:21
Eventually the aim was to have good defaults but allow for subwallet specific limits and 2fa and various combinations of 2fa (as you suggested) for bigger amounts either via subwallets and/or via global settings. 
The sky is the limit really but indeed more settings options can complicate the user experience to the point of crippling features and only have people already expert in bitcoin use or even notice the features, even the ones we almost consider basic.
For now, we want to make the UI as easy to use as possible while maintaining top privacy and security and while we are getting closer I don't think we are there (nor the industry yet).
As we get closer to wider usage and acceptance, standards, etc more advanced features will be available. Anyhow, noted your request :)
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:14:18
I don't think for iOS they can unless they build it themselves and run it via their iOS development account.
For Android you can build the app straight from GitHub and run it on your Android device without the development account.
We intend to submit the app to F-Droid too and other stores.
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:04:55
Hi, this is happening because of a known bug.
Basically it only happens if you switch app during a transaction (i.e. to read 2FA).
The bug is our fault, that being said we really suggest that users should not use the same device for two factor authentication.
A work around while we fix the bug for this is reading the 2fa off the notification bar or off another device.
Hope it helps while we fix the bug, but really, don't use 2fa from the same device, it is certainly much less secure. We understand it's very hard to have two device for this purpose however we do hope that things with hardware wallet devices will improve.

I'm not suggesting brain wallets, we do not implement them and although users could use our 'raw' api and do it we do not recommend it.

We can simplify the setup process and we are currently working on moving the 2FA as first thing after the mnemonics (as we think it's more important).
All steps can be skipped, allowing you to have your wallet in 2-3 clicks but we it's all a compromise between security and easy of use.
Do you have any specific suggestion as to how to make it less complicated?

i'd say many differences, blockchain.info is the older and more established but other than unlike greenaddress:
- it keeps your private keys on their servers (encrypted with user passwords)
- it is not deterministic (worst, they reuse addresses)
- it is not multisignature
- misses a bunch of features that greenaddress has (although to their merit they offer coinjoin/sharedcoin which we have not integrated yet).

Assuming the MITM can't reuse the same session key on both sides.
If a device does a MITM that device will have access to both session keys and will just relay data in a decrypt/rencrypt pipe, perhaps modified as needed to fool the device, correct?

This is not about hiding from the government, it's just about generic privacy and improved security.
Some bugs in some bitcoin implementations can be taken advantage of only after you spend as that's when in order to spend funds you reveal your public key.
In general it has always been recommended to not reuse addresses, nothing new in that sense.

I hear what you say, on the other hand, the alternative for the users is to use a web wallet which is far from ideal compared to a local app. Not everyone can buy a new phone or move to Android.
There's certainly effort involved which could be wasted if Apple rejects the app, however luckily we didn't have to port too much code to get it work decently and the extra work is worth the effort anyway as it improves our abstraction layer :)
So worth trying IMHO.

@_date: 2014-12-27 22:48:44
It took me a while to understand where the 30 second comes from, then I realized you meant Gooogle Two factor authentication only lasts about 30 seconds (GreenAddress supports 4 different kinds of 2FA). It is also kind of late!
It is already the case that the user signs first and then GreenAddress signs the other side.
While it would make sense to first sign and then ask for 2FA currently that's not the case and one difference with this is that if you choose email or SMS or phonecall 2fa you get to review the details in the 2FA message before signing which for non trezor cases has some benefits.
Perhaps for hardware wallets we can add a settings option to first sign and then do 2FA. Feedback is helping!
@_date: 2014-12-28 11:54:32
Yes you will need to transfer funds to take advantage of multisig.
Please note that GreenAddress does not currently advice to share the same seed with say mytrezor/etc as GreenAddress wouldn't handle mytrezor transactions and presumably vice versa but otherwise it should just work.
This is not a hard limit, can be changed but in so far GreenAddress was designed to be exclusively multisignature and Mytrezor is currently single signature.
@_date: 2014-04-26 10:16:09
We did not post the openings on our site just yet but [GreenAddress]( is hiring, interns welcome :)

This is a step in the right direction






It's very simple: can i use the service using local open source software?
If not, the service shouldn't be trusted.


We did it, because we think it's a must: both to give back to the community but more importantly to provide a truly secure platform.




True,  the 2of3 will have to handle this for inexperienced user (and inevitably get blamed for it too! even if it can be proved that the two keys were the ones from the user)
We choose 2of2 because it doesn't have this issue and it offers much, much more.
@_date: 2014-09-20 10:55:20

I used to use blockchain.info
Then I decided I couldn't stand my encrypted key being on their server as it can be cracked offline.
Most users will most likely use a terrible encryption password too.
Furthermore I don't like that the two factor is only necessary to login, not to send transactions, making it quite useless to keylogging and malware looking in memory for the key.
Furthermore I wasn't really happy with having to backup my wallet all the time or alternatively the idea of having to reuse the same address over and over destroying my privacy.
Which is why I left my software engineer/tech lead job and founded [GreenAddress.it](
A deterministic multisig hybrid wallet, some find similarities with Electrum because of the mnemonic passphrase but given our multisig/two factor it is quite different.
Early feedback and features request is very appreciate!!
We also have an android [app]( and we are looking to open source the client or build an electrum plugin.

A transaction with timelock does not get included until the timelock expires.
Our service requires minimum timelock of 1 day, default 90 but user configurable.

I am not sure I understand:
The issue is with bitWallet or with GreenAddress?
When did you create your bitaddress card? Can you decrypt it fine in other ways?
It seems like a coincidence but I just helped someone yesterday recover funds from a BIP38 wallet created under [these]( circumstances (JIT bug in webkit on Safari 6.05)
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:14:42
Greenaddress.it does it with a local static client (chrome app, open source) and it further checks the validity of our (untrusted) server data against an electrum server, for extra safety.
Can you find any issue with the approach?
Oh, and the wallet is deterministic bip0032 ;) via mnemonics.
@_date: 2014-06-16 17:32:27
on iOS ? 
I don't know too much, I know coinpocket and blockchain.info but the latter is not available anymore. There's another one where you have to join a coop and then you can download the app as a business enabled account.
If you jailbreak the situation is different but I have not looked into that.
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:47:52
We have not look into this yet in any level of detail but we'll certainly do once we look into implementing coinjoin.

Looking in the network for double spends just doesn't work as it only solves some scenarios, not all by any means. A true false sense of security.

Have you seen [GreenAddress](
It's an open source bitcoin multisig deterministic and bip0032 wallet.
We are implementing both what you call 'married' and 'parent-child' and what we call enterprise solutions w/ auditing, it would be good to collaborate on things.
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:11:29
Whatever I say I will forget someone as well as have missed completely someone that deserve it more.

yeah but when this is not the core service it becomes a negligible cost. Free for the user and no advertising.
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:19:37
It is good for that yes and if you find it easier than 2fa with a paper where we ask for random codes on it the why not ;) 
One issue either way is that you don't get to check transaction details from a second "trusted" channel such as SMS or email 2FA which prevent a class of MITM attacks.

GreenAddress has a sane address reuse policy, it is HD and it is multisig.
It is available for Android, iOS, mac, linux, windows and as a web app.
And it is open source LGPL in GitHub.
discaimer: i'm the founder of GreenAddress
edit: added supported platforms
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:18:17
It should be possible to do an Electrum via GreenAddress.it client via plugin.
Our client implementation is fully in JS, which could still be integrated I guess  but it would't really  make sense as electrum is written in python and can already do anything (I believe) that our client does.
Given that we already have an open source client an Electrum plugin is not in the top priority on our side but we would definitely support it and I would love to sponsor it too since it shouldn't actually be too difficult.
If anyone is up for it, get in touch with me!

Point taken, we shall make this more clear.




We will look into the issue asap.




Point taken, we shall make this more clear.




You did say that we offer nothing more than blockchain.info and I just showed that we do, we offer REAL two factor authentication per transaction as opposed to blockchain.info where once you are logged in malware can have a party.




It's coming.

similar to micropayment channels, [GreenAddress]( can offer instant confirmation on payments to merchant that choose to trust a third party (that doesn't control the funds and can be detected immediately if conspiring with a user)

Yeah the point is that even if you have your hardware wallet stolen or lost they wouldn't have your two factor and with your mnemonic backup you can safely move the BTC away at first occasion :)
@_date: 2014-05-01 21:30:17
deterministic wallets allow you to back up one thing and to not reuse addresses.
Yeah, there is no standard to pass around these addresses other than stealth addresses but hey bitcoin is still young.
If you are saying that reusing addresses is not the problem well try to tell that to users that got hacked with the android rng problem or the next guys hacked because the ECDSA implementation was not perfect.
Paranoid? maybe, ask the core developers if you want to be sure but with bitcoin i rather be paranoid than not and then sorry.
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:16:27
Not sure I get the question.
For the user we keep enough to generate new public addresses even when the user is offline.
If the question is about watch only addresses we don't support that yet but we could support it soonish.

1. Uhm, who pays for double spend, the processor or the merchant? did you read the Terms and Conditions?
2. There wasn't much fraud in credit cards for a long long time either. Things in the bitcoin world evolve fast and this may be a bigger problem in the future, when you can double spend with an app
3. Monitoring for double spends is a false sense of security and even then is not instant, still takes many seconds, too long for certain activities.
4. instant isn't the only service GreenAddress will offer, we are finalizing an enterprise offering for API and multisig, deterministic shared accounts with audits etc but we think instant is great :)
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:10:26
The other difference is about privacy as I understand the same key is reused over and over and over per BitGo account

Is apple that different from Google? I mean darkwallet supports Google's chrome and in general there's a lot of foss code on both osx and iOS or android etc
I personally prefer Linux but IMHO it is not bad to write multiplatform code. Nobody should feel obliged but I like the idea of using my own hardware as I please and ATM can get together to pay some devs to change it.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:04:45
Feel free to ask any question or have any suggestion as to how to improve the security. 
We have followed best practice and more (reduced exposed services to minimum, two factor access, key only ssh iptables to certain ips when enabled from aws manually after authentication etc).
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:07:04
You should see the transaction immediately.
If you don't, I hope you are not using an old version of coinpunk as it suffered from a bug that made erroneous transactions with P2SH addresses  (i.e. starting with 3)
Let me know privately the txhash if you want me to have a look.
About the address book, yes, we are adding scan for address.
You can also add email addresses to send in it.
GreenAddress doesn't store any key, not your HD wallet nor just keys (but obviously we hold the other side of the multisig).
Currently you can sweep WIF keys (or bip38) and it will send the entire amount to your wallet but in the future we'll enable to choose where to send the funds (but we still won't store your private keys, at least for now, we may create an encrypted mechanism for this in the future)

you can reuse address for now and complain to your friend to use a more modern wallet or provide you in advance a list of addresses or you can say screw the risks and reuse addresses. 
As long as you know the risk before doing it.
Eventually some standard will take over.
EDIT: added some info
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:16:21
That's correct, we use P2SH addresses in multisig of two different HD sets (ours and yours).

We use BIP0038 to secure a  freshly generated prime/hardened private key off your BIP0032 wallet on which we store the amount when you tip/donate via facebook/email. 
The BIP0038 password is then sent out of band (face to face, phone call, sms, etc).
This means that nobody should be able to intercept the money, including facebook, someone sniffing your emails or us.
All done client side (today we should release the static Chrome ext for early feedback and it should be on github early next week.)
Note that this also means that until your recipient redeems the tip/donation you can take it back.
On reddit we disabled BIP0038 on tips as you are unlikely to have an out of band channel with your recipient of the tip and sending it separately to the same reddit account doesn't really provide any more security.

@_date: 2014-03-23 23:29:17
It could be an option but we need to carefully avoid to alienate users so I think it should be always available and defaulted when perhaps a good source of entropy can't be found.
At the moment we use the same as the most reviewed web wallet, bc.i, so first window.crypto.getRandomValues if supported
and some repeated Math.random if getRandomValues is not supported.
We could use instead something similar to bitaddress.org in case window.crypto.getRandomValues is not available.
How does it sound?

no because they don't have your device, they need the device.
If they have the device:
no because they wouldn't have your two factor authentication device which is necessary to spend.
As soon as they try to spend them you would get notified and they wouldn't be able to get GreenAddress to sign the transaction.
At most, if you enabled limits, they can spend up to the limit without 2FA but that's by design for small amounts (think coffee amounts) to avoid the friction of 2FA.

Not sure, GreenAddress does but I would advice waiting for the next release for some UX improvements (coming in the next few days in theory) - it also supports separate accounts you can create to manage your funds and never mix (coin control per account).
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:58:44


Nothing like that.


It surely seems like a good enough reason to avoid something ;D


Not really, no more than blockchain.info, coinbase, bitgo, icevault, eliptic, mycelium, etc
All these use a centralized service to transmit your transactions.


You can argue all you want that we have "Green" in the name and I can only agree with you. We got that. 
On the other hand, we don't monitor transactions more than any of the service i mentioned above, including mycelium which you happily suggest.
I'm happy to answer any question you may have but let's not mislead users in thinking that _other_ services are less centralized.
In fact, our wallet automatically checks against the electrum servers network that the greenaddress server is not providing evil data and due to this we have one of the best rating on bitcoin.org.
I hope you can overcome the color issues! ;)
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:57:10
It's something we are considering yes but the improvement is not as good as people would have imagined/hoped.

You are the first one to hit this issue and it was tested multiple times (including just now).
It works for me and many other users. 
- Are you using Google 2FA App or some third party?
- Any issue with time on your device ?
Your device needs to have time synched reasonably: could that be the issue? 
Just to confirm: would you agree that we offer more security than bc.i or do you still think otherwise?  
Perhaps it wasn't immediately obvious that malware can steal all your bc.i funds as soon as you login.

Great feedback, you find me/us in agreement and eager to apply it!

You should use two factor for that, multisig is perfect for this purpose.
@_date: 2014-06-15 11:35:41
My view is that you bring some valid points. 
The community should be more clear on 'instant' transaction vs confirmation.
As others have said, Bitcoin is not perfect nor it competes with perfect. It's a different system with lots of great properties but instant is not one of them, decentralized transactions require either time or third party trust.
Bitcoin is a cheaper banking solution which may not seem great for first world country at first sight but that brings instant access to the world economy to third world countries - and that's huge.
For the rest there are people working on building - on top of bitcoin - the tools that can help provide *some of many* solutions ranging from instant or purchase disagreement (escrow), oracle data providers and so on and so forth.

Is it not prone to:
- Sybil attack
- Malware on the phone doing a MITM by using an exploit (there's always one) or taking advantage of users jail breaking
I think it is - granted, iOS is an environment with higher security than your generic outdated Android but I don't think you can say that Breadwallet doesn't suffer from generic MITM, if people find ways to do jailbreaking it means that apps can do MITM, and that's excluding a sybil attack.

The other side of the signature comes offline from your mnemonics using the tool Gentle, you then push the transaction and the funds get unlocked.

Hi - hijacking the comment with highest "_?_" ;)
The app is still buggy, as I commented in reply to various people we apologize for the issues, especially with PIN.
The good news is that we fixed most bugs and you can try the latest via this [link](
Via the link above you will also be able to receive updated version of the app before they get to the Apple iOS store which takes more time.
Add your device now even if you want to try the update later!
Assuming nothing new gets discovered we should expect an update on the Apple store within a week.
edit: thank you for putting up with this! appreciated!

There is authentication - if you watch closely on the Trezor it asks if you want to sign a message for GA.it to login, at which point GA validates the ecdsa signature against the Trezor xpub!
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:45:21
It doesn't work exactly the same.
It's interface is similar, but the coins are actually from your wallet and not deposited in some place not in your control.
It also instead send you a link with an embedded private key in WIF format, so you can choose to redeem/sweep in your own separate wallet or login/create a new one on the service. 
We are still looking for early feedback to improve the service, apologises if we have been too aggressive in seeking it, we'll try to restrain ourselves if so!
@_date: 2014-03-15 02:46:10
if you mean your mnemonics then I'm afraid the same thing that happens with any other wallet - you lose your funds forever.
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:04:07
I agree, while maybe keeping some hidden advanced features, we should simplify by default and only show the minimum necessary, especially for iOS but I think this is a good generic concept and you wouldn't want to have a too different experience in different platforms in general so it may make sense to apply it to Android too (and Windows Mobile I guess!)
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:22:10
Is the app not open source or not on github? I can't find the code. 
I think we found something faster for bip38 and you may be interested ;)
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:27:09


It's not yet fully trustless but generally within 10 minutes you can be safe and we are already working on the fix, it's pending on [this]( 


That's actually not true if you use the version from github (you can download it as a zip too), it doesn't autoupdate.
And it's trivial to not auto update on Android (which anyway i think it's the default?).


We admit there is a window, but it's quite small. Compare to wallets that hold the keys entirely or wallets that as soon as you login allow malware to steal your coins GreenAddress shows better advantages.


Look at the code yourself, get someone to look at it for you, or convince the developers to get trusted members of the community to sign off on their code.
We did not have devs sign off the code but we did have quite a few people from the bitcoin dev team review the design as published on our [blog](
Gauth is not good because it doesn't give you transaction information like email or sms does but on the other hand it is more anonymous and can be done with an offline device.
 [our profiles are public](  and hardware wallets will also mean we can't actually change the code on the client even if we want :)
@_date: 2014-06-14 13:30:45
Hello :) author of the proposal here, if you have any question or comment feel free to ask!
Users that trust [GreenAddress]( can check the instant confirmation inside their wallet (on a UI 'badge' similar to the N confirmations or unconfirmed).
While some platforms are interested in the instant confirmation some will take longer or won't.
For this reason and for external wallet users you can still manually check if a specific transaction is instant via  provided that you are the recipient of the transaction and can prove it - and of course that you trust GreenAddress to not allow users to double spend.
The external instant confirmation link does not work for multisig or P2SH external addresses yet.
edit: grammar, small correction.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:12:07
Yeah  uses it such that if the service disappears you can unlock your funds independently.
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:55:52




Not true by default: the user is actually  pushed to download the app (android or chrome) which has local code ONLY and it's all open source on github and can be run from both the market and github (just like darkwallet alpha!) 


That's fair enough, by all means, our service is tailored for the majority of uses cases but I can understand your choice of in house solution when this is a viable option but not all users can do that and we offer one of the more secure solutions out there I believe.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:30:01

@_date: 2014-05-02 11:34:19
The client does some verification but there are still a few things we would like to add to improve the security and we still need to handle malleability as per the design document/'white paper' proposals you can find [here]( 
These are technical improvements and it's all open source for people to verify. 
If I understand correctly what you actually want is not a technical improvement alone but also a way to verify that what we say is true.
This is an issue that can be partially addressed by independent and signed review of our github releases from people or an organization you trust.
The design of the system (although not the implementation details) have been reviewed by a number of people including core developers.
There have been suggestion as to both offering bounties for reviews, integrating plugins in popular open source bitcoin wallets such as electrum and last even do a  hacking contest.
Do you have an opinion as to what would leave you with enough confidence the service is true to its offerings?
Last but not least, do you have a way to ultimately verify that all software, including libraries, operating systems and CPU and GPU microcode is free from bugs or malicious code? I'm not trying to avoid the issue, I'm just suggesting that it goes much deeper than GreenAddress and that it would be nice to have a system with an incentive to review and to run good code only.

It uses local storage to encrypt your transaction data locally for snappiness but it should work without, albeit slower but there are other 'recent' browser features required anyway so I'm not sure this would work for you.
It also uses webworkers, web sockets and in the web served version appcache.
It's [open source]( and pull requests are very welcome.

I wasn't talking about your service, as the two factor is more per login.
I was talking about wallets that hold your keys, like coinbase or exchanges like bitstamp.
 I call them Blackbox wallet, you don't really know for sure if the funds are there (although I hear something is changing with a new exchange using a new idea and Bitstamp has been very upfront with the community)

I actually briefly investigated that and it appears to be nothing more than a 'save to desktop' thing.
They are attempting to create a store for 'web apps' but you can already easily run 'web apps'.
Basically unless I misunderstood something you don't have any more native access than you already do today with an html5 app running on iOS safari.
Last, their keys could get revoked just like any other app.
Did I get anything wrong?

eh, not sure i misunderstood :)
malleability of the funding tx can mean that the nlocktime we gave you in advance is not valid, so there is almost no point in giving it to you in advance until we can make sure the funding tx is not malleatable, thing which we can only do for tx we sign ourselves anyway so i am not sure it can be fixed with third parties given they will always be able to malleate transactions.
Unless I missed something.

We will update the BIP draft with a diagram but to answer your question the 2of2 is first done by the user and then by GreenAddress in exchange of some user 2FA.
GreenAddress can then sign the tx details with x509 and provide it to the merchant as otherwise they'd have no idea it was done using a GreenAddress wallet as all addresses are used once and third party can't find users addresses even with GreenAddress master public.


I think a set of geo nodes are going to be a waste if I can do the double spend 5 minutes after the original tx which is what Peter has demonstrated.

There's a huge difference with greenaddress.it kind of greenaddress and coinbase, although both allow in principle greenaddress/instant confirmation.
Coinbase kind of greenaddress is exactly like mtgox's. It's not a good model.
With coinbase they could disappear with your funds or get hacked, with greenaddress.it that's far less likely as you are in a multisignature wallet and you control one of the two keys.
Even if greenaddress.it disappears you can wait a bit (configurable) and unlock your funds independently.
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:16:50


Both are 2 of 2 Multi Sig. 
GreenAddress supports both 2of2 and 2of3.


GreenAddress can't freeze user funds by design, see our [FAQ]( under "But what happens if your service goes away? Will I lose my coins?"


GreenAddress by default encourages users to use apps (we have apps for a variety of Desktop and Mobile and hardware wallets) and those are not subject to the injection of javascript. The websites pushes the user to the app automatically and informs them that the web page is not as secure as the apps.


GreenAddress has 4 different kinds of 2FA each with pros and cons some of which can't be bypassed in the way you described. Remember also that bypassing 2FA is futile if you don't also have the user mnemonics or hardware wallet.


So does GreenAddress. At no point in time the keys are in the same device.
Discalimer: I'm the founder of GA
EDIT: GreenAddress does login via an ecdsa deterministic signature similar to bitID but based on a random key of the BIP32 wallet and has done that since day one.
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:42:19
It was answered in another [comment]( hope it clarifies
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:36:16
If you want 'safer' then you want per-transaction two factor authentication and you may want to try  [GreenAddress](
Comes with [Windows/Mac/Linux]( [Android]( [iOS]( _and_ [Web app]( support.
Of course, [open source](
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:50:39
Uh, forgot [GreenAddress.it](
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:58:00
The minimum is 1 day.
To test it enable nlocktime set to 1 day (with email notifications and 2fa enabled) and then just wait either spend some funds or send some new funds to the wallet to get the new nlocktime transaction.
You can then wait the 1 day and test it on gentle with your mnemonics.
You can get the time locked transactions both in email or from the transactions details.
You can also try in our [testnet environment]( in that environment the minimum is 0  but with you'd have to hand modify gentle as it currently supports prod by default :(
Hope this helps :)
@_date: 2014-09-11 14:20:05

Coin control will be possible at some point with some degree of control but not sure yet how much (i.e. by address or by 'algorithm')
@_date: 2014-09-17 11:32:24
I think it could yes, users by default wouldn't trust any instant confirmation provider and can manually add the ones they trust.
There's already a plugin for electrum for this functionality :)

It's not about servers, it's all about customers
@_date: 2014-09-17 09:31:54
I think as of today GreenAddress is the only one using the payment protocol extensions but coinbase does something similar internally (thus not using an open protocol) and huobi recently bought quick wallet (2of2) where they also allow for instant deposits into huobi.
I'm not sure if quick wallet supports the unlocking of funds independent of the service like GreenAddress does but the idea is that even if GreenAddress was to disappear thanks to [Gentle](  which is an open source tool we developed hosted on github, you'll be able to recover your funds independently of GreenAddress.
The idea being that users should be skeptical of services and trust them as little as they have to, no more and only if they wish to of course.
edit: grammar
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:50:00


If you don't use the website (which is not necessary at all) you don't have this issue. Even with paper wallets its bad if you put them on imgur! :D
We can't realistically expect coinbase or blockchain.io web customers to necessarily use an app if they don't want to, but we'll certainly make sure they make an informed decision and remember that web could be used for small change or for watch only :)

[GreenAddress]( is a multisig deterministic wallet which doesn't and even can't operate in reserve mode as the service does not have access to your Bitcoin private keys (and unlike other services we don't hold your keys full stop, not even encrypted, as we believe that to be a security hole given users passwords are generally not known for good entropy)
The wallet is open source and available for almost all platforms
@_date: 2014-09-17 23:23:56
The Rock Trading started with using our API for its deterministic and multisignature properties and they accept the instant confirmation directly through that.
I believe eventually. they want to support the functionality via the payment protocol aka BIP70 with an extension  for instant confirmation ([announced in this reddit post]( so they can use a trust protocol between otherwise unrelated bitcoin operators :)
I imagine in the future they will be able to pick from a list of trusted providers. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 07:11:31
Actually not that hard to double spend, trivial to automate in an app.  I'm not saying you should wait for a confirmation for coffee but if you sell anything of value you may want to wait a few

It's not a matter of open sourcing or not, it's a matter that Apple can revoke the certificate to any of the apps.

@_date: 2014-08-21 02:16:46
Yes, I wasn't thinking limits or instant confirmations will be compatible with blind signatures but nonetheless I would like to support it (have you seen the work done by oleganza?) and who knows, maybe in the future there'll be enough advances to allow all sorts of features with blind signatures.

Hi depends on which wallet you want to use, what needs you have.
I'm biased as the founder of [GreenAddress]( but I'm proud to say GreenAddress is the first and currently the only [open source]( [multisignature]( (per transaction two factor authentication) and [deterministic]( wallet available via web client, [desktop]( and [android app]( 
Both [desktop]( and [android app]( app do extra security checks via the electrum network. 
[Quick intro video](
On top of new addresses and address book entries it allows you to send funds to email contacts, Facebook friends and redditors via our [gaittip bot]( even if they don't have a wallet and with all the safety of bip0038 encrypted funds (not on [reddit for reasons explained in our white paper](
It also allows you to login from anywhere with a readonly access mode which poses no risk to funds (no mnemonics no keys)
And [more]( :)
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:37:54
You can use the seed encrypted (BIP38 like scrypt) or you can use a hardware wallet that prevents the key from extracted however for best security GreenAddress implements two factor authentication via multisignature protecting your funds with two keys.
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:00:26
Probably not yet but they are working on BIP0032 but i don't know much more about their future plans.
Maybe a plugin for multibit hd could work as you described.
@_date: 2014-08-19 23:23:05
Hi, Lawrence from GreenAddress here.
There's some things like escrow and instant confirmation where you can't do away without a third party - at least currently.
In the case of instant confirmation it can't be done away without third parties because it takes time for the network to reach consensus.
The way we designed GreenAddress, which is one of the first of such trusted third parties is such that we never have the ability to take the funds or even to suddenly lock the funds as even if we disappeared you'd still have the ability to unlock your funds.
We're doing everything we can to make the solution as trustless as possible and to make sure to build this feature on top of an open protocol so that others can offer the service.
Until there's a solution that allows for instant confirmation without trusted third parties we think that instant confirmation via payment protocol is the best thing available for reducing risk.
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:30:25
If you think bitundo is anything like the brainwallet service you misunderstood the service. Afaik brainwallet doesn't easily allow double spends, it probably just helps with propagating transactions that are valid (i.e. not double spends).
This pool won't stay tiny if things work out as they work out in the real world.
Credit cards keep increasing their rewards to the users and fees on 
Merchants are forced to increase prices.
Users are incentivized  to not use cash and to move off lower reward cards to high reward cards.
The ones who don't use high reward cards receive less value, especially if using cash.
Overall merchant and users lose out, greedy credit card wins.
This article explains it better than I can 
 
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:32:23
That's not how it works.
You can't lose the mnemonic passphrase as without that you lose your funds but even if the mnemonic passphrase is compromised since GreenAddress is multisignature it is not enough to move the funds, you still need to provide a two factor authentication code to have the second signature applied.
@_date: 2014-03-16 15:12:12
Please do, info
The Android App is scheduled to have quite some rework done.
At this time is using appcache and loads the pages from the website and it doesn't do the independent client verification via the electrum network and it has not been open sourced yet.
We want to change it to open source and only run local code and do the independent client verification: it should also be snappier, at least on first load but in general we want to do some work to improve the snappiness too.

I've noticed you didn't collect it :  unclaimed; take funds back
You see that ? Basically if you had a GreenAddress wallet the funds would have been sent straight to you but because GreenAddress doesn't know you it has sent to you a link with an embedded WIF private key containing the tip.
That tip comes straight from my wallet and because it didn't go straight to your wallet, until you sweep it, I'm capable of pulling it back (just in case someone never collects your tip, just like the other tip bot).
So collect it before in 6 months time I'll just take it back!

[GreenAddress]( as a wallet supports it and you can use it on any site that supports the payment protocol like all BitPay enabled merchants and other payment processors I heard support it too in Germany but I don't know the name.

As bad as it may seems you can already do worse by using 0.8 and 0.9 fees to double spend as Peter Todd has shown.
And as more and more pools differentiate on what transactions they mine this will become an even bigger problem, especially as the block reward halves.
Is it not just a matter of time? Why then building infrastructure that relies on something we should not rely on?

@_date: 2014-07-29 22:27:17
You can recover the transaction in case the service stops to exist but you have to wait for your presigned transaction to have the time lock in them expire (nlocktime).
This gives the transactions enough time to get confirmed before they unlock and the system automatically avoids funds that are about to expire for instant confirmation transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:38:12
Yes it is an automated way of having multiple copies of the wallet.
It could lead to errors if implemented wrong but in my mind we are talking about such small files there's no point in replacing them or updating them, just copy on write, at least two copies with checksum, or three.
Anyway, as I said, the real solution is to use deterministic wallets.

BitGo does keep two keys on their infrastructure although one of the keys is encrypted with a user defined password in the browser via JS.
On average user defined passwords are not really hard to break and this is no better than what bc.i or others are doing.

Not sure which service you use but GreenAddress has always been multisig and HD and it never reuses addresses (in fact, the service is quite pedant about it)
The btchip is HD and while it does not have a screen it has a secure element which means that extracting keys from it is much much harder and more expensive than on non secure elements.
I like the trezor (and I can't wait for it to support multisig) and btchip but neither is perfect, both have things in which they are better and things that are worse.
@_date: 2014-06-15 22:34:28
The intention is there, we want things to be a bit more mature both on the features and our platform.
We just found out bc.i coinjoin is not secure recently and DarkWallet is still in development and not suggested for bitcoin net so while I think it is perfectly usable we may want to wait for some consolidation - same goes for stealth addresses and assets over the blockchain (some kind of colored coin? )

Each nLockTime transaction is valid as long as the specific output doesn't get spent, at which time a new nLockTime transaction is created with a default nLocktTIme value taken from settings.
So eventually if you make many transactions all your valid nLockTime transactions are going to be fresh (the invalid ones don't matter anymore and are worthless).
GreenAddress automatically emails you when these nLocktTime are about to expire so that you can "renew" them but we're looking to automate this too if the user prefers.
if I understand your question right, the counter is reset at each new transaction but it is only for a specific referenced output as your funds are not in one but N nLockTime transaction, one for each spendable output.
Does this clarify at all?

To be honest the stealth address 'specification' still needs a bit more reviewing and i'm not so sure it will be used much for donations (it is far more likely people just make a donation page that provides you with a new generated address and that perhaps uses the payment protocol too)

yes, it really depends on the market.
Some things are really not traded like that, some things are traded "seldomly" and far in between.
One hour delay (on avg) between how often you can trade the same output is not terrible for all markets but indeed it probably is just not good enough for some/majority.
This is assuming we talk about 6 confirms as necessary, but perhaps for this purpose 3-4 could be enough in the future (maybe?).
I was talking mostly about derivatives.

It's actually one of the addresses derived from your HD wallet, different for each nlocktime transaction for privacy.
The transaction is half signed, so that with your mnemonics you can sign the other half and use them once the nlocktime unlocks.

I can't answer to most questions, not because I don't want to but because some are issuer specific and some are card specific and while we are trying to standardize on the kind of cards we are going to offer via different issuers for either regulation or for compatibility with current platforms there's going to be different answers.
I'll try to answer some:
1) I don't think it will work differently from debit/credit card, minors will require some guardian authorization if possible at all.
2) Issuer dependent, regular card KYC AML mostly - although I am hoping in some places issuers are allowed to offer the cards under certain amounts without requiring documents so there is some hope there.
3) hard to say at this time it also depends a lot on how many people want one but i don't think is going to cost much if anything
4) I am not sure it will be RFID. Not discussed for now. Potentially we could do something like that without 2FA for micropayments but it has not been discussed as of yet. I'll keep it in mind.
5) The actual case is what happens if for some reason i send the btc but the card times out? I lost my btc?  The actual answer is that if you attempt again with the card it will pass and if you don't the issuer will refund back the transaction within an hour (minus network fee) - this is the plan so far, is not fixed in stone so take it with a pinch of salt.
6) You should be able to use the card in any country, yet, some issuer may apply limitations but maybe offer cheaper rates. So it depends.
7)  The idea is that yes you would and it would work like case (5)
8) can't say
9) the logic is not on the cards is on the issuer or bank and GreenAddress
10) Something like this is in the works regardless of card, it could work with the card too but don't expect this from day one (unless the issuer comes to your country later than other issuers in other countries) 
11) I believe those would be presigned transactions or authorized when the system books the transaction, i may be wrong though.
12) Probably not at first
13) BTC terminates at issuer or bank, not at GreenAddress
14) only for presigned this can work although there are ways to get data from the PoS system, and verify it against a remote trusted party via PKI
15) No special PINs the card is not particularly smart
16) Bank/Country specific surely
17) No problem in disabling it, deregistering with the third party bank is another matter and same goes for the card which is going to be their property
18) I do not think so
I am sorry I had to be very vague, but I managed to answer a bit :) 
@_date: 2014-07-20 12:13:25
No, if anything the proposed regulation is making start up wonder if they should completely block NY residents from using the service - assuming that is enough as it appears that if one of the recipients of a bitcoin transaction is a NY resident you are still breaking the rules.

@_date: 2014-03-15 22:34:02
At the moment we have not enabled externally our "greenaddressness" (although technically it is on).
The way Green Address is implemented is such that we won't sign if the fee is not right, the output has less than 6 confirmations and we won't sign the same output twice, hence making double spend not possible and therefore allow people to accepts instantly your transactions.
Now, the way we communicate this to external parties was initially to be done with a fixed key of GreenAddress.it in the P2SH, but for privacy reasons and to improve user experience we are changing this such that:
- Both your and our key in the P2SH is always a new one for each transaction, hence better for privacy.
- We will only provide the greenaddress signature via the payment protocol memo field matching a public key we have previously published.
Hope I have answered all your questions! :)

@_date: 2014-09-01 13:04:26


Actually that's not how it works, the user can pair an existing trezor without ever loading the seed outside of the trezor.
We count on adding a mode that allows to pair an old seed in greenaddress with a trezor but by default users should just create the seed as per usual without ever loading it on a computer.
However, the compatibility between Trezor and GreenAddress is not yet ready as multisig is not implemented yet in trezor.
(just came back from the Trezor party in Prague, full support should come soon)

I used bitpay a few days ago for a large amount and it got confirmed on the merchant side before the tx was included in a block,  about 30 seconds or less.

have an upvote :)
The seed is used to generate your side of the 2of2 - you can reuse addresses but we tend to avoid that generally.
Ideally you should setup two 2fa so that you can undo one of them in case you lose a device. I suggest Gauth because if you copy the code down is actually a good backup measure and it works offline and actually independent of Google services.
It's not great for usual 2fa because it does not contain transaction information, thus is more susceptible to man in the middle attacks by apps on your device that show you one thing but do another.
@_date: 2014-10-07 17:33:56
I'm still not sure I understand how it is different :)
I guess my question was: can anyone, even non recipients of the transaction, find out whether a transaction was coming from block.io if greedaddressed?
@_date: 2014-03-19 12:37:09
Great work!!
@_date: 2014-05-01 23:17:11
If the mnemonics are leaked but your 2FA is still good (because our keys have say not been leaked) the attackers still can't steal your funds.
They basically need to hack GreenAddress and you to get the funds.
EDIT: so we are going to change the password at every successful PIN and continue to delete after 3 wrong attempts.
@_date: 2014-12-28 11:02:16
Yes GreenAddress does not get the seed (not even encrypted), it does however get the xpub from your already initialized Trezor that allows you to reuse the seed you already have.

You are correct and you can add to your list also the idea of having VISA and Mastercard debit cards linked to instant confirmation wallets.

For [our wallet]( apps we use [Cordova]( which supports some [Windows targets]( we could relatively easily port the wallet to Windows Phone.
Would you be interested in a multisignature and deterministic wallet for Windows Phone? The web version should work (including qrcode) but obviously using a local app with local code is better and more secure.
If any developer here is interested  we're actively looking for people with Cordova/Windows/iOS experience, if it sounds like your thing PM me.
I've posted to [here](
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:35:34
hey, thanks for the endorsement but to clarify, GreenAddress does not import keys.
we only support sweeping them (move all funds) as we have a deterministic wallet and don't keep or receive your actual keys on our servers (not even if encrypted)
this is because we don't think it is very secure, especially if encrypted in JS using user non random passwords which sadly is exactly what some other bitcoin service providers do.
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:12:31
@_date: 2014-04-15 14:45:55
Yeah but for some reason I feel that's easier to hack than some separate thing but I guess if the encryption is good and there are no bugs in the OS or supervisor it can be as good.
But physical separate is still stronger is it not?
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:23:23
The idea is that double spend will only be prevented with instant transaction (which, btw, is not available on our system until we support the payment protocol).
For instant confirmation the system will check that the bitcoins you are about to send via instant confirmation are not about to have a  time locked transaction expiring soon
Please note that the system already notifies you in advance and proceeds during login to auto guide you into 'extending' the time locked transaction by moving the funds into a new P2SH.
Please also note that this is actually automatic as you spend as each change goes to a new P2SH and as such if you use the service enough you won't have to ever invalidate the locked transaction by moving funds.
Last but not least we're working on using locked time transaction to allow the system to further automate this process (more on this as we complete the development)
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:32:35
yeah, uhm, no.
it won't be a replacement nor full rewrite.
Unless you mean replacement/rewrite like linux 2.4 was replaced/rewritten by linux 2.6 and 3.0 etc

There are still no official instructions as this support is very recent but it should be completely guided and  I [posted]( some instructions about it recently 
Once you can login in your GreenAddress wallet on the desktop with your Trezor then you should be able to use your Trezor with GreenBits.

@_date: 2014-04-16 11:17:16
I don't think used twisted logic at all.
Fact: any of the major pools today could easily pull a double spend, at least often enough to make it worthwhile, it doesn't have to work each time.
There is negligible direct cost for them to pull this off, although it may affect bitcoin value and thus indirectly be a higher overall cost but this doesn't stop people from using credit cards with huge rewards and huge fees to merchants which cause overall less value for everyone but the credit cards (or in our case the miners) and the principle is the same.
Fact: miners have bigger and bigger investments in mining and their motive is mostly profit and they have the strongest incentive to move pool or coin depending on remuneration.
If this can be solved at the bitcoin protocol level great but if it can't it should be accounted for, it should be expected, it should be handled gracefully.
You really don't want to trust 0 confirmation based on miners playing along as them playing along may change at any time and handling this at a later time might be a massive pain in the ass for the bitcoin ecosystem and it may hurt it real bad, which is why I tend to agree with Peter and disagree with Mike.
Please note that there are ways using third parties to have 0 confirmation transactions (without giving the third party control of the funds).
It's based on trust/reputation, similarly to how escrow works with third party arbitrators.

The nLock time is user configurable, 1 day to "infinity", defaults to 90 days.
The thing is that as the user spends the nLockTime gets reset, making the funds constantly protected by the 2of2 (with 2of3 there's no nlocktime setup).
And when the nLocktime is about to expire you get emailed and as you login there's an automated procedure to simply relock them by transfering funds to a new p2sh address.
About bitID/ bitauth: we like it and we would like to support one or the other or maybe even both. There's some relatively minor pros and cons to each. So far it hasn't been a priority as generally support is weak and not many people have requested it. It shouldn't be a large change if the necessity comes up.

Yes, that's true, you should always use two different devices.
If you really have to use one device, perhaps enabling the robot call is useful as many mobiles don't allow apps intercepting the call and therefore can't do voice recognition on your 2FA.
To also improve our 2FA, we are working on adding where possible transaction information (amount, who) to the 2FA notification.


We offer a completely local and open source client as well as a watch-only mode, so you can still use the web just to check your balance or transactions and use a local client for more important things.
nLockTime transactions on their own are useless without your mnemonics and even then useless until expiry (which usually won't happen as you will renew the nLockTime before that, the wallet currently notifies you and in the future should be able to automate this process further)
We're adding other nLockTime backup options (currently Drive and Dropbox)


Actually that's changing such that you won't send the btc into the 2of2 until you have an nLockTime transaction back and we're working on integrating work to make transaction non malleable, see 


We are working on making that possible without ever trusting us for a single moment (using what I suggested in my previous answer)


Nor we think most people would be able to store them separately and offline, is not like they read the TOS so I imagine  these users should have access to a better, secure by default model given their lacking level of expertise (you shouldn't need to understand too much about btc to just use it).

No the problem is not that, the problem is that with trezor you can verify on screen the amounts before making the device sign the transactions with btchip you either need to use two computers or GreenAddress on a computer and a mobile to make sure you are not blindly signing transactions (some malware could swap values on the fly and display something different to you)

Even if we provide the nLockTime transaction in advance because of malleability the nLockTime transaction could reference some outputs of a transaction via txnID that may not get included with that txnID because of malleability.
This means that the fact that we provide the nLockTime in advance is just nice but not a 100% proof you have your funds secured yet as malleability could cause a transaction with a different txnID to be included so you will only be sure after enough confirmations (generally 6) and after a valid nLockTime transaction (we send you a new one should the txnID change).
Hope this clarifies!

Difference with and without BIP0032 in some scenario that affects you right now:
To use different addresses, you have to back up each time you generate a new one.
With: To use different addresses, you don't have to back up as they are all derived from one master address (seed).
In the case of GreenAddress.it your seed/master is your mnemonics and all your addresses are generated client side from it and you never need to back it up more than once as it doesn't change.
Now, why would you use different addresses?
- Privacy (people can't just easily and trivially follow you on the blockchain, you at least have reasonable deniability)
- Security (once you spend your public key becomes public, before then your public key is not public, just a hash of it, this could/will one day become an issue with quantum computing)
So services that only use one address should be avoided if you care about privacy and, at least eventually, security.
And services that require a new back up are just annoying since we got BIP0032.
Please note that with BIP0032 you can actually do much more than what I just described, like allowing someone that only knows your public key to generate new addresses for you or being able to audit all your corporation addresses by using one master and have sub trees for specific departments, etc
Hope it clarifies a bit!

in javascript there are no primitives to call mlock and make sure ram is not swapped (which can cause keys to be stored on disk in the clear), especially if your ram is not encrypted.
in javascript there are no primitives to zero the core limit such that in case of a crash memory is not dumped on disk.
To be fair, this is not a limitation of javascript only, most languages limited to garbage collecting usually don't have these primitives and make it hard to do (i.e. you need to use a native library)

I personally use GreenAddress for all my live wallet necessities. The reminder is in cold storage. I think GreenAddress is safer than your average non multisignature wallet because of malware.
hardware wallets are also good.
Yes, we have both an open source [Android app]( and an [Chrome App](
Both can be run from [GitHub]( or installed from the respective stores.
Both won't trust GreenAddress' servers and will double check transaction data against the electrum network before signing transactions.

There's various reason as to why someone would want to use Trezor in multisig.
a) They want even more security
b) They want to share the wallet with someone like a SO
c) They want to use GreenAddress' instant confirmation to cash out to an [atm]( quicker or to send funds to an [exchange without waiting for confirmations](
d) Because you want to use GreenAddress which is multisig only and you have a Trezor.

Once malleability is optionally removed this will be a great tool to avoid third parties and speed up transactions.
Until then you risk locking the funds with the tx referenced by the time locked tx not being included in a block because an equal but malleated tx was instead confirmed.
There are some risks if you can't trust the merchant.
This applies to users depositing on [GreenAddress]( too which is why we are keen on a solution and have submitted patches to this extent to [bitcoinjs]( and [pycoin]( ;) so we can reduce the trust window to virtually zero.

More than underestimating speed, the HTML5 wallet we provide on Cordova or Chrome is the web version open sourced and packaged so while it did require quite some work to get up and running with Cordova it allowed us to provide a more secure experience (both compared to other wallets or to our own web one) almost for free or very little work compared to a full re-write.
We're working in parallel to both improve the HTML5 one (to improve local cache across logins, currently cache is used after login only for the current session so if you resume the app from standby or from switching from another app you are throwing away cache which could be reused if updated, making switching page slow) as well as a native port using our own API which I am sure will be uber fast!

You can't login with facebook, not with any key loaded anyway.

Much better than risking your keys just to check on the go if you got a payment in (in case you don't have our email notification set up).
The question is, why would you want to tip other people on reddit/facebook/email/sms/twitter and there's a reason people do it or want to do it.

Simply because multisig wallets are much more secure?
In our particular case, our [chrome app]( is [open source]( and runs only local unminified inspectable code.
Furthermore, the client doesn't trust the server at all and performs all blockchain data validation independently via the [electrum network](
Our key is provided only when you provide your authorization via 2FA.
If anyone should compromise our services, including our system admins they can't take your funds (as there is only one side of the multisig) and should the service even disappear completely [you can still take your funds back]( as we provide a tool that unlocks your funds when you wish ( also [open source](
On any other local only wallet, malware can steal the keys from memory and as such multisig wallets are what is most needed for inexperienced people or in general people that don't want to have to deal with complicated and unfriendly security procedures.

If our servers goes down you only have to wait as much as *you* have set yourself (1day minimum) before you can spend them again.
For added safety, use the open source Chrome App: it does extensive blockchain data verification via the electrum network such that even if our server is fully compromised you are not going to sign away any of you coins.

We did remove the interface too, perhaps the Chrome App needs updating ?




I'm sorry I didn't realize you hit an issue we fixed yesterday, I updated my post to reflect this.


We don't yet recognize any greenaddress source: Once more 2of2 or otherwise secure greenaddress implementation come around we will recognize them.
In terms of third parties we are working with a number of people to integrate our service with exchanges, hardware wallets, and third party providing bitcoin related services to merchants .
We will update our site once we have these third parties on board, until then, it kinda is a chicken and egg problem :)
We are advertizing our capability and we offer our guarantee, it will take time for us to build a reputation and we understand that.


Can you expand on that ?
If we were to provide instant confirmation for all users at all time the users will have impractical 6 confirms waiting for all transactions (including change) and, depending on the implementation, they may lose on privacy.


We do these checks and we re-propagate the transaction should it go out of mempool.
Just because we are not established doesn't mean we will never be :D
As I said above we are working with a number of third parties, it's up to people to trust or not, just like you trust bc.i, we have done things that nobody has done before including client side independent verification and nLockTime.
 &gt; What it comes down to is that I'm very critical of bitcoin services. The service you're providing is misleading, and my shaky experiences so far have left me in doubt. All I see are "features!" with no utility to back them up. Like I said, the nlocktime thing is pretty cool, however it's a major inconvenience in comparison to the competition, blockchain.info, without providing any benefit.
That's wrong and IMHO now you are being misleading.
We provide per transaction 2FA, does bc.i do that ? I don't think they can.
How can you even compare ? Once you login malware can easily take all your money out, it's all in memory: with us that's only possible if they can also intercept your 2FA.




I think there might be some confusion. We offer an HD wallet transparently to the user, what exact features do you want?


Anything in particular given my answers above ? We do not want to mislead.


We have a lot of functionality in the pipeline.  At this time we feel it is safe to use the wallet and the feedback is really helping.


It sure is but 2FA only fails for some countries we have not onboarded yet and it just doesn't get enabled if you can't confirm it so it's more like not active rather than failed (as you have to confirm it to set it)
The withdraw funds issue was just limited to dust which is annoying nonetheless, however that's fixed.


Don't be sorry, we are quite grateful.

It's even more secure if you use the [Chrome App]( as opposed to the website as the Chrome app is [open source]( and comes unminified for easy ispection and only runs local code. 
And it checks that the server is not serving fake blockchain data or bad GreenAddress.it P2SH by double checking it against the electrum network and it's own copy of our HD public master key.
Don't forget to set your 2FA!!

How do you know it's unused? Just because the person you have given it to has not sent funds to it yet it doesn't mean it will never.

I agree, using hardware wallets on mobile phones is painful but if you got a Trezor and you need access on the go without a computer having an Android Tablet or Phone can be very handy.

I really don't think you can do it with 2 of 3.
The service provider can't guarantee the amount won't be double spent by the user with his two keys, greenaddress can guarantee that (like coinbase can).
Actually a 2 of 3 can work if the service provider has 2 keys, but would you want that?
Controls of bitcoin in one private key in our mechanism doesn't happen until you expire time and even then each time you make a transaction you are resetting the nlocktime for the new change. Also, you get emails long before they are about to expire and the resetting is all automated.
Also, the minimum configurable nlocktime wait is one day, not too bad :)

You need a third party for escrow it doesn't seem to far fetched to think you need a third party for speed.

You did nothing wrong, the app is wrong.
You have to skip the PIN as there is a bug in the app in the store.
We submitted a fix but it will take a few days to pass the review.
You can workaround the PIN by setting it later on in the "Settings" tab.
In the meantime you can add yourself [here]( and you will have access to the latest version of the app (which fixes the bugs) before it hits the iOS store.

The malleability is not about the nLockTime tx, is about the transaction that the nLockTime tx refers to as if that becomes invalid the nLockTime tx becomes invalid.
The malleability fix will mostly solve the issue with change, when you spend you will be sure that before you move your change to a new 2of2 you will receive an nlocktime that refers to the txid of a tx you have not propagated yet.
Hope this clarifies!

@_date: 2014-04-18 13:04:40
I guess my point is that if you trust and can rely on a third party (which doesn't have access to funds) you can rely in transactions from mempool, with 0 confirmations, in anticipation that it will enter the blockchain (and that there won't be double spends).
Note that if GreenAddress was ever to double spend in a zero confirmation transaction it would be immediately detectable and it would be proved with the tx being signed by us (out of band as by default our tx can't be recognized on the network as from GreenAddress)
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:22:42
It is my understand that coinbase reallocation pushes towards further and implicit centralization while my proposal is yes relying on third party but generic and potentially distributed across a number of instant service providers and more importantly it is absolutely explicit - you have to agree before hand you want the to trust a third party of your choice.

Nope. 
Our [Chrome App]( is fully static (meaning we can't change the code) and [open source](

Its even more than that, we even check against the electrum network that our server is not giving the client bad blockchain data by doing client side verification!

We send the nLocktime transaction immediately but:
We will also automatically forward the new nLockTime transaction should there be any malleability, so within 10 minutes on avg you should have a finalized nLockTime and you can always require one manually from the app.
the window is via malleability and for a small amount of time but it exists.
Of course this doesn't mean we can take the funds, just that you will only be 100% sure of your ability to take them back after  6 confs after a deposit.

More commentary:


This means that sending to an email or facebook contact that does not have a greenaddress account is going to be super slow.


This means login and tx are slow. a bunch of seconds instead of instant.
Next update which we are already working on should fix these speed limits but otherwise it's very usable and better than the web version (especially for qr scanning or security)
For those interested, the reason as to why such things are slower than even in Safari is that Safari for iOS comes with Nitro which is a JS JIT engine while the webview that runs the app does not come with JIT which means the code is slowly interpreted (reason for which we are switching the pieces to native via cordova plugins)

I would say while it's hacked but once a service is hacked is sometimes hard to say what is and what isn't compromised, especially if you don't know since when something has been hacked.
All I know is that given the best in any industry have had security holes it's safe to assume the service may get hacked and as such any measure that can prevent issues even should the service get hacked should be taken.

You can make sure that your bitcoin are there by having them in multisig with the exchange (so no reserve) and perhaps a third party too since the exchange should probably not be trusted by default.

For improved security, on Desktop/Laptop you should use the [Chrome App]( which is [fully open source]( local and unminified.
It also furthers verifies the server is not providing compromised data by validating transactions against the electrum network before signing them.
Our Android [app]( works similarly and supports NFC tag writing and auto nfc login.
I recommend the web login only via 'watch-only' or with small change in full access as if the service is compromised good code could be swapped with malicious code by an attacker.
Even more importantly, set 2FA and try to set two (we support 4 and you can use them all) if you can.
If you are interested in the design, see our [design document/'white paper'](

This ^.
Don't use a bip38 wallet with 4 random characters from the english alphabet - that's not going to last long.
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:23:13
The per-device PIN functionality uses a AES 256 bit random password to encrypt your mnemonics locally (HTML5 local storage or platform specific for Cordova via plugin), then for login the app retrieves the random password associated with the PIN just provided and a device id server side, meaning that after the first mnemonics login you can access your wallet in full access with PIN  (+2FA per transaction or security settings change).
This is somewhat equivalent to electrum encryption of the mnemonics seed but unlike electrum it can't be realistically bruteforced offline and the server deletes the random password after 3 wrong PIN attempts.
Furthermore you can access the service in watch only mode via your custom GreenAddress login, your reddit login or facebook login if you link them during registration or in settings.
This modes only displays your balance/transactions and allows you to generate new unique P2SH addresses (or view only your address book) and your keys/mnemonics are not loaded around.
Also please note that GreenAddress has 3 clients: web, android and desktop and that the last two are [open source]( and local only (no downloaded code on the fly) and unminified and they don't trust our server to begin with by double verifying transactions against the electrum network before signing them.
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:53:07
Maybe but if people are going to do something anyway maybe its worth handling it the best way we can, a bit like OP_RETURN.

@_date: 2014-05-01 17:41:20
No, quantum computers only affect our competitors :P
Joke aside, it's a good point, but I think it's not an issue as you can prevent it by making sure having the public key is not enough for an attacker to be able to generate other public/public key pairs from the original seed (which they don't have) and because you don't reuse addresses only used public keys are available (with funds spent).
Happy to be corrected on the above, I didn't write the BIP0032 impl.
Quantum computing will affect stealth addresses though if I understood things correctly.

Hey, I guess the term greenaddress can be confusing in this case and I can only blame ourselves for it :)
Greenaddress.it has multisig and with it 4 methods of 2FA, the real one.
If you use the api or our open source client you can make sure you only run the code you want.
You do indeed need some trust but less than most web wallets. 
We also offer limits which is quite a useful feature ;)
@_date: 2014-04-14 10:50:20
2of3 has many uses but:
- By default current schemes create two  keys of the three on the same computer, being subject to malware stealing them. Alternative is to create each key separately on different computers, not exactly user friendly.
- Inexperienced users will keep the two keys together, possibly online, making this scheme subject to malware again and not better than older schemes as 2FA wouldn't help you here.
- It can't prevent any kind of double spend as the user can always attempt a double spend.
Also, the current 2of3 available on the market appear to have problems with correlation of addresses in their P2SH when you spend your funds as not all keys in the P2SH are new when you reuse the wallet, so you'd have to create a new wallet per transaction and a new backup per wallet I would guess, with GreenAddress.it and its deterministic implementation the P2SH has both of the 2of2 keys unique for each transaction this making correlation not possible. 
We think privacy is important.
Our view is that 2of3 is great but more insecure than 2of2 for inexperienced users, if you know what you are doing by all means, 2of3 can do wonders for you.
Hope this clarifies :)

Same here. We have a [linux app for chromium]( too! No known bugs!


We made the mistake of submitting to Apple too early and it  takes time for them to review updates so even if we have fixed the issues it will take some time for the update to hit the store. 
The alternative for iOS users was to use the web app which of course has its own security consequences as the code is served each time and could be compromised each time you use a web wallet. 
In a short amount of time all fixes were distributed via a new beta channel we [created]( - it was our first release on iOS and we can say that we learned our lesson, is not good for us and is not good for the user to use a released app with some functionality as broken as it was - we won't repeat the same mistake again!

@_date: 2014-12-02 20:15:01


I didn't read the entire reply yet but I wanted to clarify this as it is not precise.
The pin feature when not using HW-1 encrypts the mnemonic LOCALLY with a random 256 bit AES password which is kept server side and provided back upon PIN - the mnemonics or seed never goes through our servers, neither in plain text or encrypted.
The nlocktime zip sent is sent each time you have new incoming transactions (or outgoing too if there's any change) and the purpose of it is to allow you to unlock your funds independently of us if we were to ever disappear.
The zip contains some transactions that are locked in time (work only after some time expiry) and only work if the user signs them as on their own they are only signed by GreenAddress which doesn't have control of the funds.
Hope this clarifies!
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:58:32
Agreed, we have already scheduled to change "requiring 6 confirmations" quite soon (at least for transactions that don't require instant confirmation) so good point!
Our Chrome app is designed to be as secure as possible (it double checks all transaction data against a server on the electrum network pool, it's open source and it runs only local code).
Because we don't control the facebook Javascript (nor we modify it), we decided to not include it in the app for security reason as it could, at least theoretically, be used as an attack vector (not necessarily by facebook)
It shouldn't be too hard to have two versions though, one for the extra paranoid and one for who wouldn't mind: would that be something you are keen on then ?

We do promote ourselves the best way we can/know and I  acknowledge that at times we overstep boundaries or exaggerate  the number of post, comments or tweets. 
It's hard to know if people don't tell but I do try to respect people requests. If you have any suggestion in this sense I'm happy to listen!
Thing is it's hard to get noticed even when you are a better alternative than the most popular ones, especially if you don't have BIG VC backing and all the right connections at the various coindesk/bitcoinmagazine up to main stream media.


Thank you, any constructive criticism like your comment helps us improving and finding the right equilibrium.

Different models, each has its uses and we intend to also support subwallets with 2of3 configurations and more n of m combinations  :) (our API already supports subwallets)
The main advantage of 2of2 is that it can allow for instant confirmation, more on the subject in a recent proposal i submitted to the [bitcoin development mailing list](
 It can be convenient not having to wait for confirmations, say for arbitrage or for instant bitcoin to fiat cash at ATMs.

We are working on improving the speed of the app (we also have a bounty of one Btc if someone wanted to help on github).
We think it has to do with our use of modals and CSS and especially on android KitKat Google which has made the webview perform really badly.
We are also working on a pure native app but it will take some time.
Sorry for the app speed!

[We]( are working with a number of exchanges and third party sellers to integrate our services.
This is so that they (exchange and sellers) don't have to prove reserve as they can't move the funds without your consent.
In case of litigation a third party (i.e. [us]( mediates.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:47:43
We could hold the key in a FPGA doing the signing, but even then an attacker would still be able to push a transaction to the FPGA and get the funds where he wants (which is still an improvement from having them obtaining the key but from your funds prospective not a large improvement) it would just mean that we wouldn't have to relock users funds and reissue a new key (for the ones that were not affected).
What are your thoughts?  
@_date: 2014-04-19 00:12:32
You may want to try GreenAddress but I'm biased because I'm the founder :)
I suggest you use the chrome app for improved security and definitely setup two factor  authentication.
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:47:35
cold storage is not bullet proof for newbies either, especially if not deterministic, greenaddress.it has a different design but the UI is one of the simplest and default security is best for newbes.
Once you set it up, you can watch it without your side of the keys, which can be kept in cold storage if you want.
@_date: 2014-06-25 21:19:54
Thanks for the ping !
Your webpage states:


That's not true (i.e. GreenAddress is both multisignature and multiplatform so that would make at least two of us, hence not true).
What else you say is not true?
Is your platform ready to be tried?
I tried to register and the website not only responds once every 5 but also does not return any error yet fails registration.

See below:


The regulation is not removing uncertainty from the market, it is instead increasing it. The broad and all inclusive language used, at least at first sight, is incompatible with Bitcoin’s pseudo-anonymous and distributed nature.










(g) New York Resident means any Person that resides, is located, has a place of business, or is conducting business in New York




(a) License required. No Person shall, without a license obtained from the superintendent as provided in this Part, engage in any Virtual Currency Business Activity

thanks olalonde
you are right, it is very hard and possibly we must have been bad from day one because most bitcoin media has either avoided GreenAddress or at most mentioned it once and just because some external blogger did, IMHO
In fact the [url]( to GreenAddress was first missing and then set wrong, notwithstanding all the requests via email, twitter, reddit and linkedin to fix it.
Because of that typo link GreenAddress looks as if the site is down, obviously a mistake and not malicious at all. 0_o
They (Coindesk) still have not fixed it 0_0
And that is the only mention i could find.
I think GreenAddress, good or bad as it may be, it is innovative and unique enough to warrant to get at least noticed by bitcoin specific media but no, we got [yahoo finance]( [msn money]( [wired]( [ilgiornale]( and a [few]( [bloggers]( instead

If so that's not by default, not in a user friendly way, not in a way that provides per transaction two factor authentication, etc Link?




Stored on blockchain.info server, an attacker could attempt to attack the keys in order of balance using password bruteforce. Users are famous to use bad passwords. Just sayin'


Where? Not true AFAIK


Only for login. After that malware can steal the keys.
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:00:23
It should integrate well in both Electrum and GreenAddress and reuse as much as possible of the original interface.
At the very minimum, two factor settings and display/modal would be needed as well as electrum/local verification of the data coming from GreenAddress' server.
This alone requires a lot of work, there's probably more and I will work on a more complete list but between WebSocket, authentication/login via mnemonics and possibly PIN and watch-only, the features that improve security on a day to day basis are definitely the priority.
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:58:44
Rodolfo, great work, especially the paper 2FA.

No problem at all we should resolve the issue by letting you know the state of the connection in this cases :)

[GreenAddress]( has it.  You can send to an email or a facebook contact or a reddit user (on only for now). 
It also does bip38 encryption!
The wallet is multisig meaning it has stronger security and it is open source and available for androis/ios and mac/windows/linux.

As usual, great read.
LEDs or I was thinking even sound maybe or some mnemonic encoded version of the session key on display. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:53:11
The way it works is that GreenAddress does not control the funds, the user does. 
GreenAddress just promises the user won't double spend cause it won't be able to without GreenAddress' key in the multisignature wallet.
Some third parties will accept GreenAddress instant 0 confirmations with an out of band signature.
There is no standard for this but we are building a solution that we think can be generic and reused within the industry by different providers guaranteeing 'greenaddressness' :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:59:29
Imho multiple 2FA is reasonable, so you an use one or the other in case things go wrong. Backing up 2FA is also important.
Best 2FA is 2FA that gives you TX info so that you don't risk MITM
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:48:06
Sorry that's exactly how it works.
@_date: 2014-05-03 14:32:18
good point. Malware could read the private key straight from memory.
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:59:42
There are some timeouts - it is my understanding it varies.
The notification can be handled relatively fast with phone push and if the tx is not handled within a timeout period it gets rejected and card denied.

GreenAddress does double spend prevention/instant confirmation only for  funds it knows that will get confirmed before the time lock expires.
If certain conditions are not met GreenAddress won't provide an instant confirmation guarantee.

GreenAddress doesn't advice to use the web wallet in first place, there's [Chrome]( and [Android]( apps available on the respective stores and a new native Android app available in [Beta](
The trust requirement with GreenAddress is one of the lowest available for the security provided, IMHO and even more so if you use one of the compatible hardware wallet (Trezor, HW1, Ledger).

You are right.
It's a never ending job because we keep updating the english one and don't have the language X ready in time but you still want the main site to be as clear as possible. 
We should disable sections until translated accurately.
Since some translations are contributed as CC:BY we're thinking of releasing them all in the github repo, LGPL/CC:BY, both in po files and compiled in html so it's easy to play with the app straight from a git clone.
Once the files are in github it will become somewhat easier I think managing translations in a more effective manner.

You are going to need third party trust for escrow too, bitcoin just allows to have a bare protocol but for some functions you still third party services.
As people have said many times in the past, for bread and things like this you probably won't need any double spend prevention not any more than having guards standing outside the bakery stopping you if you run away with bread.
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:08:42
They are working on multisig support, we are working on trezor support but in no way trezor is limited to greenaddress nor greenaddress is limited to trezor.
Other than that Slush has been very cool and sent us some hw so we write some code and  run tests and work with them while they implement the multisig support.
Hope Slush doesn't mind but I did ask if I could tweet the picture! :)

Good point!
We have already that on the list!
However consider that they have to steal your device, guess the pin right (3 chances and we delete the password server side making the local encrypted mnemonics useless as it encrypted with a  256 bit AES random password)  and they still need to have your two factor in order to take your funds.

You could also build it or get a friend to do it for you from the GitHub repo once we open source it.
The same applies to the Chrome app which is already open source and AFAIK you should be able to take the crx file and look inside for the unminified code (for Android this is not possible but you could decompile it with some tools.
There could also be some third party building the apps (Google Play or not), we'd be happy to join a service like that if you know any!

I think it's already on github :) 
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:31:10
You don't have to use the website? 
There are [two open source clients](
And the [design]( published explains how 2of2 is somewhat equivalent to 2of3 with our time locked transactions (also it's true that with 2of3 malware could steal both your keys at creation time or if you keep them together like most inexperienced users are likely to do).
@_date: 2014-06-29 11:33:07
Yep could be that too
@_date: 2014-05-01 09:55:52
Should the message be more descriptive on why it is more secure to use a local app?
Should we mention that the Chrome store does autoupdate and that they are better off using the chrome app from github (which does not autoupdate?)
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:41:12
No, you are right, you can't *rely* on 0 confirmations.
But you can reduce risk tremendously.
From the blog post:
Solutions to this problem (double spend on 0 confirmation) are 
- accept risk and perhaps use one of the new counterbalancing measures or wait for a number of confirmations in relation to the amount and risk
- require users to pre deposit their Bitcoins
- use a [third party that allows a secure instant confirmation](
Basically it all amounts to risk but you can reduce it tremendously with third parties.

@_date: 2014-06-03 11:00:17
I agree and we acknowledge the issue. I really hope we can deliver a native port soon enough and concurrently improve the HTML5 which while is not fast is here and is getting a bit better.

If you like GreenAddress but think the user interface can be improved I think you would really like GreenBits, our new Android app currently in Beta:

The app is designed with security and privacy in mind but at the same time to be easy to use and fast.
The latest Beta (1.22) is out and as of today it works with Trezor too :)

Not sure if [Mike]( uses [Cordova]( on iOS but if he does then we are writing a plugin for it using  which is from [Oleg Andreev]( of whom I'm a great fan!  
Using a native library should improve speed tremendously.
Maybe he can reuse some code. I'll send him a PM once we release it.

@_date: 2014-04-29 11:22:50
yes, GreenAddress is a multisignature service provider, the wallet is just an easy way to make it accessible but we are working on integrating on more clients and hardware wallets and third parties like ATMs, exchanges and major debit cards networks, we won't announce officially until it's all ready but that's the idea.  
My understanding is that the 'pick your wallet' page on bitcoin.org is going to be changed from the current 'desktop', 'mobile', 'web' to something that makes it more clear that coinbase, blockchain and greenaddress are all different kinds of bitcoin services providers and that deserve better differentiation.
@_date: 2014-06-16 08:01:12
Thank you Marni! Will do!
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:48:17
Just a clarification: GreenAddress has both 2of3 and 2of2 and the difference is that 2of3 can't have instant confirmations (so you don't get exactly the same features)

@_date: 2014-05-01 21:44:10
If you install the app from github that's pretty much how it works.
You update when you want.
But we are also making a non browser wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-03 10:14:37
Actually that's not true, our service is hierarchical and the API supports this.
Our wallet does not expose the functionality yet via UI but the lamassu atm plugin uses the hierarchical wallets to have three separate subwallets.
More info on this to come soon (and of course the UI will support this soon enough with special attention to different requirement of security for each subwallet, including 2of3, wallet sharing/co-sign/married wallets, external wallet audit for corporate, etc)
EDIT: added clarification
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:51:41
Well it does happen
Guess what? If you didn't reuse addresses you were not vulnerable.
@_date: 2014-05-01 10:34:06
We also added a warning when you try to print it so that you are told that some printers keep prints stored in local storage.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:32:39
Agreed, you can access in full access with the local app and just watch-only your funds with the custom login from any computer with a browser without risking the funds.

Nice (i also commented on the blog)
An implementation of the above is [GreenAddress]( :) Have you tried it?
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:26:27
Hello RubenSomsen
While currently we do not provide the time locked transaction in advance we already plan to do so.
Unfortunately however, even if we were to do so, right now the transaction referenced by the time locked transaction may not get included, and a very same transaction included with a different txid because of malleability.
This means that in any case until we can make sure a transaction can't be malleated (see  ) we can't really guarantee that the time locked transaction is referencing the txid that will get included.
This is to say that until the above initiative is implemented you still have to trust GreenAddress  until the referenced transaction gets included in a block with a number of confirmations.
Please note that should an event like that happen the system is already designed to email you immediately a new time locked transaction referencing the correct txid.
Hope this helps and clarifies.
About your 2FA: strange, I'll run some more tests. Please note that we recently changed 2FA where possible (email, sms) to include transaction information so that man in the middle attacks are not as likely and you may have to refresh your page a few times to see this change.
Let me know if you continue to have issues with GAuth
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:58:14
It's completely optional and will always be and it's just yet another channel you can use to send funds to someone, all private keys are BIP0038 encrypted or in case your are both on the platform funds go straight to the recipient.
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:00:01


To be fair both the security and privacy implications are very different.
Especially in terms of 2FA, with GreenAddress.it you have to provide 2FA per transaction and malware can't do much with your side of the multisignature alone if it manages to steal them from memory while with bc.i once malware has access to your private keys it can take your funds at will and no 2FA will be requested.
@_date: 2014-03-16 14:08:43
You are right in never trusting anything, that's my approach and if you went and looked at the open source code you would know that we can even disappear and your BTC are safe. ZERO TRUST.
Furthermore, not a shell company at all. Do you know what a shell company is?
I'm the founder, resident in EU and I registered there on my name because of how the MSFA has handled the Bitcoin regulation and because there are others like [Exante]( which have done the leg work.
In EU you can open your company in any of the member countries.
Up until only two weeks ago the [UK wanted to charge VAT on BTC/fiat transactions]( not exactly a reassuring environment!
Italy, where I'm originally from generally doesn't even know what Credit Cards are yet.
The best solution for me was Malta, given the limited information available in the regulatory environment: care to suggest what other options I should have taken back in 2013 ?
 
@_date: 2014-12-29 15:13:18
The user keeps two keys and one key is kept by GreenAddress with usual 2FA.
You can add one subaccount in 2of3 by going in the Settings page, under Accounts.
Currently the third key is a set of mnemonics via the UI but we are working to add support for xpubs and more hardware wallets in the same 2of3 or n of m.
Recovery is handled by an Electrum plugin that with the user two keys loads the wallet ready to sign transactions (current situation is the patch has been submitted to Electrum as a plugin and can be used directly by using our repo branch)

It's fair to add that the it can be disabled in the GreenAddress case because the second signature in the multisig acts as a protection against man in the middle and can be verified by sms or email before finalizing a transactions - which effectively acts as your display :)
@_date: 2014-07-30 09:57:10
Hello, good article :)
What issue did you have with GreenAddress and PIN? We'd like to solve it if there's a problem :)
Just for clarification, the PIN is used for login in full mode (same as with mnemonic passphrase) and it only work for the specific device you set it up with (i.e. you can't use the PIN on a different device unless you set it up on the different device too).
If I may I would to point out that GreenAddress supports multiple currencies and sources and that while it doesn't yet have sub-accounts/sub-wallets exposed in the UI it is fully HD BIP32 and subaccounts/wallets are possible via the API as-is.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:39:13
We can add the option sure!
Yeah multisig and multiple recipients are both in the works together with the payment protocol.
We are not implementing 2of3 wallets (at least yet) but there are going to be some 2of3 implementation for other purposes soon.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:27:18
We are about to improve it and open source it.
It will have like our Chrome App independent blockchain verification via Electrum network (atm it doesn't have it)
@_date: 2014-04-05 10:45:54
There was a conversation about this yesterday/today in  on irc
Apparently some AV go crazy on some signatures, more info in the logs.
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:50:05
I think you will like better 2of2 when people with 2of3 will have to wait on average 10 minutes for transaction confirmations at atms and you won't :D
We going to publish more information and videos about this soon :)
@_date: 2014-06-15 08:37:44
As said there's two things here at play:
- a mechanism to provide third party confirmation via payment protocol 
- a mechanism that uses multisignature and that can prevent double spends
You could have the third party confirmation without multisignature, i.e. coinbase or coinkite.
Other than this clarification what you say is right!
edit: didn't notice bad formatting
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:59:57
Good question!
We use 256-bit BIP39 seeds for our 512-bit extended HD wallet keypairs, as advised by [BIP32](
We are aware that 128 is considered ok in Electrum but we wanted to follow BIP32 spec, in particular because we are working with hardware wallets that have been design with BIP32 in mind and wanted to avoid any incompatibility issue.
@_date: 2014-08-26 19:06:22
Great news!
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:00:21
Should it look super complicated? :D
We think a good wallet should work behind the scene to provide you with security and privacy but at the same time it shouldn't burden the user with too much details.
Also, keep in mind that this is just the tip of the iceberg, we are going to offer a number of services which will make extensive use of multisig and HD wallets.

We followed all Cordova guidelines as opposed to Android specific as we are looking to offer a multiplatform solution which offers the same features at the same time as the web site version as well as the Chrome App.
This is  not to say that we won't use Android specific guidelines in the future to further improve the App.
Anything specific in mind?

They are all optional and some improve your security and some allow you to easily and securely send funds via social media or email or yet a fast and secure access.

Not really a bank like entity, as i said we don't actually have access to funds, it's just a third party service you may want to trust or not just like you may want to trust or not an arbitrator from BitRated
I understand your concerns; if you have a better proposal I'm really keen to hear it but it's not a simple one this one, YMMV.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:03:11
Legal responsibility is one step closer to white listing addresses (or master public keys for HD wallets).
A slippery slope IMHO.

Yep, a better explanation in faq and just some generic 'attackers can't alter apps the same way they can target websites' in the warning, to give it a 'bit' of context :)
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:04:27
True but currently the alternative is to wait for confirmations or take the risk on.
Instant confirmation, see  the bitcoin dev thread above, it's meant to be an open protocol and I do think that people will have to make a conscious choice in trusting these third parties.
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:40:11
Who picked the publisher?
What about releasing it on the internet in an open standard for bitcoin, was that not an interesting and valid option?
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:52:12
What do you guys think of 
It's an [open source]( MultiSig wallet.
Any feedback as to what you would like improved on it?
Currently working on (some are Android specific, some are generic):
- Improving speed
- Minor UI/CSS glitches on some platforms
- Improving Android integration (it's an unminified cordova app)
- Improve nLockTime feature friendlyness and automation as well as backup options
- Adding more price sources/currencies
- Adding more translations and fix issues with current translations
- Wallet manual with screenshots  and a formalized white paper
If you are a developer or a translator we are working on a list of bounties per pull requests/issues to be   announced soon (sorted casually):
- Windows Phone port
- iOS port (either with send disabled for Apple Store inclusion or with send enabled for Cydia)
- Firefox extension &amp;&amp; FirefoxOS app
- Ubuntu app
- Translations (Russian, Mandarin, Hebrew, Arabic, etc)
- Bitcoinj improvements as to improve multisig/interop with third parties
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:11:34
You have to have a backup in a safe place. 
There's nothing that can save you from that unless you decide to trust someone else with it and there's always a chance that they lose/break stuff themselves
@_date: 2014-04-19 00:34:23
They will have the confirmation via the memo field in the payment protocol while some others will use an api depending on circumstances.
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:53:13
GreenAddress certainly does.
We are also working on a jail broken iOS after we release the Android as open source (which is already in the Play store).
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:03:22
Absolutely. Device and IP/country checks will be in place as needed.
Great feedback! We really think there are a lot of options and would love to hear which the community is looking forward the most!
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:45:07
No you can do instant transactions with third parties.
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:06:06
[GreenAddress]( supports BIP70.
We also supports a backwards compatible extension of BIP70 that enables instant payments.
@_date: 2014-10-23 18:22:55
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:27:24
At [GreenAddressIt.com]( we have this feature scheduled.
Both a wallet where someone else's wallet authorization is required (parent/child) or one where either wallet is authorized (wife and husband) and possibly requires both signatures for amounts higher than X over Y time, etc.
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:35:06
We don't recommended the web wallet.
See  and try to click on create wallet :)
And there's also a watch only mode with no keys loaded.
It's true the transaction data can be subpoenaed or stolen, just like it's true accounts at greenaddress can be used over tor and never connected to any person or personal setting if the user does not wish so.
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:13:55
All client code is on github for all web/mobile/desktop
It's 2of2 not 2of3, as that is not instant confirmation compatible with two keys in the user hand.

Wow, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:56:35
14 characters from ascii? assuming random that seems 98 bits of entropy, which is much better than your average user password but is still not the best thing you can do.
128-256bit random passwords is what I generally use.

Yes it is, 2FA message also information contains amount and address, checked by the server.
So an attacker/malware has to compromise you and the service or you and your 2FA device.
Check out the design [here](
@_date: 2014-10-22 21:19:24
SMS or email to a separate device is best for security (but I guess not privacy).
Use of a hardware wallet in general can only improve the situation as it makes it much harder for malware to coordinate an attack.
Thank you for your compliments! And rather safe than sorry is also my motto, especially with bitcoin :)

Not only that but we already don't have access to the radio chip on mobiles so it wouldn't be much different.

True but importing the key means losing control, we do not want that for you.
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:20:16
We can't really easily blacklist devices, we could possibly whitelist them and enforce a certain type of 2fa on them (and not on others, etc)
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:25:03
no worries

Thank you for sharing and sorry for your loss.

If your intention is to separate funds you can do so in 'labels' and it will behave as if it were two different wallets, never mixing funds.

[GreenAddress]( - FYI it supports sweeping of private keys (I.e. from your BC.I back up)
Disclaimer: I'm the founder ;)
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:02:54
Time is money?
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:54:36
That's correct although for non instant confirmation transaction we only require one confirmation like bitcoinqt does.
Re-depositing is something we show on transactions when you send funds from your wallet to an address that also belongs to your wallet.
Not sure why was shown it if he sent his bitcoin to a blockchain.info wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:50:07
It's not removing, you can still do your n confirmation transaction and wait for 100 of confirmations before providing your service.
What you call 'add on' adds benefits by building on top, and just like escrow requires a third party (yes, by its own definition) ultrafast payments also require some third party trust.
Did you check out the [white paper]( ? We never really control users funds if not for a limited amount of time which expires automatically.
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:32:47
You are better off asking this to Luke-Jr and nullc than me.
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:51:50
Using 2fa with tx information is one way to fight this (available via email and sms in our case)
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:55:25


Not yet, we are just in preliminary discussions.
From my first look it seems one of the best implementation.
While we can detect a failed login, we can't associate it to any wallet unless they actually get the mnemonic right and even if they do there's your two factor on which can't be disabled without two factor.
We can detect attempted login for the watch-only mode but this is more of a privacy issue more than a funds security issue.
Anything particular you would like ?
@_date: 2014-03-19 09:25:02
Chrome App just pushed (we upgraded the sources but it may take 1 hour for the store to update)
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:02:32
2fa is required to change address book addresses, js can change things but won't be able to make you receive a fake name on your phone or email.
All they can do is try to send to an address hoping you don't realize or check - you can also use a hardware wallet in conjuction with multisig, i think coming relatively soon :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:28:30

Actually we found some of the issues.
box-shadow and webkit-box-shadow really slow down PIN and 2FA and custom login. 
Now is much better (will push an update very soon).
We looking into improving every corner of performance and we checked webworkers and no work was being done. Is all stuff where you should really profile the webview itself and not the JS, there's also another tool one of the guys in the team used but I don't recall it at the moment. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:45:20


I tend to agree. However it really locks the funds temporarily and should transactions not get confirmed really quickly you may still have to wait.
What I'm trying to say is that it requires quite a bit of planning and it feels it could go messy quickly and you may also end up temporarily locking up more than you are going to escrow (i'm including the potential change)
Can this really be made super user friendly? Or is it for specific niche situations? 
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:40:14

All fixes will be available in version 0.0.38
 &gt; Only one page to look at in app store, not demonstrating any actual functionality, just the login page.
We are adding more screenshots and info. More information is available on our [home](


Fixed it!


This can be disabled in settings. We are disabling it by default now as we agree it can be annoying and of course it couldn't be disabled until after onboarding.


We do not send username and password anywhere. You can enable them in settings but are completely optional and only for 'watch only' purposes. 


Indeed, very bad. We fixed TOS and are adding the links for privacy policy as appropriate. Please note that setting the email is completely optional.


We can call it version 36 if you prefer, although it is common for even bitcoin core to have a version number that starts with zero (i.e. 0.9.2.1 is the latest version) and in general this is common within open source software.
Our git repo can be found here: 
While you are right that there are some cosmetic glitches and that we can improve our QA process we do take great care in our security design and procedures and we take no compromise in this area.

See [this](
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:21:17
BashCo: 
With multisig and out of band signature a third party could guarantee no double spend.
This means that in theory you could build an exchange where trades happen on the blockchain: you get immediate confirm (checking the third party signature) but you can't spend or sell until fully confirmed.
Of course you rely on a third party to be trusted but this third party wouldn't have access to the funds on its own - which is still a vast improvement over the mtgox model.
Using this mechanism it would mean you could only trade the funds coming from the same output again by waiting for 6 confirmations (so that the third party knows you can't pull a double spend and can safely sign on your behalf ONCE per output his part of the multisig).
This is where we are going with our service.
EDIT: Grammar.

It's not going to be WindowsXP or ATMs being insecure the reason we should hold our btc right?
@_date: 2014-04-29 11:10:22
Actually, that's not exactly true :)
blockchain info keeps the random keys online on their servers encrypted
we don't keep them at all, the user has his own sets of keys and we have our own (and the ones that matter are the users ones given our time locked transaction freeing funds from the service)
GreenAddress uses a deterministic approach with the mnemonics and we offer full client side ([desktop]( and [android app]( apps which also provide extra security via double checks  against the electrum network before signing transactions :)
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:03:06

Do you use the Android app or Chrome or use the web version from say iOS?

Not with wallets like [GreenAddress](
And no, we are not behind the pool :)
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:14:15
I don't get what you mean, could you elaborate?
Bruteforcing AES with a GPU can give your more than 10M attempts a seconds and users are notoriously terrible at password entropy.
So, it can be trivial, yes. 
It's also impossible if you use a decent password with 256bit of random entropy.
@_date: 2014-05-02 10:10:16

With GreenAddress and facebook, email and reddit tips you don't lose the funds even if the service disappears.
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:01:52
We are actually also considering having some buffer you can preauthorize  (half sign)  so you don't have to take out your mobile for say small amounts.
We also implemented limits which work in a similar way (they require you to use the wallet but won't require 2FA for amounts below a fixed amount you choose and that gets decremented as you spend)
The amount one day will be renewable daily/weekly/monthly but for now we felt implementing it in a simple and intuitive way was the best way forward.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:39:28
[GreenAddress.it]( ?
Not exactly electrum cold storage, it uses a different branch of the same mnemonic passphrase but it allows to also generate new addresses off it (without mnemonics once setup).
@_date: 2014-04-30 18:07:48
There is apprently a bot downvoting people automatically.
I just upvoted you.
I'm not sure I understand your point, any deterministic wallet requires a client to the blockchain to be usable.
A multisignature one, like GreenAddress, requires two signature but even if the service disappears [you can recover your funds](
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:38:46
You can already do what you suggested with services like BitGo.
We don't offer something like this as we feel a lot of inexperienced users would inevitably end up holding both keys together and be easily targeted by malware but it is indeed an interesting possibility (which wouldn't require our service at all but would also not provide the same reliability unless you backup both devices and are effectively a reasonably expert user and never lose both devices together)
Last, but not least, this scheme allows some sort of out of band instant confirmation which wouldn't be possible with the user holding all keys.
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:54:01
No, not aware :(
Is this on Android/iOS or Chrome app?
Do you want to send a report to info / submit a github issue at github.com/greenaddress?
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:52:29
Indeed good news!
We [pushed GreenAddress]( Bitcoin multisig HD wallet to the iOS app store just last night, [waiting for review/approval](  - finger crossed. 
[Reddit discussion here]( if interested.
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:32:27
GreenAddress is 2of2 multisignature and provides in advance time locked presigned transactions such that you can independently move your funds away from GreenAddress.
See [Gentle]( if you would like to see more.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:44:02
All the issues were fixed.
While the app gets reviewed and the update pushed to the store if you want to use the latest version you can by adding your device [here]( 
Should you encounter any new issue this method should allow us for quicker turnaround.
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:07:45
It is only hot when you login with the mnemonics.
We are hoping to get code reviews but then how can you trust we didn't change it since the last review?
Openssl was trusted but reviews didn't help with heartbleed, for example
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:37:26
great work guys! 
looking forward working on being interoperable with other wallets such as [GreenAddress]( so people can each be on a different wallet and co-sign transactions :) 
@_date: 2014-05-02 22:39:32
We broadcast transaction immediately.
I had this issue once or twice myself.
The issue may be related to some ongoing work  (we are expanding the amount of bitcoind servers we have listening on the network while at the same time have internal bitcoind not exposed to the internet), it should get resolved soon, but I wonder if it's related to bc.info and their recent issues or with our work, I guess more our.
Our work should finish tonight/tomorrow on this so if you want I can ping you, the speed problem should be resolved.
@_date: 2014-06-28 09:11:34
what about insight?
@_date: 2014-05-01 22:34:38
correct, coinjoin is coming.
Coin control like? If you mean delays and limits yes, we are working on that too, is just disabled for now :)
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:45:37
We are about to do a push, if you add your device we can include yours (and anyone else that is interested!)
@_date: 2014-12-31 13:20:07
The Trezor is used to sign transactions and since GreenAddress login is based on a HD wallet signature it also allows to simply plug the Trezor anywhere and get into your wallet with a button.
tl;dr: not used as 2FA, actually used to sign transactions.
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:29:44
No, transactions are half signed and only mnemonics can help sign and spend them.
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:57:54


In few words, every time you make a transaction it would take about 1 hour to have the 100% trust that the change can be unblocked by you.
In reality you can be sure of this much earlier as we provide a new nLockTime every time we detect the transaction change.


Yes that's correct, unless you want watch-only that works with social media or a custom GreenAddress.it login.
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:50:08
We're working on adding more feedback, both visual and perhaps optional vibration.
We are also working on making the login smoother, i.e. if you have a PIN show you just that and make it fast.
We're also looking to improve the load, especially when moving back and forth to the app, which currently causes some reloads but could be improved.
Thank you for your extensive feedback, we consider this gold.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:39:58
But this is not to say that someone can't come up with some hardware optimization that is 'available' or 'distributed' as much/little as Bitcoin asics are.
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:12:56
I think you are right
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:18:38
That's fine but then it is not a disk corruption issue at all.
With this I guess ECC memory helps but then your CPU could also have a 1 in a trillion chances of getting data corrupted, what about then?
Perhaps some generation where keys are tested before use would help detecting such corruptions and I haven't seen Multibit code but that may already be the case.
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:59:26
That may well be, I'm not affiliated with coinbase and I never used their services (probably because I'm in the EU)
@_date: 2014-03-18 11:44:52
That will be how it will work for most transaction but if you require instant confirmation we can only guarantee that with 6 confirmation (because we assume that there won't be a blockchain fork that long).
I think we agree.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:35:59
Just wanted to say that despite the unfortunate name this has nothing to do with [GreenAddress]( which is a multisig HD wallet which never reuses the same addresses as a privacy and security measure :)
I agree with the sentiment of not breaking Bitcoin fungibility!
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:48:08
do you run a bitcoin node? do you know how much bandwidth it takes?
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:55:24
You can't wait? I can't wait!  :D
Optimism aside, I just hope that they really changed their policies and that if they do reject it they have feedback on what they want us to improve/fix as opposed to some blanket rejection.
@_date: 2014-05-01 23:44:14
best yes. 
Make sure to setup a couple of 2FA so that if you lose one you have a backup option (we have no way of knowing if it's you asking us to reset the 2fa so we don't do it)
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:29:39
My personal considerations on bitgo:
- Doesn't use BIP0032, no HD wallet, always reuses the same addresses, this means you have no privacy and the solution to this is create N accounts with them, not practical nor user friendly.
- I can't find the source code, can someone help ? How can you trust without the code? Is there a local client you can run? Maybe I just didn't find it, let me know and I'll remove this point.
- 2of3 is great, in particular for bitcoin enthusiasts but It's not really safe for inexperienced bitcoin users as they will inevitably keep the two keys together and malware will be able to take the funds out irrespective of the 2of3 service provider.
Thoughts on these three points?
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:52:25
EDIT: Updated and pushed :)
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:32:36
the protocol allows anyone that wants to offer such guarantee to offer the service, so GreenAddress, coinbase, bitstamp, etc
the difference is that GreenAddress does not have access to your funds while the latter two do.
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:51:35
I was considering doing deterministic builds and pushing signed hashes to github.
I actually have not investigated how you can check this in your own device and whether is possible at all, so far I haven't seen any definitive answer.
Mike, do you mind open sourcing the app anyway? we could get some code sharing going both ways, especially about BIP38!
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:15:33




Good points.
We want the onboarding to be minimized while improve the security of the accounts and some reshuffle would definitely help.


I tend to agree, social is not really needed in the setup and we will probably move it as you suggested.


Yeah we need to simplify it and separate it.




Both of these things are already on the list of things to fix, good points.


We create new ones each time and to avoid waste we ask you to click on a button on receive. Not sure how this could be improved. It's a compromise but if you have any idea we are all ears.
Thank you a lot, this is gold feedback!
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:27:53
But it does make it much much easier if he has the address and some/enough parts of the mnemonics.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:30:29

At the moment we are not regulated under the MSFA.
Depending on the kind of services we offer in the future this may change.

@_date: 2014-03-08 23:11:18
You are right!
And it should be HD, it should use two factor with their key and I should be able to recover my funds if they disappear out of the blue.
And I should be able to tip from it!
+gaittip $2 
embrace it :D
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:35:04
We will offer 2 of 3 for services other than wallet (like shared wallet/escrow/etc) but won't offer a 2 of 3 wallet with 2 keys in the user hands as we already have the nLockTime feature that unlocks your funds regardless of us disappearing and it's all open source.
See [here]( for an explaination.
And see [here]( for our model.
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:38:47
We already do that, we send an email or sms before you finalize the transaction with all the details you need so you can avoid malware doing a man in the middle attack.
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:35:41
I can confirm the issue.
It seems to go away if you refresh the page.
Working on a fix.
@_date: 2014-06-18 07:56:52
Why obviously a computer?
It may be possible to get a good amount of Android devices to work with hardware wallets via USB no?
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:50:56
Try to copy another address and see if it changes when pasted in some browser field ..
.. that would point to a malicious extension, meaning you should consider the box compromised and move bitcoins manually from a backup from a clean computer. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:47:33
Yes correct. 
We do. It is as necessary  to generate new addresses for users on the server - also used for watch-only login.
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:31:41
Once we offer the nLockTime before hand with non malleable transaction there is no time you can be taken the funds away: we think that's going to be the best compromise.
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:31:34
so like wifi but with lots of noise :)
@_date: 2014-12-28 12:45:22
Yes it will allow xpub or hardware wallet for each n of m. Both within the same GreenAddress wallet or two separate users.
@_date: 2014-06-20 15:52:02
I can't agree more

@_date: 2014-06-26 08:30:41
Thanks for reporting it!
You are right, the app in the store has some bugs which have been fixed since.
The PIN is broken in the version on the iOS store, as a work around you can login and skip the PIN and set it later in settings.
if you want to try the latest version that fixes the issue you may try it by adding yourself [here]( (it will take a bit for you to be added but once you are you will get updates very quickly)

GreenAddress has initial support for trezor (login) but won't have full support until trezor supports multisig (which I believe SatoshiLabs is working on)
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:00:40
So far it has been pretty much as you say - but things do change and banks are waking up with quite some interest around the bitcoin tech, I.e. blockchain
They are still quite critical of the non elastic monetary policy so they are rooting for something 'like' bitcoin but better but they obviously acknowledge bitcoin  is currently *the* cryptocurrency and is not obvious yet to them either if and what will replace it.
Too much anti fragility to dismiss bitcoin as a fad no longer and ignoring it is not going to make business sense.
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:25:45
It's implemented! Coming to the store!
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:07:00
Just so that you know, you can try the nLockTime and see how it works even if we are still here :D
It's almost the equivalent of your 2of3, just time shifted.
This allows us to offer more (soon to come) services.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:08:27






That way the thief knows ahead of time they won't be able to steal that much even if they go through all the work.
Might be overkill, I don't know. The bitcoin community is rightfully paranoid about theft :)
The way we will implement limits and delays is such that for amounts within the limit you don't need two factor, i.e. for a quick coffee without complicating the process but otherwise the system ALWAYS ask for two factor when enabled (and we suggest people to set it up, 3 2FA ways ATM but one more is coming soon, i.e. robot call)

Do you have suggestions as to how to improve [GreenAddress]( multisig functionality ?
@_date: 2014-05-01 21:08:47
Not really, it is really not recommended to reuse addresses.
You can argue you don't even need two factor authentication, as long as the first authentication is never broken, lost, intercepted, etc.
Let me put it this way, you lose an additional protection when you reuse addresses as by spending you reveal you public key which is not revealed before then. 
Before then, only a hash of it is known. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:05:32
Ok so it's possible that the change address was off a new private key that got corrupted on disk and never got backup properly?
If this is the case then I agree that deterministic is the way to go, in the meantime saving the private key in multiple places on disk with checksum before sending change coins to it should be an improvement in this regard as it would prevent some issues.
In which case there is no fix for OP I guess [but I do agree he should immediately backup all logs and multibit wallet files he has for debugging/investigation] ? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 11:55:55

A clever hacker that hacks in a trezor may be able to take advantage of a buffer overflow in your qrcode scanning software. You could even hack a computer by smoke signals if the 'parsing' library has bugs.

The app is open source although on iOS there doesn't seem you can verify that what you see on github is what you install via the store.
For android we offer the app via play and fdroid which confirms that what is on their repo comes from github (but I believe you have to trust fdroid or last but not least you could build the app yourself if you wanted to)
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:56:32
 &gt; He's been front and center in trying to derail  , despite the fact that it was documentation of a shipping/shipped product that had been discussed multiple times over.
We use this (as in BIP39) and we also think this is not ideal (especially after speaking with both sipa and I think gmaxwell about it). 
There are other proposal that would allow to prevent people from using brain wallets like "correct horse battery staple" and [GreenAddress]( will probably move to these once they get a BIP.
As said, there a few concerns there that are there for good reasons. 
edit: formatting
@_date: 2014-09-22 11:26:04
No, you can use the public master to generate new addresses.
This is for instance used by [GreenAddress]( when you login in 'watch-only' mode.
GreenAddress also uses it also to create a public payment page profile for users [like this one]( where each address is only viewed by one person (better for privacy).

Greenaddress provides the address in the SMS and email 2FA, if you trust the origin of the address you can check it. Of course malware could change the address in memory before you read it off the payment page so it works for addresses you received out of band not on the same device.
The  payment  protocol will help too improving the user experience

Our bad, not yours :)
And is not used in production yet even if supported by the API as our atm plugin is not yet deployed as far as I know, so you are technically right anyway.
We are working on finalizing a few things before advertising the feature, especially adding the functionality on UI since without that only developers will have access to it.
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:59:15
GreenAddress supports hardware wallet like [BTChip HW1]( and we 'half' support the trezor in the sense that we wrote code to support it but given the trezor still doesn't support multisig so we can't make any use of it yet.
It can handle login (we use something like BitId) but that's about it
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:52:50
even with 20MB that could easily happen. 
I think bitcoin will be used more and more as a settlement platform and fees will become higher as the block rewards halves, even if the block can be somewhat increased. 
I don't see extremely low value transaction to make too much sense on the blockchain although it makes a lot of sense to have these low transactions on a ligthening network like system or a sidechain and these two projects are being actively worked on by the brightest I know around the block.

There more information on the bitcoin dev mailing list [thread](
To answer your questions: There could be millions of instant providers like there could be millions of Certificate Authorities and millions of credit/debit card networks. This is to say I don't think any merchant would support more than a bunch of instant providers.
Why would a person care when making a payment? 
It boils down to one reason: if the instant provider charges for the service you may not want to pay it if the merchant does not accept it.
Mike has suggested to reverse this and make the price for normal bitcoin transactions higher (i.e. to include insurance for double spends) and to give a discount on instant, which is perhaps less transparent but more attractive for some.

It's up to you, the minimum we have set is 1 day (144 blocks) .

Hey ThePiachu!

In case of bad/worst case scenarios you can use [Gentle](  which is [open source]( and hosted on [github](
Please note, about reusing mnemonics, that unless the wallet  supported the same functionality as Gentle or integrated with [GreenAddress]( via our [API]( it won't be able to show you any transaction nor allow to spend them and it will most likely appear as a new empty wallet.

Good question:
Satoshilabs recently introduced support for Multisig in Trezor and we added support to our 'Classic' GreenAddress app for web and Chrome.
GreenAddress is multisig only (2of2 and 2of3 and soon more) and GreenBits is a new Android app in beta (we already have one but this one is native) that optionally supports Trezor (for both login via ecdsa signature and transaction signing)

We used to have in an earlier iteration (but back then we didn't use mnemonics)
We could add it back, maybe it should be conditionally shown (i.e. cases of bad entropy) ?

if you are thinking of ways segwit could activate  non withstanding the miners not signalling , and disclaimer I'm not advocating for this nor it would be a sign of healthy decentralization I suppose, is that 51% of miners or more somehow agreed to orphan any block that doesn't signal segwit. 
then miners that were not signalling would either start signaling segwit pretty quickly or go bankrupt
and segwit would then activate

As soon as you type the password your key is available on your device and any malware can take it and spend the funds.
That's not true 2FA.
And the reason they can't enable it is that they can't prevent anyone with your key from spending your funds, we can, as we have a key in the multisig, their wallet is not multisig.
Does that clarify ?
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:56:53

We store ours, you store yours (HD BIP0032 wallet derived from your mnemonic) and with your 2FA you enable our side of the signature.
You recover your funds by enabling email 2FA and email notification, you will receive nLocktime transaction which with the tool [Gentle]( and your mnemonic will allow you to take your funds away (in particular if we are not around).
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:29:14
Apparently they do also if you lose 2FA.
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:27:47
As the founder and CEO of GreenAddress I'm telling you that we support Btchip and it is both HD and multisig enabled (obviously it can work with single keys and in non multisig mode)
With GreenAddress all you need is an out of band (different device, say sms or email) 2FA with transactions details to verify what Btchip signed before the transaction is fully signed (2of2) and broadcasted.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:01:48
You are not supposed to use the same device for 2FA.
One way to fix this is have a password as 2FA which you'd have to enter, not the best security but an improvement over using the same device for 2fa and PIN.
Another option is to use an hardware token, like a key chain, for OTP (like Google Authenticator or RSA) or a paper 2FA (something like [this]( where we ask some of them or similar to the one that the guys at coinkite have implemented.
We would like to support all the above and will work in that direction.
Last but not least for the ultra paranoid we could also add a GPG option for 2FA, possibly a bit hardcore even for the hardcore enthusiast but it will be handy when we will have support for multiple 'accounts' or parallel wallets with different security measures and co-signing features (as well as audit)
Limits and delays for instance could be per account so that you can have even 3FA for some of them and things like this.
If you have more ideas, please say!

Let me start by saying I don't think anybody thinks 1MB is a magic number that has to stay forever. Some think that 1MB is what we can almost/maybe handle today and some think we can handle more.
I am in the camp of people that think we will eventually be able to handle more but not right now. Too dangerous and i am not even sure I agree that hitting full blocks is really a problem but I do agree that software has to evolve to handle the nature of unconfirmed transactions and floating fees. About time!


I don't think increasing the block size right now to 20MB will buy us some time, I think it will slow down progress and can break bitcoin social contract and its decentralization or even create competing chains. And at very least it has already consumed a lot of precious time that could have been allocated to higher priority things like BIP62 and BIP65.


There are very important technical reasons as to why virtually everyone in the core development team but Gavin doesn't wants to increase the block size immediately and by 2000%; reasons boil down to decentralization and fee market and the idea is that we should be more conservative and only prepare for a small increase to handle an emergency if any arise. I find myself in agreement with this school of thought.
Even if we want to assume that most people won't understand or care for the various implication related by block size we can safely assume that most businesses will not risk moving from bitcoin core to a different fork called bitcoin xt that is not as code reviewed and safe as the mainstream software - as it has less developers?
If you look at the contributions in bitcoin core in the last 18 months neither Gavin nor Mike are in the top of contributors, it is not hard for me to choose which code base I would trust more.
I would use bitcoin core because it is better reviewed and it has the majority of developers that contributed to it to date. No brainer.


Increasing the block size is a no brainer if you only look at the positive side of things. Everyone wants more capacity. But not everyone has a clear idea of what the implications are.
What we need right now is to work on the real scalability things including the bips I mentioned which would allow for layer2 to be working. 
We should only touch the block size when we have to and when there's a super majority consensus -  right now that is far from the case. 
edit: reworded bit about layer2
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:35:04
no, it is very relevant. you are saying full nodes are not needed which is stupid as SPV relies on it and further they (the miners mining invalid blocks) would notice because the exchange (running a full node) they want to trade Bitcoin for something else like fiat won't accept their invalid coins.
SPV nodes can't even tell if a block is valid and or creating 100 BTC out of thin air. This is not a debate, it is a matter of fact. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:46:11


That's not true, Lightening is something new and has far more consensus than increasing the block size RIGHT NOW!
Remember, increasing the block size doesn't come with no consequences.

I started testing it out earlier today for [GreenAddress]( with [this youtube video](
Nothing impressive in the last few hours, maybe I need to wait longer but I really wasn't impressed with the blogs it ended up on and it's not clear which 'virtual currencies' sites it uses.
I disabled the blog and enabled just virtual currencies to see what happens.

@_date: 2014-03-16 00:55:54
[We]( are building instant confirmation in our payment protocol implementation (we are hoping to release it in a couple of days).
We can do this because our HD wallet implementation is multisig 2of2.
The [client]( is [open source]( and it is quite hardened (independent verification of blockchain data against electrum network)
Of course there's also [Gentle]( just in case.
We have posted about it [here](
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:40:56
I think that businesses and wallets should handle floating fees as soon as possible and that soon we should be able to have the ability to increase the priority of a transaction via some replace by fee or by some child per for parent mechanism.
We will need this anyway whether we have a 1MB or 20MB blockchain as it won't be enough for all global usage on its own and blocks may get filled for long enough.
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:32:20

Hello :)
1) We automatically email you the nlocktime transactions. They are half signed by us so they are useless without your signature (via your mnemonics) and until the time lock expires.
You can use the tool [Gentle]( to unlock them, open source on GitHub.
2) The instant confirmation will be available via the payment protocol when we fully implemented it and it works by having GreenAddress provide  your counterparty a signature that promises to never allow you to double spend that particular output/bitcoin amount and that the fee and the transaction is standard so that the transaction is virtually guaranteed to be included in a block (or re broadcast-ed when out of mempool)
Thanks! We will add coinjoin as soon as we can!
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:01:26
GreenAddress is a multisignature cosigner, one kind of oracle and offers the service via its APIs or via open source clients and it uses decentralized validation as much as possible. 
You can't really have a multisig cosigner and have it distributed but you could always use more than one multisig cosigner or just handle multisig yourself without any cosigner.
We all want bitcoin to scale but 20MB, even with soft limits, is at this time a very questionable change and we should to anything in our power to make bitcoin scale without impacting the block size. 
The large majority of the core developers agrees with this and the people that have made the most contribution to bitcoin core to make bitcoin scale and support larger blocks agree with this and to me this is worth much more than some blog posts containing [simple assumptions]( and [erroneous calculations]( 
TL;DR I rather listen to who has done the work to make bitcoin support larger blocks and better network propagation than those that don't.

Cheers for the kind words. We too look forward to it.
 A few days ago I managed to get my hands for a bit on a Samsung S6 Edge device on which I run GreenBits with beta support of the Ledger ARM TrustZone Applet. 
This applet works a lot like a hardware wallet  and has direct and exclusive IO with the touch screen to confirm transaction and contains your HD seed in a place where you expect it to be much safer and probably quite expensive for an attacker to extract it than any other mainstream mobile phone/tablet without the Applet support and if felt great! feels like a much more convenient future than attaching an external hardware wallet device to my mobile! :)
Note, this is still being worked on and for any information about these developments you should ask directly to the Ledger team @_date: 2017-02-22 19:02:28

the browser security issue is real but is just potential, is not actually less secure until it is compromised, the only issue being you wouldn't know when it is compromised.
With an app, you are also not guaranteed it is not compromised. Being open source and having external reviews and forks helps in this regards by having more eyes.
The desktop or mobile apps are more secure because once you download them we can't change them as an after the fact thing like we could with the web page but this does not help you if the apps where not secure from day one.
Hope this is clear.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:41:05
I get your point - it's about external funds coming in not being guaranteed.
I think it is in general a good idea, but how do you give the nlocktime transaction to the right user when he is offline? how do you manage receiving funds on new addresses?
I can't think of something pratical to make these tx work like you described.

Actually not exactly. The chrome app installed from github has similar implications to a java app.
Just like chrome requires updating the JVM does too and I think you can install chromium without autoupdate.
It's a different language of implementing the client, should be faster but not sure if noticably so on desktop. On mobile the difference will be more visible and it's implementation is also going to be useful for servers/apis.


We have a desktop [app](
you can install it from [GitHub]( as a zip if you don't want automatic updates. 
The java app may or may not  more easily allow for integration with lastpass and things like that.


Good question and point. We are going to add 'labels', so you can separate funds under the same GreenAddress wallet and make sure funds don't touch get related to each other.

The instant confirmation uses the payment protocol and adds some fields, from a development point of view it's not a big change if you are already planning to support the payment protocol.
From a user prospective it shouldn't add any further interaction other than a clear indication that a transaction is either instant or it isn't and therefore whether the user is going to have to wait or have some other insurance policy for zero confirmation transaction of some sort.
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:30:39
correct, if you don't have a back up it isn't safe. unless you are 100% sure that the wallet is empty and that you'll never ever receive any new transaction on that wallet I wouldn't even re initialize it I would put the hw in a safe place and use a new one. just in case.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:15:01
Further to the above they can just add some extra javascript that takes all the private keys once the wallet is decrypted in the browser and just sends it all home.

I've submitted a proposal to the Bitcoin dev mailing list that received good feedback that allows instant confirmation with limited trust third parties such as [GreenAddress]( via an open and backwards compatible extension to the payment protocol aka BIP70. 
We are going to announce soon support of the instant confirmation extension with a number of third parties: exchanges, payment processors, ATMs, local p2p communities, games, on the fly debit cards and other interested parties.
They will be able to take the instant confirmation from any party they decide to trust. It is important that these third parties don't have control of the funds to avoid an mtgox situation.
GreenAddress is a multisig and deterministic wallet that offers this with no ability to initiate transfers or lock funds indefinitely.

[GreenAddress]( is against immediately increasing the block size with disregards to centralization issues, especially without consensus.
We don't think 1MB is a magic number or the final answer but increasing to 20MB today doesn't make the blockchain scale on its own, you still need likes of lightening network, payment channels and who knows, maybe sidechains/treechains. 
In our mind increasing the block size like this is just pushing the problem a little further at potentially unfixable costs.
We think Gregory Maxwell makes a great point here

Hi, what loss?
I think he is talking about dust level rounding of amounts sent to miners instead of coming back as change? It may be a good thing to avoid sub dust level change to avoid filling the UTXO set.
We have not replied to it because we want to first address some other things that we wanted to do like more features, one of them being manual fees, but GreenBits is supposed to be as simply as possible to avoid causing user confusion, for more settings we already have another app that has quite a few features around fee including per kB flag or total fees.

I agree with Luke, too easy to fake
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:52:53
I don't see any reason coming from you
Let's try to break it down


less fees: certainly less fees for miners, not good
bigger adoption: not proven in the least. I could say the same about SW (though I won't!)
bigger price: sounds like wishful thinking. Not proven in the least. I would argue that the possibility of a split chain could cause the price to crash
bigger reward for miners (both from fees and generated coins): if it's unlimited then it can't possibly pay more than with a limit. If you argued for a *different* limit then it would be different as I am not claiming 1MB is the optimal size for miners however it certainly is already borderline in terms of decentralization
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:06:56

This is not necessary for ecommerce sites and things like that as e-merchants can wait for confirmations before shipping products;
For other things, think gas station, it's nicer if you can just pay quickly without having to send the money to the petrol station in advance or wait or have some other more centralized less secure mechanism.
The difference with GreenAddress is that it actually does not have access to user funds and it is our aim to have a secure and open/generic service with a good privacy policy.
Hope you like it

We had plenty of concerns with your attitude when you attempted to retroactively cripple the license of your code but we are glad you realised the mistake.
This is the first time I hear about real concern about our attitude.
If you think this is something you can tell us and possibly something we can improve on feel free to tell us but if possible at all I would do so privately rather avoid any drama like the one with Bits Of Proof.

That's also a reasonable strategy yup
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:21:25
The only reason greenaddress does not have a good fame is because of mtgox or services that abused it.
We shift the greenaddress from the user to a third party that only does that and that can be detected and shamed at the first slight attempt by monitoring mempool. 
We would be doomed if we were ever to try and it can be detected as soon as it happens, once.

Are you sure? I thought that the utxo set is not in ram, maybe it is preferable for miners for it to be but i thought it wasn't by default
@_date: 2014-06-16 07:55:21
it's called GreenAddress because when I thought about the concept, end of 2012 beginning of 2013 it wasn't yet associated with the bad reputation or MtGox double spends and I felt anyhow that it could be improved (which I think we did).
The modus operandi of the platform is different from the original GreenAddress concept as the instant confirmation comes out of band and is based on multisignature allowing the system to prevent users  double spends.
However, like the original GreenAddress concept, it is based on third party trust, there is no magic bullet.
Hope this clarifies!

Just because i was questioning our sole requirements doesn't mean it isn't far more costly for us to run with a 20MB sized block blockchain than the current one, but that's far from the problem if only it scaled better than linearly with usage.
Which it could, it could scale better then linear with some soft fork enabled technology -  if people have a tiny bit of patient, with things like the lightening network and alike we can actually do get bitcoin to scale much better.


This is more than just CPU, is a mix of things, from cpu to ram to network to disk.

IMHo there is an incentive.
I was chatting on  and even satoshi dice had to move from 0 confs to 1 conf as one pool decided to attack them.
There are higher margins in these pools and Gresham's law imho applies.
Relatively to the pool operator, they get more value even if the overall network loses. I don't think pool operators think in terms of absolute, i think they think in terms of relative.

you can't have a child transaction confirm without the parent.

Disk doesn't concern me too much but bandwidth does so I would be cautious and conservative when it comes to block size increases - in my opinion segwit is already borderline.
Keep in mind that not everyone has fiber or super connectivity, some people have some basic DSL and bitcoin ought to not use all of that capacity. 
It makes sense that you shouldn't serve thousands of SPV wallets if you can't afford it.

that feature is broken in design and not consensus compatible. "emergent consensus" is by far a lie and simply a way to give away power from full nodes to miners.

@_date: 2017-02-17 03:21:20
2FA with bc.I only helps in the login process, once you are in if you have an infected computer is game over. to have 2FA per transaction you need either multisig or a service that holds your coin/IOU which can be very risky. 
as others have suggested a hardware wallet is a great security improvement
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:13:12
A full node protects you from invalid blocks, SPV can't do that. Invalid blocks can happen even without majority of hashing power.
miners not only make mistakes sometimes but if no full nodes validates the blocks they can start altering rules which isn't what you want (well maybe it is in your case but not for bitcoiners)

Sorry, I misunderstood.
There's nothing in the bitcoin network that prevents you from spending bitcoin that has not received a confirmation yet however the large majority of bitcoin wallets don't allow this because unless the first transaction actually confirms this often causes a large amount of distress and confusion with users.
That is, you can have your wallet that doesn't follow the practice and allows to spend unconfirmed funds. This transaction won't confirm until and if the originating transaction confirms too.

You do whatever you want, I don't have to trust miners and I don't see how they can steal anything, let alone trivially.
Knowing if a block is valid or not has some benefit (how reasonably irreversable is my incoming transaction?) as if we didn't need block confirmations you wouldn't need miners at all, mempool would be enough.

from the blog post, c&amp;p'ed:


 
















Not reusing addresses protects you from quantum computing
 






Every time you ‘create’ a new address you must also create a new private key and with that comes responsibilities such as making backups of the new private keys each time a new one is created. This is no longer an issue if you use a deterministic wallet
How to solve the issue? People should be made aware of the problems associated more clearly and services and tools like Mycelium and Blockchain.info or even Bitgo, which are relatively famous tools/services that do at least some address reuse by default , should really avoid reusing addresses before more users are harmed.

FDroid is awesome!
For the mnemonic: we also support hardware wallets, so you can keep your bip32 seed out of the app.
Being our wallet multisignature, it really doesn't make a lot of sense to show you private keys or public keys of your side of the multisig - but we have a tool ready you can use independently of us to unlock the funds at a date of your choice in the future - [Gentle]( hosted on GitHub.
We'll look at improving the UX for the Address Book, a you say, the fields are quite tiny especially on mobile and we will certainly add external 'watch-only addresses'.
I think we're also going to add to the Sweep function the ability to pick the recipient (so you can send them directly out) - but it will still sweep it all, you would have to keep the change to your own wallet to a new generated address as we don't send funds back as it is considered bad practice.
We didn't have a donation address, but since we recently release 'accounts' I just created an account just for [tips]( :)

Correct, but this is changing in the next few days to be a requirement only for instant confirmation, so that it will work like most wallets.


We removed/disabled it for security purposes, if we download JS from facebook it may as well download JS from our site, meaning we or they could inject JS stealing your mnemonics.
We could provide a Chrome App which includes it but it would be almost as safe as the website, not much more.


We apologize for that, we had some issue with the US the other day, looks like our provider (Plivo) requires a bit more handling to support ALL countries: may I ask which country your mobile number is from ?
We should be able to fix it quickly, thanks for reporting it.


There was an issue with this if there was some dust left over, this was fixed yesterday.
At the moment recipient paying the fee just means that the amount of the fee is removed from the amount being sent to the user as opposed to be on top of that.
We are looking to add more in this area once we finish work on the payment protocol.


Yep :) You don't have to. There's [Gentle](  open source and can run locally (that version is served from GitHub pages, not from our server)


Yes, we decided against using our HD master public key as the greenaddress key because it would force all transactions to be greenaddressed and it had an impact on privacy.
And besides, not all transactions need instant confirmation.
 


Instant payments via payment protocol means that if the merchant trusts GreenAddress they can be virtually guaranteed the user can't cheat them and double spend.
We could allow the user to do so but is completely against our principles and as I said above it would be immediately detectable.


We list generated addresses in "Receive money".

~~Please also define:~~
~~- Multi-User-Multi-Signature Oracle~~	
~~- Anonymous Multi-Signature Signing~~
~~(I think we support them)~~
The list is also missing: NFC, bluetooth, SPV, and quite a few other important things like address reuse (which is different from just being bip32/HD), bip38 support, sweep support, GUI/InApp hardware wallet support, regular source code updates in GitHub and or not resetting the repo, and a few other things I'm probably missing right now.

I just wanted to point out that with [GreenAddress]( the key doesn't have to be created in the browser if you use an app and it doesn't even have to be created in the app if you use a hardware wallet or the API directly.
Other than that, agree, multisig and hardware wallet are a vast improvement on the security of users wallet (by the way, we support both btchip/ledger/trezor at GreenAddress)

If businesses want to run a node in data center sure fine.
I'm just saying we need to retain the ability to run a node yourself on your own hardware you control otherwise you can't fully validate incoming transactions nor you can make sure you are being told about all transactions you received, i.e. you are trusting a third party.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:26:28
Yes, In a multisignature wallet you can and should create all private keys on separate computers.
You can sign you transactions offline and then get other parties to sign offline until the transaction has enough signatures and is ready do be broadcasted.
For best security each signer should use hardware wallet: [GreenAddress]( for instance works with both [Ledger Nano and BTChip]( and [Trezor](
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:06:35
because it is the same seed
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:31:32
GreenAddress expects the third key to be used as a recovery measure with our Electrum plugin but you can use the same seed on Ledger NFC and Trezor as demonstrated in the video.

that's what segwit does safely right?
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:33:17
I don't think he [still] supports segwit as is. he wants a hardfork and he supports BU too which at least in part is consistent and in part inconsistent, likely a political game interleaved with technical ignorance.
see 
he seems very upset with core, always ready to criticize it as if it was a start up/business when it isn't clearly - all this rather than contribute with code or reviews
He retweets BU supportive things and states things like it would be easier for Core to add Unlimited support than BU to add SegWit support. technically he is wrong but in practice given BU team incompetence he's probably right - not that it would ever happen with the current premises.
He also seems to retweet conspiracy stuff  
and more BU support 
ultimately it is to be expected imho from someone that had the arrogance to take/accept the title of chief scientist regardless of whether it applied to just the foundation or Bitcoin as a whole. it seems in full contrast with what Bitcoin is.
anyway don't take what I say,  ignore it and go and read 10 mins his Twitter and reddit and the picture will be very clear

instant confirmation via payment protocol 
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:20:47
Agreed! Great work to Andreas and all contributors!
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:28:33
You picked the wrong guy :D
I do have something just like that, 
Open source, works on web, Chrome app and Android app.
Multisignature, Deterministic, 4 kinds of two factor authentication and allows third parties to trust 0 confirmations soon via B2B API and payment protocol, so out of band.
Works on iOS too.
The only difference is that on Android I can support NFC and native crypto and on iOS I can only support picture QR and not dynamic scanning.
The real problem is that running in web browser and dowloading code from the server defeats a lot of security and this is Apples fault. I can't release a native wallet. I want to, I can't, no option is established yet and Apple could ban all the 'hacks' that people have done anytime (happened to blockchain.info no?)
What did you do? You defend Apple. And no, Apple can't be defended on this, they are just childish, behaving very badly, anti-competitive, etc

For desktop [GreenAddress]( supports it, code [here](
For android there's an early [preview]( more info in the comments, is Trezor support is not complete.
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:38:55
That means that if you do reuse the same seed in myTrezor and GreenAddress you respectively won't see each other transactions: it's as if you had two different separate wallets.
Ideally you shouldn't use the same seed in different wallets.
The reason for this is that GreenAddress uses exclusively multisig while myTrezor is exclusively single signature and as such they don't look for respectively single signature transaction and multisignature transactions. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:30:17
you are not forced to use any full node or Bitcoin for that matter but for people that care about validating data and not trusting third parties such as my self running a node at home is fundamental or are you saying that just people with fiber should be able to use Bitcoin with full validation?

@_date: 2015-01-03 02:08:55
if you have coins on the wallet you should not give us the log and in any case you should consider the mnemonics/seed compromised so please test with a new one if you want to provide logs.
To provide logs, either you can send an entire adb logcat result in a file via email at info or you can just send us things relevant to our specific app by doing:
adb logcat | grep greenaddress
As a last resource, could you tape in a small video clip what happens when the app starts and you procede on the trezor with signing?
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:02:16
you can always have different wallets by using a different BIP32 structure, in thsi specific case though the difference is that all addresses are P2SH in multisig
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:54:06
I disagree, the size increase part is probably the least important or interesting part. you can only increase the size so much anyway without compromising decentralization and with it censorship resistance
if segwit doesn't pass I think the status quo is what we'd have though I'd be also happy if sewgit gets proposed again without size increase (should it not pass in its current form)
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:52:47

gotcha, so, maybe Nando should think of nodes that accept but don't propagate segwit signaling blocks instead! ;)

@_date: 2016-01-17 13:16:16
You can have more implementation of the core code but you can't have multiple implementation of the rules (spec) which is what classic is trying to do - only problem we can't have a browser (cryptocurrency network) that allows multiple specs (rules) - you can't fork peoples money in two.

[GreenAddress]( for iOS sets fees dynamically for you but still allows to set manual fees if you want (though it doesn't allow below the minimum relay fee).
Before you complete the transaction you get to review the fee details.

The block size will be increased when the network can handle it because even with lightening networks, payment channels and sidechains you will still need more space to accomodate a lot of traffic. Nobody wants to stay with 1MB forever.
The issue is that we should be careful with this change and only increase as we have no choice and we are all pretty much in consensus to increase.  
Meanwhile we can work on other more urgent things that would *actually* make bitcoin scale.
If we also want to keep some tiny increase change ready for emergencies I'm also down for that as to speed up deployments in a crisis but other than that it seems like the network still has ways to go before this is needed and or doable without being as dangerous as it would be now.
@_date: 2015-01-17 05:32:48
with decent pairing it can be made secure however it would require a separate and powerful enough rechargeable battery which changes a lot the usability, durability, cost, etc
Please note that GreenAddress doesn't make hardware wallets, for some bluetooth wallet you would need to ask the Ledger guys or other hardware wallet manufacturers.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:25:01

@_date: 2017-02-23 18:59:52


No it is not. Bitcoin is a voluntary, opt-in, currency. You can use any software that is consensus compatible to interface to it (although I would make sure to use exactly the same consensus rules and code to avoid any bug or potential for forking away and losing lots of money)


Where did I say forced? Seems like you are making up things. People choose to run.


Tell that to the pool that recently lost over 12.5 BTC because they mined a block with BU ...


No I think you are missing the point. What you see as antagonism is called "peer review" and what you are suggesting is giving more power to the miners from full nodes because to a certain extend you have to trust the miners already but you don't have to trust them if you run a full node - you validate and ignore anything miners may try to impose.


Like what? In any case, BU just makes that worse not better so I don't see your point.
Now fine you talk about politicians but you ignored paypal, which is a business, not unlike miners, so ... anything more you have to say about how my analogies are so wrong?
And I could argue that in many countries being a politician IS a business :(

The reason you can't login with Trezor is that GreenAddress is multisignature only and you can't just use it as a replacement for mytrezor.com.
If you never created a wallet at GreenAddress you can't just use any random seed and use it to access your wallet, you have to pair it when you create the wallet.
We are working on finalizing support to make this more obvious.
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:57:12
True, i forgot
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:04:15
The pin or passphrase will work with GreenAddress and you can probably keep using both mytrezor.com and GreenAddress however you won't see the same transactions and from a security prospective is probably better to use different seed for different wallets.
If you just use mytrezor.com to setup the trezor is perfectly fine.
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:56:51
thanks again!
You got three options:
1) use the seed already on the trezor (with PIN or passphrase support)
2) use an empty Trezor and generate with the same button as above the seed directly on the Trezor (no pin or passphrase support for now)
3) write your existing GreenAddress seed (or a new one as you create your new GA wallet) to your Trezor
The last one is the least secure but at the same time it is the simplest and in conjunction with GreenAddress multisignature and 2FA it is not enough for a hacker to steal your mnemonic seed to steal your funds, even if indeed they caught your mnemonics/seed this one time you wrote it to the Trezor.
If you want the strongest security I suggest you enable the 2FA (two so you don't get locked out if you lose one of them) and setup the Trezor on mytrezor.com with passphrase (PIN is not as secure IMHO), then use the seed already on the trezor from GreenAddress.

@_date: 2015-01-17 12:52:03
not just that, they also need the zip with the presigned transactions
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:56:45
You are correct and we are adding in the 2of3 the possibility that the third key (the second user key) be a Trezor. You can kind of already do it if you can get an xpub from your Trezor from elsewhere (we recently added xpub support).
As to using Trezor or other hardware wallet as 2FA is certainly an option, although we also have velocity limit that allow to you to bypass 2FA for some day to day cases and seems easier than handling 2FA on a Trezor which could be used for signing transactions instead. 
Reusing the same Trezor for signing and 2FA is probably not adding extra security. Using two different ones can improve security but I think it may be even better to use two devices from two different manufacturers to make it more secure.
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:49:47
with GreenAddress (multisig) you get an out of band message with all details before you sign although the Ledger guys said the device will come with a e-ink screen later in the year

If the attacker outspend and take down all high fee transaction (which is very expensive) he can absolutely fill a twice as large block size with cheap fees transaction -- the real fix to this is for wallets to upgrade and adopt features like opt-in rbf and cpfp - miners can do out of band deals but if there's a public more profitable and standard mechanism they will just use that instead, especially as it provides a better block propagation compared to using cheap out of band transactions)
How expensive would it be to delay for 24 hours all high fee (&gt; estimatefee 1) transactions compared to fill a 2MB block for 24 hours?

Why using the GreenAddress PIN feature if you got a Trezor instead?  Use that to sign transactions instead of the phone two factor device and then a thief has to steal both the phone, the trezor and any pin or passphrase you may have on your Trezor. 


If GreenAddress is not available you wouldn't use GreenAddress but use instead the plugin we developed for Electrum to recover the funds from the 2of3.

First of all I think that interfaces can't be really copyrighted. Even in the Oracle vs Google case the friction wasn't on the interface so much but on a couple of lines regarding the implementation as far as I remember.
Second, I believe TREZOR already has some compatible devices produced by other manufacturers and the project is open source. Maybe the issue is that you'd have to open source your code as well, not sure but i believe reimplementing interfaces doesn't imply being a derivative.
Should be easy enough to ask directly the founders: and I'm also pretty sure would be supportive (Ledger) if you wanted to implement that interface instead or as well.

GreenAddress does work but we have not communicated effectively the fact that you can't use any seed with it, you have to first pair it which can be done on the signup page or if you already have a  GreenAddress wallet in the settings page. 
TL;dr: can't use GreenAddress as a substitute for mytrezor or viceversa for the same seed/wallet, and even if you reuse the seed during pairing (which is not ideal) you won't be seeing the same transaction/wallet.

I think there is some confusion, you can't give GreenAddress your Trezor seed however if you already have one on your Trezor and you wish to reuse it with GreenAddress you can (all while the seed never leaves your Trezor), or you can create a new one as you wish.

Don't get fooled, he is good at blogging but starting with crazy values like infinity/8GB/20M (which tests proved were reckless) is not compromising, is being a good politician.

yup, saw your post on bitcointalk (i'm assuming it's you because of the same username and same problem)
I think it could be the different screen layout being something not as tested as regular phone layouts which are smaller but is hard to test because we don't have a Note 4.
It would help if you could provide adb logcat but otherwise I think I should be able to get an old Nexus 7 which supports OTG handy today/tomorrow.

I am hoping for competition - As I said this is not finalized and while we are speaking to a bunch of issuers and banks this is just a feedback gathering process.
I can imagine at first the fees will be high, comparable to other preload service - especially if we support only one issuer in your specific country but as more players enter the market they will undercut each other and offer fees comparable to actual debit cards.
Hard to say for sure but that's my 2 satoshis :)
I actually hope this won't last long and that more and more people will accept bitcoin making this unnecessary!

Hi zoopz,
As per our [FAQ]( bitcoins with GreenAddress are not gone even if our service was taken down forever.
GreenAddress is not your common wallet, it is a multisignature cosigner oracle which has some safeguards in place to make sure we can't take the money but also can't block indefinitely users funds.

At the moment we don't have the bandwidth and the pure Objective C experience/skill to be of actual help but I think our changes can still be useful to you and maybe others.
The main commit that can help is probably  but the ones after this one are also important for BIP38.
We kept very little of CoreBitcoin because having to support many platforms our vision is in building some foss native reusable library (so not Objective C) so that we can have one library and target iOS/Android and win/mac/linux.
Though there's no reason for such library to not have bindings for java, objective c, python, nodejs etc

We have always advised that user setup their mnemonics directly on hardware wallet when available but at the same time some user want to upgrade to hardware wallet from a standard mnemonic passphrase and indeed we allow for that - that's also how one reload his key on a new TREZOR in case one accidentally destroys his TREZOR.
Remember that each GreenAddress wallet is already multisig with 2FA. 
This is just to say that security is a degree of gray, not black and white, and migrating a wallet can be costly, a privacy concern and more importantly complex compared to loading your current mnemonic passphrase on your TREZOR.
If you feel this could be improved as always we welcome suggestion and even better bug reports on GitHub or even a pull request would be amazing.
@_date: 2016-03-08 13:01:12
The problem with doing kick can down the road 'solutions' is that they constantly postpone the real fixes and next time around people will be even louder about "just increase NOW" (with a precedent too by then!) instead of spending energy towards real scaling solutions.

Obviously 'block priority' is the transaction fee. Of course it makes sense, it's how bitcoin is going to work and incentivise miners as per Satoshi's white paper.

Holders, businesses and speculation give value to Bitcoin. the only way to hold Bitcoin without trusting third parties is to run a full node. not everyone has to run a full node but people that want to should be able to - hence miners won't create blocks that are incompatible with full nodes because otherwise they get ignored and get no reward (case in point some BU pool recently created a block that no consensus compatible full nodes accepted and they had to abandon their own chain and move on back to consensus)
so yes you are misunderstanding how Bitcoin works imho

Tl;DR; It's actually true, deleting his wallet required ad-hoc code to recover the funds and security risks/procedure and we asked for a small amount to cover costs;
He deleted his accounts and at the moment we don't have code that handles this situation; He basically sent coins to an address that was part of a multisig wallet that was deleted on GreenAddress by himself; 
Of course there are warnings about that and the wallet has to be empty for the delete to work.
It's a dangerous thing to delete a wallet however many users asked us for this functionality and this has been the first incident we are aware of; We may want to remove the functionality to delete a wallet or anyhow add functionality to recover a deleted one in the future;
Back to this incident: we don't have this functionality and in order to help him we would need to take keys from our 'vault' and write ad-hoc code that handles this situation and recovers the funds. This is a costly one off operation, both from a development and admin point of view and we asked for a very small amount to cover for the costs (not to make a profit, in fact i've also considered asking for a donation to EFF) however we didn't have the resources to provide this service yet and we were considering/planning to do it in a generic way (without requiring any compensation) so that next time this is a non-issue. 
I'm sorry it has taken long to get back after the first few emails. Unfortunately at the moment we are very tight with our schedule and I can't say for sure when we can do this piece of work but I can promise that either ad-hoc or generic we'll implement something to solve the issue when we get some oxygen.
I know it seems easy but it's actually something that requires a lot of work and security implications on our end. 
Other companies when faced with simular situations (funds aimed for counterparty sent to coinbase or bitpay; litecoins sent to bitcoin p2sh and viceversa) often have a strict policy of not accessing private keys via non-standard api mechanism and procedure in place and this is generally because of the costs and security issues.
That's why we are aiming to do it generically.
I'll email you as soon as I have an update.

This, on top of the fact it hasn't been updated in about one [year]( is probably why he's having problems with fees too low and in general I see other people having [problems]( because Armory hasn't been updated in a while.

I find it almost unusable myself on my Nexus 5 (running stock KitKat).
I find it a bit better on my Nexus Galaxy and even on my Asus transformer tablet - this has to do with the webview in Android being switched to a different one which in theory is better but in practice it is little optimized.
I tried to integrate crosswalk, which increased the app size 5 fold and was actually such a minor improvement it felt wrong in so many ways.
We are now reworking the login process to not use modals and be lighter on CSS so to make it faster - there's no reason it should be that slow, we worked such to have native plugins for crypto and for all the features that are intensive so it's really some limitations in the webview and we should  work around them but so far I found it harder done than said.
I actually made the change to make enter work but it was pointed to me that it was inconsistent if done with simple tab ordering so I felt an overall change to the login was due, especially if you have PIN set the rest should be separate on another view reachable with a button and not there until requested (since once you setup PIN you are less likely to use the other login options).
Thanks for the feedback and I and we really want to do everything possible and even impossible to make it a snappier and more enjoyable experience.

Nodes don't follow the majority hash rate - nodes follow the valid chain with the most work, unless you change the software to change the meaning of valid, that is.

a hard fork requires every node to update.
To give you an idea, the latest core version is 0.11.2 and has at least 2507 nodes that will need to upgrade.
More importantly there are at least [561 nodes]( on version 0.10.x
Further to that there are at least [297 nodes]( on version 0.9.x  
On top of that we have at least [189 nodes]( on version 0.8.x
Do you think all these can upgrade to a new hard fork in weeks?
For reference the last 0.8.x client was released on 2013-12-09 and the last 0.9.x version was released on 2014-09-27.

Fair enough, it's simple enough to remove permissions and test sound it's a no brainier to push a new updated version without the permissions requests.

It's an improvement (90%) but I don't think it is better than the soft fork proposed in the core roadmap, on the contrary, I think it will still cause two chains and the majority of people will stay on what they are used to even if the hashing power moves.
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:25:21
Great to hear this and I agree with your assessment that as of right now it doesn't seem easy at all to exploit.
What I'm worried about is that they may be able to improve how many transactions they need to extract the key[s] and they can always target people and make sure they have to reuse keys by sending funds to the same address.
In a BIP32 scenario once they have one non hardened private key if they get hold of the master public (which may leak thanks to bip32 block explorers or some other mistake) they can get your master private and it is game over.

Payment channels have existed for years and are a very simple multisig mechanism where value from the blockchain is transferred to someone with regular bitcoin transactions.
LN builds on top of that and creates a smart mechanism  that allow you to pay people you don't have a channel with but you are indirectly connected by means of a chain of channels. All from the blockchain with regular bitcoin transactions that will end up on the blockchain.
LN has nothing to do with sidechains.
As the author of the blog post said, if you are quite distant from bitcoin (and if you don't know about payment channels let's me honestly say you're not on top of the game) you would think his piece is an attack to Mike but nothing could be further from the truth - Mike has been a pathological lier doing politics to deceive people for years now.

The bitcoin.conf file is editable from the app and i am thinking of adding the option eventually as a nice checkbox in the settings menu but that's not the only way of using this app.
It really depends on how you use it. One of the mode (default) is to use it as a remote node on a light wallet that supports spv validation (over tor) and you can't run pruning in this mode.

As someone that worked for years with enterprise software in financial institutions allow me to be *horrified* by your suggestions.
If Oracle or RedHat *forced everyone* to upgrade with a *one month notice* customers would *run away in no time*. 
I'm serious.
This is not some sort of security vulnerability that requires urgent fixing - this forced upgrade 'solution' is a contentious hard fork where plenty of people are disagreeing with both the solution and the credibility of the team behind the solution.
The fact that 75% of miners are ready doesn't mean that 1 month is enough for the businesses to upgrade - far from it.

You are right, we should have acknowledged the report on GitHub (I just did) and it makes sense for you to think badly of no reply to that.
I personally apologize for the issues on supports on both private emails and GitHub issues, I personally went through all of them but they happened to be at a time where all our focus was on a change of our infrastructure (deployment and autoscaling, which was successful so far) that took most of our time and as I said in my previous post I wanted to sort out all the issues before replying to support but we are just getting around finishing the fixes and polishing.
Thanks as always for your work and for amending your post.

Yes, NFC Ledger can use any seed.

The contentious change of a vocal minority that will result in an altcoin is of no interest to me and I believe to be off topic here. clearly if it wasn't contentious you wouldn't have exchanges calling it BTU in the face of the real Bitcoin BTC

with compact blocks doesn't that only happen in the adverserial case with a specially crafted block with unseen transactions?

absolutely. every Bitcoin user should prepare for it and hope it will never be needed
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:03:40
it's not contradicting, if the main chain is attacked by evil miners (empty blocks and infinite reorgs)  a change of PoW is the only solution.
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:37:50
But that's not what it is, at best it is a mining majority that has been convinced by a thread of emails circling around big companies making the Classic project.
Classic is not technical, it's political.
And i'm pretty convinced the users have been mostly deceived by barely-contributing-devs-turned-politicians who are championing Classic or previously XT.

JToomim did some tests that demonstrated that some block sizes even below 10M are too dangerous with bitcoin today, i think for this reason it can't be completely unbounded but has to have a limit (fixed or dynamic but _some_ limit)

Very good tip!
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:28:53
If you don't find value in being able to verify you are using bitcoin it means that you are not caring about the amount transacted or that you severely underestimate the risks involved in accepting large amounts of bitcoin if you can't verify you actually have them.
Lots of site have disappeared with user funds and even if the user holds the key software could be compromised (here is where hardware wallet are handy but the firmware could also be compromised if you don't verify that too) and while each of one of us will have different  security measures depending of amounts and individual situations many find very important to run a node and validate their money.
Not everyone is comfortable having third parties involved or using pseudo SPV wallets (i.e. without adequate fraud proofs) 
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:50:43
No, he submitted it to Classic because he doesn't like mining centralization and believes that if you are hardforking you may as well consider resetting the PoW to punish the asics manufacturer not selling their chips.
You can disagree or agree but that's just his opinion, calling it a troll is way superficial of you considering he had it ready for a while now.
ask him @_date: 2017-03-18 14:50:44
My opinion is that if you can get ANY 0.7.2 to sync tw/ oday's chain then it wasn't a hardfork. Sure 0.7.2 had a non deterministic bug so it wouldn't agree with itself in some circumstances but that doesn't make 0.8.1 a hard fork, it just makes 0.7.2 buggy IMHO.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:00:54
"Usage", well, whether you know it or not you were taking advantage of externalizations (mining reward subsidizing fees) and spamming the chain with dust which full nodes will have to keep forever. There are certainly better solutions than that, and it's fine when you didn't know better but looking at bitcointalk you were told back then and some people still remember - your reaction is not very different than it was then.
All/lots of your SD 'lose tx' outputs are unspendable now without spending more than you'd get.

bigger blocks == less full nodes.
we are already growing the user base yet I don't see node count increasing. many users choose to use SPV and or coinbase style wallets. 
less full nodes == centralization
unlimited bigger blocks == unlimited centralization

Yes, though nothing to be proud of.

IMO a contentious hard fork for a technicality is not healthy competition. 
Also I agree with others in that the new more centralised governance model needs to prove itself, and so does the new team and the absence of a roadmap is not great for the confidence of the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:32:54
I think they are still waiting for any feedback from miners, exchanges, wallets etc, maybe you can tell them to provide feedback if you feel you are not being listened to?
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:34:53
I understand it is alpha and some things are for convenience and bound to change so people should be patient and contribute and help improve things. 
at the same time before some advanced privacy and remote security features i would personally change the design to avoid sending xpubs together to one third party centralized provider which imho is more urgent
this is not exactly criticism, I think this is open source and the beauty of it is that people can decide to concentrate on more interesting technical and social problems and on the big picture before tuning all the inner parts
I also hope some of this experimentation will lead to some wide adopter privacy protocol across the industry
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:39:27
Segwit is doing a block size increase, and it is coming from Core, so why would you ever think they don't do size increases or won't do them afterwards? You will never get SW + 2 MB - you would want to see the effect of SW increase before making any further ones.

That may be but there are actual issues with [Armory](
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:44:19
Depends on the adoption of multisig, smart contracts, payment channels and other things.
We at GreenAddress saw a tremendous adoption of multisig within the industry.
It's still a rather large pressure relief and it provides important unintentional malleability fixes - it's a no brainer.
the majority of independent wallets and libraries are implementing support for it (greenaddress, ledger, electrum, core, nbitcoin, pycoin, bitcoinjs, etc) - the list continues, when are you going to add multibit to it?
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:44:59
The point is that others might? :) After all, some think that this place is censored when i see your comments just fine even though you are talking about BU
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:39:21
Or maybe he did send that email and Mike/Gavin discarded the email as not from the 'real' Satoshi.
We have no idea why Satoshi left. Maybe he left when Gavin went to the CIA or maybe he left because the reference implementation had enough good contributors.
Or maybe he left because he had better things to do.
I don't think we should even desire for him to come back and solve the community divide, the entire point of Bitcoin is to not have a central point of control - and maybe among other reasons this is also a reason as to why Satoshi left.

you don't get orphaned if you use things like compact blocks and if you are on a network partition like China with majority of hashrate you could still make more by making blocks that orphan American or European miners
bigger blocks imply centralization the degree is the only thing in question and how that's balanced by new user base but you are not giving any good argument and it gets boring

Not with 2of3 and with the new Android app we are adding the ability to store the 2of2 recovery zip encrypted on the phone so you don't need to provide the email and you can decide to back it up anywhere you like manually.

miners mind coins, in some cases miner can switch coin, if they do they will get paid what the coin is worth in the market. if the get the date wrong or otherwise make an invalid block they don't get paid.
if they invent a new coin that no exchange lists they may not get paid for it until someone does (if the chain doesn't die first) and market will set the price

Not receiving fake transaction because a third party service is compromised or because your wallet was fooled by some attacker is a monetary incentive to run a full node.
Running a full node provides better privacy than  asking some other service specifically about the addresses or transactions you are interested in.

We don't advice to reuse the seed across wallets, for security/privacy reasons but also in our specific case because our wallet at the moment is multisig only (2of2, and 2of3 if enabled on the desktop app)  so it will generate very different addresses in any case.

which hard fork? if there was an hard fork it means that there is a version of core that if run today would get stuck on this forked chain, correct (assuming some nodes still have the data and are available for the purpose of this discussion) ? can you show it to me?  
because as far as I know, and correct me with data if I'm wrong,  even the accidental fork was fixed by running a previous version and extending the chain for all nodes including the ones in the accidental fork thus making it simply a bunch of "orphaned blocks" rather than a hard fork aka a split in the chain that nodes would follow separately.
I think it is a huge difference but also Bitcoin is also a much bigger economy today and the damage of a contentious hard fork would bring doom

@_date: 2017-03-06 23:59:13
you don't even need to upgrade to support Bitcoin (even with Segwit activated) if you don't actively use and support segwit.
if a company adds support they added support.

oh wait, i think maybe I misunderstood, you mean accept the block but don't propagate.
I don't think much would happen other than some full node getting stuck, miners are well connected between themselves so I don't think non segwit signaling miners would have any substantial increased orphan rate

@_date: 2017-03-01 14:39:09


prove it.


what did they move to? perhaps they were using Bitcoin for a use case that is not yet well supported?  is not like any altcoin won't have the same scaling issues.


litecoin has bigger blocks, no more users.


not if unlimited, and there is an optimal size for maximum miner revenues which likely is not 1M exactly but that's not the point. the point is you can't centralize Bitcoin just because you want cheap transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:31:42
I certainly don't want to Nuke anything but also don't feel like being forced by miners to change to a very centralized altcoin

multisig existed before p2sh and it was and is supported still to this day in bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-19 23:31:38
yes ( however the wallet at the moment only supports multisig for 2fa)
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:32:08
Indeed we are using P2SH and we won't use bitcoin-xt any time soon.
In hindsight Luke-Jr's proposal was objectively much better than the one we have today.


Not nearly as many as a 2000% block increase would cause, that's for sure!
Other than that I wouldn't know how many of our users were running nodes and stopped because of us.


We are still considering what to do for every possible scenario in front of us. I don't think miners mining blocks that large are likely anytime soon in the next 2-3 years. 
The question you should ask me is "if you really think this could be a devastating change for bitcoin, wouldn't you start considering it may be time to get out of bitcoin as this can't end up well if blocks so large can happen on current network conditions"?  
Would a bitcoin without decentralization be any good? Would a competing hard fork be any good?
A business has to consider reasonably likely scenarios.
edit: updated the question that you should ask me
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:44:21
we tried it but it needs more work. we can sign challenges but some issues when signing transactions, maybe we just need to update the libraries or call one of the API slightly differently. will investigate more!

Hi - we are looking into it.
Thanks for the report
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:54:27
that they can't, typically when you say put in front means it becomes the only path to reach it
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:50:38
Then you should know that ironically it was Satoshi's vision (transaction replacement has been an early future of bitcoin that suffered some denial of service issues which have been since fixed) - it's opt-in and that it poses no threat to people/merchants (no more so than the zero conf they already use)
@_date: 2019-03-20 09:52:00
I think that's because of the hardware wallet support on Android ;)
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:57:28
I'm not even sure Bu has a hard fork signaling it just accepts larger blocks and that's it (depending on you r configuration, terms and conditions may apply, I.e. bamboozled)
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:22:26
Maybe before complaining about the network like MtGox did about malleability they should improve their own offering, dynamic fees have been available for a few releases now.
Also, I would like to see them contribute to Core, all I see is complaining about the work of volunteers...
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:02:00
Furthermore you can already do payment channels and LN without SW, it just makes it harder and more expensive and reduces how user friendly the solution can be (i.e. channel monitoring)
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:18:15
the ETA used is the one from Bitcoin core 0.17.1 . It may not be as accurate as it gets as I think the mempool have been restarted from scratch fairly recently (today) and we are working to improve that.

Then don't endorse it anymore and undo your endorsing. BTU shouldn't get renamed, it's confusing for users, makes no sense.
There are much older altcoins that still have followers and so will have any fork as far as I can foresee

@_date: 2017-03-25 21:37:11
Regardless of the form that the developers choose to use, which may or may not be in BIP form, I believe having feedback from the community would help push those proposal further - no input no progress.
@_date: 2019-03-20 14:44:55
The only time we ever refused to co-sign was when some users lost all 2FA backups/devices/numbers/emails etc used and that also didn't have the nlocktime recovery enabled or lost access to it. This is because we have no way to know if this is the original user or an impostor.
This was for a security reasons and complexity in adding a safe enough '2FA lost' recovery feature, without 2FA and without KYC/AML of any kind - we can't verify a passport selfy right? we came up with an approach that requires at least one year time lock before you can change the 2FA, + notifies all 2FA currently enabled immediately, + shows a banner in the apps to notify the user of this 2FA change request \_and\_ puts the wallet in lock down mode until the year+ has expired. If multiple people claim the same wallet then all changes are frozen and any change becomes manual.
And if you find the 2FA you can disable the change request and quickly move the funds out (especially if it wasn't you requesting the change).
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:52:09
given Bitcoin supports multisig natively without p2sh and that with multisig you can make payment channels I still think you don't understand bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:29:05
they are just heuristics ; some of them depend perhaps on context and may indeed be false positive. perhaps we should pick a more neutral color for some. We are planning to add a negative, red colored warning for uncompressed keys, and positively flag antisniping nlocktime for example of other changes we are thinking of

Meanwhile at least for Android you can find the app on [ and install the apk manually (same version as submitted to Play, but i suggest you use the version from Play or wait for the F-Droid version, if you want updates notifications)
For iOS you can find the source code here [ but you will either have to build it yourself or wait for the iTunes store to 'finish' the publishing

No, they didn't move to HD wallets yet.
This is just so that when you make a transaction the signature doesn't depend on a random component and instead uses RFC6979 which means the component is deterministically obtained.

Incremental with safety margin is fine, is what segregated witness and other changes after it are going to do.

GreenAddress doesn't charge any commission or fee for itself, if you ever paid a fee either you got confused with miner fees (check bitcoin.org out if you want to learn more about these) or you weren't using GreenAddress.

Regardless of block size limits you will have times when the blocks are full and wallet software (whether on a server and called shapeshift or on a user device with a UI) needs to get smarter and handle full blocks. 
Dynamic fees, transaction replacement and child pays for parent are all tools that wallets should adopt (or get replaced by better tools)

You pay the miner commission, not to GreenAddress. Check for yourself in a block explorer

Something like that although may be without multisig, at least to begin with. You'd lose some features like 2fa and threshold 2fa limits but otherwise it's be the same (and more private).  We are considering something like this but not quite there yet.

Did you use an app or a website? 
With a website the owners (or I suppose even hackers that manage to access it) can make the code do whatever they prefer - in this case I suspect what you agreed to in the ToS.
The same could be said about using an app but at least the app can be open sourced and get some eye balls and it is much harder to selectively target users (though in this case I presume this is not an attack)
I suspect the code signs either two separate transactions or one that pays both your recipient and them (you can check this by checking the txid)

Thanks as a matter of policy we do not remove/disable/change two factor authentication against unauthenticated requests.
Please don't take offence but without authentication for all we know you're a thief trying to socially engineer us. We have no way of knowing the owner is you aside from authentication, which you enabled!
Two factor authentication is entirely optional (you can have 0 enabled or all 4) and allows to have multiple of them so that if one becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable you can use one of the other choices you pre-selected.
In your specific case you mention you used only Google Authenticator and seems that you didn't back up the initial seed as per two factor authentication instruction and you didn't enable email two factor nor email nlocktime (yes it is optional for privacy reasons and because you may not want to use 2of2 which is optional but use only 2of3 which is also optional)
Last but not least, I understand your situation and it's quite evident this it is a stressful moment for you but please be understanding that: GreenAddress is not charging for any of it's services, we have best effort support and simply don't have weekend support (unless the service is down we tend to spend time with our families during weekends)
Please stick to official channels for support, messaging me or my colleagues on personal facebook is not appropriate.
For the time being my suggestion, with the above in context, is to keep backups of all you have (mnemonics, etc if anything) in case we can devise some solution in the future.

I didn't realize it worked in an offline environment - that's nice, how does it work? make transactions offline, provide somehow the utxo set of that wallet and then copy the signed transaction manually to an online computer? could you describe the steps?


I disagree, even if YOU can't do it the fact that many others have done review and verified the build deterministically adds to the security.


Well, that's hard to know for sure when the source code is not fully open source and I can't build it myself, wouldn't you agree?

I wrote a long answer but I decided to make it short as there's a lot of content out there about the argument:
Unbounded requirements for nodes (nodes which are required to be fully trustless from third parties) results in centralization which is not censorship resistant

We never claimed to have emailed users - all I claimed is that we told everyone that emailed us and published on reddit/twitter/our blog. We never cold emailed users in the entire history of GreenAddress other than to announce the acquisition with Blockstream.
Keep in mind that the replay protection was added 6 days prior to the fork and that we published around that time that we were not going to support it - just like we said so about contentious forks back in March.
I do believe users would like us to spend some time develop some solution to take bch coins out and we will keep considering it (just like others in the space are) however I don't think is unprofessional to say we are a bitcoin wallet and that's what we support, at least currently - we never made any promise about anything else.

with deterministic testable behaviour and no internet connection I have *some* trust with hardware wallet. Even better when I know the developers and that they use constant time and work hard to avoid side channels and have good security and/or completely/partially open source.
With software wallets running on my pc or mobile and connected to the internet the open source part becomes a must. Mainly for security reasons but privacy too.
Having the keys is all good but having unverifiable (and thus unreviewable ) software dealing with it them is asking for trouble. at the very least one should be able to review the code and build it (I am not suggesting everyone can do this but that everyone that can do this should be able to) - it's a much closer step to custodian in my view than not (IANAL)

Is 2X contentious? yes
is 2X Bitcoin? no , no consensus
is Bitpay promoting 2X as Bitcoin or as an alt that it is/will be? yes
is copay defaulting to bitpay servers? yes
therefore copay should be removed from Bitcoin . org - it isn't shitcoins org
but not to worry, a bunch of developers will make a fork of copay and backend and resubmit to Bitcoin . org

well Netflix is a thing lots of people use and it uses a lot of bandwidth therefore we should be able to handle large blocks. /s
that was an argument similar to one made by Gavin just on webpages.
Gavin is calm, open, anything you want, but seems to be constrained in his understanding of Bitcoin as if he thought is fine if only an ever smaller percentage of Bitcoin users had any access to Bitcoin. or maybe he doesn't even understand it.
I'm not OK with it either way.

Fair enough on not being open source - I guess I was arguing that even if you have a way or a partial way for code review is kind of very weak if I can't build it not prove that's what I run.

at some point people have to realize it's not just devs but other people that disagree, devs don't have any special power and that you can't increase the size beyond a certain point (like segwit does) without having massive centralization consequences.
so if in 10 years we have 2+ MB blocks and they are all full and we have high fees doesn't mean we can necessarily increase the block size. maybe maybe not.  more likely not ( though something can be optimized and reduced i.e. see Schnorr signatures especially good for multisig)

Ledger hardware wallets can't talk to the internet, unlike a software wallet - and the software wallet they provide is open source (and even part of the hardware wallets app are open source just not the entire firmware)
Ledger can also be used on GreenAddress/GreenBits wallets as well as Electrum which are also open source and on github/f-droid (at least GreenBits)
Even if they don't have deterministic builds i can build it on my own or use the -fdroid open source version and the one on github releases rather than play.
For iOS indeed the situation is more complicated but i can still build the app and run in my device if i want to.

You can increase the fee with opt-in rbf, some wallets implement that and so does a good portion of the miners.

Some offchain options are "not bitcoin" (i.e IOU) but if you use a trustless bitcoin transaction anchor to create a payment (payment channels, Lightning, etc) you get most of the benefit of bitcoin, with extra benefits (instant/speed/throughput) at the cost of temporarily locking some funds.
Only Bitcoin allows such a construct to exist without requiring third party trust.

To be fair as others have said already I would want in it more focus on privacy/fungibility and security and more science/data driven approaches in ways to improve bitcoin rather than 'feels' or unsubstantiated claims which we get far too much in this space - I'd be explicit about it. And I am still not sure I would find it right or necessary to sign something like that.

My preferred solution is to prepare a small increase for emergencies and continue to make simulations at various trades off and after we have enough data work out a proposal backed by data.
 The current proposal don't have much data at all behind them and neither of them has reached any steam in consensus.
I think any change in this area should be taken with extra care and be mostly conservative or otherwise not optimistic about future events like latency improvements and such.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:47:57
Mike, I know you like to have your own definition of soft and hard forks and that you prefer hard forks but they really are different and the ones above are all soft fork not hard forks.
As far as I know there was never any intentional hard fork.
As far as I know there's a few like F2Pool suggesting they wouldn't support Bitcoin XT.
Specifically they called it an altcoin and I wouldn't disagree with their definition, GreenAddress also won't support Bitcoin XT or Core should it hard fork without consensus into an altcoin.
BitFury said they wouldn't want anything above 2MB.
Where is your long list of exchanges, miners and wallets providers that will support your XT hard fork? Are you perhaps misinterpreting support for scalability and bigger blocks for XT? It appears you are.
I think it is sad that you decided that a contentious hard fork was the solution but I'm happy you can compete - now, I would hope you don't mind if that also means forking and competing with and bitcoin.org and bitcointalk and all the rest of it.
@_date: 2015-08-10 08:06:13
you are welcome!
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:35:02
They won't have to pay them to miners if they don't broadcast the transactions but just blocks with transaction never seen by the network
@_date: 2015-08-12 11:47:31


Never say never, during the last "stress test" many wallets like Ledger, GreenAddress and others have adapted to use estimated fees.
Android bitcoin wallet and Ninki respectively added early support for CPFP and RBF - things are happening, it takes time although I would think it would take less time in an emergency or if there were more stress test.
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:43:37
Blockstream did this in response to Mike Hearn suggesting they should get involved in improving transaction scalability, which is a good thing for Bitcoin, so they went ahead and started contributing fulltime.
Blockstream didn't invent Lightning, they are just contributing to it and just like it doesn't matter who Satoshi is it doesn't really matter why they are contributing to improve the current technology as long as they do and it's all open source up for review and reuse.
It doesn't really matter if Gavin went to the CIA or if Mike has worked for Circle or if 3 core developers founded a start up together, all that matters is their actions and consequences and from the comments I've seen from them thus far it appears that just like outside of Blockstream even within Blockstream there is no consensus yet on the blocksize limit debate.
@_date: 2019-02-18 17:29:45

No, we had a problem with our internal queues not being reachable for a small enough time but enough time to make the instance fail and the load balancer auto remove the instance from the pool even if the instance recovered by then.
We are monitoring and investigating the situation to solve the underlying issue and anyhow handle, where possible, the problem automatically should it happen again.

@_date: 2015-08-11 14:17:22
An XT fork without chinese miners and without BitFury support is not going very far, it would have at best less than 40% of hashing power and supposedly - [unless someone strategically votes for the hard fork]( - it wouldn't even hard fork without the 75% threshold.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:03:16
If it was 8mb it would have likely have been reduced a long time ago.
It was perhaps arbitrary back then but the consequences of it today are very real and it's probably going to take a bit more work on decentralization margin before the block size can be increased safely.

XT wasn't always an alt, originally it was just a repo fork with some set of patches but otherwise compatible consensus with Bitcoin.
I think some diversity and different approaches outside of the consensus code is a *good* thing.
Right now however XT has some binaries with some set of patches that will contentiously attempt a hard fork with just 75% of the last 1000 blocks with a higher block version from miners - there are reasons to believe this will cause havoc and is otherwise harmful to Bitcoin. 
If these changes weren't controversial we wouldn't be having this debate every day. 
If there was consensus about these changes they wouldn't appear in a separate fork of Bitcoin with a couple of devs working on it, everyone would be behind it like all other uncontroversial changes.
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:43:43

The problem with Mike is that he pictures this parallel world where soft fork and hard fork are the same, where only miners run nodes and everyone else runs SPV.
This is clear from his blog post when he says:




This implies that only miners are the ones in charge of block size changes when in fact nodes are very important - fundamental.
Of course that is unless they are all SPV clients which will just follow the herd/chain with the most work.
Today SPV is insufficiently developed (still insecure, still weak/no privacy) so that would be indeed a bad idea.
Look, I value a lot of the work that Mike (and Gavin) has done but I think bastardizing the language until it fits his imagination is not going to be fruitful in a conversation - even if you catch him wrong he'll just redefine what wrong means.

Pro block size posts are OK here as far as I can see.

Does it seems so weird that the same set of people that years ago thought that the max block size can't increase too much for decentralization issues didn't change their mind?
Likewise, does it really surprise you that 2-3 of the main increase proponents have always supported an increase of the max block size as the main mean of scalability?
Does it matter who those 2-3 worked with since? Why should we care that Gavin went to the CIA or that Mike Hearn has worked for X/Y/Z company? 
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:04:12


Yes, but XT is preprogrammed to not do that under certain questionable conditions. preprogrammed altcoin or p-altcoin

They are worried about Bitcoin remaining sustainable in a decentralized fashion.
They also have done most of the work and maintenance on Bitcoin in the last few years and they know really well that some parameters if changed too much can fundamentally break Bitcoin. 
I don't understand all the hate for being cautious and being data driven (simulation, tests, etc).
@_date: 2015-08-11 10:30:07
1) Not everyone cares but so what? some developers and businesses that do care don't want Bitcoin to become a centralized network
2) Fixing mempool by limiting its size is a different issue from the max block size. At any block size you may not have enough resources, thus mempool should be bounded. Most wallets have updated to floating fees. I see far more dangers with incorrectly increasing the max block size than some fuller blocks.
The best simulations available prove that an increase to the block size would provide centralization pressure. It is not that clear at all that the network can actually handle blocks several times larger.  
3) Caring about decentralization has nothing to do with having built various communities around Bitcoin. Many have tried to create competing forums or subreddit but evidently people end up preferring the communities that has built and maintained.
I don't think it makes any sense to promote contentious hard forking binaries as they are rightfully seen as harmful.
In general I think it makes sense to have other venues (for example  or for discussing implementations like Bitcoin but that willingly create a new harmful or otherwise incompatible chain without consensus.

It is my understanding that sidechains on their own don't provide much of a scalability improvement per se - however they do facilitate experimentation and tweaking of improvements, like, Lightning.

Did you even know that it was Mike Hearn that just recently suggested that Blockstream dedicates some resources to Bitcoin scaling and that it was this request that instigated Blockstream to contribute to improving Lightning?
Now what, are you seriously complaining about them contributing free open source software?
edit: if you don't know who Mike Hearn is: bitcoin developer, worked at Google, Circle and he is leading with Gavin the movement of bigger blocks with optimistic predictions on tech growth and predicts a crisis if the max block size is not increased and users have to pay higher than zero fees

I don't think he is twisting things but it is fair to have an argument about whether it becomes an alt the day it forks or the day binaries coded to hard fork are released and I think the difference is not relevant in this context given the whole XT is very controversial and divisive to begin with.
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:35:22
The block size is a factor in Bitcoin's centralization, I don't think this is disputed.
The block is a scarce resource because it influences decentralization and *that* needs some level of protection.
The max block size limit also serves as a DoS protection.
I am of the view that the max block size should be increased but only with consensus and only as much as permitted by current tech advances in latency and processing with global and decentralized focus, not by guesses and promises.

I don't think that blockstream has said anything about the block size and even the founders don't have a full agreement on one block size stance but that's not the point.
Even if Blockstream had their motives and even if Mike Hearn and Gavin had their motives (Circle, CIA, intelligence agencies, etc) it doesn't matter what their motives are, what you should look at is raw contributions, the hard data and the source code, read up on the mailing list the various simulations and what the effect of the network are.
Remember that everyone wants to increase it but if the simulations are right we may have to improve a few things before the block size can be increased and we can't be but conservative as there is no going back if Bitcoin becomes too centralized.

It doesn't do that because it doesn't need to do that yet and because it is impossible to do checkpointing on some fork that doesn't exist yet :)
The 75% "supermajority" but not consensus is not a static thing: it can become 80% or it can become 40%. After the fork.
If it becomes 40%, Mike suggested checkpointing would fix the XT clients on the fork even if there is more work on the max 1MB block size blockchain.

Depends on how big of a miner or group of miners we are talking about.
If a group large enough of [miners]( decides to [not get behind XT]( they could vote *for* the hard fork in the hope that some minority of miners will waste cycles on a hard fork that goes nowhere.
It follows that having even if temporarily a bigger cut on the chain with the majority of work means more profit for the group.
I don't know if this is game theoretically sound, there are other variables at play like nodes, economic majority, user confidence and exchange rate and new unannounced and sudden players entering the mining business with XT with a lot of hash rate during the hard fork, etc

Satoshi never said that 0-conf carries no risks - the opposite is true, he said that only transactions with several confirmations are to be considered final.
0-conf are not useless. They just carry risk.


I am suggesting that Peter Todd has no powers to force miners to run any different policy. 
I happen to believe that Full RBF is in the best interests of miners. If i'm wrong or Peter Todd is wrong then miners won't adopt it.
And with or without Peter Todd if miners believed Full RBF is in their interest they would develop it - just like they already developed some form of SPV mining.
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:41:06
and either side will think you are talking about the *other* side.
It would be better if there were no sides so to speak and we just
went ahead and refine the new proposals instead of rushing things, forcing things and taking ideological sides.
Things like block size changes should be data driven, based on analysis and simulations and so far what I've seen from either side is insufficient to make a change in the short term - never mind releasing binaries that are coded to hard fork in certain conditions.
Especially since as far as I know there has never been any intentional hard fork since Satoshi left development and especially not a controversial one without consensus. 
It would be nice if the first hard fork was intentional, to learn from it.
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:04:29


That's not entirely true, to be pedantic one could say that the alternative is that Bitcoin doesn't scale, nobody said we should scale it at the cost of damaging decentralization. Further to that there have been a couple of alternatives that provide an even improved user experienced from Bitcoin (instant and micropayments and lower fees than the status quo)


Nobody has depressed block size by reducing it. it has not been increased because it is not needed right now and certainly not needed at the cost it comes with. Centralization, in my view, is already past the safety margin and it shouldn't be tolerated until decentralization enhancements are here.


Citation needed.


I've been involved with bitcoin for some 3 years I think and from day one I was aware that the block size won't be the way bitcoin scale.
There are already concrete strategies for scaling. Garzik is not right, he is fear mongering and he should know better.

Look on Twitter, Reddit, Bitcointalk and other venues and you will find that far more people than you think are actually pro increasing supply.
Just like you will find people only for increasing the max block size as much as the tech evolution allows given the current or better decentralization metrics and not one bit more.
If the limit was 10 and not 1 it is reasonable to believe it would have been decreased by now as it would be an attack vector over a certain size (otherwise there would obviously be NO need for any limit at all and no proposal discusses removing the limit)
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:39:03
You seem a very reasonable person. thanks for debating without using insults like others have done.
I don't think we have answers to everything but if you follow the mailing list you'll find that some people are running tests and measuring data on what sizes the network could handle. This data has already disproved the original proposal of Gavin of jumping to 20MB.
It may disprove the 8MB too, who knows. At least we finally have some real world data as opposed to broken simulations on data center hardware.

I didn't mention costs. I'm confident cost IS a factor in centralization vs decentralization and possibly one of the main factors.
My reasoning is that we have plenty of solutions that can scale: visa, paypal, mastercard, american express, UK fast transfer, fast sepa, etc
Bitcoin can compete with these but not on number of transactions, it is not designed for that and it is one of the least efficient Computer Science structures if number of transaction is the aim.
What Bitcoin is good at is decentralization. It is the main advantage over other systems and if we compromise this one characteristic it loses all its competitive advantages.
Not with the block size but with other algorithmic improvements it could one day scale various magnitudes more than it can today but even if it doesn't the fact that it exist, the fact that there is an alternative (i.e. Bitcoin) is a reason for the centralized system to compete more fairly and to be more open. 
If Bitcoin becomes yet another centralized system the other systems have no pressure to improve as there would be no alternative.

SPV is optional (but enabled by default) and the idea is to use it to verify that the data that GreenAddress provides is correct according to the chain with the most work.
Unfortunately SPV while in this specific case it improves the security of the wallet it also reduces your privacy because your ISP, the node operator and even your wifi provider will know the addresses you are interested in - with this new release you can select your own (or someone you trust to not collude with GreenAddress) tor node via onion address and all data will be encrypted.

Even with the traffic jams, fairly predictable from my point of view, a wallet can provide an adequate fee and in the very unlikely event that a sudden spike delays my transaction I can use CPFP and FSS/FULL RBF to replace my transaction.
If this works in a predictable enough manner I may even decide to update previous payments and attach my new payment in a new transaction that is more efficient.
This issue is separate from the block size, at any block size you may reach near capacity and even if some people from disagree in the future Bitcoin is supposed to be sustained by fees and simulations show that the optimal amount of fees is obtained with fuller blocks.   
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:45:17
is right
Interestingly UTXO commitments are not going to work in the foreseeable future - IIRC too inefficient.
You say we *need* to increase the block size limit despite traffic being nowhere close to capacity and despite Lightning being just around the corner.
Yet you talk about having every coffee payment as a confirmed blockchain transaction and that this is not a problem because *pruning* - when clearly it can't work as *some* nodes will have to keep all history.
And when people tell you that you claim it's ok -  waiving your hands and suggesting UTXO commitments will fix this when this is nowhere near sight? 
Some consistency or clarification would help avoid misleading others.
@_date: 2015-07-19 18:27:08
I disagree that it makes the network worse but even it were how do you propose counteracting it?
If you are just hoping that miners won't adopt it then you may as well hope that people won't try to double spend.
There is no way to predict or measure with certainty when miners will change their relayfees and free transactions or adopt Full RBF and all these can be very sudden. 
Putting your hand in the sand doesn't help. Being prepared is better than not, even if it doesn't get merged in core (miners are known to patch their nodes, lately we found out about miners mining on SPV only).

To me it is clear that the issues are further than that. Among other issues many correctly believe that without fee pressure and with the reward halving there won't be enough incentives for miners to keep the network secure and decentralized.


That I agree 100% but I have to say I believe you are in the "not understand the problem at hand" camp.

There is more than one proposal being evaluated. This topic has only been brought back to the mailing list in May, before then it wasn't mentioned for years.
There are also initiatives like [ScalingBitcoin]( that aim to bring together researchers, developers to evaluate proposals and data from the network as well as simulations.
It takes time to reach consensus and we should all really aim to avoid rush things and scaling at the expenses of the liberty that decentralization and its security provides.

In terms of how much of the community I would say virtually all - I didn't see anyone disagreeing with BIP66 for example so there can be changes like soft forks without any disagreement.

A contentious hard fork doesn't risk decentralization, it risks the whole thing. Most serious business may accept a bigger block size if in Core but they would most likely not touch anything else like XT.


I think the decentralization needs to improve by a lot before we can increase the block size, pretty simple view.


In my view we should have fee pressure going forward and always full blocks or almost full.


If it is essential, I can work on making a list of who said what, but the debate is all around the place
Well some wallets where ready over 3 months ago (like bitcoin core or greenaddress). Some wallets still don't recognize addresses starting with 3, should we not move on because developers abandon their projects?

That's not entirely correct. We are in favour of a block size increase in consensus and only compatible with the decentralization and the security of the network.

instant confirmations from GreenAddress are not the future of the majority of the transactions, lightning is.
this is not to say that GreenAddress won't remain useful for a number of use cases.
either way, the comparison doesn't really match as GreenAddress trust model depends on reputation while normal zero conf model relies on unpredictable and decentralized mining policies. any anonymous miner can implement rbf or facilitates double spends with a change of policy

Maybe they would or maybe they would converge to the one used by the majority of exchanges. Hard to say!  It could even split forever. Maybe in 5 years we will have Core, XT and Vispa (contentiously hard forked from XT by Gavin). 
Hey maybe this is what Peter Todd meant by Treechains! /s
Joking aside, I find it far more likely that if miners are serious about Bitcoin they wouldn't be touching a fork of one or two or even three developers when Core has still the strongest development team behind and the same is likely applies to the economic super majority.

[Some info here](
Basically if you reuse and don't do deterministic signing there's a chance that you reuse the 'k' component of ecdsa signatures and if that happens you leak enough information for people to reconstruct your private key.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:00:19
You mean the chain with the most work. :)
And even then, not sure about it: in a scenario where someone attempts to contentiously hard forks core with 2MB blocks wouldn't really even be noticeable to core (i.e. it wouldn't follow the 2MB chain and assuming the same block version it wouldn't even notify the user to upgrade).
At most core users would notice (if the hard fork is reasonably successful) a reasonably lower hash rate which would be temporarily demonstrated by a prolonged time with blocks taking longer to confirm.
After this temporary time blocks would continue to confirm every 10 minutes as usual, 1MB,  albeit at a lower security than before (this assumes the contentious hard fork gets any support and thus the hash rate stays lower than pre contentious hard fork)
@_date: 2015-07-10 07:27:02
That's why then, the fee prioritization is not just bare fee but based on fee per kB.

As other have said, even businesses that received many $$ millions of funding don't even run their own node. You are free not to run a node if you don't want to but I don't think you should force me or other users to trust some third party and not be able to run my own node. 
If you really envisioned a couple (meaning 2-3, at most 4) nodes running inside the same data center (that's what co-located means!) then I am not sorry to tell you that what you envisioned is completely opposite to Bitcoin's mission.


As long as they can run a node it is true that they don't need to trust others. The free and instant has always been misleading. 
http is as good as https if nobody is trying to sniff the traffic. In fact, it is probably better because encryption costs CPU time.
Just because it works until nobody tries to sniff the traffic doesn't mean you shouldn't use encryption.
The same applies to Bitcoin, just because some transaction were very cheap or free doesn't mean they will always be as more people use the scarce resource. The same can be applied to instant: just because people have not started to double spend in mas doesn't mean that they won't start at some point.


If you can improve decentralization than you can either reduce costs or keep costs the same and increase capacity here and there.
If you can't improve decentralization than you shouldn't be really destroy Bitcoin's main property for the sake of being behind visa or paypal volumes of 20 years. 
If you think another coin can compete than sure, show me which and show us how they are fixing scalability while keeping it decentralized.

@_date: 2015-08-18 20:08:21
A split will happen for sure, what you are arguing I think is that if it does fork it won't last long and XT will take over but I'm not so sure about that either necessarily - and what is long: hours, days, weeks?
Peter Todd said:


75% upgrade thresholds have a lot of issues..."](
Others have said similar things. 
A vote (and at that I'd say it should be higher than 75%) in the block version number may be a reasonable method to vote in a hard fork with consensus but in a case like this, a contentious and controversial hard fork, you really *really* should be aiming for a higher threshold otherwise it really starts to smell as strong arming at best and worse at worst.

Isn't this a bit like complaining of someone making a network monitor/sniffer because https is not used widely yet?
The point is not that you should prevent people from writing network monitor/sniffer but that you should move on more secure options. And use sniffers to monitor apps and see what they do.
Another analogy, imagine an exploit 0day scenario, don't you think you should encourage responsible disclosure so that the bug gets fixed instead of suing the researcher and ignore the bugs? I fear attacking RBF is similar.
Preventing full RBF is a bit like preventing linux nodes from running bitcoin core, it is more likely to do more damage than preparing  for it or indeed embrace it and gain all the extra goodies, in FULL RBF case things like user-friendliness (no extra UTXOs required, blockchain efficiency (smaller resulting transaction in block), privacy (less UTXO linking) and costs (smaller transaction in kB thus less miner fees).

Did you ever wonder what their plan was a few months ago when they weren't working on Lightning or if you go a bit further when Lightning didn't even exist?
It appears each individual core developer stance on the block size hasn't changed particularly in the last few years - what does Lightning have to do with this then? Some new theory of yours?

0-conf is not dead with or without Full RBF.
It just carries huge risks either way and only the ones that use it should carry this risk: I don't see why I should pay more to substitute a transaction just because people want to use 0-conf.
One thing is for sure, merchants should be expecting Full RBF to become common eventually as it is obviously more profit for miners which are known to take shortcuts like SPV mining to make a bit more.

\&gt; How is the private key stored on the user device?
It's only stored if yo uset a PIN - in which case it uses a mechanism we call 'server assisted password' whereby the mnemonic is encrypted AES256 with a random password which isn't kept on the device and if the user gets the PIN wrong 3 times the password is deleted from the server, making the encrypted mnemonic useless (the device also deletes it but the mechanism doesn't rely on this)
\&gt; What level of abstraction do you leverage to securely isolate the key material and compartmentalize risk?
We support hardware wallet. Beyond that you should assume that if someone has root on your device he/she can read things from your memory, including private keys/mnemonic.
\&gt; What if a user device is stolen and unlocked? With partially signed transactions, there’s still a risk of irrevocable loss, right?
Even if the mobile is unlocked, and the wallet is unlocked (it has auto lock in 5 minutes and otherwise requires a pin you can only get wrong 3 times) then you would still have the two factor protection (assuming the user keeps that on a separate device)

update: I reread twice the question and i am not sure I understood the question correctly. It depends on what you plan to do with the wallet.
update2: if you are planning to reuse an address over and over be aware that it is bad for privacy, ideally addresses are only used once as an 'invoice id' - reuse shouldn't really cause risks other than privacy unless there are crypto/coding mistakes.
Assuming you don't plan to spend from it anytime soon:
For something like that, i.e. long term and you don't plan to touch it anytime soon, I would use bitcoin core - which does not use mnemonic but you could use a mnemonic, derive the bip32 seed and import that in core.
Or a 2of3 with Green but it requires setup on the desktop app and backups of two sets of mnemonic.
Neither core or green 2of3 seem super friendly and core is a bit risky if you mess the import up. An alternative could be using bitcoin core + electrum private server but I haven't used that myself
If you plan to spend at least 3-4 times in a year then a vanilla Green wallet could work great (but also the above or a hardware wallet ledger/trezor, either with Green or with the wallets app they come with)

It is not very predictable in the sense that you can't predict when a miner will suddenly change their minrelayfee policy or enable full rbf. Pretty much any policy change is a double spend attack vector. 
People and businesses using zero conf should use countermeasures like limiting the amount of risk they take at any given moment to zero conf exposure and monitor very closely the situation so to switch off zero conf at whim when needed.
Ideally they would migrate to LN and payment channels as soon as feasible, the advantages are many.

Businesses are already not running nodes. We should make it easier for them not harder. We also should improve education as to what are the benefits of running your own node and not trusting third parties. I presume only heavy losses will make people notice.

With or without proposal the risk of a miner going full rbf suddenly is unpredictable. They don't need to wait the others to do it.

It is not speculation to assert that increasing block size limits would increase the resources required for miners and nodes. It is also not speculation to say that as long as free transactions get confirmed within an hour there's no need to touch the block size limit.


What happens is not that you hear them cry, what happens is that they go out of business. Check on bitcointalk how many people used to mine and are not anymore?

It's still in a very alpha state but I've actually been playing around with this idea since January.
I called the project [ABCore]( which stands for Android Bitcoin Core and it's basically an Android app that fetches bitcoin core and all dependencies for the specific platform you're using (i.e. i386/x86_64/armhf/arm64) and runs core in daemon mode (or anyhow without the Qt interface) and then communicates with it via the RPC.

There's a number of scenarios, some apply to both 2of2 and 2of3, some only apply to 2of2.
The worst that can happen to the user is losing the wallet backup (mnemonic) because without that nobody can help.
An \~ equivalently bad thing is that a user could have their mnemonic in an attacker hands and either have no two factor or have that also in the attacker hand (i.e. same device) - this would allow the attacker to take all your funds.
The third worst thing is losing access to the two factor - this currently requires a two factor reset that is a lengthy process (1year+ any reminder of max(nlocktime) on your utxos). 
A variant of this is having the two factor lost and two different people claiming the wallet - this would require manual intervention as the system wouldn't be able to differentiate who is the original owner.
Another variant is the service disappearing, perhaps in between receiving funds - users wouldn't be able to recover funds received during the window  - which we plan to fix with Check Sequence Verify embedded in the script to remove the window and require less trust in the system (validated by the open source wallets for mobile/desktop). Long due TBH.
Check Sequence Verify is implemented but not enabled yet (mostly because we were hoping to have the desktop app refreshed before we did that) - I can't wait.

I am not sure I understand the question - the user needs to make a backup of the keys - doesn't have to be mnemonic could be some other format and a file instead of a string.
You could find more inventive ways of making that backup - maybe keep a copy on the device, encrypted with a password and a backup on a number of friends and family split in such a way that only a majority of them colluding could take your funds - that would require quite a bit of work to get right IMHO.

Currently when you use your own node in Green for Android it is used in addition to the Green server (which are used for multisig/two factor authentication as well as data)
Once we release single-sig as per question, that version in that mode won't require any connection to the Blockstream Green servers (but it will indeed require you to run your own node)
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:49:26


It is close enough and IMHO already more proven than increasing the block size limit.


It only has to do with the debate insofar that people are saying that Bitcoin *need* to increase the block size limit when in reality we are nowhere near to need that. Besides, it is not enough that we increase the block size limit when we need it, we should only do that when we can afford to do it without losing any decentralization.


I agree.


This is what *you* think and I'm yet to see a good reason to increase the block size in the near future. I have however seen many reasons for which we shouldn't, at least until the network gains more strength and security.

there are some and it is something that makes us upset but in no circumstances it was because of a blackhole bug - in ~all circumstances as of today it has to do with either loss of mnemonics or loss of two factor authentication.

The peer review is there, no doubts, however we can all admit that XT has less people reviewing as the ever increasing developers contributing to Core is on a order of magnitude higher than XT.
What is more secure, using red hat linux (and following security updates) or some smaller distribution with a magnitude less users and smaller distro team (and following their security updates)?


Maybe it works better or maybe, more likely I believe, as you say nobody found bugs because almost nobody really reviewed the code from Core because the proposal itself was very controversial. Was it 20 MB right? Was the BIP done before hand with formal testing (like other bips) provided?


I disagree, there's an ever increasing amount of contributors and of changes in each Core release that contradicts your statement. More likely again that only some of the controversial proposal are not being made/included but is that a bad thing given how a consensus system works?


I've seen a ton of progress, a lot of discussions, some simulations and a bunch of proposals since the first message in May after years the topic wasn't touched on the mailing list. 
Things are happening but you seem to have made your mind up and are not willing to wait any longer. No need for excuses that things are not happening.
I think is healthy that XT exists (perfect for things like GETUTXO) but it shouldn't change the consensus code controversially 
otherwise it is bounded to create two blockchains, for however long and that would be incredibly bad for bitcoin.

I don't see how you could come with that conclusion.
As far as I know all their changes are open source and they can't be otherwise (i.e. they can't suddenly close source it, the licence does not allow that)  - this means that they *do* share back and that Satoshilabs of TREZOR can take any improvement they like just like I'm sure the KeepKey guys will integrate more patches from the TREZOR code in the future if they find them useful (i.e. crypto security/speed improvements)

I don't believe in ghosts but I believe some companies I know have looked into Core's code as well as I have done and once I actually discovered a bug and reported it privately - you won't be seeing that in your stats.
 I don't know of many companies that have been looking in XT code and there may be even a few but far from the number of companies looking in core code even if admittedly it is casually done and not our full time job.

How do you know? Because of 750 out of 1000 blocks with the block version number of XT?
What if some 45% miners have a lucky streak and get 750 out of last 1000 blocks with XT block version number (perhaps with the help of other miners voting for XT but not intending to follow up)  but then post fork people find out that less than half of the hashing power is behind XT?
Thoughts about that?
Basically you don't know for real how many people will mine with XT until AFTER it forks.
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:09:02


So far the changes being submitted to XT are getting review from around 2-3 people, which is pretty normal for most changes in Core as well.
Maybe that's true in the formal sense of the review, but in an informal sense core has many more eyes on it and just because not everybody advertises their review doesn't mean it hasn't been reviewed more


Maybe a few hours maybe a few days maybe it is even longer. We don't know really but even if it was just a few hours, that would have a terrible impact on Bitcoin from a perception point of view, security and leads to caos, you can't compare a situation in which people agree with a controversial one - that is being dishonest, just like saying there are basically no differences in soft and hard forks.

@_date: 2015-09-04 07:32:32


Mike, there are many problems with your statements.
I don't think Blockstream as an entity has made any declaration in regards to block size - some individual founders of Blockstream may have but you don't hear us talk about you and Gavin in terms of Circle and Coinbase, so stop it
The second but more important point is that using the blockchain as a voting mechanism for a hard fork was never attempted and soft forks and hard forks are very different, again, stop confusing the two




There's no logical implication without redefining the meaning of soft/hard fork, without redefining consensus, without redefining Bitcoin :)
You love to do that don't you.
Stop confusing Google distributed servers with Bitcoin distributed consensus - it isn't the same thing and comparing web page load with p2p consensus network is comparing apples to oranges even though both are roundish (both use computers and networks yay!)


I don't think the problem is about being smart enough although scaling Bitcoin sure requires _some_ technical skills that your average Joe six pack doesn't have. 
I think the problem is that you redefine the meaning of most terms and that you are willing to considerably weaken the decentralization (and therefore security) of the Bitcoin network for a small and unscalable increase (by Gavin own admission) - and that's ok, such are the tradeoffs but let's keep the talks honest and on the merits of each proposal, let me beg you to stop with the circlejerk.

I was actually considering a case where you buy some bitcoins from someone (first purchase) and they open a channel with you to give you the funds but they only put those and not more.
If they do that then later on the party that sold the bitcoin could try to publish a different transaction taking the funds and you wouldn't have a way to punish them - however of course if the seller also puts some extra funds in the channel then this doesn't apply.
I'll update my comment as thinking more about it seems this is simple to solve - just make sure the channel is balanced from the get go.

well it fixes some things like hardware wallet limitations, malleability, spv data waste, improved validation. it changes a lot, not sure about "fundamentally" but what's great about it is that you don't have to use it if you don't want to use the new features and you can keep to use your wallet without two or more chains. this probably no in that sense.

People IMHO don't care about big blocks per se, they care about throughput and cheaper transactions if anything - would be great if we could at least agree on this.
That being said, it's clear that when things are contentious (and a bitcoin hard fork to increase the block size is clearly contentious right now) things don't go well - ask Kraken or Bitfinex what they think about the ETH/ETC debacle if you don't believe me.


There is no auto update and it appears the adoption of BU is insignificant compared to 0.13.0 (which was released after too!) and I bet the same will apply to 0.13.1 - it's not a matter of default, it's a matter of using more robust software, with specifications and peer review from numerous developers -  Does BU have even half of the peer review that software such as Core has? If so, feel free to show me some links. All I know is that upgrading from an old version to core to a new version of core or BU takes the exact same effort but feel free to prove otherwise.


I say the software is open source, go ahead and propose changes, if they don't get accepted by peer review feel free to fork it but don't come back to complain when nobody uses your fork.
Maybe rather than asking volunteers to do something they deem dangerous is better to try to understand why people that have more experience think it is not the way forward or at least don't pretend you can force any open source contributor to do something against their will. You try. Or are you one of those that complain that Gnome developers are not working on KDE or viceversa?

He never stopped you - you just didn't have BU before but you had Classic, BTCD, XT, LJR/Knots, etc - maybe those were not sufficiently good for you?
To that extend I don't blame you, and I hope you well but I don't think BU will be very successful - I find it of dubious quality and I have no doubt the majority of the network won't be fooled by its misguided design.
@_date: 2016-10-09 23:06:53
I'm sure covenants can be useful in a number of situation however I am also concerned about the fungibility aspect and there are plenty of things like presigned transactions, nlocktime/csv/payment channels that exchanges and other services could start to use to completely remove a large class of risk and until that happens (together with signed tickers for example) I would rather see development in other areas such as censorship resistance/privacy/fungibility.

Dear Apologies for the late reply - we should have replied earlier.
In cases like this we have no way of making sure that we are not facing someone trying to bypass security. We take our users security very seriously; We have never disabled two factor authentication for any user once they have set it up, unless explicitly authorized to do so via another two factor authentication method. We follow the restrictions that the user places on their own account without exception.
In this case the account was configured without a backup authentication method and it appears you did not backup or transfer that authentication method to your new device. If your coins are in a 2of2 account then you will need to recover your authentication, we cannot disable it in this or any other case.
If you transferred your funds to a 2of3 account then then you can move them without two factor authentication since you have 2 of the 3 required signatures. If not, then unless you can recover your authorisation we cannot help you.
We remind users during two factor setup to make backups of things like OTP/Authenticator and to enable multiple two factor options to prevent this situation from happening. As noted, 2of3 accounts can be used to avoid requiring authentication also.
We understand this is upsetting for you, and we are actively working on potential solutions to overcome this problem in the future, such as CLTV/CSV and opt-in methods of resetting two factor authentication after an enforced delay and notification of the old methods. However these future mitigations require careful design and development to ensure that they cannot be exploited by attackers. I hope you understand that it may be some time before we can safely implement them.
In the future if or when there is a solution that can help you with the situation I won't hesitate to contact you.

It's not too hard but there can be confusing parts.
We have a guide for the ledger hardware wallet: 
You can either use this way as per blog (which gives you a hex seed) or you can create a normal GreenAddress wallet with mnemonics and then setup the hardware wallet from settings.
The difference is that in the former case the GreenAddress app never sees the seed and neither does the computer it is connected to (if you follow the instructions and get the seed on a second computer) but on the other hand having a hex seed is not as nice as having a mnemonic passphrase and either way given GreenAddress app is open source and is multisig the risk surface is further reduced so some prefer the second option.
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:53:35

When you selected the amount to send did you account for the miner fees?
It is probably telling you not enough money because between the amount you want to send and the miner fees you don't have enough bitcoins to complete the transaction.
if you don't care about the fees and you just want to empty the wallet there's a button ("MAX") that will detect what's the maximum amount that can be spent including fees.
Otherwise for more information on fees this is a good starting point: 
Just as quick intro: miner fees are per transaction size (in bytes) rather than in terms of amount being moved and the GreenAddress Chrome app allows to select manual fees too.
The transaction won't be sent in GreenAddress until you have a chance to review all details including the total fee.

Saying that Full Nodes are for just for a bunch of Pablo Escobar or for exchanges is wrong IMHO. 
Just like saying that SPV is good enough for regular people: that may be true-ish for small amounts or for people that don't care about their privacy but otherwise anyone that deeply cares about their privacy and security of their bitcoins should be using a full node - I wouldn't use SPV wallets for large amounts.
@_date: 2016-10-08 08:28:10
Lightning has nothing to do with IOU. And we already have the coinbase/exchange wallet model which is exactly IOU.


While true having a few hops can be enough to reach every other node - i think the way LN will be bootstrapped means exactly the opposite of what you are saying - we won't have a few big hubs but rather channels between directly interested parties and so on and so forth.

GreenAddress supports both 2of2 and 2of3: once you setup 2of3 in the Chrome app (with a new mnemonic or external master public key) it becomes available in GreenBits too (i.e. in GreenBits you can access subaccounts but you can't create them yet)

I'm only happy if there are more developers contributing to bitcoin, don't get me wrong, but I am of the same opinion as satoshi in regards to having multiple nodes: ultimately it is very risky because unlike deciding to run a different linux distro businesses can't run the risk of getting forked out because of some bug in an alternative node - even if the node software is well supported (i.e. like Redhat vs Debian) - at the first fork/branching (which would be terribly damaging to bitcoin) businesses would move en-masse to the node software with the most market share.
Maybe this will change if the consensus code is moved into a library and both Core and BU use the same library but this is not something ready either and given the pace I'm not sure it will ever happen.

Adam, Jeff and others were talking about Full RBF not Opt-In Full RBF.
There is a lot of difference between full RBF on all transactions (dangerous for current zero conf use cases) and opt-in full RBF on transactions explicitly flagged for the purpose (i.e. not more dangerous than any average bitcoin core update and mempool misalignment which normally requires even more work for the zero conf crowd to keep zero conf 'analysis' up to date and 'working' for some definition of working)
examples of mempool misalignment: changes to min relay fee, changes to min dust, transaction floods, etc

Ledger Chrome app is a good app and the Ledger team is great yet there are some differences in features:
The GreenAddress Chrome app supports by default:
- multiple 2of2 or 2of3 subwallets
- 4 different kinds of 2FA including SMS, Google Auth, automated voice call and email with PGP support
- Limits under which you can skip 2FA (think small purchases)
- URL you can give to others that generate addresses belonging to your wallet (what we call permanent payment url)
Mobile support is also useful.
And in the case of GreenBits it also adds SPV validation on top to improve you security (although reduces privacy)
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:35:59

I personally taken part in developing a bunch of multi platform multisig wallets and it would take one line of code to detect an opt-in RBF transaction and a few other lines to show a flag/message to the user.

My current understanding w/ LN is that you can offload (if so you desire) the monitoring to one or more third parties without leaking your privacy in case the recovery action is never performed/necessary. 
This could be used by SPV wallets but the solution I prefer (which I don't think is too far fetched) is to have a full node at home (with lightning monitoring as needed) maybe inside or side by side to my internet router (which also vastly improves your security and privacy and you can use it on the go with your SPV/lite wallet)
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:35:01
I don't understand why people would be so eager to give even more power to miners
Full nodes have among other things the job of making sure miners aren't fooling them, if you start removing rules or skipping validation entirely you are allowing for more power grab by miners and you risk losing funds.

Apple and oranges - SPV is entirely in clear, web pages are mostly SSL'ed now days. My ISP and my wifi access point can see what bloom filtering I do and all SPV libraries today seems to be rather weak privacy with their bloom filtering.


So what? When I connect my full node to yours your node will have my ip in the logs - so what?


Nope. Just nope.


This doesn't make sense: what do you mean?


When did I say that a full node is better for your private key security? I just said security and I stand by what I said: a full node allows you better security and privacy.


That is as far as you know but we don't know for sure, do we?
Just because nobody initially robbed the bitcoin with a weak RNG doesn't mean that the bitcoins were safe in first place: see what happened with bc.i or the wallet on android.


You may lose money if you think you received a transaction and that it confirmed when it didn't. Also, if everyone was using SPV we would be under ruling of the miners - not a good place to be.


SPV behind TOR is even easier to hijack - SPV is all in clear and any tor node can impersonate the nodes just like your wifi/isp provider can.
I can see clearly why your proposal was not accepted.

Citation needed. they are not. miners that produce an invalid block are completely ignored. last time a BU miner tried to mine a larger block for instance it was ignored by all exchanges/wallets/etc full nodes other than BU.
Likewise, with P2SH UASF, the economic majority decided that it was time to soft fork in the change and guess what, P2SH is now active on bitcoin.
So what can a miner do really? Select and order transactions and bury transaction with new blocks? What else can they do other than sure mine compatible altcoins?

This information is already present in our FAQ/blog series/Tos but to simplify:
In this specific case GreenAddress can't simply just disable the 2FA because it has no way of knowing who is asking for this unless you had configured before hand a backup 2FA or made a backup of the Gauth code as per instructions during the 2FA setup.

If you wait for a confirmation (which you should in any case, what if the fee is not enough and it gets dropped off the mempool? what if it was enough but suddently it's nomore?) then you have no issues.
Otherwise wait for lightning or use a centralized trust service like ours or coinbase.

(a) most of us weren't there and nobody can decide on our behalf and by our I mean bitcoiners.

Disclaimer: Founder of [GreenAddress](
For this sort of stuff (2of2, 2FA on transaction, PIN login) you could use [GreenBits]( native for Android which also supports hardware wallets or for iOS you could use [this]( although it is not native (we are working on a native one but no ETA yet)
For desktop you can use the [Chrome App]( which also supports hardware wallets and we have a page/apps for [testnet]( too if you want to give it a try first.
If you decide to use it seriously I suggest you read our [FAQ]( and [best practices](

there are some options for Trezor but as far as I know the only wallet that supports Trezor on both Android (GreenBits) and on Desktop (Chrome App) is [GreenAddress]( 
Please note that it would be best (for both privacy and security reasons)  if you didn't reuse the mnemonic passphrase across different wallets.
Otherwise Electrum should do for desktop only and i think they are working on an android app.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:24:04
Modern wallet allow for multiple addresses all derived from the same seed and the wallet avoid reuse so the address changes but it still belongs to your wallet (and you shouldn't reuse it but if it happens generally it mostly impacts your privacy)
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:11:02
You can find some info in the article and for any specific wallet you are better off asking the specific author what their plans are. Some (as per the article) only tell you once they see a second transaction unfortunately.
Keep in mind that we are only offering the bump service so you can't change the recipient.
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:58:57
it's unfortunate but it is the truth. I can live with a Bitcoin that has limits to keep decentralization. what I don't want to happen is Bitcoin to become same same as our current banking system, it is too important to lose.

I wasn't invited to the agreement which should have been inclusive and open to begin with and which is ignoring all feedback from the community so I really don't care what they are going to do I think the Bitcoin network will rightly and safely ignore them and route around them with some kind of UASF sooner or later. 
No protocol replacement or hard fork will happen without the community and this doesn't have the community backing, just some 50 people that contributed very little to nothing to Bitcoin in at least a number of years if ever at all - it will just create a new chain and alternative coin.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:36:28
are you part of that agenda? because seems like you can speak freely your bs - bullshit
@_date: 2016-05-17 22:53:40
In this case the way we implemented people can only increase the fee.
In any case, since double spends happen regardless of the opt-in flag, people should wait for a number confirmation related to the amount being moved if they don't trust their counterparty and in some cases even if they trust them (malleability! but luckily segwit will resolve this issue)
@_date: 2015-03-04 07:34:51
This i think can already be done with GreenAddress in part, if you assume the parent has to authorize each payment as the parent can setup email or sms two factor authentication and receive for each payment a request with the BIP70 url requesting it and the amount.
Adding BIP70 whitelisting that bypasses the 2FA should not be hard.
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:44:57
Yep Tor w/ onion address would rock if automated with a qrcode.
@_date: 2015-03-04 08:02:45
GreenAddress has been supporting bip70/payment protocol on all apps since before June 2014 at least.
Adding white listing support per user should not be too hard but I can't give an ETA yet but for now I can say I think it is a good idea and worth adding (it will require 2FA to add to whitelisting if 2FA is enabled)
If the merchants adds an instant request (backwards compatible) to their payment request then GreenAddress will also provide a guarantee of non double spend and enough fees to block confirm in the immediate (since fees are otherwise potentially manual and can be zero and never confirm), see 
@_date: 2015-11-20 10:31:20

You could run BIP148 either in parallel or instead of. In any case once the 91 enforcing kicks in (after grace period) you want to make sure you wait for lots of confirmations or halt activity for a bit.

While we did _some_ work you and Suhas Daftuar and others contributing to bitcoin did what really enabled this now though this is just the beginning, we are likely to see much more in the future (for instance we plan to implement features allowing you to enable automatic bumps by presigning a number of transactions, in case fees go up while you are offline, but also transaction merging if you already have any pending unconfirmed transaction etc)

GreenAddress allows access after a random bip32 key signs, which GA validates via pub key.
If access via Trezor is attempted (in login) with an account that doesn't exist yet GA sends you directly to sign up.
Is possible either this time or the previous time he got the password wrong and didn't realize and then repeated the signup process.
So far we are only guessing because we don't have enough information.
Assuming 2FA was setup and not removed it should be possible to see from settings if this is the actual wallet a new one just created.
@_date: 2016-05-06 23:24:02

Hi bittieBGone,
Sorry for the down time - the service has been resumed.
The reason for the service interruption is still being investigated but from a first look at logs and monitors it seems that our front end run out of resources and crashed overnight (we are in Europe) without auto recovering.
While it's true that during some of the latest stress test we had some service issue we haven't had service interruption in a while and certainly not once a week.
Again, apologises for the service interruption. 
Please allow me to remind everyone that with GreenAddress even if the service is no longer you would still be able to recover your funds via [Gentle]( for your 2of2 wallets (default) or via our [Electrum fork]( for 2of3 subwallets.

diversity of offline nodes? meh
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:14:46
Full nodes in the wild will enforce bip141 if activated (segwit) but indeed they don't know about bip91. Bip91 just activated but the only people running it are the miners and maybe nya signatories and we have no guarantees the miners will all enforce the rules (i.e. signal for segwit &amp; orphan non segwit signaling blocks). 
If they follow through such that 95% of blocks in a period are signaling for segwit then core once activated will start enforcing it.
There are also social pressures at play, the signatories won't like I assume miners to break enforcement for 91 and there is always bip148 at the gate
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:48:34
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:16:10
Not sure what is happening, did you write down all your mnemonics?
You should have seen something like [this]( 
There is indeed an option to reuse the seed already on the Trezor (say done via command line or mytrezor), which is currently the only way to support PIN or password on the Trezor w/ GreenAddress.
We tried to reproduce but in so far our wallets from Trezor seem to work regularly. Can you try again both with the Trezor and directly with the mnemonics or seed?
If you want to provide more private information please contact support directly at info (including the address that received the transaction if possible)
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:03:22
you are right. extension blocks are not bad because of who brought them or implemented them. they are not ideal because of other reasons and I'm ho should only be brought in as a hard fork since they change so much about wallet logic without being entirely opt-in
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:33:31
Not exactly the same, we support the GreenAddress Chrome app or the Firefox website with the Satoshilabs plugin (as well as Android with the GreenBits app).
Older versions of chrome still supporting plugins should work too.
Post signup, In the apps you have to click on Login with Trezor and on the site you have to go to the wallet login page (assuming Firefox).
The sign up can either reuse the seed on the Trezor or create a new mnemonics and write to it, depending on whether you already had an account and whether your Trezor is already initialized.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:42:18
GreenAddress can't just reset 2FA at whim without some other 2FA or with the Google Authenticator seed (which users are advised to store safely too and otherwise have more than one 2FA option).
This is because we can't allow a hacker with part of your data trying to impersonate you to get past the two factor authentication mechanism.
Funds can be recovered via the emailed nlocktime recovery zip and [Gentle]( 
We do try to make Bitcoin safer and more accessible but you have to follow some safety measures like proper backups.
@_date: 2015-10-06 09:15:51
You can also use the 2of3 in GreenAddress which allows you to spend independently  in case of necessity - even if GA is not available.
For 2of2 on the other hand you can use the Gentle Recovery nLockTime function after the multisig 'lock' has expired.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:59:50
Sorry guys but that's not correct.
ABCore (full node for Android) added optional support as it already supported different full node distributions such as Knots
I personally sympathize with UASF in general but I also think bip148 doesn't have strong support (yet) and it is more risky than other options (like BIP149)
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:44:39

Core can't and won't exclude them. They can still contribute code to it. Majority of contributors don't need commit access, only people that do maintenance/merges do. 
The people above stopped contributing a long while back. In case of Hearn he only had a few commits + bitcoinj 
Also keep in mind that when Hearn forked core into XT was because he was trying to offload the heavy lifting to the p2p network for his lighthouse project - and that was rejected from core because the functionality was  buggy and resource hungry and a violation of layers and security. 
That was a very good call especially considering the disaster that lighthouse was.

I don't see why you feel forced by Maxwell contributing as a volunteer to an open source project. I am sure the majority of the contributors would miss his contributions.
You can run whatever software you want, including making your own version of a full node (like BTCD, etc) - or make/apply local changes of your own or others to any of the repos- how can you claim Maxwell stops you in anyway?
It's not up to Maxwell to decide the size of the block or to try to push for a block size change.
This is especially true given he (in my opinion rightly) believes that a block size increase right now only makes sense in the form of improving the efficiency of the system as a whole - i.e. such as segwit, compact blocks, etc
You can't force volunteers to do anything, especially highly controversial things among most of the contributors of the main full node software.
Likewise if the majority of the node and miners don't like segwit it simply won't happen but i think it would be a bummer if the benefits are delayed or even never materialised.

GreenAddress also has 2of3 where you hold 2 keys and one is held by GA for 2FA.

The source of the bitcoin you send is in multisig 2of2 (a channel) with either your counterpart or someone who ultimately has a chain of channels linking you to the counterpart.
You can't open a channel with the same money with n people for the same reason you can't send your bitcoin to two destinations, only one will succeed and get confirmed, the other will fail.

I also think is good this tool is available, so i also thank OP!
For the people thinking this is bad:
This is just a tool, it can be used for testing and other good things and it can be used for bad things (running lots of these to isolate nodes or to spy).
I think it is a good idea to not rely only on random nodes anyhow and have production "external" bitcoin cores also connect to a list of hard-coded nodes (preferably that you personally trust and know) and the data should be authenticated if not encrypted too.
Tools like this one will help people and services understand more about the network and protect themselves more from attacks.

We have made improvements around estimated transaction fees and are working on further making the user experience bette including support for emptying the entire wallet/subaccount.


It can be, especially if you don't spend often enough (as spending resets the nlocktime as you get change back) - if you want to avoid the redepositing you could either extend the lock from 90 days to more (the catch being that you have to wait longer to get the funds back if greenaddress has long term problems) or you could create a 2of3 subaccount (which never requires redeposits but doesn't have instant transactions) 
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:48:14
That's not how it works, you rely on a 2of3 where you have two keys or 2of2 where you have one key but you also have transactions presigned by GreenAddress that allows you to spend them after a predefined amount of time.

Is it really helping? It may help in the sense that it allows to hide behind some network but otherwise it only adds latency so it doesn't really help (unless it caches data) 
@_date: 2016-05-18 00:42:04
no but if you spend an unconfirmed transaction you can easily double spend on your counterpart involuntarily if the parent gets malleated.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:15:43
No, myTrezor and GreenBits look out for different transactions and are setup differently, they don't sync or see each other transactions (they could, but they don't).
I think ideally you wouldn't reuse a seed on different services for different wallets (for privacy reasons) but setting up your Trezor on myTrezor.com or command line will give you more configuration options (like PIN or extra password specific to the Trezor) which you can then use on GreenAddress Chrome App or GreenBits for Android.
@_date: 2015-02-14 14:16:02
I disagree, even if it doesn't throttle it can't improve the speed it can only slow it down and it has to increase the latency.
It's a proxy and since it doesn't cache anything by definition you could go faster/more efficient by going directly bypassing the proxy.
Picture it as a funnel.

You mean self contained as opposed to an app that requires Chrome/Chromium or you meant something else by "normal" app?

Hello I work @ GreenAddress
TL;DR: You can spend the funds even if they doesn't show up in the balance, fix in the works - coming in the next few days.
We indeed know of a [display] bug but are you sure you don't actually have access? 
We are currently fixing a bug related to malleability: the bug doesn't affect your ability to spend funds but in some conditions some malleated transactions show up as double spends and don't count towards the balance shown (but you can spend them anyway!).
From what you say it appears that the transaction you have sent to your GreenAddress wallet was malleated in-flight (as opposed to be an actual double spend sending funds elsewhere instead), which is technically a double spend even though it doesn't actually affect your ability to spend them and even though it wasn't your fault (this was done by a third party in the bitcoin network)
We are working on a fix for the balance which should be ready early next week and a fix for the UX to not show malleated transactions as double spends (everything else being equal) as it unnecessarily scares users.
Apologises for the confusion and for the scary but actually innocuous bug.
Of course if you can't spend the funds then we need to investigate your case specifically as it would then appear to be something different: please email us referencing this post.

[GreenAddress]( supports [nlocktime]( which allows to lock a transaction until a certain point in time or block height in the blockchain. 
We send some presigned nlocktime transaction via emails as a recovery option (encrypted) which could be forwarded to some next of kin who also has the mnemonic passphrase (perhaps encrypted and the password given to another next of kin) but does not have the 2factor authentication needed to make transaction or make settings changes.
If you don't move your money for an X amount of time they would then be able to access your funds.
This solutions assumes some trust with the next of kin, as they would know all your transactions and would be one step verification to take your money so may not be ideal for some situations with different trust but it wouldn't be too hard to cover for those too.
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:40:14
apparently the issue is that someone could encode some illegal data in the blockchain and thus making it illegal in some countries but it has already happened and I don't see Bitcoin being banned because of that. it's a risk but in the grand scheme of things is not a major risk, there's bigger issues imho

To know for sure with any wallet you would have to review the specification, the source and verify that the binaries match the version you have reviewed.
The source code is available on here 
You can build from sources or perhaps use the version from F-Droid which is an open source market for Android apps,

If this mini project is funded the functionality will be added to GreenBits, I think the target amount is 0.5999.

The point is that this way you when you desire GreenAddress can provide guarantees for you that you won't be able to double spend a certain transaction allowing you to transfer bitcoin to any exchange that supports the functionality, currently there's the rock trading exchange and more services are working on adding the support.

Yeah that can work but no guarantees, miners can always include a version with less fee (the transaction you are trying to double spend)

That's user configurable (can set it to 1 year if you are ok with it) and not necessary at all for 2of3 wallets.
Depending on your level of expertise and amount you are hodling there are various solutions for long term storage. I tend to like multisig and hardware wallets - GreenAddress supports some use cases but not all and an expert may want something more sophisticated.
I also quite like the up and coming support for bip32 wallets in the next release of Core :)

GreenBits allows to use a 2of3 subaccount but to create one you need to use the previous app as the functionality has not been reimplemented yet.
Within the previous app you can create a new 2of3 subaccount by providing your own xpub, once you're done with this you can use the subaccount directly from GreenBits.
I hope we'll be able to add subaccount creation in GreenBits in the next few weeks.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:57:00
isn't that the point of a multisig oracle? so it can provide 2FA, limits, etc?

No gaps, yes hd addresses, sequential or separate branches if you create different subaccounts for each incoming transactions

We do plan one; it will be based on a multi platform wallet library (the same we plan to use on Android, iOS and even on the backend)

For the time being you can export derived privkeys by using Electrum from [this branch](  but without code changes looks like you can't export xprivs 
Relatively simple is not there yet, still requires getting an Electrum branch running from GitHub (we don't have binaries) and our plugin didn't make it to the Electrum beta available with binaries. 
We have just rebased and resubmitted the plugin, hopefully it will become easier soon.
@_date: 2015-02-06 11:59:58
Thank you Luke, very good feedback.
From your comment I take the following:


You can change them in send by clicking the "bits" text.
We should make it easier and more obvious as to how one changes the bitcoin denomination (bitcoin, bits, mBTC, uBTC etc), this seems a given.
Besides that, are the denominatin ok or do you feel we should add/rename or even change the default of bits (which seems more popular with new users than with devs)?


This functionality is available on send but not post receiving which we are adding for the next release (and is already available in the previous app).
You can also create subaccounts which are labeled and allow you to avoid merging outputs (but you can only create those from the previous app)


Seems fair. Or maybe a different color of the same icon. Goes from red to green?


We can make it do that, as per the button, I guess you agree it would be nice if one could get a new address without opening and closing the tab, so, maybe a button "New address" instead of the current icon?


You may be able to whitelist our dkim signature but we'll look into what we can do to make this easier.


We can make the warning turn off in settings if that can help.
In terms of a good 2fa on phone it's a good point.
Maybe some paper 2fa or OTP keychain but that doesn't provide transaction information so is not great to blindly authorize transactions.
Ideally you setup 2FA such that you don't have it on your phone and use limits to allow transactions from your mobile 2fa-less under a certain amount. Again this functionality is available only in the previous app but it does work on GreenBits once enabled.


That functionality is in case you lose your mobile device with PIN enabled and want to disable PIN access for the devices such that someone with access to the phone wouldn't even have the 3 attempts they are usually given with the PIN access. And the client is so that you can have multiple read only access but only one that can spend, at least for the time being and you can choose to force logout or not a client.


Agreed. This is something we made sure to avoid in GreenBits and we are going to change in the webapp next.

I couldn't have said it in a better way
@_date: 2016-07-27 22:13:18
Can we discuss this a bit more, and let me know what you think?
I am assuming the delayed withdrawing functionality would still require two factor authentication if enabled and only if not within the limits allowed by the user in fiat or btc (GreenAddress has an opt-in feature to skip 2FA for small amounts you choose)
I'm also assuming the delay is configurable and that you are guaranteed the transaction is not broadcasted to the network until the delay expires (unless cancelled by the user).
I also suppose cancelling wouldn't require 2FA while changing the delay would always require 2FA.
Of course the user can bypass the delay in case of recovery without 2FA if he has access to 2 of the keys in case of the 2of3 or 1 of the keys + nlocktime presigned transactions and the nlocktime expired..
Let me know if I missed something.
I can see how it could be useful in some situations - in general this is payment scheduling which I think can be useful right but with potentially some limits off the top of my head: transaction fee prediction, fiat exchange rate prediction/match (that is - fixing price in fiat as people do even if they pay in bitcoin).
But at least for the first one I have some ideas that can handle the vast majority of situations so I think we will look into this :)
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:48:02
In this case picking the 24 words is quite hard for a human because some words are there for checksum and thus you can't really easily pick the ones you want, not all at least, as per BIP39 specification.

It's a long story but at some point we wanted to investigate how Qt (and QML) works on Android and iOS and while it worked surprisingly well it was relatively slow to code for and was not as bad as HTML5 but was not even close to be as good as a native app and specifically on iOS it had a hard time with the resources available (low ram) so we decided to put the Qt app on hold and go native (and decided to target Android first for its market share).
For desktop a Qt app would probably be better than a HTML5 app but if the actual problem is Google or using Chrome we can package it such that it doesn't require Chrome/Chromium and it would be completely stand alone (and that should get rid of the autoupdate too which is the other problem with Chrome apps).
For iOS I think we'd be looking directly at Swift.
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:23:55
I can vouch to make it happen if it is funded (I'm one of the developers/founders of GreenBits/GreenAddress) but I understand your concerns and agree things should be clearer.
To be honest I wasn't expecting much interest in this but I was prepared to get it implemented if [someone]( decided to go for it and the upside is that I learn more on LightHouse and see how well it works if indeed it gets funded.
By no means I think this is a particular urgent matter, GreenBits has many more things to get right first.

I agree. There are quite a few improvements that can be done without touching the block size that would allow for much better scaling than a brute block expansion would ever do. Schnorr and MAST are great examples and great additions to bitcoin.
When you improve a system you profile things and make the changes that give you the most scalability as needed per change and iterate.
It should go without saying that you should consider all options and prepare a plan and that obviously at each change step you have to test your hypothesis and re-profile the rest and adjust the plan as needed.
I like what I have been seeing from the Core team in the last few years.

you can't force non empty blocks or if you do miners will just add filler transactions they know they wouldn't need to have the previous block validated for
@_date: 2016-07-28 11:41:29


The way I like to solve this is by enabling limits for say $50-100 USD worth of bitcoin and then leave 2FA at home. Someone can force me to spend the 50-100 (or anyhow up to the limit) and then they won't be able to extract anymore without my 2FA.
The drawback is if you actually need more than the limited amount on the go but you can't have your cake and eat it too :(

@_date: 2015-02-05 16:35:46
Correct but we were not talking about the word list itself but the 24 words making the user's seed.
The word list itself while the user can't pass one today there's not reason it couldn't use a different one, perhaps in a different language but even so it would require to have a correct checksum.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:32:56
even if the transaction is given to you before, you have no guarantees thanks to malleability.
Once external malleability is fixed this issue can be solved or alternatively via [CLTV](
edit: Note that you can also avoid the 2of2 and use only the 2of3 subaccounts.

To avoid a split in one case everyone has to upgrade (2x) in the other only the majority of miners have to (148). Sure status quo is the lesser of risks but if I had to pick between 2x and 148 of course I'd go 148
