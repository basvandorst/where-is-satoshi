It is a risk assessment that can be calculated mathematically with a rough model and refined. Just ask one of your bright math people who work with FX hedging.
Your company needs to calculate the total risk exposure to BTC and therefore risk they wish to hold. 
Here's an idea for you to get started. 
Total exposure = N * A, where N = number of returns on average per year and A = amount converted to BTC on average per return.
This calculation can be further refined if you have the data by splitting up the returns rates and average cost per return by product category. ie the return rate and cost of electricals would be a different profile to books.
Total = N1 * A1 + N2 * A2
N1 = Number returns for electrical on average
A1 = Amount value in BTC for returns for electrical on average
N2 = Number returns for books on average
A1 = Amount value in BTC for returns for books on average
When BTC derivatives become more widely available, you will be able to use them to hedge without holding as much BTC reserves. I have seen some derivatives are available but until they are more widely adopted, there is a counterparty risk that they won't pay up.

Counterparty is live and it's working right now! There is already one company who has issued profit shares on Counterparty:
Adam from Lets Talk Bitcoin is thinking about using Counterparty to issue LBT coin:
There is no reason why Mastercoin has a higher market cap than Counterparty.

This is important news. Davis Polk has been involved heavily in regulatory reform for OTC derivates.

I suppose it looks like a copy from the high level feature set. All three are written from completely different code.
The way in which the IPO and the way in which development is taking place is in the same open spirit as Bitcoin. If XCP fails, it will be the failure of the community.

Firstly, if the firmware hasn't been upgraded and you're game, upgrade it and you can get up to 8 GH/s. 
From a pure financial point of view, you're unlikely to get a return on your investment by mining based on current valuations. The prices on ebay would mean you would make an immediate profit.
If you're mining for fun and not fussed about a ROI specifically, then go ahead and join a mining mine some alt coins.

It's down for 72 hours for maintenance.
Pretty bad form that they didn't give anyone notice before performing maintenance. The pools are still working and will pay out after the maintenance period.

Thanks for the tip. To reply to your question, use vlookup.
Assuming you have your table in range A2:G70 of your spreadsheet, use the following formula:
You can substitute the "mtgoxUSD" with any of the values in the first column of the table.

Yes, that's paraphrasing what happens in a speculative bubble.
*In the beginning, attractive fundamentals may drive prices higher, but over time behavioral finance theories suggest that people invest so as to not "miss the boat" on high returns gained by others.*
