Kinda like reading a report by McDonald's on how salads are evil and make you sterile

One thing to consider: it would be fairly hard for him to move them/cash them out/buy something with them without given clues to his identity.
Lets say he decides to buy a Dell laptop, some guy at Dell will have a delivery address tied to that order, whilst he could be sending it as a gift, it would still lead to clues.  One way around this, considering the amount of wealth he potentially has... everytime he buys something buy 10,000 copies of the item to the same random people (picked at random from a phone book or something), although that would still narrow him down to 10,000 people; he would atleast be able to continue to use his Bitcoins.
Personally I don't think somebody who thought through and developed Bitcoin from the amalgamation of technologies as he did would be so frivolous and flippant to throw the keys away and not have all sorts of backups and images of his system(s).

Quite simply, you think wrong.
If I supply company X with stock/inventory and want to be paid in Bitcoins, then I would give company X a payment address unique to that transaction (that I have generated)
Now lets assume, somehow you know Company X's wallet(vault) address somehow, you can look at what's left that address recently, but aside from the fact company X is probably paying a ton of people, there's no way you'd know company X paid me unless you knew the payment address I gave them.

Hey Elum224,
We setup a platform that allows for digital keys to be sent upon Bitcoin transaction completion/game purchasing.   currently use it and seem happy with it.
I've dropped you a PM incase you're interested.

It's easy to look at things in the past as missed opportunities without considering all the 'gambles' and great things you've achieved... eg. your wife/daughter... perhaps if you'd never gambled on chatting up your now wife, you'd not be with her and not have a daughter... maybe if you'd spent an extra 5 minutes in a casino 10 years ago you'd have left and got hit by a car.
It's easy to forget about the good things in life and get bogged down by all the things that in retrospect seem like no brainers.... what if I'd bought Coca Cola shares in the fifties, or invested in Microsoft in the 80s or short sold British Airways Stock before 9/11, so many ifs, buts and maybes... try to focus on the things that matter, living life is much more important than counting it.
