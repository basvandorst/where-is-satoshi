I can definitely confirm that there are not only countless "home Miners" where everyday more and more are getting in business.
But also that there are HUGE international cooperations investing Multi-Billions of USD
and I am not talking about 1-2 ,.. more like 
100-200,...or 1000-2000 Billion USD in Crypto/
When I am writing about 1000-2000 please don't 
take me wrong and think that they BUY for that 
Amount at Bitmain,... NO they build Power Plants 
and Infrastruktur for a very long way to go ahead with - exclusively for Mining.
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:35:03
There are companies investing hundreds of Billions in BTC infrastructure right NOW
Mike who ? 
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:03:59
Everything anyone try to do against it will be for the good :) and will have a positive effect ,..
It's like a prohibition 
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:05:05
Let this ass holes drive the price down ,... 
We can buy it back cheaper.
It’s again the time where all of this payed 
low level unknown people try to make it look like it’s fucking Stock company like Deutschbank.- But after last year -&gt;
Every One wants Bitcoin and bakers are playing 
Yo-Yo As long as possible ,.. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:27:54
Let if fall 
@_date: 2018-12-14 08:41:41
Everybody knows that the market today is TOTALLY controlled by the big banks.
JP, Goldman, Morgen Stanly ,..
That’s FACT !!
They play with it like they want- every day ~
10% Witz up and down, with leverage x10
= 100% per day.
The rest of the traders &amp; new comer are just sheep’s and they are bleeding every day.
I think we will see 1800 for ONE second when it falls from 2300/2500 or 2700. that Incase to have a written ping go keep Mainstream away.
BTC/TRX the future is NoW ! 
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:28:45
Fucking banks bought all up OTC and now the manipulat the price down and up again as long as they have coins to dump it !

@_date: 2018-12-06 00:44:30
I buy more staring 1800 downwards ,...

Yes ! Hire a lawyer in the city of HQ let him write to them. That’s definitely not right what happens to you. Prepair all Documents as much as possible of proof of funds regarding the coins 
prepair the Transactions history and go for it with the lawyer. If that’s correct what you are saying 
I think as soon you come with a lawyer they should be interested to solve the problem quickly incase that crypto is already a special Thema for
prosecutors!
