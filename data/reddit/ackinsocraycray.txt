I'm seriously kicking myself for not investing in this consistently. Last time was 3 years ago, when it was $450+. Back then, I thought that was too much and just spent like $10-$25. Then life happened and I lost track.
I came back and bought a little in September this year and it was over $4k. And now it reached $9k?? Holy crap is all I can say to that.

Yup, same issue here. I'm sort of relieved because I thought my account was compromised or something. I also do the verify by phone call and that seems to work just fine.

If you're going to send BTC from coinbase to another address, there's a transfer fee of 0.05 BTC, so it would be a hassle to make small transfers on a daily basis :/
I just made a paper wallet backup from blockchain and printed another paper wallet through bitaddress.org. I guess my plan is to buy coins through coinbase, transfer most of it to blockchain, then send it to the paper wallet.

Whoops my bad. I think was doing something that prompted me about a transfer fee of 0.005 btc. Disregard!

Has anyone made a paper wallet through Coinbase? It's probably overkill to make a cold wallet for just 0.20-ish BTC but I like the idea of funding it offline. Does this mean I can continue using the same public address to receive BTC and send BTC from Coinbase to my paper wallet?

I'm sort of on the fence with them right now. I was pretty disappointed when they cancelled my order last week, even though I made a really small purchase ($25). I sent an email asking to be whitelisted and I got a response from Olaf a few days later saying that my transactions will no longer be considered high risk. I even got my refund back. I have made another purchase since then and if this gets cancelled, I'll start looking elsewhere.

Thanks for the advice!

Wow, you called it. I just got the email about coinbase cancelling my order, and I only placed it last week. Will try again.

Nice, thanks for the info. I am planning to treat the paper wallet as a savings account and starting another wallet to buy and spend BTC. And since you mention blockchain... I have a deposit address that was set up from the bitcointip bot. Can I start with that?
