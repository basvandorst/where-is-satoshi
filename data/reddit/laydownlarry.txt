How do people protect their investments somewhat soundly in crypto then? I worry I could wake up tomorrow to a major crash. Is putting a stop limit order above the price I paid not a reasonable idea?

That make sense. But wouldn’t it be arguably wise to keep bumping up my limit sell as the price climbs? So even if there is a flash crash and it sells, I could still conservatively make a profit and avoid a larger crash.
I guess my big question is, how else do people sleep at night having money in a 24/7 hyper-volatile market? I worry I could wake up to a $2,000 btc tomorrow.

3 years and 9 months on reddit and you're the first to know that

Yeah I don't have any friends who use BTC that I know of. I was hoping to find someone on reddit as that would feel better than craigslist.
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:30:58
yeah! send me what I need to know.

All that? What like 10 minutes of work to make $50?
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:45:14
Ah got it. Thank you!
Since BTC is so volatile, are there any exchanges that offer stop loss? Seems like it would be great to have. How do people avoid massive drops in price, other than just keeping a close watch on the price?

Anyone know if this will offer stop loss?

RemindMe! 1 year "Does ₿ look like a bitcoin symbol yet?"

Wait but the market price is currently around $400, so why would a limit sell for $300 file right now if "limit is the buy/sell price you want if the market price hits it."??

Also, eBay would still be asking for a 10% cut from sellers. Big difference right there.
