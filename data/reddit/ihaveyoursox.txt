Wellll i guess i should have foreseen the hate....to be honest its not necessarily interesting to me what happens with trump, whether he is innocent or guilty is inconsequential to me. If i wanted a political debate i would have gone to r/politics or r/Donald to be 100% honest all i am interested in is what this means for the price of BTC.

So if Trump does end up getting impeached and removed what do you guys think that would do to the price of BTC? Generally we have seen uncertainty raises the price of BTC but seening that the U.S. is such a superpower do you think it would work in the same way as the past? And i guess its a two part of impeachment and removal.

Looks like its fighting 6xxx. In my not so professional opinion as soon as it gets under that we will have a mini free fall to about 6600. But only time will tell.
