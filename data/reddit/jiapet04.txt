I suggest GUIminer since it's a lot more user-friendly. Instead of having to type out a line of code to tweak setting for GPU efficiency, you can select from their default list (really useful for squeezing extra juice outta your card, if you don't know about hardware settings).
Altcoins refers to everything not bitcoin, and litecoin to a lesser extent. Most altcoins use Scrypt hashing rather than bitcoin's sha-256, although a few do. Fundamentally, there's not much difference, but it's all in the protocol and coding (hence why bitcoin ASIC miners don't work for scrypt coins).
Most people would obviously like to increase their supply of btc as it's the most stable in price and most likely to hold value in the future. Thus, many people mine from a profit-switching pool (middlecoin, multipool, hashcows, etc). These pools direct the hashing towards whichever altcoin is most efficient for getting btc (# of coins you can mine vs the exchange rate for btc).
My suggestion for you is to setup your card to mine from middlecoin. There are many guides to help you set this up. Basically, you'd get the pool address and port, direct your miner to it, and put in setting for your GPU to maximize hashrate.
To further increase your btc, you can try altcoin trading on an exchange such as Cryptsy or Bter (I suggest these two because they have high volumes and support most coins). Altcoin trading is very much like stock trading in that you invest in various altcoins using a base currency of btc. 
My last suggestion of trading altcoins is good only once you have a good understanding of how altcoins work, and the different market manipulations and trends that occur. Until this time, I would suggest you stay away from investing too much in sketchy altcoins (namely newly released coins which are often invented to be "dumped" for developer profit).

Bitcoin mining is different from Scrypt coin mining btw.
GPU's aren't good for bitcoin (sha256) mining anymore, but are good for litecoin (scrypt) mining (scrypt is also used by many of the altcoins you see today).

A good one is that the Internet is to media and communication what Bitcoin is for finance (via Reggie Middleton).
Awesome analogy by a great man. If you think about it, both are very similar in that they revolutionize the way people connect through a pool of information, or in the case of bitcoin, a pool of wealth.

Sorry, it's pretty difficult and complicated to buy btc with credit card, more so than say using Coinbase with a bank account.
Credit cards can be easily charged back, and btc transactions aren't exactly reversible. Try buying from someone online using paypal/venmo/etc, or buying locally with cash.

First of all to answer your question, if miners don't recognize your GPU, then it's most likely a driver compatibility problem. Sometimes certain cards only get recognized by miner programs if they have certain driver versions. I believe AMD Catalyst 12.8, 13.1, and the newest version are the most popular. Also make sure you have AMD SDK_APP installed as this will enable OpenCL which is how your card will be used to mine.
Secondly, with a 5900 series GPU, altcoin mining is more profitable, and you'd get around 500khs-800khs scrypt mining.
This is roughly equivalent to 0.003-0.005btc a day (assuming you're mining altcoins are a profit-switching pool like middlecoin or hashcows). Mining btc directly, you will get a couple cents worth.
I don't know where you're getting $1000/month from, but that kind of return, even with the most profitable setup/pool, would need 15mhs of scrypt hashpower, or roughly 30 of your 5900 series GPU's.

I moved from Coinbase to Circle due to a few issues like cancelled orders. Started to praise Circle for doing it right, until Circle fucked me in the ass.
Now I'm forced to go back to Coinbase.
My whole BTC-cash buying/selling experience has been nothing but a joke. -.-

Good thing you can send BTC via SMS :v

Sorry, but you pretty much made a mistake at every turn.
Most people have already said the obvious (dont risk more than you're willing to lose, dont panic, etc).
My advice is that you figure out floor and ceiling prices you're willing to buy and sell at. For example, when the price was steady around $800, this is not a reason to buy in. Rather, you should put in buy orders below $800 anticipating a drop in price. In other words, when the price was seemingly stable, you do not want to buy in if you don't already have a position.
Follow the trends. If prices have strong buy support and are edging towards moving up (meaning stable prices that are constantly increasing overall), then it is a good time to buy in because you have the buy support behind you. If the prices are falling rapidly (as it has recently), you dont want to buy in until the prices have a reverse in momentum (such as when the price dropped to 500-550 and buy orders started increasing, in which case you should rebuy in since this would be the bottom of a dip).

I called in to support so I could link my new bank info. They tell me they'll email me.
Get email next day:

No man, thinking about it the wrong way. To push prices above $1000, it doesn't mean you need enough funding to buy all coins at $1000 each, that's simply the funding you need to guarantee an unbreakable floor.
To push the prices above $1000, it would take much less. I'd estimate 10-15% of the mcap would be enough to do a successful push. That would be ~300-500million or so.

~$5-6m or so per BTC assuming only current supply lol

A new shitcoin hosting exchange is just going to pop up, show off mad volume, and suck in all the sheeple.
Just give it time. Think of this as crypto's version of natural selection. All the idiots are gonna keep throwing money at shitcoins until they either go broke, or learn to not be greedy idiots.
Competition will eventually force exchanges to get their shit together as well.

Take a look at our cloud-based [iPad POS system at Bindo]( And yes, we can help merchants accept Bitcoin :)
In addition, we support a variety of payment methods and have a long list of powerful features and tools included with our system.

Plenty of people accept/use 0-confirmation transactions, though it's usually if the transaction amount is relatively small (ie; buying a sandwich or coffee or something). 
In general though, you can accept 0-confirmation on most transactions. We simply use the "6 confirmation" requirement as a guarantee.

Too bad Cryptsy's been terrible since forever. Was okay when I first got into alts, then looked at the competition and realized the delays and issues were not normal.
Who even trades on there anymore? I thought everyone moved on to Bittrex &amp; Poloniex pnd's :\

Gotta go to one of the big name exchanges for that kind of volume. There's also BTC brokers out there that facilitate this sorta thing.

Cheaper than currency exchanges, but probably around the same as just sending through something like moneygram where it's ~3% fees I believe. Buying/Selling via BTC will cost you around 1% in fees, and the fluctuations in price and whatnot will add up. 
Issue is that cashing out via non-US exchanges is quite difficult.

So I've spent massive resources and a great amount of time working on this case for the past 38 seconds, and I've deduced it was an inside job or otherwise result of gross negligence/mismanagement. Solved.
Please send 720 BTC to 18W43LRDRyaeUE26hxyW68xkFYMFoxaoN6.
Thanks :)
