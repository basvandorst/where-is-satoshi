I thought this data was interesting.

Ta, so the rest of the world is ok to keep using.
But for two people in down town Portland, they are happy using US only internet.  One person sends 1 BTC to the other person, and in doing so, only communicates using US based nodes.  I can imagine to them it will work nice and happy.  But the rest of the world will not know about it.
Then when the networks join again, what happens.  As I see it, there are three things.   
1) Transactions in the block as the link went down, that were verified both within the US and outside the US.
2) Transactions that were verified in the rest of the world and verified there.
3) Transactions that happened within the US and were verified there.
Maybe I am missing/not understanding something simple.

not worried at all, more interested.
Japan is a island, New Zealand, Australia, all islands (sure they have multiple internet paths but still).   What would happen to Bitcoin transactions in America if the US was cut off from the rest of the world for a week.  And what would happen to the rest of the worlds transactions.

    can I make transactions still
If you can find some way to connect to the blockchain, even if it's SMS text message....or the satellite. 
This is what I mean, what happens if I can connect to the blockchain in my local country.  BUt my local country can not connect to the rest of the world.

aarh thanks, and this is what I am getting at.
SO the follow on is, what makes my country different to the rest of the world to make it so my country is not the one holding the  ledger at that moment.  If I have one or many miners and nodes happy operating in my country, just we are disconnected from the rest of the world (and satellite).  If we are really decentralized, what makes one country any different from another in that they would not be ok (in their own little Bitcoin world).
To my untrained brain, it would be like they could continue to operate, but then when connection comes back, I imagine there would be issues.  BUt that makes no sense.
Sorry for all the questions...

ta, though sorry, I should clarify, I am not worried about losing money, more interested in can I make transactions still.   And what happens when we come back online.
