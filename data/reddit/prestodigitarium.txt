Thanks for running through the numbers. So it's still more than my household uses in a month for everything else it does. I think we should probably not celebrate growth in the hash rate for it's own sake, because it represents a titanic waste of energy.

I didn't clearly express what I meant. I meant what's the equivalent in terms of what provides fundamental value to a bitcoin. With a share of stock, it's that if it becomes too cheap, people can buy control of a real company, which gives them power. For bitcoin, the equivalent just seems to be belief in its current and future value, full stop.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:16:16
So you're saying that the fundamental value underpinning is that owning a bitcoin somehow grants you a share of the value of the total payment network?

Who in this scenario is going to be willing to cash out everyone's bitcoins at $115k, each, exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:48:36
Except this happens regularly for companies, when they get bought, and the purchaser bids higher than the market price for every share outstanding. And in Amazon's case specifically, each of those shares entitles you to a share of control and of the assets in one if the world's most powerful companies. If someone wants to take over that company, they have to buy a majority of the shares.
What's the equivalent for a Bitcoin?

What does that convert to in terms of kilowatt-hours/transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:56:03
Obviously. I mean what's the equivalent fundamental underpinning of value for a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:46:36
I agree. Unfortunately, I think the majority of users currently are people who think that, and I don't think that the transition will be so smooth.

Ponzi schemes work wonderfully until you run out of people to add to the base of the pyramid. The people currently adding themselves to the base of the BTC pyramid are mainly doing so because they see the price of BTC going up rapidly. What do you think will happen when there aren't any more people who want to join in?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:01:22
Sure, not all people using BTC are doing so to speculate on prices, but the people who need to use it because their local currency is collapsing aren't typically the ones with enough resources to cash out any significant number of people who want to sell at $19k/BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:54:58
What is your source on that? The limit is not all humans, it's all humans with the resources to pump into BTC and the willingness to do it.

Specifically, it's a government issued currency that isn't backed by a physical commodity. The US Dollar was backed by a set amount of gold until the dissolution of the Bretton Woods system in the early 70s, at which point the USD became a fiat currency.

The peak isn't at 50% of all people. It's limited to the population that can afford to pump money into this and are willing to speculate on rising prices.

I agree with you. But people tend to have a hard time agreeing with something that is very strongly not in their financial best interest to agree with.
It needs to become much more user friendly than it is if it's going to become as mainstream as everyone here seems to think it will be. The internet didn't become more than a niche curiosity until the www came on the scene, making it much more accessible (and useful) to normal people.

There's a huge conflict of interest in that structure, because there's a large incentive to wave people through, lest you kill your business by being too hard to pass. It's similar to having gun stores administer firearm safety tests, or having Moody's paid by the banks whose securities they're supposed to be rating.
Besides that, though, it's not just a test of sophistication, but whether you're able to make big enough investments to make the substantial amount of due diligence (and potentially legal fees) worth it for both the investors and the company. You need to be able to talk to the company to do proper due diligence, because startups have extremely high variance compared to public companies. And it's not worth a company's time to talk to you for less than a $20,000 check.
EDIT: That said, if you want to get around the child safety locks by just claiming you're an accredited investor, no one is going to verify or prosecute you for it. But don't expect to be able to claim you were misled, etc. if you get screwed.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:16:27
Fair, you could structure some test to avoid the conflicts of interest.
But you can't just hire a lawyer/broker/etc to go do your due diligence on startups for you - it's not legal due diligence, it's everything you need to figure out to make an investment decision. You would essentially need to hire an investor, and the way you do that is by joining a fund. 
Most existing funds have minimums of 250k-$1M and up. Your best bet would be to join a smaller fund like one on AngelList, and essentially hire someone well connected to invest in startups for you. You'll pay a lot for the privilege (the typical fees are 20% of all profits), but I think some of the funds have minimums as low as $25k. Not sure if they've opened up to non-accredited investors yet. 
If you wanted to make a real go at investing in individual startups, and not have a very high chance of getting eaten alive, you should be willing to invest in at least 20. The minimum check size to make it worth a startup's time to talk to you is ~$25k. So you should be willing to budget $500k for this. I'd hope you're wealthy enough to be considered an an accredited investor if you're willing to put that much into an asset class as risky as startups.
Yeah, it's not a great idea to claim to be accredited if you're not. I'm just saying that the only person you'd hurt is yourself.

They're not outdated unless human nature has changed. Last time I checked, it hasn't.

Personally, I'm just here because I find it interesting/educational to watch how mass delusion starts, explodes, and then responds to reality setting in as values come back to earth. Maybe it'll help me spot other bubbles in the future. I'm guessing most of the "trolls" are in the same boat, or are just trying to help people not lose significant money by talking some sense into people.
But as always with bubbles, who really knows if it's a bubble? I don't.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:28:16
I'm not the person you replied to earlier in this thread, just a bystander.

This isn't some conspiracy, it's for your protection as an investor, because it's easy to fool yourself into thinking it's a good way to get rich quick. In an unregulated market, people start coming out and making outlandish claims about how an investment is going to grow, and people start buying in like crazy, and then losing their money en masse. You can see this happening with a lot of ICOs right now. Stock markets used to look more like that, and a lot of people lost money they couldn't afford to lose.
In order to gauge whether a startup investment is a good one (and not a complete fraud), you have to meet with the team and grill them, and ideally vet their product. Financials are completely unaudited. It's a totally different ballgame from investing in public companies. 
Also, there are limits to the number of investors a company can have before it has to go public, with all of the headaches that involves. Those regulations could be loosened, though.

It's not "victim blaming", it's just being a responsible adult. You're responsible for your own well being, so you should hire a lawyer to help you review important decisions. 
And they generally didn't "make money from their customers' losses". Many of them went bankrupt. This wasn't something they we're aiming for, they weren't suicidal.

You know it's entirely your responsibility to actually read and understand contracts that bind you for the next 30 years before signing them, right?

You can always add silver coins to that setup to get smaller denominations.
