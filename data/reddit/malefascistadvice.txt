No, it's not Zimbabwecoin, but it's hardly insignificant either.  Picture 20 years hence, and suppose, just suppose, that the dominant cryptocurrency is the new gold, with a market cap of $10 trillion.  If it's bitcoin, then the annual inflation rate will be just under 0.2%, or $20 billion.  If it's dogecoin, then the annual inflation rate will still be 2.5%, or *$250 billion*.
And these coins don't just appear out of nowhere, they are *mined*.  With $250 billion up for grabs, it means that the resources (ASIC's, electricity etc) poured into mining dogecoin as opposed to bitcoin would be an order of magnitude greater.  
I'm no libertarian fundamentalist, and I don't have an ideological thing against inflationary currency as such - I'd be quite comfortable with, say, a demurrage system, as with Freicoin.  But the environmentally destructive process of mining is something I feel should be minimised.  Sure, we need enough miners to secure the network, but any more than that is just utterly wasteful.

Furthermore, atmospheric CO2 is just one concern.  [Melting permafrost produces methane,]( which is a far more powerful greenhouse gas.  And [when CO2 is dissolved into the oceans, it results in acidification,]( which is devastating for marine life.

Here's an idea - micro-crowdfunding.  Allow people to pledge tips toward a fund that will only be deducted when the tips are sufficient to reach the goal.  So if there is a need for, say, $20 for some reason, people could pledge tips a few cents or a few dollars, and when they add up to $20, the tips go through.  But if the goal isn't reached, they keep their tips.
Perhaps it could even be used to send people things (say ordering someone a pizza) by doing the microcrowdfunding on the Changetip system, and when the goal is reached, it gets sent to the blockchain and it orders the purchase.

Yeah, I think the ideal option is the 'stock split', where 1,000,000 new bitcoins = 1 old bitcoin.  It eliminates any possible confusion re bits vs bitcoins vs the unit of data bit, and stops bitcoins from looking 'expensive' to the general public who won't be aware of Bitcoin's divisibility.  
But failing that, I believe using millionths (whatever we choose to call them) as the most commonly used unit is particularly important for further adoption.  And as you suggest, perhaps we can do the stock split later.

Heh, no problem, it's worth discussing these things and rigorously nutting them out, and advocacy for the Devil is needed.
Bits may not be the ideal solution in all respects, but maybe it's the optimal one.  It's a term that's gaining recognition quickly, which is vital for the growth of bitcoin.  All too many people don't realise that bitcoins are divisible, so they think of the price as "too expensive".  So bits, at thousands to the dollar, are far more accessible.  They feel 'fun', like Dogecoin, which are at a similar price level.
Though the double meaning of 'bit' is somewhat annoying, I don't think the unit confusion will be much of a problem as people aren't computers and have little difficulty with context.  However, if there is any confusion in Bitcoin IT circles, where the two terms will be used together frequently, they might adopt professional jargon and refer to bitcoin bits as microbits (or perhaps just 'mikes') to eliminate the ambiguity.

Show me where I supported minimum wage laws for employment.  I only advocated a UBI.  However, I support minimum wage laws and unemployment benefits until a UBI is implemented.


Have you ever heard the expression "Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life"?


People who do what they love reduce uneasiness by finding fulfilment in what they do (thereby reducing their uneasiness caused by their lack of fulfilment).  And this can involve a great deal of productive activity.


I've done that - it gets pretty old after a few weeks.


Your tolerance to alcohol would soon skyrocket, and the UBI wouldn't cover the ongoing expense of your alcoholism.


Depends on who you are.  Some people find certain work less unpleasant than others do.  Or they might even *enjoy* it.


If you can't find someone on the UBI willing to do it for $6 an hour, then you'll have to do it yourself.  Mind you, soon enough, such maintenance jobs will be most likely done by robots.  Indeed, even the need to own a car will be an anachronism, as we'll be serviced by fleets of cheap, driverless taxis.

Thanks very much for the tip. :)
I have no ideas for the cause, but my idea for Changetip micro-crowdfunding wasn't really about doing big stuff, so much as small favours for people.  For example, buying pizza for some open source developers of Bitcoin - assuming we know what address they'll be at.  
Because Changetip's niche is in microtransactions, I'm guessing it should be possible for, say, a few dozen people to toss in a few hundred or a few thousand bits each to pay for an online order for something.  So it would keep it all within the Changetip system, and then if the goal (including Changetip withdrawal fee) is reached in time, the order would be placed and payment forwarded to the on-blockchain address. If the goal isn't reached in time, it gets returned to the tippers.I don't know what kind of software would be needed for such a system, but that's not my speciality.
Of course, I'd say people would come up with all sorts of uses for such micro-crowdfunding that would never occur to you or me.  I'm just offering the suggestion of the basic concept.

@_date: 2014-09-03 03:14:52




You're digging pretty hard there.  I agree that it's a problematic system, but it's the lesser evil than expecting people to survive on less than your $2 an hour or whatever.  So that's why I advocate the UBI.


And people wouldn't do such jobs for free.  That is, if automation doesn't take over such tasks.


Have you heard of volunteerism?  Internships?  But most people *would* still get paid for their work, and most people *would* still go to work, because they wouldn't want to live solely off the UBI.


On the UBI alone, it would allow for a very limited form of that.


Again, it would mean giving them a very limited existence if you relied simply on the UBI.


This technology is growing rapidly, and getting cheaper and more capable all the time.  And it's not just manual labour that's being automated, but increasingly, highly-skilled knowledge work as well.  Even the work done by such professionals as doctors and lawyers.  The middle class, who do the vast majority of this knowledge work, is being drained.  This isn't theory, it's fact.


By giving people money for nothing, two things will happen:


Which people doing nothing?  As I said, most people will continue to work, at least until automation covers it.


Which will encourage more people to provide such goods and services.


And the subsidy of the poor will provide more economic activity, ie more business and work.


It subsidises both doing nothing and doing *anything*.  *Everyone* is subsidised.

You can't do takeover bids with bitcoin.  You can no more buy up all the bitcoin than buy up all the gold in the world.  Try to do that, and you just send the price of bitcoin soaring.  And if they just sit on a hoard of bitcoin, their share in the system will gradually diminish.
And you may be right about the communism thing.  If Bitcoin doesn't work, and just causes trouble in the world, then we'll have to come up with something better.  But at least by then, people will have been forced to think long and hard about the nature of money and economy, and about what kind of system would actually work well.

Well, let's suppose, for simplicity's sake, that you've got a state with a hundred million voters.  Each one gets 100 votes a week, and votes are taxed at 1% a week.  This would require one trillion votes in the system, or an average of 10,000 per voter, to provide everyone with 100 votes per week.  Anyone who doesn't use their votes would eventually end up with (almost) 10,000, but they could never accumulate more than that, unless they received them from others.
The purpose of anonymising the transactions for the recipients would be so that votes wouldn't get sold or demanded from anyone, since that would simply turn it into a conventional currency, and make the system farcical.  And they could come in staggered, random instalments over a period of time, to obscure things even further.  
Indeed even *sending* the votes could be required to be staggered in a similar fashion - ie your voting software might request you several times over a period of a couple of weeks to confirm each new partial amount (say 25 votes, then 13 votes, then 34 votes, then 28 votes on the following Monday, Thursday, Tuesday week, and then Wednesday week, to deliver the full 100).  Hopefully this would make corruption of the system difficult.

Chances are, you're not going to lose your bitcoin in a hot wallet.  I've had a small amount in a hot wallet in Electrum for over a year now and it's still there.  But the fact is, it's not 100% secure, as hot wallets *have* been stolen from, and if someone *does* manage to take it, you have no way of retrieving it.  
You wouldn't walk around a city with tens of thousands of dollars in cash on your person, in case you get mugged or lose it, and using a hot wallet is rather similar to this for bitcoin.

You *can't* disregard the network effect.  Regardless of what the price is, the network *won't* get smaller.  The people who understand how to use Bitcoin aren't suddenly going to stop knowing how to use it.  Unless they die, but I think it's pretty safe to say that they're reproducing at a much faster rate than they're expiring.  And no, there aren't any substitutes - Bitcoin has *by far* the largest network for a cryptocurrency, and it would be a tough job indeed to supplant it.

It won't be immediately apparent to newcomers, but your bitcoin is *not* stored in your wallet, whether it be an electronic one or a paper one.  It is stored on the *blockchain*, the globally distributed, encoded ledger that holds all the information about all the bitcoin, and what addresses hold them.  
Your wallet is essentially just a list of long, complicated passwords (each made up of 30-odd letters and numbers) that gives you access to the bitcoin contained in a bunch of addresses.  And it doesn't matter how you store those passwords, as long as you and no-one else but you has access to them.

Furthermore, Arabic uses million just as the West does.  And while I'm not sure about local Afrcian languages, European languages are used in much of Africa, so they shouldn't have trouble with it either.
And people everywhere (except all too many in the US) are familiar with SI units, so powers of 1000 aren't unfamiliar to them.  Besides, the Western world is still very much dominant economically (like it or not) and it would be better for Bitcoin adoption to accommodate its habits.


No, just my non-Japanese bias.  Mind you, for somewhat similar reasons, I think 'microbit' is also too clunky and alienating.  But as I said, satoshi is too small in value to use, certainly at this point at least.  And anyway, I think the horse has more-or-less bolted, so debating whether to shut the gate now is rather futile.

Unfortunately, the term 'religion' in the West has been poisoned by dogmatic, exclusivist Abrahamic forms, and mentioning the word causes all too many eyes to glare, spines to stiffen, and anuses to pucker.  
But I'm referring to esoteric forms, which are concerned with direct experience of non-duality, of ego-loss.  While there may be structures of practices and other methods developed to help you get there (as with yoga, Buddhism, Taoism, psychedelics), ultimately it's not about following rules, but about transcending them.

Changetip is great for tips that are less than a hundred times the miner's fee, as it means that people can accumulate lots of small tips and then withdraw all at once, costing just the 1% plus one miner's fee charge.  For tips of higher value than a hundred times the miner's fee, Changetip is *more* expensive than doing it on the blockchain.  There should be another tipping service for high-value tips, as Changetip is all about microtransactions.

Slavery was an engine of the economy until the 19th Century, but it doesn't mean it shouldn't have been abolished.  Indeed, it actually wasn't quite - the servitude of the indebted took over.  
But the world economy is changing at a blisteringly fast pace, and all too soon, with the advance of automation, the current concept of 'workers' may soon be an anachronism.  The system is going to have to be reengineered in ways we haven't dreamed of to prevent the world from falling into chaos and conflict, and the class that feeds off the current financial system are rent-seeking parasites and cause massive inefficiency.  Time for that part of the economy to be disrupted.
@_date: 2014-12-21 07:11:57


Banks are what is my biggest gripe - they're basically legalised crime syndicates.  Indeed that's how they started their fractional reserve racket all those centuries ago, by committing crime, before they got too powerful to be shut down.  And so they continue to privatise their profits and socialise their losses.
And there's been deflation in the hi-tech sector for decades, and that hasn't harmed its economy.  The price of computer power has halved every 18-24 months, but it doesn't stop people buying computers.
Deflation may be devastating to a debt-based economy, but bitcoin isn't a debt-based economy, and it's far from clear that it would suffer similar problems.

Bitcoin has made a habit of adopting the stronger qualities of the more notable altcoins.   What Dogecoin showed was that tipping could be popular with a unit of very small value.  The term 'bit' is taking hold, and it's a unit in the same order of magnitude in value to the dogecoin, and so it makes it more 'fun' to throw around, in a way that tipping, say, 0.00173 BTC wasn't. 
Furthermore, Changetip is (as I understand it) doing things off the blockchain, and while they will  charge a 1% fee for withdrawals to external wallets (starting next year), no fees are charged while your bits remain *within* the Changetip system.  This allows for cheap microtransactions.  And of course, Changetip is functioning on several big sites, and I expect it to expand even further.

But I think the bit would be the best denomination to use, as it's simple, so people can learn it easily.  And a millionth is a nice round number.
They are still much less than a cent each, which means decimals don't have to be used.  And even if Bitcoin grows to the point where the bit passes the value of the cent and approaches the value of the dollar, we can use two decimal places for satoshis - people are used to seeing two decimal places on price tags, and the satoshi would be essentially the cent of the bit.  People might even just call them bitcents, as satoshi is a bit long and not obviously related to Bitcoin.

Excellent stuff.  This is what Bitcoin remittence needs to be - a service at *both* ends, so the sender doesn't have to understand Bitcoin.  The typical low-income foreign worker isn't likely to get their heads around Bitcoin in a hurry, so they need the service to take care of that part.  
Bitspark should get a massive amount of business.  Especially if it can remit fast enough for the workers to get notice of the delivery while they wait.  I'm most impressed that they can do it for less than 1%.  I just hope the Philippines has enough demand to be able to handle the influx of Bitcoin that needs to be sold there.

Yeah, no-one wants to use 'satoshi' as a currency.  It's a weird Japanese word unconnected to Bitcoin in any way that's obvious to the uninformed, and 100,000,000 isn't a nice round number in the way 1,000,000 is.  Also, the value of a satoshi is going to be tiny for a long while yet, whereas the bit is only an order of magnitude below the US cent.

It is if you think bitcoin is too expensive. Or if you want people to spend it.




The whole point of smaller denominations is so we don't have to mess with all those decimal places.  But the millibit is quite likely to be well over a dollar very soon, and it may not be long before it's North of $10 - whereupon small transactions are going to be hampered by those excessive decimal places again.  So I'm hoping the millibit phase will be a brief one.  And if we drop the use of the millibit altogether, there shouldn't be confusion with the microbit.


Possibly, but 'bitcoin' itself could be this verb. (And 'zee-ing isn't likely to take off outside North America, because 'zed'.)


OK, but colloquialisms like these don't tend to emerge just by someone announcing that it's the term we should use.  So don't get too attached to 'zib', as it's not likely to take off.  But hey, you never know.

'Xibs' is ridiculous because how it's pronounced isn't readily apparent, and so is quite alienating.  'Zibs' is better, but its connection to bitcoin still isn't obvious.  We need a term that is easily adopted by laypeople, and 'bits' is already a colloquial term for units of currency. It's easy, catchy, and 'fun', and its connection to Bitcoin is pretty clear.


The only people who could possibly confuse Bitcoin bits with CS bits are IT types, and they're technical enough to understand the difference - CS bits are rarely discussed by laypeople.  
Perhaps IT will adopt a separate jargon for when the two could become confused ('mikes', perhaps).  But the pound, the unit of currency, and the pound, the unit of weight, have been used for centuries and it doesn't seemed to have cause much of a problem.  Besides, most CS uses of bits is in written, rather than spoken form, so the two senses of 'bits' would get about as confusing as '£' vs 'lb'.

They're clunky because if the price of Bitcoin grows to new all time highs, the mBTC will again be more valuable than the dollar.  And then there will be all those decimal places to contend with.  Much better to go for millionths than thousandths.  And they're alienating because they have too many syllables for a currency.  Much better to have a one-or two syllable word for common use.  Remember, these need to be used by regular people, not just nerds.

And even those who don't, most of them will engage in other productive activity even if they receive no remuneration, because they gain fulfilment from it.  Just because someone isn't willing to pay you for what you do doesn't mean it's worthless.


I'm suggesting that if there is a UBI, there will be no need for a minimum wage.  People could work for that $2 an hour if they felt like it, or 50c an hour, or as I said, even for free.  But if you want employees to do unpleasant work, you'll have to pay them enough to give them the incentive to do so, rather than feeding off their despair.

I don't see how.  They can't take anyone to the cleaners for unpaid debts. 


As long as you don't sell out a controlling share of your venture, you remain in control.  And you might wish to nut out a deal where if you end up a wild success you would be given the option to buy them out.  For a larger stake of the rewards before you reach that threshold, of course.  But the good thing about VC's is that they're in the same boat you are, and it's very much in their interests for you to do well.  That way they can act more as a mentor than a master, as I still retain the view that debt is slavery.


And my respect for classical economics is very limited, as I've indicated.  There's been way too much political and financial interference in the world of economics, which has severely tainted its credibility.  Too much shilling of viewpoints approved by the overlords.

You could link, but I'd suggest you start new threads and explain your experience (and the process) in full - it'll get more attention and generate more discussion (of course, you can add a link to this post in the message body, as well).  
Mind you, they're only very small subs, so that could just be the difference between no comments at all, and a couple of comments.  Still, for everyone who posts, you're likely to get fifty more who read your threads.  And from small things, big things grow, so you'll be doing both the Kenyans and Bitcoin a service.  
There's actually a couple of posts about the BitPesa launch on already (one of them mine), and another one on but no actual user reports so far.  But definitely post new threads rather than adding to the current ones, since they're a couple of days old and won't get attention.

An idea I've had is that everyone would receive votecoin (or bitvote, as I had called it) on a constant basis, in equal quantity - say a hundred vote points a week.  Yeah, people could give them to each other, and instead of having designated, registered politicians, *everyone* would be able receive votes, and so act as proxies for one another.  
However, transactions would be entirely anonymous, so that the recipient wouldn't know where they were getting their votes from.  This would prevent it from becoming simply another currency, so you couldn't just buy stuff with it, or demand them from others.  A degree of vote fuzzing and random delay of transactions could make the sources even more uncertain.
People could also stockpile their votes, but they would be 'taxed' at a steady rate (say, 1% per week). In other words, if you don't use them, you lose them (eventually), and the taxed votes would be redistributed to everyone else through their vote income.  And maybe there could be coloured votes, which could only be used for certain purposes, depending on the particular expertise of your proxies.  So you could, say, give an education vote to someone whose views on education you respect, and they could 'spend' it on matters concerning schools, colleges, universities and other forms of training, but they wouldn't be able to use it for cases regarding the building of transport infrastructure, like roads and railways.
Of course, I'm just brainstorming here, and there would be a lot to work through to get such a system properly functional.

@_date: 2014-04-03 14:41:07
Yeah, this is the kind of limiting factor I'm talking about.  However, I'm not saying that the rate we've been climbing for the last couple of year and a bit has been the true one.  I don't write off the possibility of a super-crash sometime in the next couple of years, after years of massive growth.  
Bitcoin might lose 90-95% of its value, before returning to perhaps 25% of whatever all-time-high it drops from.  This would take a long time to recover from, perhaps 2 years.  But then Bitcoin would continue on its climb at a slower, but still exponential rate. So a  super-sized version of the kinds of rallies and crashes we've had for the last couple of years.
But hey, maybe we really are climbing at the actual rate.  Maybe we'll reach $100,000 by 2016.  Or maybe something unforseen will kill it.  Whatever happens, I'm in for the ride.

Words can have multiple meanings in different contexts.  And even if the term 'bit' was first suggested in Bitcointalk, it's taken a long time to become accepted by the Bitcoin community in general.  There's no 'agreeing to' it, as it's just a meme (in the original, broader sense, as coined by Richard Dawkins some 40 years ago) .  It either takes off, or it doesn't - and it sure seems like it *has* taken off.
I understand that it's not a 100% satisfactory term, but to the average person, it's short and catchy, and is already a colloquial word for units of currency.  I'm just glad that an easy, common term for the microbitcoin has taken hold, because I believe those ridiculous strings of decimal places were really holding things back - they were both confusing and psychologically deflating.  No-one wants to own "zero point zero three zero nine two" of a unit of currency.

It's just that I've been a bit concerned with many Bitcoin startups, who may be excellent on the technical side, but are all too often sorely inadequate on the marketing side.  So I'm just hoping you've got that side of things well covered, to get your message across to your potential customers.

Cold storage is where you store your bitcoin in a cold (or offline) wallet - that is, using addresses generated on a system that doesn't touch the internet.  This way, hackers have no way of accessing your private keys and stealing your bitcoin.  Highly recommended for large bitcoin stashes.

The current Bitcoin community has enough inertia to make it very tough to abandon the convention of bits, even at this early stage.  And I think as time goes on, people will talk more and more in terms of bits for day-to-day use - maybe even for trading.  'Bitcoin' might even fade away as a unit, and simply be used to describe the currency and network as a whole.
Bitcoin will continue to do its uphill battle against people's prejudices as it has done for about 6 years now years now, but I think tipping and micropayments may be the key to overcoming this hurdle.  When people actually own some bits themselves, even if it's just a few cents worth, they'll see it in action, and it becomes something they have direct experience with rather than an arcane abstraction they have to wrestle with through laborious explanations.  
Perhaps even most tip recipients won't take it seriously, but a certain proportion will be intrigued, and endeavour to learn more.  And those who accept the tips but don't look into it immediately will probably still remember they have some, and are likely to come back to it later next time Bitcoin hits the headlines, especially if the price surges again.

Yeah, I may be playing loose with definitions, but that's because the definitions themselves are loose.  Economics isn't a hard science.  It's a bunch of vague approximations to semi-explain what has already happened, but it's lousy at explaining disruptive phenomena like Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin just doesn't neatly fit into any of these pre-defined categories, so I'm just referring to all these assets as if they all belonged to the same universal one.  Assets can go up in value, and they can drop in value - that's all that matters here.  And going by current trends, pretty much all assets drop in value next to bitcoin, making them inflationary - or 'inflationary', if you prefer.

Really? Where?  I don't recall learning about anyone losing their keys while in cold storage.


If you want to be ridiculously secure about it, it would involve doing stuff like generating wallets using a physical random number generator (eg dice), with a computer that has *never* been connected to the internet, while it's operating inside a faraday cage.  But even pretty damn hardcore security enthusiasts would say that's kind of overkill.  
However, if you split up your stash and store it in several different addresses, each generated by a different, highly-regarded method, then if one is compromised, then you've only lost a portion of your holdings.  But like I said, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who has lost any bitcoin to any kind of cold storage.
But bitcoin security is the responsibility of the user, and you need to do your own research.  The difficulty of security is indeed a weakness in the bitcoin network, but over time this is likely to continue to become less and less an issue, with more sophisticated solutions being developed.  Of course, increasing ease of security is likely to push the price up, so if you can do it properly yourself now,  you're likely catching it at a low price.
Maybe this makes sense to you, maybe it doesn't, and it's up to you to judge whether bitcoin is a worthy investment for you.  I for one am in with a respectable amount - I have been since the middle of last year, an I have no intention of pulling out now.

It's not a democracy, it is, as you say, a culture.  The term 'bits' doesn't get voted on, it either gets used, or it doesn't.  It's a [*meme*, in the original sense of the word as coined by Richard Dawkins some 40 years ago.](  If you want another term to take hold, you have to *use* it.  If others like it, then they'll start using it too.  Good luck trying to displace 'bits' though, because it's a meme that has already started to take off.

The latter would be the clear meaning to me.  On signage they would use '£' and 'lb', which would be quite unambiguous.


No, we won't use 'kilobits' any more that we use 'kilodollars'.  There will be bits (the most common term), bitcoins (probably to be often referred to as 'full bitcoins' or 'whole bitcoins'), and if the Bitcoin price grows enough, satoshis.  Indeed I wouldn't be surprised if many people started calling satoshis 'bitcents' - despite the term having already been defined as 0.01 bitcoins (or 10,000 bits).  Mind you, I'm guessing that in conversation, many people will often refer to thousands of bits as 'k', as is now done with thousands of dollars.

Depends how you interpret the analogy.  Your enemies aren't the people themselves, but their political views.  Allow them to accept the Bitcoin Trojan Horse, and you might conquer their political views and convert them to yours.  
But if you trumpet your intentions from outside their walls, ie before they've bought bitcoin, then they're going to be wary.  And this is just going to make it all the more difficult for Bitcoin to succeed, and by extension, your own political cause.  So you're doing yourselves a disservice.

Most purchases aren't in the order of the value of a bitcoin.  If you want to buy a coffee, it'd be something closer to 0.00784 BTC.  That's an ugly number to deal with, since few people are used to dealing with anything more than 2 decimal places when it comes to money, and there are no words like "thousand" or "million" to help you along.  It's much easier to say *"seven thousand eight hundred and forty bits"*  than it is to say *"point zero zero seven eight four bitcoins"*, and there's less chance of getting it wrong.  
And the problem with the decimals just gets worse as Bitcoin increases in value.  Even your aforementioned television would be less than a full bitcoin according to last November's prices.

Doesn't seem to have been a problem for Microsoft.  And besides, at the moment it *is* tiny, at some 15 to the US cent, and a little less than the of a dogecoin.  This means it's not intimidating, which is the real problem with a 'coin' worth hundreds of dollars or more.


I think it would catch on - much faster than 'zib', at least.


Well, 'm' is the symbol for 'milli', so 'u' would probably get used a lot as an approximation of 'µ'.  Mind you, I suggest we forget using the millibit altogether, as it's too confusing to have so many units, and the millibit has already been past parity with the dollar.


Verb?  I haven't heard of the dollar or the cent (or any other currency either) being used as a verb either.  "Can you dollar me 10,000 by Monday?" - no I don't think so.


Except the term needs to actually *catch on*, and this is the first I've heard of the 'zib'.

I'm pretty much with you on all of these points, but I want there to be a fundamental level of welfare, because the detached, the destitute, the homeless, the starving are not free, and mass despair leads to violence.  
If you can figure out a way to provide an unconditional basic income, enough to keep people housed, clothed, connected and kept fed and healthy, then that's when you'll have genuine freedom.  People could earn as much as they wished, search for and pursue new goals, and take risks without the fear of ending upon the street.

Another reason for why I think it would be best to switch to µB is that they're *so* much smaller than BTC's that there will be less confusion than if we use mB as well. No ones likely to accidentally send 2000 BTC as opposed to 2000 µB, but it's quite likely someone might send 2BTC instead of 2mBTC.
And considering that BTC only has to reach $10k for 1µB = 1c, I think making the switch now would be much cleaner.

It does affect it to some degree.  As soon as the news of the likely deal for Greece came through a few days ago, the price dropped some $25.  Such movements immediately after big news like that have happened many times before.  But yeah, overall, it's true that the price moves of its own accord.

Then the trick is to pick a distinctive one.  
Eg 'Google' makes no direct reference to the internet or searching, but it alludes to both.  'Googol' is a mathematical term meaning 10^100, suggesting the kind of vast amounts of data that Google trawls through.  And the similarly spelled 'goggles' refer to eyewear, which refers to looking for stuff.
And 'Apple' makes no reference to computers at all, but it seems to have worked out pretty well for the company.

In proportional or preferential voting systems, minorities may have a say if they gain the balance of power.  So the large parties have an incentive not to alienate the smaller ones or their voter base entirely, because they may have to negotiate with them.  
As Winston Churchill said, democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others that have been tried.  But probably the biggest problems with democracies tend to concern campaign funding.  When the wealthy can buy the legislation they want (ie rent seeking), then the democracy is a joke.  Which means I'm looking at you, USA - with its 'Citizens United' farce, US politics is officially up shit creek for the foreseeable future.  Thankfully, not all countries have such ridiculous open slather campaign contribution systems.

Yeah, to *you* maybe, but it's still not useless in general.  Useless would mean that they offer no services at all.  But many people might use it for smaller amounts, rather than using it to run their lives.  Perhaps they never hold more than $300 in bitcoin in their Circle account, so the limit is of no concern.  Like I said, try looking beyond yourself and your own circumstances.

They can't change the rule about not awarding it to the anonymous without changing the rule about awarding it posthumously.  Because Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever it really is, might actually be dead.  
And if they were to allow the award to go to the dead, then they'd be opening a massive can of worms.  All those dead people who might have received the award but never did will be competing against the living, fundamentally changing the nature of the award, and putting it out of step with the real Nobel Prizes.

Well, I bought my stash in the middle of 2013, I've hodled since then, and I don't plan to stop.  And as I'm not trading, the precise timing of when it goes up (assuming it does) isn't really a concern of mine personally.  
But yeah, obviously if you knew it was going to keep going up at a certain point, and you knew roughly how high it would go, you could sink a lot of money in and then sell once it gets close to the top.  But obviously, such certainly doesn't exist.
@_date: 2015-02-08 02:15:49

Actually, gold as a whole is, by nature, *decentralised*.  People mine gold all over the world, and keep it all over the world.  No government or other institution has a monopoly over it, or over the handling of it.  
But obviously, it's *physical*, so it's impossible to trade online in real time, at least not directly.  So trusted third parties to needed to hold gold and offer online-accessible claims to it, and each of their systems is a centralised one for its hoard of gold.
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:26:31

@_date: 2013-11-04 13:03:36
Not on the scale of decades, no, but the last 4 years has certainly revealed a high level of order.  Have a look at the all-time logarithmic chart:
Every 7-9 months since 2011 has seen a rally followed by a correction, each time settling at least 2.5x higher than where it rose from.  Of course, they haven't been the same in either size or form, but there is enough regularity for me to be comfortable betting on the chance that the price will keep pushing up.  Mind you, there could be a mega-correction at some point that could dwarf that of last April, but I trust that it would recover before long.

One thing that you should learn to use is the logarithmic scale.  Over periods of high volatility, it's essential for making sense of the patterns of the movements of bitcoin.
Here's the all-time chart for the Mt Gox bitcoin price in logarithmic form:
And the same chart in linear form:
Unfortunately, not all chart sites offer logarithmic scale - eg Bitcoinity is one that only offers linear. Though it's generally not much of an issue when you're viewing a shorter time interval.

Here's another one: remember to wash behind your ears.
@_date: 2013-11-04 10:01:47
I haven't been surprised by the movements of the price of bitcoin since the dip in July.  I saw that the pattern was following rather closely (though not exactly) the rally and correction of last year, just on an amplified scale.  I even said so in a submission in and the later in a submission in this sub:
(Mind you, I'm using logarithmic scale, as linear scale is useless for seeing patterns in large, exponential movements.)
Now, have a look at the all-time chart:
and you'll see there's been a rally and correction every 7-9 months since 2011.  Sure, they've been of varying sizes, but there's a high level of similarity between them.  Indeed, this rally and correction pattern has been reflected and superimposed not only the large scale, but on smaller scales, all the way down to the hourly level - essentially a fractal pattern.  The way I read it is that there is huge optimism in bitcoin, but people tend to overestimate its speed of growth, so time and time again the price surges and then pulls back a bit, as the level of optimism overheats and then lets off some steam.  Two steps forward, one step back.
Bitcoin seems to me to be climbing more-or-less under its own momentum, and nothing much seems to have a great effect on its price.  Even events like the Silk Road takedown and the US government shutdown and threat of default seem produce little more than modest blips in the scheme of things.  So bitcoin appears to be really quite a pure market.  The fundamentals have been known for a long time, it's full of people new to investing, and it's just a matter of time for people's understanding of it to grow and spread. And this seems to be producing a high level of order in the price movements.
That's why I went long a couple of months ago, when I saw that the pattern looked like it was just going to repeat again.  Of course, I wasn't *certain* that the pattern would continue, but I had enough confidence to believe it was very likely, and worth risking a healthy chunk of funds on. So I've been riding the new surge with a deep sense of calm - even if the pattern changes and the price tanks for some reason, I won't regret my decisions, since I'm comfortable I made the right choice under the circumstances.

Yeah, a transaction fee a total dealbreaker for me, and 0.5% is insane.  I'm using bitcoin - I don't want to be paying fees to a middleman (aside from the usual miner's fee).  I think just a standard restricted demo + paid full version model would be appropriate.  
You could just limit the number of contacts in the demo version, or maybe you just lose all of your contacts after a trial period, and restrict payments only to anonymous addresses (which wouldn't be stored).  Or have a restriction on the number of bitcoins you could send in one transaction.  
Obviously, you shouldn't have a system where people are in danger of having their bitcoin stuck in an unusable post-trial-period wallet, but as long as you introduce inconveniences in the demo, people will pay for the full version - which couldn't be simpler, considering the kind of software it is.

Localbitcoins, however, is a very popular and very well-trusted site based in Finland.  There are over 500 submissions in this sub that reference it (and that's just the OP's, not the comments):
They have a very effective system for easy buying and selling of bitcoin, and the reputations people build there are very legitimate.  The main advantages regular exchanges have is that you can day-trade, and it's generally cheaper (though with Gox, not necessarily).  Mind you, during periods like now when the price is rallying, the time it takes to get a verified account (assuming you can get one) and do bank transfers can be very costly, and can wipe out any money you might have saved many times over.
I've used several high-reputation sellers in the past, depositing cash into their bank account (so I never saw them face-to-face), and I've never had any troubles receiving my bitcoin.  And the site is responsive to any complaints should any problems or disputes arise.
However, you could check for a seller who will sell small amounts of bitcoin, so that you can take a much smaller risk.  Then you can make further purchases as you become more comfortable.
Also, learn how to make a cold wallet, so you can keep your BTC safe.  Leaving it on an exchange or other online wallet is risky.

If whales are indeed pushing the price of bitcoin up through deliberate manipulation, I'm not sure whether this is really a bad thing.  Sure, their motive will be to make more money, but it doesn't mean they aren't pushing it toward what it is truly worth.
My feeling is that where bitcoin will really take off first will be as a medium for quick, cheap money transmission rather than goods and other services - in particular, remittances.   And that's a pretty big market to take on. I don't know who will become successful at offering such bitcoin-based services, but I believe that in the not-too-distant future, someone somewhere is going to do it and do it well.  This will also bring more attention to bitcoin as a whole, of course.

I believe dismantling the power of the rent-seekers should be a bigger priority than simply abolishing the state.  The problem is oligarchy, and oligarchal control of the state, rather than the state itself.  


Taxes can't exist without property to tax, and property itself is depend on property laws, put in place by the state.  But you are always free to leave your country and go live in a tax haven.


Neither video is 5 minutes long.  The shortest is over 13 minutes.  I watched it, and it's based on the fallacy that property is some fundamental law of physics.  It's not - it is itself based on force.  You call your property yours with the threat of violence against those who disagree with your claim.  
It's also based of the fallacy that the state is necessarily a dictatorship or oligarchy.
I believe the state could become open-source, peer-to-peer - somewhat like Bitcoin, but transparent.  A certain amount of funding could go toward projects for the common good - the types that are difficult to make money off, like tackling environmental problems.  Decisions could be made collectively about how funds should be spent.

You're being silly - I said the *chance* is vastly smaller, not that it was impossible.  And with bitcoin's history of volatility, it's undeniable that that the chance it will halve in value tomorrow is far greater - indeed it fell by almost that much just a few days ago.  But of course, I generally expect it to recover from such plunges quite rapidly.

Yeah, sometimes you forget not everyone lives and breathes computers.  Fortunately for me, I'm geeky enough to have worked out how to do the live Ubuntu DVD boot quite a while ago, but for most people, this is a tough call.
This is the problem of trying to get laypeople into bitcoin.  All too many of those who are involved in the bitcoin ecosystem tend to forget that the *vast* majority of people aren't programmers or computer tinkerers, and think that anyone who isn't is stupid.  When it's actually they who are stupid for thinking this.
Different people have different skills and talents, and the bitcoin world needs to accommodate for all of them if it expects to be adopted by all of them.

Three syllables are still three syllables.  Sure, the term 'millibit' is easy enough to say, and it'll probably get used the most, but even the two-syllable 'dollar' has 'buck'.  Once people know what a millibit is, they won't need all that information conveyed to them - we're people, not computers.  As long as there's a commonly accepted term, then that's enough.  Perhaps, instead of an abbreviation, an unrelated term like 'buck' will emerge.

Of course, but with Silk Road gone, it does demonstrate that bitcoin is independent of any particular black market site.

Protip:  Check the 'log scale' tickbox and you'll get a far more useful chart:
It's the relative rather than absolute movements that are significant.  A $1 change at $20 is as big a deal as a $10 one at $200, and logarithmic scale will show these movements of equal significance as being equally large.  Linear scale is pretty much useless for reading a chart once the movements are big enough.

Implying bitcoin serves no function.  This was unconstructive, as you offer no explanations for *why* it doesn't serve a function, or how the situation might be overcome.


Just a statement of fact - yes these claims are made.


Unconstructive.  You just stereotype a group of people and say that's all there is to it.  And you offer no way out of this situation.

You've got to make a wallet first, and that's a messy business, or risky, or both. The point is that it's far easier to get the innovators and early adopters (like us) on board than the early majority, who are the ones you really need for a new tech to take off. Calling people lazy whiners is just going to turn them off.

Security is paramount, both against theft and against loss of access.  It's in no-one's interest for people to lose their bitcoin, even from just loss of access to their wallet, rather than theft.  Even though dead bitcoins have the effect of enriching all the other holders slightly, it can be devastating for those who lose, and their story spreads, pushing people away by making bitcoin sound scary.  Which indeed it *is*, if you're not up-to-speed and vigilant about your wallet security and management.
I feel that streamlined guides for making and using cold paper wallets should be put front-and centre for newbies.  Most people aren't IT literate, so nothing in electronic form will be as intuitive to keep secure as paper wallets.  Of course even paper has its problems, but it's far easier to develop a system of best practice that people can learn easily.

But the dollar will also be worth zero, so you'd be dividing zero by zero, so bitcoin would be worth infinity.  If that happens, then I'm buying Holland.

Good to see that you're on such amicable terms.  I use both of your sites, though yours mainly for the depth chart.  Your price chart isn't so useful at these times of high volatility, as you have no logarithmic scale option.  Any chance of implementing this?

Price goes according to *perception* rather than the reality of the situation.  With the non-Chinese speakers freaking out, sure the price will plummet.  And the Chinese are obviously taking advantage of this.
Also, learn to use logarithmic scale for your charts, as linear scale is worthless for analysing charts, especially with swings of the magnitude that bitcoin experiences on a regular basis.

Good to hear.
By the way, there's another way to do it if you know someone with a relative living and working in a foreign country who sends remittences back home.  If the relative abroad is able to buy bitcoins wherever they are living, they could sell them to you by having you pay their relatives at home, and sending the coins to your BTC address.  Do it so that it undercuts the Western Union (or whatever) fees for them, and you'd both be happy.
Of course, the relative in the other country would have to be computer literate enough to do this.

You can have a state without rent-seeking (or at least greatly reduced rent-seeking).  If decisions about legislation are made collectively and transparently, there will be no oligarchy to buy off.


If you lived with only one other person, the concept of property would be meaningless.  Your common interests would be paramount, since you'd automatically form a tribe of two members.  You have a far better chance of surviving with two of you than you would with just one.  And so you'd share everything as required.  Unless, of course, resources were too scarce to supply both of you, in which case it would probably mean you'd fight to the death.


No, you just protect a bunch of stuff.  It's not your property until there is a system to recognise your ownership.


No, you can also *leave*.


Because I believe there needs to be a system in place to prevent destitution.  There can be no true freedom if people live in fear of such despair, or indeed, in fear of those who are desperate.


No. Some projects require large-scale cooperation, and some behaviour has to be prevented for the common good.  It would be better to live in a Stalinist state than to wreck the atmosphere, which could end humanity, or at least bring about catastrophic war.  Which wouldn't be great for the cause of freedom.

Personally, I don't think the new Chinese regulations are that big a deal on paper, but people are panicking because other people are panicking - the price is based on *perception*, after all.  And we'll bounce back from this soon enough.  You only lose if you sell (and don't rebuy lower).
