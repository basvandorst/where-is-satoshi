Depends what you are developing, but if its for iOS you HAVE to use a Mac. Which is a big reason you see so many around startups.

I told them no badges or stickers when we agreed on the price of the car. They put them on anyway and I refused delivery until they took them off. May seem kind of dickish but those were the terms we agreed on.

My buddy has 10 lost coins. Bought them for 10 a piece, backed up his wallet to a flash drive. Slipped it into his coat pocket it fell out while he was snow blowing his driveway and the snow blower destroyed it. It is a pretty funny story that we just laugh about now. He used to call it his 100 dollar flash drive, I should give him shit for it now though.

Depending on the type of flash memory used in the phone this may not even be an issue.

We looked into the price to get data off flash memory chips at the time and it wasn't worth it for him. Im sure now he would have quite a different tune though. I do know what landfill it is in though....
