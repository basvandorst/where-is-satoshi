Thanks gamzy777.  :)  I actually joined reddit a couple years ago due to an unhealthy obsession with Bitcoin at that time (hence my username.) But lately I spend most of my time on r/Christianity but will come over here when I see something interesting happening and want to find out what is going on.  Bitcoin still intrigues me but I am not as obsessed with it as I used to be, which is a good thing!  We have to hold onto the things of this world loosely.

Contentment with godliness is great gain. :)
I hope you didn't lose too much in the Bitfinex fiasco.  We had just a tiny bit of BTC in the Mtgox scandal (just a fraction of a coin so nothing to worry about) but it made my husband worried to ever leave anything on exchanges.  We don't really trade them at this point, just hodl unless needed.   Having been on this bumpy ride of crazy bubbles and then huge drops it is almost funny how easy it can come and go!  I do find it helpful in holding onto it all with a little less concern.  God is in control regardless of what is happening in my investments!

I think most of us, if we do some deep soul searching, have things we regret doing.  Prayers are the answer for sure.  There is grace for all that humble themselves.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:19:25
It is a bit more "gray" than it appears at first glance.  I guess we can blame Finex for their ineptitude.  If this guy didn't find the hole, someone else would.  I wish we lived in a world where we all could just do the more noble thing and not take things that don't belong to us, but that isn't the world we are in at this point unfortunately.

He should return it all if he wants a clean conscience.  But I have a feeling he isn't worried about that at this point.  One of these days it will all be in the "light" for all to see though.  All our sins will be made known.  But some people think that if they can get away with it they are just smarter and deserve it somehow, and if they think this life is all that there is, then why not as far as they are concerned? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:17:31
Absolutely!  Having that in the "light" is even more important than some missing BTC I believe.

We logged in to buy at 9200 but it was 9300 by the time we purchased (Coinbase made us verify our account via email again unfortunately!)  It wasn't at 9200 for long!

I figured Andreas had plenty of BTC, the way he has been speaking about it for years.  I guess even if he did start with a good amount if he was living off of them it would be easy to just spend them on expenses.  But this gift of coins to him is certainly well deserved.  I have watched many of his videos online since 2013.  Such a great guy!  :)

Yes!  I keep updating my husband on the price once in a while and I will say, "Bitcoin is eleven hundred."  He will then say, "The price went down ten thousand last night?  Oops.  I meant, "Eleven thousand!"  Of course, it seems like it was just  eleven hundred a few weeks ago. ;)

Hopefully they start actually closing some open tickets.  That should help customer relations! We are out about $6000 since September with an open ticket for a stop loss order on ETH where we were paid $0.  It seemed rather obvious that we are owed some money but we were asked for more information, sent it along and nothing, nada.  We just wait.  I am patient, mostly because we have no other options!  But there is no one to even call.

We still seem to have most of our coins!!!!  At most we have only lost the ones we tried to send yesterday.  But going to look into it still.  The transaction were just "Unconfirmed."  I don't want to say which app until we know for sure it was to blame though.  
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:40:29
I suspect most Bitcoin users are not the MAGA crowd?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:31:55
It is painful how easy it is to lose Bitcoin.  My husband and I had a huge scare a few weeks ago as we were trying to send some coin to Coinbase using our Bitcoin QT wallet but then the address was completely changed behind the scenes.  We don't really know how that happened or if it was from a new app my husband installed?  He is going to try and figure that out at some point.  Long story, but because we paid too low of fees (on accident but I think God's grace now) we had sent a small amount at first but did not copy and paste the address in this case before the larger amount (where we did copy and paste) and an accidental "double-spend" happened where the first transaction went through but because our wallet was so behind in catching up the larger transaction that had been hacked was not confirmed and we were able to get our coins back!  
But this was a much needed lesson for us.  We purchased Trezors (one for us and two for our daughters as we were gifting them some coin to hold for the future.)  On the Trezor we can check to make sure the address is indeed the one we are sending coins to!
We thought we were doing things right.  At least we did have several backup SD cards even offsite we could utilize, so there was that.  It did help for sure!  Once we knew our computer had been hacked we did not even turn it on, we went to the backup SD card.
Sorry OP for your loss!  :(  So hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:28:52
I think most, if not all, of us have some feelings of regret of not getting in earlier.  My husband told me about Bitcoin when the price was only $8!  But we were concerned about the legality of purchasing then.  We were not sure it was even legal to be involved.  But when some money laundering laws were put into place we figured we could jump in a bit.  However, it was really hard to even purchase coins in 2013.  We were stuck with exchanges like Mt.Gox.  Thankfully withdrew almost all the coins (had a small amount there.  I think it was only $100 worth.  I was thinking though that now that $100 would be worth over $1000!  LOL But oh well.)
But we have to somehow overcome the regrets of not buying sooner and just be thankful to be in the "game" now!  It is a wild ride for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:13:22
Husband is waiting to see what coins are left first. Still waiting.  He is taking every precaution on this new machine before using our backup disk. Then he is going to screenshot the pages on other computer where he can show where the coins were sent and then report I think if we can verify they are missing.  But we should report for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:24:30
Some coins are gone.  :(  They finally were "confirmed."  Unfortunately this was super close to the 72 hour wait time that I guess there now is for them to be returned if they are not.  This is a sizable amount of money too.  We probably will have to report, but we don't want to until our other coins are secured on the Trezor and moved.  I am worried to even open the other computer until we do that.  And then when we report won't they want to confiscate the computer perhaps?  This is rather depressing.  I know I am not the only one that this has happened to.  The hacks are just getting way too good now.  I don't even want to keep any of the value in coin at this point.  It is enough to make me want to cash it all out and run.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:14:34
This is totally true!  I had no idea we even had a problem earlier so this is the most painful thing in all of this.  I wish my husband would have told me he had noticed something "weird" in a transaction he had made.  I didn't really even know that the swapping out was something we had to worry about.  If I knew I would have totally advised this.  But it is a little late now.  :(
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:13:32
At the beginning I told all my friends.  It was hard to buy in 2013 though.  The exchanges were all so shady and it was pretty risky then.  When Coinbase came along I told a few more and only a couple of my friends purchased.  One is super excited now.  Her husband said to her with tears in his eyes a few days ago in regards to our advice and the amount of money this investment has earned her, "How do you thank someone for something like that?"   My response was that she doesn't need to thank me.  I am just thankful that one of my friends listened!  It is nice to have someone to talk to about the rise and the falls.  We are not alone. :)  
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:16:35
I think many people just hoard the coins without using the gains, so I understand you cashing out.  I do think it is wise to invest what you can though as we are still most likely early in this.  The plan my husband and I are sticking with is this one if you are interested in one of the better investment strategies with BTC long term:  
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:08:24
The address in Bitcoin-QT was completely verified.  The entire interface matched exactly.
The coins still went to the wrong address.
This means that even using Coinbase or a Trezor is not safe, because no matter how much you verify with your eyes, something different is happening behind the scenes.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:12:46
Actually, I have heard now that double-spends are rejected by 90+% of miners in principle.  So that's not a viable option anymore in 2017 according to the research I did.  Correct me if I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:10:04
We double-checked the address three times.  It didn't matter.  Everything on the Bitcoin-QT interface was correct.  The coins were STILL sent to the wrong address behind the scenes.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:10:49
The only thing missing is the reference to "tulips" in this list. ;)  
As someone who has been involved with BTC for a few years, these same comments were made when the price was $100, $200, $1000, and I guess it shouldn't surprise us that the same things are being said now that the price is over $11000.  Will the same things be said when the price hits $100,000?  I am curious when they will realize that they missed out on one of the best investment opportunities of their lifetime?  
Is BTC volatile?  Absolutely!  Is there some risk?  Sure.  But anyone who has purchased and held for a few years has not lost a dime and made incredible gains.  What about the risk of not investing?  That is the way I look at it.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:42:19
I posted a few weeks ago about some of coins being hacked.  We thought they were totally gone but we got them all back in what I consider a Christmas Miracle yesterday.  I posted this thread over where I spend most of my time on reddit, which isn't the r/bitcoin thread actually ;)  But I just thought you might be interested.
Still think it might be the "ditto" app that swiped the address.  The address was still changed behind the scenes, but for whatever reason we were able to get all of the coins back now.  :)  So amazing.  We promised God if we got them back we would give them all back to Him too.  So some non-profits and our church are going to be pretty happy about that I think. ;) 
Here is the story  I posted if interested:  
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:25:14
We had some coins hacked this week using cold storage!  My husband is a very computer savvy guy too.  We are not entirely sure what happened other than when we tried to move coins somehow the address was swapped in the process.  I even was with him and double checked the address in the wallet before hitting send but then when we went back the address was an entirely different one.  The fees we had calculated were low so we had a long almost three days of hoping the transaction never confirmed (our only seeming saving grace in it all) but unfortunately the transaction confirmed after about 65 hours or so.  Sigh.  I don't even want to write how much we lost.  It is all rather painful.  We were worried our entire wallet was wiped clean but thankfully the rest of the coins are there.  He ordered a Trezor.  We are using a backup disk and not even touching the other computer until all the coins are moved.  Not sure about calling the police?  They will probably confiscate our computer?  I am not enjoing Bitcoin as much as I used to, even though we had the largest sale ever this week when the price hit $19000.  Such an emotional ride. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:48:49
We have sent multiple transactions to Coinbase on the past with no issues.  We checked everything on the screen to make sure it was all correct.  We just didn't know there were such sophisticated hacks that could change addresses completely behind the scenes.  Of course we know better now and will only send a very small amount to test.  But it makes us nervous sending any.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:43:40
I was just relieved when a friend of mine called yesterday, who purchased some coins a couple years ago after I told her about it, telling me she still had them!  I was worried she may have sold as the price dipped a bit after she had purchased but she said she felt a peace about buying and never looked back.  She isn't even selling yet.  She wants to wait until next year. 
My husband did get a text from another friend today trying to fish and see how many coins we have.  That was awkward.  He had already told him we sold quite a bit when the price was only $375, which is true.  Sold more at $600.  Those sales are depressing.  I didn't want to sell either time.  I would have rather had credit card debt for a few more years.  But I guess it was prudent.  We really didn't know what BTC was going to do for sure. We still have some thankfully.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:52:00


Have you seen the Weird Al video called "Word Crimes"?  I don't enjoy it as much as my husband does.  That is probably because I have committed most of these "crimes" though. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:37:46
The app that my husband think may be suspect is called "Ditto."  I guess he recently installed it because he was working from home and it saved him some time coding.  He said he checked carefully online to see if there were any reports of it having problems before he even used it.  Not sure if that is it or not as he did fix a friend's computer that had a virus.
Anyway,  a few coins are still in limbo as they were sent to a different address than what we had entered and even double checked.  It is a pretty sophisticated hack.  My husband just ordered a Trezor online this morning.  I told him to do whatever he needed to do to protect the coins we have left. We are just praying that the few coins somehow are returned because of the fact they are still "unconfirmed."  We feel it was God's mercy that he didn't calculate the fees to send at a high enough price and with the overload in the blockchain this past few days, we may get them back?  Not sure how that works.  We will see.  As far as I am concerned if we get them back we will give the amount we were almost stolen to charities as they were considered lost in our minds as this point.  So the hands of providence can give back or not.  I am honestly not losing any sleep over it, which is really a miracle in many ways!  I used to be a little too obsessed with Bitcoin.  I think my reaction to the potential of having all our coins taken even surprised my husband.  He said he was proud of me for not losing it emotionally.  I just gave him a hug and told him I loved him more than Bitcoin!  But I am glad all our coins were not taken.  It would be harder on him than even me if that were the case.  I think he would have always blamed himself for that, and actually because I am a stay-at-home mom for the most part (I do some side jobs but nothing full-time) Bitcoin has the potential to change my husband's life much more than mine!  He could retire early and pursue some things he desires to do.  But if we lost the coins he would have to stick with the daily grind.  Of course, as a software engineer he does really well and likes his job for the most part, thankfully.
Bitcoin is not for cowards!  It is certainly a "ride!"  
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:41:19
There would be a way to save our transaction that has some confirmations but isn't finalized?  I wouldn't even know where to start doing this.  I will let my husband know.  I figured it was too late now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:30:50

If I was handling them I would just put them all on Coinbase.  I know I am not very tech savvy.  The problem is that we have been involved since early 2013 so we know how dangerous exchanges can be.  But I have always just trusted he knew how to keep them secure.  I made sure not to have access to the computer they were on myself as I don't trust myself to not get a virus or whatever.  I am ready to just move all coins onto Coinbase as it seems rather obvious we both are not too good at security.  But I will let him decide.  
I don't think he has ever felt very confident in the area of cyber security though, unfortunate for us now.  Sigh. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:32:35
GDAX has different limits even though it is connected with Coinbase.  Look into that. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:09:01
Well, you can try reasoning with her by telling her that there are far more people who regret not buying and regret selling than those who have purchase and held.  Hopefully she will start to see the wisdom in this risk.  All great investments require some risks.  They have been saying that Bitcoin is a "bubble" since the first one.  There have been several.  My husband and I debate if we are even going to have a correction on this run, however, as we have Nasdaq and CME and even a Japanese futures exchange joining in now.  We may be entering a more vertical stage.  But it is hard to say.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:37:46
Me too.  I didn't chime in until page 10 though. ;)
I often wondered if GameKyuubi was playing off a post I had made a few days earlier where I said, "Holders Unite!"  I think the price had dropped to around $60 then too.  I can't believe it has been 4 years since then! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:10:00
We purchased our first few coins at around $55.  Several more as the price bubbled in 2013.  We purchased too many though and were struggling for a while because we overextended ourselves.  A newbie mistake I am sure. ;)  Had to sell some off at $375, unfortunately.  But we are now divesting according to this plan: 
It has removed most of the emotional response so we can just stick with the plan and see how it goes.  So far so good. :)  Emotions are bad when it comes to investments we have learned! 
@_date: 2018-09-14 15:29:47
Right!?  I am far more interested in what that sign says.  It looks like a bunch of disclaimers.  "We are not responsible..."  The last line though?  "We are not responsible for your...well being?"  
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:13:14
We think our coins we tried to send yesterday may have been hacked. My husband was using a new app to copy and paste and is worried as he thought he noticed the address swapped out one day.  But yesterday he double checked but still not one confirmation.  :(  This is a sizable amount too.  We are not logging in back on the network though.  He is using his phone network right now and a new laptop to check to see if we have any coins.  It is painfully slow as I am waiting to see if we have any coins left. We did double check one wallet we have an address for and a small amount of coin was still there so hopefully that is a sign that all our coins were not swept.  So stressful.  But I am just trusting that God has a reason for all of this.  He likes to teach me things.  This is a lesson I would rather not learn, but I shouldn't put all my hope, joy, peace etc. . . in BTC.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:14:26
I was there (Page 10.  Had to look it up.)
I said, "Hodlers never regret hodling if they hodl long enough."  Those words are still true.
BUT I would add that hodlers need to be careful how they hodl!  We just purchased a trezor.  Should have done that before trying to transfer some coins and having them swiped.  We double checked the address too but I guess there are now some very sophisticated hacks that can change addresses completely behind the scenes.  But still so thankful we have hodled some!
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:20:13
Wish there wasn't so much misinformation out there then. My husband decided it wasn't worth doing based on what he had read.  Extremely expensive lesson for us to learn.   We are nervous even moving any of our remaining coins now though. Maybe this can ease our fears a bit knowing that there is still a "plan B."  It still sucks that there are such sophisticated hacks.  We checked each digit of the address.  It was correct from our point of view.  Makes it really hard for the average guy to hold coins in their own wallets.  I wish we had put everything on Coinbase, but I know so many Bitcoin enthusiasts say this is not the best thing.

For those of us who have been around for a few years and can look back, it has generally always been a great time to buy.  The question is more, "How long are you planning on holding?"  
I was just chatting this morning with my husband about how we felt frustrated that we purchased a bit at $250 in 2013 then had to wait for over a year or so to get back to that price. It doesn't matter that much now.  Granted, it would have been better to purchase twice as much at $100, but there is always going to b some "Would have, should have and could have's" we ponder with this crazy investment.  
Read this plan and stick to it is my advice: 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:05:44
My husband and I were just walking our dogs this morning and contemplating how we might hit our next sell point of $19000 by this weekend at the rate it was going.  We were both shocked when we noticed it hit.  That was the best walk we ever took.  ;)  I didn't realize dog walking could be so lucrative! 
@_date: 2018-09-14 15:33:01
:(  Are you invested in BTC?  Just hold for a few years.  The relatively small amount my husband and I purchased in 2013 is now funding his early retirement.  
I just wish there wasn't so much civil unrest in SA.  It seems like a beautiful country in many ways.  I have never been but I have a soft spot for the country as my pastor and his family is from there.  Such a lovely family! They still have family and friends in SA though and I am sure they are concerned.  Also, one of my best friends and her husband are from there but she has been in the US for over 20+ years now.

We actually traded most of our BCash yesterday morning for BTC.  What great timing right? LOL  It is almost funny how bad my husband and I are timing these things. It just seemed the price for BCash was fairly high and a good time to trade.  I guess we are glad to fully dump all BCash though as we don't like the crap going on with BCash.  So even if my husband and I could have made more money waiting, it feels good to be out.  Have some coins to trade on Coinbase still but are trying to do that as soon as the exchange opens for trading.  I think most of us just want to dump BCash if we have been invovled for a while.

Been involved in BTC since early 2013 but we really over purchased on those two bubbles so we had to wait out the long and painful two years.  This run is really the first one where we are starting to really feel the difference in the choices we are making and seeing the rewards for just patiently waiting.  Some things we are doing are paying cash for our oldest daughters college (have other revenue sources for this as well but we now have the cash in hand for the rest of her college fund!)  Also putting some money aside for our second daughter who is going to graduate from high school soon.  We have done some small fixes on the house that really needed to get done.  I am starting an indie music project that I have fully funded, which is great because as an indie artist it is pretty hard to make money. ;)  Also, we have money set aside for a mission trip I am going on next year.  That really is the first priority for me and it is great that the women I am inviting I can tell them not to worry about the cost.  If they want or can donate to the trip, that will be great!  There will be plenty to do there and the more funds we get the more we can do!  
Today, as I was dreaming of the number hitting our next sell point (we are just selling 10% of our remaining holdings each time the price doubles) I was looking at real estate.  It may be wise to purchase more property to diversify our investments.  My husband noticed me looking at houses though and immediately said, "Nothing over 4000 square feet!"  He reminded me of the time we were looking at a model home and seriously got tired just walking through that large of a house!  We could play "hide and seek" for fun though, I told him!  ;)  We have friends with a home that is over 5000 square feet though and the cost of maintenance is something to consider.  Everything is more:  electricity, heat, gas, plus a housekeeper is needed because the home is so big it is hard to clean.   Not sure if we will really buy anything, but it is fun to look.   Hubby really doesn't want to move he said.  He would rather just fix up our house and donate more funds.  Probably a better use of time and money.

Edit:  My husband's economics teacher was so bad that she did not notice that when they had a classroom game about companies and stocks, that his team had printed more stock sheets and ended up with more than they had even started with to win the game.  I guess the kids still learned something there though!  LOL

Indirectly related to Bitcoin, but the video was great.  I am interested in watching all of Chris Martenson's videos "The Crash Course" now.  They would be great for teens to watch in their economics classes.

I had a sell in place for $19,200 on Gdax.  It hit while my husband and I were just walking our dogs.  Nice present to come home too. :)  So it was "legit" but now we are having a hard time moving more coin onto Coinbase to sell a bit more if/when the price reaches $40,000.  Sent the coin this morning but then we haven't had a single confirmation yet.  
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:35:20
I was actually thinking the same thing.  Doesn't mean it is true, but for those of us who have been involved since 2013, there were discussions like, "We will never see $100 again" and people mocked that.  With the traction we are gaining with institutional money on the brink of being thrown in, things will change quickly.
Should be a fun ride.  
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:50:37
I think we have seen solid support at $8000 now.  I highly doubt we go back to $6000 ever.   
If you are looking for a good plan though, I recommend this one for long term BTC investment:  
My only regrets, as an investor since 2013, is not following it more precisely.  
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:13:45

Great article.  I too am very much a Bitcoin "BullChick" as I like to call myself. ;)  If we look at the big picture, this year has been phenomenal in the growth and development of the infastructure needed to make Bitcoin successful.  With that in mind the price really isn't much of a concern.  But it is true, so many people just have a narrow focus.  They can't imagine the price beyond what they see in front of them.  As a real estate agent, which I work at part time, it is kind of like the clients that cannot see a potential in a house because it isn't staged.  However, once the furniture is in place they suddenly see the value.  The trick to getting a "good deal" is seeing the value before the furniture is put there!  ;)  Some of us are more visionary than others I guess and we can use that to our advantage, but at some point people will once again realize that Bitcoin is not going anywhere.  We will see articles in the press saying, "Bitcoin is back!" even though some of knew all along it never went anywhere and was growing all along.

I read a post saying it was most likely dropping due to the South Korean exchange raid.  I am a bit confused why that would cause a drop though.  I mean, if they discovered that the exchange was not really holding real coins, then if I was an investor there and had funds to pull from, I would absolutely be finding another exchange to get some real coins on.  So it should raise price due to demand for "real" Bitcoin.   
@_date: 2014-12-07 21:54:30
I am actually surprised by this.  There hasn't been much Bitcoin marketing or support here.  The OC Register never has any news about BTC.  I have never seen any stores in Orange County with BTC logos in them (there may be some but I haven't seen any yet)  This is definitely a step in the right direction.  :)
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:14:53

The news about the 30 million was already announced before this in some places.  If this was the case they should have at least added a comment about it. Hopefully the fact that there is growth is bullish enough for some growth as it is.

I think now is a good time to buy back in.  Hey,  I told people to buy in when the price was $250 and was mocked.  It was on the r/Christianity forum and they seemed to think my motives were not pure in recommending the investment.  The price never went back to that low of a price after I said that either though.  So maybe I am not too bad at making calls?  Hmmm.  ;)

Explain that almost all successful entrepreneurs are risk takers to a certain degree and you are young enough that it will not affect your life that greatly if you lose this.  The risk is much less than many investments anyway.  I am not sure how you can explain this but try. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:07:32
I believe there is a good chance, especially if an ETF is opened on Wall Street.  It could be even higher than that by then if all goes well.

Read up on how to secure your wallet and make sure to back it up and don't lose your key.  Then invest as much as you can afford to lose as soon as you possibly can and then hold those coins.  If I had done that when I first invested I would have twice the amount of coins I have now.  I thought I would just play it safe and invest just $500 when coins were about $50 in March of last year.  They went to $266 a month later (then crashed back down but that is the way it goes).  I bought more at around $100 or so but it would have been nice to get more at $50. ;)  Also, avoid day trading, or at least only trade with a small percentage of your portfolio.

An infomercial for Bitcoin?  Is this bullish?  ;)  I hope so.

Why does this mean the "Party is over?"  Hey,  I am just glad to see an article in the LA Times.  They rarely post anything at all about Bitcoin so this is great news.  ;)  Also, I already claimed some Bitcoin capital gains on my taxes a month ago.  I am glad they did not say that I had to claim it as a "Currency."  That taxes for currencies are actually higher.  All is well.

@_date: 2014-03-30 22:46:10
They run out when they are selling too many.  Keep trying.  They will buy more and they will be available at some point.  That is a bullish sign as far as I am concerned though.
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:46:17
Envy and jealousy perhaps?  They think that they are too late to have the gains that many of us have made.  But the reality is that there are still plenty of gains to be made.  Not to mention, that many "early adopters" have already sold much of their coin stash.  After I realized that we are still very early in this I jumped in wholeheartedly and I have never regretted it! 
@_date: 2014-10-26 23:50:51

I think having some parts of the film in other languages with English subtitles might give the movie a more "international" flare if you will.  I actually enjoyed that part of it.

And we wonder why people say Bitcoin believers are "cult like" followers? Hey,  it beats some of the ideas that the Jehovah's Witnesses are trying to talk about so I guess it is an improvement.  I spent about an hour the other day debating with one.  She was stuck on her belief that Jesus was not God.  I tried to point her to the 1st chapter in the book of John where it says, "In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God and the Word WAS God."  Then it goes on in verse 14, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us." But she just couldn't see my viewpoint.  Then I tried to get her to say that she did not think I was going to heaven because of my belief and she was unsure.  I said, "Millions of Catholics and Protestants hold that Jesus was God and part of the trinity but you say they are all wrong?" She said, "Yes." As you can see the conversation did not go anywhere.  ;)

My husband and I have been investing since 2013 and joke that as bad as we have been at this investment (selling too low and buying too high at times) the fact that we still are hodling some coin and haven't lost anything shows how it is really hard to lose money investing in BTC when simply patient enough! 
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:50:47

Reading comments like these bring to mind the verse "pride comes before a fall."  Warren Buffet is so sure Bitcoin isn't worth even a portion of his portfolio?  Isn't diversification always a good idea?  It feels like I am watching a game of Risk unfold in front of my eyes and these big players think they are so secure and winning the "game" but all takes is a few more strategic plays and their fortunes could quickly be lost.  (I hate playing Risk BTW.  I always think I am doing so well but then I see my impending doom.)

I don't see any shortage of demand for lottery tickets and Vegas is as popular as ever.  Not that volatility is ideal, but bubbles do create more excitement and interest in Bitcoin.  Until we reach full "maturity" which will be a while, the bubbles are actually very helpful I believe.

I was just saying that "Zero" is pretty extreme stance.  I at least can say that I can understand why someone came to the conclusion that life could have evolved.  But there is no observable evidence of this. We see changes within a kind, of course, but the big issue is with Macroevolution, or seeing the changes from a monkey to man etc. . . Also, mutations are never beneficial, we have a known number of mutations which mathematically prove humans could not have been on earth for more than 10,000 years (by calculating the number of mutations that have occured).  Also, there is still helium on the planet.  Helium is known to have a limited life and there wouldn't be any on the earth if the earth was millions of years old for another example. I could go on. We just don't have enough "time" even with millions or billions of years for the changes that needed to take place to evolve to the place we are now.  So for you to say that there is "Zero" evidence is extreme.

I just read the news about the South Korean exchange being investigated.  I would think that if they were saying that they were holding coins, but really were not, it would cause the price to increase.  If I were a wealthy investor in South Korea I would want to find a more legit exchange to purchase coins on if there was a chance I didn't actually have "real" coins on UPbit.  Anyone have a reason why news like this causes a price drop? 
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:52:03
It would be nice to know where you purchase coins from.  Also, is there any way Circle can show proof of holding actual coins?  Some rumors are around about using fractional reserve tactics, which would be a negative thing for the Bitcoin price.

I have been thinking the same thing about my church but I have a feeling that I might be the only one that would donate to them that way so at this point it probably is not really worth it to them.  But if you can convince yours to accept BTC it might actually bring some attention to your church for sure.  Wouldn't it be the first church to do so?  It could spur some donations from people who don't even attend there perhaps.
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:23:50
You start off putting only 5% of your wealth in Bitcoin.  Then it suddenly and quite unexpectedly (even though the bulls forewarned this) find you now have 25% of your wealth in Bitcoin without adding any more cash into it.  Then, after some drops but then another great run you find it is now 75% of your wealth!  This is why some of us are so crazy about it! ;)  This scenario is pretty close to what happened to me.
@_date: 2014-04-30 16:02:46
My "idea" is that they should buy the coins ASAP.  Then just divide the amount they have among the students in the Fall.  The $100 worth of BTC could be several hundred by then, especially with the Bloomberg news and other things in the works.  If students were given $500 they would be a little more motivated to get involved.  Just my thoughts.

The survey did not ask if they believe it will surpass that.  It just asked what the "moon" was.  ;)  The moon for me is over a million.  I think 10K is highly likely and perhaps even 100K.  But over a million seems crazy and that would definitely be "the moon."  So perhaps there should have been a question that asked what people really believed the price would reach.

From personal experience it is difficult to explain how to purchase and store Bitcoin to the average person.  For example, my husband's aunt wanted to purchase them but her computer was full of viruses so my husband said she shouldn't store her coins on there until it was cleaned up.  He did not have time to do it because he was only visiting for the weekend so Coinbase was the best option for her.  Granted, even that was difficult to help her set up using just her older cell phone.  Also, non technical friends are not very comfortable with the storing and use of Bitcoin without the help of a site like Coinbase.  We explain the risks and then let them make up their minds.
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:35:03
People get nervous when the price falls and they sell off.  Many of these same people, or some that have been waiting on the sidelines to see what happens, will be more than happy to throw their money in when the price is rising.  It is just human nature.  Many of us are buying now.  When things seem a bit depressing it is the best time to buy.  When there is euphoria and the price has just risen substantially it is a good time to sell.
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:30:18
I think he paid more than market value obviously.  Knowing the purchase price would really boost the price up a bit and start a new rally.  But for those of you out there that really don't care if the price of Bitcoin increases I guess it doesn't matter?  I have a few purchases I really need to make though so a price increase right about now would be a very good thing for my own selfish reasons. ;)

I think that report hurt Bitcoin a bit in that they gave a cap value of $1300 I seem to remember.  I had friends that said that they would not buy any because it was close to that price already (it was around $1000.)  Granted they were better off waiting, but the BofA report slowed things down a bit I believe.

Funny.  I kind of feel sorry for the guy but I do agree that most early adopters have lost some coins along the way.  It is just part of the "fun" of being involved early I guess.  My scare was with Bitfloor when the site closed and I had cash on there.  Thankfully we were actually refunded and I learned my lesson not to keep cash or coins on an exchange.  Of course, I think most companies are a bit more professional now.  Hopefully.

Next time can you buy them on an exchange instead of a "private sale" to help the market move up a bit more. ;)

Yes,  I agree that the "debt" will never be paid.  It is just a way to keep the control and power over the victim.  If IndianaJill is indeed in the US she should be able to go to law enforcement and seek help and explain her situation and find some safety.  If she has bitcoin funds that are accessible that should provide the funds needed to return home.  The biggest worry is if the so called "management" knows where her family lives and she has the threat of harm though.  :(  Perhaps the family could move so they couldn't be located?

Say, "no problem."  Then if and when the price is 100X what you offered to pay him that he could have been paid in Bitcoin. :)  You could say, "Sorry bro.  I tried to pay you $100 in Bitcoin.  It would have been worth $10,000 now."  
@_date: 2014-05-21 02:26:37

With comments like this: "Bitcoin is a tremendous breakthrough in computer science. If there were Nobel Prizes for computer science, this was one that would definitely win.

I am not a "bro" and trust me when I tell you that the people in India that supposedly cannot use their cell phones are very good at using them constantly.  They are on Facebook.  Many are probably even on Reddit.  Yes we need to have more development for ease of use, but that is what the entire point of this thread is about.  It will naturally become easier and easier to use, as it already has to a certain degree, and when that happens it will be the most revolutionary for those people that have limited access to banking and credit cards.  IMHO
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:25:40
I think many people were speculating that there would be a new ATH by mid July.  Because it did not happen some people that were holding or waiting to sell until then have now given up and sold thinking that the price is not going anywhere at this point.  However, once this last round of sell offs are complete we will proceed to a new ATH I believe, especially with the various funds that are about to open in the next few months.  
@_date: 2014-03-24 15:27:35
I understand that how many people believe one thing is not necessarily proof of it's validity.  But I guess I was trying to convince her to see that she was being a bit narrow minded.  I discussed with her that true salvation is a humble and repentant heart towards God and that God looks at our hearts and then was telling her that there will be Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostals, and basically people from all denominations of Christianity, and maybe even Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses that truly have a heart after God in heaven.  She still seemed to think I was in trouble and said I was a "Lost Sister."   Thankfully God is the judge of that. ;)

@_date: 2014-03-24 02:43:36
If you have some cash to spend I would buy more coins.  The most depressing thing will be to have Bitcoin now rise up to $2000 per coin or more in the next few months with your coins lost on Gox.  If and when Gox is able to distribute some coins to their customers then you will just have more coins.  Hopefully they figure out a way to give a percentage back to each person at least but I wouldn't count on it.
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:09:07
My advice to all "noobs" reading this is learn from our mistakes.  If you are going to buy make up your mind how much you want to spend total and buy as much as possible now.  Don't say, "I will buy a little and see how it goes." Most of us did that only to regret it and then panic buy as the price goes up.  Also, realize that there will be dips later.  There will be an new all time high.  We don't really know what that will be.  We can speculate and dream but no one really knows for sure.  Decide if you want to sell some systematically up to the top or just ride it out, but for those that hold during the ups and downs it is fun ride and don't panic sell when the price drops.  Just expect it at some point and hold for several months until the next run up in price.  Just my two cents here.
@_date: 2014-04-17 03:40:35
Coinbase.com is really good for those that want to dabble in it.  I would just tell him to set up an account there and buy what he wants to buy.  You could tell him that now is a great time to buy and that he really should put as much as he is willing to risk into it asap.  But of course, most people start of slow I have learned.  It is hard to throw cash into something that seems so foreign.
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:10:24
January was better than the end of November!  So I say well done!  Hopefully you bought a few more last month when we were below $400 for a bit. ;)

It is amazing how difficult spending money becomes when I think that "this dinner out that is only $10 today could potentially cost me $100 or $1000 if Bitcoin takes off."  So I too have saved way more than I dreamed I could.  ;)  The hard part is spending anything now!
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:35:50
Great!  Hopefully he buys soon and then the price goes on a nice run from here.  He will be totally hooked then and only regretting not buying more.  ;)  That is how it works for most of us anyways.  It is always great having owners of companies adopt Bitcoin.  They talk to other owners of other companies and that is how the word gets out there.
@_date: 2014-10-24 05:22:50

I still spend some, but only when it is totally necessary!  Otherwise everything is saved in BTC.  The hard part is now determining what is discretionary spending or truly a necessity.

I was a little worried about that before I purchased any.  This was before there was regulations put into place last year for money laundering laws.  I guess tell them that cash is used far more often than Bitcoin for drugs and that much of the cash we carry in our wallets even has traces of drugs on it.  Bitcoin is even more traceable than cash so it is even preferable to use Bitcoin because there is a chance of those using it for nefarious purposes to be caught at some point.  Also, let your friend know that I regret being afraid to buy.  It literally cost me thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of potential profits by being afraid.  I could have purchased coins at $5 but I was afraid of being tied to something illegal then.  :(  Tell them not to make the same mistakes some of us regret.  
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:15:59
I would definitely buy now.  Of course, I am generally very bullish so keep that in mind.  But according to the charts it would be difficult to find a much better entry point this past year than we have right now.  Of course, keep in mind that Bitcoin can be volatile.  Also, keep in mind how addicting watching the charts can be if, and when, the price rebounds.  ;)
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:19:18
The funny thing about Bitcoin is that you start with 5% then it can very quickly become a much larger percent!  That is what happened to us after just one year of investing.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:19:33
I don't know.  I am shocked that greed hasn't driven the price up further than it already has.  You would think that when people hear that they could potentially be making 100X their initial investment in a year, or basically turning about $10 into $1000 like it did last year they would be throwing cash in like crazy.  But instead people just balk at it.  I don't see that many people saying that the lottery is a stupid thing and Bitcoin is way less risky.  Sure there are altruistic reasons why it is good for the world, but even for the "greedy" there are reasons to buy a coin or too. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:17:03

@_date: 2014-03-27 21:53:30
I was scared when I bought my first coins too.  It was only about $50 a coin then.  I spent about $500 and thought I was maybe just throwing away my money.  Plus the exchanges were a bit "shadier" then.  I had to wire money to the exchange.  But my fear quickly subsided when the price jumped a month later.  My only regret?  Not buying sooner and not buying more!  You might want to hold onto a little bit and not spend it all in one place. ;)
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:31:30
I liked it.  I just wish that they had spoken to a few people that had purchased Bitcoin as an investment, not just miners or those that are working in Bitcoin related industries.  There are some of us that do not fall into either of those categories.  We just see the potential and are buying some. :)  Otherwise, I think it was an honest and good overview of what is happening in Bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:41:07
Um.  The IRS knows what the IRS wants to know.  They can get information from exchanges perhaps?  I am sure that they will find a way if they really want to. I would not risk trying to hide it, but then I have never been one to look for ways to avoid paying taxes.  Of course I look for legal ways to pay less taxes though! ;)

I bought more than I planned because of the drop in price this week!  After being involved in Bitcoin for about a year now I have learned that days like today are the best days to buy.  The sentiment is a bit depressing and it almost makes it hard to buy any because of that but things can turn around so fast in the market.

Too bad that they didn't have any information about the ETF that they could share.  They could wait until the room was mostly empty and then say, "For those of you that waited, we have an announcement and you are the first to know!"  ;)  That would have been fun for them.  Sigh.  Oh well.  I am surprised that they have not gotten used to speaking in front of crowds yet?  I have seen them in interview situations and they are great.  Maybe they should just do that approach, have someone ask them questions.  It might work better with their personalities.  
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:49:52
I am sure that they had some coins to begin with, but I can't seem to find any information on where they purchase more.  I would hope that they are not using any fractional reserve tactics and really do purchase coins.  A little transparency in this would be nice. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:36:05
10 Bitcoins puts you in the top 0.35% holders of Bitcoin in the world I believe.  (There is a thread about adoption out there on Bitcointalk.org  )  So it is plenty to make you very wealthy.  Sure, there are earlier adopters that have more coins.  Many of them have lost them, sold them, or if wise are still holding many of them but it is a very small percentage.  I used to be a bit envious of those that purchased before me until I realized that we are all very early in this and it is more a question of how long we choose to hold coins than how many coins we actually have.  A person with 1000 coins that sold them at $100 will end up with the same amount of cash as the person with 10 that sold them at $10,000.  Of course, as many true Bitcoin lovers like to reiterate, there might come a day when you don't have to cash them out at all.  It will be exciting to see how it all pans out the next couple of years.  
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:16:12
I guess the "Big News" is that there is an easier way for the people of Dubai to invest if they choose too.  It does not seem like it will be terribly obvious though.

If we look at many of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world almost all them had to take huge risks to get where they are.  Sure, Bitcoin has it's risks, but the rewards do make it a highly enticing opportunity, some say it could be the best one in our lives.  If Bitcoin really does reach world-wide use and is the "internet of money" than purchasing 100BTC was one of the best risks you have ever taken.  I am not sure how much of my net worth is in BTC (I have some real estate) but I have almost all my cash reserves in it.  Wish I had more to throw in!  :)

I have actually had two female friends invest.  Unfortunately they spent more for their coins than even your friend has at this point.

Have a little compassion for your parents.  They have never seen an investment opportunity like Bitcoin so they have no way of really understanding it.  I have talked to my parents about it and they just act like it is is investing in stocks and cannot seem to grasp that the kind of gains I have made.  At this point I just tell them that "Bitcoin is doing well" and leave it at that.  They keep wondering how I have the money to do all the things I am doing or planning on doing (Disney World, mission trip to India, husband's new Mercedes) but I just tell them causally that "Bitcoin is up."  ;)

Are you looking to spark interest for people who really don't care at all about Bitcoin? How about highlighting some of the "larger than life" characters that have purchased some amazing things because of being early adopters.  On the Bitcointalk Forum there is "Goat" and he purchased a Lamborghini a few months ago.  Also, there is Risto Pietila who just purchased a villa/mansion in Estonia I think it is.  A retreat he is calling "Malla."  Those are just a couple people to start with.   When people who are not familiar with Bitcoin see how successful people have been that have invested by mining or purchasing coins they will be intrigued.  Of course you will want to have some more "meaningful" content if you will, but if you are looking for a story that is interesting this could help a bit I believe.  It is great news that you are working on this BTW!  :)  Any press on a national level for Bitcoin is great for all of us that have some.

This just seems to be normal Bitcoin fluctuations and I would expect a rise back to $1000 at least.  It is hard to know the right time to jump into Bitcoin.  It is always more fun to purchase during the bubble as the price is rising.  Now is a much more painful time to purchase, although a wiser time to do so in hindsight.  
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:22:42
Systematically selling off some as the price increases isn't necessarily a bad idea for taking advantage of the ups and downs, but I would definitely hold a majority of my coins for several years to see how much growth really happens with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-09-17 17:02:53
Have you sold your coins?  If not, you really haven't lost $, just the amount of coins you could have accumulated, perhaps. There are only two prices you need to be concerned with in regards to BTC, the price when you purchase and the price when you actually sell them.  I know that if you need the funds though that is when it can get a bit difficult.

But "failure" is part of the learning process.  If it was my child and they approached me with an investment idea I would have them explain the pros and cons and then let them decide what they wanted to do.  Although it is on a much smaller scale, I have my young children earn money doing things around the house.  This money is theirs to do whatever they want with.  The have made some stupid purchases and wasted money but those purchases have been great learning experiences and now they are more careful in how they manage their funds.  They make sure the things they buy are something that they have thought about and really want without just buying it based on emotions.  It has been a great thing for them.  So I think even "bad" risks are great opportunities to learn from.

Are you joking that Bitcoin doesn't solve any problems?  I have seen so many problems BTC can solve!  To start with, I really wished Bitcoin was more ubiquitous when I traveled overseas the past couple of years so I could save on the fees banks charge for currency exchanges.  But that is just a small thing.  Having just got home from India, and seeing the wide use of cell phones in even the most remote villages but no real banking ability, there is a huge need for Bitcoin to be adopted in places like this. My husband has used it to send funds to a friend at lunch in seconds to pay him back instead of bothering going to an ATM.  A huge time saver!  It is just a matter of time I believe until it revolutionizes how we use money.

Bitcoin has a way of experiencing exponential growth followed by several months of consolidation.  We are in a period of extended consolidation, perhaps because people overbought but also because of Mt. Gox and now issues in China.  Just wait a few months.  The price will skyrocket, followed by a few months of consolidation and so on.  But to say it is a depreciating asset is not true.  It started at pennies and is now worth over $500.  How is that depreciation?

Bitcoin is risky, but I still think that for some of us that really had very little "savings" to begin with throwing as much as we possibly can into it is still not a bad idea.  My husband likes to say, "$10,000 doesn't really change my life but $100,000 or $1,000,000 certainly can." What is the worst that can happen?  We lose our relatively small investment and end back right where we started?  But there is so much to gain that we have to consider the opportunity costs of NOT investing.  As time goes on, and the value of our Bitcoin holdings increase then the question will have to be made about how to diversify.

You say the "more payment options the less people donate?" How is this so? I would think having a small Bitcoin logo to click on would not deter most people.

I read somewhere, not sure where now, that the SEC might purposely not reject and just let it run it's course so that it is automatically approved.

Reading up on the history of BTC since 2013, there has always been talk about wanting a "slow and steady" or more "healthy" rise.  But this is Bitcoin.  There seems to be no such thing. ;)  My husband even said that he was sure that this last bubble would be the final one.  I wasn't so sure, but the FOMO was there and I figured maybe he was right?  There was more interest than ever and talk of an ETF finally being approved.  I do think that there might be a point in the adoption curve where it is kind of like the point of no return and we no longer have these dips.  But so far it has been the same cycle over and over and over.  But if we are following an S-Curve for new technology, it should end well.  
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:00:47
Not a "boyo" but a "sista" checking in ;) but I think it is just long overdue.  As a long time hodler this has been my mindset since before hodling was a thing.  
Hoping it rises fast now.  We have some really big bills to pay and will have to sell next month regardless.  
Doesn't it always rise after tax day too though?  I seem to remember that's historically been the case.

I think everyone deals with the "would have, should have and could have's" with regards to Bitcoin investing.  Was able to listen to Dan Held (who is the director of Business development at Kraken) a few weeks ago and hearing him share stories of the early days was entertaining.  He pondered how many had their stash hacked, spent it all, and learned from trying to trade that hodling for a long time is really the best strategy.  
I agree that it isn't really when someone gets into the game that matters, it is more about how wise the investors are in security and patience.

Having been involved since 2013,  absolutely. I wouldn't expect anything less. (My husband is always the one who thinks when the price is rising we have reached the vertical point of the exponential adoption curve.  At some point he will be right.  We are not there yet though based on the bubble cycles we are going through.)
Bitcoin is a fun ride for those who can hodl on.  ;)
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:07:11
So many people complained it was "too expensive" at basically each step.  Looking back I can see that there are certainly waves to this though.  We have to decide where we are on the curve.  I think that we are in the middle of another bubble right now but still fairly early so not a horrible time to jump in.  But as it climbs to $5000 there will be even greater FOMO and more money thrown in and that is when it is most likely not a good time to buy (but to sell of course).  Then just wait for the cycle to repeat.  It seems to be a  pattern for sure.  As the adoption process continues we will most likely see these cycles until there is more "full" adoption that has taken place, IMHO. 
This is the investment/divestment plan that my husband and I are following and I think it is incredibly helpful for not getting too emotional in this, BTW, if anyone is interested:

I am a fairly long term hodler but we all have to choose our own path.  I still think it is a good time to invest.  In regards to BTC we all have our "would have, should have and could have" moments!  My husband told me about it when it was only $5 per coin but we were afraid to invest because when didn't know if it was legal or not. 
I posted this on r/Christianity over a year ago    I am pretty sure no one listened to me there either.  I am so tempted to post an "I told you so" post today but that wouldn't be very "Christian" of me I am afraid. ;)

We obviously have a greater base of investors than we did in 2013.  Many pull their funds out of BTC when they believe the price is dropping.  These same individuals are waiting to pour the funds back in when they believe the price is moving in the right direction. FOMO is a real thing.  It seems to cause more panic then the sell-off do actually.   
Social climate and perception is so much better than 2013 now too!  Bitcoin is seen as a legitimate investment opportunity.    
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:08:18
Posted this above as well but this is the investment/divestment plan that my husband and I are following and I think it is incredibly helpful for not getting too emotional in this, BTW, if you are interested:  
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:37:34
I think most, if not all, of us that have been involved with BTC for a while have a long list of "would have's, should have,'s and could have's" when it comes to investing. My husband and I have decided to not be emotional about it (learned that the hard way during the 2013 bubbles).  We are now just sticking to this plan:   
So far it is been a huge help and we are totally in the black and it is great to have a plan in place because we really don't know where this is all going.  This plan is keeping us grounded in the process. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:21:55
I think some of us had a small glimpse of what Bitcoin could become one day and we would do anything (even wiring money to a random bank account in another state or country) for coins!  I wanted to tell friends to buy at that time but I honestly thought that they would all think we were crazy.  I mean, who wires money to random bank accounts for digital money that could be worth something someday?  But as we experienced our first bubble just weeks after our first small purchase in 2013 we had a picture of where this was going.  It was exciting.  It still is, but I feel much more comfortable directing people to Coinbase to purchase.  Less risky for sure, but then I know that in essence Coinbase is holding the coins and that has it's own issues.  But for those that are not as technologically savvy it is the best option for sure I believe.  
But I don't really go out of my way to talk about Bitcoin and have become cautious about advising people to invest.  We told an aunt about it and the price was around $600 and she purchased 7 coins but because it dipped just a little she sold them at a loss.  I feel bad because she just needed a bit more patience, but she decided it was too "risky" I guess. :(  But I have another friend that is VERY happy with our advice right about now.  She is blown away at how well this investment has done.  My brother-in-law is very thankful too.  We gifted him some coins.  A fairly "small" gift is now a very big one as the price has gone up.  He is just holding. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:36:11
Well, he is "into" it too!  He is not as obsessed with the price though.  I am the one that is much more emotional and desire to just hoard them.  I joked yesterday that I am like Gollum:  
Working on not being obsessed.  It really isn't healthy honestly!  
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:39:52
For those of us that were involved since 2013, this was certainly more true then!  Even purchasing Bitcoin was really difficult.  There were no easy exchanges to buy on.  Our first purchase involved us wiring money to Gox.  We didn't trust Mt. Gox so took coins off there (thankfully!) purchased on a another a place called "Bitfloor" I think it was called.  They went under too but did give us our coins back.  It felt like the "wild west" of crypto back then for sure.  
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:49:39
Hopefully he gives you a discount now.  I am thankful for Bitcoin so I can afford counseling!  Seriously!  It isn't cheap.
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:34:53
Well, Coinbase/GDAX is so much better than the options we had in 2013!  I actually advise my friends to just keep coins there because they are not that technologically savvy.  The only reason I don't store all of my coins on there is because I just happen to be married to a software architect and I trust he knows what he is doing.  But I don't trust myself.  I have gotten a virus in the past so I know that I need to let him manage the security aspect of it all.

I was talking with my friend about these same thoughts this morning.  Trying to speculate how high the spike will get on the next bull run.  Would $40K be conservative?   I just want it to get back to $20K at this point though.  
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:55:02
This is finally starting to feel like the 2013 bubbles.  Good times! :)  My husband told me to put away my phone this morning as I kept telling him the price every few minutes.  It is like an addiction when the price moves like this.  I check the price constantly.  I need therapy!
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:56:10
You do realize that purchasing fractions of a coin is an option?  We can invest $1 into BTC at any price.  Of course, the amount of coin that $1 purchases will be less when the price is $40K.  
Having been involved with BTC since 2013, people were saying the exact same thing that you in regards to $1000, $5000.  Certainly $20K was laughed at.  
I was telling my friend on the phone this afternoon, as we were discussing how we had a hard time  comprehending that the price would ever get to $6000 a couple of years ago.  Now for it to stay relatively stable there is impressive as a new floor has obviously been reached.  I believe we will almost certainly see the price rice to $100K by 2020.  We are following an exponential curve with great consistency.  With more investors coming, it will happen.  The question is when?  Maybe by early 2019 even?
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:40:11
Well, it could be worse.  You could be like some of the people I read about on here that mined coins or purchased them and then lost their coins via a hard drive crash or accidentally throwing it out. ;)
I often ponder those that purchase them and then sell them when the price point reaches what they deem is as high as they think it will go to.  For instance, many purchased at $2 and then sold at $10 thinking that was as high as it would go.  Sure, they made great money on that investment but they could have held on for much longer.  So a person purchasing at $3000 but then holding the coins for a few years could perhaps do much better than the person that purchased at $2 then sold too soon if the price increases to $100,000 or more.  This is why I post this plan frequently. This is the investment/divestment plan that my husband and I following and I think it is incredibly helpful for not getting too emotional in this, BTW, if anyone is interested:    It really doesn't matter when a person jumps into BTC as much as just having a long term plan (if we really see BTC as being a truly lasting disruptive new technology which I do of course.)

@_date: 2017-08-06 00:28:48
We haven't invested any alt coins.  As strange as it sounds as I am all for Bitcoin, my husband and I are not really that big of risk takers.  I think Bitcoin is the least risky of all the coins, as it appears to be the one with the most success.  Is it the "best?"  Perhaps not, but it is the most recognized and so far the code has been solid.  We will see where the road leads.  Probably wise to diversify too, but we just haven't. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:09:01
Yes!  Ironically, started going a few weeks ago because my teen daughter has been struggling.  I can at least afford it now! ;)

My husband is now retired (devoting all his time to helping non-profits and ministries) on what you are calling "shitcoins" though.  I would rather he wasn't spending them even now, but I guess he is getting some good use out of them at least.  I would like to think that he owes me a little "thank you" for not only wanting to invest as much as we did, but being resistant to selling them.   But we at least played the game well enough I guess.
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:54:04
This plan can keep anyone from being "like Greg."  My only regret is not following it more precisely:
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:50:12
Having been loosely involved with the BTC community since 2013 (so not 10 years but almost 7 years) it was hard to find a trustworthy way to even purchase Bitcoin back then, and actually my husband and I decided not to purchase for a while because we were not even sure it was legal to buy any.  We waited until there were at least some money laundering laws put into place so we could justify that we felt it was OK.  But it felt like the wild west!
I was pleasantly surprise though when we went to our first Bitcoin meetup recently to see how small the meetup was.  We live in a quite large metropolitan area too, considered one of the more "high tech" places and there were only 30-40 people there!  I left really excited because I realized that we are still so early in this!  For those of us who have been around a while, it seems like Bitcoin isn't that new, but many people are not even aware that money as they know it is completely changing behind the scenes.  It is crazy really.
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:37:16
You must be new here.  ;)
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:46:26
Well, certainly haven't held them all this entire time.  We had a daughter to pay college for, and various other expenses (some medical issues too, when I was in the hospital due to a stroke a few years back.)  Thankful that we could use the investment to pay for these things though.  We have tried to hold a bit for the long haul.  I think it is wise to hold as long as we can if it is doable.
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:17:07
I have been around the bitcoin community for a while (since 2013) but for some reason each time we have a breakout/bubble it still is shocking how fast the price can rise.  This is one area in life where I can say that I hope things don't change! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:22:13
Well, my husband and I have had an open ticket for several months because we had a stop loss order on an Ethereum sale (our first attempt at even dabbling in an alt coin so perhaps we are learning our lesson in that).  We should have been paid over $6000 because the sell price was over $300 but we were paid $0.  Figured it is obvious that we didn't quite get what we are owed?  But then after a couple months Coinbase tech support finally emailed asking for more information/pictures of what we were talking about.  Hubby sent them.  Still nothing.  I would have really liked to reinvest that $6000 earlier.  Sigh.  It feels like our options are limited too.  We have no where better than Coinbase to turn to.  We had some issues with Kraken too.  Tried to move some cash off of there and the transfer never arrived at out bank account.  Finally they put the cash back on our account but we just had to reinvest in coin because the transfers were not working for whatever reason.

I was wondering what was up with the ETF too so came on here to look for some info.  Bummed that it is delayed yet again.  Not too surprising.  I did find this article online that had a very encouraging quote at the end:


From this post: 
We will see what happens I guess.   If they think BTC is "calmer" they are probably in for a surpise though.  It seems calm before it isn't. ;)  Has Bitcoin ever really been that "calm?"  I guess if we look at months, but not at years!
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:13:10
Nice. But when are they going to add the word "OK?"  Two letter words are more useful in Scrabble than "Bitcoin!"  ;)
Edit:  I guess they added "OK" finally???  Should I play my husband at Scrabble again without telling him then play the word and have him challenge me on it?  Hmmmm.  Tempting. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:53:10
Yes. This is the perspective that reminds me that we are all still very early adopters.  I have been involved since early 2013 and there was talk even then that we were late to invest.  However, we really don't know what the limit is on this.  $10,000 seemed unlikely to many a few years ago.  Does $100,000 seem that much of a stretch now?  
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:58:23
Cut your losses if you can just buy back in.  This will go way past 20K in month or two.
Hubby and I had to sell a bit yesterday to pay some bills, so I understand.  Would buy back if we had the spare cash but we have delayed, delayed, delayed selling for months now.  Just selling as needed.  It is what it is.  But we hold as much as we can for as long as we can.  It is just part of the fun. ;)
@_date: 2019-06-20 00:10:29
I had a dream we broke through resistance and then shot straight to 1 Million per BTC last night.  I woke up rather disappointed. ;) LOL 
I do think that once we hit the 10K point again it won't stay there long, however.
Edit:  The Winklevoss twins agree that if we hit 10K we are going straight to 15K.  I think this is true:  
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:34:57
Regardless of what was discussed and how it was received, the fact that the discussion is even taking place at events like these are what is important.  Bitcoin is being taken much more seriously than it used to be.

My husband wants to sell BTC for a Tesla (car not the stock!)  He has the nicest car in our family too (Mercedes CLA) so not sure why he needs the upgrade?  Guys and their 'toys' I guess?  At least he has said he is waiting until the price of a tesla = 1BTC.

Welcome to the fun ride.  Many of us, when we really studied what made Bitcoin have value and worth, realized this is most likely a game changer in the world of all finance.  So it makes sense to throw in as much as we could possibly afford to lose thinking we are getting in fairly early on what is kind of like the start of the internet.  
Here is a valuable page to study on how to navigate this investment as I think it is the wisest one out there.   My main regret so far is not keeping to it 100%.  (Also, not buying a Trezor sooner, as we had a major hacking scare that then led us to purchase back what we sold at a very high price and thus not keeping with the investment plan. )
I think those of us who have been around a while realize that everyone deals with the "would have, should have and could have" kind of thoughts in regards to this investment.  It is a crazy ride.  My advice to all is to just get on the ride and have a plan in place to ride it on all the bumps that will come and go.  It isn't boring, that is for sure!
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:08:52

I guess I avoided an awkward one on Thursday.  My husband's aunt invested at around $600 a couple years ago (purchased 7 coins) but when the price dipped a bit she got nervous and insisted he sell for her.  (She couldn't set up her own account for whatever reason).  My husband tired to convince her to wait it out a bit longer.  He said it was a more long term investment really and said she should wait a couple years at least but she was upset she lost a bit and made him sell for her and said she didn't want him to argue with her.  So yesterday she was probing a bit wanting to know how we were doing.  She had heard the price was over $8000 now and then lamenting that she didn't listen to him.  But then the subject changed when another family member arrived.  I keep thinking we should just give my aunt the $1K she lost, but then I am frustrated because I told her to wait too and she didn't listen to me either so I guess it wasn't our fault. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 16:11:00
I think many people just do not like change.  This is why Bitcoin will be the most beneficial at first for those that have very little choices in payment options.

The part that stands out to me the most is in the Wall Street section:




Are we ready for that wild ride?  I was just thinking that compared to the two bubbles in 2013 we still haven't quite reached the same kind of crazy increase.  I seem to remember the price doubling in a single day.
This chart was interesting at the end too:
The "Fairly Valued" price for BTC being $153,955 in December of 2018?  Seems hard to believe, but then considering the thought of Wall Street becoming involved, maybe not so far fetched.  
I think I am looking forward to 2018.  :)

My husband's Mercedes CLA is somewhat "self driving" and it is creepy to me.  But he is fascinated with the technology around autonomous driving vehicles and really wants a Tesla because they seem to be on the cutting edge of that kind of technology.  Hard to imagine a world where the cars are safer to ride in when they are being driven by a computer instead of a human, but then again, with the way I see some drivers on the road maybe not a bad direction to go in?

My husband and I were telling all our friends and family to buy Bitcoin when the price was $100.  Unfortunately, this was before Coinbase, or other more reputable exchanges were around.  One friend purchased 10 BTC on Mt. Gox.  My husband told him to get all of his coins off of there when he suspected there were problems.  His friend didn't listen and well, those coins are gone now (but his friend doesn't blame him.)
Then my husband's brother purchased 2 coins (and we gifted him one as well) Because of the Mt. Gox fiasco right around that time, my husband insisted his brother keep all his coins offline in his own wallet.  Now his brother can't find his password.  (and his brother wouldn't give my husband a copy to hold on to because he didn't want to.)  No password, no coins.  :(  His brother isn't mad, but now my husband is saying that he wants to make it up to his brother somehow.  So now it is our problem?  Hmmm.  Oh well. 
Then there were some that we told to buy, especially when Coinbase started.  Two friends listened.  Two friends are VERY happy with us now. ;)  But I am to the point now I don't really tell anyone to buy.  It is up to them. We have seen how it can go bad, unfortunately, and I don't want to be blamed for that in the end.  If they beg us to know more information, we tell them of course.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:51:04
You do know you can purchase fractions of a BTC right?  If you have $10 you can buy in.  In fact, my husband gave out Christmas gits of $10 worth of BTC at the company he used to work for.  One friend had forgotten about it but then called him up a couple of weeks ago and said, "Hey, thanks for the $100!  I have been buying lunch on you all week."  His friend should have just kept the BTC.  But hey, at least the $10 gift was worth more.

People laughed at the thought of $1000 and $10,000 seemed ridiculous to many.  
I posted on Bitcointalk a few years ago that people seem to become so hung up on the risk of investing in BTC but they never consider the risk of not investing.  $1mill per coin could and I believe will happen, especially as institutional money begins to pour in.  There is is a limited supply of coins, just keep that in mind, and people will continue to hoard them as the price rises too.  
I advise having a plan in place though such as this one:  
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:56:50
My husband and I used to tell people about Bitcoin all the time in 2013 and even 2014.  But most of our friends and family just thought we were a little crazy and taking too great a risk. We have only had a few friends/family invest because of our advice.  One backed completely out because the price dipped and she felt like it was not going anywhere.  However, the other two are pretty happy with our advice now!  One purchased some at around $400 and the other at $600.  
But I don't even tell anyone about it now honestly.  I think having so many people tell me I was "crazy" was frustrating.   
@_date: 2015-08-22 06:00:05
Is this your first Bitcoin investment?  Did you already have some holdings?  If so, when did you first purchase them?  I think it is a great time to jump in, BTW.  Well done.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:05:41
There have been some "bumps in the road" for sure.  I guess the fact that we are still in the game is the "well done" or perhaps the mercy of God.  We had a scare where we thought our coins were hacked, as there was some sort of virus we didn't know about on our computer that was changing the address coin was being sent to behind the scenes.  We were miraculously able to get the coins back when it was discovered we did an accidental "double spend."  Long story, (shared it over on another sub when it happened and here is the story if you are interested:  ) but we went and bought a trezor and are now much more careful.  But it hasn't been boring for sure! ;)

I guess "people" can be blamed for voting for someone that they like, like Chavez, but in general the people have very little control over many aspects of how a government is run.

It will catch up to us one day too.

$22K  is really conservative.  We will probably hit that within a month or two. I honestly think we will see at least $40K by year end.  If we have bubbles like the past, maybe even touching $100K on this run.  But with Bitcoin we never really know for sure.  I am just glad we are heading in a more bullish direction.  I keep thinking that we will no longer have these bubbles followed by year long dips.

In our marriage I have been the one who wants to buy more and never sell!  I'm the Bitcoin hoarder.  Not that my husband doesn't want to sell some, but I lament that he has a much more low risk strategy.  We sold a huge amount at the beginning of the last bubble at $600.  :( If we had just waited a week or two that price was so much higher. I had no say at all in the choice either.  He was determined that we were going to pay of all the debt (and he also wanted to treat his brother to a birthday trip to Vegas to see a UFC fight.  So there was that!)  Oh well...  What is the point of BTC I guess if we are just hoarding it all and not enjoying it a little?  I wouldn't have even heard of Bitcoin or thought to invest if he hadn't tole me about it.

Our dog doesn't agree.  
We asked our dog if we should sell right now or hodl and the sign to sell would be if she said, "woof." (My husband and I were debating this as the price is the highest it has been in several months.  I always say hodl as long as possible but I have been wrong.  But then he has been wrong and sold too soon at times.)
Our Basset hound clearly told us to hodl! (She didn't bark!)  This is great because if she is wrong, she is the the "dog house" and not my husband this time. ;)

This is a great time to buy.  Anyone who has purchased BTC and held longer than a couple years has done really well, regardless of when they purchased so keep that in mind.  But here is the best advice I have found on this investment to date.  The only regrets my husband and I have are not following it even more closely than we have (sold a greater percentage earlier on and not holding as much long term) but still thankful that we have done well with it.  It does take patience though:

My thinking is that there would be some price manipulation by whales to make more off the contracts they control.  When expired they pump the price back up?  Not sure but it is a theory.  Obviously nit a good one as I can see now as the price is tanking even more.  
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:18:09

I had a dream last night. In the dream I was in an airport and there was only one store to shop in while waiting for my connecting flight.  I was surprised because the store only took Bitcoin. Many people were shopping there too.  There were Bitcoin logos everywhere and much of the products there were "bitcoin" related (Bitcoin pillows, stickers, blankets, t-shirts, etc. . . ) I was thinking, "That is strange.  Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream now."  
Today the price rises.  Interesting.  
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:06:20


But so does any currency.  Look at Venezuela.  To think that USD or any other currency is risk free is just burying our heads in the sand.  But this doesn't mean that diversifying isn't a bad idea.  The question is what is the best place to do so though?


My husband and I tried to get some coins off of cold storage to sell too but then didn't realize we had a hidden virus that swapped out BTC addresses.  It is really a miracle we got our coins back.  (Super long story but here is a link if anyone is interested:    )
Now we are waiting for the price to bounce back.  So annoying it is taking months.  I just hope we don't have another long three or four years to wait for a bubble though!

@_date: 2018-11-20 19:21:20
Right. I have been involved with BTC since 2013.  This is just so painfully typical now.  My biggest regret is thinking each time that it will somehow be different when so far it is just the same old bubble cycle over and over and over.  Could have taken advantage of this so much better if we hadn't thought much of our investment was hacked after the price hit $19K (long story).  We purchased back in the amount we thought was hacked just to stay in the game if the price kept going up.  FOMO will bite us all if we let it.  
Regardless, holders unite!  Hodlers have never regretted hodling with BTC so far.

With Coinbase a person can actually have coins sent to any address, so absolutely!  I am surprised that Robinhood can supposedly "sell" coins without the option of the person purchasing them gaining access to them.  It seems shady.

 My husband pointed this out to me several years ago when we first purchased BTC, that it was a new technology and would follow the logistical S curve like other new technologies. How that translates into the price of BTC is what is more fascinating to me as an investor.  
Because I was already aware of Bitcoin following the new technology S curve, this was the most fascinating quote to me in this article.  I had not thought about how other technologies are limited to just one item per person (one cellphone or two per user) but Bitcoin is not limited by just one per user, making it an even greater investment in that regard:

I am sure people take out loans to buy BTC but we just might need a bit more for our taxes as we don't know the exact amount we owe yet.  Our tax bill will be brutal as we sold high, thought some were hacked so purchased back in (got our coins back.  Long story but didn't want to be out of the game with the coins we thought we lost) then the price dropped and we purchased a bit more.  We made a good amount on our sale at $19,200 BUT we still have to pay taxes on thousands of extra income this past year and now we are mostly back in coin and not cash.  First world problems I guess...

Could it be that the sell off is  partially due to many of us needing some cash to pay taxes?  I know my husband and I have been delaying even filing because it will be a hefty bill.   We held some cash to pay, but might still need a bit more.  Really don't want to sell any coins right now though. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:44:46
We probably won't sell any coins either, just use equity line.  A bit risky but I guess it is ALL risky!  LOL ;) I am getting quite used to high risk after being involved with BTC since 2013.

Sounds like you are in the perfect place to be then!  A job you like plus added savings on the side. :)  My husband actually really likes his job right now too.  I am relieved of that because during the 2013 bubble he wasn't happy at his job at that point and was seriously dreaming of what it would be like if BTC took off.  He even made a chart of what the price would need to be to retire.  But considering that we need medical benefits, plus the basic cost of living to consider, and the expense of two kids, we really need to be careful that we have a considerable amount.  I am not even sure how much we would need.  I haven't punched the numbers.  But he makes well over six figures in his job now and being in Southern California our cost of living is fairly high.  We would need at least $10,000 a month just to keep the standard of living we currently have.  We are not reaching retirement age yet either for another couple of decades, so there is that too.  So I just hope he wants to at least work until the kids are out of college and married and then we can think about other things. I work too, but just part time so it doesn't affect me as much as it does him.  
I do also really want to go on more mission trips and BTC doing well could help fund that too!  :)  Planning on going back to India next Summer actually.

Well, the wisest place to store our treasures is in Heaven, where rust and moth cannot destroy.
But if we look at history, we should think that if USD could collapse in 1929, are we really that much wiser now?  Honestly? China, Russia, and many other countries are already working towards moving away from the dollar as the standard.  The writing is already on the wall as far as I am concerned.  Granted, if USD goes down, everything else most likely goes with it.  But trading gold for goods would be rather cumbersome and not practical.  I do believe BTC will have greater value than gold in this case.
All that said, the funny thing about Bitcoin is that many of us only invested an amount we could safely lose ALL of.  Then, surprisingly, if we hodl'ed long enough that amount is now the largest investment we have.  What do we do with it then?  Is it really wise to move it to something else since it has already outperformed any other investment in our lives?  I say holding some long term is the obvious choice.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:19:00
Bitcoin is a wild ride.  I am not losing any sleep about the price returning to it's ATH, even though there are a few things I am hoping to do with the funds once it hits that price again.  When it will get back there is more the question.  Having been involved since 2013, I can tell you that sometimes it is faster than we think, often it is slower.  Bitcoin requires patience and an iron stomach.  ;)
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:47:13
When my husband said basically this same thing to me in 2013 I decided we needed Bitcoin and needed to hodl them!  Unfortunately we had to sell quite a bit as we over-purchased after the 2013 bubbles, but we at least held some.  
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:36:03
Every time the price doubles we sell 10% of the remaining holdings. This allows for the investment to be recouped early yet hodling long term, as we don't really know how high the price will actually go.  This is basically the "Sane and Simple Bitcoin Savings" plan from this wise bitcointalk.com user:

$15,000 could happen on this run.  Get a plan in place I guess.  If you don't really like your job that much it will be nice to have the freedom to do whatever brings you joy for sure!
I want to go back to the studio to record some songs I have written.  I can be a "struggling artist" much easier when I don't have to worry about making any money at it. ;)  We will see though. I am not sure if it is even necessary now.  I can just throw some home recordings up online too.  But I will have that freedom it I decide which is nice for sure. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:10:01
Yes.  Also, Bitcoin is so much more stable now compared to when the price was only $2.  The network has grown so much since even 2013.  But then my husband argues that there are more people involved which should keep the price more steady but I somehow think that we can still see the same jumps we saw in 2013.  We will see though.  It won't take long now.  I am guessing if we are entering a bubble the price will start to climb like crazy the next week or two and $10,000 or even $15,000 won't be out of reach and can even happen within days.  I am thankful that I am less emotional about it all now though.  2013 was a crazy ride!  I was way too obsessed with Bitcoin then.  Now I am only mildly obsessed.  But if the price does get to $10,000?  Who knows. I hope I am older and wiser now!  LOL 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:27:31
My husband wants to retire too!  I think we will need a $100,000 BTC for that to happen though!  With the cost of college for our kids and the probability of two weddings to pay for (we have two daughters) there will need to be a good amount saved up first.  Plus we have a house to pay off, his car, the list goes on and on.  How do people afford all of this without Bitcoin is my question?  ;)

Right!?  That is funny actually.  We have an open ticket since last Summer!  I will have to keep this in mind perhaps, or just let the $6000 they own us go.  They responded once with an email needing more information to which my husband sent the screenshots of how we were paid "$0" for a stop loss ETF order.  Then nothing.  
I keep thinking they will hire enough people at some point to improve customer service.  Hasn't happened yet.  The price of bitcoin keeps going up so I just console myself with that and figure the loss is part of the fun of being trailblazers on this new adventure.

Many of the most important things with the most value in this life are "illogical."  Love is illogical so even if someone thinks faith is illogical, it doesn't mean it isn't valuable.  But regardless, I think faith is actually more logical than not.  I had a long conversation with a Hindu once.  He said, "all paths are valid."  I said that Jesus said, "I am the way the truth and the life and no one can come to the Father except through Me."  If Jesus is the way to eternal life, and Hinduism says that all paths are valid, wouldn't the logical decision be to become a Christian?  He couldn't argue with my point.  The same could hold true for Atheism.  If Atheists are right then it really doesn't matter in the end if a Christian agrees or disagrees, does it?  But let's say the Christians are correct and that there is a God and we are accountable to Him for our choices, or acceptance or rejection of Him here on earth, the Atheist stands to suffer for eternity for that decision.  So "logically" following Jesus makes great sense.

Living in California my entire life, many people do try to move to more affordable locations.  My sister and brother-in-law bought a cheap house about an hour away from Los Angeles almost two decades ago.  They wanted to own their own home and stop paying rent.  My sister was able to find a job near their home (it's a really nice one BTW) but my brother-in-law was never able to find as good of a job and had to keep the one he had.  He still has it and commutes over an hour each way, every single day!  It is taxing on the family and even their finances.  He has resorted to taking the train to commute most of the way, so he can at least read or sleep.  But it is a lifestyle choice my husband and I were not willing to make. There are far more jobs for my husband in IT closer to the City but the homes are far more expensive.  Our house is about half the size as my sister's and brother-in-law's home, actually worth almost twice as much now though (it wasn't when we purchased it 19 years ago)  We could sell it and pay cash for a home elsewhere with the equity, but the jobs are here and commuting is exhausting.  
Our daughter is getting married and moving to Washington state in a week.  We are seriously contemplating moving there someday, especially because there is no state income tax there either.  So, we will see down the road.  But right now we have many commitments here.  The cost of living is really high though.  It is tight on an over six figure income, strangely.

The timing for this is interesting to me.  Perhaps it coincides with the launch of the BIT Fund next week?  The BIT shares price are said to be 1/10 of the price of a coin so it might be strategic to make the default unit smaller.  
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:38:03
Right!  Then I ask God "Why?" Granted, we thought we had several coins hacked but they were rather miraculously saved (long story) so my husband and I told God that they were His to do what He willed with.  So if the price is low, I shouldn't worry about it. As far as we are concerned they are not really ours now as we have given them to God.  I would just like to see them back at almost $20K.

We haven't lost a dime.  First purchases were early 2013.  Experienced a couple bubbles.  Sold some coins off to be in the green no matter what happens.  But I still regret not buying when they were $1.  We were just not sure about the legality of BTC in 2011 and 2012.  When there were some money laundering laws put into place we were more confident and decided to dabble a bit with BTC then.   But why do I need to explain myself?  
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:10:30

Didn't Warren Buffett say, "Keep all your eggs in one basket but then watch that basket closely?" 
I think many people don't consider the risks of not investing when the opportunity rises. Yes it is a bit more risky and Bitcoin has been volatile, but the infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin is stronger than ever. I am watching my basket closely and I am feeling very happy that I have a large portion of my investment (which is still small compared to some though) in BTC.

Also, what is so horrible about our thoughts being "clouded?"  Christians typically are the ones that are trying to do good in the world.  Many of the worlds non-profits are faith based.  Christians, out of love for humanity because of the Love God has shown us have started and continue to fund orphanages, hospitals, programs for feeding the hungry and medical missions and so on.  Is it so horrible that this has "clouded" our minds to the point that we want to love others?  
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:29:28
I am aware of Pascal's Wager.  I understand that in reality, if an Atheist did try to "will" themselves into being a Christian, the truth is that they wouldn't really be serving Christ anyway, so it is in a way completely pointless for them to do so.  Many people that claim they are "Christians" are in essence doing that very thing in a way.  Some are trying to be good on their own and earn their way to heaven by good works, but really salvation is all about realizing our sinful state, accepting Christ and His sacrifice for our sins, and then continuously praying and seeking God's help in becoming more like Christ.   The "good works" need to come from a place of gratitude and humility, not pride of how great we are.
And yes, with my argument I am assuming that the Christian path is the truth.  It is hard for me not to be so convinced.  Having had numerous miracles in my life, I know and have no doubt at all.  Someone could hold a gun to my head and say that I needed to denounce Christ or they would pull the trigger and I would say pull it.  I believe that much.
So why do I come on threads like this?  Why do I try to have discussions where I am ridiculed, called illogical, unintelligent, etc?  Reddit isn't the most friendly place to Christians, if you haven't yet noticed. ;)  If I believe Jesus to be true, and God to be real, and that He cares about all of humanity, then I need to try and tell others about Him.  
It often feels like I am on a giant plateau with a huge cliff surrounding it.  People are wearing blindfolds and walking towards the edge of the cliff.  I have, by God's grace, had my blindfold removed and can see things for what they are.  I tell people that they are walking towards a cliff.  They respond, "There is no cliff.  How can there be a cliff if I do not believe in it.  This plateau is all there is.  You are crazy for thinking that there is a cliff.  Scientists have proven there is no cliff."  I can try to reason with them but it doesn't really work, usually.  Then I pray.  I pray that God will somehow draw them to Him.  I pray that His Spirit will speak to their soul.  I pray that they will someday have the "blindfold" removed so that they can see things differently than they do now, and I pray that they will be completely overwhelmed by God's love for them, first and foremost.  It is God's love and His kindness that draws us to want to repent.

Right! That was a long 3 years!  As someone who did hodl through it does make it painful to buy on these dips!  But that didn't stop my husband and I from buying again this morning.  Just have to keep some funds available for taxes and a few other projects we are contributing to.  We could certainly sell coin and still be in the black but knowing it was worth more makes it hard to sell at what seems like a loss. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:46:51
Thanks. :)
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:31:03
Investing in Bitcoin has made investing in charities almost necessity when selling.  I appreciate the tax deductions for sure!

Many people that are laughing now will be crying later for not really investigating Bitcoin further.  Some of us are already crying knowing we could have bought some at $1 or less.

I love Jesus and Bitcoin.  Glad Jesus is first, that is the way it should be.  :)
But the more I think about it, I am not supposed to love both God and 'money.' Bitcoin is still technically 'money.' But my husband and I did think we lost all our Bitcoin in a hack, and I just told him I loved him anyway.  So hopefully that is a sign I am holding onto it loosely enough.  But still a little more obsessed than I should be.  Hmmmm.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:03:38
For those of us who have been around for several years we have experienced these prolonged dips many times.  The question isn't will we bounce back but really when.  It is often much longer than I would like. Patience is a virtue and necessary to do really well in this investment.  I am fairly confident we won't have to wait years this time, just a month or two.  I am honestly thinking that many are selling off to pay taxes.  My husband and I just finished doing ours today.  We had kept a sizable amount on the side to pay them and still need to dip into some of our equity line as it was worse than we even thought, mostly because of our California State taxes.  We didn't calculate them and they were almost half of the federal!  Our daughter might move to Oregon because her boyfriend lives there in a couple years.  Maybe we should join her!  I think they don't have state taxes from what I heard.  Never had the major reasons we have now to really look into that!
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:58:25
Same here!  So complicated this year too as we started a non-profit we need to file on as well and my husband doesn't want to use the "first in-first out" type accounting for the purchase/sale of BTC so that is another situation.  Also, we have another side business with foreign exchange students living with us so I have had to spend some hours entering receipts into a spreadsheet.  We made the most money this past year that we have ever made, reinvested much of it back into BTC, but still have to pay the taxes on that as income so it will be interesting.  Praying we have enough cash in our account to cover it all.  We usually get thousands back from the IRS each year so this makes it even more depressing to file...  Oh, and coinbase said we made $6000 on a ETH sale (we dabbled in it a bit) but then there was a glitch where we were paid $0 for the stop loss order.  Not sure what happened.  We have had an open ticket for months now but then still need to pay short term capital gains on $6000 we never even received.  My husband contacted them and they said that we were going to be "moved up" on the list to close the open ticket.  With Coinbase maybe that means before the end of the year or something?  ;)  As if it wasn't depressing enough not even getting the cash.  Fun times.
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:28:24
I am with you.  I can feel it.  It is like the spring is tightening.  How tight can it get?  I have felt this before.  It is like déjà vu.  Maybe being involved since 2013 has taught me something?  Not sure.  Just hodl- I have learned that at least. ;)
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:53:56
This plan has been great and my only regret is not sticking with it 100%.  We would have even more coin/cash if we had been careful to follow fully.  But we thought we had some coins hacked so wanted to buy back this time.  Kept some cash out.  But still it really is the wisest plan to have (basically selling 10% of BTC holdings each time the price doubles, with option to buy back on dips.) 
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:27:03
Hodler checking in. :)  I had a dream early this morning that I checked the price and said, "Wow. It is at $40K!"  But then I looked at the price again and noticed there were more zeros.  It was actually $40 million!  Nice dream!  At least the price is going in the right direction! 
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:11:44
For those of us that were around in 2013 or earlier, trust me when I tell you that "realistic predictions" are something you learn to throw out the window when you are waking up each morning to the price doubling overnight!

That verse just randomly came up last night as my husband and I were reading.  We had just had our tax return rejected though because our daughter checked the wrong box as "independent" even though she is "dependent."  (As a college kid I guess she thinks she is on her own now or something?  My husband's idea was for her to learn how to file taxes herself.  Maybe not such a good idea yet?) So this verse I guess was funny in that we were trying to render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's!  I just wish it was easier to do so!  Had to mail in an amended tax return for our daughter so we could file ours.  Fun.  And it was WAY more than we have ever had to pay thanks to BTC.  Good problem, but still painful.
@_date: 2018-04-18 23:25:35
I would just throw in all 10K ASAP into Bitcoin.  Of course, I am a long term hodler so keep that in mind.  Read this investment plan though and consider it: (This plan has served my husband and me very well.  Our only regrets is not following it even more fully)

I might have to sell quite a bit this week or next week.  My reason?  I am going on a mission trip and need to pay for the expenses.  Unusual reason I guess?  I keep delaying selling as long as possible though.

Some of us who purchased in 2013 had a few years of 'hell'.  I was just hoping we didn't have to wait that long for a bounce.  Things are looking promising that we won't, thankfully.

I was in India a couple years ago (on a short term mission trip with an amazing organization called Harvestindia.org) and I was amazed at how, even in more rural areas of India, everyone had cell phones.  But banking was an issue.  I knew even then that Bitcoin would be such a valuable thing for India if it became more widely adopted there.  So I am not at all surprised by this fact.  It will be great to see how the adoption of Bitcoin in India helps the country make progress towards higher standards of living for all.

So glad you had the wisdom to use Bitcoin.  I am not too surprised to read this, as I have been reading up on the situation in Venezuela for a while now.  It angers me that there isn't more being done to help.  I hope more people read this and are able to find other ways around all the controls there. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:44:22
I still second guess myself though.  As a long time holder it does help with less emotion on the ups and downs, BUT my husband always seems to sway me with the graphs that show the adoption curve skyrocketing and never going down again.  Each time we have a huge rise he said, "We are never going back down" and I want to believe him.  But then it is a repeat of the same bubble cycle, yet at a higher price thankfully! We are forever in the "black" at this point, but bought back much too soon this time around.  Oh well.  It is a fun ride for adrenaline junkies!  ;)
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:28:21

But some of us did get "rich" quick. ;)
OK, not that I am rich by any means, but for those of us that decided to dabble in BTC in early 2013 it was pretty crazy how fast the price rose. My only regret was not investing more when the price rose. Sure, it fell fast too but there are times when this investment has surprised us.  The best advice is to only invest what you are willing to lose, but for those that like to gamble a bit, I think it is certainly a great idea to at least have a share in this.  
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:47:18
Just curious, but is the Gemini exchange something that needed to be opened before the ETF is allowed to be launched?  As great as the exchange is, I think the ETF is what is really going to be a game changer for BTC.  I know that there might be rules as to why no comment can be made on this.

Welcome to Bitcoin.  It certainly feels like an "investment" when the price is rising.  However, there have been days, months, years, when I questioned the wisdom of "investing" at all.  But the bubbles are certainly a fun ride.  :)

The twins are always a bit low-key it seems during interviews.  I think it isn't necessarily a bad thing though.  I think people might trust them more because of that, and they certainly are not the personality to be swayed or driven by emotions, which is a VERY good thing when it comes to BTC!  ;)

I think besides the earliest people that were mining bitcoin, most of us deal with the "would have's, should have's and could have's" in regards to BTC.  The best thing to do is to buy ASAP in these bubbles, but then be wise and have a good plan.  Here is a link to what I consider the best advice as far as investing in BTC I have ever encountered. 
I am so much less emotional about Bitcoin now than I used to be. The last bubble in 2013 I was seriously obsessed and not in a good way and we were not able to capitalize on any of the gains and then my husband and I found ourselves basically having too much of our money tied up in BTC but not wanting to sell at a loss, which led to some very lean years.  But we are coming out of that now at least!  Yay!  :) 
@_date: 2015-10-09 20:51:56
When you think about the fact that most people in the world will never have the chance to own that large of a share of BTC, if and when it takes off to the level many are predicting, own just 1 BTC is a pretty big deal. :)  
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:32:06
Bitcoin stable?  Thanks for this post. A post like this will cause the price to change 5....4....3....2....
But seriously,  not an expert by any means but involved with BTC for over 2 years now, Bitcoin will find moments of what feels like "stability" only to surprise us all.  We are well over due for a new and exciting bubble cycle at this point, I strongly believe. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:40:52

They might be a bit too intelligent to relate to general population perhaps.  I think they do a great job of trying to simplify the concept for most people to understand.  But I think anyone with any investment in BTC should be very thankful for having such great guys providing a professional "face" or should I say "faces" for the Bitcoin community. :)  I am a fan!

@_date: 2015-10-06 16:11:20
Hopefully those that try to short BTC will feel the pain of doing so.  But this was my concern too.  We didn't have this option available during the other bubbles so it will be interesting to see what happens during the next one.

For years my husband and I have kept track of our kids allowance on my cell phone.  I just use a notepad and keep track that way so that I always have my phone with me when they want to spend something.  But Bitcoin would be pretty cool and an easier way to give them their allowance for sure.  It is just that it isn't taken everywhere yet.  One of these days. :)

It seems that Gemini was a necessary exchange providing a way for institutional funds to be moved in and out of it as a precursor to the ETF launch.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:34:44
No day trading.  I learned pretty quickly that the best way to make money in BTC is just to buy, hodl and have a plan in place to sell without being too emotional, and buying back on some of the dips if the price goes low enough.
I remember during the last bubble we were freaking out when the price went up $100 in a day. I vaguely remember then that the conversation was that during the next bubble we would see $100 increases in minutes and sure enough, here we are!  Crazy.

Too bad Andreas  isn't Satoshi.  I think if Gavin said he was everyone would just happily agree and not even ask him to prove it!
I must admit I am a bit surprised that Gavin seemed to believe Craig was Satoshi.  Gavin always seemed very intelligent.  But then I was thinking maybe Gavin is just agreeing as a decoy?  Perhaps He knows something we don't know?  Just speculating.

Your timing of investment is much wiser than many if that is the case! 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:55:52
It was risky!  We had a little coin on MtGox.  Thankfully hubby pulled most out before the crash as he saw the "writing on the wall."  I tried day trading which was hilariously bad, but a learning experience for me!  The bubbles are so euphoric you find yourself wanting to pour in all the cash you have as you see the price rising, but the problem is these bubbles are like waves.  It is good to get in ASAP (I still think now is fine, but as the price gets closer to $4000 and $5000 or even a bit higher, people will be going mad to pour cash in and then it will pop and then the long and painful wait until the next bubble begins.  That is just how BTC works, until we reach full market capitalization which we have not yet.) 
It is a fun ride though.  Just jump on board with what you can afford to lose!  LOL  ;)  Chances are if you hold long enough you won't lose anything at all!  I am long term "hodler" and now glad to say that.  
@_date: 2015-10-09 03:23:53

Although we have the capabilities to produce offspring, some of which may have some greater levels of intelligence than the mating couple, that does not mean we were the originators of that intelligence in the beginning.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:55:15
Absolutely.  He was, and is, and is to come. One proof is in the existence of intelligence.  To even have intelligence the "designer" needed to be more intelligent than the person (or thing) the designer made.  The code in our DNA is so complex that a more intelligent being needed to "program" us to work the way that we do, as well as all the order of how organisms interact with each other in the universe. For this to "magically" occur without any intelligent designer behind it is not logical. Therefore, there is a higher being that put the ability to think, create, design things ourselves (including Bitcoin).

In my very early 40's. (Thankful for the early part) ;)  I think that there is definitely some wisdom that only comes with age.  We are acutely aware of how fast some things can change when it comes to new technology.  I think "kids" in their teens and early 20's don't quite "get it" in some ways.  The growth from the 80's to 90's was probably more impressive than that from 2000 to 2015, IMHO.

I personally do not think we have hit the top of this run yet. I have always been bullish though since I saw firsthand what BTC could do in 2013.  I think we are just plateauing a bit now and will see a rise to $6000 to $9000.  Then the "return to normal" will ensue and we repeat the cycle again.

At least this one has the potential to make money instead of lose it. :)  It can be really crazy though.  I experienced both bubbles in 2013 and could not wrap my brain around how fast the price could rise.  It becomes very tempting to buy more as the price increases but it is wise to try to remain "unemotional" about it all.  The price falls are a bit more depressing but I think you are pretty much in at the bottom of what it is going to be from here on out, so great timing in buying.  
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:04:56
My husband certainly hopes so.  Don't get me wrong, I am all for that too, but he has already warned me that when he can purchase a Tesla for the price of 1BTC he is planning on doing that.  Really?

It is great to see that you are still holding most of the coins that were donated to you by the Bitcoin community.  I hope the price increases soon and you can enjoy some of the profit from that.  Do you have any plans if and when we have another bubble?

How about two or three months?  We jumped over $1000 in a single day already and this bull run is just barely getting started.   
I have found that when BTC bubbles, the rise in price is shocking for everyone.  I seriously expect the price peak to be around $80K to $90K by the end of Summer.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:16:22


It probably depends on how it is discussed.  When I start the conversation by saying, "I didn't want to sell! Why did you insist?" it leads to some pent up frustration that way I am sure!  LOL
But healthy communication is certainly a good thing to work towards.  And I would say that generally my husband and I are good communicators, but buying and selling Bitcoin could lead many relatively happy couples to argue I think. ;)  At least when we thought we may have had the rest of our investment hacked (there was some hidden virus that swapped out the blockchain address when we tried to send some coin over to Coinbase last year even though we double checked the address to make sure it looked correct) It was rather intense.  I told my husband I didn't blame him for that, as he has tried to be so careful.  He was even wise enough to get our coins off of Mt.Gox just a few weeks before it went down as he could see it was not going well.  
Bitcoin is not boring and it isn't for the feint of heart.  ;)
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:33:54
This is the same kind of rhetoric that I have heard since 2013.  But regardless, we have had bubble cycles that have been what so many would call "unhealthy" or not working.  Is BTC heavily under-priced?  I think so, especially given all the news on the horizon (ETF approval, Fidelity, etc...)  Will people overbuy again and how much this time?  I could be way off.  It might get up to $150K.  I seem to remember talk of a "super bubble" that happened in 2011 or 2012.  It was more than 10x an increase.
Time will tell though.  It should be a fun ride. :)
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:38:30
I concur.  Why so many think that history won't repeat itself is puzzling to me?  Past behavior predicts future behavior and so far Bitcoin hasn't disappointed.

Why not have a long term plan in place in case the price keeps rising? How high will it eventually go?  Will you regret selling it all at 20K if the price gets to 300K in a year or two?  This long term plan is a great one:
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:32:44
I think the 1% was anyone who had ever used it, so not even those who are using it now.  
Side story: I was chatting with my new neighbor yesterday and he said his brother used to have a drug problem and purchased some bitcoin years ago to use on the silk road, couldn't figure out how to transfer it so just left them in the wallet.  He looked it up last year when the price skyrocketed and then sold all of the 20 coins he had there to pay off his college debt.  He isn't using bitcoin anymore, but he did once.

I have spent time in rural parts of India.  At least half of the people there seem to have cell phones and are on the internet!  Do they have running water?  No.  But they have cell phones.  So weird.

Is there any news or speculation that Binance is purchasing back those 7000 coins?  I was wondering if that is part of what is fueling this pump?

I have been to rural India a couple of times and most people there have cell phones somehow.  They don't have running water, but they have phones with internet.  It is really weird.

He has reasons.  The logic was that we shouldn't put all our hope in Bitcoin and at that point had credit card debt that was affecting our credit score somewhat negatively (although it was only marginal and we have a 750 score so I am not sure why he was that worried. 
 And we had a very low interest rate and could have moved balance over to a home equity line) But it just leads to frustration when I say it would have been better to just leave a balance on the card and keep the coins a little longer.  Sigh.  Marriage is a journey of making compromises it seems.  We didn't sell all our investment.  But it was a painful amount now that I look back and do the math for sure!

People still doubt.  Things haven't changed all that much.

I was there when this was posted.  My bitcointalk account got hacked though since then sadly so I don't go on there now.  Oh well.  
Those early days were like the wild west for sure.  I keep thinking things have changed. I guess they have a little?  I still think holding/hodling is the way to go.  I admit I haven't been perfect at holding but I blame my husband for that as he was the one that wanted to sell off a bunch at $300 and $600!  So painful now.  He didn't want to have any more debt.  I try not to bring it up.  It just leads to a fight.

As a long term "hodler" (was even there at the inception of that word actually on Bitcointalk) I concur with this.  My husband and I are sticking with this divestment plan too, as it makes great logical sense:

Yes.  Risto was a classic early adopter.  A brilliant mind but really eccentric.  I "friended" him a bit outside of Bitcointalk but he kind of got off (into drugs and had some other legal issues) Not sure if he changed his social media because I am no longer "friends" there.  I thought it would be fun to visit his castle one day.  Didn't know it burned until I googled him this morning though. :(  He hasn't had the easiest life for sure ( failed marriage, bunch of conspiracies of his fear of being followed, mental illness and hospitalization, etc. . .)  He also donated a coin to me back when the price was around $600 per BTC and it went towards humanitarian/mission work I was doing.  (used that coin and more when I went to India last year)
But my husband and I owe this man a huge "thank you!"  We figured if he was wise enough to invest in such a way he was already purchasing castles in Estonia, maybe we should pay attention and learn from him? Granted, we have a super small amount of holdings in comparison to him. Can't afford a castle (yet anyway!  LOL)  But here is one of Risto's classic posts from Bitcointalk that I think everyone should follow if they want to make the most of their BTC holdings:

Um.  Probably not from selling pizza! ;)
