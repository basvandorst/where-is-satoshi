I'm still waiting on the invite email for the card (done all my early acess requirements) but I'm looking forward to it eagerly. The card looks great and its exactly what I need.
Just yesterday I moved about 75% of my crypto (90% of my btc) into Xapo's vault. The vault is really a fantastic service. I love the little touches on the Xapo site and the super clean layout.
I don't think people realise how big Xapo's services are. 100% insured btc (yes I've read the controversy, I am confident they are insured) and a working live balance btc debit card?!! Game changing.

I'm actually planning on upgrading to a new phone anyways since my n900 doesn't support 4g and my city finally has it! I only upgrade when I have a good reason to :P

Thanks I just went ahead and used an open source QR scanner (
I didn't bother checking the code but given its open source it looks very safe. I will probably run it at home offline to be doubly sure.
Thanks for your help. I can start using Xapos vault now with some confidence while I wait for the card : )

Sometime this summer sounds like ages. They made it seem like they were mass shipping in July :s
Yes it is a one time setup (I would assume). I guess I could borrow my brothers phone and get a QR reader or something. Still they'd be better off offering the keys. I like to keep the keys as back up rather than screenshots of the QR codes.
Yes I have an app that doesn't scan it just holds the codes. It's that html based one you've maybe seen about. My phone (an old nokia n900) doesn't have a google auth app so I run the html app on my phones browser.

The real advantage here is for people who want to all in bitcoin (its ok I'm fairly poor anyways) so I can get 100% upside from bitcoins probable price rises (imo) while still having quick access to money to spend in day to day stores.
The slightly higher fees are far outweighed by bitcoins potential ROI.

Xapo have stated themselves many times that 100% of your vault is insured.
If you sign up to the site and read around its made clear that 100% of your Vault is secured. I really think that people are reading too much into clauses designed to protect Xapo and not, Xapo owned, insurance company Meridian.

Yeah truth told I'm pretty sure EVERY online retailer in Europe accepts Visa Debit. I've yet to come across a single one that doesn't.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:10:06
The retailer doesn't accept Bitcoin. Nothing can change that except the retailer.
This allows you to hold your funds in BTC and still pay at 100% of retailers. This is relevant. The world doesn't change over night, this is a big step and very convenient.

They stated that the first batch sent out didn't have Xapo branding but that following cards would AFAIR.

I'm in the UK and have selected GBP as currency so I see no problems there.
I get the txts but you can set up google authenticator with a qr code only, they don't give the key.
I don't use the txt based 2FA as it seems very buggy. Several times they have sent me a four digit code when it asks for a 6 digit code on site. Also some times the txt don't come through until after you click confirm.. it's weird and bugged. That's why I want to settup google auth but I can't :(
@_date: 2014-08-06 09:53:02
They aren't charging the monthly fee anymore ans thats the only one I had any major issues with.
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:48:17
Thanks, tried it in IE and it worked. Back to 1999.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:26:31
Anyone who wants to hold 100% of their disposable cash in BTC can make great use of this.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:18:43
Xapo are offering 100% insurance on their Vault (great for people who don't like the idea of  holding their own paper wallets).
No point to being able to hold as much of my capital in BTC as I want while only having to pay minimal extra fees?
@_date: 2014-08-05 14:56:27
I'm looking into qr decoders that scan images so I can read the secret key but now I'm paranoid about the security of these apps, as the qr code holds my username and secret key, all the app would need to guess is my 4 digit passcode!
Do you or anyone else for that matter know of a trustworthy app that reads a QR image file?

I have 2 ledger nanos and I must say they are fantasitic little devices. Really gives me great piece of mind. I carry one on my key ring at all times and another in a secure location in case i lose my keys!
The wallet software is user friendly and very polished looking, as is the hardware for that matter.
I've not had the pleasure of using this new device but if it's anything like the original nano I'm sure it's another great entry into the best hardware wallet suite out there.
Really can't say enough good things about my experienc with the nano.

Maxfield, a guy who also makes coins and other stuff found here,  , made them. It was a one time only run of ten. They were auctioned off on btctalk.

I wouldn't call the email misleading, you just misread it. It could list the value of your bitcoin in usd for eases sake but it's n nut really necessary.
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:22:15
So say in the future Bitcoin has to do an emergency hard fork for some security issue.
In your view that new fork isn't Bitcoin? It's an alt coin? You're entire logic is OBVIOUSLY flawed and biased. You need to re think your actions, you are doing serious damage to Bitcoin with this censorship.
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:56:16
Take a step back and analyze your own bias. By the way I have no favored option in the block size debate.


Every hardfork ever is programmed intentionally with that goal.


This isn't fact. This is your OPINION. Frankly an opinion which seems to go against the majority of this sub at least. Also given that XT would only ever become a thing if the MAJORITY switches.. 
The whole point in Bitcoin is the network decides. Let it decide. Don't abuse your position of power to influence the debate.

I'd actually love to see more games of skill introduced in the bitcoin gambling department. Are there any services which allow me to compete vs other people for bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:35:36
This does sound like the case. One of the few cases where being an early adopter paid off.
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:14:04
Yeah I've got to stick up for Circle here. I'm in the UK too and it's by far the easiest, quickest AND cheapest way I've found to purchase bitcoin.
I can decide to buy ($500 a week) and in less than 5 minutes I'll have the bitcoin awaiting confirmation to an offsite wallet. On top of that it only costs $15 all in (no other charges are made to my bank and the exchange rate is genuine, no fudging).
I love Circle.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:03:14
Great news. I'm a happy user of their nano wallet. I Will keep a keen eye on their future products.
Most professional bitcoin company I've ever dealt with.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:47:53
Thanks, I don't have android or IOS phone so app wasn't an option but I did manage to withdraw using Opera Mobile on my mobile.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:34:28
I'm with bank of Scotland. I signed up for circle right as it launched and as far as I recall I was setup right away.
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:37:07
I love bitcoin because.. it's anarchy. It's true financial freedom. Sure there are exchange hacks, the value goes up and down like a yoyo, there are scams a plenty.. but I don't fear or loathe these things. I embrace them. They simply remind me of the newfound freedom we all have. Never under estimate it.

Man this sucks. Seals is / was the only good bitcoin poker site around.
I hope Micon gets the new site up asap.
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:58:32
I actually like the header..
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:47:01
Thanks Fernando, I've somewhat resolved the issue myself in that I came up with a workaround.
I was able to withdraw the BTC using an Opera Mobile browser on my phone.
As far as I can see the issue still exists though with the field in question when I use my PC (win7 amd 64bit OS). Just wouldn't let me type more than one character in the 2nd factor text field.

Just bought a LEDGER wallet on the weekend, expecting delivery on Thursday.
To me creating the live USB bootable is a non issue so setup is secure.
The cost, form factor and nice looking Chrome wallet UI makes it a good choice over the Trezor imo.
