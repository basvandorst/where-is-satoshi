You pay taxes so the IRS doesn't fuck you up later. I mean sure, it's feasible you could fly under the radar on smaller amounts (though not risk free), but if you're going to sell any sizable amount I figure you're much more likely to be caught.
Getting BTC: You probably had to A.) buy BTC years ago when it was cheap so the amount of money spent is too small to be on the radar, B.) mine them, C.) buy locally/in person with cash.
Cashing out: A.) Sell locally/in person, B.) ?????. It's not like you can just say "fuck taxes!" while you go sell $100k of BTC on Coinbase, not report it on your taxes, then expect no consequences.
Yes, the tax disparity between classes sucks but what can you reasonably do where you keep your gains without getting in some deep shit with the IRS?

This ended up being the problem. I found out about the change addresses and then found the command to show all the receive addresses (including change addresses). After that I could export the private keys and import them into Electrum as normal.

If it hasn't happened yet, I don't expect it to for a while. I think it'd take a large shift in technology such as quantum computers becoming available.
Even then, I'm not sure but the encryption method on Bitcoin might could be changed to newer methods that stand up to future technology. I'm not an expert on this matter, so someone else will have to chime in.

I'd say the only way it's going to be worth 0 is if the underlying encryption is broken to where it can be completely manipulated.

I'd run a full node 24/7 on my home server if it wasn't for Comcast's bandwidth cap.

I don't know if they have it nationwide or not. It's 1TB a month. Shows up somewhere for me when I log into my account

don't understand that part at all.

how do we know someone got it?

I wonder this too. I could probably save up enough bitcoins from some moderate GPU mining to preorder one of the Jalapeno asic miners, but I wonder if it would be worth it. I also wonder how well they're going to be able to fill preorders. I'd be very disappointed if a month from now I spent all the btc I have to preorder then don't get one until early next year.
Lately I've mostly just been using my moderate btc earnings to get Amazon gift cards to buy some smaller things I want. If investing in some asic hardware would be beneficial and not take forever to recover my initial investment then I'd be interested. I'd feel a little sick though If I bought specialty hardware that would be virtually useless (for other tasks) if the difficulty skyrocketed so much that I'm barely making anything from mining. Buying graphics cards didn't bother me as much because I could use them for gaming or resell them easily. I don't think the same could be said for the Jalapeno or other asic hardware.

If only mining was still booming enough that it could pay off a 7970 in a reasonable amount of time.

More like buying Bitcoin to prepare for the collapse of the USD accelerated by Trump.

I know that seems to be the general consensus here, but it makes your username kinda ironic from a typical investing standpoint ;)

Ok, but I'll continue typing.

I've bought from there a couple of times a couple of years ago. Everything was fine with the transaction, but the prices vary from decent to awful depending on the game.

I believe that calculator is broke. I've been using it and just a day or two ago it estimated I'd make around 0.144 BTC per day (which is about on par with what i'm getting). Now with the same stats AND the the difficulty hasn't changed since then it's saying I'll only make 0.00601 BTC per day.
