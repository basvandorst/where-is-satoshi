I received .29 BTC and I hadn't owned any previously
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:26:40
The vast majority of people are selling it and sadly my friends didnt participate, despite my urging.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:47:48
Sorry for being a Reddit noob, but what kind of proof would you suggest?
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:29:28
As a student at MIT, I'd like to point out that we have downtime like students at every other university. Plus today is Veteran's day so there are no classes.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:39:38
Also they told us that we should probably not do anything illegal as they would/could track the bitcoin flow around the university.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:17:14
As a freshmen, a lot of my friends and classmates are under the age of 18.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:54:43
There are a lot of cool things going on with the blockchain and Bitcoin around the university, but not everyone here is into computer sciences. Heres an exampkle of some cool stuff: [MIT Bitcoin app contest winners](

Sadly, the unbelievers were left behind. The project is no longer still accepting signups. A lot of the sceptism came from people's parents, as people under 18 needed their parents' signatures to participate.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:38:24
Thanks! I was already interested in the currency, so it was cool for the university to get me started with it. I really think the support for startups and the focus on producing a viable ecosystem for Bitcoin around the university is the best part of the project
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:51:33
None that I know of, sadly.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:17:52
Most people don't have any idea what Bitcoin is. I've actually heard people talking about not signing up for the project because they thought it was a scam.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:36:18
They simply sent the bitcoin to an wallet address we provided. However, we had to use our certificates to sign up, so there was no possibility of duplicates, fakes, etc.

He bought them at market value at the time, around $104.00 per person.

And loans, blood, sweat, and tears
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:53:22
Like winning the lottery! 
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:56:32
I wish you the best of luck! Maybe a franchise in Boston? 
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:36:59
That would be awesome! 
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:23:41
Sadly the public school system isn't very good at preparing people for MIT rigor, so episodes like this are not uncommon. I have felt the same way (though I knew about vectors the first day of physics) in other classes and working hard to "catch up" is part of freshmen year here.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:45:18
That's a cool way to spread the word. You'd be surprised by how many people, even here at an elite and smart university, are too lazy or complacent to look things up for themselves.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:59:07
That would definitely have been more successful in terms of creating informed "consumers" so to speak, but the purpose of the project was to examine how people would use the bitcoin if an ecosystem for it existed. also, convincing MIT students to do anything time-intensive is a hard push. Here, that old adage, "Time is money", really does apply and time is probably the most important commodity.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:33:24
At the bookstore, we have a Bitcoin ATM. As far as local places accepting  Bitcoin, I haven't heard anything official. However, the point of the project was to build a bitcoin ecosystem, so the Bitcoin club is helping startups and at HackMit, CoinBase provided their APIs. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:34:01
Some people are creating new services and keeping their Bitcoin, but we are college students and the struggle is real. I think it's going to be interesting to see what kinds of services will be invented here.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:25:05
A lot of people are selling it to people who can exchange the bitcoin for cash. One of the guys in my dorm has gained 2 bitcoins from buying it off people.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:40:54
I didn't know that. I think that would be good information to distribute to the student population because we all like food!
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:04:27
I had been following Bitcoin or months before coming here, so I would've looked up the price. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:44:14
Well since MIT is 50% white and 30% Asian, you are wrong. The school is simply hard and most people are heavily involved in an extracurricular or two
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:22:00
I am by no means an expert on the Bitcoin community at MIT. However, I believe that supporting the startups that come out of MIT and other universities will definitely help to grow the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:04:11
I used Coinbase, simply because I already had an account in anticipation.  Others used BitStamp, BlockChain and others. As for solid figures, I'm not the one to ask. Sorry!
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:54:07
Of course! When I go to the club, I just throw paper wallets at them.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:10:12
I can only tell you what I've heard. But one of my friend's mother said that she didn't understand the point of bitcoin and that unless her daughter wrote her a report showing the benefits and safety of bitcoin, she wouldn't sign the permission form. My friend simply didn't have the time to convince her mom.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:20:41
well MIT is the best school in the country in computer science, so while the project was definitely a cool project, it didn't really play into my decision to come.
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:28:20
Added to the original post. I was hesitant to release personal information on the internet.
@_date: 2014-11-12 03:47:35
No, I haven't spent any yet. But I might get some winter gear.
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:58:13
Uhhh dude, not everyone has next semester paid for. Freshmen still have tear ducts and worries.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:11:38
If only Tosci's accepted Bitcoin... My life would be so much happier!
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:49:26
They transferred on the network. They were discussing when I walked in, but they came to the conclusion that it would be the most helpful way to exchange bitcoin, in terms of the experimental side of the project. We received the bitcoin by giving the project a wallet address.
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:48:15
This is most definitely true. Also, my experience might be tinted by the fact that very few of my friends are interested in compsci
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:36:52
Goodmorning!
