What happened last night?

@_date: 2017-11-04 03:59:48
So how much did you have to put in first?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:01:56

 I think most recommend making a wallet like Bread Wallet if you're using apps.

Why would the the demand growing be guaranteed?

Coinbase doesn't actually give you keys to your coins, so if you wanted to get them out of coinbase afterwards they'd be in whatever form coinbase chooses them to be in 
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:02:01
It really looked like it was getting there haha
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:53:26
So how would they show on my wallet? Two different coins or one coin? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:27:05
Why don't you have them pay before you start then have it verified during the haircut? Get a notification on your phone or something 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:19:00
In a few hours :)

@_date: 2017-10-17 06:51:12
How do we log back on to retrieve them? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:22:39
Before or after the split it tripled?
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:52:06
Same here but this peak has been looking pretty stable.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:48:23
Wdym they'll give you both coins, so will we get two currencies?
