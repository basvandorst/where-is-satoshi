When will the first LN implementations be ready?

Changelly has no limit but you can't fix the rate. Considering long block times for BCH, 6 confirmations required from changelly and the volatility means that you risk receiving much less BTC that you expected..

Wasn't complaining about it. Just general discussion. I still consider it a decent service.

How can we measure decentralization? And when is it enough to prevent this type of behaviour?
We already see large mining pools or groups of mining pools and it could be easy for them to collude to push the fees up.

Fees will grow linearly with the price for onchain transactions. It wasn't too bad two years ago to pay 1 mBTC for a regular transaction... now things have changed. Price increased tenfold, users probably too.

If you store the blockchain locally (BitcoinCore wallet) nobody can link your addresses. If you get your balance through external servers or SPV wallet, they can link all your addresses together.

Awesome! I really need to read more literature. 
I thought that a "bidirectional" channel was created using two on-chain transactions, one used to move money fro Alice to Bob and the second to move it from Bob to Alice.

So counting new p2sh outputs gives a raw estimation of segwit addresses? New multisig addresses will also be included in that number right?

Thanks for you answer. I would have liked more discussion about this topic but this post didn't really took off so feel free to relaunch the topic elsewhere. Let me know if you get more attention!

never voted in my life

Fees are high these days. Don't move them too often or wait for the mempool to clear up!

Statistics about Segwit adoption could be interesting and few block explorers show them at the moment. 
- segwit tx / block

3:  aren't channels monodirectional? How does recharging work? 
I mean, you can receive funds on the parallel channel but they will not be spendable without an on-chain transaction, right?

if you say so..
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:25:22
Yes very valuable indeed!
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:17:59
my balls too

That's free software. Code a wallet yourself if you don't trust them

The world is overpopulated. People dying is actually a good thing.
