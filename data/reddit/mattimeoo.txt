I guess Ethereum is unrealistic as well by your logic.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:30:37
I think that people forget that if this happens, BTC will just fork to use a quantum resistant encryption algorithm and to a state before the BTC was moved.
ETH VS ETH Classic is a good example.

John Oliver sucks.

I noticed that too, the interviewer is legitimately baffled and rightfully so.  The level of dishonesty from Mnuchin is staggering.

You're miseducating people with that pamphlet . . .  "There are no transaction fees."  Come on . . .
@_date: 2019-07-06 08:11:38
No, I just happen to be someone that has worked with distributed computing since the late 90's and was in the bitcoin space before it had a price and I understand it, as well as several other chains, very well on a technical level.  It's absolutely ok to be wrong, which in this case, you are.
@_date: 2019-07-04 23:34:05
You're wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:31:39
You know you're reading the words of a charlatan with a side of sociopathy when they think that they can tell the future of markets (especially when they quote numbers).
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:44:12
Unfortunately, you're wrong as well.  If you fork, you can omit or edit anything and if people accept and adopt, it becomes reality.  I get where you're coming from in terms of not editing the chain, but for example, you can alter the keys of the huge wallet, rendering it useless and wouldn't accept a migration.  This is all based on consensus and whatever is healthiest would (should) be adopted.

Someone needs to do this with one of the many giant rooms full of cash from busts.

I love my $60k desk chair that I got from overstock that my cats have absolutely destroyed.  Feels great!

Hope you're right.  *rolls dice*
Moral of the story is TA and predictions are pretty much hocus pocus.
@_date: 2019-07-13 07:21:25
Also verify this.

So is it a piece of overpriced pretty metal circle to trick people or does it hold a private key?
@_date: 2019-07-16 07:24:01
This is turning into an extremely painful retrospective thread.  I also have a 2 BTC laptop that I still use ($500).  No bueno to think about.

2000 horsepower?!  Yep, everyone is gonna die.

Good God you are stupid.  Scammers deserve life imprisonment.

Except he isn't.  He can read, sure.
@_date: 2019-07-04 23:35:16
I guess the people would decide.  Read up on what initially happened to Ethereum.  It's now called "Ethereum Classic," and the new chain is the "real," Ethereum.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:46:22
And also stupid enough to be the mouth of a teleprompter.
@_date: 2019-07-03 07:33:31
Interesting to know that you seem extremely new to the space.
@_date: 2019-07-04 23:34:38
Well you would effectively have coin on both chains.  Why would someone stay on an insecure (hackable) chain that just had like a million coins liquidated?  I think people would jump over pretty quickly.

6 day old troll account.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:32:19
Just calling it like I see it.  That, and your clear arrogant attitude that you think you're an expert because you "bought at $800," and your claims that you "probably have more than me."  You're pretty gross and clearly need an ego check.
Edit: And it's a bit too obvious that you're trolling and only made your account to do just that.
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:26:29
Probably busy thinking about how that you're a scammer.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:03:02
Probably a child that bought 50 bucks worth at 11k and is freaking out to see 4 figures instead of 5.  6 day old troll account made specifically to cry about losing 2 dollars.
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:16:19
And Steem and BitShares, too.  Mentioning them would have dwarfed BCH.

Lol.  EOS averages over 4 million a day at less than 0.1% network capacity . . .

"They," "are/were," "team."  "Earth residents."

These are toxic as hell until the rates become something reasonable.  At the current rate it's going, it's robbery and it really discourages the layman.

Not taking cash should be illegal.

RetarTed, eh?
@_date: 2019-02-03 03:20:16
I'm not comparing Bitcoin and Steem.  Two completely different use cases.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:30:40
During bull runs like this, newcomer information should be pinned, IMO.
@_date: 2019-02-24 23:08:46
Just grab a stack when you see them and cut the .com off with scissors.  Works like a charm.
@_date: 2019-06-09 00:56:21
Please never say this again.
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:55:42
If I were to guess, I bet the government would assume your position is born on the day of the initial transfer to your most recent address, otherwise it would be practically impossible to enforce due to bitcoin's pseudoanonymity.
I'm guessing they want to know whether or not to view your trading habits as long or short term?
EDIT:  Unless you could prove your purchase of the exact amount on a KYC/AML enforced exchange and could say "I was trying different wallets," or something.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:55:26
THREE months.
@_date: 2019-02-02 22:39:35
This is already happening on the Steem blockchain.

Biometrics as a form of security is total trash and an absolutely poor design flaw, especially in terms of wealth control/cryptocurrency.

Already done.  It's called Bitshares.

A common theory is that those keys were burned, which would be awesome.  I still think Craig is a phoney, though.
