The legislation and taxation is increasing all over the world, but I disagree that its only value is as a tool for tax evasion and anonymity, and I disagree that this will ultimately result in the destruction of its value as asset.  I think the contrary is true.  I'm not one of those idiots over at the Bitcoin Foundation.  Check out what the DOJ says about bitcoin.  It's not illegal to own.  It's illegal to operate an unlicensed money exchange.  I respect your opinion.  Are you saying that just bitcoin is losing value or all crypto is losing value?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:45:48
You should invest in something that produces something of value such as:
1.  Rental properties (where rent exceeds maintenance costs)
2.  Farm land (where profits from selling weat, corn, pigs, etc. exceeds costs of maintaining farm)
3.  Dividend issuing stock of a solid company
4.  A good business of your own
Neither gold nor cryptocurrencies produce profits that allow you to live off of your investments.  Both gold and cryptocurrencies can go up and you can sell them at a profit, but once you've sold them, they're gone.  Real investments keep providing for you and your descendants for years and years.  Just ask the folks who own the apartment building you once lived in which is better, rental property, bitcoin, gold, usd.

I'm hodling until 2032.  That was my plan from day one when I bought in early last year.  If bitcoin can go from 0 to 10k in 7 or 8 years, what will it do from 2017 to 2032?  Might go to zero, might go to the moon.  Who knows?  So far, all crypto haters have been wrong.  I think the haters who have been wrong every day for the past 8 years will continue to be wrong for the next 15.  BTW, next month the US Congress will take up crypto legislation.  The FUD from that should produce a sizable drop in price, so you might want to hold some USD in reserve for that dip.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:51:02
Exactly.  This is what we had when the dollar was tied to the price of gold.  The Federal reserve can increase or decrease the amount of USD in circulation in order to keep it stable.  If you buy bitcoin, don't bitch about the price fluctuations.  That's what you signed up for.

I know exactly where you're coming from and I've been waiting for the same thing for 10 years now and it hasn't happened.  I once believed exactly what you've said, but all that's happened is asset inflation.  All the major industrialized countries having been pumping out money like crazy in an effort to fight deflation and it has resulted in what looks like a surging stock market, but its really just re-denominated shares.  I think that's what's really behind the surge in cryptos/usd.  I totally understand what you're saying my friend, and I've been moving my cash to as many different assets as possible, but I don't believe a gold backed dollar is the answer.  The US experienced several major booms and busts in the 1800s, and after the government had to go hat-in-hand to Mr. J.P. Morgan for operating cash, it created the Federal Reserve.  Crypto, real estate, dow stocks, these can help individuals weather the storm, but neither gold nor crypto are going to create financial stability.  I don't know if anything will.  Yep, inflation is on the way.  I'm 50, and I remember what real inflation looks like.  Good luck.

You are 100% correct.  Go ahead and call me a FUDder, but I think Trump is talking about this because Venezuela, Russia, and China are working on establishing another crypto they can control to be the new global payment currency.  The USA is currently in control of the world financial system, and it can seriously hinder another country's economy with nothing more than financial constraints.  Now, if the USA would not tolerate a military threat to its dominance, why would it tolerate a threat to its financial dominance.  Facebook only pushed the issue into the minds of the leaders of both parties, and now they are probably going to ban the whole thing before it really gets too big for them.  I know, bitcoin is global, but so is the reach of the USA financial system.  A lot of other countries will take the same position and ban private ownership of crypto.  President FDR banned hoarding gold by an executive order, and President Ford cancelled that ban with his own executive order.  Can Trump do the same to all crypto?  I don't know, but when you unite both parties, law enforcement, the military, and the federal reserve of the USA, they get what they want.

And then there's the waste of space, labor hours, and user time.   I'm not talking about Bitcoin waste, I'm talking about multiple retail banks on taking up valuable space on every street in every commercial district in the world; paying people to stand at counters and conduct menial tasks to move small amounts of value around.  The waste in my own downtown blows my mind and yet the real costs and the opportunity costs are ignored while bitcoin mining energy consumption now comes into focus as the big problem with crypto.  Imagine how much more efficient and affluent our society would be if we could just get all that banking people, space, and power infrastructure into something that made our world better!  To me, that's the promise of fintech.  Getting rid of wasteful consumer banks, that should be our goal.

He needs to buy bitcoins instead of books on Bitcoin.  I had a similar experience a few months ago.  I called the Business College where I got my MBA and asked to talk to a professor about Bitcoin.  Eventually someone got me connected to a professor.  When I asked him about his thoughts on blockchain technology and virtual currencies, he told me that it sounded more like a computer question than a finance question.  It made me sad and disappointed to know that the professors and their students were going to be blind sided by this paradigm shift.

China devalues its currency in order to promote exports and it severely restricts the outflow of cash.  So if you accumulate wealth in China, you will want to store your wealth in Bitcoin.

All but two of the top cryptos are down today, so you have to look at the fundamentals of the whole space to understand what's going on.  If you go to CNBC's website you will see that bank stocks are surging and the dollar is strong.  Crypto is an attack on those two much larger and much stronger areas of the world economy, so when they surge, cryptos tank.  Being diversified in your investments doesn't mean holding lots of different cryptos and no stocks.  It means holding some cryptos and some stocks, preferable stocks from different sectors.

I don't know of any mass-market investment that's done as well as bitcoin for those that bought in June or earlier.  I suspect that after a long dip, bitcoin's up trend will continue and the folks who bought in December will be ok.  It might take three years or more, but the up trend should continue.   My point is that every investment is risky.  There have been lots of real estate projects and exchange traded companies that have gone belly up, and Bitcoin may do the same eventually.  (see Enron, Bear Sterns, your local mall, your local strip mall where weeds grow but customers don't, your local dilapidated fire-trap apartment complex)  Bitcoin free from the risk posed by a bad CEO or a bad contractor, and its subject to risks like a 51% attack that don't exist with stock or real estate.  By the way, I think the whole beanie baby thing started with stores that were fronts for money-laundering.  If you earned $1000 from a drug sale, you could wash that by saying someone came in to your store and paid $1000 in cash for a rare beaning baby, and poof, you now have $1000 legit.  Other people who didn't know what really happened then thought these things were rare and valuable then bought them up.

Well done.  I found data online from April of 2013 and came up with a similar equation when I plotted it on a semi-log plot:   Price = 10\^(1.3+(0.00116\*(no. of days after April 28, 2013))) .  Please post the URL where you got your data.  By the way, you also get a straight line when you plot the S&amp;P 500 from 1950 to the present.  That's a trend that's held for 67 years.  So, if the S&amp;P 500 follows a semi-log straight line for 67 years, then its not unreasonable for Bitcoin to do the same.  When you consider how the world population has grown and how the economies of the world have grown since 1950, exponential growth of an asset class is not unreasonable.  Criticising asset growth by comparing it to a human's growth is unreasonable.  It's not just comparing apples to oranges.  Its comparing year-to-year growth of the apple industry to the growth of a single orange tree.

And what would she recommend instead?  A stock for a company who's executives are lying on their SEC disclosures about the off-book liabilities and are bilking the company for every cent they can steal?  Real estate that is ill-liquid and doesn't earn any income until it's renovated and that renovation will cost 3x what the contractor tells you?  Options or futures contracts?  (Cause most are over priced and you are guaranteed to lose money even when the underlying asset increases in value.)  P2P lending?  (Good luck collecting your principal back from the guy who came to you because a bank wouldn't give him a loan.)  After stocks, real estate, P2P loans, and derivatives, if you leave out crypto then the only thing that's left for the average Joe is gambling, and your're gonna lose that most of the time.

I urge caution with P2P lending.  Ask yourself, how do I get my money back if the borrower doesn't pay me?  Is my loan secured by real estate with a mortgage or deed of trust that was properly drafted and filed in the county register's office?  Do I have enough cash to pay a collection attorney to initiate a lawsuit or a foreclosure?  When the banks lose money on bad loans, what makes you think you'll do better loaning to a person who can't get a loan from a bank?  As for me, I'm staying away from P2P.

I found some data at [
I plotted that on an Excel spreadsheet and plotted a line to meet the bottom of the curve on semi-log scale.  The trend line starts on April 28, 2013 with a value of 1.3 and then increases by 0.00116 every day.  So each trendline value =10\^(1.3+(0.00116\*(no. of days after April 28, 2013))) trend line predicts the following prices.  That returned the following values for the following dates:
Jan 1, 2019      $5,079.72
Jan 1, 2020    $13,466.04
Jan 1, 2021    $35,793.00
Jan 1, 2022    $94,885.53
Jan 1, 2023  $251,535.91
Jan 1, 2024  $666,806.77

The people who sold at 12k back in January look like geniuses now.

"I know . . ."  No, you don't.  I am not trying to be insulting, but you are making some broad, unfounded assumptions.  Neither you nor I know what people on the left end of the political spectrum are doing with regard to Bitcoin.  There is no liberal or conservative tag that get's turned on when someone buys or sells Bitcoin.  I am on the left and I was and still am in Bitcoin.  I don't trust "the system" either.  I'm on the left mainly because when Alberto Gonzalez was Attorney General, he stated before congress that you and I are not guaranteed the right of habeas corpus in the U.S. Constitution.  This is consistent with other republican positions such as when the position that the president cannot be indicted for a crime (Trumps lawyer Guliani and Trump's supreme court nominee Kavanaugh), and if the president does it then its legal (Nixon).  I was a Republican when I realized only Republican leaders lean toward authoritarianism, while Democratic leaders don't.  My right to habeas corpus is a bright line that cannot be crossed, and it should be for you too.  If you truly believe you are voting for people who support freedom, you should take a good look at what the Republican leaders are doing, not what other Republicans like yourself are saying.  Republicans voters are good, decent people, but they keep on voting for people that actually do not support policies and positions supported by Republican voters.  That's my two cents.  I wish you all the best.

When not plugged in, all the hardware wallets in the world require zero energy.  Meanwhile, all the banks that hold inactive deposits still have to keep the lights on, pay employees, pay auditors, air condition the buildings, pay property taxes, and those employees and auditors have to travel by car, train, etc.  So, which is more efficient when storing money for the long periods in terms of energy, space, human hours, taxes, etc?  Clearly, its crypto.

I knew a guy in college who lost all his savings and family inheritance because in 2009 Roubini predicted that the stock market crash would continue and that whole countries would go bankrupt, hedge funds were going to collapse, the auto loan market would collapse, the commercial real estate market would collapse, etc.  My college buddy put everything into 'puts' and expected a huge payout.  He told me at the time that if it worked, he was going to open up his own hedge fund.  Instead everything sharply rebounded in March of 2009.  Like the old saying goes, 'even a stopped watch is right twice a day.'  This guy it right one time.  He's gotten it wrong far more times than that.

You have made a good point.  When journalists and economists cover corporate or fed news, they report the facts but do not make recommendations to buy or sell stocks or bonds.  But when they cover Bitcoin, their reporting is lazy and they let their biases and smug, arrogant, paternalistic attitudes take over.  Yes, I'm pissed I didn't buy Bitcoins in 2011 when I read about it for the first time because listened to these reporters and I didn't think critically about what I was reading.  You are absolutely right.  When some stranger is trying to protect you, you should suspect that person of being the scammer.

According to the vast majority r/Bitcoin threads, everything is good for bitcoin.  There is never a downside.  Do you remember what happened at the ATH?  The very minute CME futures started trading Bitcoin price took a hit.  That's why I don't buy this narrative that BAKKT is good for bitcoin, and yes, I am commenting on the article. 
Seriously, saying "WRONG - you don't understand this" is a ridiculous statement.  Clearly I have touched an anxiety of yours.  Instead of burying your head in the sand, try considering that this article is wrong and be prepared.  Eventually, the shorts will be covered after the shorters make millions, and the price will rise again.  But don't expect BAKKT to lift the price.  That's not what futures do, ever.  Go ahead and say I don't know what I'm talking about, but I've been trading stocks and futures for 20 years.  Futures cannot and will not affect underlying demand or rejection of a commodity.
The most important thing to remember is that Bitcoin does not need BAKKT to succeed.  BAKKT is a distraction.

This is not bullish.  The futures market allows people to take short positions.  We may see massive sell orders that will crush the market and drive down the price.  Also, expecting institutional investors is a fantasy dreamed by people who do not understand that institutions have rules that strictly limit what they can invest in.  Institutions are typically limited to investing in triple A bonds or some similar top grade investment.  No pension manager is going to risk his job on investing in an unregulated asset.

I plotted the data myself with the help of a free website and came up with the following equation: =$N$17+($N$14-$N$17)/(1+(C2/$N$16)^$N$15)^$N$18, where $N$14 = 2.274617, $N$15 = 5.846328, $N$16 = 21206.22, $N$17 = 10728.26, $N$18 = 28146.72 and C is the price, all sorted earliest price on top on an Excel spreadsheet.  I'll send you a copy if you want.
Basically, its technical analysis, which is mostly BS, but when most of the fundamental analysis of bitcoin is even bigger BS, what was I going to do?  Anyway, it gave me a hint at where the bottom really was.  Nobody rings a bell and says "here's the bottom!"  So if you can graph the price movement, then fork out the cash and try not to puke as you wait for months to know whether you won or lost.  Good luck.

What does Samsung get?  Samsung gets to integrate Ledger technology into their phones, giving them a sizable leg up on competitors when marketing to crypto holders.  First Ledger had a secure wallet that you had to plug into a computer.  Then they came out with one that uses blue-tooth to wirelessly connect to a phone.  The next logical step is to already be in the phone.  I own a moto phone, but if my next phone negated my need to have a separate hardware wallet, I my next phone will be a Samsung.

That's close to what he said.  Krugman said:  " ultimately, it’s backstopped by the fact that the U.S. government will accept dollars as payment of tax liabilities — liabilities it’s able to enforce because it’s a government. If you like, fiat currencies have underlying value because men with guns say they do. And this means that their value isn’t a bubble that can collapse if people lose faith."  see: [ So, if you don't pay the U.S. with U.S. fiat, men with guns will take your stuff, so you better come up with some U.S. fiat.  It's not that men with guns force people to accept dollars, it's that men with guns force you to pay them with dollars or suffer the consequences.  Either way, he has correctly identified the foundation for the currency's value, and either way, it's a crappy foundation for a currency.

It makes me less bullish.  It makes me wonder if it's time to get out of crypto.  The US federal government can tell the rest of the world to stop doing business with another country and most of the world will stop.  Crypto is tiny and generally disliked by governments across the world.  If the US decided to criminalize it, crypto would be over.  Yes, some dudes in Somalia and other similar government-free zones would still run some nodes, but there would be very little interest in it outside of that.  Bitcoin cannot simultaneously be the way to get around a Paypal ban and get adopted by hedge funds and pension funds leading to additional price growth.  If the FDIC is shutting down businesses due to content (which is illegal per the First Amendment) then it's not going to allow Bitcoin to be promoted as legitimate by allowing an ETF and it is likely to force all businesses from accepting crypto.  Is this is like a dead canary in a coal mine?  No, it's like a dead hot babe with black wings in a coal mine.

He's not a troll.  He's right about how a block chain can only tell you who made the video and when.  That covers the first half of what it takes for getting it admitted into evidence in a court proceeding.  Unfortunately, a video and all of its meta data can be changed before it is uploaded to a block chain, but that's not the real problem.  Consider an unaltered picture of an abused dog.  We know when the picture was taken and we know who took it.  Without personal testimony (which might be lies) we don't know who's dog it is, where the dog was when it was beaten, where it is now, who beat it, when the dog was beaten, how old the dog is, was it taken over state lines, was the dog actually beaten or did it get into a fight with another dog, etc.  A picture of a beaten dog is not enough to convict someone of animal abuse.  Every time some scandalous video or picture is pushed out into the public view or in a court there is a narrative attached to it.  Someone is asserting what is "true."  That's the other half that's needed for a picture or a video to be admissible in court.  It's great that a block chain can get you half the way there.

Clearly, fiat can die.  Just look at any country where hyper-inflation has occured.  What I don't understand is why any cryptocurrency would take it's place rather than another fiat currency or another physical currency, like gold, or a usable commodity which has historically been used as a medium of exchange.  Seriously, I'm not trying to troll anyone here.  I'm interested in hearing someone's argument as to why crypto (which requires computers and an internet connection) would become the currency of a county where transactions occur at farmer's produce stands, at street side hot dog vendor's carts, etc.  I'm going to a bitcoin meet-up tomorrow night and I would like to tap the wisdom of the members of this forum.

You're right.  The last quarterly report should have come out in May.  That's highly suspicious.

Lawyer here.  The plaintiff of the suit must be someone who invested money and then lost it because of fraud committed by the defendant.  I scanned the thread and no-one said that.  One person posted "Do we know anyone yet who was defrauded by bitcoin.com. . . ."  I didn't see anyone who identified himself as such.  Without an injured plaintiff, the law suit would be asking the court to answer an academic question.  Anyone can file a nonsense lawsuit about anything, but only legitimate lawsuits survive the first Motion to Dismiss (see Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and research 'standing').  If you want to support this litigation (or any other for that matter) wait until you see the Plaintiff pass that hurdle.  Otherwise, assume this is a scam.
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:57:01
You are correct, and I think it is a problem for Roger.  He's also got another problem.  It's based on an old concept called "slander on title" or "slander upon title."  Basically, if a person says things that are provably false about someone else's property, and those lies result in a loss of value of that property, then the owner of that property can recover that loss in value from the person who lied.  Instead of just letting the market place decide which is better, Roger has been talking down bitcoin for months.  If it can be proven that what he said were lies and that those lies resulted in a loss in value to bitcoin, then the entire community of bitcoin owners would form a class for a class action suit against him.  I'm concerned about the war of words on both sides.  Mainly, I Jamie Dimon needs to worry about that.  Remember when he said something like 'bitcoin is a scam' and the price dropped the next day?  All you have to prove is that its not a scam (which isn't hard) and that it resulted in a loss (which it did).

In a criminal case, the plaintiff is the government.  For instance, you can find a copy of "United States of America v. George Papadopoulous" online.  Other than that, you are EXACTLY RIGHT! 
 In a criminal case, no private party needs to raise money to pay for the prosecution.  The government pays for the whole thing because it's the government's job to send fraudsters to the pokey.  There is no need for Mr. MoneyTrigz to raise any money at all if he wants to punish a fraudster.  If anyone is a victim of a bitcoin.com scam, that person needs to see the local U.S. or state attorney general.  Check out "Nixa Man Pleads Guilty to Illegal Bitcoin Exchange."  You'll see a sentence at the bottom of the press release that says "Bitcoin are not illegal in and of themselves and have legitimate uses."  That is a statement by the U.S. Department of Justice!  But again, yes, you have an excellent point.

I'm no expert, but EOS and Waves have impressive dapp development going on by some dedicated developers.  Monero can't be scaled, but its got a reason to exist as an alternative to Bitcoin for wealth storage.  Stellarlumins has the backing of some major tech giants.  I just don't see a reason why any of these projects would go away because Bitcoin reached $100,000 or higher and the article did not give any rational as to why that would happen.   If anyone can cite a reason why price growth in Bitcoin would end all alts, I would like to read about that.
