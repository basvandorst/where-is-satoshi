Yeah... I'm not entirely sure the offices will even be occupied by next week. Good luck.

You're on a hell of a manhunt here.
Be careful, the guy says he's been hacked. Give him a chance to have a third party audit his environment before you send folks to burn down his house.

Yes. To install Java, because I don't run Java, nor javascript, nor anything fun on my workstation.
I do, however, have several non-persistent virtual machines that I use when I'm in the mood to browse reddit and whatnot. Running a tight ship has become pretty easy over the past few years.

He did, actually. CAF under the federal 80/20 split program is no longer possible in most circumstances by state or local police. State and local police may still be permitted to seize assets under state and local laws, though. I am not sure if there is a source that lays out CAF laws by state/locality.

Coinbase will let you make instant trades straight from the interface, true... But if you want to blow a bit of money trading on coinbase you can jump on their actual exchange (gdax) and transfer funds into/out of it free. There you can mess around with limit and stop loss orders in addition to the market orders you're doing on coinbase proper... Limit orders are free, go have some fun.

Oh cool library, I'll have to mess around with that.

Awesome project! Suggestion: For diversity, consider integrating atlantic.net as a VPS provider as well - they meet the price point and have an API that you can get familiar with.

I had a thought. Start a gold exchange. Now stay with me here.... Buying Gold with a credit card is something that payment processors and FinCEN understand. You're bound to get a lower fee. Now the trick here is that after a waiting period the gold can be exchanged for bitcoins. The waiting period for exchange access and transactions decrease with transaction count and purchase volume over time. I believe this would also soften the waiting period for customers as they would feel they are playing the gold and bit coin markets. Shit if you don't do this I might have to.

Sounds good. My only advice would be to go for maximum impact. Tip each front page thread's OP $1, have the bot reply to the OPs top comment in the thread. Have the bot check to make sure OP has not redeemed a tip before or have more than a few dollars pending, and if they have tip the top comment in the thread instead of the OP.

I saw how you had to pick up your iPad to allow the customer to scan, just want you to know I've visited one place that used an iDevice POS system and they had acrylic ipad holders that tipped forward 90 degrees for the customer to sign credit transactions, they're out there, and they are slick.
EDIT: Found something like it and damn they're pricey.

Signing is done asymmetrically....
