I really enjoy my nano s. I had the $10 ledger hw.1 before and it was simply broken. Also, ledger's software does have quite a few kinks and rough edges. But the nano s works like a charm, has a really polished feeling, and I love the form factor. I'm not sure if a real USB plug would have been nicer. 
IMHO, the nano s beats the trezor ATM in price, security (secure element vs homemade), form factor and features (eth/etc/u2f available now, open source extendability looks good). Trezor 2 or a halving in price for trezor might change that. Trezor also might have slightly better street cred. Then, there is digital bitbox, which might be a good alternative.

Why don't you try and google this question. Look here on reddit, bitcointalk, stackexchange, you name it. Trust me, it has been discussed over and over and over again since at least 2011. Not much has changed since then either. 
Tl:dr: It's not very likely that quantum computing will evolve to be a thread suddenly. Or ever, but if it ever did we'll most certainly know 20 years in advance. 
What we'll do if this ever materializes is unclear, because as of now, quantum safe alternative crypto systems aren't performing as well as we need them to. Even if they did, the process of switching will be messy (people will have to move their coins, and what do we do with the coins that aren't moved, say Sathoshi's?), but certainly doable.

The folklore conjecture in this paper is just that - a conjecture. It sounds true, but it appears that the Edinburgh Uni folks sponsored by IOHK have disproven that conjecture in their ouroboros genesis paper. Mind you that paper is pretty long and involved and presupposes a lot of earlier work, so I wouldn't vouch for its correctness nor that it means what they say it means. But it reads pretty valid to me and I've so far unsuccessfully tried to get more competent people in the space to comment. @_date: 2015-12-09 16:42:43

It's an inherent limitation of any blockchain. In order to be maximally secure, the blockchain design mandates that every node has to receive and verify every transaction. This implies long inter block times in order to achieve synchronization and small blocks in order to keep decentralized. Security - Decentralization - high throughput/low latency: choose  two.
So yes, you might call LN a workaround to the limitations of blockchains, but you might also call it a brilliant use of blockchains that makes it possible to get all three of the above properties.

Observation 1 (Throughput limit) Given the current overlay network and
today’s 10 minute average block interval, the block size should not exceed 4MB.
How to interpret/use these numbers. We stress that the above are conservative
bounds on the extent to which reparametrization alone can scale Bitcoin’s
peer-to-peer overlay network given its current size and underlying protocols.
Other, more difficult-to-measure metrics could also reveal scaling limitations.
One example is fairness. Our measurement results (see Section 3.1) suggest that
in today’s Bitcoin overlay network, when nodes are ordered by block propagation
time, the top 10% of nodes receive a 1MB block 2.4min earlier than the bottom
10% — meaning that depending on their access to nodes, some miners could
obtain a significant and unfair lead over others in solving hash puzzles. Due to
complicating factors, e.g., the fact that many miners today do not rely on a
single overlay node to obtain transactions (and indeed often rely on a separate,
faster mining backbone to propagate blocks), we believe that this figure cannot
directly inform reparametrization discussions. It is illustrative of other metrics,
however, that may be important but difficult to measure. Consequently, until
the Bitcoin system undergoes fundamental protocol changes, gradual or conservative
parameter changes may be prudent.

See stats and richlists
@_date: 2016-03-31 15:41:24
Well no, quite the opposite. The paper does not say that 4MB is safe, but it says that more is quite clearly unsafe. Which is why with segwit, the block size should be at maximum 1MB at present, because an adversary could create 4MB blocks in this environment.
@_date: 2016-03-08 13:58:00

This is very interesting, but it only shows that you can build any circuit in script. The point of Turing completeness, though,  is that it implies the halting problem. That is, given a program in a Turing complete language, it is undecidable if this program will ever stop on any input. It is easy to see why this would be an undesirable property for a bitcoin script.

@_date: 2019-03-16 18:50:28
I haven't studied channel factories in detail, but I suppose there is coordination (as in co-signing) necessary at least for opening it. In a group of 1000 people, there will always be someone who tries to delay things, or whose computer just crashed. Also, there will always be someone wanting to close to chain, making the whole thing pointless. 
But I guess these are organizational questions. There might be ways of automating these decisions that make sizes like this possible. But then you would lose trustlessness again.

If that minimum wage was needed or useful is a very different question. As is what is super rich.
But 35 Bitcoins is about 124k EUR, which at least 500k people in Germany could easily afford. That is what OP's comment was about. 
Of course, if they all tried to buy those bitcoins, 35 bitcoins would quickly be worth way more ...

First paragraph: Appears you are.
The second paragraph is provably incorrect. See this [video](

Third: I don't know what unpoad means, but yes, that was a goal when Blockstream was founded. It is now much less clear that this is even feasible. Most core devs seem to be quite worried about sidechain security  these days.
Fourth: The claim doesn't make much sense to me, since sidechains also wouldn't give Blockstream any income, but they are highly invested personally and as a company in Bitcoin itself. But it is impossible to prove or disprove, of course. 
Is anyone worried? I would say most bitcoiners are cautious about any large stakeholders, but so far Blockstream hasn't done anything worth worrying about. On the contrary, they have been a great source of science and progress in bitcoin.

For the LN, it's probably a net negative because it makes routing less reliable. For bitcoin, it won't add much to the network. So I think you should only do it when you need it for a secure, private wallet --- on- or offchain. Just make your channels private.

I have not seen this point made, but I think it's important since you 
seem to be looking for reasons against an extra block size increase: segwit makes the total maximum block size including witnesses - block weight - 4 MB already. If you now additionally want to increase the old block size without witnesses to 2 MB but within segwit 's new weight structure, you get a new max block weight of 8 MB. And we do know that 8 MB is NOT a safe block size in the current network from a paper that has almost every security researcher in bitcoin as co-authors. That is the technical point. 
The social point is that we are trying for a block size increase with segwit and the detractors keep saying : we won't accept segwit because we need a block size increase. Doesn't that strike you as insincere?

Interesting. What have you read about Armory? Two things I don't like about the code base are that it isn't actively developed at the moment and it's written in python, which to me always has the taste of a rapid prototype. But so is Electrum and Electrum server. As I said above you can run your own Electrum server and it needs a running bitcoind full node as a precondition. I don't quite understand your question. I have tried running such a server and gave up after a few days of tinkering. It's not fun if you're not into python, and it requires even more resources than a full node. Copay or bitcore-wallet might be interesting alternatives (in Javascript),  but they they require running bitcore-wallet-service (or trusting a public one), a similar server running on top of bitcoind. This one appears a  bit more professionally designed to me, but I haven't tried running it.

At the moment in order to have some chance to preserve privacy you need to  have your own full node. This usually means bitcoind. You might investigate running this through Tor. Then there are several possibilities for the wallet itself: Bitcoinqt or Armory, or you run your own Electrum server or bitcore-wallet-service. Then you can point your Electrum, bitcore-wallet or copay at your own server. As someone said before in this thread: privacy is hard.

1. this isn't about who is the good guy but about legal technicalities. 
2. the judges often have no clue about the topic. 
3. in Internet cases in Germany, the sueing party gets to choose the court (because the Internet is everywhere - really, it's that dumb), and there are courts that are known for being real assholes.

I would recommend you look at [bitcoinprivacy's richlist]( as well as [statistics]( which are up-to-date to the latest block. 
I don't see how you get from 7 million wallets to 600k-2m owners, though. In fact, it is very hard to say. There are about 10m non-empty addresses right now. However, this is neither a lower nor an upper bound to the number of users or even wallets, since firstly entities like coinbase hold millions of users' coins in probably much less wallets, and secondly, there are people who own thousands of addresses. 
It does, however, cast doubt on blockchain.info's assertion that they have more than 8 million users (if I remember that claim correctly).

We can't really know, since addresses are not wallets and wallets are not people, but looking at addresses and partially inferred wallets paints a different picture that what you assume: [bitcoinprivacy.net ](
The gini coefficient is a measure of inequality with 0 perfectly equal and 1 perfectly inequal. Really bad countries have ginis up to 0.66. Bitcoin has 0.99 and this has been rising since we started  measuring it in about 2013. 
I do hope we made a mistake in calculating it, because it just seems so bad. Can anyone verify this independently?
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:13:59
Don't worry, I've done enough research. But maybe you should DYOR, so you don't fall for scams like Idiota. Or are you even one of the scammers yourself?

well, their "normal" matching service works wherever there is Amazon. However, I wouldn't recommend it after receiving a letter from the police myself. The people at purse.io were quite helpful in dealing with this, but I don't understand why they don't start verifying seller identities in order to avoid this in the first place.

You're right, I'm just going to give you the same clearly proven facts that every scientific expert in the field has told you, and you will just tell me again that it has all been debunked by some shill on a forum.
I don't know the person you are referring to personally, so I can't say if anything you say about her is true. What I do know is that Idiota is a scam. I've read the whitepaper maybe 2 years ago and I remember thinking, that's an interesting DIY project, but there's no reason why this would work. After that, the red flags just started flying... Trinary? Build your own crypto? Microsoft? Bosch? Aggressive shills everywhere? And then they really got owned by the DCI, but instead of saying thank you for teaching us our place they doubled down with an anti science furor not seen since Onecoin. I've had discussions with their head shill Limo claiming Idiota works on a partitioned network. There isn't a red flag in the world that this project hasn't raised.

Blockchain is a red herring. It's like explaining the revolution by saying "but these nice pitchforks that we use are really shiny!"
@_date: 2015-11-12 09:03:31
It might appear correct to you, but that doesn't make it so. Moreover, an axiom is something you assume to be correct without being able to prove it, mainly because you wish it were so. I wonder why you wish this to be true. Maybe because you found a "solution" that makes sense under this assumption? 
Well I neither wish this axiom to be true not do I find it convincing that it is.  Neither did Satoshi. Because you just reinvented representative democracy and at the same time claimed that there is no alternative to it. Yet the whole idea of bitcoin is an alternative to this old way of doing things. 
I really love your videos, but this time I think you got it wrong.
@_date: 2016-05-21 06:33:17
I once thought like this, too. But when you think about it a little more you will see that most of these notarization ideas are not really interesting. 
In this case, the central DB already exists, and gives meaning to the hashes,  something the blockchain cannot do. That is extra human work anyway. And, given that it is supposedly public, there is no trust needed, as well. You just need some person checking a hash or copy of the DB from time to time. Archive.org, git etc. Have been existing for a long time. So abusing the blockchain for this is not necessary and does not add anything new.

That is a good point. To us it is obvious that it is a scam, but we need to get better at finding irrefutable arguments for that. 
This case, however, is mostly about linking to official notices from the banking authority in Germany. If that is illegal, we have real problems.
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:25:30
This has nothing at all to do with bitcoin (except for the title), nor even with any blockchain. It's just that some medical doctor has discovered the concept of hashing. Well, it seems hashing is the technology behind bitcoin. True dat.

This has nothing to do with HD wallets. However, there are techniques to infer that different addresses belong to the same wallet. See our [FAQ]( for details.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:07:30
38185 times 50 btc (a lot of satoshi's I think)
2027 times 25 btc.

good point.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:39:38
Closures is our term for partial wallets. That is, groups of addresses that seem to belong to the same entity, according to some heuristic. See FAQ for details.
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:50:19
very interesting idea ... we will think about it ...
@_date: 2015-02-10 10:46:28
yeah, it's not really clear what this means, but the number is astonishingly small, isn't it? yet these are almost all bitcoins ... 
but you are right, there could be millions of 2-btc-holders with blockchain/coinbase accounts, and there might just be a thriving micropayments economy that needs no more than 2% of bitcoins. who knows?
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:23:43
almost... No, in fact we are two.
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:08:00
There seems to be a common misunderstanding that HD wallets are necessary to have multiple addresses in a wallet. That is not the case. The only practical difference with HD wallets is that it is easier to back them up. 
HD or not, grouping the addresses from a wallet using the blockchain alone is hard. Our search tries to do this using a well-known algorithm (group addresses that occur together in a tx input). There are others that we hope to incorporate soon. However, by carefully choosing your outputs and never reusing addresses when spending, you can do a pretty good job of keeping information leakage low.
In the distribution feature we only look at addresses, and you are right that the information this yields is limited. It is neither a lower bound on the number of PEOPLE owning that many bitcoin (because there could be just one person owning all these addresses), nor is it an upper bound (coinbase could be owning all these addresses and could be hiding millions of users behind them). 
But it is a step towards a discussion about the issues involved, don't you think?
@_date: 2015-02-10 11:38:39
If that was the case, then the millions of accounts that at least blockchain and coinbase claim would hold basically nothing. Moreover, would it really make their systems more secure if they held a million keys instead of one?

top 1000, actually
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:10:18
well, they were first, but [ours]( is up-to-date, handles multisig addresses correctly (many of the top hodlers use these nowadays), and has not just the top addresses, but the top closures (hodling entities, see our FAQ), too.
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:16:18
Actually, I tried and it isn't easy (well, it's easy but it takes forever). We'll generate the necessary indices to do queries like this quickly in the future, but meanwhile it's probably easier to immediately check our site whenever he publishes fresh data. 
The oldest stats I could find was from block 342549. Back then we had 4,342,144 positive balance addresses, and 63,725,955 overall addresses. I suppose we do have more addresses than he does.
This might be because he throws away more than we do - there are lots of special cases when parsing the blockchain. But it's hard to say, because I didn't find his source code.
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:08:40
sure, but I believe what he meant is clustering addresses, which is independent of HD wallets.
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:21:24
not really. there are almost 14 million btc, most of them in addresses with more than 2 btc.
But I don't think that there are that many "big" holders on coinbase. Might be another 100000, though.
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:55:44
well, not a lot of that, since almost 98% of bitcoins are already accounted for in adresses with more than 2 btc. Only about 300.000 bitcoins left, so no more than 150.000 "big" hodlers can be missing.
@_date: 2015-02-10 10:34:44
I thought it was 100 million. Whatever. A lot ;)

This is where I stopped reading seriously:


Well, no. It's 2^64 -1, but I'll give him that. I didn't even know it's finite. And it is for a technical reason that isn't interesting at all. So why does he mention this wrong and absolutely irrelevant fact?
 


No, this is ridiculous. Assuming x bits, that would be 2^x possible messages.
I refuse to believe a CS genius can't do elementary combinatorics. And then there's this ...




What does that even mean? And combinatorics isn't a process, but a field of mathematics. And somehow I don't think anything about this elementary calculcation could be found in a book by Lazlo Lovasz, if this book even exists.

RemindMe! 3 months "how many 1 bitcoin addresses?"
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:16:31
you're right with blockchain, as pointed out. But coinbase, I'm not so sure. There could be 1 million accounts on coinbase each holding 2 bitcoins, and we probably wouldn't see it on the blockchain. And in their case, I don't think the security is different whether they hold, say 1000 or 1000000 different keys.
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:53:53
wow, that website does basically the same thing as our search. I didn't know we had any "competition" there. thanks for pointing that out. also, calling it wallets is a nice idea. we call these closures, but really they are partial wallets.
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:49:25
Thank you very much. 
I can't check right now but will ASAP. 
I just realized we should be off by about 2600 BTC, because that is the amount in non-decodable addresses, and we group that into one pseudo address. Would that explain the difference?

I disagree. Running a full node is its own reward, because it's the only private and secure way of sending, receiving, and storing bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:51:46
No, we don't. That said, we easily could, and you are rightfully paranoid. We invite you to use a VPN, TOR, or download our source code and build your own DB.

Well, it is faster and cheaper. You might have a point about the sd cards. We'll see how long it lasts.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:27:58
Sure, a pruned node is still a fully verifying node, and it can still help distribute new blocks and transactions. Of course, a full archival node is even better, but I think the network would be fine with relatively few of these.
@_date: 2015-02-10 11:19:39
Well, there are about 47957 addresses with exactly 1 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:22:09
Indeed. But I've been thinking of working towards that...
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:59:41
Well, they are about 13,077,980 of 17,068,519 UTXOs overall (about because these two figures have been calculated at slightly different times). This is about 77%, but the UTXOs are really only a very small part of the block chain anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-10 09:51:47
why 7 millions?
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:26:00
A full node itself doesn't earn fees. If this becomes a routing Lightning node, it could earn some, but then you'd also need to put some funds on it.
