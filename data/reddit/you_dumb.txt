What do you care, you're cashing out on the bitcoin communities graces as well. Bet you pay yourself a nice chunk of that untraceable money for all your "charity" work.

I wasn't aware more information was released beyond his own confession.

That guy is a scumbag who uses donations as his personal wallet. Fuck him.

This. Whatever they decide to do with the bitcoin is unrelated to you.
You do need to follow your states MSB laws outlined by FinCEN, these are the rules and unless you want to face criminal punishment you should play their game.

Homeless are the last people anyone should be contributing time or money towards helping. They are in the situation they are because of their own unwillingness to play the shit hand they were dealt. They'll never make an effort to improve their life because charity and handouts are much easier.
Suffice it to say, people with mental disabilities or children who were abandoned by family are of actual concern. They can't help themselves, they're at the mercy of those who care.

Us using his image is not the same as Newsweek printing a dangerous story about him.
People will continue to use his face regardless, and I think it's an important part of bitcoin culture now but also a reminder that news agencies that are driven by "big scoops" like this are something bitcoin will destroy.
When people are no longer paying for news subscriptions but instead tipping the journalist directly, we'll have a change in quality.

For example sake lets say you got 1BTC each time. You now have 4BTC. When you make a purchase totaling 3.5 BTC, the QT client will grab the coins from both addresses as input, then output to two addresses. The first will be the recipient (3.5 BTC) and the second will be change (0.5 BTC) into a new address you've never used. All these addresses are stored in your wallet.dat file.
The QT client does this automatically. There's no added benefit of sending your bitcoin into different addresses, the idea is not to reuse an address after spending its inputs. If you have not spent any bitcoin from that address, I see no issue in continuing to receive other than people know how much BTC you have or you don't get the benefit of having a permanent address to reference for each transaction.

Yep, I got it. Running on MacOS 10.9, though I'm on testnet.
I'm running at a 2560x1600 and the BTC, mBTC, µBTC dropdown is improperly aligned vertically as well as all the button's text.

Not listing your addresses.
You have to leave the request form empty, then check the "Reuse an existing receiving address", click "Request Payment" and it lists your addresses.
It's actually kind of annoying, most newbies don't even use the QT client so they're just making power users job more difficult.

Except that dude is guilty of knowingly laundering tens of thousands of dollars.

He only denied it once it was realized they were building a case against him.
By his own words, friends told him not to speak with the feds and he willingly gave up information anyways. Possibly under some naive assumption that his cooperation would undo the part where he knowingly broke some serious laws.
I'd consider myself an optimist, but he's fucked.
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:36:23
Your "question" is very confusing.
Are you moving the bitcoin you purchase through coinbase into a cold storage address? The general consensus is to never reuse addresses. Once you eventually spend a portion of the stored bitcoin, you should move the remainder (change) into a new, unused address. Most bitcoin clients do this automatically, and give users a *wallet.dat* file filled with addresses they own.
People who receive payments at a fixed bitcoin address typically move them after confirmation into another address, or just spend them from that address. This is not advised.

I don't think anybody gives a shit what anyone else says. People will continue to use his likeliness, quotes, etc. He is forever immortalized into bitcoin culture.
Trying to stop this is like trying to take a picture off of the internet. All you can do is hope that every site that hosted the image eventually disappears.

If it gets more people who would otherwise not give a shit interested in bitcoin, then I'm all for it.
It's their first step into the economy, and as long as they're spending their bitcoin like everyone else it makes no difference.
@_date: 2014-04-17 00:07:58
You just lost a sale for being retarded.

I've seen those interviews. There was someone on Silk Road reselling bitcoin through bitinstant. They would have the buyer make the deposit, then purchase bitcoin from mtgox and transfer it to the SR buyers address.
Charlie knowingly circumvented bitinstants own guidelines, while hiding it from his partner, to continue helping the SR seller launder bitcoin.

He's running a business, this may come as a shock to you but businesses thrive on profits. He has investors standing behind him as well, it's in his best interests to bring them high profit margins.
That said, this is the first time I've seen him interviewed. He seems well spoken and I'm glad that the bitcoin scene in China is being spearheaded by someone knowledgable in both markets.
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:05:08
Exactly. I've been making the same point every time this stupid-ass argument comes up.
The symbol to denominate bitcoin has been decided by the community already. If people wanted to change it, they would. Satoshi himself liked the idea of B with intersecting vertical line, so in the spirit of paying respects to the creator why don't we stop worrying about this ridiculously unimportant aspect of bitcoin.
