The least of anyone’s worries who is in the situation I am describing.  And most people in general.  It’s the same tax rate as any other income.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:54:11
So because someone knows that income tax is a thing, they know about investing???  Lol.  Stop, you’re really looking stupid now.

I have $6000 sitting in my savings account.  Complete was of money as it just sits there earning jack shit, huge opportunity cost.
I’m already in the normal stock market through my 401k, so putting my personal savings in there is redundant and boring.
I’m not about to risk my entire savings, but I can risk a third of it, so I bought $2000 worth.
I still have my savings, and now some of it is actually doing something, and growing.

It's not like you traded 10,000 bitcoins for 2 pizzas or something.

TurboTax:  Did you earn any additional income other than wages on your W2.
Filer:  Yes
TurboTax:  OK, from where and how much?
Filer:  Bitcoin Exchange and $1000
TurboTax:  OK
Damn that was hard!

Lol wow.  First off, you shouldn’t look at the price increase as your means for determining gain.  You should look at the % increase.
Take the % increase which is 1.071% and then multiply by your $1000.  Voila.

You’ve edited the same comment 3 times now.  You’re really coming off autistic by trying to act like you’re dropping profound knowledge that literally everyone knows and understands.
They can withdraw their original investment + extra from their gains to completely cover the taxation if they wanted to.
Sit down.

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:38:33
Why should I explain that income is taxed?  This is common knowledge, and is literally plastered everywhere you invest...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:27:35
Lol terrible advice
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:59:24
This is you saying that people in /new don’t know about income tax:


Then this is your follow up saying that if I’m right and that everyone knows about income taxes, then who is my post for:


So yes, that’s exactly what you’re saying.
Please, you’re embarrassing yourself...
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:28:12
The same reason people aren’t investing now.  We can’t see the future.  Hindsight is always 20/20.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:02:49
Now you’re conflating the content they want on the sub as some sort of validation lol.
Stay stupid ✌��

It’ll obviously fail.  Use your head.

I’m blaming your retardation on you.  Literally everyone knows about income taxes.  You could’ve avoided coming off like a pretentious cocksucker by simply stating “It’s worth reminding everyone about the income tax implications.”
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:02:46
Lol good joke!

Hey thanks!  Didn’t even notice!
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:33:44
Lol those two situations aren’t even remotely comparable.  What a dumb post.
