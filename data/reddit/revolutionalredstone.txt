You completely misunderstand - like everyone else : P 
The users, the money and the exchanges are all absolutely irrelevant to the system...
The actual bitcoin protocol is used only by the miners - they are the mutually distrustful parties which must somehow agree upon which changes shall be made to the global ledger.
The way they do this involves exchanging the answers to very-difficult mathematics problems, amazingly the process ONLY works internationally - if two countries each implemented their-own cryptocurrency networks - then neither would work... It needs to be global !
TL:DR Bitcoin really was the first distributed trustless decision system ever implemented.

That's a bugger !, we all like to hope our teachers are competent : )

I imagine maryamtah didn't specifically mention that the wallet id is a public key -otherwise he might have understood. ( the name wallet-id does not really imply it's use )

Writing the cryptocurrency wiki page i was amazed by the sheer level of ignorance present in so many people...
I think there IS a real barrier to understanding - bitcoin is fundamentally a trust-less communications protocol and that may place it as a concept simply beyond many peoples ability to understand.

Yeah, just the general awesomeness of the idea.
