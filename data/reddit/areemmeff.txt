Tax is never a miniscule part of your salary and you saying that proves that you have no idea what you're talking about. The more you earn the more you pay dum dum. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:29:36
There's going to be a time that it doesn't go back up. That's just a fact. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:34:47
I'm just wondering why you don't simply reset your password. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:28:30
Who cares? I thought this dumb fad of trying to be first to post died out over a decade ago. Get with the times man. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:22:55
There aren't and never will be enough bitcoin for that to work. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:11:42
Just dropped under 6000 euros.
The sky is falling. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:18:25
Boom! :) 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:12:39
Wow, going down fast.Well, it had to happen sooner or later. Hope all of you guys got out before its all gone.

And this is exactly why normal every day people like your grandmother will never adopt this.
People want to put their money somewhere and not worry about updating software yada yada yada to make sure that its secure and that they can access it without a hacker stealing it.
That's not anywhere close to what you get with bitcoin. It's a fucking joke.
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:16:23
I didn't think so. I think he sounds just fine.
Go outside and talk to people. You may actually come across someone who has a different accent to you. It's not annoying, it's diversity. It's a good thing dummy. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:55:45
The amount of weeks on reddit has nothing to do with anything he said in his post.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:22:30
Heard "Hey this is" POWERSURGE"
.... and closed at less than 10 seconds. 
Sounds like a malfunctioning super hero.
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:27:06
Aren't these jokes played out by now?
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:10:38
Mine says thats too optimistic. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:08:39
This is such a stupid point of view. Retarded really. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:35:10
McAfee says what he needs to say to get more people to buy in to bitcoin. Its that simple. He doesn't believe his 1 million claims, but he's hoping that others will.
Nothing more, nothing less. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:50:35
Not yet. A couple of thousand more downwards and you'll have found your bottom. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:53:42
It's in a death spiral. Accept it. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:50:19
That just doesn't seem worth the effort. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:33:38
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:10:42
I think it's sound advice.
This dude should cut his losses and sell before he ends up homeless. 
Unless, he really has an understanding of the tech and an unshakable belief that its going to recover. In which case, hold. 
Personally speaking, I think he should get out now and preserve the thing that he has above his head that keeps the rain and the cold off his back whilst he sleeps. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:05:19
Why on earth would anyone want to own this? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:08:12
Looks shit. And pointless. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:18:17
Mel Gibson? Didn't he get famous from insulting the Jews? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:35:18
So you consider only the people who refuse to abandon the sinking ship and drown with you to be your only true friends? Maybe it's you who isn't the true friend. I don't know, I'm just thinking out loud. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:53:13
I don't want to be negative and I know that this is off topic but I can't for the life of me understand why any grown adult would want to wear something with a stupid meme slogan or something with anything on it related to bitcoin. I'm sure people can already see that they're nerds without wearing something so goofy.
Which brings me to another point. The bitcoin symbol/logo is stupid looking as well. I think it should be reworked in order to be taken seriously. It looks like it's out of a 1950s comic book.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:38:22
Listen to yourself. Read what you just typed and let's leave it here.

Star wars reference. Listen to you I will not.... /Yoda
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:36:28
Dude. Sell everything and move on to something else. I don't think this is for you. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:18:15
Bag holders? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:17:05
I don't know. Don't care. Actually that's not true I hope he cashed out, but I also hope that he in the end gets a fucking education.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:24:08
You would have been better buying yesterday or the night before. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:27:43
This repetitious nonsense is getting old. Buy the dip.. Hold.
It's nonsense. There's absolutely no reason to assume that the value will significantly appreciate from here. In fact, the ATH in December that sucked everyone in to lose their money almost certainly insures that it'll never get there again. People are wary of it now and rightfully so. 
If you want to gamble that's up to you. But maybe you shouldn't be encouraging other people to throw their money away to improve your own chances of making a profit. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:00:58
May come with overheating and artifact issues. But maybe not, it's a roll of the dice. Much like investing in bitcoin I guess only with less to lose. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:29:45
Hardly a risk. A 12 year old gambling with grandmas money had absolutely zero idea that it would ever amount to anything. Let's be realistic. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:21:12
That's bullshit. It was a couple of dollars a bitcoin back then. He wasn't risking anything other than his allowance for doing his chores. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:20:18
May be is one word.
I'm sorry for pointing that out. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:08:54
Personally, I think it'll be gone in 10 years.
That's just my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:44:47
I think that the point is that the vast majority of people who have become millionaires, driving Lamboughs....
They all just got lucky. And now it's reversing. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:42:02
He read it in his tea leaves. My crystal ball disagrees though. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:46:26
How far left? 19K left? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:25:14
It's people enjoying seeing the smug 19 year old with the R8 that did nothing other than get lucky get his comeuppance and want to see the little shit have to go to college :p
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:21:55
And by the way, it's still an unknown. A very expensive unknown. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:44:14
I agree.
Personally I think that this is a really bad idea. In 14 years its going to be worthless. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:22:33
Buy the car. Follow through on your goal. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:30:39
You "hope".
I'm sending thoughts and prayers your way. 
But if this is how you predict your investments, maybe don't think them out loud online and potentially influence readers of this sub reddit to make poor decisions based on your thoughts. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:21:08
Probably not going to happen. My guess is that it's going down. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:31:03
Yes. Absolutely useless for payment method for anything meaningful. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:36:30
How original. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:48:34
The value of 1 bitcoin is not one bloody bitcoin. Its what you can buy for it in real world terms that's the value. I'm tired of hearing this dumb mantra over and over.
Such a retarded point of view and only recited over and over to get other people who are losing real world value hand over fist to hold onto theirs. 
When it hits zero don't worry fella, because your 1 bitcoin will still be worth 1 bitcoin.
Pffff. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:45:47
Again, this retarded mantra. "1btc is worth 1btc"
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:57:59
I agree with you completely. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:17:06
Upvoted. Completely agree with you on this. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:51:05
Anyone else getting tired of the constant regurgitation of these quotes and idiotic memes?
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:43:35
It's over. Down from now on out. I'm sorry but if you think about the last 4 months realistically and from an unbiased perspective you have to realise that the moon has been and gone.
And just like NASA, we're not going back. There are no investors left to fund it. 
It's over. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:37:40
50k. Lol.
Keep dreaming and keep on hodling on then champ. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:23:16
Agreed. Until its sub 1000 at least. Which it will be. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:34:43
I'm not saying you think this, I'm really not, but most of the people talking about bitcoin going to the moon seem to not realise that it has already mooned and its never going to reach those heights again.
The general public got pulled in at the end of last year and the people that recognised it cashed out around the ATH.
Im pretty sure that can never happen again after all of the negative publicity of the crash. 
It's over. I'm sure of it. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:13:44
Why? It's a crappy piece of "art"
You must be emotionally all in on bitcoin if this represents something meaningful to you. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:49:42
Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:13:14
I think 3k is more likely actually.
