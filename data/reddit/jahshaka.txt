so read it here and trying to figure out what i can do to support the real bitcon 
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:21:56
cant beleive no one has done this yet... too many people making money of the BTC BCH war they dont realize the no one here is really fighting just being gouged - i would live to spam the BCH mempool how do i do that ???
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:55:54
use the calculator at  it backups up all exchange rates on a blockchain so you can look them up and share them 
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:56:01
works perfectly for me - jusdt too many people signing up i think and people complaining they cant get accounts opened - coinbase users are defecting there
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:40:03
shes totally so hot
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:25:35
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:53:54
this would give GMO a big bump up for their new mining facility.... 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:14:51
are there real BCH transactions happening ?
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:11:30
the current developers are doing a great job of scaling bitcoin - Bcash uses their work just shows... what you are saying is all FUD the market has grown so big so fast everyone wants a piece if it for themself is whats happening
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:14:11
just heard it many times, here and other forums - so trying to understand why its done and how its done... and if its being done shouldnt it be returned in kind ?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:00:17
added my request to remove bitcoin.com
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:56:43
where is anonymous when you need them...
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:01:56
Dont have a screenshot but it started at 9:15 on the 18th, you can see their twitter post here which made it out as a 
 technical update (strange day for a update to the pool) 
 
All Bitcoin miners immediatly got kicked off the pool and only 20% of our miners - at random - could reconnect over a 18 hour window after their tweet... 
what was weird was, if 20% of miners could connect then the pool was up and running ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:14
we really need to get this message to the exchanges they are the ones spreading this FUD buy not listing it as Bcash and creating the confusion around it. they have the full power to list it as Bcash no one and nothing is stopping them from doing so.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:01:42
yes if you love BTC and are mining on any other pool than slush you are an idiot plain and simple.. as antpool cripples BTC mining whenever they are doing their bchash pumps
cant wait for GMO to release their chips and take a huge bite out of Bitmain - their mining is up and running so that means chips are in production
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:58:24
The bitcoin core developers are managing a codebase responsible for billions of dollars and so cant just rush out solutions... they need to be properly vetted, tested, debugged, tested, vetted again etc before they can do releases. While this takes time it maintains a stable platform which is what everyone wants. This is money 2.0 after all.
This also means they cant just roll out quick fixes, like a 8mb block size, that make the system anti-competitive - the 8mb block size gives BCash a 1 TB + blockchain that makes it only possible for large companies to run the nodes that support the ecosystem.
While this means we cant hack the block size to reduce transaction fees, and maintain a open platform, they have come up with amazing 2nd layer solutions to address these issues with segwit and lightening - if they had the full support of the community we would see these solutions get to end users much faster.
instead what we see is greedy people using these issues as reasons to 'fork' bitcoin and essentially release their own currencies so they can profit off of mis-information. Bcash is just that... a corporate controlled fork.
just hang in there, segwit is already being rolled out large scale and over the next few months lightening will address the issue of transaction fees which will make BCash and many of the alt-coins that sprung up to capitalize on this weakness pretty much dead in the water
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:26:45
yes they are awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:55:29
thats not even the half of it - all Bitcoin miners on Antpool were also disconnected for a "network upgrade" very sneakily... encouraging people to switch over to Bcash mining. not sure how this fits in but for a pool that has 20% if the mining power this must of had a significant effect on bitcoin and bcash mining 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:50:42
theres only one bitcoin !!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:51:16
yes your are correct i guess they added it recently wasnt there before... the need to call it Bcash however going to email their CEO feel free to chip in his email is nejc.kodric
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:11
regulation is important - but in a open market then we have to be the regulators... we need to support the vision that started all of this and stick to our ethics. Bitcoin is changing the world and making it a better place, we cant let greedy people stand in the way of that ???
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:32:13
i could not agree with him more
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:58:42
slushpool rocks - they give you a share of the transaction fees as well as the mining rewards... they also let you vote on new bitcoin technology implementations
anyone mining bitcoin on antpool is a idiot
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:12:39
bitmex is really screwing bitcoin Hodlers.. shorters paradise over there powered by Buffet and crew
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:32:44

@_date: 2018-08-22 16:13:28
bitmex is bad for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:31:45
they are backed by criminals - just like the caribbean and every where else where politicians are gods and will fight to keep control of their fiefdoms... and everyone bows to them. bitcoin is their biggest fear - i know this having consulted to a central bank
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:34:09
well he went from 'interesting' to shitting on it - dont make sense for someone with his brians
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:35:06
how does babies brains fit in in this scenario...
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:34:09
Not sure - trying to figure it out here.... would like to help any way I can 
@_date: 2018-10-04 11:04:21
at least bcash has a green logo....
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:06:22
yes really sucks - circle was a great tool now its a dead tool really...
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:19:57
awesome - more exchanges need to do this to get rid of the confusion
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:59:27
if i had $7.5 mil to invest right now i would drop it on bitstamp like its hot
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:51:28
yes its bitmain - S9 / T9 etc and now lightcoin and dash miners as well
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:42:35
Well they are shorting the fuck out of it for sure - backed by bill gates and his mate Warren 
@_date: 2016-12-26 17:12:08
is it  ? how do you find out ?
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:42:06
I remember when it hit 70b just last year and everyone was blown away - chill and relax and go for the ride
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:50:59
so everyone crys that bitmain owns the market - and yet there are really no alternatives ? we are looking to put $2 million in a mining farm and cant get hardware anywhere...
@_date: 2018-06-06 10:32:46
Awesome lets fork bitcoin into bitcoin pure now !!
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:27:36

Go Jack major props - good to see some tech market leaders contributing to financial inclusion instead of creating their own coins
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:02:14
function of government in most of the world is to take your money and spend it on.... government! Where I live the politicians are gods who drive the most expensive cars, spend tax money on drugs and prostitutes, fly around the world first class
all while the lower class struggles, poor kids live on the road side and cant get food to eat...
the system is broken and its driven by fiat as there is no transparency in what they do and how they do it
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:47:27
how are they going to stop me from using bitcoin - we saw this happen to the music industry with bittorrent - how are they going to stop anyone ?
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:20:17
So since BTC.com, Antpool and bitcoin.com are all owned by the same conglomerate - and already have over 40% of the BCash hash rate combined - how real is this ? I am sure they own a large part of the 40% 'unknown' as well ?
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:15:41
Banks are spending millions to bear claw bitcoin down - they hold tons and every time it goes up they sell and drive the price down then buy back to restock - and so on and so on... remember it’s their biggest enemy and they have massive warchests
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:57:18
but i really dont need fiat any more do i 
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:16:51

About time we come out with a 'bitcoin card' and just take the credit card guys on - a OSS standard for cards that link to your lightening node and a easy way to sign them for micro payments like NFC
then get that standard added to multilink
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:04:28
What’s the cost of running a b cash node vs a bitcoin node 
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:37:50
they are scammers with a lot of money pushing bcash down peoples throats... but more and more people realize bcash is useless now that we have segwit and lightening so it will die a slow death
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:56:01
so basically its a scammer coin created by scammers for scammers to scam people with... heh
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:46:49
A few people have told me that Banks are trading bitcoin down in a last ditch attempt to kill it  - anyway to find if there is any truth in this ?
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:55:32
Why doesn’t Tim take on roger and start buying BTC assets ? Like bitcoin . com ? Need some of these whales out there helping to fight the bcash propaganda machine 
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:27:22
Woohoo finally!!! Go Twitter
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:38:54
Great news but downvoted because bitcoin.com
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:03:25
and bitcoin cash...
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:06:36
i remember buying miners from them over a year ago and being forced to buy bcash in order to place my orders as it was all they accepted... had to sell bitcoin to buy their shitty coin
so i guess they also got burnt on hardware orders as well then, not just speculation, if they didnt sell and just held 
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:00:51
not fast enough... but it really fucked bitmain
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:25:51
this was inevitable... but it was a fun place to hang out while it lasted !!!
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:54:18
bcash taking him down - hes a  idiot had he stuck behind bitcoin he would be flying high instead of trying to rip it off
