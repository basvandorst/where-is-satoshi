Thank you, i am contacting a lawyer as soon as i can, but i dont have much experience into sueing someone. I dont even know that kind of lawyer do i need to find. 
I posted here with the hope that someone else had been in this situation and managed to get out.

What could be suspicious ? I put bitcoin in account, sell it then withdraw it. Thats all i do.
I am a little panicked about releasing funds. When they say "it may take 24-48 hours to respond to your ticket" and it takes 2 weeks, then when they say it may take several weeks to complete the investigation, should i expect a few years ?
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:26:06
Sure but i don't think it is the case since i haven't done anything ilegal. From my point of view this is an abuse from kraken generated from their lack of caring about their clients or maybe intentional from various reasons which i will try and abstain speculating on.
@_date: 2016-04-01 09:29:34
I think kraken (and any other companies) should learn a little bit about transparency.
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:57:09
In september. Investigation still didnt reach a conclusion. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 07:23:45
This is actually a helpfull comment. Too bad it has to come from a random user on reddit, while kraken can't tell me any information about why am i investigated.
I can show you a print screen of a support ticket when i have waited almost 2 weeks for a response.
Also i don't fit any of your reasons. 
* Problems with feds ?? Not the case.
* The bank i withdraw to is very communicative and open with me as i am with them. They know what i do and they are ok with that.  
* Never used a mixer.
* I don't know if they are blacklisted or not. I just receive the bitcoins and after a few confirmations i pay the client. It's not rocket science, i can't understand where they could have the "irregularities" .

Im sure they aren't some cheap scammers, but it isn't unheard for big companies to pull sh*t like that. Scamming would be if they stripped me of my money or not allowing me access to them, but that is illegal. When big companies want to scam you they don't just delete your account and forget you exist, they "put your account on hold due to some investigations" (that of course can't be exactly named) for "an undetermined ammount of time" .
Probably this is not the case in this situation, but right now i am pretty panicked about my money.
@_date: 2016-04-01 08:13:58
Due to the nature of the bitcoin, i really don't think is possible for them to check if the btc come from illegal activities and if it is possible to check then i really don't have access to that kind of technology(not sure if even kraken has).
@_date: 2016-04-01 06:00:12
From what i see they removed my post from their subreddit. It seems they dont like this kind of attention.
@_date: 2016-04-01 16:27:26
That makes sense. I will post another LE that i think would matter in a few hours. Its about the tier 4 verification. That i think it might be the problem. 
I was asked there to give an estimate about my monthly volume and i notice that my account was locked when i was 200$ away from crossing it, but that shouldn't be enough reason to suspend my account. Since they dont want to specify the problem and the investigation si unilateral, i can only guess, but it seems plausible.
@_date: 2016-04-16 20:16:16
I will update myself the post when i get more informations. I guess it was because of one of my clients who probably is LE investigated. I don't know enough myself yet.
@_date: 2016-04-01 11:08:00
Your comment actually made me laugh. Thank you, in such an intense situation for me, it really helped.
@_date: 2016-04-01 09:25:42
I think it should be normal for me to be at least informed about what is the problem in order for me to be able to respond. I **really** believe i have the right to reply when **my** money is on hold.
And regarding your list :
1. I connect from multiple places (phone/laptop/pc/public wifis/vpn on my laptop). So if there is a compromise account problem based on the ips i connect from then i can provide you proofs that it is me.
2. I really dont think is the case of anything from this list (never sent a deposit so no chargeback/i can confirm my identity by any means you want/fraud again i don't think is the case/money laundering - again not the case / criminal activity (yeah my btcs were behind 9/11) / LE demand - i think they would first come to me to ask questions if they had a problem and i would gladly respond any questions they had).
3. I don't understand exactly what do you mean by this point.
4. As i have mentioned in a comment here, i know someone who had the account suspended, but i don't think just knowing someone is enough to suspend my account too, **or is it??**
Thank you very much for your reply, but i also would like a REAL amount of time that it will take you to conclude your investigation and also i have to be included on your investigation, because being judged in your absence and without a reply right just isn't cool.
@_date: 2016-04-01 08:07:19
Of course this is what i'm going to do. I haven't posted this to defame them or to throw some accusations, nor to get ready for a legal process. 
I wanted to get advice from people who have been in this situation and also to create a topic for people to search when they will be in this situation. I only found 2-3 similar topics on internet and they haven't been very helpful.
Also, talking to a lawyer about this is not a bad idea even if my intentions are to co-operate and sort this out.
@_date: 2016-04-01 16:57:38
From an EU-based country. I would like to not specify too much tho. So if you wanted to know if am from a high-risk country then the answer is no.
@_date: 2016-04-01 11:28:58
I will keep this post updated every step, including the conclusion. My trading history with kraken was very good untill now, even if they give my money back i will still feel sorry if i have to stop our colaboration.
@_date: 2016-04-01 17:11:50
Defense ? I was thinking the opposite.
@_date: 2016-04-01 07:27:06
I'm sorry it happened to you too. I still can't believe they do this, i am sure they have just made a mistake or something, they **couldn't** possibly do this by intent. **Could they??**
@_date: 2016-04-01 06:21:37
I think you should move the reminder a little further. 
An acquaintance of mine whom i personally know has been under "investigation" since september 2015 and it still didnt end. He doesn't really care because he had 0.40 euros in balance when he got suspended, so he just moved to another exchange. I never thought this could happen to me.
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:55:41
I have added an update and a later edit for those who say that i might have connections with people with locked accounts or that is something about kyc/aml.
@_date: 2016-04-01 11:10:11
Well isn't thats what is bitcoin about ? Becoming the new paypal only with bigger restrictions ! Smaller limits ! Right ??
Oh wait i'm sorry it was made for oposite reason..... hmm then why it took this direction ??
@_date: 2016-04-01 16:54:41
I never had and never will work with someone who confirmed to me he has btc from illicit activities. I made that very clear with all my clients, but even so i have never been too nosy and ask them where they had them from or what they intended to do with them because at the end of the day even if it is 100% legal, if he found for example a place that sells very cheap things for bitcoins he wouldn't tell me, and forcing him to do so i consider to be a bad business aproach.
However i have clients(the ones with big volumes) that buy from their friends/people they know and they sell to me. So even if the btc had been blacklisted, it doesn't mean i did or my direct client did the criminal activity and suspending me for this is like aresting a person who received counterfeit currency as change from a supermarket. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 19:51:42
Yeah i am trying to be calm. I am not taking the agressive lead here. I never thought this topic would get so much attention (and hate).  I just wanted to hear some advices (and i did). Working with kraken was fantastic untill this came up. 
I trust they have the best intention, but i think they have much to work regarding their support and their customer service/client-relation. I may have been just a particular case, but in this business you don't shoot first and ask later. That is just not the way to handle these things imho. I will talk to a lawyer, but my main objective is not to sue/defame them, but to solve the problem and sort things out.
Kraken's main downside is that their support/team is not open with you. If they have a problem they will not try to sort it out with you. They are like a bad girlfriend : they see you doing something wrong, dont correct you and then one day just burst at you. And even after bursting, still not tell you what you did wrong.
I am kind of happy and sad that this thread got so much attention. I am happy that now there is a starting point for people in my case in the future, but sad because it turned from a helping post to a hating post really fast and that is not constructive.
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:40:26
I replied earlier but now that i enter here i see it hasn't been posted. I am an active and big (or thats what i like to think) trader in my country who has been using bitcoin and help developing a bitcoin comunity in my country since the early days hence i know a few hundred different people who use bitcoins in my country. By i know them i mean i have talked to them/seen them at least once. So its not like i work with 5 person from what 3 have locked account.
@_date: 2016-04-16 22:23:43
I said thanks. I will abstain from throwing dirt at kraken for doing their job, but it seems other users have talked my mind already.
@_date: 2016-04-01 09:57:20
I personally know another person whose account was suspended under similar context. They just sent a notice saying their account was put under investigation and that was the last reply from them. 
I don't want to defame them and/or instigate people against them. I'm just posting and keeping an update about my case exactly how it is happening. You decide if you want to keep your bitcoins there or not. 
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:23:02
What a coincidence. Right after i go to the public the things start to move faster. Anyway thanks for solving this in an almost decent amount of time. Could you tell when the abilty to trade and withdraw will be restored too ? Because at the momment i still can't.
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:33:32
The problem is i am from eu. I dont have anything dirty to hide and if i sue them i would do it to recover the money of course. I know that locking an asset that generates money without a legal basis makes the person who locked it responsible for the money not generated by the asset in the time it was locked. But i dont care about that right now.
@_date: 2016-04-01 16:42:45
Yes thats what i thought too, otherwise i would have been trading on btc-e. The problem is when you are not involved in the listed causes, but you still get suspended. If the bitcoin trading platforms turn into paypal then i will lose my faith in BTC. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 10:29:37
I know 8-9 persons who use kraken from what 3 have been in this situation and two of them didn't resolve it yet, so from my point of view its more than 1%.
@_date: 2016-04-01 07:42:07
Yeah, i'm just getting them near me to have them ready. I still abstained from throwing accusations on them of any kind. But depending on how things are evolving i might want these pitchforks on standby.
@_date: 2016-04-01 10:45:42
Im not even sure is possible to blacklist coins, and if it is then its the stupidest think ever because bitcoin can travel through multiple addresses and the final receiver doesn't have to be necesary the original owner. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 19:55:28
There were 40 cents in the balance. That is probably why he didn't agitate too much about this.
@_date: 2016-04-01 10:25:17
I only work by national bank transfer and at least in my country the law says that the banks are required to meet the kyc/aml standards. So by working through bank i automatically meet these standards.
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:02:42
Yes it did and right now i am happily working with kraken. I am not satisfied by how long and what it took to resolve, but what matters is that now is resolved and i am working with them again happily. I just hope i will never be put in a simmilar situation again.
