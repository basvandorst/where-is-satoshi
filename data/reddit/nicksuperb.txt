I am simultaneously confused and entertained. Thanks.

Just a guess but maybe the blockchain could somehow store virus definitions? But trust/verification aren't really problems to solve when it comes to this sort of information. 
I could see some merit to the idea of a decentralized virus database but do we need a blockchain to do that?

Like a DNS system for bitcoin addresses? Its been posited before. [Namecoin]( has somewhat similar ambitions, albeit not exactly the same as what you may be thinking.
In a perfect world I could imagine a decentralized address resolution system where "mining" could in fact be the act of resolution itself... and the blockchain could be realized as a 'namechain' of sorts where transactions could be the act of registering/transferring addresses.
Yeah, all that sounds like a security nightmare and frought with technical challenges. I'll start working on it right away.

I think this would be an interesting idea. If we could could create a "market" for transaction fees where the incentive could fluctuate dynamically it could make the mining process quite interesting. Keeping in mind the long term future of mining beyond the life of block rewards this could keep pumping new life into the mining process.
