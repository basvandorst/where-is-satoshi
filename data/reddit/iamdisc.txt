This is called tyranny of the majority, a huge flaw of democratic system. I really do not want it replicated here.

BitBay had to evacuate from Poland after polish socialist government launched hostile campaign against cryptocurrencies. Other exchanges either did the same, or closed their business.
Government intented to implement world most brutal tax policy on traders (effectively expropriating and imprisoning them), launched some YT campaigns bashing crypto and put exchanges on their warn-list. Also, prosecutor dragged BitBay CEO, Sylwester Suszek into the court.
Luckily, some other countries were interested in having BitBay on their soil (Switzerland, Malta, United Arab Emirates, among others). Malta's prime minister himself asked Sylwester to move BitBay to his country.
This is exactly, why we need cryptocurrencies.
