For 1) I think you have a misunderstanding, once Bob opens the payment channel with 0.05BTC on the main blockchain, that BTC is gone from Bob's control and is locked up in the multi-sign address... he can no longer spend that money on the main blockchain as he doesn't own it in his address anymore.
The only way for him to get back the money in the payment channel that he still owns (minus the transactions offchain where he spent some BTC) if for one of the channel owners to close the channel, then the BTC gets distributed back to the rightful owners addresses.

I don't really understand that... I totally get a company locking an account for suspicious activity and stuff that seems criminal, but if they have a daily withdraw limit of 10k a day and you withdraw 10k a day, I dont really see how that is a problem or anything to be cautious of.
I'd love to see the specific case you are referencing and the details of this.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:48:33
Oh yeah I think I remember reading that too... honestly, if a customer has withdrawn 50K, I have no problem with them requiring more verification and doing more checks... that is totally fine.
But completely locking out your account and funds that is another matter. Glad to read that they resolved this issue you posted about fairly quickly.

Totally this! Also the mentality of "putting my livelihood in this" has the stench of gambling. Nobody should be using bitcoin to gamble, especially with their future on the line.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:27:08
Gamble - "take risky action in the hope of a desired result"
If you don't understand that Bitcoin is a risk then you are fairly delusional or naive to the facts at best. Anyone going "all in" on Bitcoin is taking a huge risk, and if they have somehow convinced themselves this isn't the case, then they have been brainwashed.
Also just because you believe in something that doesn't change the facts or reduce the associated risks, it just means you are less likely to think rationally where it is concerned.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:14:55
You are beginning to sound a lot like all those bank manager and hedge funders who say that Bitcoin has no value.
All the same reasons why you levy at altcoins for having no value, could be said the same about Bitcoin... the only differences is you are trying to differentiate Bitcoin as different.
"Tell me why Fiat, Honda, Toyota are worth so much, when we have Ford?" - See how silly your argument sounds.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:31
Well if they (coinbase) put the limit of 10k daily, and then someone used that limit daily... I don't see how they can consider that structuring, maybe if they had a higher limit the guy would have used that... but since you said for some reason they wouldn't raise his limit.
My point, and main concern with this whole thing is, if a company puts arbitrary limits on accounts like that themselves, then punishes their users when they utilize these limits, that seems like a super shady business practice.
i.e. They really don't want their customers to have (easy) access to their own coins/money so they are hiding behind the guise of "security" to prevent people to access what is rightfully theirs.

@_date: 2017-12-29 16:10:39
I understand your sentiment but what you are saying isn't strictly true... There are many investments and financial items that DO have a guaranteed return and growth, for example some retirement and institutional funds, guarantee an X% growth every year. In that sense not ALL investments are gambling.
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:14:04
That's my point, you were implying it was proof they destroyed the keys in your original post, not proof that the coins didn't move.
You clarified now in this response but still made the same mistake of assuming that "most likely the key is destroyed"... It's a very dangerous argument to make this assumption since you have no proof it is true, i.e. it is only your opinion and nothing more.
Since the two facts are in no way connected, you can't use proof for one as reasoning for the other, that is a fallacy.
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:43:32
That's not how proof works, lol
"full proof" != "most likely"

I seem to remember them announcing that Bitcoin payments for their other sites would be coming after a few days (back when they first started accepting Bitcoin payments).

Why would they lock you out for withdrawing the limit each day?
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:18:57
Unfortunately not, everytime you make a transaction using bitcoin, that is essentially gains. Even trading BTC for other altcoins has tax considerations, so you need to consider this whenever you use your BTC that you have gained via one method or another.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:10:10


Did I just see what you did there.? or not
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:01:05
That is a bit of a misleading answer, in reality the 'end-time' of bitcoin mining is not really THAT far off, rough estimates put it at around 2032, when the supply reaches upwards of 99% and the reward for mining has halved enough times, the reward per block at that time will be around 0.78125000BTC each block... it is safe to assume at this stage that the game will have changed drastically... the following 100 years after that time wont really change much for bitcoin supply, as mining for the last &lt; 1% won't be a significant changer in the landscape.
I personally believe that once we have halved a further 2 times, this will be a major game changer and lots of interesting possibilities open up for bitcoin, since the time of continuous supply is effectively run out.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:57:51
You are confusing and mixing two separate things. Value of BTC vs fiat currency and amout of BTC entering the market via mining.
I am purely talking about the supply of BTC that is earned via mining. The value of BTC has no bearing on my original point.

Hey that's not  the point I was referring to!
My response was merely poking fun of your *"if the transaction completely bypasses the banking system who is going to report it?"* question and the absurdity of those that think just because no bank is involved the IRS isn't going to notice (or care).
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:51:34
Part of the problem with "legal tax avoidance" or minimizing the amount for tax you pay by legal loop holes, is that they are only available to the very wealthy...
Personally I would be all for everyone paying as little tax as legally possible, but the problem is, access to these methods and the expertise to carry them out isn't available to every single individual equally; that is what makes this practise so morally unfair and leaves a bad taste in most people's mouths.
When the system is advertised as "the wealth pay more tax, because they earn more" but in actuality it amounts to "the more money you earn, the less you can pay (as a %) because of legal loop holes", that is when I start to feel betrayed by the system and governments overseeing the tax laws.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:33:37
People are generally angry and disgusted with the governments anyway and for a number of different reasons. This doesn't mean that people can't also call out individuals and large scale abuse of these practices as well.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:35:43
LOL. this is an incredibly naive way to think and look at this. About as dumb as the other guy who thought that buying a house completely with BTC, he is immune to tax....

Also very fundamental is the concept of trust... or rather dis-trust (all the work with lightning networks and muti-person transfers). We take the opposite approach and assume that no one trusts each other, in fact we assume that each person is not only untrustworthy, but will act in their own self interest.
For example, Alice and Bob want to transact with each other but neither one trusts the other, how do they proceed. etc.

@_date: 2016-10-31 17:29:05
To be honest, you are kinda putting yourself in the line for this type of situation, if what you provide (online service) has no way to provide proof that the buyer has received or consumed the service, then you really shouldn't be expecting a payment service to just take your word for it... Or you shouldn't be offering payment on a platform that needs to have checks in place to protect both the buyer and the seller; like it sounds like in your situation, Paypal is just not a good fit for your business... it kinda sucks, but that is just the way it is. You should write off these chargebacks and fees as an additional expense to using paypal and calculate this in your budgets and financials... i.e 1-2% of all sales will result in chargebacks and might incur additional fees, etc.
hey I am by no means sticking up for paypal, I am just pointing out that with online services you should really have a system in place that can be used to prove and verify that customers receive and/or consume the service... or are you really expecting 100% of your buyers/customers to be completely honest and good citizens? In the ideal world nobody would try to scam anyone else or get anything for free, but you know as well as everyone else does, this is far from an ideal world and if there is a loop hole that allows people to get stuff for free, or take advantage of a system, then they will.
@_date: 2016-10-31 21:49:00
No unfortunately, this is something I don't have experience of and since I don't own a store to sell digital good I can't suggest anything.
What I can suggest however is to stop using Paypal if Paypal doesnt fully support digital goods or services, or if they don't provide seller protection for these kind of transactions, and that is what your business is based around.
Look I've said it before, I am not a big fan of Paypal and please don't think I am defending or championing for them... but this is a very clear case of a service being advertised for a certain purpose and then people complaining when it doesn't work for a completely different purpose. Out of all the things to get shitty about with Paypal, this isn't one of them.
The OP clearly knows that Paypal doesn't provide seller protection for the online services that they are selling, and by continuing to use Paypal as their payment provider they are quite open to being scammed, without any recourse, yet they continue to use Paypal and complain when people are able to scam them.
@_date: 2016-10-31 17:42:34
I am not talking about normal Paypal transaction fees. What I am saying is that if your business, and the way that you provide services, doesn't allow you to prove to Paypal that the buyer is scamming you, then you should either account for a % of scammers/chargebacks in your financials, or stop using a service like Paypal that doesn't fit your business model...
Paypal DOES have ways to stop buyers from scamming sellers and has protections in place, but as you have identified their methods don't match up with your business structure, so you have two options:
1) Accept that some scams will happen and account for this, or
2) Stop using Paypal.
I don't understand what the $20 paypal fee is though, like others have mentioned this is probably a new admin fee that Paypal charges when they are issued a successful chargeback, some people have mentioned that you can contact Paypal to find out more about this.

That's was kinda my point in my original post... minor tax evasion could kinda be overlooked and generally with all the confusion around online currencies and such could be fairly easy to get away with or minimize the risk... but this dude basically came to reddit and boasted about making $60k+ and using it to buy a house outright, and not wanting to pay any tax... I'm pretty sure that is the textbook definition of a fish in a barrel for IRS.

That would technically be classed as fraud, or tax evasion. If you don't declare your assets correctly or knowingly lie about them on your tax return then you are in for major punishments.

Hey man, not wanting to tell you how to live your life, be as free and easy as you want, not judging you here. Just know the risks and consequences of your actions... normally I wouldn't say it is too much of a risk with small profit gains, but when you start talking about huge sums of money, hiding $60k worth of gains... that's the sort of thing that tax authorities take note of. When the IRS comes knocking on your new brand new house you just bought asking for proof of where your funds came from, don't act so surprised...

Again "Talk to an expert" isn't really helpful or even technically an answer to the specific question I asked... it's basically a non-answer. YES I can talk to an expert but I was seeking the general advice and opinions of other users of this sub, whats the harm in that? It's really not that difficult to comprehend, if I want to talk to a paid, experienced expert in their field, I will; alternatively if I want to seek general opinions and thoughts from "internet strangers" that is also my choice.
I get it, an accountant or a tax expert is the best person to give advice and professional opinions about tax questions, wow, who would have thought that eh? I'm so glad you both enlightened me to that fact.
What's the point of anyone on here asking any question even related to tax or money if brainless tards like you and the other commenter just act like dumbless fucks and say "ask an accountant" and then act all sanctimonious when people call you out for the useless insight... fuck sake.
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:35:46
I'm actually interested what happens in the situation where a person genuinely doesn't know that they are making a mistake or spending additional money that doesn't belong to them??
I'm not talking about ridiculously obvious amounts of money, but i can feasibly see a scenarios where a few thousand $ might be accidentally spent by a person from their account based on a banking error, surely in those situations comment sense prevails and an amicable resolution is sought, rather than just pressing criminal charges on the individual.

Sorry if I came across as snappy, but when your response to someone asking a question on reddit is "ask an expert", can you see how this not really helpful. 
If everyone's response to anyone asking a question on the internet boiled down to "ask a tax expert, ask a doctor, see a lawyer, etc" it wouldn't be the amazing information sharing place that it is today.
Not everyone is looking for professional advice and that's exactly why places like reddit exist.

I wasn't asking specifically about filing out my taxes, I was asking for general advice  and opinions if you are allowed to choose to take a gain or a loss if both situations apply or if there are any rules that need to be followed.
Stop being an ass, you know you were unhelpful. If you want to see the sort of response that was perfectly accepted to my question, please look to the reply by you response was a waste of both your time and mine.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:45:56
Stellar advice there, thanks. If I had easy access to a tax expert do you not think I would have asked them, instead of coming to Reddit with a general question?!
Seriously though, I'm not looking for an in-depth run down of specific personal situation, just a general idea of if it is best to take a gain or a loss if you could take either, or if you **have** to take one or the other because of law.
