@_date: 2017-12-06 16:45:33
You've only been on Reddit for 2 days, so I'll give you some quick history
1) Bcash is an attempt to steal the Bitcoin brand. There are even some scammers who think that it should be called "Bitcoin" (maybe if some conditions are met, like if Jihan waves his scepter thrice at Bitpay HQ). Dissolving the Bitcoin from Bcash's name helps avoid confusion of which is actually Bitcoin, and which is an altcoin - especially important for newbs. [A top post]( from today documents how the trickery of bcash conmen can lure in even seasoned bitcoiners. 
2) Bcash is a project run by [scammers and conmen]( Ver calls it "his project", but really it's several other criminals involved. Again, we don't want people losing money to charlatans because they bought the wrong Bitcoin. They should know they're buying *not Bitcoin*, but bcash.
3) Bcash triggers the enemies of Bitcoin: [Jihan]( and [Roger]( Clearly, the name theft is important.
4) "bcash" is handy. "Bitcoin cash" is just clumsy. Try having a conversation about exchanges between Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash, and cash. Also, it sets a precedent for other knock-off coins (bdiamond, bgold, bplus, etc.) It also distinguishes the forked bcash from the original version of bcash, [Bitcoin Clashic](
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:28:13
I agree.
It's actually aggravating to see bcash get discussed on here so regularly considering how technically inferior bcash is to many other alts.
The focus of this sub is Bitcoin, which means we stay up to date with
- [awesome projects]( where alts and 
Bitcoin complement each other
- altcoins that attempt to scam Bitcoin users and noobs by imitating the Bitcoin brand
Just wish it were more of the former...

Segwit is more transactions and cheaper transactions with an identical user experience. Coinbase, blockchain.com, etc. haven't implemented it. I agree that there's a problem.
We're learning with Segwit. Some companies will not make improvements to their products until users are up in arms demanding it on social forums. Importantly, We should abandon products and companies for those that offer greater utility. (Bitstamp, to counter the exchanges listed above)
Lightning may be tough to implement, but it offers huge utility. For the user, Lightning is easy to use (even easier if an online service deals with channels under the hood.)
Whichever companies are willing to invest in massive scaling deserve the users it would benefit - which is to say: all of them.

Bitcoin itself is an escape hatch from an monetary system that most people are ok with, but that Bitcoiners find alarming. Bitcoiners, especially the early ones, are a skeptical, danger-averse crowd.
Bitcoin.com and the bcash crowd are truly malevolent actors against Bitcoin, but there are probably a few "false positive" dangers alerted here - where the alarm level and actual threat level do not line up.
For instance, Coinbase seems completely trustworthy for holding your money (short term, just to be safe) and exchanging one type for another. It has lately been acting poorly with regard to the Segwit2X fiasco, dragging their feet on Segwit - so it's deservedly scolded in public.
Bitstamp is another worthy exchange that works with accounts in Sweden.

Some will say that "yeah, right, and go to jail..", but that's nonsense. You will get a letter saying that the IRS believes your statement was incorrect. You have 30 days to pay the balance, or reply (with a revised return, for example). They have 90 to reply (they'll take longer). And back and forth.
*If* all that happens. They will spend 10s of thousands of dollars to get your chump change returns, and charge your the 3% interest on back taxes (hm, think BTC will do better than that for you?)

Bitcoin has good developers, community, and infrastructure.
B2X sucks - which is fine for any alt - but this one is also an attack on Bitcoin.
That's why I personally am anti-B2X.
How does it suck? I'll provide some off-the-cuff comments and some links..
Bitcoin has a proven software development model with a good team of developers. They have continuously and safely made progress in a way that deserved by world-changing tech project: hundreds of developers across many companies, regular merged changes, lots of public discussions, all technology freely released to the public, etc.
B2X (btc1 on github) is hurried along by a single developer, and isn't even keeping up with Core's updates. The real Bitcoin team wants nothing to do with it, but they have helped at least find B2X bugs to safeguard users. The proponents of B2X are not generally techies hoping for widely-available transactions, but companies with histories of patenting technology that allows them to cheat the system, mining empty blocks, promoting altcoins, and so on.
From a technical standpoint, the main problem with B2X is that the need to scale with a block size increase is not even fully understood (It would be better understood if miners signalled Segwit a year ago instead of when UASF put a fire at their feet. It would also be better understood if companies like Bitpay would use Segwit and stop feeding its users lies about upgrade paths.) Preventing centralization of nodes is crucial to Bitcoin retaining any fundamental value, and bigger blocks necessarily increase centralization. Bigger blocks are sure to be necessary, in my opinion, but the impact on scaling should be considered when Segwit and Layer 2 has come into fruition. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:54:46
Yeah. Fees go down with Segwit. Then they're basically free with Layer 2 (Lightning, Sidechains, etc.) - which Segwit enables.
Good idea OP bailing on bcash - I think it will only get worse once people realize what never having Segwit means for that coin's upgrade path.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:21:47
Sorry. It's been talked to death so I didn't think to elaborate.
The easy fix is a block size increase.
To understand what's wrong with that would require much more study than watching a half hour video.
In a nutshell, a small change in complex, interdependent systems (such as Bitcoin's distributed consensus network) can have major ramifications. With larger blocks, the most apparent side-effect is increases node centralization - which is antithetical to Bitcoin's value proposition.
A real world example: For months, Segwit2X proponents pushed for just changing block size from "1 to 2". That code change was made and the 2X implementation of Bitcoin entered its "quiet mode" in August, because that simple block size change was in and nothing more should be risked. 
Segwit2X fell flat on its face, not mining a single block. No network-based attack. No hack of the software. "One simple change" and it couldn't even get to its feet in Bitcoin's playground.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:40:00
Seeing it, too. Someone in rbitcoinbeginners shilling it yesterday, regarding the "technical merit".
I responded that the only technical merit I see is -
 if you're a miner - asicboost.

I agree about having a well-designed and adaptive block size limit, just so the devs and community don't have to fiddle with it for a while. If you've got a solid idea worked out, maybe start discussing with devs on the mailing lists.
I don't think you give Layer 2 solutions enough credit, though. Seem to me like the best approach to getting massive scaling while maintaining decentralization.
If your concern about them takes a form like "But how would they..." I suggest you go digging for answers. Expect to be pleasantly surprised.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:05:04
m₿ is a good base unit today. I agree with that much. Seems right to pay 1 coin for a sandwich, half a coin for a drink, etc. 
I don't expect that we'll really be thinking in smaller divisions of a bitcoin until it's as much a currency as it is a speculative investment. That means prevalent layer 2 scaling and much less volatility. Layer 2 is the big factor because then fees would be a non-issue when spending day-to-day - as a currency rather than investment (i.e., ~0% of the base unit will be spent on fees - just like handing over physical fiat.)
By that time we're there, .000001 may be a more reasonable base unit and it will get a name organically.

Money from a segwit address gets the segwit discount. Even if it is sent along with money from a non-segwit address as part of the same transaction.
[Detail here](
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:56:02
Many of us here were expecting to hunker down for a few days during the S2X fork. I think we're just getting that chaos a few days early since it's a ripe market for bcash to attack.
Focusing on momentary spikes in fees, price swings, etc. is losing the big picture. Bitcoin has shown incredible strength with its social infrastructure, withstanding a considerable takeover attempt.
People exiting Bitcoin for alts in light of the cancelled dividends would naturally move into strong alts. I think that's what we saw in the first 24 hours after S2X dying. Bitcoin down, alts up (except for shitty ol' bcash, because who would exit real Bitcoin for the Chinese knock-off).
However, another well-funded pump of a bcash has turned the other cryptos upside-down, too. Stirring up more chaos on the tail-end of S2X uncertainty to increase panicked investment decisions.  Pumping the price to make it appear like a refuge and encouraging others to pile in.
I wouldn't put it past the mining cartel, who benefit the most from bcash, to be unleashing another wave of spam transactions at the same time. [They've done it before](
Smart traders are going to make lots of money at this, once they've done so I expect alts will pick up again. Bcash will once again buckle under the pressure of being useless. And Bitcoin will continue its regular ascent.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:04:11
There are some small increases we get with Segwit, Schnorr. Maybe like 2x transaction throughput..
The real action is sidechains, [lightning]( and other higher layer solutions. These retain the secure and decentralized qualities of Bitcoin (unlike the cheap, Chinese knockoff) while also allowing thousands of transactions per second (unlike the cheap, Chinese knockoff, whose dismissal of segwit has blocked off these types of upgrades)
I was very subtle, but I also hinted an answer to your question in the comments about "which coin to buy" :)

Bitcoin is decentralized and widely distributed. If and when a new altcoin comes anywhere near Bitcoin's level in these dimensions then your argument has some merit.
Instant, free transactions on top of Bitcoin is the best way I can see to achieve those things. Sidechains are extremely good, too.

Unfortunately, the first step (Segwit) got in the way of a miner's cheat trick called *Asicboost*. Miners delayed Segwit as long as possible - only allowing it to activate while they simultaneously launched an Asicboost-friendly shitcoin (bitcoin cash).
So the answer to "what are Core devs doing" is **their plan**. We're just about a year behind schedule thanks to a disruption by miners.

The Block size "argument" has long-appeared to be a bait and switch for a power grab by scammers and charlatans. So I agree that it would drop the price as it would be harder to maintain the  farce, but the pump would continue since the political reward would still exist.
Hard to set dates for tech development - probably best to release stuff "when it's ready". I would also appreciate seeing more prominent devs take their best guess at when notable events will occur (lightning network in common use, block size increase, etc.)
Actually, I know quite a few have gone on record. Is anyone keeping  active documentation on these dates?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:45:28


I think it's still too much hassle and too risky for many people. It's a lot of responsibility to sign up for a separate service in a new ecosystem and then take on new risks to "be your own bank".

To clarify, Segwit use by big bitcoin companies, such as exchanges, would alleviate the transaction congestion simply because they do a lot of transactions. More Segwit txns can be packed in each block.
It's unfortunate that they aren't feeling the brunt of fees because they have opted to mostly just pass it on to users. That's especially irritating since many of the companies complaining about network congestion, and promoting shady altcoins as a "solution" (bitpay, blockchain.info, coinbase), don't seem in much of a hurry to implement Segwit.
I don't know about which exchanges are using Segwit - look for deposit addresses starting with '3'.

I agree. The way things are, you get devs regularly entering a drama in the late stages just to put out fires and try to correct misinformation.
I'd appreciate some clearly-presented and regularly maintained site that outlines all the ongoing technical developments, who is working on them, how much support they have from the devs at large, and when they are expected to drop. 
Similarly, where the devs stand on the ongoing drama (there was some of this in the [Bitcoin wiki for the S2X fiasco]( - even though that was helpful it is also demonstrates why PR should not be the duty of the devs)
Basically, every interested member of the community has to sift through videos, articles, blog posts, and social media crap just to form a picture of where things are going. That means everyone could have a very different picture in their heads; And that's not a good foundation for discourse. While it's good to form your own opinion, it's better to base that opinion on indisputable facts, clearly presented.
Good idea

hitBTC doesn't have a b1X futures, so it's not really competing the B2X against Bitcoin. in other words, $2k price is nonsense. (coincidence that coinmarketcap lists B2X futures from hitBTC and also BCH scam site as an official Bitcoin site?)

The other sub is not currently occupied by an army of shills posting a new FUD message every few minutes.

While there may be catalysts leading to spikes, I tend to think the gross movement will be steady increases of **saturation**.
There may be a strict metric for when that occurs, but for me it is when I can ask some rando on the street if they have bitcoin and increasingly expect the answer to be 'yes'. 
Facebook, for instance, has reached full saturation.
To map that onto your question, it would be big jumps in ownership - like if a government credits every citizen with 1000 satoshis as some experimental welfare.

Blockstream is definitely one of the important parts of the Core development team. It has [about 30 investors listed here.]( Tech investors (like Reid Hoffman), silicon valley VCs, banks, fintech speculators, etc. 
Not sure how much intrigue you hope to find there. I mean, it's not like a Chinese miner cartel is footing the bill or anything.
I think it's more important to review who founded it, and understand that they did so in order to have an enclave where they could build out Bitcoin with autonomy. That's why they have defensive patents, where necessary, and otherwise build tech without patent (as in the case of Segwit).
An [article posted today]( goes further into the teams behind the projects.

Nope. There's a lot of anti-Core rhetoric on this sub, sometimes presenting a worthwhile perspective but most is just cheap vitriol.

Currently, pumping bcash/BCH seems to be the objective of most shill accounts. Pretty interesting to watch as a kind of meta-narrative to the price action and software development.

Bcash is inferior to Bitcoin (as well as most altcoins I've spent time looking into). The reason it's on your mind at all is because it's being pumped as part of an attack against Bitcoin.
To understand why Bcash exists and is supported requires a fair amount of reading. It came up in some threads yesterday. Examples:
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:48:26
We all like low fees, but most of us here understand that the [quick and easy fix]( destroys Bitcoin's chief value proposition. The bcash shill army hoped to overwhelm this insight by coupling spam attacks with fee FUD.
I read the OP's intent as mostly drawing attention to the end of the that particular campaign. 
Now that fees have dropped in Bitcoin, you won't even save a few bucks by using a Chinese knockoff. So the tactic has instead shifted to [*Bcash is totally legit!*](
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:31:17
Alright. Hope it all goes well for you.
Plenty of alts are cooler than bcash, though. Might want to also have a look at those if you're looking to diversify.
[Coingecko]( is pretty nice for quickly learning about a lot of different coins, across several factors beside price - so you can invest on fundamentals.

It's all pretty complicated. Start here
It's good money in a number of ways (stores value, easy to transport, easy to identify, hard to counterfeit, doesn't inflate, etc.), but it's not great for day-to-day purchases because it is inefficient to store all those billions of daily transactions on an unchangeable record multiplied across thousands of computers for all time.
However, there are ways to get those features, too. See 'lightning' and 'sidechains'

My thoughts exactly.
There are several solutions near release or already released, and some of these will increase transaction throughput and drop fee cost *massively*.
The problem with the fee discussion is when it veers toward quick fixes that break Bitcoin's chief value proposition as decentralized money.

What, in particular?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:15:30
I think there are a few altcoins out there with merit, but rbitcoin isn't for altcoin discussion.  That being said, when this particular alt comes up I think it deserves the open disdain it receives.
BCH is a crappier version of Bitcoin that tries to hijack Bitcoin's social infrastructure (and sometimes its name, though Jihan is thankfully abandoning that tactic).
This moment is the tail-end of S2X chaos, so they're is striking while the iron is hot. So it's yet again being pumped by the scammers and con artists that birthed it, and yet again we are all calling it a turd.

Lightning network is running now. It has very little infrastructure - sort of like the internet when it was still between just a few colleges

@_date: 2017-11-18 23:52:24
Segwit transactions are regular, but still only [about 10%]( of the total. [Several wallets support it]( - not enough wallets or businesses yet, but just because they're dragging their feet.
Lightning had its first successful transaction [back in July]( but most development activity is happening on testnet. Best guesses I heard are for prime time Lightning in mid to late 2018.
It won't be turning a switch for deployment across the whole network. It's individual lightning projects releasing on the mainnet and then adoption by business and users.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:59:33
I think he's saying that signalling a soon-to-be supported fork causes the market to expect a price rise.
The market expects the price rise because there have been several forks where the combined market cap of both coins post-fork is higher than the coin pre-fork (or even, the original coin becomes worth more after it is forked from).
The market expecting a price rise leads to more buying -&gt; higher coin price.
Now the miners are mining more valuable coins. *That's* where the profit is.
Whether the fork is supported post-fork doesn't affect today's profit opportunity.

This is so often misrepresented in media outlets. People must be widely informed that B2X is NOT FROM THE PEOPLE THAT MADE BITCOIN. &lt;--- 'Developer' is the word, but I think mainstream might not get the gravity of that.
I liken it to you wanting to upgrade your 2010 Camero, and at the dealer you find the 2010 Camero with an extra seat bolted to the hood. A hack job performed not by Chevy but by a lone mechanic in his garage.

The biggest difference between Bitcoin and its knockoff is that bcash accommodates Asicboost.
Bcash lacks a major enabling technology, which also reduces fees (Segwit) because it gets in the way of asicboost.

As you've expressed numerous times, you see the NYA as what got us segwit. (I'm uncertain about the degree UASF alone would have been successful - or messy - but that's all theoretical anyway.)
I've had a nagging suspicion that you were doing whatever necessary to get through the segwit blockade - trusting the market and the ecosystem to right itself through the phase that followed. Once segwit arrived, to allow this course correction, you had to publicly play the part of "loyal NYA'er".  To do otherwise would tarnish your own reputation and the reduce the likelihood of further agreement and diplomacy in Bitcoin.
If you haven't lost your principles, then sorry about all the abuse aimed your way. I, like a lot of people, am grateful for how you've helped bring Bitcoin to where it is.

@_date: 2017-11-08 21:47:41
Some have noted an [uptick in bcash shilling](
My assessment was that the bcash contingent was largely [supportive of B2X]( because it sewed chaos in real Bitcoin, which might make their own altcoin more appealing by comparison.
With B2X cleared away, they could resort to disruption by old reliable Fee FUD. Easy to manipulate when you pay fees to yourself.
That being said, I think the current backlog is mostly organic due to the reshuffling of money in light of B2X demise.
