Deloogay, innit.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:16:18
It is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:31:34


@_date: 2018-01-27 16:23:55
Not for a business account though. There was a complaint on here about this already this week.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:21:28
What are you on about?
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:32:33
That's not Banksy.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:20:44
What was deleted?
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:07:15
Where are all of the US $ stored? One for each USDT.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:32:40
Same here...
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:43:26
Is that camera operator drunk?
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:11:11
Did you have the Nano and details stored together...?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:25:06
Yes, yes. It's the moon. What can we do to stop the moon?
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:18:22
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:22:47
Shite: :(
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:20:34
Coinbase is for getting started and GDAX for when you're more comfortable with trading. Same company. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:54:31
Bcash is down 30% on the 24 hour chart.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:31:23
I thought about this too. I have a debit card already that can convert my balance to BTC and back again when spending (€).
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:17:29
Did you know you can spend fractions of a Dollar too...? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:05:23


Oh no it isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:04:15
Sell books.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:48:54
I've seen close to €1000 difference between GDAX and Bitstamp. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:03:25
They were worth next to nothing at the time (the laptop died in 2010) and he wasn't bothered about losing them. The HD wasn't dumped until 2013.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:51:30
In this case, it was.
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:33:40
It has been like that for a long time. I downloaded it in May and had both wallets enabled by default.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:39:40
Yep. Was considering this just for the month to month spending.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:46:03
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:51:43
He mentioned it on Twitter - no control over advert content.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:18:06
If he had it would be patented and limited to Apple users.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:31:55
That's not when the white paper was published though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:26:38
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:49:46
I agree it is extreme, but this wasn't cherry-picked to support his case. It happened right there on his live stream with some random viewer taking the BTC from his wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:44:14
$200 is nothing. Look at the percentages.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:28:27
Reward (12.5) + fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:02:43
...and twitter saves as jpeg.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:03:33
Yep, but he didn't know that. Obviously..
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:12:48
Jpeg artifacts could be introduced at any point. They can be seen around the text too. Proves nothing one way or the other.
@_date: 2018-05-10 07:52:38
It would be hilarious if somebody ID'd him on this.
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:19:26
Zoom in. Enhance.
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:52:54
WTF. Who granted that!?
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:36:42
Bitcoin Cash is a legitimate coin and name. Nobody could argue with that.
@_date: 2018-05-21 08:02:11
Nah, obviously shouldn't do that. Report it to devs or app store.
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:36:08
Bitcoin.com is aggressively campaigning to destroy Bitcoin (BTC) and replace it with their own coin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:41:22
What are Bing Bans?
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:31:54
Looks the same as GDAX.
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:18:57
Ah, it's fake anyway.
@_date: 2018-05-20 15:29:20
How does that compare to just buying the coins?
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:30:52
Can't you just copy these, or are they too small? :p
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:57:40
What are the others?
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:12:52
It was called BCC initially until it was discovered that Bitconnect got there first.
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:48:31
Could be 4000. The Play download counter is tiered and the next tier is 5000.
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:35:38
Psst. They're not real bankers.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:39:26
It has been doing that since December.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:43:01
It uses the camera to scan QR codes.
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:35:32
Fuck em. They're just shaking your tree.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:48:41
I have 1 of 2. Make me an offer.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:13:26
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:01:56
Need bigger blocks.
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:02:35
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:23:29
Beta was better quality overall but VHS was cheaper. People didn't care about the details, price dictated the winner.
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:43:13
I don't think he's cheap.
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:34:58
It's on almost every news outlet. Which one do you want?
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:01:34
Stop watching.
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:20:59
Aren't we all.
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:23:18
What does this mean? "Estimated BTC Transacted - 0.1 BTC"
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:05:04
$1m dick pic.
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:36:14
Capped supply (21m)...?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:26:56
We'll be dead before all coins are mined.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:20:24
I suspect this could be the issue, and the 25k might be slowly making its way back to where it came from.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:48:58
Yep. "Zoom out". :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:33:17
What exchange? I have a GDAX alert set for €5500 to buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:16:48
Ha! Seriously?
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:06:50
GDAX is owned by Coinbase, and there for when you have a bit more experience and are ready to move on from CB and its fees.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:18:39
Not mine, sorry. :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:45:44
I usually set the buy limit price a bit lower than the current price, and adjust the amount until it matches what I want to spend. Then sit back and wait for it to drop and trigger the buy. 
For example; 0.0787 BTC @ €6,950 is €546.97 - 
You could set the price lower than this but you'll have to wait for it to hit, and that could take days or never at all...
If you want to buy straight away, just set the limit price very close to the current price.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:32:17
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:12:55
Don't be so dramatic. Coinbase are signing up as many as 100k new accounts per day and complaints come from a minute percentage of those. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:32:26
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:19:10


That's not what you said though.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:34:20
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:26:22
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:47:29
It is going up when you watch it, but big chunks are being taken out too so overall it's dropping fast.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:20:07
Yeah, I do. I also know that we don't use $ in Europe. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:16:39
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:09:03
...TEN, no ELEVEN..
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:20:42
Bookmarked. Thanks. LOL
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:25:53
News comment sections are where the fucktards reveal themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:10:13
Took me an hour of repeated attempts to get my BTC out, which probably doesn't help the situation. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:09:24
It doesn't work that way. It was deliberately designed to slow down or become more difficult. This isn't a side-effect that can be overcome.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:47:02
If it's a pyramid scheme, who's at the top?
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:45:03
It won't be 21 million for a long time. There are also millions of lost or dead coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:36:12
It's the same thing. Just enter the BTC amount and the £ cost is filled automatically. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:33:07
Kraken is fucked.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:01:00
In Europe, maybe.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:32:30
Nah, it's dropping. I was 6k more a few minutes ago.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:22:18
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:06:36
Why do you want to do that?
Switch to GDAX, transfer your balance over, and set limit orders with no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:30:03
Ha! $50? Do you know what SEPA means?
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:16:32
Coinbase is only an exchange. You might be confusing it with Cryptocurrency itself.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:58:59
How many working days ago?
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:45:52
I find it hilarious that Jones had no time for Ver's conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:54:45
Somebody tripped on the cable and pulled it out.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:09:05
You can see the numbers..
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:38:24
You can top up in their app from a debit/credit card.
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:09:30
Fewer "coins", but more decimal places.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:54:00
Yeah, have to admit I couldn't listen to all of it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:09:05
You can see the numbers..
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:04:19
I'm surrounded by people that don't know what Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:33:24
Preferences &gt; Display options &gt; allow subreddits to show me custom themes
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:38:12
As long as people are arguing with Ver, adoption will slow down. Nobody wants to get into something that looks like two separate factions fighting over semantics. 
If you can't spot that there may be a difference between two things that appear to be similar but one costs 6X more, nobody can help you.
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:29:43
I think what he is doing is very shady and underhanded, and I don't know why he didn't market it as a separate entity "New and improved Bitcoin" or whatever, but I find it hard to believe that people are 1. falling for it and 2. losing out significantly as a a result...
Maybe if it could be argued that BTC's value dropped as a result of his campaigning, the holders of those 17m coins could take a case against him. :)
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:58:15
That doesn't look shady at all.
@_date: 2018-04-30 19:54:41
I really don't know, but attempting to sue him and failing (it will fail) will really give him something to bleat about.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:52:32
Did you look at the average transaction values too?
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:31:04
...since 2015?
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:22:24
So they've invented a way of making money very quickly but need investment to help sell it?
OK..
