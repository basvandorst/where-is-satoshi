Yeah.. I bought some awhile back.... damn it was SO difficult to get the wallet working... then it took days to get the coins back to an exchange.... Lots of bugs.

non-stop raping of grandmothers is terrible......

I think you know a fucking lot.....
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:28:54
Soon.... it will all happen in the next few months when the dust settles. Right now its only 3 monthly's. Soon after all the bitches of gloom and doom are silenced there will be weekly's, daily's, LEAPS.... you name it.... maybe even hourly's..... who knows.... It will take months more for brokerages that the masses can use to trade it though.

Nice Car !!!!   Enjoy !!
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:24:18
LMFAO... so tru.... they were all probably smoking dope and saying how the man is going to take over BTC with futures, ruin it, etc... so better sell......lol

If you use Coinbase's GDAX platform, there is NO Charge, No Fees to send BTC to any BTC address. I use this quite often.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:21:51
Nice !!  Don't pet the dogs...
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:28:29
hear, hear !!
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:08:39
So tru.... A friend of mine who hated BTC, and I mean hated the idea, asked me how he could buy a coin the other day.... lol..... no kidding..... he used to troll people who bought at $17,000.00
@_date: 2018-05-06 03:45:00
As I have predicted, 99.98% of the population will always and forever use Visa/Mastercard for their daily transactions. The credit cards offer Consumer protections, Cash back/frequent flyer miles, and most importantly the ability to buy $1,000's of dollars worth of things with no money. BTC will dominate as Gold 2.0  /  Store of value, all other alts will wither away.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:20:15
If we all just bought 1 BTC......WOW..... the price..... the price !!!!!
@_date: 2018-05-27 03:48:38
In 2001 I used to pay $3 for a sheet of 4x8 plywood.... It's over $27.00 today...... We are constantly being told by the government that there is no inflation. BTC for the anti-inflationary WIN !!
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:43:43
Can you condense this down to the average millennial attention span of 15 seconds?
Wut was I saying?
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:23:14
When BTC is $100,000 US Peso's at the end of this year, you will be crying tears of joy !!
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:20:51
There really needs to be a Roger 'dead baby' Ver meter. Kinda like the Bitcoin rollercoaster guy.
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:29:25
I think the cart is made by Lambo.
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:50:03
Are any babies being harmed during these interviews?
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:05:35
This Dick MUST be preserved !!!!
BUY BTC !!
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:12:21
We need a Roger 'Dead Baby' Ver Meter NOW !!!!!
It's the only way to keep track of how many babies are being killed by BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:44:00
Those pizzas were worth EVERY BTC. Look at all the free advertising BTC will receive forever.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:21:49
The last BTC will be mined !!!!!!
It's inevitable, just like the sunrise or the tide coming in !!
@_date: 2018-08-05 22:11:42
Somebody quickly bling out the squirrel. Give him a big gold chain, a nice custom diamond grill and a Lambo in the background.
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:31:32
Roger will not be happy
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:51:37
If BTC was an equity, I would say that BTC has hit a floor, but BTC is not an equity, so I am not sure.
It sure seems like it though.
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:53:16
Sad, but true. 
99.98% of the population will Always and Forever use Visa/Mastercard/Amex for their daily transactions. The credit cards offer Ease of use, but more importantly the cards offer Consumer protections(charge backs), Cash back/Frequent flyer miles/many other types of Rewards, and most importantly the ability to buy $1,000's of dollars worth of things with no money, just credit. 
BTC will dominate as Gold 2.0 / Store Of Value, all other alts will wither away. I do not care what BTC was originally designed for, often times products that were designed for one purpose end up being used for another purpose, very successfully I might add.
BTC for the SOV WIN !!!
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:48:27
LMFAO...... That's GREAT...... LUV IT !!!!!   
You the Man !!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:36:47

Don't forget that MacCoin also offers all the free napkins you want, and clean-ish bathrooms for midnight MacCoin exchanges.
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:43:01
Not only is the Big Mac coin more stable than the US Peso, but its also Anti-Inflationary!!!!
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:08:42
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:07:20
LMFAO !!!!!!
Even better than the original !!!
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:58:03
Thanks for the clarification, but wtf is a Robbie Williams?
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:52:34
Crystal Clear !!
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:44:39
No,,,, the Big Mac requires mass amounts of resources and man hours in order to produce it. It is probably one of the best anti-inflationary Coins out there.

Use to be the 5th wealthiest per capita in the world in the 50's.
Socialism has worked wonders there.
