Technically if you read the original documentation released by the creator of bitcoin ( Satoshi ), you will find that anyone who controls more than half of the computing power can freely manipulate the Crypto Currency including changing the ledger / previous transactions ( although they have incentive not to do this, since they can literally print money at that stage ). 
Although there are likely too many ASIC's dedicated to mining for a supercomputer to overpower, its entirely feasible for a government to make an ASIC with a breakthrough technology like graphene to completely overpower the market. 
And if a Government wanted to target a newer crypto currency with less computing power behind it, obviously it would be significantly easier to manipulate.
