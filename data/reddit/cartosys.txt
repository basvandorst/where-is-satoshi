While I agree, in the end it's all fun and games until price skyrockets. Things get a little more serious when 70,000 dogecoins are worth 70,000 dollars.  A poker bet for 50 cents is fun, but one for $50k is harrowing, and the mood gets TENSE quick!

I find that anywhere things get way more serious the more vested people are.

Location data could provide a selected default location making the venue selection more streamlined.

Now if they'll just give me an option to limit outgoing bitcoins to a single wallet address, all will be good on my end.

Wow.   A lot happens in 6 months.

Unless you've got a soft spot for Libertarian idealism, I don't see you using Bitcoin barring the collapse of the Dollar, but that's just worst-case-scenario thinking.  The only other use at this point besides investing (and somebody correct me if I'm wrong) would be frequently making purchases or paying for services online to foreign websites--although i've used Paypal to pay for  service done by an Indian business, so conventional monetary systems seem to be on top of that--so I don't see a huge incentive for the masses to start utilizing bitcoins any time soon.

Dear GOX.  Thanks for pioneering in an area where few dared and taken on risks involving countless unknowns to provide a new, bold and controversial service rife with unknown future ramifications for your creators.

I've been waiting on Dwolla to clear a deposit (already a day past their estimated clearing period), and have seen others complain about that as well.  This has prevented me from trading on Mt Gox pretty much since the U.S. news article on June 3, so i'm wondering if a flood of new money is about to enter, once those deposits clear...

Thanks for the link, but it seems to not be functioning (no email 10 minutes after clicking it--checked spam)

But would they care if they did?  Most people need a strong incentive to adopt Bitcoin since conventional currency works just fine for them.
