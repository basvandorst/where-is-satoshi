Sounds like a big distraction to me as well:
* Maintenance of your "mining" farm.
* Risk of running in the red with your mining operation.
* Distraction from fundraising/other activities.

That's no fun. Luckily life is not all about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:04:23
They have a huge amount of data that suggests otherwise.

Doesn't matter. Every transaction needs to end up on the blockchain. There are two immediate issues with handing out paper wallets:
1) The paper wallet contains the private key. If you do not have access to the blockchain you have no guarantee that the coins have not been spend. The receiver of the paper wallet must trust you that you did nobody ever copied the private key. 
2) You have no mechanism to handle change.
Both 1+2 are addressed by traditional currency.

A very painful read.. But you are likely correct about the information being sold, even worse is that there is no guarantee that giving 0.25BTC will actually result in removal of your info. 
Could you elaborate on why getting the FBI involved will cause more damage?

Yes, I would hold off until there is a trend reversal. Nobody here has any idea how low we can go.

Yes that is possible. See

How about millionaires go wherever they are treated nicest. The type of currency doesn't matter that much.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:25:45
Great, is there a way we can show statistics that adoption has not slowed down in country hostile towards BTC? Good example would be Russia, and potentially China. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:25:13
Well, just on bitcoinbuilder.com alone a whopping 4890 BTCE where available for trade... So at least 2,4 million dollars are gone! No biggie though, this money will be made back at the end of the year when BTC will be at a new ath.
@_date: 2014-02-19 08:11:42
Exactly! A decentralized crypto currency doesn't need a board! 
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:30:32
This analogy doesn't hold at all. Bitcoin will take away the ability for a government to print their own money. A problem far worse for a government then being able to control the delivery of mail. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:48:57
Value of bitcoins is only important to speculators and those early adopters that want to get rich quick.
We need regulation that leads to fast adoption, the rest doesn't matter.
@_date: 2014-04-03 08:00:12
That's why you prevent the en masse shift from happening, which is fairly easy.

Yeah! That will restore faith in bitcoin immediately!

Not yet, it is barely breathing but people are still actively trading and bitcoinbuilder.com still allows you to trade out coins..
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:43:53
The big mistake that is being made is that people are not using BTC as a currency, but as an investment vehicle. The majority of folks see BTC as an investment and the only thing they do is HODL.  
Instead of doing this, why not just use it for day to day transactions? Who cares what the price of a coin is? Buy at the beginning of the week, spend your coins and replenish when you need to.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:33:22
The only acceptable proof should include a demonstration of movements of coins that can only belong to Satoshi.

I would make a stronger statement, anyone without access to the blockchain will not be able to participate in a cashless society.

Maybe there is so little left that giving the customers what is left still results in angry customers going after them with guns and lawsuits...
Given that they have not opted for giving back what is left to begin with, it would be a dramatic reversal of course.

Glad I didn't buy at $9, as $6 is a lot cheaper than $9.

It looks like the name of the game is to destroy trading volume. Sure you can trade btc and it is not illegal, it is just very, very, very hard to do. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:31:54
This indeed seems to be the case. The scenario where bitcoin excels is semi anonymously paying for virtual goods. Most of the time I don't really care where my virtual goods come from. Good examples would be:
* Paying for a VPN. The ability to pay with BTC would give me another layer of security.
* A service like Netflix. I could finally sign up from Europe.
* A DNS service..
etc.. etc..
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:22:45
The generosity in this subreddit is overwhelming sometimes.  I'm so glad this community gets together to make btc a success. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:31:01
Yep, this is a bad idea. If you need btc on your phone I would switch away from Apple.

Here you can find out about the fees: 
The fees apply to non wells fargo banks..
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:07:36
I wonder about this as well. If you look at the  [estimate transaction volume]( chart you see that there is an actual decline in the amount of USD that goes around.
If you assume that there is not a huge amount of difference in the day to day exchange of funds for purchases (as measured in $) you would see something like this:
* An increase in the amounts of USD going around independent of BTC exchange rate as adoption increases.  
* Less volatility in the amount of USD transaction volume as a smaller percentage of the amount of BTC exchanged is used for speculation.
It doesn't appear that any of this is happening.

When I was a kid I was on holiday in former Yugoslavia. Back then the currency was deflating very rapidly. My dad used to give us a daily allowance. Well, in the beginning of the week you could buy an ice cream you could no longer afford at the end of the week.
Needless to say, we enjoyed our daily ice cream and gave up on saving fast :-)

Wasn't BTCChina pretty big a few months ago?
@_date: 2014-04-11 21:57:11
Wow, $4.48M gets you 40% stake in this company, so they believe they are worth around $12M...
How many miners are they selling and what is the markup on every miner?
@_date: 2014-02-22 06:09:08
Well, the simple fact is that someone will either donate you money or donate you a mining rig. Based on this  it is clear that you are better of taking their donation in cash (or btc). 
Unfortunately blockchain.info has removed the chart that shows that if you total up the cost of mining per day vs. the amount of money generated that the whole btc eco system is heavily running in the red right now. Meaning that more people spend $ on running their hardware compared to what they earn in BTC. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:44:41
The amount of USD I will have to translate to BTC yo buy something on their site doesn't change with the price of BTC.

You are making assumptions about their architecture which are not necessarily based on reality.

I love it! Thus allows us to see how much adoption they are getting, and will also give us some insight in how much they make!
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:40:04
To reduce this damage, it appears to put out a plea to high profile members of the bitcoin community to inject funds in the order of 200,000 BTC into the exchange, saying “the costs of not doing so are incalculable at this stage.”
Okay guys, let's pass the hat around!

Did you do a technical interview for a software engineering position? If so, how would asses the intellectual prowess of their development team?
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:06:19
This is great news! It would be great to get feedback of the non nerds in the street. Do they understand what's going on? What's hard? What's easy?
This might help us learn and identify key opportunities for new BTC services that facilitate adoption.
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:57:27
Yes! We are going mainstream!!

Well, obviously your time window in which you replenish bitcoins should be smaller than the expected swings of the currency value. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:56:57
This is way cooler and gets you karma points.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:22:55
In a way it is. Consider the following:
* Bitcoin aims to be a currency. 
* There are a limited number of bitcoins in existence, there will be a point where no new bitcoins will be made.
* As more people start to accept bitcoins the value will increase.
* There are several ways to acquire bitcoins:
  1) You mine them yourself. (Not cost effective)
  2) You buy them 
  3) You deliver a service/good in exchange for bitcoins.
This is all fine and dandy. The problem with bitcoins case 2. As more people start using bitcoins and their value starts to increase it will eventually result in a loss of value for existing currencies. At that point existing currencies will rapidly start to lose their value.
The end result of this is that the early investors will be extremely rich, and the late adopters will be very poor. In other words, this will be a revolution!
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:49:56
Unfortunately you are right. I think this technology is amazing, but the way it is right now is not workable for the non-techies. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:44:53
It was profitable for a little while: 
For many miners the hope is that the value of a bitcoin will increase dramatically, so the coins you mined yesterday at a cost of $1200 a piece, can be sold next year for $10000 a piece.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:20:03
You need to start using cash as well as bitcoins.

The Chinese exchange (BTCChina) is no longer allowing any deposits. This is causing the Chinese to give up on bitcoin for now. China was fueling the explosive growth.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:30:28
No, but you at least can see in the blockchain where your coins went.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:42:58
Yeah, nobody can stop this revolution!
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:24:06
Bitcoins cannot replace currency in the long run without causing a major revolution. The outcome of that revolution is a complete redistribution of wealth where the early adopters will be extremely rich and the late comers will be very poor.

The potential problem with the theory of peak oil is that:
* Applies to every finite resource (nuclear power, gas)

It lost over 25% in its value. Most people consider that a crash.

It is smarter to sell, and buy back, then to hold on.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:41:50
Yes, eventually there will be only a few groups of people who can afford to mine bitcoins effectively. The best way to make money out of mining is to develop mining hardware.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:13:12
Correct. A smart investor would have sold at the peak, and bought back at this point if one believes the price will go back up again.
