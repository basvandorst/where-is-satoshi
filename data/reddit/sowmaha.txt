No it was halved at nov 2012 and the price range was slightly above $11. It didnt reach it's peak up until Nov 2013
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:13:48
wow! this explains why i bought 30 goxcoins and i will buy more as it dips. thank you for clarifying my insanity!
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:08:23
Thxs for the investment advice buddy and the changetip. However it only makes sense that it will take off in the next halving. That is probably why both Roger Ver and Tim Draper predict a price rise and ROI in 2-3yrs. Now I gotta learn how to accept this changetip lol

I was looking at coindesk bpi 
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:32:48
I like it! i like it! sounds reasonable to me, lets get a vote on it
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:08:45
I like this! hail bits!
@_date: 2014-06-04 03:01:13
yea but this doesnt state that i would benefit or get some return on my bitcoins. It just states that fincen can fine me
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:28:47
Hmm, really? How do i file taxes on it. That would be amazing if i can do that!
@_date: 2014-11-11 04:53:28
Yea it def is the best investment in history thus far. However the halving started the year 2012 and the price didn't budge until a whole year later did it reach 260 and up
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:00:56
Thank you!!!!!! you were very helpful man. It all makes sense now. You were right and it gradually increased once the halving took place
@_date: 2014-11-17 08:00:20
Yea I like them too. So far they raised 4 million pounds and they have 2 million pounds to go on Crowdcube. I am rooting for them. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:49:04
too big of a question. Hell i dont know goddamit!
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:00:45
Thank you!!!!!! you were very helpful man. It all makes sense now. You were right and it gradually increased once the halving took place
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:17:45
   bits of a bitcoin sounds better to me. It would make more sense for the masses. I second that SearchForTruthNow2 :)
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:43:56
Man i lost 14 bitcoins. But yea ill try that. Keep it up man. Thanks for the advice bro
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:32:43
why thank you :)

 this is the email sent by one of the staff members on exactly what happened.


@_date: 2015-01-25 16:37:47
Thank you!! I am working on my blog now! It should be up before I leave, so soon. I am not employed actually I am using my savings. Once I land and start posting, there will be a bitcoin address to donate to the cause, anything will help. I will be posting every event I have and hopefully raise awareness. I was in east africa two years ago and there is huge potential for bitcoin there.
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:17:53
Send me a direct message
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:40:58
To calm everyone down, no they did not access my funds at all! this is the email sent by one of the staff members on exactly what happened. 
"Sounds like your phone somehow became unsynced to your wallet. Normally the solution for this is to log into your wallet through the web and using the pairing QR code found in Account Settings to reestablish your phone's connection to your wallet. From reading your reddit post I'm assuming you didn't have a chance to write down your actual wallet identifier in the time you had the wallet open did you? So our first step will be trying to find your wallet identifier. I can do this by searching for the email associated with your wallet if you have one. Or I can cross reference the date you created the wallet and your password, which in the case of mobile phones is your PIN# three times in a row by default." 
So no worries, once I accessed my wallet identifier I was back in business. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:04:45
It's all about the pitch. Strategy. Living here in the west is a blessing because we have soo many options at hand that bitcoin comes off as a fly on the wall when it really is the wall and all other payment methods are the fly. 
However in Africa all they deal with is digital currency especially east africa.  All those countries cannot transact with eachother so it hampers trade. This would make a killing there.
All hotel services have no online revenues and I personally know a few who are trying to get online but dont know how to capitalize. I can go on forever
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:34:29
what do you mean by empty password??
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:04:20
yea I am a bit scared now because it wont let me enter my pin. I hope support can fix this!
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:12:10
If anyone is selling in connecticut please let me know i am willing to buy alot of bitcoins in person in a public place today and the coming weeks!!
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:01:17
That kind of helped but i never put in a password so when i go that route it wont let me login it says "authorization required please check your email. And it will send me an email and than the link and than say ""authorization required please check your email" it's like repetition and I am going in circles!
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:12:55
My main concern is trade. Once currency like bitcoin can empower the unfortunate, but there are tons of opportunities in terms of trade and employment for African youths, women and African Diaspora.
We have all heard that Africa is not really rising, I say it is rising, however, it is only rising for a very small set of Africans, not up to 1000 Africans. That is because there is an extremely discriminate availability of growth, development and trade to the ordinary African.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:07:09
Yea they dont deal with U.S base customer anyways, smh so that leaves that out. Thanks tho
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:07:49
No because when i type the wrong pin on purpose just to see what happens, the app states "incorrect pin, 3 attempts left" but when i type the right pin it says success but doesn't budge!!
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:12:41
Dont provide blockchain.info!!! I just lost 1.2 bitcoins. Look at my profile for proof. The app froze and my bitcoins are now in limbo!  I dont want to discredit blockchain.info but the app is to risky to use! this all happend to me today! if you want to use blockchain stay away from its app because if it freezes and you dont use the web your bitcoins can be lost. This is a warning to all bitcoin users
@_date: 2015-01-31 04:18:24
Your welcome  and thanks man!
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:20:48
Yea it didnt work out man. Every trader is in New york, Thanks for the help tho!!!
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:28:52
Exactly my point!!!!! I entered my pin and it say "success" but it wont let me login!! THATS THE PROBLEM! It generated the address the minute i created the app and confirmed my pin by typing it twice
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:01:53
Sorry, I wont be traveling to west Africa. I wish for the best for all african youths who are dealing with the backlash issues of ebola. I will be in Africa for three to six months. Due to a lack of time I wont be able to travel all of Africa. it will take considerable amount of time introducing bitcoin to many business and holding events and conference meetings in East Africa alone. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:25:13
That's scary man! I am deeply sorry for your loss! I have an email attached  and a pin that's all. I never created a password for it, so I dont have to worry about loosing my password
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:49:16
I am in the advertising and promotions field. I have been in the bitcoin arena since 2013. I have traveled to Africa before as well and noticed the potential.  Yes I am doing this on my own will :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:03:16
Thanks for the invite!
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:36:38
Yes thank you for clarifying. It's best we bring this stuff up so people can be aware and cautious. I am not saying blockchain.info is untrustworthy but it will make their services better. I have faith this will get resolved though i am a bit scared on the outcome because 320 is 320 the end of the day.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:54:46
Lucky! bro I wish I was in your shoes man!
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:41:01
Who knows! it's better to be safe than sorry and just buy bitcoins. Price down pick up!
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:03:00
thank you I will. Yeah kenyans adapt fast. I think thats speaking for all africans in Africa!
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:07:35
Shut up idiot. Dont act like your not worried about the price moron. Inflation reduces the real value of money over time; conversely, deflation increases the real value of money
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:39:06
It is now saying "There was an error validating the PIN code with the server. This may be because you are not conected to the internet or blockchain.info is currently down" I am slowly loosing hope for my 1.2 bitcoins and I have yet to hear back from blockchain.info 
@_date: 2015-01-31 05:09:31
did both :)
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:44:37
ok thanks im using it now!
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:24:00
Yes that is correct!!!! please tell me it's fixable you just gave me renewed hope!! I can't login through the site. I turned my phone off and turned it back on but nothing changed. I am afraid that if i delete the app and download it again it will all be gone!! let me try resetting my phone
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:14:58
thanks bro! appreciate your help man! I posted a new post to bring awareness to the situation! Lets hope it gets resolved
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:11:54
password for what???
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:39:05
How does it work? I am looking at their site now
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:47:53
I never tied it to a password only an email address so in my email there is a link but no password when i click on the link it requires a password. Something i never typed or entered! I never entered a password. I only used a pin on my phone as the setup was on my phone and it keeps saying success but never lets me login!
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:33:59
Your welcome! 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:00:14
Exactly my point! now you see the vision.  Good call and well said!

@_date: 2015-01-25 01:39:30
There is no enter button you have to type the pin numbers 
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:40:17
Thanks but I only want to buy 500 worth at the moment and as i trust a user i will buy more. The problem is their is no one to available. They take forever to reply because they want to wait as the price rises smh. What do you think about 24/7exchange? are they legit? You can buy bitcoins with a debit card
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:38:37
Thank you!  The blog should be up soon!!

That is def something I have in mind. Currently their is bitpesa who is going through the regulatory terms in Kenya and trying to get a market share their as they struggle for power because they have established competitors. So if anything we will try to help them expand by building awareness. In the meantime we will be working on an alibaba type of site that takes bitcoins. Africans have many products and argiculture goods that they trade  with eachother so their is potential there and so much more.

Iknow!!!!!!!! we in there like swimwear lool
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:47:12
Well said, sorry I couldn't respond sooner to clarify the issue at hand with peoples concern. However, I did clarify it now. Yes you are correct that was exactly the problem and how it was solved. We can't blame bitcoiners for being wary and skeptical about bitcoin business but with a service like blockchain.info they should have no concern on it's security issues.
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:42:20
Ok let me try it! I didnt think of that. Get back to you in a couple of seconds!
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:07:08
Yea libertyx all serivces are in sprinfield and their closed and craigslist is only for new york. smh.
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:26:35
Thanks man, I tried using my pin as a password and that was a no go for online. I dont have that option on my phone. When I enter my pin it says "success" but it wont let me login :(
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:48:50
Ok guys here is the update!! Apparently there is no traders in connecticut on this app. The nearest one is 96 kilometers thats over 50 miles which they live in New York!!! FML and there is no bitcoin atms in Connecticut. If you love bitcoin stay the hell away from connecticut! 
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:46:20
The base will be in East Africa. Send me a message to discuss further!
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:22:14
It was resolved in the end

@_date: 2016-02-26 02:04:09
Congrats to you to! Yea I lived in my moms basement, take the city bus instead of driving and cook home cooked meals for the past 3 years to keep expenses low. I know I didnt make as much as you but I will probably start a business as well but first might start traveling once augur is released. Bitcoin Halvening I got my eyes on. Power to the millennials
