We should not need the community to protect it, the protocol and tech should be able to manage it but humans are a sneaky bunch and will always look for ways to get ahead (which is a good thing).
People underestimate how sneaky us humans can be and how much big players are willing to risk for massive rewards. A small group could throw 100 million cash at a chance for 5 billion and have fun doing it.
If there was a big block of 40-50k defenders on call that could step in to fuck up there plans, they might not even bother trying.

Mining is currently treated as arbitrage between energy/labor/ancillary/startup costs of actually mining and the cost of bitcoins. I honestly do not think Satoshi thought that part through, the market dictates where the majority of miners actually mine and you end up not being very decentralized without artificially attempting to balance the playing field of miners on a global scale.
Find abundant cheap or free energy as they have in China, couple that with low wages and the mining equipment being made in country and you have a winning solution.
The rest of us do not get to play the arbitrage game and instead pay the cost of the coins on the open market.
    
It is like any other business that tries to turn a profit. You put cash to work and hope to end up ahead in the end, you as a non miner can put cash to work directly by buying bitcoins.

Are hard form could add another decimal place and not change the number of bitcoins.
It would simply allow people to pay 1/10th of a satoshi if that is needed.
Also my gut says 3 million+ bitcoins will never be unlocked and are gone forever (or until quantum computers break the crypto). Also if that crypto gets broken then everything gets broken (the web, normal banking, phones, computers etc etc).

Missing something big.
The bid and ask can and do move massively without a buyer/seller.
Yes some were sold at 2500 a tiny few were sold off at 2800 but then buyers dried up, sellers wanted out and the only way out is to lower and lower and lower and lower the ask. A race to the bottom by the sellers scrambling after the few buyers still around. It is not and never is a 1 to 1 ratio.

Different levels of friction
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:15:37
The price of the 'thing' drops and the money vanishes into thin air. 
The only reason it had a price of 1000 or 1400 is because someone was willing to pay that, so then people with the 'thing' look at the last sale price and say 'My things are worth x'
    
When nobody wants to buy, the sellers keep dropping their price on the 'thing' until they find buyers and now the holders of those things now know the current value.
    
In this case the thing dropped hard and that value (not money) vanished. The opposite can happen as well.

Per the UK government official website used to warn travelers:
* Avoid public displays of affection, particularly outside the main tourist areas and near religious places.
* Sexual relations outside marriage are punishable by law. It’s not uncommon for hotels to ask couples to show evidence of marriage at the time of check-in, and if such evidence is not available, to insist on separate rooms.
* Homosexuality is a criminal offence in Morocco. Be sensitive to local laws and customs and avoid public displays of affection. Complaints can lead to prosecution.
* Women, especially when travelling alone, may receive unwanted attention. To minimise hassle, you may choose to wear clothes which cover the arms, legs and chest.
* It is against the law to carry bibles in Arabic, to attempt to distribute any non-Muslim or evangelical literature, or to be involved in any such activity.

I could see one way. A very real and sustained effort to take control of bitcoin by brute force of their market share (4-5 exchanges and 4-5 large mining groups). 
For some, throwing a billion dollars at bitcoin to actually take it over is worth the risk, there are 1000s of billionaires and governments could also attempt it as well. Throw 1 million at 10 good developers too so the code stays current and bug free.
What I describe does not have some tiny chance of happening.

Even at 5% that 20 bucks a week will earn you $1 a year for life and you will still own the $20 at the end of life.
That $1 seems like nothing but putting money to work for you as soon as possible will change your life by 35 or 40 years old (or sooner).
All your friends will be working till 65 or 70 you will be able to retire and do what ever you want at 35 or 40.

@_date: 2017-11-12 11:03:21
That is not true.
The lack of sellers drove the value up, 25 billion in cash did not flow into the asset (BCH). Maybe 1 or 3 billion flowed in. Then when they choose to sell there were not enough buyers so they had to drop their asks to get buyers.
If you buy 2 vintage cars from me for 1 grand each, then you sell one for 10 grand next week, the new market value is set at 10 grand for your remaining car. You then want to sell the other one for 10 grand but no one wants it and I mean no one, I offer you $1 for it and you say fine. The new market value is now $1 per car.
You made 8001, that other guy spent 10 grand but has a car, I made 1999 but down 1 car. All along the timeline the marketcap went from 2 grand to 20 grand and down to $2. No one lost 19,998.
Value can vanish and spring into existence, tangible goods do not, they are destroyed or crafted/created. Goods (assets) and value are very different things.

Your own chart says differently, 12k by April
If you redraw your lines it could be 9700
If you account for continued exponential adoption it could be closer to 30k

I have been buying at the ATH (or close to it) for months now. Never sold.
So Buy High Never Sell is working for me.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:18:15
Only because 20 times $20 is only $400
The thing is most of those at higher levels now were at those lower levels a while ago in life.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:41:17
You should be out earning cash so that you have -extra- to put to work for you.
$30 is not extra cash, it is a good steak or some gas in your car (not being mean). 
My point is you need to refocus on earning more than your current expenses so that you have 6 months of extra cash, then begin investing and putting money to work.

Shilling for a backwards country is retarded but keep trying.

Is that a challenge? :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:41:20
You make a new wallet with just $10 in it. You send them the whole wallet, trust is not an issue for $10. The rest of your coins are still perfectly safe.
I could do this right now with $1 for you and post it here in reddit for you if you wanted.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:39:13
Good luck keeping 500 wallets for 7 years, logistical mess.

Find me an able bodied adult in America that can't make an extra $200 in a month...rake or cut a lawn, shovel a drive way, cut some wood with an axe and sell it on the side of a road, beg for it on the side of the road (probably get that in 2 days).
The people barely making a living, probably drink,smoke (cigs or pot), takes pills, buy scratch offs etc etc etc or simply eat out instead of cooking at home. They have horrible money management skills.
Plop me down any place in America, with zero cash and I will have $200 fast.
That said we are not really talking about homeless people investing in anything, they most likely have mental issues which are not being treated by the state (because we shut down all the mental institutes and dumped them on the streets).
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:52:32

I sent $1 for 226 satoshis (just over 1 penny) yesterday. It took a couple hours to go through at 3pm EST
I did it to see how low of a fee I could go with and still have the transaction happen, wondering if it does not happen then what happens and how long before it gives up :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:42:05
True if the variance is high enough, consolidate and redo it, you could even set up a script to do it for you.

So she is in charge, got it. And you want to be in charge but have let her be in charge because reasons.

You are still 100% wrong and confused, I really hope you never run a business.

Are you retarded?

I can send $5 for 2 pennies right now today.
It will take a few hours to clear but people are not out there stealing hamburgers left and right.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:02:24
Nope the 6k to 7k in now the new range, you are in the dip now.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:09:55
You are confused about some very simple concepts, everyone reading your posts sees your complete lack of basic understanding.
That lead me to conclude you should be no where near being in charge of running a business.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:45:54
You over estimate the stability of the dollar. While a trillion seems like a lot, in 5 years it won't be and within 10-12 years we will have trillionaires.

He really must have needed the $100 
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:56:12
Until he turns 17 gets hooked on opioids, turns to heroin and then takes the ledger nano and trades the coins for a weekend fix. No I am not saying this is 100% going to happen but shit goes sideways and you need a layer of security to stop a dumb teenager from making a horrible mistake.
You should use some sort of dead man's switch to unlock a key for him. Don't tell him about the switch.
All that said, you are doing the right thing in setting your child up for the future.

Thats a fun reason, but it sounds like she has that on lock down too.

Warren Buffett has no idea what the tech is behind bitcoin (not even at a rudimentary level), he should be giving as much advice on bitcoin as I give on raising orphaned zebras in Antarctica.

Just double the size of the red flag blocks duh
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:19:56
Start digging around looking for ways to make money to turn that into bitcoin.
If you are physically able and in the US, you should have no problems making extra cash.
Spending time on reddit...not so productive (I don't need extra cash)

You can preload a dozen wallets slowly and cheaply with $5 $10 and $20 then text or email them the key to that wallet, no fee and instant.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:36:48
Thank you

He should be using that as a guide when trying to give out advice about bitcoin, but instead he wades in and spews nonsense.

Might as well use this $

One difference is if you have a decent bank roll, banks and investment companies will actually come to your house and walk you through investing traditionally. Very few people can find people to help them one on one unless it is a friend already involved.

I have simply replied, buy it and forget about it (don't lose your keys).
Most people will never ever ever care enough to spend time learning about it. 
How many people in your family care about coding or even how to use a PC beyond email and the web. Not many. To expect them to learn or to even honestly understand the bitcoin basics is dreaming.

Would be interested in some sort of software that let you dictate exactly how much of your GPU that you wanted to mine with.
Yes it would suck at mining but if 50,000 people ran it, it would help with decentralization.

My record is 120 hours worked in a single week while sleeping at the job site. I have been down to nickels at times in my life.
My assertion stands and I will stand by it. Laziness, or spending money on junk (poor money management or none at all) or vice is the driving force behind being broke.

Does it help at all to run without the ports forwarded (which limits it to 8 connections vs 100).
