**My advice:** Take care of your private keys and remember that while you control the "privkeys" of the address where the bitcoins are deposited, those bitcoins are yours (that is, you are your own bank), while **if a company or organization controls them, they are your Bank**.
At bitcoinland this is a necessary reflection: **How much and to whom are you willing to entrust your money?**
If you do not know what private keys are, you should read about it and make sure you understand it well.

Someone could well make comparisons of the writings of that opportunist to prove that he is not Satoshi Nakamoto, right? Would not it be much easier?

That's bad advice. The ideal is to have one or more copies stored in different places ... but **all of them well guarded**.

I don't know how to encrypt files. How can I do that? And what is usually encrypted? A txt file?

Convincing the taxi driver would have had his merit, but he also has to have met the immediate needs of the man who needed the cash.
