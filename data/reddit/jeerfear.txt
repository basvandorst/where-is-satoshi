Now that sounds fun. Mr McAfee approves.
@_date: 2019-11-23 16:36:18
Hmmm...not likely, but would make for a hell of a movie.

I don’t know about traditional state vs state conflict, but I do very much forsee an artificial credit crunch that will lead to revolution across many countries.
@_date: 2019-11-25 19:53:23
So buy high sell low?
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:06:43
Chillax bro, I’m producing theories based off of little evidence. But I think it’s important to explore aside from the day to day crypto talk other possibilities. Don’t get offended.

For the most part I’m tech illiterate, but that sounds like IPFS to me. Cuts down on infrastructural redundancy as well.
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:47:50
Possibly doctored
@_date: 2018-10-02 00:08:18
Of course you don’t need coins. Haven’t you heard of IPFS?

Used to hit up bars. Boring stuff. Either old ladies yelling at screens or ugly chicks dancing on you. Meh.

Cared enough to comment I see. Suck it.
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:55:30
Time to sell?
@_date: 2018-10-01 21:52:15
Open source 0’s and 1’s don’t hold any value in themselves. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:02:47
Kinda insignificant to the discussion don’t you think? 
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:03:16
But you do acknowledge gold actually has a value outside of being a medium of exchange? Doesn’t matter what the price is if it’s setting prices. Your money has to be underwritten in a commodity because otherwise it doesn’t exist. Whether that be paper or 0’s and 1’s. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:39:28
USD and Euro have no value. Neither does Bitcoin. That’s why they’ll all fail. 
The central banks know this, that’s why they would have created bitcoin (essentially a new currency) to alleviate the side effects of QE. 
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:49:36
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:13:54
It doesn’t matter if it succeeds, arguably it has succeeded as a medium of exchange. I’m not saying we have a totalitarian government, all I’m saying is that bitcoin is the perfect solution to USD inflation. We haven’t really seen any consequence of the feds QE. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 20:35:29
Yeah you sold to me, I want my refund. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:14:59
I’m not denying that. I’m simply postulating that perhaps the central banking system is behind the popularization of bitcoin as a means of burning monetary surplus. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:05:20
You see, but that’s not the problem. They aren’t giving any power away because crypto isn’t anything. It doesn’t have any intrinsic value. Nothing is lost when one is lost. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:22:41
Well Bitcoin has no value. It’s air or magical fairy dust. The ramifications are that you have all been played by the central banks into paying a speculative tax or a greed tax. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:47:53
The best monetary system is one pegged in a commodity. You can have an index or use a single one like Gold. There has to be a purpose and real world application to your MoE, otherwise it’s quite abstract to the economy at large. 
Value or values are what people hold and they can typically be used to measure standards of living. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:03:43
You have to feel kind of skeptical when libertarians start acting like sheep and develop a herd like mentality.  My love for Peter Schiff has allowed me to escape this mentality unscathed. Just hoping many others can consider heeding his calls. I originally fell in love with crypto when Adam Kokesh had Charlie Shrem on his show, but I must admit I have always felt it as too good to be true. 
@_date: 2019-11-23 16:32:12
Bullish or bearish, they both equally suck. They don’t treat it with any respect.
@_date: 2018-10-02 00:49:34
Yes. Orangeman is yellowman 
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:09:00
Well the potential ramifications of bitcoin being created by the government or central banking system are huge. You can dismiss and even be hostile to my theory, but at least have the decency to provide a proper retort or otherwise just not comment. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:03:19
That’s interesting, didn’t know that.

Thank you, very cool.
@_date: 2019-12-09 18:10:31
So you’re saying I can run a mining rig at a loss? That does sound interesting, will probably incorporate something like that into my btc philosophy of buy high sell low.

You should be fine. If you borrowed from family or friends they should understand. Humble yourself don’t end yourself. No pasa nada.
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:40:24
You can’t beat human nature. So propping up a fake system known as: “The Government” will only serve to legitimize theft and murder.

Mhmmmm. Steak, Salmon, Shrimp! 
Can’t wait to get into the military so I can use all my discretionary income to eat those 3. Oh, and buy some BTC too....I suppose.

What if sell rate increases?

The pyramids were probably created long before 10,000 bc. They were probably very advanced and used some sort of irrigation system. The first settlers of the river Nile delta may have well been aliens....to Egypt.

Ahhhh.. I like it. Even though it is somewhat unethical to tie up lines to promote something.

@_date: 2018-11-03 05:31:37
If, and big IF, that monetary leniency isn’t consumed in asset prices. Like how 90’s inflation went towards a dot com bubble and then to real estate. The central bank may have created the bitcoin bubble to hold some of that excess. 
Remember: the economic definition of inflation is a general rise in the price of goods and services not simply a larger supply of currency. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 02:39:38
Oh yah

Whatever you do don’t encourage them to buy it. Can be illegal and otherwise just shady.

The only theory I want on my money is that it exists in absolute supply. After that I don’t care.

Inflation under 2% for 5 years since last round of QE. Billion dollar market cap in crypto.

Well it makes sense, they wouldn’t accept Turkish Lira from you either.

Would be funnier if the guy inside said “it’s a bubble” and the guy outside cried.

The basis of private property is secrets. If you need the protection of the state your secret probably isn’t that valuable since you trust the public to know but not execute it.

Feeling bad for you son. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:38:22
Damn straight. But I think most people are too lazy and irresponsible to be trusted with something as “complicated” as bitcoin. Maybe if there were Bitcoin checkbooks and physical notes we could see some mass adoption. Banks would take care of the rest.
