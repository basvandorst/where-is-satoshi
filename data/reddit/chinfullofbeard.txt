What a shit post. If you really tried to be legit you would have at least posted pictures with that homeless girl to verify its legitimacy. Scum bag

I don't know the meaning but me taking a guess, I think it has to do with the infamous Bitcoin puzzles that came with rewards if solved.

Wish I owned this piece, but damn it cost 3k! I have no idea how art is valued so maybe it's somewhat worth that

It's funny how much hate BTC gets from the salt herd. If you actually take a moment to reflect and think how amazing this is, it's pretty incredible. Actual Bitcoin stores opening up and ATM's being placed all over the world like we see here daily and we haven't even come close to adoption phase yet. Can you only imagine what it would be like when adoption truly does start happening... The transition will be pretty smooth from fiat to BTC and that's what we need to hope for, a peaceful transition.

This is a little scary to me conisdering we are seeing these ads everywhere including in the ads in the new york times.  
   
Do you guys think this is just wealthy companies expanding there name or do you guys think there is a deeper plot that revolves around pump and dumps and taking peoples money ?

But was it not speculation at the time?

Man I had that same gut feeling on a lot of the posts. Definitely have to take notes on this.

Thanks a lot I appreciate this. Please sticky more posts like this. The very informative posts never sustain traction on the top and it's pretty sad :[

I see a lot of haters in this sub of JP and I have yet to see any of these haters justify the hate. If you disagree with JP on anything, than you should be able to prove him wrong and if you can't than you're just the typical guppy in the pond who spreads nothing but logical fallacy

I doubt you can make 3-5 a day with a rx480. It also depends on your electricity costs. But you'd have to invest in a lottt of rx480 to start seeing a profit and it would probably take months to make back your investment before you start seeing any profits.  
  
Look for a bitcoin mining calculator, that should give you a better idea of what to expect in profits

I highly doubt you can win any argument if you were to challenge Jordan Peterson so who is the real intellectual wannabe?  
  
And if you are confident than in what terms can you prove Jordan Peterson to be wrong? He seems pretty content and knows how to stay on the logical spectrum versus the emotional one.

Does he support heirarchy though? I would semi-agree that it's natural but I do not support it. It's natural in the sense that humans rely on leaders.Humans are dependant and weak and leaders can easily take advantage of that which is why I do not support hierarchy but I do believe it's partially natural and the part that I do not believe is natural is a lot of hierarchy comes from manipulation which in this case would argue that it's not natural? For example men are pretty much ranked above women, as far as I understand this was always the case and it may or may not be natural, it may be natural if this been the case since day 1 of evolution but if this just so happened to become the case later on than it probably wasn't natural and happened through manipulation or logical fallacy.  
  
^that's a little bit of my view on it  
  
I personally don't have an argument on your point on Peterson so I'm still open to that. Would you happen to have a reference that would show how he loses that argument? If not it's fine, I try to remain as open as possible even if it's a 'leader' that I think has good intentions
