It's looking like it may not be. Not all the facts are in, but most of them are. I rounded up the facts on that Facebook thread on my homepage, which you probably saw, but for those who didn't, here's the bulletpoints:
Consider the following:
* I've got sources confirming the 700k figure, or something close to that.
* All the plans of action (clearing social media, taking down the site, and buying Gox.com) have been confirmed independently in different media outlets or sources.
* All the major exchanges had a presser ready to go this evening, and planned press events for the day after.
* in my background conversations with different folks named in the consortium, they weren't aware of this doc floating around, so the release of the presser and the leak of the doc were independent coincidental events.
Not sure I lean towards "well planned op." Given how Gox has an historic propensity to screw things up through stupidity, this all sorta passes my sniff test.

I can tell you as someone who had to edit thousands of words a week that you can be competent as an engineer, and not be able to adhere to an blog's stylebook (readable, punctuated, and paginated), let alone an AP stylebook.

"David Clark is one of the original inventors of TCP/IP.  From 1981 to 1989, he acted as chief protocol architect in the development of the Internet, and he is currently a Senior Research Scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory."
"theCube's Dave Vellante interviewed him at a recent event at MIT, and broached the topic of Bitcoin. I expected him to have an admiration of the protocol's ability to solve a certain set of problems without constant oversight. He acknowledged it's ability to do so, but also talked in depth about the challenges with applying the "protocol approach" to solving all the worlds' problems."

* HP, EMC, Cisco, IBM and other players in the enterprise space take Bitcoin.
* Dell convinces members of their supply chain to take Bitcoin.
Right now, we (the BTC community) have great momentum in the B2C movement, but what I'd like to start seeing more stories about would be in the B2B world. 
When a B2C company starts convincing it's supply chain and partners to also participate in the Bitcoin economy, you'll see the value of the network begin to accelerate, since less value will be going back into fiat.

Yes, it's true, but it's hardly the friggin' story. Everyone in all of Bitcoin knew about this. It wasn't a bug, it was a known issue. If you can't plan around something that's known by everyone to happen, that's on you, not everyone around you.

So it isn't exactly accurate to say that CEX.IO/GHash.io is the source of the problem simply because a doublespend attempt came from them before. That implies impropriety on GHash.io's part. Any participant in the pool could have been as guilty of the impropriety. Who owns the pool is inconsequential. Remember, this occurred when they were only 24% of the hashing power of BTC.
I also think that based on what is being released hardware-wise over the next couple of months that we'll see GHash.io/Cex.io's share decrease markedly.

You are correct that they'd do it in-house, not farm it out to BitPay. 
Amazon discourages cross-department communication that occurs outside of APIs. What would likely happen would be a task force or department that focuses on Bitcoin processing, which would be utilized company-wide.
There would be a great deal of training that would have to happen, and some security and hedging options that would need to be implemented... 
... that said, the benefit to using the Bitcoin network really lies with the vendor. The savings in not having to deal with chargebacks, fraud, and other issues relating to the frailties of the credit card and banking system could offset these costs considerably (not to mention the boost in value to Bitcoin caused by a big player entering the network).

That's not entirely true.
Buy some mining equipment (there's plenty of cheap stuff out there that won't kill you in kilowatt hours) so you understand how it works, and set up P2Pool, then get to work on making it easier for others. Just because you're not directly involved with mining doesn't mean you can't help those who are. 
Bitcoin, among many other things, is a community. If you like Bitcoin, it's in your best interest to help out things that even only indirectly support your pocketbook.
The unwillingness or shortsightedness for those not directly involved in the mining community is similar to the ideology in corporate America that lead to everyone *using* OpenSSL, but not actually *doing* anything to prevent Heartbleed.

Dig deeper. You are mistaken.
"A human organization can be defined as combination of two things: a set of property, and a protocol for a set of individuals (which may or may not be divided into certain classes with different conditions for entering or leaving the set) to interact with each other, including rules for under what circumstances the individuals may use certain parts of the property.
The idea of a decentralized organization takes the same concept of an organization, and decentralizes it. Instead of a hierarchical structure managed by a set of humans interacting in person and controlling property via the legal system, a decentralized organization involves a set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol specified in code, and enforced on the blockchain."

The internet as a whole is a wealth of data around what you seek. At best, you're foolishly allowing yourself to be goaded into conversations with people you hold no respect for, and having the same conversations over and over again.
At worst, you're a troll. If I had just picked your name out of the bucket and called you a troll, you may have had a point, but I've seen you, specifically, in the same types of conversations over and over again.

As someone who's been a bitcoin enthusiast for the last three years and endured first the ridicule, then the ire, then the admiration of my peers for being a nut for cryptocurrency so long, I can understand how there's very little sense of humor about this anymore. Part of it is being relegated to the basement of internet forums to talk about this stuff (where all sense of decorum goes to die). 
The other part is being, essentially, a visible champion and thought leader on a topic, and then seeing folks who literally three or four months ago were vocal critics of Bitcoin with large platforms turn around and get interviewed on CNN or some other large soapbox as a "Bitcoin expert."
It's a little irritating.

But 1) you can't take Microsoft from the equation (if it wasn't for competition, there'd be a monopoly. ahduh) and 2) that's the US market. Globally, they're nowhere close to 70%.
My previous points also stand - where they have dominance is increasingly irrelevant. Mobile is growing at the expense of desktop, and Google is not growing in mobile revenues (relative to the industry).

Why are you here? Why is tearing down other people this fun for you? Go get a life. There is literally infinite number of things for you to do that won't remind you of how much you think Bitcoin sucks.

Why is it bullshit? They're highly incentivizing Bitcoin participation, but they're also well within their rights to incentivize fiat participation.

I've been holding from every value between $11 and $1200. I've acquired BTC at pretty much every point along that scale.

Also, the 2 disapproved ads were for a Stephen Colbert meme-graphic about Bitcoin. Reasoning was it contained too much text.

My biggest problem with the Blockchain app (android user here) is that I can't ever seem to figure out how to tap in a USD amount and have the BTC equivalent show up. If I'm using the mobile app, chances are I'm making a vendor purchase or splitting a bill. Loading up a third party app to verify the BTC price is cumbersome.

Yes, posted this after I read your post but before I saw your followup comment. 
I'd be curious to see exactly what was abusive about his trades. Your follow up does seem like there's more "there, there" than the post.

Update: Coinbase killed the part of the title of the blog post that mentioned MtGox's insolvency. Circle still has the initial title up on their site. I expect it'll change soon as well. We still have solid confirmation of the 700k figure. More as it comes.

I am not him, and can't tell you exactly what he meant by that, since I didn't ask a follow up question.
I know that I'll never keep Bitcoins in a mobile wallet that aren't also backed up elsewhere in multiple places. The only Bitcoins I've ever lost (around 6 or so, back when they were worth almost nothing) were on the predecessor to the mycelium wallet. 
I don't blame the wallet, but the form factor. A phone isn't hard to steal, lose or break. In my case, my device reformatted itself during an Android system update, and I lost all of my appdata, including my bitcoin wallet.

This isn't my cause (the GHashio/Cexio thing). I'm with Andreas, personally, and don't think this is as huge of an issue as the subreddit makes it.

I was reading a reddit post from someone a while back who interviewed there... apparently, according to this poster, they didn't even have a test dev environment. All edits were made on the live site.
Again, believable because Gox has a track record of stupidity, but basically, yet another unsubstantiated internet rumor.

He writes for BI. That means he's nominally against BTC, and certainly doesn't have the braincells to try to understand it. Research Blodget, who runs the site. The whole outfit is more or less the laughing stock of the tech press.

This is a horrible idea. How do you imagine killing pooled mining to end for everyone? I mean, can you imagine a draw down where utter chaos would not result?

Why are you even reading this thread? Who are you preaching to? People who don't support 3D printing are probably not going to support dark markets.
"I'm not a fan of food stamps. I don't think I can support governmental unemployment insurance."
Same thing. 
Moreover, your statement that distributed tools like this are "grossly irresponsible" seems like being philosophically opposed to screwdrivers because they look a lot like a weapon you can stab with. 
Tools for the facilitation of trade, good and bad, aren't themselves bad. How they're used can fall all over the morality spectrum, but the tool itself is neutral.

I had this issue with my Google Apps account email (after I migrated it there from a previous email provider). I had to get into Google Apps at the server/account-wide level to turn off the option that was something like "discard all spam messages for this domain." 
If you're on Google Apps, I'll go in and look for the checkbox and tell you how it find it.

The same number of coins would be created, regardless of how many miners are applied to the cause.

What's your data to support that? 
Me personally, I'm not liquidating my coins, my balance stays the same, but I buy and replace, where BitPay (and other ecosystem partners) make a percentage. I have to assume any hodlers would also be motivated to do the same thing - support the ecosystem by buying and replacing.

I am the executive producer for a live news program called theCube (we're  on Twitter) as well as an early adopter of BTC (got in at $16). We frequently go out to enterprise events and very rarely does the interest between enterprise tech and Bitcoin cross over. This week we're broadcasting from Barcelona at HP Discover.
This week, because SiliconANGLE (our parent organization) is known for covering Bitcoin, we've been getting a lot of questions from guests and passers-by at the show, so I made a rare-ish appearance in front of the camera to brain dump with the hosts and the audience on the topic.
I know didn't do a perfect job explaining everything, but I did try to cover everything in a fair and accurate way while still being accessible to a large audience of intelligent geeks who were bitcoin newbs.

This ignores the network effect. Many news organizations use subreddits as a blotter for their own coverage.

Perhaps it would be more apt, but our style guide specifies *photography,* not flat images.

I've been covering Bitcoin for the last few years at SiliconANGLE, and we tend to use the pictures of physical coins in absence of something more relevant because it's our editorial guidelines require state that we need to use a photo (not just a logo of a site) that goes with every post. There are several reasons behind that editorial decision/guideline that I can go into if you care to ask, but most blogs have similar rules.
