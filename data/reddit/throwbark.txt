Statistical analysis on hand histories can(and regularly does) catch collusion pretty easily. 
*Reference needed. Another problem with these sites is that they are known for running "fractional reserves". AKA the site operators run off with large portions of the players' depositted cash. That's how EmpirePoker and PartyPoker went down, iirc.

90+% of all people will avoid it because of the poliitical branding. If you actually want people to use it, drop the propaganda.

They didn't get a search warrant to knock over the Silk Road server in Europe, and they didn't include any significant technical details of that process in discovery. I don't see how the prosecution is going to get around the fact that their entire case is based on "poisoned" evidence. In fact, what the prosecution did to obtain the "evidence" is ostensibly a serious computer crime under current laws.

Poker sites like this are known for being a terrible bet. There's no way to prevent collusion among the players.

OK but what is the point of even using a Trezor if you are going to keep all the info that would be needed for recovering the funds on a device that is *less secure* than the Trezor? Am I talking in circles here?

Laser-engraving metals like that is really difficult. They are reflective once the outer oxidized layer gets blasted away, plus they are very hard, especially Tungsten. Standard engraving or [marking lasers]( in the range of $3-$5K won't etch Lead or Tungsten.

Nah, haven't played poker in like 8 years. Would never play online.

Thanks for this detailed analysis, Great work on the Ethereum project, btw. 
I like the idea of proof-of-donation, it's a worth-while effort to try and implement that, I'd say. I'm wondering, in either case, if proof-of-burn or proof-of-donation would be a security weakness, because it leads to some level of de-anonymization of the seller by linking their identity to a blockchain transaction. The sending address would be known to belong to the seller. Senders would have to use some method of obscuring the original source of the funds. Even using newly-mined coins could be dangerous, it seems. You would have to mine coins through an anonymizing network like Tor and then create the transaction also using Tor, I guess.

If there is any integrity left in our justice system, his case will be thrown out on illegal search and seizure.

It's almost as if they have some sort of vested interest in dissuading people to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-27 02:57:57
There must be a better way to have a working reputation system than proof-of-burn. I'm all for people burning their bitcoins though, makes mine more valuable.

Tying your business to a political ideology will only drive away a large part of your userbase. I suggest rebranding without the anarchist message.

Delivering a year late means these things are worth about 1% of what the would have been worth on time.

I don't trust the Trezor, either ;)

If there was a real Galt's Gulch, they wouldn't advertise it.

That's over 15% APR guaranteed? This is a scam. If you invest, you will lose your money.
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:10:55
In the name? Anarchists are like 1% of the population, tops. Unless you want a service that 99% of people will immediately decide not to use, drop the political message.
@_date: 2014-08-10 06:13:22
How is business? Any orders yet?

Honestly I hope NY passes some stupid regulations and gets cut out of the loop on a lot of business opportunities because of it. NY is the most corrupt state, run by insane totalitarian fascists. They don't deserve to be the financial capital of the world any more.
@_date: 2014-08-14 08:40:52
This is by design. The fiat governments want to make it illegal to use bitcoin, and they will try. NY has the most corrupt government of any state in the USA, so it's not surprising this is where the real fight against a legitimate currency would begin.

Android is known to be an insecure operating system with backdoors to US intelligence agencies. So that seems like a pretty insecure way to backup the keys, to me.

*reference needed. "Google" does not count as a reference. Neither do second-hand stories from alleged other players.

Super low tx fees is one of the biggest advantages that the new "Bitcoin 2.0" technologies will have over traditional bitcoin transactions. Open Transactions will have transaction fees on the order of a fraction of a cent, and it will be nearly instantaneous. The client is made to run on cellphones and Africa is definitely a target demographic.

I'd just stay on the old fork and refuse to accept any coins printed on the new fork.
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:08:35
If you traded time and effort to get those bitcoins, then it wasn't a gain, but a trade of value for equal value. To say that income from your work is a "gain" is to say that your work is worth less than what you were paid to do it.

One reason that house prices are inflated is because the government owns almost all mortgages and those mortgages are packaged into derivative investments on Wall St. If house prices were to go down by say 5%, huge losses would be incurred on leveraged securities, bond prices and T-bills would spike, and the Federal Reserve would become insolvent on their debt obligations at the current rate of monetary inflation. This monetary convulsion process caused the housing bubble to "pop" in the last decade, but the mechanisms behind it are still at work. The government is already leaning on mortgage-lenders to relax credit standards again; pushing the lending cycle is a key part of the pseudo-Keynesian economic plan of the central banking sector. The whole process presents a barrier to land ownership, unless you want to tie yourself into indentured servitude to a bank for an overpriced property for 25 years.

I heard their first fab run produced flawed chips and they had to go all the way back to design stage. Just something I heard, no references though.

You would have to wait a longer time for confirmation as the seller, or use a currency that is more local to your planet.
