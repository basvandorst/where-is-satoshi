Thank you. Every bit helps!

Ok. Gives me an excuse to geek out on something new.
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:34:49
Nah. I buy on coinbase and move to ledger because cb scares me. Probably still have some out there from trading on binance ect. back in 2017 or whenever that was. But I leave it be on ledger now.

Canceled bitcoins go to the forest of a unicorn where snow never falls in winter, leaves never drop in fall, and song birds sing a pleasant tune year round. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:59
I just panic bought!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:41:55
Thanks good info!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:27:28
Honestly coinbase is the best way to get started but shady things are happening just be aware.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:37:09
Roger Ver and Coinbase. The pin to the bitcoin bubble. Who would have thunk it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:22:00
HARK!.. The time of the Flippening is upon us. Bitcoin Jesus now resides in the Coinbase temple. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:15
Hold and use any extra money to buy more bitcoin cheap this weekend!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:36:33
I buy at all time highs or whenever I feel like it. It doesn't matter right now ath's are getting ran over and up in less than a week and It's been that way for months.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:58:09
That number comes from this 2013 post 
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:09:31
Always buy even at ath. In the end it won't matter how much money you have . Only how much Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:15
Yeah I need to look into that screw coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:05
Roger Ver will go down in history as?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:25:55
If you all stop buying now I promise to put in my whole paycheck Friday at 8 am est ok?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:55:08
This too shall pass
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:42:27
No Lambo? WFT?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:27:57
Oh no!! The evil Bcash has corrupted the ETH!!! I bet coinbase is in on it too!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:39:49
I predict it will go below 10k later so I'm gonna sell. But I'm wrong 90% of the time so you may want to buy. But I hope I'm right....God I love this shit!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:22
Wait for 10K then buy the shit out of it
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:24:42
It obviously had a bad effect though. I'm still kinda hoping bcash goes up because they are on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:27:02
My brother just texted me asking if now is a good time to buy in. I basicly told him this same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:11:58
People are cashing out because coinbase shoved bcash's dick down their throats and they didn't like the taste?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:50:35
I bought more and if Bitcoin crashes more I'll buy more. Sorry but I am loving this!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:31:29
Couldn't hurt to get in early
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:43:12
Bcash was not a "bad" coin. Just a bad owner. Depends on how they're raised. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:24:29
Wen moon?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:06:40
If you download Coinbase to an amazon firestick you can wath GDAX on tv and you can put the firestick in your pocket like a ledger nano or trezor thing but way cheaper.
@_date: 2019-08-16 00:58:35
Bitcoin finally dead. Thank God! I'm gonna a little more. For old times sake.
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:15:15
Every time I see it I buy a little more.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:34:32
1 BTC =1 million$ EOY.

Personally I received a tax return and am now waiting for a dip or a little fud. This means btc will likely only skyrocket and not return to these levels for some time. Tuesday 10,000$ maybe. I am not an expert. Past performance is not indicative of future gains.
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:29:41
The bitcoin time traveller's story on Reddit still holds up. Buy the dip.
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:23:51
i think 4% for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:46:22
BigMac coin is not a coin but a token?
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:48:45
Looks like a bubble. When moon?

Your dreams are evil. Keep them to yourself. ��
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:00:14
6000-7000$ I'll buy some satoshi but not now. It may go lower. Let that shit crash. I want some 1$ bitcoins. Then I'll buy a bunch sit on an exchange throw them all at a sell wall and lose because I'm a fucking moron.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:55:11
I've got a 14$ call option on USO ����. Expires 5/17. I could part with it for like $50.00 (USD).
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:43:22
The old ones call it "TAKE PROFITS".
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:52:22
Buy more Bitcoin. Bring down the walls/wales!!!
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:45:08
Buy more bitcoin now. Don't sue me if it didn't work out later.
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:12:17
That s what scares the shit out of me. But i take responsibility for my actions. Ever seen r/wallstreetbets.?
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:53:24
According to the bitcoin time traveler we hit 100,000$ this year then 1,000,000$ in 2021. He hasn't been wrong yet.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:54:09
Real DD.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:57:50
Can you make a TA chart from it? Please post it.
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:04:40
Well it gets pretty wild tbh.
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:02:45
I don't know how to make a link but you can Google bitcoin time traveler it's a reddit post from? I think 2013 or so.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:35:03
I won't fomo. I sell at 8000. If this is a changing of the gaurd. I'm fucked. I'll fight to work and retire on fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:48:43
It always starts with $100��
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:48:18
Personally I'm gonna sell when it doubles to 8000 and hope for no regrets.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:02:42
I buy when it's low then it skyrockets into a big spike. Then I sell when the spike goes all the back down. So I've got it half right.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:31:39
Who cares I have .07 bitcoin. And I'm looking to make it more. You should feel the same. ��.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:11:09
Yep i got back in around 4000$. Glad i did.
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:06:53
Yep i just reread as much of it as I could handle yesterday. Still an interesting post.
