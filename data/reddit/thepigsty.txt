Damn. That was an awesome breakdown. 
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:39:36
That is a terrible argument. If no one ever spends BTC, it's worthless. If people quit collecting beanie babies, it doesn't matter that at one point a rare one went for X amount. When thousands of collectors dwindle to dozens, the price bottoms out and there are more than enough beanie babies to satiate the collectors. 
The more people that use BTC as a currency, the more stable the price will be.  If no one used it as currency, the price would fall through the floor. 
 


I'm not accepting BTC because it's a 'hip thing worth a try'. I'm accepting BTC to further mass adoption and for the simple fact that I've been invested personally and want to continue to grow that investment.

I buy it with fiat from the business.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:24:22
I'm all for it! I own small amounts of multiple alt coins, and plan to integrate them as well. This was my jumping off point to test the waters. If anyone shows interest in other coins I will definitely offer support.

From the customers perspective, the business. 
From everyone elses perspective, me.
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:41:06


Yes! You found us!

The pizza oven exhaust was my original plan but I like this one also!
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:08:45
Sorry for the lack of introduction; I'm Aaron, the GM for the last 7 years :)
We have a greenhouse directly behind where I'm standing where I grow a variety of microgreens, making us a 'farm to table' restaurant with no middle man is how I like to think of it.
We also have 2 gardens on site, growing a multitude of heirloom tomatoes that go on our salads as well as over a dozen different varieties of hot peppers that we turn into our signature Diablo Sauce. I also grow about a dozen types of herbs here that we use on our pizzas. Anything I can do here in house, I do.  (I have a DTG t-shirt printer in my office where I print our uniforms and our signage, including this sign.
In general, my goal is to stay ahead of the curve in anyway possible; freshest ingredients, newest payment methods, etc.

As soon as my state votes it in, probably will.
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:50:03
Not yet!
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:55:17
I'll definitely check into it. I'm unfamiliar with the celsius network, just browsed their website and it looks interesting for  sure.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:09:28
Awesome, next time you're downtown stop and say hi!
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:28:51
LMAO! That is awesome, I'm going to need a larger printer.
Or print smaller sections and piece them all together...I feel another project coming on!
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:48:55
Our current POS does not have any BTC integration. I'm really just buying the business' BTC with my personal cash at the end of each day.  I'll get a better solution as soon as I figure one out!
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:29:56
Almost 0. We've had 1 that I can remember. Haha
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:36:34
Thanks! One is about 30' x 8', the other is about 20' x 3' and they run along either side of our building. The tomatoes and peppers produce more than enough this time of year, I still supplement from our produce supplier whenever my supply runs low or plants need time to rejuvenate. The microgreens are always available and are my main focus with the fresh produce, but I have hopes of eventually building a restaurant from the ground up that has a greenhouse on the roof that produces enough vegetables of select varieties to supply the store.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:29:50
Yes we are paying all sales and business taxes on the pizza sold. I will also have to pay Capital Gains when/if I sell out.

Fair market value. It changes constantly but they pay what the price currently converts to. Price change only affects my assets after the sale.
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:37:51


Thanks! I am checking it out right now. Looks promising!
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:12:23
Aside from people double-spending, what do I have to worry about confirmation times from others?
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:26:21
I'll get it set up next week, time permitting.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:46:26
Certainly. Possibly offer discounts to collect more  :)
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:41:02
We are located in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Going worldwide as soon as I get rich backers. Any takers?
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:52:39
As soon as I get some rich backers. Maybe someone here wants to invest their hard earned BTC in a cutting edge brick and mortar establishment? ;)
 We do have a large assortment of liquor, wine, 14 beers on tap, you name it and I try to offer it! Haha
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:08:50
I only need it a few months out of the year but it gets just cold enough to kill everything if nothing is done.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:15:04
I figured that once I get any kinks that may come up worked out I will be ready to actively advertise and promote this feature. I see 20% discounts offered on a variety of sites for payment in BTC, that seems to be the point where people feel it is actually worth it to use.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:16:35
lol I just hung the sign and was excited to show it off!
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:45:35
Exactly, to me it does not matter what the current price is as I'm stockpiling it anyway. I ring up the transactions on our POS as usual and treat it as a cash transaction. When they send me the equivalent of their bill at the current BTC exchange rate, I just pay the drawer cash out of my pocket and keep the BTC.  Eventually I plan to get a POS that supports crypto but for the time being this is my work around.
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:32:26
I'm also debating installing the BATMTWO as there is a serious lack of BTMs in my area. Any advice welcome!
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:45:52
Our prices are in fiat currency as the majority (all) of our customers use it. When someone does want to pay with BTC, we use the current market value of BTC to determine how much needs to be sent.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:20:08
No one yet but I have used it myself just playing around. I was using the Mycellium wallet app, it allows you to set the priority of the transaction and the fee along with that. I just set it to a low priority and it costs 5-10 cents to send 5 dollars. I'm not screwing myself with the long wait times am I?
