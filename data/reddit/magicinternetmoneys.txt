@_date: 2014-07-07 20:07:22
I always get these, I had a recent transaction from a friend and I had a spam tx sent to my address like a second later, they just steal addresses from the recent transactions and spam you with adverts
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:12:16
goxxed :(
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:54:44

OMG BRAH, PLZ TELL ME MOAR!
LIFE STORY PLZ SIR
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:10:42
eh, I was a little paranoid about using a 3rd party to store my holdings. Is my current setup reasonably secure? My funds have been in my addresses for like 5+ months safely...
@_date: 2014-07-12 22:40:19
paper wallet obv, you don't own your bitcoins if you send to any of the others since u don't have the private key.
@_date: 2014-07-13 21:13:31
hey OP, get your account deleted!
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:49:03
yes, it's (my wallet address)
i wouldn't personally trust a donation service via bitcoin, just use FIAT imo.
@_date: 2014-07-08 10:18:56
oh hey 100th post about this, fk off OP.
@_date: 2014-07-16 19:25:43
kewl story brah
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:06:45
They're currently in my hidden safe at my house (pretty dumb) but it's well hidden and fireproof!
I was more worried about did i securely make my cold storage safe?
@_date: 2014-07-13 14:23:12
how lame.....
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:32:41
I'll see myself out...
@_date: 2014-07-21 13:59:19
You sure showed him OP!
I bet the chat operator was shaking in his boots!
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:21:59
sweet jebus, why so many?
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:08:08
I see, it's never good getting tortured.... guess my bitcoins will never be safe!
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:38:11
Eh, I understand where you're coming from - I really do!
It just hurts my OCD when I don't know if my funds are safe. Ha!
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:09:40
That's awesome!
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:04:44
there's enough room for both of them imo.
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:26:51
They need a new sticker :(
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:03:58

+1 TO BIG E-PENIS BRAH
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:11:12
That sucks man, hope they weren't your only coins!
I am too nervous to take my stash out of cold storage, so many people trying to take your coins! :(
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:04:07
Why does your friend have staff that he can't trust?
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:23:35
I have my public addresses written down too, maybe connecting to the internet to download QT isn't the best thing to do.. but i haven't reconnected to the internet using that USB since, it's sitting in a draw incase of emergencies (spending my funds)
Yes, I need to have more copies. I do have a free safety deposit box. Maybe I should look into BIP encryption or something
thx for the replies guys!

@_date: 2014-07-17 00:34:31
fk off OP.
@_date: 2014-07-12 22:36:53
i read that thread, imo the OP should pay the gambler cos they were playing the game the OP allowed them to play.
tl'dr OP is prob shady and wouldn't trust with a single satoshi.
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:30:00
sounds like a MITM attack, wipe that hard drive asap and change all your passwords etc!
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:11:58
