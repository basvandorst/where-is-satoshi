the delay delay of this release sounds more apt. 
Wasn't this screened ages ago?

Okay, lets take your word for it...will report back once tears have been released.
edit: 1.6gb? so the filmmakers want to propel the adoption of a currency for the unbanked by releasing their film in a file size that's convenient for the demographic that can afford and has access to broadband? why is this movie not streaming free somewhere in different resolutions? or rather, what was holding the filmmakers back from asking for support to do something like that when the movie was screened
edit2: will not download till confirmation of the file not being malicious has been received

Really? Surely there is evidence that super-corps like Dell and Paypal can make big mistakes, Just like Madoff's clients.
Hope You're right though.

Am counting on Vitalik Buterin to be recognized as a genius a decade from now

2 - Makes sense i guess
3 - VC funding has never come across as reason to continue hodling as history is littered with their bad calls, it just looks big, if You and I had upwards of 200m, every 5m investment in current trends would make headlines to their respective communities. Their just big gamblers.
4 - Fingers crossed.
5 - They've definitely heard of it, they're not believers yet though.
6 - Regulation itself may render bitcoin neutered from why it came about in the first place.
7 - Billion dollar enterprises are very capable of making mistakes.
Thanks Though :)

Hi Gavin,
Thank You for all your efforts.
Is it possible to make large scale changes to the bitcoin protocol? ex: modifying the mining algorithm
if so, what are some of the challenges that may arise?
if not, why do *you* think the bitcoin protocol is not subject to becoming an aged technology?
Thank you!

Real estate is...real, you can touch it, fence it, grow resources on it. It seems a bit premature to equate digital currency to real estate.
Lets hope these amenities build faith in valuing something we cant see or touch and much less understand, unless you're well educated in the fields of math, cryptography and distributed systems. That is such a huge time investment for those past their prime learning years.
Simply responding to this post makes me think that we are several *years* away from the kind of acceptance we hope to achieve.

Haven't watched, wont download, will assume that the information within it is dated and will not serve as a good use of any ones time
Why did this take so long to release? out of the woodwork you guys come up with a donation address and hope to rally the community for more publicity...really?

Do you know of any published material that confirms this? if so, please share.
The network affect explanation is not sufficient, it didn't do very well for myspace in the long run and its currently dwindling with Facebook.
