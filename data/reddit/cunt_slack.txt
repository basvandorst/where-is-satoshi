np bro! It's not like only the fed prints money and buys bonds from the banks!!!! no way. Definitely a conspiracy dude, private banks DEFINITELY print money and just keep it all cause they're evil! I mean, why do we even have a required reserve ratio, or open market operations??? Banks will just print more anyway!!! Glad we got it figured out, i couldn't have done it without you.

That has nothing to do with the point being discussed, unless of course you would like bitcoin to become our nations currency. And that notion officially puts you in the category of moron, not that you weren't already there.

The idea of a gold standard in the US is fucking absurd, the united states would be fucked if we went to a fixed exchange rate system. Anyone with half a brain and any knowledge of monetary economics knows that! 
Also, "banks" don't just fuckin print money. The Fed prints money, and it does so with the economy's best interest in mind. And every single person who makes decisions there knows SO much more than you about it!!!!! Not that that statement is saying much.

Deflation is bad for an economy. It would stagnate spending and cause unemployment. Look it up.
STOP spewing uninformed opinions and influencing people with bad information.

You just changed your initial point, so I am not going to continue.
