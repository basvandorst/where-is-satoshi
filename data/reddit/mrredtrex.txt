Huh? That's all like french to me lol. I'm new to this. I have all my bitcoin on xcoins and 15% is the lowest they'll allow. I'm in the US but so far no exchange I've found supports my bank or direct paypal cashouts. I'm really just trying to sell all my bitcoin for cash straight up. Help?

That's insane to me. So being a scammer on Xcoins via paypal is clearly a lucrative "business" ? What's stopping someone from using new email accounts to create various xcoins/paypal profiles, buying large sums of bitcoin, and then disputing the transaction? The person who bought from me clearly did this--he bought $350 worth of btc, disputed it a month later, and got his money back. Seems like a pretty simple and effective scam.

I thought that's what I was doing. I didn't even know paypal was reversible :(. So They just allow you to get scammed like this? Someone can just say "oh yeah, oops, i didn't mean to authorize that" and they'll get to keep the bitcoin AND get cash back from me!? Wtf kind of wonky-ass scammer's dream is that?

Why? I've used paypal a few times, mostly for these types of transactions. I've never had this happen before. If this is so standard, and I'm such an idiot for falling for it, how is paypal even still around? Are you suggesting that they just allow or even encourage scamming of their customers?

Ah, no worries. I appreciate your smartening me up. I really had no idea they were like this. I mean---my mom uses paypal to buy quilting materials online. Lesson learned, though. I just wish there was some kind of recourse, legal or otherwise. 
I'm pretty pissed off. I mean, they told me to send them the digital transaction that showed the BTC had been delivered to the buyer. I did. They told me in chat and on the phone that I was all good and they'd help me, and things would be fine. Then the next day I get an email from them basically saying "lol oops sorry, your money is gone."

Nope, I had no idea. I'd only ever used paypal for the purpose in the OP and less than 10 times total. I guess I should have known better. Thanks for smartening me up. I'm going to try to talk to support again and support at xcoins, but I'm considering my money lost at this point&gt;

I've done this multiple times in the past without any issue. Like 10x times. I thought paypal was a reputable business? The only reason I'm involved in selling bitcoin at all is because its' the only way to receive cashouts from online poker sites. 
Edit: How would you suggest I sell my bitcoin instead? I thought this was the simplest way. Sites like Coinbase where I could go straight from bitcoin to cash and send it to my bank wouldn't allow the transactions because they came from gaming sites.

No worries, thanks anyway.

That's what I figured. Thanks. Right now, my paypal account is showing a negative balance. Will they automatically deduct this amount from my linked bank account, or will they be patient and wait for me to pay it off?
