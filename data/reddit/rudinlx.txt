Wouldn't formal charges with more clients be more effective?

Anyone with API access can post updates if it's still working? No website info, Twitter or Facebook updates. Thanks.

The thing is: an announcement would have gone a long way.

It's perfectly legit. It's much easier to incorporate in the UK using a secretarial firm to handle accounting and correspondence. I have a Ltd in Britain as well, despite not living or working there. That's the best thing about the EU.

Regulations will kill bitcoin or any cypher currency. As they did with, well, liberty.

This is one of the reasons I dislike halting a market, like MtGox did yesterday. I'm not saying they did it for dishonest reasons at all. What I'm saying is that it doesn't help in building confidence. 
Perhaps infrastructure problems with exchanges also help creating bigger crashes in a panic loop.
Bitcoin credit with trustworthy arbitrage can generate great margins.

You're right too, of course. But it's frustrating - at the very least - for the users. A small note - like what's been released during the afternoon - it's a huge confidence boost. I really wouldn't want to be in his shoes. It's a can of worms. Personally, no complains here if my balance is unchanged (but I had no pending sell/buy orders).

I do hope they're just fixing it. Hopefully people will get their BTC and euros back. Otherwise, I see some lawsuits coming on.

Unpredictable behavior is part of the game. Most people saying that the bubble would pop wouldn't really know when (150€? 200€? 4000€?). My opinion is that it rose too quickly in a hyper bubble movement (it's the Internet, much faster than traditional markets) and popped too soon. I think it will now grow at a slower pace and will surpass the last maximum value before bubbling again.
