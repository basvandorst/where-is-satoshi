Should probably do half IMO. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:42:05
Yeah, not because of bitcoin decline- it dropped because I lost money with BCH.

all jokes aside OP- take this as a lesson to not trust people so easily over the internet. I once bought a runescape account (lvl110) over paypal and levelled up, made money on it etc. One day, the original owner used password recovery to take the account back. Moral of the story is all good lessons are learnt from childhood playing runescape or, Bitcoin.
