Yep. 
It actually that the Bitcoin Logo is facing downwards and the Bitcoin Cash Logo is facing upwards.

There's no logic in having paper money that is backed by bitcoin.

The first country that applies to your prediction on the list you linked through Twitter, Haiti, has an average salary of ~$5 at 8 hours/day. that's $0.625 an hour.
The second country in the list you linked to through Twitter, Rwanda, has a median hourly income of ~$0.5.
The current average Bitcoin transaction fee is $1.5.
This means an Haitian would have to work an additional 2.4 hours and a Rwandian would have to work for an additional 3 hours just so they could afford a single transaction fees. 
in fact, since we all know how humane employers are, especially at these countries, i'd say that these workers would have to work those additional hours a week/month (depends on their wage system) to compensate for the transaction fees from their employers on top of the added hours needed for the transactions fees for their purchases.
Even if bitcoin manages to reduce its fees by a factor of ten and not appreciate in value (and hence, raise its transaction fees), it would not be a viable currency for a poor country.

1. the original post predicted using Bitcoin as a national currency, not as a national reserve.
2. There is zero economic reason for a country to use Bitcoin as a reserve.

So who owns this address and why all the funds from the various btce addresses were sent to this address?
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:17:09
They are moving funds. they started with a 65K BTC accounts and are shuffling it through hundreds of addresses, every 10 minutes or so they move 20 BTC to 5 different addresses and the rest to a single address, rinse and repeat. they are now at 53K BTC.
This is their first address
This is their currently last used address
This is a clear sign of trying to shuffle the funds and hide a trail. i don't they are going to return anything back.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:39:07
No. it was fed by funds from the addresses in the known BTC-E addresses and its fund movements indicate it's someone who wants to complicate tracking its trail as much as possible.

No, Apple is where it is right now because it is/was an innovative company. Nokia stopped being an innovative company and so Apple surpassed it somewhere in 2007.
Apple had really bad years before they got a sense to bring Jobs back to restructure it and come up with new products like the ipod and later on the iphone.
Bitcoin served the entire Cryptocurrency industry by "mainstreaming" the concept of an entirely virtual currency not backed by a state. it shown the world the advantage in Cryptocurrency, but it doesn't mean that the brand bitcoin is enough to carry it forward without a substantial advantage.

You've got the address wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:33:39
Those who still has faith in BTC-e, check this out:
First they emptied their BTC into this address
After shifting through around 20 addresses, this is the current final destination:
$13M already got shuffled through around a hundred addresses. i am willing to bet it wont end at ~60K BTC and would continue to be shuffled until the initial amount completely dissolves.
This is not the Feds doing, obviously.

I also don't get it.
How did a bitcoin exchange in Russia got so popular by people who are not russians?
That's almost as bad as sending your BTC to a Nigerian exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:38:52
Lol, sad but true :D
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:30:02
No it's not. 
The funds move in a systematic method to try and complicate tracing its trail.
The first address i posted got its funds from the addresses on the entire list of known BTC-E addresses.

Noob question. If both manage to retain the exact same value, does that mean people will double their bitcoins?
