Gonna have to read more about it, I am not a huge follower.

LOL, name is deceiving, I own a little ETH but mostly I own ETC, name still works but it would be a lot longer if I had to put EtherClassicMinded. :)
Yes I have issues with immutability in crypto as well.

Cool cool

thank you!  I was fairly confident this is what you were referencing, makes complete sense.

nah ETH has a blockchain, ADA is in development, meaning it is theoretical, most theoretical technologies don't carry such a huge price tag until a beta or alpha is released.  ADA is a shitcoin, not because it's not brilliant or because the engineers are not good, but because it's valuation does not track with reality.

toilet paper?

You do understand it was a joke right?  You seem very upset, do you want me to wipe away the cry crys?
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:52:54
boooo there is good tech coming out all the time in the space.  Try not being so tribalistic.  I love bitcoin and most of my networth is in bitcoin, but there are a lot of really good altcoins out there.  A lot of super amazing technology that is being developed.  Poop poop on you.

I am sensitive or why would I take offense to an internet person telling me how to... type...

That is often indirect financial stake, when your networth drops over night by 40% because your government does some stupid shit, you get an immediate backlash.  The threat of higher internet fees is not something that is hitting you in that second.  Also net neutrality has had a big backlash, 80% of people want it changed.

Can you send me information on Geolocated?  From what I understand IP address is not attached to the transaction, short of controlling most nodes or having a clever system I am not sure who you geolocate. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:07:36
I love people telling me what to do and how to talk.  SHITCOIN SHITCOIN SHITCOIN SHITCOIN, does that hurt your feelings?  Need another hypoallergenic tissue to wipe them salty cry crys?

Crying that they sold like punks at $10k. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:31:33
literally said I was joking, now stop crying and get back to work!!!

A controlled decent, while much less effective in the long run, allows for the appearance of control, which often curbs knee jerk reactionary runs on banks.  I would not have done it but I completely understand why it would appear to be the right call at the time.  The market can recover from anything so long as confidence in the people, who report to run it, are able to control it.    Also remember that EVERYONE has a part in an economy so what is bad for some is bad for more than just those "some" down the line... This is why we have bitcoin, confidence in a resilient open system allows the economy to take intention out of the equation.

who is they?  Also seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what bitcoin and decentralization is... If "they" could stop me from making a crypto, then why can't "they" stop bitcoin.  
How about we all take personal responsibility rather than laying the blame on the pretty forest mushroom.  Yea its pretty but you did not research to see if it was poison, if you eat it the end result is fully on your shoulders.

As an American that has been sued twice I can say this is true.  That said has not unmasked as American, but I have also not read their comment history... Could just be a busy body.

I like gold as well, but you are gonna have a hard time selling it.  The cash for gold places pay around 75% on the dollar per oz.  So if spot were $1000 they will give you $750... meaning the price of gold needs to go up by 25% just to store your wealth.  
Also yes the executive order is not enforced, honestly it might not be active but they point is that the government has president to reenact this EO and come to your house and take your gold, with force.  So yes gold is great but when you need it the government will as well and they will give you collapsing dollars for your gold... 
I like gold, I own gold, but I also realize that it might just be pretty bars to stare at rather than a real store of value.
Let's not talk about gold certs.

I use Polo heavily, have withdrawn thousands of dollars, have never had this issue.  A part of me wonders if you are having some user issues, like inputting wrong addresses, not confirming transactions in your email, something a long those line.

Interesting that it is missing bitcoin cash... Bigger blocks seem inevitable to me, once we hit a much larger scale, but I agree that at this point its to early to consider. That said bitcoin cash is a legit crypto, even though I don't own any... I prefer real bitcoin. :)

lol Earn.com is sooo dumb, any company that thinks that is worth $100 Million deserves the massive losses they are bound to take from this acquisition.
