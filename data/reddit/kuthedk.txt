Yes exactly this, for many people investment into crypto is a form of gambling and they confuse it with solid and logical investment. The best way to mitigate your losses is to do exactly as we both described.

Ok so as someone who has made a lot off crypto myself. Take your initial investment plus 10-20% of what you have in crypto if having that much money will either A) change your life by having that much or B) pay off any outstanding debts you have. If A &amp; B don’t really apply, at least take out your original investment so you literally have nothing to lose that you didn’t already have.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:20:02
So you don’t lose what you already had. You have basically funny money at that point that if you need to use it you can when you want to, but if it crashes to 0 then you didn’t lose what you already had.

Well it’s time to switch my accounts over to my local CU.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:05:41
Look I’m all for HODLing, I’m just saying if it will help you out now take 10-20% of your total assets and your initial investment. If by doing that somehow wipes out all of your investment then you’re already losing money and should have sold a while ago or you’re taking yourself out too early. But if you follow this advice your 10-20% still leaves you with 90-80% left in crypto minus a percentage point or two for your initial investment.

Some people have mortgages or some other type of outstanding debt that they can afford to put some money into crypto and if they lost it it wouldn’t ruin them or make keeping food on the table and a roof over their head difficult. As for the part about part A, some people have seen incredible gains that only touching 10-20% of their crypto principle could make someone life altering money. I don’t think you should ever shame someone out of investing their money how they want to unless it literally will hurt them by doing so. You cannot generalize everyone where those two situations could apply into people that don’t have the money to invest.

As great as LN is going to be, we still need mass adoption of segwit that a majority of exchanges have yet to make for piss poor reason as to why they haven’t too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:36:45
because it mentioned Bcash in it
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:04:02
lightning? is that an actual term? sorry please forgive my ignorance I used to be involved in BTC a while back and sold but now I'm gaining interest in it and some other coins/tokens and my goodness has it changed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:37:39
Yeah I’m having problems with it and same for my friend in another state... looks to be having a lot of problems right now... hope our wallets are ok.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:48:59
yeah I moved some of my recent gains over to an exchange to start investing into another crypto I feel is going to take off in a year or two. 8 hours later and its still 0/3 confirmations... wth is up with bitcoin being so slow lately?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:12:09
thanks, m8, any way to see what the sats are that are clearing in any easy fashion? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:44:08
I'm glad you enjoy the social services you have such as a police force &amp; fire department and depending on where you live, hospitals too.
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:02:14
no fucking way do I want the government involved with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:30:40
Well not quite sure what this exactly has to do with bitcoin but I actually support this move by the banks, and not too often do I say that.
@_date: 2014-06-09 06:56:35
No in fact I doubt that my router can handle that but the entire network of P2Pool nodes will still go on even if you or anyone else were to attack my one node that I host.
@_date: 2014-06-09 04:08:16
I've just recently set up a P2Pool node that I personally host, and only am taking .25% fee to help cover the cost of operating it, here is a link to the post about it: [DDoS protected P2Pool ONLY .25% Fee](
@_date: 2014-06-09 05:53:09
TL;DR Dont do it, Join a P2Pool Node such as one I have set up: [P2Pool node Info](
I used to think that reinvesting my BTC into GHS was a good idea, then i did some research after already investing into about 32GHS. It turned out that although they say they only take .26USD for 1GHS a month, I and many others were finding that they were taking up to ~33%+ of my BTC that were found with the GHS that I had. After I realized this, I quickly cashed out all of my GHS for BTC and sent them back to my wallet. Well it wasn't more than a day after me doing so, there were and still are many post about gnash.io rapidly approaching the 51% attack mark and having done nothing to try and prevent that or show that they are trying to keep mining decentralized. so after finding all of that information I decided to set up my own mining pool; but then I got to thinking it would be better to have a decentralized mining pool where there is very low to no chance of a 51% attack on the BTC Network. So what I did was set up a P2Pool node and information about the node I set up is in the TL:DR section at the top of this post. Hope this helped you make a decision on what you wanted to do. :)

yea, I think their multi Billion dollar company can take you and any others who try to press a lawsuit agains them.
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:25:59
what, where do u get your info on peoples age? but thanks for thinking I'm younger than i really am.
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:01:12
I'm not quite to sure but at this point I think that there is at least enough GH/s on the pool node that you would still be able to make some BTC but only proportionally to the amount of work (hash rate) you put in. If any one else knows better about this please chime in at any time, Thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-14 06:49:49
thank you thank you thank you thank you! I was wondering how to describe the value of bitcoin to my family and to some friends and now ill just show them this!
@_date: 2014-06-10 03:56:50
Also I've just looked into nicehash.com, and to be honest it is a bit confusing and has a steep learning curve to it if you want to use it properly especially if you are a new miner or someone who wants to invest into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 03:15:22
well the same could be said about any cloud mining service and or pool.
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:27:00
thank you for pointing out something that I already understand, and have admitted.
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:49:52
well just sent them an email asking to prove that they are what they claim. Hopefully they reply with proof.
@_date: 2014-06-09 04:46:19
thank you for your tip :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:19:23
feel free to set up your own p2pool node, once you do that and mostly pay for everything out of your own pocket then get back with me and lets have a talk about commitment.
@_date: 2014-06-10 21:13:47
What ever, your not even worth my time anymore so bye and have a good life :)
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:18:31
there isn't one p2pool FYI and yes this is a p2pool not a regular pool.
@_date: 2014-06-09 06:42:57
quite frankly I don't have a DDoS protection provider, however because of the nature of the P2Pool network, It its self is protected from DDoS.
@_date: 2014-06-09 07:42:00
Here is a list of public nodes  you better get started ;) also not one single person owns or host all of the nodes on the pool
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:32:58
not really, I just decided to take off cloud flare because I didn't feel like paying the $200 fee of ddos mitigation, also their free version docent protect against ddos so I just switched the name servers back to what there originally were.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:30:24
I know its roughly about $17Mill but its almost too good to be true, especially the 200k buy in to bid.
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:57:03
Its all based on the luck of the p2pool network Again someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2014-06-09 02:23:14
just wanted to thank you for your up vote, I'm glad you also support the people against mining centralization
@_date: 2014-12-17 06:24:55
this scares the hell out of me... at least it was only $70 that i threw into this big scam... and why the heck did the coin-swap.com stop trading XPY all of a sudden... this is all adding up to be such a scam that I hope to god that this is the worse it gets... and really they are not helping anyone but themselves with this and its like a bernie madoff scam. oh yea we will buy your XPY for $20 but no where in the TOS does it ever claim that and also it even goes to say that XPY can have a value of $0. Yea I as an investor understand that I can lose what I invested but this is getting crazy.
@_date: 2014-12-17 07:26:09
last I checked they weren't creating anymore XPY wallets on their website
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:08:13
Yes due to the nature of bitcoin and the way it works, its necessary to mine, and to mine on a decentralized network of pools.
EDIT: i just recently read and it didn't occur to me at the time of this post but you can help by setting up a p2pool node and have miners connect to that node even if you don't personally mine for coins.
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:38:55
I deleted the pool and the post because as much as a wave it made on here it just didn't feel like doing it anymore, but people should still mine on a p2pool network to help fight mining centralization
@_date: 2014-06-09 06:24:38
Yes even if you throw a DDoS attack at a single node or even multiple nodes its rather impossible to bring down the entire network of mining nodes.

And with coinbase (conbase) having their most recent fuck up of making anywhere between 2-50+ unauthorized charges putting users tens of thousands into debt, were probably set to see a dip that hasn’t been seen since the 2013 bubble.
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:24:20
even with them making several unauthorized charges to their users, anywhere between 3-50x transactions, putting their users tens of thousands into debt, and then blaming it on Visa (when Visa made an official statement saying that they have made no such error or change to how they process their transactions)?
