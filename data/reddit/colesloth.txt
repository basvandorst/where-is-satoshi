So far, no good. I'm currently synchronizing my newly installed BC Core. After that I'll try to figure out how to import my old wallet.dat to it.

Thanks. I'm going to try it on a different computer today. Otherwise I'll try this on my laptop when I get back at work in 2 days.

Thanks. Looks like I'll be trying to set up python. Also posted in the help foyum you linked. I'll shoot you a message if I ever get the wallet opened.

Bitcoin was created late 2008, according to the wiki. It's now late 2015.  I think my math is pretty close.

It may be unencrypted then, but I still don't have a way figured out to actually open the file and view my coins.

Is this going to try and rescan as in re-download the over 20 GB worth of file space?

I get an error when I try to simply move that wallet into replace the wallet.dat in the bitcoins folder. Is there a correct way to import the wallet?

Thanks. It's an old laptop, but still powerful. It's actually the one I used to mine the coins to begin with. I just upgraded the hard drive years back and saved the wallet.dat before I wiped it all. I'll get to try and transfer the wallet when I get back to it in a few more hours. I hope it works.

I'll give it a try once it's done with its initial install. I'm on an old laptop and it's a year and 47 weeks behind with it.

If I try to swap my wallet.dat out with the one I have using this program, it hangs when I start the program back up when it says verifying wallet. Is there a proper way to try and import it?

All that's visible in the popup box is a red x and an ok button to click. It looks like there's more that's cut off, but it's like the window is the wrong size.

Also, could I have a wallet.dat file from a mining program that I can't just put in by core? I do remember mining coins but never spent any.

I haven't figured out how to even try and access the file to see if there's a PW or make an attempt at guessing it/brute force.
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:38:54
I tried to just close the program out, replace the wallet.dat file with my old one, and open the program back up. didnt work.

guess it was later than I thought. May 2011

Forgot to ask. I don't get far enough into reopening bit core after swapping out wallets for a --rescan as soon as I open the bit core exe the error pops up and force closes.  Is there a different way to get to rescan without opening the exe?

I'm just saying a year isn't going to make much difference either way.

In notepad, it's all in kanji or something. I can't read Chinese :(

A little click ok screen pops up with a red x. It looks like the size of the window is off.
@_date: 2015-12-13 13:23:49
Thanks. I'll mess with it some more today.
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:13:05
When I try putting my old wallet.dat file in place of the newly installed wallet.dat I get an error box that just has a red x in it and an OK button to click. No error message or anything.
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:21:21
OK.
