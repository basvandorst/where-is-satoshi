Because storing all your money in cash long-term is a great idea. What could go wrong?

There aren't any non-risky options out there for Greeks. Bitcoin's been relatively stable for the past 3 months and if stored correctly, the risk of theft is zero. To me that's much better than storing thousands of Euros under the mattress and hoping that thieves won't find it or the house won't burn down.

It's the same as the US budget debate. Both sides are playing hardball but in the end a compromise agreement will be made in the last minute. And the same process is repeated in a few months when Greece has again run out of money, over and over again.

All people are afraid of things they don't understand. Bitcoin represents change, and change means uncertainty. Those who are well-off today see bitcoin as a risk to their well-being because it might so they'd rather it didn't exist.
  
Many people spend their entire life earning and saving money. And all of a sudden, along comes a technology that might undermine everything they worked so hard to gain. They don't want to risk that.
  
Another thing is that they feel like they missed the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rich quick when they didn't buy thousands of bitcoins for pennies. That hurts their pride. But if bitcoin were to fail, they could pat themselves on the back for not getting involved.

There's tons of niche content that isn't available either to buy nor download. I'd gladly pay for it.

This is amazing. With this, theoretically I no longer need a bank account at all (I pay my rent and utilities in cash). However those fees are a bit much, hope they reconsider them in the future.

Stop being a smartass and go do something productive.

Because I didn't know such a thing existed. Thanks for mentioning it, have to compare them for a bit.

If you too the time to read my first post then you'd know that I already checked the fees.

My bank account is on my cold storage bitcoin wallet. Bitstamp is just a gateway to change bitcoin into Euros.

Because we need to raise awareness first so that everybody knows what's happening. Bitcoin is a billion dollar industry and you don't just do things on a whim because you're impatient and just feel like it.
  
We need to agree on a date that's at least 6 months from now so that everybody has time to learn about it and prepare for it. Otherwise we get mass panic from all the regular people wondering what and why is happening.

Most (what we consider) poor countries have faster Internet with no limits than United States. Those who can't afford broadband aren't able to download the blockchain as it is already - they wouldn't be running nodes either way. But they can still use online wallets.

Only for the amount I want to spend, and it *should* take about one hour (six confirmations) to add more to it.

Yes. I don't know about bitcoin but for example Google Play is full of apps from well-known developers with millions of users where they obviously just put the English description through google translate and called it a day. It always reads like a letter from a Nigerian Prince and I always have to triple-check if such a sloppy effort is actually the app I was looking for, or a scam.

Digital currencies are a thing for the future, not the past. People who don't know how to use computers securely most certainly shouldn't use bitcoin because they're most likely to have them stolen or lost, which is sad and enforces the idea that bitcoin is a scam currency.
  
It's not really a problem. Every year, there are more young adults out there who have grown up with computers and who know how to install antivirus and backup files. Bitcoin is at least 10 years away from mainstream adoption, if it'll ever happen.
  
If these people still want to use bitcoin, they should hold no more than what they're willing to lose (for most people I imagine that's less than $100), until they've proven to themselves that they can keep their money safe.
