Its a double edged sword, if OP did claim investment losses his wife's lawyer can claim the money back if it was money that came from a joint account and she didn't agree to investing in bitcoin. Same way you can sue your investment broker if they put you in products you didn't agree to and you end up losing money.

One of the major weaknesses I see in convincing that crowd is that bitcoin just like government issued fiat needs a support system to survive and for you to make transactions. For those who thinking the whole financial system itself is going to collapse, and look to move assets out of it, why would they put their trust in another fiat currency less than a decade old versus putting in precious metals that have centuries long track record of preserving value.

You do need to advertise if its a product most people still don't know much about. Apple wasn't the first company to come out with an mp3 player but they were the first to really promote it.

The main question will be do mainstream precious metal investors see it as an equivalent of gold and silver ? Im not sure it will be easy to get people oriented towards tangible, physical assets to jump into an electronic based currency.

You cant encourage people to adopt when such a thing does not exist yet and does not seem to be anywhere on the horizon.   


 
Why would consumers want to pay for the same protection they are currently getting for free with credit cards/paypal


The fee (interest on balance) is transparent to the user. To them it is free as they aren't being asked to pay anything. Where I live pretty much no one actually pays any monthly fees for a personal bank account. Some banks will even give you money to open a new account with them. 


   
Its not about mistyping. It could be picking the wrong address on your saved list to send it to.


  
At least where I live for online transactions they can be be easily reversed if the reversal request is made on the same business day, with the chances reducing the longer you wait.  The only transaction that is impossible to reverse is if you made out a cheque or bank draft for the wrong amount or person, gave it to them and they already deposited it before you figured it out. A lot of things have to go wrong for that to happen though.

There are very few FIAT currencies in history that have lost 60% of their value vs other currencies in just one month short of a war or natural disaster.  BTC has done this plenty of times in its very short life. 


It shows you haven't really travelled much, why would a Kenyan  tomato vendor on the side of the road be more willing to accept bitcoin vs cash or mobile phone credits which have cheaper fees+faster txt times+and are easily convertible to cash at mobile phone outlets (North America is actually very behind the rest of the world in this regard)

Its also took billions of investment by companies in physical/network infrastructure and logistics to make that happen. Bitcoin has no where near the same amount of money coming in to actually spread its adoption and make things easier as everyone is more interested in price (Which is why the narrative has shifted from its an internet currency to its a store of value). Even a joke memecoin like Doge is a better functioning currency than BTC at the moment (way less fees and much faster confirmation times) lots of people use that now to move money between exchanges.

If you are moving out of regular tourist areas, you need local currency. people are wary of accepting money from a stranger carrying foreign money if they aren't familiar with it as it could be easily be fake.
Same deal with when I travel to the US, if I go to Buffalo a lot of stores will accept Canadian dollars since its close to the border and they are used to lots of Canadians coming to shop and are trained to identify counterfeit bills. If I went down to New York City they wouldn't accept it and tell me to get USD

The internet sales went up when it became easier and cheaper than shopping in person. Email took off when it was easy to send and receive than mail. In terms of usage as a currency Bitcoin has actually gone backwards in terms of using it to buy goods and services because of its scaling issues and darknet buyers have switched over to more private currencies for their purchases. People only buy it as a speculative investment.

Cyrpto needs to be easier to use than other forms of currency to gain traction. People aren't going shift to something that is slower+more cumbersome+more expensive to do their everyday transactions. So far the only venue it wins vs FIAT is buying drugs online because it is harder to trace (though not entirely impossible)

Paypal is easier though and will fill in your address info (unless you want to change it to something else).
Plus as a customer you have the ability to dispute charges if what you get isn't as advertised (happened to me 2 times). With bitcoin I have will have to rely on the benevolence of the seller to get my money back.

A lot of it is to protect consumers. They have to make sure that even if you go bankrupt or are some kind of scammer and you disappear with your customers money, they will still get some sort protection.

With the way you write about the CIA, they have much bigger fish to fry than to manipulate a subreddit of 85000 people centered around a currency that has a trading volume only larger than that of a few African currencies.
