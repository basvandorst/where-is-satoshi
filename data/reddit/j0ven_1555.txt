It's worse.  All the 'others' out there started with Coinbase from the beginning.  eGifter is someone who was doing it right then quit to go to Coinbase.  Just take Overstock for example, quick look on their website reads, "You can now buy thousands of Overstock.com products with Bitcoins! We've partnered with Coinbase to become the first major retailer to accept the digital currency. So shop away!"

Wait im confused, this is the same guy that forced all users to take a 30% haircut on their balance?  Doesnt seem like cb users are very much in control.

I had 4 BTC about 4 months ago, then I bought some stuff with it, now just sitting with a .75 BTC too frustrated to look at the updates everyday but couldn't help when I saw ~975 wow.

Mycelium swish worked like a charm for the first 36 hours they opened last week.  All the other sites are painful to use.

Originally they had up .1 BTC increments which I used but I had to email support b/c of an issue and they said they are getting very high volume &amp; it's their first day w/ a lot of manual processes so I'm guessing they took those down for now to catch up.

Hi- I'm currently using Mycelium but recently I have a strong need to find an alternative wallet to use on Android.  Since Mycelium has the best reputation for Android I wasn't sure what other products are reputable until I saw this post.  Is there anything different from your product than Mycelium?
One concern I have about Mycelium as well is their addition of swish allowing the purchase of BTC by credit card.  While it's a fantastic feature since Circle is gone, it's unclear to me the connection between Mycelium team and swish team and whether my wallet could be compromised by the same scrutiny that exchanges use.  Before swish I always felt like Mycelium was nicely separated from all the exchange red tape.
If you can give me a solid answer I plan on downloading the BitPay app today and moving some funds there for storage.

an app that stores all the available places to buy in which countries and the fastest way to get it.  showing each exchanges price would be a major plus.
otherwise some type of news/rss place to read stories.

mycelium used to be my intermediary between exchange and websites.  if i am buying from swish onto mycelium do i need another wallet to use as an intermediary?
any suggestions for android if so?  i really like just having a single mycelium wallet but if i have to create a 2nd one to be safe so be it.

Uhh you must not remember all their users taking a 33% haircut due to bullshit?  Or was that someone else?
