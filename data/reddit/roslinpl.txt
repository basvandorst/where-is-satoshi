Welk if you are unity3d expert you can get a source from it on your own. As for now I am not sharing source with community - this project is done with unity3d and unity projects aren't open source in most of the cases. 
I will provide all the source when I will finish. 
I don't want someone to just take it and build their own embassy.

Thanks a lot!
Come and see 1st Bitcoin Space Shooter :) 
Visit Embassy and find "space craft" 3d model on a desk to play a game :)
Or you can download a windows/linux/mac version - links are posted here : 
Kind regards!

I agree - I released standalone version for Linux users mostly - many of them complain that they cannot run Bitcoin Online Embassy as it needs Unity Web Player which isn't easy to install when you have Linux.
I am thinking that web version is most important and I need to improve it while thinking of it as of a web project.
On other hand - Embassy is created with Unity3D - when Unity5 will be released (probably this year) it will provide conversion into webGL - so when Unity5 will be released NO Unity Web Player will be needed to visit the Embassy - just a simple web browser without any plugins - so then standalone version will be no more needed - but I will provide possibility to download standalone version too - as someone might want to improve a video quality which is higher in the standalone version :)
Thanks for your response.
Kind regards.

It all depends on what you like to play. So far I am receiving e-mails with congrats for creating this good tiny game :)
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:17:36
Some say it is pretty good :) If you don't like space shooters don't play it - and this is alpha v1.0.0 :) so many updates will come :)... seems like you aren't Tyrian fan...
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:39:53
Well you can always check on  your own :D hehe. 
You can play WEB version if you don't want a package ...
AND ALSO when you download win/mac/linux distr after downloading you don't need Internet connection so you can play it OFFLINE ... 
Answer to your question : NONE.
@_date: 2014-07-25 10:44:48
If you want to download standalone version of Bitcoin online Embassy - use ONLY links which are placed on our main page! Or links from Bitcointalk.org Embassy's Official Thread - do not use any other links provided by any other users. Thanks!

Please quote me and show me where did I told that "no one is generous enough?".
I just say that it is worth consider why only 5 people shows their support with doing anything? A 5 from hundreds of thousands!
Thanks to Dave00, Edd, BitcoinLady, KingsCrown, Yankee, and all of those who support with their ideas and kind words!!!!
And why most of the Bitcoiners even didn't visit my Embassy cause they think it is a "SCAM!" :D
This is a problem which wasn't here with us years ago.
Every small Bitcoin project was visited by almost every Bitcoiner. 
It is different now.
It is not only about mine project, it is about projects around which are dying because of lack of interest from the community.
This is not how it was before. And this is why it will be hard to see another rally.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:52:44
   
This project need Unity Web Player indeed.
I can send you desktop version for linux so you will be able to install. PM me on reddit I will send you a link.
When full version will be released there will be a version for Windows/iOS/Android/Mac/Linux/etc. (even PS3 or X-Box360 or Wii)     as Unity3D provide multiplatforming.
@_date: 2014-07-05 22:45:41
Thanks for your response :)
At the moment there is no possibility to buy real Bitcoins in our Embassy - our Bitcoin Machines are placed for people to let them see on their own how those machines works and how easy is to buy Bitcoins with them :)
In the future there is possibility that we will integrate some Bitcoin Exchange with the Embassy and you will be able to buy real Bitcoins but this is only a plan and this isn't yet sure is it going to happen or no - but it is highly possible that one day it will be possible :)
For now enjoy to use virtual Bitcoin Machines in our Embassy :)
Kind regards!
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:07:45
nope ... 
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:41:08
Are you serious? :)
You are collecting bitcoins that are flying by ... well it is related and many people already love this game :) hehe.
Have you played it? Cause I know at least already two people addicted :) this game is really good - but you need to play it instead of trolling :)
@_date: 2014-05-18 10:34:06
from a few days I am working on a 1st "Bitcoin Online Embassy". In the future it can replace BTC Foundation.
So many features are possible to create there ... 
visit test version: official thread 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:12:45
why you think so?
@_date: 2014-07-06 09:37:00
I keep images at host56. Embassy isn't placed there if you want to know. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:36:51
No :) I was answering this question yesterday already:
This is Bitcoin Online Embassy - you don't need to install any heavy games to run it.
Just Unity Web Player or standalone version of the Embassy.
Check out the link that I post above - there are infos about downloads too.
Thanks for your response.
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:30:31
Thanks for your response. 
I am still trying to explain that my meaning wasn't that only one person donated my project.  I don't expect donations but I expect support.  Which only few of the hundreds of thousands gave me. 
Anyway.  Like I told before this isn't only about my projects but about others too. 
I knew that for some of the readers it will looks like my moaning and crying but that wasn't my point. 
I only shows some numbers which are very low.  A number of supporters/visitors.
Well ... perhaps I need to work harder And tthink smarter. 
Regards. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:48:52
No prob. I can send you a link to standalone linux app version of our Embassy just let me know do you want to see it :)
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:30:08
No it is not Second Life.  This is "Bitcoin Online Embassy" - a project created in Unity3D engine which provide a virtual place for Bitcoiners to share knowledge about Bitcoin (for newbies and not only) and support Bitcoin in many ways. Check Embassy's official Bitcointalk.org thread: 
@_date: 2014-06-22 22:42:17
Warning? what does it mean for you?
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:12:57
Good luck and you are not crazy. :-) 
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:55:11
try to make something like our Embassy in webGL - good luck to you. :)
I know that webGL is great language but as for now I choose Unity4 (and soon Unity5 - when it will be released) -  I am a founder and I know that Unity3D is great engine and it provide multiplatform development  as well in a same time. So just by clicking I can make /mac/linux/windows/android/even PS3 or X-Box360 or Wii aplication.
I love to work on Unity3D and this Embassy will stay in Unity3D.
If someone in the future will be able to convert it into webGL - please do it - I guess he will need a 40 people team or few years of free time ;) webGL isn't such powerful tool to develop 3d interactive words.
Unity3D is a combine-harvester with thousand of possibilities.
@_date: 2014-07-06 09:46:46
It is made in Unity3d - It is not open source project for now. It will be open source in the future as for now only scripting that is done is simple Javascript in unity so open source is not needed as people first will need to learn how to code unity and then I can share my scripts. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:45:41
There is a standalone version of the Embassy to download just on the main page :-)
You don't need unity Web player for a standalone version. 
You can download it and run on your operating system (windows/Linux/os x).
So you can just download,  unpack and run with no Web Player needed or any other installations.
I will redesign main page so it will be easier to understand :-)
Thanks for suggestions! (I will also add YouTube video).
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:42:32
You are misunderstanding my topic.
I am not asking you about donation in my topic. And one generous Bitcoiner gave me enough to make Bitcoin Online Embassy alive.
If you will read more carefully you will understand what I am telling about.
PS. I know that the Embassy is great project as some great Bitcoiners told me that in their opinion it is great.
I will work on the Embassy without any more donations just slower that I was wanting to. It doesn't matter - I created 1st Bitcoin Online Embassy and I am DAMN PROUD of it. 
This is not what was my thread about. Read it again and open your eyes.

Hey! Now you don't need Unity Web Player to check for latest news from Bitcoin Online Embassy! 
Visit us and check brand new home page @      You will find newest version to download over there or you will be able to visit Embassy with Unity Web Player like it was till now.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:26:49
Thanks for your response! I understand your point of view - but imagine that Bitcoin will be used soon by youngsters :) and they will like to learn about it in 3d world instead of reading books and stuff :) And I think for them Embassy will be very nice place! :) You are 100% right about Oculus - I am working on headtracking :)
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:17:16
Well :) 
There are plenty of new updates now :)
1. Blockchain.info guide
2. News board
3. Bitcoin charts :) 
and not only :) Come and see on your own!
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:50:36
My negativity?  You're misunderstanding the meaning of my post.
Anyway thanks for the suggestion but I will not provide all the source code as I am using a 3D well known engine to build it. 
I can provide my scripts which I have done to make the Embassy work but will this change anything? Main source code is a 3d engine which I cannot share.
Regards.
