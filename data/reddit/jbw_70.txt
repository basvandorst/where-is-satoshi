I am not going here anymore. There are so many threads about this here on Reddit and Twitter every day. I will say this, nothing more about LN. I am tired  of reading about opinion's, everybody has of course the right to have one, but the discussion is not going anywhere... because that is just what they are opinion's.
 This depends what problem you want to resolve. The fact is that half want's to increase the block size and the other half want's to decrease the block size. They might both be right, depending in what way they are using LN. But you can only do one of those things which mean's that LN will not solve all of the problems + it will not be a good solution for mass adoption.  This of course depend's how the masses want's to use LN. The fact is I have no clue.

This is only part of the truth. We have gotten so many new exchanges + new pairings so the need to use the snailcoin is less now if you like to buy some altcoin's. There is a less need now to first buy the snailcoin wait for that to go trough for hours just to use that to buy some altcoins. We see progress, it is about time.
@_date: 2019-03-02 07:09:09
We don't have the same situation we had then. I have read nothing about that this problem is solved and when we will some day get to the same situation then we will have the same problems again.
@_date: 2019-03-02 10:26:05


So true I suppose. Facebook only have + 1 B users left. This I suppose has the same minimum affect = close to nothing.
@_date: 2019-03-02 09:14:22
Just another article not based on facts. I think it is pretty obvious who will win at the and. A coin that all ready have a user base with more than 2.5 B users before the launch of the coin, or a snailcoin that has tried for 10 years to get mass adoption and have failed big time.
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:22:04
That could be. I have not read FB coin specs. I don't know exactly how it will work.

I is good for Bitcoin the transactions are that low, they can not handle more. We will have the same situation we had at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018.
@_date: 2019-03-01 15:40:05
All the users for Facebook, messenger,WhatsApp... are 2.7 B. They already have this many user's. It is a given when they launch the coin it is going to be massive. Bitcoin have tried for 10 years and they are no way close to mass adaption. Facebook coin is a slam dunk and Bitcoin will have even less users. Who want's to use Bitcoin after this?
@_date: 2019-03-02 18:58:36
Bitching and complaining... A bank like JP Morgan would never ever use snailcoin for anything. So I don't think it is about to choose between JPM coin and snailcoin.

That is good for him then. I just wonder why are you so concern about the rest of us. Usually no one gives a shit about anybody but I have to say BTC community is so concern about the rest of us that they give us financial advice's many many times a day. Somebody could call that brainwashing. Maybe you think that everything not having to do with Bitcoin is a scam
@_date: 2019-02-25 16:03:44
How do we see that bitcoin HAS the potential to grow. Don't you think the whales manipulated the price up on Saturday in the same way they manipulated it down on Sunday? I got news for you. The whales don't care about you and me. They care about money. For the whales it is all the same to them what the price is as long as they can make a lot of money fast
@_date: 2019-02-27 11:57:08
I think I only get the second place. LN by far will take the first price + everybody cheering for LN. 
Look here we can transfer some coin's from one wallet to another wallet it is soooooooooo fast and soooooo cheap hip hip hurey let's post this amazing news on twitter, better yet lets post it on twitter with a cool torch. Yes let's do that. It will be amazing and the whole world will start using our coin and our coin will mooon maybe even mars. Maybe they will even change gold to our Bitcoin.

For sure these bugs will eventually be solved but the truth is for now LN is not yet production ready. It is in beta version. Most of the people seem's to think otherwise, they think LN is production ready, ready for mainstream use.
Not yet, maybe some day. There are plenty of work still to be done.

Good enough for me :) But there is no such thing as free energy, not even solar power. It cost's and pollutes a lot to build. At the moment most clean power we can get is nuclear power, but we all know that it has it's own problems for now. The only way to get free energy is if we would know how to build a  cold fusion, but we don't have a clue how to do that for now.

Hmm and you are concern of the rest of us that's why you give us this useful (inside) information. It is not like you have BTC and you want that to moooon. How many BTC would you recommend us to buy?

The only similarity I see is this.
 The ‘uranium bubble’
Uranium prices bottomed at US$8 a pound in 2001. The price was far below the cost of production and there was barely a mining operation viable.
 The ‘Bitcoin bubble’
Bitcoin prices bottomed at US$1000 in 2019. The price was far below the cost of production and there was barely a mining operation viable.

I am not a grandpa but to me (I am a software developer) I think it is so hard to (time consuming) get BTC (crypto) and to use it. I have one stack of crypto (also BTC) that I sit on and wait for the price to go up. I have a another stack I use for trading not every day (at least several times a week). I don't have any crypto that I actually use for buying things, or pay anything with crypto. Why is that... because it is so difficult and time consuming to do that. Why would I have crypto on my wallet and use that for paying anything when I can do it with Euro. My salary I get in fiat / euro. Why would I first by BTC and then transfer that to my wallet to buy things when I can do it without converting anything just by using my debit / credit card. It makes no sense.  Why would I have BTC on my wallet for daily usage when I could loose 10% in one day when BTC tanks?
@_date: 2019-02-26 11:13:07
What are you suggesting here. Just hodl forever. Of course it makes sense to take the profit out once in while and buy in cheap. You of course have to know what you are doing otherwise you loose your money. But if you don't have a clue about the market then it is safer to just hodl and wait for a few years
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:53:45

 While many of the price analytics solutions do not take users’ feedback into account, [**BuySellHODL takes a different approach. It regularly approaches its active users on their opinions**]( regarding the overall state of the market. 
I am  not sure it is working correct because the Bitcoin price is going down? If 60% is thinking it will be $6600 it should go up. They should fix this bug.

If you mean by printing more fiat yes that is true. But this doesn't apply to  USA. The US CB has the right to print as much more $ they want to, and they do that. They are printing more money every day like there is no tomorrow. If Zimbabwe would do this (and they have) that will cause a inflation. We are no way close to see the US $ to collapse.

@_date: 2019-02-23 18:16:38
My point is their problem will not disappear just by changing to another currency. It is a political issue. You see they don't produce any food (or very little). Let's say they will take us $ for their new currency. They need to buy the milk from abroad. They will pay the market price (makes no different what currency they use). Still since the salary is still the same after the currency switch they still cannot afford to drink milk every day.

Let's assume your salary is now $5000 / month. Next salary you will get equal's the amount in BTC. Everything you buy you pay with BTC.

It just blow up my mind that they don't understand that if LN is not working (no one knows yet) I am not saying it will not work, but they will take this chance. Then everybody will be laughing at them (if it is not working) and it will have a HUGE affect on the Bitcoin. It goes from very bad design to a HUGE disaster. Well they put all in. Let's wait and see their card's.
@_date: 2019-02-15 15:55:32
I remember 2008. I made a lot of money 2010-2012 thanks to the collapse in 2008. It was a big collapse in the stock market but still the $ did not collapse. Why was that?. Because the Chinese once again bailed US out. Actually they are still bailing US out every single day by lending US $5 billion every day so US can pay the interest. Still the $ has not collapsed yet.

The Bitcoin whales are acting exactly in the same way the banks are that so many BTC hodlers hate. They are here to make money and to have full control. Why would they give up the 90% of Bitcoin and loose the control to manipulate the market any way they want to ? They would be stupid to. Artificial price growth... that is a given of course it is. The only thing we can be sure of. The whales and banks continue to make money that is 100% sure. We who have invested in BTC we might some day after years get some money. Of course the early BTC investors they still make money for sure even if the price comes down 50%. No need to cry and complain. If you invested in crypto be prepared to take some punches now and then for many many years to come. The fun has just begun.

That is true. At least you should not.
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:05:38
Ok I got it. That was a good example, thank you. There is a chance that since the amount of transactions on the core will be less also the fees are less then they will increase the fee. I know you already answered this. But in the beginning they might increase the fees, before they get more traffic on core. After all it is all about money :)

I am not sure I understand your question. If we continue with the Venezuela example. Could you please explain to me in what way would changing the local currency affect the normal people there. They work there. The salary will not increase because they get paid in BTC. They still have to buy food and pay the rent there. The salary is still very low. BTC will not help solve this problem. It is a political problem.
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:21:56
That is good that you are not upset with me. Idiot yes I agree I am sometimes a little slow. Thank you for the patients. One more thing. I mean you don't know how lucky you are. You don't have to wait for BTC to hit $400K like the rest of us to get rich, you just make gold out of copper. Be careful not to sell too much of the gold at once, that could make the price go down... well who am I to give you any advice, stupid me... You are clearly very smart you know all this, of course you know. I have to go now thank you for sharing your thoughts. BTW I don't even have a car so I will now go and try to buy a bus ticket using only BTC. I just read the news that you can actually do this now, this is amazing you know I can even pay my museum ticket now with BTC. This is HUGE can you imagine how fast we will moooon to $4200 now when we have all these amazing use cases. I think you can only do this with BTC... in the future as well. I am so super excited. Good times are coming, cheers. LN is suuuper fast. I just read that you can transfer BTC from wallet to wallet in 3 seconds, life is good :)

For now Chinese, Japanese... the list goes on they have no other choice but to lend US more money because US has borrowed money from everybody and still they keep on spending like there is no tomorrow + printing more money. The countries can not stop lending US because if they stop lending they will never get their money back. The $ could very well collapse some day but that day is faaaaaaaar in the future if that day will come.

Ok but with 1 confirmation you still are not sure you get the money. Did you know that not even with 6-7 confirmations can you be 100% sure you get the money, and that will take a long time (hours maybe days).

@_date: 2019-02-25 18:19:20
Of course I read the news and I have not missed the news about that development has happened. Most of the post's here I have been bitching against are the never ending price predictions and the last one was from yesterday 1BTC = $10 million, just stupid. Then these scenarios about fiat crashing + BTC is the ONLY solution. I don't believe in any of that and I think I have the right to say my opinion here. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:03:20


The BTC will not help here either. The reason for the inflation is because the companies are exiting GB. This means less work and less tax income. This also means when they import things they pay more tax + they get to export less. All this is because of brexit. BTC will not help here in any way. It makes no different what currencies they are using. They still have the same problems left. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 12:47:53
And what is your point? I don't understand when I bought my first Bitcoins has anything to do with LN not being production ready. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 13:27:54
 Why is it that it is only the BTC community trying to convince people to buy BTC? I have seen very few articles from other coins trying to convince people to buy there coins. You have these BTC price predictions from $20k to $1 million just this week. Then articles about $ + all currencies are collapsing. Dooms day is coming protect yourself by buying BTC. To me this looks / sounds very desperate. Is there something the average Joe / Jane doesn't know. Is BTC in some kind of a trouble? Why do you have to try to push people buying something they don't want to buy. What is going on...? 
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:04:13
Hi Sherlock. Easier way is to look at my karma:) Anyway I do have BTC I bought them years ago and I still have some left. I have no plans to buy more. I am not trying to piss on my own feet here. Since you make trough all the trouble and looked at my previous post if you would have read them then maybe you would have understood that I have nothing against the price going up. I am against that the price goes up with no reason at all, then it will also come down very fast like in 2018 and the market lost about $700 billion. We are still suffering from that in case you have not noticed it. If that shit will happen again (and there are so many who try it here every hour) we will be at the same shitty total $100 billion Market cap in 2021.
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:57:54
A serious answer. Never. The BTC community is only talking about price predictions. This week price prediction's $20K, $150K, $250K, and $740K. I am waiting who will go for a cool $1 millon :) Todays value is only speculative value

@_date: 2019-02-23 17:37:31
All that is true + not forget about Zimbabwe. My senses tells me that now when this has happen in Venezuela there is now way that BTC will be the next "currency" in Venezuela (pick any country you want). The reason is very simple. They cannot control BTC, truth is no government will listen to the people this way, no way hose they will give people this power that from having nothing then you will be a millionaire, when at the same time the elite will loose all the money power. I just don't buy it. If the fiat will collapse they will have many other choices than using BTC. Don't let the headlines fool you. If there are now a few thousands people in Venezuela buying BTC for $2 each/month. This will not drive BTC to $1 million.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:25:48
I find that very hard to believe. I am not saying it could not happen. It is very unlikely. Also the longer it takes the more competition BTC gets and the smaller will BTC dominance be. Here is one article from today saying it might not go as fast as the last time. [

No I don't see a problem with that. If they stop lending then it is 100% sure they get nothing back. If they continue to lend they might get something back. Yes I agree EU is not much better, but before the Euro will collapse that will take longer than the $ to collapse. EU can always kick Greece, Italy,Spain counties like that out of EU. If that will happen these countries will get their own currency back, has nothing to do with EURO. If EURO will collapse all the countries can take their own currencies back.  Like I said it is not around the corner

I think we have talked about this several time's now. It is not a slam dunk. If it would be then so many would be buying already, and most of the people are not. So it is not a slam dunk.
@_date: 2019-02-19 16:09:14
Is this not a little premature? We still have over 1 week left of this month. I think the good news from Altcoins are pushing the prices up this time. Bitcoin has not much to do with the good news now.

So what? The fiat doesn't loose 10% in it's value in 30 min 
@_date: 2019-02-23 10:52:14
Well you did not get my point completely. The question is why would I want to use BTC for daily use for buying things. I can do that with my debit / credit card without doing any extra work. Why would I put BTC on my wallet for daily use if it could go down 5-10% in just a few hours? There are only two reason's why I would use BTC for daily use. First one is if my salary is paid in BTC then I would use BTC for daily use. The second one is if there are things I would like to buy that I can only purchase with BTC. For now none of these two reasons apply. I can buy anything I want with fiat, and my salary is paid with fiat.For me why would I pay anything with BTC if I can pay it with fiat. It doesn't mean just because you can do something you should do that. I am not one of the tech guys who would use BTC for daily use just because it is possible and just to say I am one of the first doing that. No I am one of the majority who like's things to be as easy, as fast as simple as possibly.

It is called the whales are playing with us and making more money while we the small people who don't know anything are left with peanuts, look it up.
This is how we will get to 1 BTC = $1 million.
@_date: 2019-02-27 11:16:03
Of course it is working on small scale. We have the amazing torch circulating the tweet community proving that. Well if the standards are not bigger than that then I have to say it is working perfect . There is no need to continue with the development. The work is done. Next is the mars not moon, we will pass the moon with LN so easily.

Sounds good. How many BTC transactions do you have in one day?
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:26:11
My mistake. "trading against" was not the right word. You have to valuate it against something otherwise it is just plain and simple useless. So what would you valuate it against. I am not sure this is the right word either. I think you get my point.
@_date: 2019-02-15 14:01:26
Yes sharing useful information that is good and we should do that as much as we can.  But I am not convinced that sharing endless amount of information about that NOW is the right time to buy BTC is useful information. The truth is I don't know, you don't know and whoever that wrote that article (a youtube) in this case have a clue if this is the right time to buy or not. If they would know when it is the right time to buy I am sure that they also know when it is the right time to sell. Why are they not sharing this information with us? If they would know all this they would be billionaires by now. I think if you are old enough to open an exchange account , then you are able to choose what to buy and when without  the ongoing brainwashing buy BTC, buy BTC now, BTC will mooon, if you don't buy BTC now you will regret it.

@_date: 2019-02-28 13:45:29
Yes that is absolutely true. The point still is. The code is not production ready. But the news + the Twitter torch pretends it is in full production. So many new user don't know it is in beta. What is the point, what can we possible gain by trying to hide this fact. The way I see it we have more to lose than to gain.
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:26:35
Did you even bother to read what I wrote. The salary is still the same. Crypto and BTC will not do magic. Could you please now explain to me how their salary goes up by using BTC, or how their buying capacity will grow. I just don't see it, please explain. The country already get paid in US $ when they sell oil. The US $ for now is stable.
@_date: 2019-02-27 13:45:20
Who cares? We have read about this for weeks now. I think we got the point, thank you. After a year if the price of bitcoin is about the same as now we will have a lot less miners.

You should not believe in everything they tell you. Sometimes the others are wrong. Besides since you have invested in crypto be prepared to take some hits for many many years to come

ok thanks
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:54:55
The bread going up in price because of constant fiat creation. I don't see it like that. The bread is going up in price for a number of reasons. We could have a bad year because of the weather for example. The harvest was less than predicted. That will make the price go up. The machines they use cost more to produce / to buy than last year. That could be because the raw material / or oil prices / energy prices go up. The technology will only reduce the manpower cost, but you still need to invest in the technology. There could be some regulations that the cheap "poison" you were allowed to use last year for keeping the pesticides away are forbidden today. The one you can use today are more expensive....
Yes it is true the BTC don't inflate in supply, it grows every year. But it could inflate in value.  + if you read my other post's in this thread then you will come to a conclusion what I think, I hope. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 09:06:03

You are right most of us don't get it. If you are so sure Bitcoin will dominate the world maybe even universe some day. Why won't you sell your house + take a loan and go all in with Bitcoin. It would be stupid of you not to do that, since you know it is 100% sure.

 "Dong is equally shocked that he has to convince people to invest in the coin"
Why is it that it is only the BTC community trying to convince people to buy BTC? I have seen very few articles from other coins trying to convince people to buy there coins. You have these BTC price predictions from $20k to $1 million just this week. Then articles about $ + all currencies are collapsing. Dooms day is coming protect yourself by buying BTC. To me this looks / sounds very desperate. Is there something the average Joe / Jane doesn't know. Is BTC in some kind of a trouble? Why do you have to try to push people buying something they don't want to buy. What is going on...?
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:59:42
I don't know. It is not for me to decide is it? Well if you read the article + if you understood what the problems were. My question is to you. Do you think it is ready for full production?

@_date: 2019-02-20 14:20:23
Yes it is very difficult to by Bitcoin I agree with you. As long as it will remain as difficult as it is the mass adoption is very far away. You know you could try to buy some other coin. It is easier and the profit should be bigger. You could try to buy some coin that is actually trying to solve some problems, that actually has a use case instead of Bitcoin

I am using the financial system that I am comfortable with. I see no point using crypto (yet) for daily use. The only thing I use crypto for today, and most likely still after 3-5 years is trading and hodling.

Good luck to you. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 12:35:39
Exactly it is fun to play around with it, but nothing more. The news are always talking about the adoption of LN but very seldom explaining the tech is not production ready yet. Passing the torch on Twitter also, I don't get it. Why would we give an impression everything is good and ready to go when it is not. We know it is not production ready but Elon Musk + most of  the people don't know that. This could come back and bit us in the ass. Thanks to this we could still be at the same lousy price 2021 that we are today... if we are lucky.
@_date: 2019-02-13 15:31:26
Yes I agree. Why? There are so many reasons why. Just to mention a few. It is so damm difficult to buy crypto. Every week you can read there is a hack somewhere. To be honest at the moment you can not do much with crypto. You can only hold them. You can send crypto from wallet to wallet... so what.. big thing. There are no good use cases, only a few. All this has to be fixed first before we get people in masses to buy crypto. So many bad news every week. The press is writing shit to the right and left about crypto. These new investor it is difficult for them choose the right one. So much missinformation all the time
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:40:59
Do you actually think anybody here believe you
@_date: 2019-02-19 10:27:08
You are right and I think the same. Bitcoin has very few use cases. I still keep some of my BTC only because I got them very cheap and I don't need the money right now. For sure I will not buy any more. There are better coins to buy. I keep them because if I am wrong and the price will go up a lot (very unlikely) then I can still make some more money from this coin.
@_date: 2019-02-25 11:47:25
It is not a big deal not to me. But the press is making everything that happens in crypto a big deal. Ups and downs. But did you think the same last Saturday when it jumped up... this is not a big deal... or did you think yeah finally we showed all the non believers finally we have ended the 5 month of red?

Lightning Network is not ready yet. No one knows when will it be ready and how will it work. It just sounds strange to me that you rely your business on tech that is not ready for full production yet. One more time, good... ah but you don't need that, sorry. I hope you are a patient person because if you are waiting for wider adaption for LN, that could take a long time, many many years.

I see your point but what the president before the previous president did was that he gave up all of the plants and the farms. The previous president continued with that and  took it one more step further. Maduro (current president) continue with the same policy. They have no lands or farms to grow anything.Still my point is. If they would have the land and the farms to grow, the neighboring countries could by the food they don't use that would equal to that the Venezuelan currency would not be so cheap as it is. My point still is. It is about politics. Not currency. You cannot sell something you don't have even you try to sell it with crypto, BTC.

The way I see it, it makes no different how we use money, in this case reckless borrowing. We will still continue to spend more than we make (countries) no matter do we have fiat or crypto. I think there are so many other crypto that can handle large investment and volumes. You are right about that it has the longest track record, not sure if this is allgood. More reliable and stable than other cryptos, I disagree. At the moment Bitcoin of course is the most well know crypto, but that could change it is possible. It is too early to say.

That was a good article. I believe in this quote from the article.
"If it came down to it, and central banks felt a digital currency posed enough of a threat, they would happily incentivize (or mandate) usage of their own currency in order to maintain sovereign monetary policy." 
Bitcoin is not a threat. When BTC is no longer number one it will eventually fade away. Nobody will talk about it. Today's news about BTC is mostly just price predictions or convincing people to buy bitcoin, brainwashing. They write very little about any real use cases.

To be true I really don't understand to big fuzz about passing the LN torch. I mean the only thing LN can do (and only on small scale so far) is that you can actually send Bitcoin from one wallet to a another wallet. What is the big fuzz about this. Every coin is design to manage this. This is the basic that a coin must be able to do. If you did not get that right the first time then maybe you should not be shouting / cheering about that so much now. Just finish the LN and go to the next problem and fix that. This is not a Olympic game.

Well you have every right to think the way you think, that my post is just FUD and that I am just complaining and bitching about LN. The fact is still this. This article is based from an interview with  Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun.
Since you are installing this to all those shops and merchants every day. Do they(your clients) actually know that LN is in beta version? Do you explain that to them, or ask them if they know about this? Do you think it is ok for them to try this tech for us, just to test it for us if they don't know all the facts?

The most amusing thing with Bitcoin community is that every time you like to address a "problem" question, something that has not anything to do with price predictions you get a fuck of answer. Yes that will make the problem, concern go away. No wonder Bitcoin are never together with any other companies at the seminars discussing about crypto related things. It is impossible to have a discussion.
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:50:17

@_date: 2019-02-25 07:28:09
By Bitcoin if you think it is a good investment. Do some research also about other coins as well, after all we are all here to make money in we have plenty of options.
This is just an example. I am in no way suggestion you should do this.
If you buy 1 BTC today = $3800 and the ATH is about $20k
If you buy Vet for the same amount you get about 950000. The ATH for Vet is $8.46
My point is that if Vet even gets to half of what ATH was you get almost $400k
For you to get the same from BTC yeah you get it.
Every altcoin is dependent on BTC price. When BTC goes up all altcoins go up and the other way around. Just keep your options open and don,t blindly put everything in one basket. This way you might get some real money some day

I don't see how a scam can be good for Bitcoin. Usually when you read about a scam it is related to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community is scamming and the Bitcoin community don't care about that. It seems to me Bitcoin community is cheering and spreading most of the FUD towards other coins. Very strange. There are other coins that try to work for what is the best for crypto in general, not only what is the best for their coin only. Not Bitcoin, they do whatever they can to make BTC come first, not caring about what is the best for crypto. The BTC community is doing some much damage at the moment for crypto. No wonder the total market cap is so low and we still have to wait for years for the mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-01-27 10:24:37
I don't think 10% discount is enough. If you pay for a meal $30 the discount is $3, but the transaction fee for paying with BTC is more then $3, plus you have to wait for the transaction to go through for about 10-20min :( Who would use BTC for this?
