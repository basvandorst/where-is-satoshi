Man, after reading your posts, I hope you get help for your addiction. Good luck!

He's not wrong. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:51:28
Not any different to what gamblers say. My point still stands and it was only made in good faith.
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:50:28
Are you euphoric?
@_date: 2014-12-09 14:52:04
Faggot. Watch your bitcoin crash lololol
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:21:33
Enjoy poverty, kid. Goes to show all of you want to make a quick buck, not use it as currency.

Your get rich scheme was never going to work. Back to work you all go. You never knew what you were doing. Enjoy your nosedive.

Why? Since the asshat below didn't understand, why as opposed to cash?
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:54:22
Nice photoshop 
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:54:47
Another scam? This is great for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:07:03
Your gamble will not payoff.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:53:43
Stick to poker, Travis.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:06:39
Yup spot on mate
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:25:00
As in why over cash or credit for such a simple purchase? 
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:20:40
So you wasted $500. Good job!
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:50:13
Are you still seeking help for your gambling addiction?

Be your own bank, lol

Exactly. I find bitcoin cool if there are no fees and it was actually stable. Other than that it's harder to use than the dollar.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:10:17
A penny stock gambler hoping to get rich on bitcoin. You don't care about anything but hoping to get your fix and hoping it bounces back.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:26:51
Euphoric. I can smell the Neckbeards in here.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:53:17
100% of his paycheck is in this coin. I'm assuming he has to pay bills with it so he loses on actually paying bills and how much he has left over.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:54:48
I just browse and post my one off comments. What I gather is that no one here really uses bitcoin, but only hopes for some huge return.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:28:27
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:56:16
Don't worry, you're not going to with this get rich scheme hahahaha
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:17:58
Your get rich scheme was never going to work. Enjoy your mh370 nosedive
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:23:19
And they would have no value. Great job!
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:16:31
Bitcoin, the scam that you hope will work to get rich quick.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:35:24
This sub is so toxic. Everything is good for bitcoin. Can't wait for it to crash and see you guys whine even more while saying this is good for bit coin. Hahahahahah
None of you buys anythingg with bitcoins. you're just looking for an easy get rich quick hoping the price will sky rocket. Sad. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:37:56
You just lost 10% of your paycheck in a couple hours. I mean, are you an idiot or what?
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:13:54
Just curious... Why would I use bitcoin to purchase things when I have a credit card? 
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:55:47
Fucking weirdos 
@_date: 2015-02-14 03:46:50
Nice pyramid scheme
