Is it still worth it to buy 1 btc?

There is nothing bad about tulips, tulip mania is just a classic example of a bubble. When people compare bitcoin to tulip mania they are basically saying that bitcoin is a bubble. Keep in mind that they are comparing tulip mania and not tulips to bitcoin.

Minimum order is 5 miners, and you have to buy the PSU separately.

True, I'm just basing it on the fact that it was 11k yesterday. I don't really see it dropping below $8200 so $9000 is a good entry point, but I could be wrong (probably am).

Yes, at the current price of ~$9000 one could say that he bought the dip.

$75 each week for 6 months would be $1800, if the price stays at around 4k by the end of those 6 months you'll have roughly 0.4-0.5 BTC. Now, if in a few years 1BTC is worth $25k your 0.4 would be around $10k if you hold. Always think long-term. With that being said, this really depends on the price of bitcoin which unfortunately is very unpredictable.

CEX.IO charges a 7% fee, don't use them unless you want to get ripped off.

Coinmama, but try buying a small amount first and see if it works because they use simplex as the payment processor and I guess some US banks have simplex listed as fraud.

China has played all of its cards so people have stopped panic selling. Now people are back to buying bitcoin before it reaches &lt;$4000, easy profit.
