Having been a former BoA employee, they do this every 5-7 years. From 2000-2008 it was free student checking, then they removed that. This free checking scheme stopped bringing in new accounts, so they kill it and start free-checking for a new demographic. It's lame, but it works.

While a company like that should certainly have weekend support since BTC does not sleep, you knew you would get your funds come Monday, then wanted your BTC back because it was appreciating significantly.
I honestly don't see anything fraudulent nor would I consider anything stolen here. Seems you're just salty about your own decision to part with your BTC right before a significant value appreciation, and you're looking to place the blame elsewhere to make yourself feel better.

Thanks for the announcement?...
Kind of an atheist neckbeard thing to do.

How much would your Grandad charge to make me one of those!?

Funny thing is the Federal Reserve isn't actually a Federal institution, it's a private company that *loans* the money it prints to the Government.

Plan on hodling for 5 years minimum.
Then, barring any catastrophes, pay my debts, get a new car, and build an Earthship in New Mexico.
All without having to "cash out".

They'd need to actually act on the will of the people instead of their own selfish and corrupt interests in order for the people to agree to give them money.

Right?! Another nice bump up when everyone can make transactions again

I'm cuttin' the kid some slack, this is probably the first risk he/she has ever taken with their money, it's scary to do at first.

I still like your initial response, regardless :)

I'd say you're 100% right that colonizers won't have need for currency...at first anyway. Eventually once it becomes a well-established settlement and the colonizers become more independent, maybe even on the cusp of being their own civilization, some kind of currency would become necessary.
My thoughts would be that crypto would serve that purpose best.


There a dozens of crypto currencies today, could be viewed as gold, silver, copper etc.? Crypto in general wouldn't have a specific end, as one can create a new and/or more appropriate and/or relevant one, but imagine having 1 satoshi hundreds of years in the future being the equivalent of finding a chest full of dubloons.
Blows my mind.

u/kibb_ that person is a sub-troll who just shitposts.

When Bitcoin becomes a regularly used currency, the Government loses power to control the people, and eventually won't be able to do a damn thing without our informed approval if they want our money.
It's something revolutionary that will shift power back to the people, you're doing your part, as every bit you give away adds more people to the Bitcoin team. Great work.

I run a small part-time business making a product that companies buy at wholesale and sell at retail, I siphon about half of that money into BTC.
I look at it as physically mining BTC.

A debt free person is indeed a rich person IMO.
One of these days there won't be any need to transfer to fiat, so hopefully next time you're in there will be no need to "get out" in order to use the wealth you accumulated.

Hello 2 day old Redditor!
Many in this sub have been having technical discussion since it's inception, and right now what is happening is something they've been waiting and working years for despite countless people telling them that it's stupid and pointless.
So I'm not really bothered by the circle jerking, they earned it. The technical discussion will come back soon enough.
FYI, sidebars here on Reddit typically contain information/resources commonly sought after by newcomers to that particular sub!

Kind of reminds me of how when I first started working in the industry I'm in, friends were concerned about me getting a "real job".
5 Years later that industry has exploded and people are banging on the door for jobs all the time.
They'll come around.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:04:11
Haha I wish supercar was part of it, I'm no millionaire, it was just nice that something I saw potential in came to fruition and people stop talking about "real job" as if working for money in general isn't a real job.

If I knew back in college what I know now, I'd get a part-time job and pump 1/2 my paycheck into some kind of investment, in 2017 that investment is crypto.
Graduating with a job, zero debt, and the ability to buy a house and car is pretty baller. Of course I graduated in the recession and there was absolute shit waiting for me after I did so, but I digress; you have the right idea, keep it up!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:42:28
Yeah, "error, error, error"
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:02:37
Yeah, things seem to be going normal-ish but slower now, they're getting slammed hard.
