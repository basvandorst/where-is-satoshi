Should I store in a created btc vault or just the normal btc wallet on coinbase? or is there no difference btw them
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:04:04
exactly my point, they dont even allow a healthy debate. This is not the reddit way. They might like to call bitcoin....cash..... supporters shills and ostracize them, but what they're doing by censoring us is no better.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:20:09
flippening? with what?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:33:11
I wish they had a whitelist system where they loosen the restrictions on a user and only tighten it if they abuse it by spamming or shilling other coins. Flagging posts with just the hint of a mention of bitcoin or its short form name is simply full of paranoia. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:30:52
They're never responsive. I've tried messaging them before (both to their email, reddit, twitter, etc) about their stance on b2x and if I'll get both coins on my wallet.... still no response to this day. I prefer using this subreddit for anything bitcoin related as a lot of people are usually online all the time here :D
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:56:28
Been waiting for a day, please help:
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:33:37
sigh, this sucks
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:17:17
yea, im very shaky on that. I've been looking at past data and based on the multiple hourly news I read on bitcoin, it seems a lot of people are watching closely for the price dip. At the moment demand seems a lot greater, so even if a dip occurs, I feel like a few rich people will immediately buy a large chunk of btc, immediately shooting its price up. Im still on the fence, but as the date for the fork gets closer, I'll be able to make a better judgement
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:03:24
i plan on selling my btc before fork and buying in bulk once the price dips. i'll have the usd stored on bitstamp so i can instantly buy based on the market changes
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:13:26
As someone who has been using localbitcoins for a while and have bought quite a few from sellers there. Try to avoid doing cash transactions. Stick to bank transfers. You'll have the reciept to dispute if a situation arises. No gurantees with cash.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:28:39
It's the best option I have. I rather ask people on the internet for their advice (especially since it seems like a lot of people in this subreddit have a semblance of what they're talking about). Not saying I'll follow it blindly, just getting opinions so I can make a decision after more research.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:01:54
will you boost it?
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:45:04
he makes valid points... so is it just whales pumping into bcc?
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:42:43
if everyone did that, wouldnt that pump up BCC even more?
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:43:53
i guess, i'll buy 1 bcc just to be on the safe side. might go up or down, but it's better than any regrets in future.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:19:09
If you bought it recently around 6500-7000, I would say to sell it before the fork and re-buy once the price dips. You make a decent profit and get to reinvest that money back into btc and get more of it. A lot of people are saying that there will be no dip, but there is a very high possibility and its going to come especially considering all the uncertainty with this specific fork. I bought mine at 6500 so I'll be selling mine somewhere around next week and buy back once the price begins to dip

Thank you, I was unsure about it as i had just previously transferred a bitcoin at the same rate, but the second one didnt confirm. Then again, it was before the pump of the other coin. Also, I understand the large amount of shit posts by the other group, but if the mods delete posts actually talking about bitcoin, it leaves a sour taste. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:29:54
yes, i have the seed words stored securely. Could you explain to me how I would go about claiming those b2x coins from mycelium?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:17:54
Thank you very much! I've been dying waiting for a day for this txn to finish.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:11:49
we lose the chance of getting some extra money, but i rather protect my initial investment than chasing after a few extra thousand bucks. It would be awesome if the price dipped below 6.5 k so I can buy even cheaper bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:26:24
I currently have my btc in mycelium phone wallet. Will they give me the b2x coins or is it better to move it to a different wallet?
EDIT: as for the risk, I entered knowing all the risks and am prepared to lose if the btc crashes. I just dont want to lose it in a fork where it could be avoided :P
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:46:29
I usually would but with this fork being really uncertain and not knowing which side will win, I rather not risk it. I bought in at a high price unlike others who had since btc was cheap, so prefer to sell it. and then buy whichever side wins. really hope its btc tho :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:05:53
Is this option availble for both the beta and the old app, or just the beta?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:27:59
I know. I have engaged in r/cryptocurrency before; however, my posts are getting flagged when I talk about bitcoin. That's my issue. The censorship is almost dictatorian at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:30:13
I doubt that's going to happen. If b2x couldnt dethrone btc, bitcoin cash will not be able to.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:48:58
How can the spouses get the bitcoins in a divorce? the owner can simply create a new wallet and transfer it there. If the spouse insists, he/she can create a fake wallet with only a fraction of his bitcoin wealth and say he lost the rest to a different alt coin. If I do get married in future, Im not telling my wife I have bitcoins lol.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:54:57
im using bitstamp, I'll sell one bitcoin on localbitcoins to get the cash in my bank and the other bitcoin on bitstamp and store the usd there until the fork is over and the price dips, allowing me to buy the winner bitcoin. its the safest strategy for someone who bought in late and is not sure about the future rn.

"However, it does not check or enforce rules regarding block size, which means SPV wallets (as designed today) will follow whichever chain has the majority of hashing power, regardless of the details that separate the two chains that will soon exist.
What this means is that unless you tether your app to a node of your choosing (a powerful feature that is available within the app today), your Bread will end up interacting with whichever chain has the most miners. If the majority of the mining power switches to the other chain, your wallet will also switch to follow that chain."
Does this mean, you will change my btc into b2x of your own accord or am I missing something?
P.S - This was taken from your blog post on how you'll deal with this fork.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:35:49
would it simpler to store the btc in coinbase? they say they'll do the split for you. I understand thats another risk im taking by storing there, but since Im not tech savy, i wouldnt know how to get the b2x coins if it involves anything complicated.
