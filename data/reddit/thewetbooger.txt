This is why I don't frequent this sub like I used to. Mods please ban memes \(except for the [classic gif]( on big up/down days\) and all others go to some sub for the mindless. I come here as the only real source for news and not have to filter through 5 memes to get to 1 legitimate story.

probably because they're headed in the direction of Zimbabawe with the reapportionment of land. Things are about to get very bad down there. Could be the next Venezuela if they're not careful.
There will probably be a significant export of wealth and of course bitcoin will benefit.

How would a poor venezuelen transfer their bitcoin from one another? If one can barely find food to eaf they may not have the tech in hand to use bitcoin

They verify traffic through google analytics and if the site is collecting advertising revenues through adsense they are able to verify that which is most websites. 
I've bought and sold over $100k in websites over the last 5 years and never had an issue.

you should try selling it on a site called Flippa. I've sold more than a few on there and is great minus their 10% cut.

Might I ask how? They hold the buyer's money in escrow and do a decent job verifying everything.
