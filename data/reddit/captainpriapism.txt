lol at this being a few posts away from the one telling people not to do any thing rash if theyre depressed
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:12:15
lol i bet youre lying about all of this 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:54:03
dude unless you bought in at under a hundred bucks and are selling now its always been too late
that dude with the im out post is literally going to be the most successful person ever on this sub

i dont use it at all, im not into speculation
it just strikes me as overly confident when statistically most of you wont profit
and hubris is always hilarious
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:11:42
look at all those real things you can do with your new currency, like potentially exchange it for the old currency or get scammed for drugs
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:58:38


because youve just taken for granted that youre going to profit in some way when in reality its a gamble and youre among the first people to take a risk
people are claiming theyre going to hold onto it until its a million dollars lol, its like children fantasizing 


well i have real life money to buy things with, and dont pester everybody i hang around to invest in cryptocurrency that you cant really risk doing anything with because of its volatility
so theres that upside
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:44:36


lol go on then 
all your profit is potential until you have it in your hand, and youll probably miss your opportunity

its just kind of cringey that youre all celebrating every time it goes up as though that translates to wealth for you
theres so much smug and its going to be cathartic to watch people lose everything because of it
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:33:29
youre not actually making money yet though
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:45:26
if you got in early and sold recently then good on you for finding someone willing, but im talking about people who plan to hold onto them 


theres that hubris i was talking about
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:02:43
lol get it while you can but dont plan to be doing it long
a couple of grand isnt the same as anticipating hundreds of thousands
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:15:24
lol do you think youd be able to cash out at the same time as everyone else? what effect do you think thatd have on the value
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:27:27
the other guy said it less rudely than i would of
but lets just say, are you going to cash out soon? if not anything more than losing everything is entirely theoretical
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:31:17
haha yeah theres no risk thats how speculative currency trade works
its great to buy anytime especially at an all time high right before a drop 
that being said i cant wait until the real crash happens and people lose everything after being so cocky
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:32:33
hm i cant see a problem with this being a major currency
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:45:16
LOL at "please effectively give me a car for free so i dont have to risk exchange"
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:09:57
im just scoffing at the people who think theyre all automatically rich when only a few are going to profit overall 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:51:04
you should invest all of your money, that way when you get a billion trillion gazillion dollars that youll totally be able to cash out you can gloat at me and really teach me a lesson
