Is Cloudbet still in existence or has it gone bankrupt? Try and make a withdraw from your account.....it will not be forthcoming as I have learned from my own personal experience. No response or help from Support whatsoever!

"Additionally, the majority of the best repositories offer segregated bullion storage which means that each person's bullion is in their own segregated spot and not mixed with other people's bullion. "  ........Nonsense!!
The repository which are controlled by the big financial institutions have quickly learned over the years that not everyone is going to show up and ask for their gold all at the same time, thus they the safekeepers of this gold have sold it/traded it off many times over and have left IOUs in its place. Why do think that when Germany and France asked the Americans to send back half their gold that is stored in NYC that the Americans asked to negotiate a return time frame of 7 years.......for an amount of gold that would fit into a small cargo ship.....think about it ....7 years. The Germans and French are not to happy about it. You should read more on their experiences on getting their gold audited which the Americans have tried to block continuously. ...if it is so separately segregated then what's the problem.?

Ok, thanks for the replies
Obviously this is a much smaller exchange than I originally thought.

Not true for Canada...there are many, many Localbitcoin traders across Canada that accept cash deposits at their banks and have done so for years. Please do not spread mis-information.

I have been trying follow this ongoing Bter story. Question?  Bter reported 7170 btcs stolen. Was this the total number of btcs that they had in their wallets (cold or otherwise)?? I could not find a clear answer!
