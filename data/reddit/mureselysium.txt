Can I express my sympathy in a few words for our \[ShitBerg\] become financial cake genius?
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:44:42
okay, there is no Bitcoin keyword in it. Though I believe we can be mature enough to not dismiss a potential issue...tightly linked to Bitcoin.

TY for the article, paste your BTC @ I will send you a bit. 
Part 2:


In one sentence they proved they understood nothing about Satoshi's manifesto. How many lines of Wall Street coke do you need to absorb though your ass to write such a nonsense?
So, I don't understand, let say a reddit post, so I need to copy it to understand it better. Yeah! Duplication makes understanding of the source better! Pure genius "Wall Street licker" , I hope you'll be paid in Libra aka Hidra \~
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:32:36
There is a difference between capitalists and libertarians. Bitcoin is for libertarians, Libra/Hidra for capitalists. What will they do next? List JP Morgan's coin? A bank coin?!
No, they screwed it. It will make Kraken even more powerfu., These guys don't mix with the coins, their security is s-q-a-r-e. They have a best-you-can-get security  tutorial.
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:07:25
Mhhh, ShitBerg named it Libra, let's rename it Hidra, as a reference to the snake beast in Greek Mythology. It has many heads, which respawn if they are cut down. It resembles the biblical Beast from the Apocalypse chapter 13, which computed number is 6.6.6. I don't remember how Hercules defeated the Hydra (actual spelling), will find out.
Regarding Coinbase, it's not my favorite anyway. Kraken is my choice, incredible security.
Hidra has to be taken care of... KMA ShitBerg.
@_date: 2019-06-23 04:15:50
Again, as I wrote, the target keyword is _Hidra_ because Hydra is a lexical form further from Libra, because of the greek 'i' (=y). Take the time to read pls, I have little time explaining.
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:41:10
ok then, do your thing, create image hacks with the ShitBerg covered in piles of creative shits and create a funny trend, without hate :-D
Find out his birthday and prepare a shit avalanche with your friends for this occasion, be inspired, the guy deserves it. He wants to become the World Bank by a crypto spirit fraud!
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:24:40
I don't know what is wrong with you, why so much anger and hatred?
@_date: 2019-06-23 10:17:31
Thanks :-D
I watched the first 25th seasons of the Simpsons, it is an awesome piece! Still, don't remember this quote hehe

Koolio young man. Well, I have no newsL. You mean I create a subreddit? I'm new to this sub-matrix of the great Internet matrix...

We have to be able to distinguish the father from its garbage creation, to distinguish the ShitBerg from his own shit, the Libra/Hidra. Adding a second codename is a better protection again outsiders understanding of our language. Once they will understand what's going on, the pop corn will already be served :-)
I send you a High5 for your good remark :-D that's how you build an effective critical thinking. Continue on this path and one day you will be able to distinguish the fake news from the truth, one definition of critical thinking.
@_date: 2019-06-23 05:03:47
Hahaahhaah, good one!
@_date: 2019-06-23 05:28:10
Mhhh, candy title to boost their own coin...noble.
About this cyptos popping like one gallon of pop corn, there is a hidden scheme. The old "Divide and conquer" scheme. By creating 3000+ coins/tokens you actually dilute the original Satoshi Nakamoto's creation. When you are a dark investor/Bank holding, you have piles of $ to spread around, to pervert peoples minds in your hidden interests: weakening the outragous Bitcoin. So, you start using your news papers fellows to create the frenzy trend everyone-needs-his-crypto, because when there will be 7Billion crytos, you won the game, BTC is dead, it is economics mathematics (unless all the shitcoins are equivalent to zero).
Last summer I had a Tw talk with SatoshiLite, LTC founder. If I were to summerize the crypto "equation" I would write:
BTC + LTC = GoGeta.

Guys, I have a funny idea. I bet there are some good CS triggers among you. Is it still possible in CS to hack the wall spray? We could make something funny... :-D
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:35:57
Good day bandit,
Here is my summer 2018 intro, still roughtly applies  . My account on Tw was hijacked, Tw being implicated (political ties...). I can't get this account back, not that I want to continue on Tw, but I don't want manipulators to write in my name.
I like your mixin' style :-) Actually, after writing the Hercules/Hydra post I remembered something. In my memories, Hercules cut the heads with a heated sword. A shortened version of what you found.
Thank you for the memes collection data! One remark still: the title, it is misleading. We don't want to help ShitBerg in being a successful pretendant of "The Man against Sovereinity" delusion. He is as fake as fake news. What about "Hidra: 6 slices with /katana" ? It is a reference to a 6 lines slam text I wrote yesterday morning, I want to record as soon as I have a proper mic and a decent background soundtrack.
Here is my  visuals idea, mixin' Zelda Skyward Sword with Hidra slicing, using a flaming sword! How about this? Bullet | no-Bullet?
(how do you instert CR in here? (new line))
