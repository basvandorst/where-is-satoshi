There will be no dick eating tonight!

My stupid phone auto-rotates my screen. It knows... 
@_date: 2018-06-30 08:46:58
How did this go down exactly? Did the IRS hit you up or did you consult a tax expert and found out that way? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:26:22
No, and the only time I don't want it to is when I'm looking at roller coaster guy in a bear market. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:21:21
That's gonna make doing my taxes so much more fun next year. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:03:54
Not if you actually have the money to back it up and pay it off right away. You can get cash back. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:51:34
That guy... Any excuse for auto-cannibalism.

I only had a loss as well, but I did do some crypto to crypto trades. For instance, I purchased Bitcoin to buy Neo immediately, within a few minutes after I bought the Bitcoin. I'm down about as much as you and made zero gains, so would I have to report any of this? 
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:21:47
I'm holding everything still. No realized loss or gains. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:22:02
To be fair, the iPhone *is* a piece of junk. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:05:21
Did it require any manual adjustments or was it perfect with just the imports? 
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:22:13
I'm still holding everything. No realized loss or gains.

I think after the whole BTCP debacle, I could genuinely wear this pin as a badge of honor. They will have to pry these damn coins out of my cold, dead hands at this point. Never letting go! 
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:38:08
I was only kidding. Gosh, you iPhone people are so serious. (Kidding, I'm kidding.)
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:52:50
I just decided I'm gonna let it all sit for at least a year no matter what, also because of taxes (in the US). Alllllllllmost cracked and thought about turning some litecoin into USD temporarily when it hit 137. So glad I didn't! It shot up right after that, would have been the story of my life. Now I'm even more determined this is the best strategy. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:11:23
Awesome. Good to know, thanks! 
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:57:13
Two year old, please.... 
@_date: 2018-03-14 05:12:36
Yeah, this really needs to become something that's not as easy to make a mistake with or it will be a disaster. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:31:11
Do they require ID? 
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:55:40
Do you need to have an ID for using it? 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:19:18
For me they usually arrive a day earlier than what they tell me. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:32:50
Wildcard, bitches!!! Yeeeeeehaw!

I can't buy trees until I have my enormous mansion with my enormous yard to plant them in.

Been hodling BTCP, so basically I can apply doge years and it would come to roughly 21 years. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:27:07
She was also a bit of a hypocrite, if I recall correctly. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:35:11
Men... 
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:31:41
*Then suddenly, a loud, drawn out beep rings through the house. A tiny door is opened, then slammed shut. Mom's chicken nuggets are ready. Just in time.*
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:19:57
Nah, I'm just happy to see you 
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:56:04
I just want a decent coffee mug with the roller coaster on it. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:23:20
How many Bitcanes is he getting? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:45:01
This. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:58:53
Yes. But then again, I didn't have much left. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:34:16
So romantical.
