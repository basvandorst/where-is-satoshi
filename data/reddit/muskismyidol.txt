Well I guess this is where blockchain needs some development and innovation but seems hard to implement owner verification without compromising the safe and secure nature of crypto currencys. I'm thinking something like adress confirmation and standardized transaction processes could be helpful.

Bitcoin might just go on a loooong vertical journey before some real action starts again.

What you guys are forgetting is that he could confirm himself if the bitcoin address he sent his coins to received his coins or not. That's the whole thing about block chain and open ledgers. And if his coins reached him he can prove in front of some legal entity that he is in the right.

I still believe it might take more time then end of 2018 before we see a new ATH.

What he meant is that the store owner, who you sold your BTC, could have in an attempt to keep your BTC without paying you, tell police or whoever, that the address you send your BTC too wasn't his adress. As long as their is no physical evidence that proves what address is his address, it could be hard to prove who is in wrong or in the right, expecially if something like that would happen today where almost everyone has no idea about crypto and how it works.
