Seriously, I would've loved to have used GDAX but they wouldn't accept my license taken with my front facing camera, nor would they accept a crystal clear 18 megapixel image and uploaded directly. 
No clue why the 2nd method wasn't acceptable, everything was clearly legible. No response at all from customer service regarding this issue.

You can't do that for 30 cents with bitcoin either

I don't understand why so many want BCC to fail? They've split off so if you don't like it, don't use it. I thought the years of stupid infighting would've ended after the split but I guess some people are too immature to let it go.

You'd think it'd be cheaper to tell the hacker to piss off then restore the systems...

It's ok friend, calm down. Thanks for the help. 
Edit: bitsquare doesn't have an android app. This is why it's not as easy as you make it sound. There's 40 different exchanges but trying to find the ones that are legit, have low fees, quick processing and ease of use via android app takes time to figure out. Which is why I'm here looking for assistance in that task.

Well gox was an exchange and they didn't let you have access to your private key. They essentially said "your bitcoin/private keys are safe with us" (They werent). Wallets on the other hand do let you have your keys so do transfer from exchanges to wallets when you first purchase bitcoin. This is also why you want a backup of your private keys. 
In essence bitcoin is two parts, the bitcoin address which functions as a public key that you share with people so they can send you money and the corresponding private key which is what lets you spend those bitcoin.
You could back up your private key digitally or even write it down on a piece of paper and put it in a safe (cold storage). Any good wallet will allow you to import your private keys so you can spend and transfer your bitcoin.

He didn't say differently, the headlines are taken out of context. He said he would keep some portions for a while as he transitions to his new plan so there aren't people without insurance for any period of time.

You can't just say "look at the charts" and expect everything that's happened previously to happen again. Granted there will be a correction, but it's impossible to say how low or when.

Hell it's still **up** 20% over the past month. Is this scary to people? Oh no I'm not getting 100% returns this month! Lol... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:32:00
This is the smart answer. Wait for the bottom, give it a day or two to start rising again and buy there. I did the same thing at the top. Waited for it to drop for a day or two and saved a lot of money these past few days as it continued to drop.

you can trade all sorts of online goods for bitcoins through the bitcoin forums or bitcoin-otc. Paypal is an obvious choice but many dislike paypal transactions due to easy charge backs. Personally I've traded a few thousand dollars worth of e-mailed amazon gift card codes for btc
@_date: 2012-07-23 02:31:40
blockchain.info can export/import paper wallets
@_date: 2012-11-02 00:40:43
Simple. Say I want $100 USD worth of BTC. I'll post on the bitcoin forums or on otc something like "Have $100 Amazon gift card, want equivalent value in btc".. or if i'm in a hurry i'll add a few percent so maybe say "have $105 gc, want $100 of btc". When someone agrees to buy i'll purchase the gift card from amazon and have them send the code to my email address, then just give the code to the buyer and give them my btc address. Whole process can take just a few minutes

OTC is awesome and it's really not that hard. For me it's been basically the only way i've bought btc and it's saved me a ton of money on transaction fees
1) Use GPG4Win and create your username and password.
2) get mirc and log on to freenode. Follow the instructions for how to register your nickname with nickserv
3) Join  and the bot gribble will message you. Tell him ;;eregister "yourircnick" "your gpg key". The bot will generate a url that has a gpg message for you to decrypt, decrypt and send it back to him and you're registered on otc!
4) in the future all you'll have to do is ;;eauth "your nick", decrypt and ;;everify "decrypted message"
Then you can both add orders to the order book or simply sit there in chat waiting for someone to accept your deal

Because he was attempting to take make drug use safer for users. Him trying to have people assassinated obviously doesn't make him much of a hero but there were drugs that were on the silk road that people used to improve their quality of life (for example, people with cancer using marijuana to combat chemo side effects). 
Granted people also used the silk road just to get high, and people would have done that with or without the website, but at least this way people could be reasonably sure of the product they were getting and not have to deal with street dealers or potentially being arrested by police.

People that say there's nothing backing it either are totally ignorant of how bitcoin works or are intentionally spreading FUD. What do you call all the computers that mine it and run full nodes? Or the blockchain itself? Do they have no value? What about the ability to send money within minutes globally and securely without a middle man? Does that have no value? Is a 57 billion dollar market cap "no value"? What about the things that you can buy with it or the ability to trade one for thousands of dollars, that's certainly a value. 
The technology itself is what "backs" Bitcoin.

No, no one is expecting you to count those zeroes because no one is expecting you to try to exchange bitcoin for bolivars based on a reddit TIL post. It's more like a visualization of how shitty the bolivar is (or how good bitcoin is in comparison).

I highly doubt there's be $2k anywhere in the near future. A pull back to maybe 3k, at which point people will be buying for value and stop the drop. To get less than that would need some kind of major issue to happen.

I'd watch out for this guy if i were you guys. Last night I was completing installation of this server per this post  He messages me about 2 hours into it, asks me how it's going, I told him I was almost finished with it and within 10 minutes the server reboots and the password had changed. He blamed it on someone else working on it at the time, a convenient excuse since i was supposed to be the one working on it.
Long story short, it's installed but now he cant figure out how to configure it and those same 3 BTC (*edit: oh i'm sorry he's offering 3 in bitmarket, 2 here) he was offering yesterday are now being offered to complete the task and I would strongly advise against accepting because you will not be paid, likely "due to an event outside his control", just let him and his scammy/copycat poker site fail

bitcoin-otc can have your BTC bought or sold in minutes if the price is right

hmm i thought bitcoinica may offer that as well but i have no idea how it works, anyone care to ELI5?

the site is still relatively young but growing. There's many buyers but not many sellers, so if you had access to that equipment you could likely post it and get a pretty penny for them
@_date: 2011-08-12 18:54:00
this looks great. The one thing i dont get though is buying (or i suppose selling)...what do you have to do, bid at least the asking price to get a buy to go through (and vice versa for selling)

I dont know for sure but i would assume it's basically you have the public key, which as far as these are concerned is your username, then a private key under a tamper proof sticker (password). When you're ready to convert the physical coin to an actual bitcoin you log on to the site with both and they transfer the 1btc to your wallet.

perhaps they could outlaw brick and mortar businesses based in the US from doing it, but really almost anywhere online is fair game

all this talk of bitcoin loans from a bitcoin bank, can someone explain to me what motivation a debtor has to repay a debt to a bitcoin bank? Because of the relative anonymity and irreversible nature of bitcoin I dont think there is a motivation to pay back the debt to the lender and therefore fractional reserve banking would fail

Never played it but i'm pretty sure second life is a game that somewhat disproves your theory. Besides, if investing your looted bitcoin back into your armor means you're better suited to go and earn more bitcoin then it works out fine

That's not necessarily true. The SEC gave the bitcoin a dollar value and therefore victims can be paid restitution in dollars via liquidation of other assets he may have. You are correct though that he may still have ill-gotten btc that may not be relinquished
