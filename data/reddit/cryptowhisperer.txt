I totally agree

Thanks for the tip OP! LCW is awesome, very impressed.

Did you read that Mike, Gavin and Jeff?

If he stopped calling Bitcoin, 'Bitcoin core' we may stop calling his lovechild Bcash, or Btrash.

Then we can use the Blockstream Satellite downlink. Whilst Nick has a good grasp on radio wave propagation his idea is impractical. Radio wave propagation via the FED layers is unreliable at best. Paths open and close constantly. Way too many variables. One of the biggest issues is the low power and receive antenna requirements. FED layers favour different frequency bands at different times, so frequencies will need to change constantly during the coarse of any given day or night to maintain service. This will mean the recieve antenna will need to be a log periodic array (or similar) and at shortwave lengths say between 6-18 MHz this means a huge antenna, much like a TV antenna but much much larger. Satellite distribution is much more reliable and viable.

The ruthless and unethical power brokers behind BCH are corrupting this space. They are bad actors and must be called out at every opportunity. We do not want corruption in this space, it belongs to us and so we are the ones responsible for controlling it. We can't sit back and allow this to continue, enough is enough.

I am very disappointed that Nick would present such a lame idea. The ionosphere is unreliable for the distribution of radio waves around the world. There are too many variables. Sunspot cycle, localised weather issues, propagation paths, interference, polarisation issues-faraday rotation.  Using satellites would be a much better idea as there are far less variables involved. Blockstream have already implemented this idea with Satellites so Nicks idea is already outdated and redundant. 
I just can't believe this, is that Nick on stage or some imposter :(

I like it, but it seems to grate on Rogers nerves.. what a shame :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:54:25
He is very intelligent but this idea is really really bad

Your statement: "r/bitcoin is clearly owned/controlled by Blockstream" is completely false. Whilst this subreddit is 'generally' pro-Blockstream as far as sentiment goes, Blockstream does not control or own this subreddit.  Its fair to say that most of us within this subreddit see Blockstream as having a positive influence on Bitcoin.

We could have had this much earlier if it wasn't for the big block drama queens delaying the process.
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:14:00
Thanks for the alert!

Great to see, very encouraging!

Poor buggers, they will end up with industrial deafness .. antminers are bloody noisy!

I look at this way, if a cryptocurrency has merit and its owners/promoters have a sense of ethics and fair play then they have no need to try to hijack another coins brand and marketshare. The fact BCH owners/promoters are not following the ethical pathway to adoption can only mean they are greedy and unethical, this behavoir is being recorded every step of the way through reddit and steemit posts et al. This stain on BCH will forever remain and at some point will bite back hard.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:00:16
BTC and BCH are in a one sided propaganda war. The aim is to increase BCH adoption at any cost, mostly at BTC's cost.  BCH has the consensus of the Chinese miners backing them and there has been a huge investment of time, money and resources made from both the miners and the BCH promotors/collaborators. This investment has to be paid back in the form of  **transactions on the BCH network** The miners need a HUGE increase in transactions to make all of this worthwhile. This is what the propaganda is all about, shifting marketshare to BCH by fair means or foul.

Funny how his attitudes change. Not that long ago he said Lightning was good, he said "I love Lightning" But of course since BCH emerged Lighting is now bad.
Roger does not understand Lightning.
Hubs cannot control the network
Hubs cannot steal funds
Hubs can only observe, but anyone can observe on-chain transactions
A hub is a central component in the network, but it's not the same centralisation that Satoshi was concerned about.
As an example..that kind of centralised control exists today with Bcash where the Chinese mining cartel Bitmain/viaBTC have created the perfect monopoly around Bcash.

He has already dug his own grave, but he doesn't care. This plan he has of allowing BCH to use his patents freely and using threat of legal action against other cryptos that currently utilise the 'inventions' is very dangerous.  I doubt he will succeed, but the chaos he will create by just trying will be very damaging to the crypto-community.  His ultimate aim is to bring Bitcoin down to its knees and have BCH standing as the only crypto-currency on the market.  This guy is  a megalomaniac and a very dangerous one at that
