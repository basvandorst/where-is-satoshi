Hey mate, a bit off topic... I was wondering how you're finding using bitcoins as a whole in the Netherlands? I am travelling there in February 2015 and I am quite excited about actually being able to spend some bitcoins in-store, as an Australian that isn't much of a opportunity.

I'd love to hear about this once it's released on Android and iPhone (Mum owns the latter..). If it's as easy to use as whatsapp than it will not be hard for me to convince friends and family to use it - on the flip side, if it's harder to use than whatsapp, it's pointless.

You could actually buy at gox prices and make a very small % mark up and still be the cheapest seller in my state. If I was unemployed I'd be giving this a fair go.

I recently (yesterday) went through the process of creating an account and being verified on mtgox. I didn't really want to use it due to recent issues they have had but I found as an Australian this was the best (lowest fee, least bullshit) exchange.
I was online and verified in a matter of about 5 hours. I am still waiting for my AUD cash transfer to display in my account, it has not even been 24 hours yet. Apparently this process 'can' take up to five business days.

Does anyone know Bill Gates' bitcoin address? I want to donate... SAID NO ONE EVER!

Who just purchased 58 shares @ 5BTC..?
@_date: 2013-09-02 08:24:47
eBay is your best bet for cost recovery although scamming on this sort of item would surely be common.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:37:45
I received interest from coinlenders.com - pity he did a runner (or got hacked, depends what you want to believe) with everything.
If I could do it all again I'd buy bitcoin and stick them on my computer. I would have made more dollars, I would have been secure the whole time, I would have done what everyone told me to but I ignored them thanks to greed.
@_date: 2013-06-30 22:34:54
I pretty well did the above when I bought in to bitcoins, no regrets yet... Although my 50/50 balance from when I first started is more like 80/20 ASICMINER/Coinlenders now (and it has paid off) but I'll fix this soon enough.
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:18:23
So, you're an idiot?
@_date: 2013-06-12 22:11:23
Am I the only one around here that thinks big bang theory sucks?
@_date: 2013-07-23 01:59:29
They may also draw attention to bitcoin, in turn raising the value... Wouldn't that be a shame...
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:55:40
I think you should have bought an STi ;)
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:19:02
Also, can vouch for coinjar.io
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:17:52
There are no Aussie exchanges. I refuse to use Gox (I did earlier in the game). weexchange.co exists, I won't go as far to call it an exchange. Your best options are paying the fees and going coinjar.io/btradeaustralia.com
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:40:08
Hey mate, CoinJar provide pretty good service (I don't think any compare at the moment but that changes on a weekly basis). If things do not go as expected send their helpdesk an e-mail. You'll normally have your BTC within a few hours.
@_date: 2013-07-11 22:35:31
Too true... People ask me questions about it and it makes me realise how much they don't know about the fiat currency they currently use so explaining bitcoin becomes quite a task. I usually point them to a few diagrams that explain it better then I can.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:18:32
What a dick.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:15:01
coinjar.io is the only service I have used in the past 6 months or so for purchasing bitcoins. I would use btradeaustralia.com failing that.
@_date: 2013-09-13 01:09:21
I was naive in reading the title, I guess I'm just too innocent minded - note to self, escort = dirty prossie
@_date: 2013-07-05 04:13:27
Looks good mate, bookmarked that link. Let me know if they fail.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:05:32
It's very easy to check spot price on coinjar.io now as well (granted, you do have to login). Whenever I have checked btradeaustralia it's always more expensive per bitcoin than coinjar.
@_date: 2013-07-15 04:46:51
Free pizza and beer, well why didn't you say so... It's only a 19 hour drive to Melbourne
@_date: 2013-07-05 00:52:50
I had delay in my BTC purchase yesterday. Here is the response I received from my support ticket:
"Due to huge demand for our service, our system may not have sufficient amount of Bitcoins available and it requires manual transfer. Please be assured that the exchange rate is locked-in and we will honour it regardless of how market moves. We have multiple sources of liquidity and general this kind of problems are somewhat infrequent.
We will try to deliver Bitcoins to your CoinJar wallet within a few hours. If it still doesn't appear after 24 hours, please let us know using the "Contact Support" form.

Hope this helps in some way.

@_date: 2013-08-29 03:30:10
No age restriction on a BTC wallet to my knowledge...
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:44:02
Maybe for the amounts of bitcoin you were transacting. I have used blockchain.info a couple times for a quick 'throwaway' wallet and 2FA would have been painful at best.
@_date: 2013-08-29 03:51:06
You make a valid point good sir. Sounds like a fun social experiment none the less.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:34:02
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:19:44
If you're irrelevant then that must also make me irrelevant. Remember, in your future interactions, that this is the internet.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:22:01
I did this on friday night while wasted. I realised immediately what I did however waited until I had recovered before reopening my wallet. When I went to reopen my wallet I noticed it pointed me to some random directory by default, I recall thinking that the average person (I am part of the master race working in 'IT') would be shitting themselves right about now.
DON'T BITCOIN WHILST INTOXICATED!
@_date: 2013-07-01 05:00:23
Hahaha, I am serious by the way. If I see you, I'll raise it high in the sky. You should stop for a chat if you spot me :) Good on ya mate!
@_date: 2013-09-29 23:55:31
I also find this rather strange... All they need to do to get a whole lot more orders is release a picture of a plugged in, hashing KnC miner.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:27:23
SHUTUP AND TAKE MY AUD!
@_date: 2013-07-12 03:18:11
...and then I make the mistake of mentioning the bitcoin 'shares' I own...
@_date: 2013-09-29 22:52:53
I see you haven't done your research at all. Good day sir.
@_date: 2013-09-30 22:56:03
If you can't figure this kind of stuff out on your own buy bitcoin not bitcoin mining hardware.
@_date: 2013-08-29 01:49:23
What is the advantage of doing this? Why not just keep your coins separate and all do your own thing? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:29:59
I always wondered what the religious/non-religious ratio was like with the bitcoin community.
Judging by the comments thus far.........
@_date: 2013-06-03 23:59:10
You're either not going to get any responses, aside from my own, or you are going to get flamed because this has been answered a trillion times over.
Regardless, I'm going to try and help. Where are you from?
@_date: 2013-06-11 22:02:25
I think they have already judged for themselves... I tend to agree with them.
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:00:23
Maybe their wallet was with inputs
@_date: 2013-07-22 01:13:42
Fedoras are awesome

Another reason to support your local crack dealer :P
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:10:45
weexchange.co seems to have set up a market now, I personally won't be using it as the website is still hideous. Coinjar.io is what I use currently...
@_date: 2013-06-27 00:39:34
I'm not positive you can use this service in NZ but it is the best (lowest fees, quick turnaround, no need to physically go in to a bank) service, to date, for buying bitcoins without dealing direct to an exchange in Australia.
Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with coinjar at all, I have however used the service on one occasion.
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:53:48
Real-time trade option, bitcoin is still to volatile for these guys to put specified prices on items.

Now that's stuck in my head... thaaaaaanks
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:58:49
Keep replying, you're really making a point here. I will be a better man thanks to you!
@_date: 2013-07-16 03:28:56
I uhh... Yep.
@_date: 2013-08-21 00:08:58
Ohhhh that's where I went wrong, my universe reset timer must be out
@_date: 2013-07-25 23:38:42
Anyone effected by this would have been completely covered by the bank and received everything they lost back. If they lost bitcoins for a similar reason - they would be screwed. I don't think this pushes people to turn to bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2013-06-11 01:31:20
I feel guilty for laughing at your reply
@_date: 2013-10-29 03:19:11
If he's so smart tell him to give that 'google' search thing a go :P
I believe that I can never ever unbiasly talk about bitcoin so I attempt to never talk about it. If someone cares than I am always open for questions but I've given up putting it in peoples faces.
@_date: 2013-07-16 12:11:08
How does the company contact you after you've submitted your service request?
@_date: 2013-09-24 01:00:51
I hate news.com.au. I don't need to see news articles about viral videos when I can just watch the fucking viral video. It is good to see bitcoin has some good press on there.
@_date: 2013-07-26 05:11:14
Ok, so... a website is compromised and lots of people lose bitcoins, how is it advantageous that said website was using bitcoins instead of credit cards?
@_date: 2013-06-20 22:12:00
ALL OR NOTHING SUCKA!
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:31:11
Sadly, bitinnovate (from my experience) offers a better exchange rate then most localbitcoins.com vendors. It sucks being Aussie and trying to get cash in to BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:56:16
You sound pretty mad to me. What'd I miss?
@_date: 2013-08-21 00:07:48
If you have to ask this question then it is never a good time to invest.

That's the spirit, get defensive about it. No one will think your 'boyfriend' is actually you.
@_date: 2013-06-11 21:58:17
So, when can I use AUD?
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:28:10
Yes, I could be a bigger fucktard - I could have lost 301BTC by storing it on blockchain.info without 2FA. I appreciate your insightful comments.
@_date: 2013-07-24 00:04:36
Good work mate, you should really get a professional on the website to make it a little more appealing. I do know someone who would accept BTC as payment and would happily chat over skype if you are interested (it's not me).
@_date: 2013-08-29 23:20:55
Use 2 factor authentication.
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:27:08
lol, you pretty much just defined exchange... check out coinjar.io - most appropriate but still not what you're looking for. I don't know any Aussie that has used gox recently, sorry.
@_date: 2013-07-05 01:41:04
No questions, just wanted to say: Good work :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:24:38
Because people still purchase them.
@_date: 2013-09-16 23:44:02
Because what you're suggesting is fraud.
@_date: 2013-10-08 23:03:11
Am I to assume you're a US resident?
@_date: 2013-07-05 01:53:26
I should have mentioned that BTC was present in my account about 4 hours after I received that e-mail which was about 5 hours after making the AUD-BTC request.
@_date: 2013-06-13 01:55:41
I agree completely, I just enjoy being a prick :P
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:39:52
Please note, in this case: Greed = my own stupidity.

@_date: 2013-11-05 07:07:28
Now that is an impressive stance to take. You have my admiration sir.
@_date: 2013-09-17 03:16:51
Well then order a BFL unit and cancel the order once it's been shipped, then get BFL to take you to court - then we will know for sure! Gosh I'm glad I wasted my time typing this.

Good stuff, I look forward to using your service in the future. It's great to see a company fill the void for buying BTC in Oz (with fewer fees).
If only you were a day earlier in announcing ;)

As an Australian I would like to say: Good work! :)

I'd be interested in knowing if there are any BTC accepting bars in Bris... Don't suppose you know of one?
I read a post from a user a while back saying he normally sits upstairs at The Exchange (131 Edward St) in the city and sells BTC for cash on Thursday evenings. No idea what his username is...

"Needs to be addressed" - Do you understand how bitcoin is valued in the first place...?
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:56:16
I was thinking the same thing...

Coinlenders worked well for me as well
@_date: 2013-07-09 00:20:25
@_date: 2013-07-01 01:50:26
Yeah, it doesn't 'even' out... I have still made a large profit buying in around the times/costs you've given as examples...
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:54:52
Sounds pretty similar to yourself:
"Please call ahead and let us know how much you want."
"Please note that bitcoin sales take place for only 1 hour per day."
Anyway, keep up the good work.
@_date: 2013-09-05 01:15:59
Lose hundreds today, gain hundreds tomorrow. I am Australian, our dollar has gone from $1.03 to $0.91 when compared with the USD in a matter of weeks/months - local "official" currencies could also be considered volatile (maybe not to the extent that BTC currently is).
@_date: 2013-06-27 00:35:46
Hey mate,
I'm sure you will get a better response if you ask specific questions.
To answer your question:
Yes, there are 'experienced' traders out there. I'd consider myself a very novice one.
@_date: 2013-09-26 01:52:13
I think you need to understand how many 7 year olds are using bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:12:15
This is awesome news! It'd be nice to be able to view the current AUD - BTC exchange rate when using your service.
The ABN seems legit:
@_date: 2013-06-12 22:16:32
I would like to use this service but I don't know if I trust it or not...
@_date: 2013-08-20 04:10:18
I commented in the thread but just to follow up here....
I made a coinroll.it bot that utilized the martingale betting strategy - I put about 0.1 in the account originally, that hit approximately 1.95BTC before LOSING EVERYTHING. When you bet hundreds of thousands of times, martingale WILL fail you.
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:57:51
In my opinion - You did your job, you attempted to tell someone to research something revolutionary. It's now up to them.
On another note, this might help:

I assume it's from the lack of including a fee, in saying that I have no idea how you would resolve your issue now that the transaction has already been made...
I also have no idea how to include a fee with bitcoind.
