Eh, I for example buy and hold inside the exchange only to withdraw once I reach certain amounts, (fees to move out are actually pretty low, like 3$ last time I checked), and monthly salary is of around 5$ (500mil bsf)

At least your ex helps you out in this situation, even if she treats you that way. If you suddenly become a millionaire don't forget that. I wish you the best of luck with your surgery.

It's like watching history being made right through our eyes, even if it's just a little race, sometime in the future people will watch this videos and be impressed with this kind of thing. It makes me enthusiastic about going out of Venezuela and start living the real world :).

You're 100% right, but even then if he can prove that he got them before marriage then there should be no prob.
