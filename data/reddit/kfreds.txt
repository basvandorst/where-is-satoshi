Hi Synzvato! I'll give you a response right now. I'm Fredrik from Mullvad. After being a long time lurker of I decided to get an account :)
The only reason we have servers in the U.S. is geo-restricted content.
None of our exit nodes log, and we don't believe there is any law that requires us to either, in any of the jurisdictions we have servers. That being said, if we found out otherwise the choice is easy; We'd stop having servers in that country. We identify more as activists than entrepreneurs, and I'd rather shut down my company than start logging. Of course there is no way for you to actually verify that I'm speaking the truth. Judge us and our whole industry by our actions, not our words. In the case of Mullvad, here's a non-exhaustive list off the top of my head:
* We have no external resources on our website, such as Google Analytics (as you already noticed. Thank you)
* There is not a single form on our website where you CAN give us your name, your address, or your email for that matter
* You are not even allowed to pick a username, your account is identified with a randomly assigned number
* Mullvad was the first VPN service to accept Bitcoin
* Mullvad is the only VPN service to accept cash in the mail (please prove me wrong, no really, I'd love to be)
* Mullvad was the first VPN service to provide a custom OpenVPN client (to protect against various attack vectors, such as leaks through Teredo, IPv6, DNS)
* Mullvad was (probably) the first VPN service to correctly advise customers on Teredo leaks. Many still get it wrong, exposing themselves completely
* Our custom VPN client is open source, so anyone can audit our code
This got longer than I planned to. Oh well, enjoy, and thanks for choosing Mullvad.
Edit: Formatting. Yes, I'm a total Reddit noob.
