Yeah, doesn't stop anyone from using Bitcoin, just stops them from using Coinbase as a wallet.

Potentially also bottlecaps.

Honestly that's one reason it gets to be so progressive. Scandinavian politics are generally pretty progressive anyway but Iceland is small enough that is able to adopt more experimental policies from a pretty culturally similar people.

The major advantage for those that aren't adverse to managing their own bitcoins is that you can now invest via tax advantaged accounts such as a Roth IRA. Set aside a percentage of your Roth purchases for the year for Bitcoin and in X years when you retire it won't be taxed.
Bitcoin is in its early stages, but as it gains more acceptance you can bet you won't be able to dodge the IRS with Bitcoin holdings for long. Not paying taxes on Bitcoin in 20+ years could be a substantial advantage to those who held them directly.

Bitcoin could definitely be part of a balanced investment portfolio. It's a high risk investment, but balanced properly it could end up being very lucrative over the long term.

I get the feeling this is because it's relatively difficult to spend Bitcoin the way you would normal currency still. I know us denizens  are at least somewhat comfortable with it, but most people that transfer things in and out of bitcoin are more concerned with what is on each end than what is in the middle.
As it moves closer and closer to becoming universal 'internet currency' more and more people will be more comfortable dealing exclusively in Bitcoin. They will be less concerned about what that bitcoin is worth in 'dollars' and more concerned about what it is worth leveraged against goods and services.
Once it reaches that point the volatility compared to other markets will be severely reduced.

That sounds about right. I think general cultural acceptance will be kind of transparent in a "Pay with your local currency, transaction happens through bitcoins" kind of way. Countries with traditionally volatile currencies will definitely start piling up Bitcoins though.

It's decentralized nature makes it effectively difficult to crush entirely, but it wouldn't be hard to scare legitimate businesses away from bitcoin which would really crush it's potential future as a stable currency. Right now bitcoin is gaining traction because it's easy to convert to and from 'normal currency'. I can't pay most of my bills with bitcoin though, so I still need to be able to transfer wealth in and out of it. If governments start making that hard to do it will definitely be problematic.
So bitcoin is designed so that it can't just go away if a government doesn't like it, but it's availability and desirability is based on the idea that you can trade with external fiat currency without problems too.

Agreed. I trust my money locked up on an encrypted USB drive in my pocket more than I do locked up in someone else's bunker.
