I'm assuming he means you can't have a partial person. But he fails to understand we are not in the single digit units, and we are talking statistically, not how many people we will have at dinner.

So I'm generally ignorant here, isn't concensus simply established by hash power? If so, it is conceivable then that a government could put forth the resources to have majority hash power. You could substitute government with large corporation too. The possibility goes even higher as either would have access to breakthrough technologies, like quantum computing. I must be missing something, and it isn't this simple.

Here's your problem: "investment". Losing 600k is rough though man, I'm just starting out my career in a well paying job, but it'll take me maybe a decade to save that much.

...except...double? ...So 100% off? Lol.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm reading wrong, but did it say $749 was "breakout" levels?

Yeah that defeats the purpose of what a farmers market is, unless you've got a whole foods type store that calls itself a farmers market, the stuff should be way cheaper

I signed up as my primary exchange a week back to deal with BTC and LTC. It's way less sketchy than BTC-E and I have only had one minor blip logging in yesterday where it kept cycling from the captcha to non-captcha logins. Anyways, it quickly resolved itself, and haven't had any issues to speak of since.

Except aol and prodigy didn't exist before internet. I like your first analogy better. Also, you use your computer in the shower? How do?

Haven't thought it through. I'm honestly not too concerned about the money, and my attitude is that I don't expect to see it again.

While the message could have been delivered in a better worded post, I do not disagree with its point. We are the salesman for a new product, a product that requires customers to learn prior to having function, and this means (like most things) presentation and execution is key. Gifting paper wallets to some may be perfect, and to others foolish. Just like any product you have to know your audience. While it is important to be gracious for all gifts, it is not necessarily good for bitcoin marketing to blanket gift everyone you know "only" paper wallets by themselves.

I'm not talking about what can be done to the backed digital currency, I'm talking about what the digital backed currency can do for the common Joe. They aren't going to think about the gov't shutting it down, that thought isn't going to cross their mind because it's a small incremental step from what they're used to now.

Combining your answers to 2 and 1: How can something not have intrinsic value and be above zero? Aside from that though, you DO need it to have a certain intrinsic value. That certain amount? Greater than current value stores. Otherwise, who would adopt it? In order for it to facilitate payments, it must have intrinsic value (aka it's ability to facilitate payments BETTER than current methods).

I'm inclined to agree, but I bought in yesterday just in case :P. Perks of having spare cash!
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:57:29
There isn't a liquid enough exchange though, that's my point. For there to be a liquid exchange to allow instant cash, you're going to be paying a lot of fees. So it once again is just a western union (maybe even worse because there's more steps and possibly cost more). The only real way it will be liquid is if the coin is adopted widely and you can pay directly with it.

Replying what I posted above so you'll see:
1) Bitcoin's intrinsic value is in its frictionless and instantaneous transfer capabilities. For this to be realized in a functional aspect though, Bitcoin must become widely adopted. But for Bitcoin to become widely adopted, it must be able to capitalize on its intrinsic value. Catch 22.
2) Bitcoin has a lot of newly minted wealth. Personally, I would cash out if I bought in at inception and had lots of paper money. If Bitcoin hovers around 800 for the next month or so, what's to stop everyone sharing my sentiments from actually acting on them? I know that the market has survived these flash crashes previously, but I think 800 is a breakeven point where people aren't going to be buying back in due to the amount their cashing out; they would have a "squeezed it dry" type of mentality. I know I would. I'd immediately move on to more sustainable safe investments. I know only the speculators would do this (probably vast majority of the market at this point), and those with ideological beliefs in Bitcoin would hold, but it's not likely they will maintain the market.
3) My biggest fear - Humans psychologically fear change, and as such, we must be coaxed into incremental steps. The system Peter describes in which a new digital currency that is backed by a established store of value is logical, probable, and would be much smaller a change from our current system. Sure, I know, the whole point of Bitcoin is to fight the man and decentralize gov't control over finance etc. etc.. But again, those who are of that opinion, would find speech easier than actions in this case. It's hard to imagine that the majority with any moderate net worth would be willing to convert their assets into Bitcoin rather than this insured digital currency. I'm not saying this specifically is the scenario I fear, but something like this. An alternative product with a smaller change from our current system that we will more readily adopt on a psychological level.

Hang on what?! Like your 401k as in pre-tax dollars? I'm skeptical, but if true, how in the world do you do it?

I concur. I can't find any more videos with him though, anybody got links?

Well at 2k votes there's only 23% as voting as 'Buy'. Part of me is like "yes, more time for me to accumulate", but the other part wishes adoption inclination was higher

wtf did I just watch?

I bought into Bitcoins yesterday, and I'm beginning to feel wisps of doubt after watching this interview. I personally really like the opposing viewpoints Peter presented that you will not see on this sub. All very valid and, despite what other comments say, are coherent. Could somebody knowledgable please take on his main points? Stefan didn't seem like he was contesting much.
EDIT: Here are the main points he presented that concern me:
1) Bitcoin's intrinsic value is in its frictionless and instantaneous transfer capabilities. For this to be realized in a functional aspect though, Bitcoin must become widely adopted. But for Bitcoin to become widely adopted, it must be able to capitalize on its intrinsic value. Catch 22.

I agree. The financial world is analogous with the business world. You are not be able to assert the success of a product based purely on technical merits alone. This is why marketing exists, and every other non-technical role in a company.
