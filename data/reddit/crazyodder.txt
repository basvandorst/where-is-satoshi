I just sold it off, I bough it at $210ish and I decided to keep 1.5BTC in my wallet while I sold off the rest just so I'll have something to keep building off of.

Lol I guess I know Coinbase was at $250 when Circle was at $253 and Snapcard was at $253

Yeah I was wondering myself how they make it profitable to pay more for bitcoins but I guess I'm not going to complain. 
By any chance do you know how long it takes for Circle to deposit your sold Bitcoin into your linked bank account?

I have been a day-trader with stocks for quite some time but I just recently got involved with Bitcoin. Is there any reading you recommend?

I agree I just sold off all but about 1.5 BTC, at $253.47 I bought it at ~$210 so it's hard to complain about a little bit of profit and a decent learning experience.

Man I forget what online firearm vendor it was that took BTC, they cleared me back when coin was like $700 and I thought I was rich lol

Dude! Thank you so much! I really appreciate it. I already love this community!

Wow! I just set up the account and linked my bank account and got the Bitcoins instantly. It was great. There was an error on my account when I made it, and I called customer support and they were great and solved the problem quickly.

Yeah for sure! Thank you.

I swear to god I didn't even know you could do that until the other user gave me one. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:01:48
I think I might go with Circle for this. Is there one you would recommend over the others? Or are they all about the same?

How does it work? Can I just use a debit card and put my Coinbase Wallet number in there? Sorry again I'm noobing it up.
