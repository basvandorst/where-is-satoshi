Hey, 
the Blockchain is bloated. To many transactions, to small 1 MB block. Just stay cool. :-)

I already contacted them. Look at the link with the screenshots. I documented every chat with the Freewallet support.

My Bitcoins has been moved today in two different Wallets.
My Wallets wasn’t included!!!
I have received 0,01 BTC to the Freewallet.
When will get the rest 85 BTC?
Am I going to get my Bitcoins back??

Thank you for your answer. 
I understand that your support team is working to the limit. But you have to understand too, that I’m waiting now over one month... !
Is it possible to proceed the process faster with a fee of 3%??
To the community:
I’ll inform you about the refund. When it’s proceeded... stay tuned :-)

This are my Wallets
This Wallet Address 1FAnNVjBaVtVgzthXPoW42HSz8L422h1aw  is just a parking address to change the Bitcoin to Monero. You can see this address in my screenshots from the chat with the support.

at the moment my Bitcoins are on this address, but it is not my wallet. My Freewallet shows up zero BTC balance.
Now, I want the BTC to get refunded back to one of my 2 Wallets above, where I’m owner of the Wallet.
Almost one month I’m waiting now!!

Keep us up to date.

Hey Shubham Singh,
be patient.
It took 2 months to get my Bitcoins back. 
Freewallet is full loaded with new users, they have a lot to do. Keep calm and just be patient.
Kind regards!! God bless you!
