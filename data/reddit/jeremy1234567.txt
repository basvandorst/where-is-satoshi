Haha yeah that's not gonna happen. Everyone would just return everything if bitcoin prices go up.... and then buy the shit they just returned for a lower price.
As long as prices are listed in dollars, then your refund will be in dollars.

Wow thats a big order... Right now the daily limit is 50 BTC, and that's with level 2 verification.

That sucks man. This kind of stuff could actually turn out to be a big problem. It seems like it was pretty easy for that person to set up a scam website and rob you. You probably weren't the only one either. More and more of these scams might start popping up.
 If this kind of stuff keeps happening, people will be afraid to spend their bitcoins online.

Attention Coinbase! I purchased bitcoins with you and they were delivered on time. It was the exact amount that I ordered. Please help. Has this happened to anyone else?
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:35:29
Coinbase actually pays the miner's fees themselves.... except I had to pay a fee once when i tried a really small transaction.
I've sent .001 bitcoins with no fee. But I tried to send .00006 bitcoins once and it made me pay a fee, and the minimum was .0002. I'm not sure what the cutoff point is, but it's somewhere between .001 and .000006.
It felt weird paying a fee that was larger than the transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:50:40
Well that's what you get for purchasing bitcoin in advance for an undetermined value.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:28:01
What's the slow route? I just created an account but I haven't entered my bank info yet. Are you saying there's a way not to?
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:24:12
It didn't fail if they're still holding it.... it only fails if you sell it for less than you bought.
It's highly probable that bitcoin will reach well above 900 at some point in the future, maybe even very soon.

Because you don't know that they'll keep going up. They could just as easily go down. A lot of people think it's going to crash. So those people would say the opposite of what you said - "Why would anyone NOT spend your bitcoins right now? They might never be this valuable ever again."

They can accept a bitcoin payment that instantly converts to dollars and they never have to handle any bitcoins ever.

I wouldn't mind if uBTC becomes similar to dollars someday though.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:05:17
no hes saying why buy anything when you could buy bitcoin instead.... spending bitcoin is the same as not buying it
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:05:07
But one of the reasons why it's such an interesting speculative commodity right now is because of it's amazing potential. People can envision a future where bitcoin goes mainstream, it's widely accepted by merchants everywhere, and the demand for bitcoin is high.
And that would make the price very high.
I'm talking best case scenario here. I don't know about you, but that's what I'm hoping bitcoin will become, and I think it has a good chance to do that.
If the U.S. government banned bitcoins, that would drastically limit their usefulness... The amount of people wanting and using bitcoins would be much less. And the price would be much lower.
And there wouldn't be as much interest as a speculative commodity, because the potential for bitcoin to become mainstream would be dead.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:34:24
But then you're right back to where you started. You've got to deal with all the banks and the fees again. It wouldn't be much different than what we've got right now.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:10:31
The good news is, this means that we're still in the extremely early stages. As it gets easier, the price will go up.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:00:20
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:23:37
I wouldn't call $40 a "plummet". Swings like that happen all the time with bitcoin. I thought you were talking about dropping down to like $500 or something.
It usually makes a huge surge upward before a big drop. The momentum is picking up right now, but I think it could go even higher and faster before the next drop. Maybe even get up over a thousand.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:36:48
I have no idea what you're trying to say....

What's stopping bitcoin from destroying banks?
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:05:20
Actually someone pointed out that I may have been wrong. I've only used coinbase paper wallet, and that's exactly how it works. The paper wallet is a new address, and you export the coins to it.
However, someone said blockchain paper wallets can also be used as a backup, so I'm not sure.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:38:43
To make it easier some people have been suggesting using satoshis as the default unit instead. For example, the number above: 0.00193682 BTC could be translated to 193,682 satoshis. People even came up with shorter slang for satoshi, such as "bits" or "coins".
So instead of saying you have ".01 bitcoin", you could say you have "1 million bits"
This would get rid of the decimal all together, and make it easier for people to comprehend. Definitely something to consider, especially if the price keeps rising and we're going further and further into the decimal places.

"bitcoin-whore" just posted some good info in another comment but here's some additional info on paper wallets:
It sort of works like a piggy bank. You can keep adding funds to your paper wallet over and over, but once you want to cash out you do it all at once. Like smashing open a piggy bank. Never attempt to cash out less than 100% or you risk losing the remainder. 
On coinbase, go to the paper wallets page (account settings &gt; integrations &gt; paper wallets)  and click on history. That shows you the address and balance of your paper wallet once you've printed it out. You can keep sending bitcoins to that address to add them to the wallet.
The coins on the paper wallet are no longer in coinbase. They are yours. Sort of like withdrawing cash from a bank. You can import them back into coinbase whenver you want, or you could import them back into a different wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:58:36


True, but "bit" also means "a small piece, part, or quantity of something." - that's actually the first definition that shows up when you google it.
I think it would make perfect sense for the smallest unit of a bitcoin to be known as a "bit"
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:40:43
You can also have litecoins, namecoins, and terracoins... through dividendrippler gateway.... anything that has a ripple gateway you can send in and out. There might be some other ripple gateways for other altcoins too, i'm not sure.
I know a lot of people here think ripple is a scam (and it might be)... but I started using it just to see what it was all about and it's kind of cool. The other day I converted some XRP to bitcoins and sent them to my coinbase account. It's pretty easy once you get the hang of it, and I think it might turn out to a very useful service for trading currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:02:31
You shouldn't order right now. You have no idea what price you're buying at.... Just wait until that date and then decide if you want to buy at that price.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:29:20
that's strange... it went through for me in like 3-4 days.
one thing you could try is do the fast method where u give them your bank info.... then after they verify you just make sure to change your bank account password.

Printing a paper wallet is sort of like withdrawing bitcoins... they are no longer in your online wallet, they're only in the paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:03:25
It's digital currency. 
The easiest way to get some is to buy some. You can use coinbase.com to buy bitcoins with your bank account. 
You can use bitcoins to buy things, it's just a form of money.
Or you can hold onto them and sell them later. A lot of people do that because they have been going up in value a lot. So you could buy some now and wait for awhile and sell them when they're worth more.

So if coinbase stays down, what are some other fast and easy ways to purchase bitcoins between now and friday?
I'm new to this and I was just about to make my first purchase using coinbase. I've tried other ways before (mtgox, etc..) but it all seemed very complicated. I was excited about coinbase because I thought I finally found an easy way to do it, but I guess not.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:07:56
So then what's the point of calling it a bubble? We can all see it went up and then down... if that's a bubble, then yeah obviously it's a bubble. I don't understand what the problem is.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:04:05
I don't know what to do. I tried posting messages on reddit but for some reason coinbase's support team does not respond to them.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:35:53
The dollar doesn't magically hold it's value either though. In fact, the dollar is built to actually lose value over time.... so you're guaranteed to lose value if you hold onto it.
At least bitcoin actually has a chance to gain value.
Also, you're assuming that all bitcoin revenue goes directly into savings and is never spent. If you work 40 hours in a week and recieve a paycheck in bitcoin, then you spend the bitcoin on food, rent, activities, etc... it won't matter as much if bitcoin drops in value because you've already spent a lot of it. 
If you choose to keep all of your savings in bitcoin, then you are taking a risk.
Keeping all of your savings in dollars is also a risk though. Maybe less of a risk, but it's still a risk.
If you don't want to take that risk, then buy something else with your bitcoins that's less risky. Like gold or something. It's not wise to keep all of your savings in one form. Whether it's dollars, bitcoins, etc...
And yes, bitcoin is extremely volalile now but theoretically it could become more stable over time.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:41:43
Well yeah, bits refer to units of information, but I see no reason why it can't also be slang for satoshis. A buck is the name for a deer but also the slang for a dollar. People will know what you mean when it's in context. But i'm not a computer guy so I don't use the word "bits" very often, maybe some people do.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:15:43
Dude you gotta say what the price is when you make your prediction.... If it goes up 150 more and then drops 100, you can still say "see i was right" but in reality you would have lost money.

They do it for you. Each time you buy, it generates a new address. You can also auto-generate a new address anytime you want just by clicking a button. The addresses can be reused as well. I don't think you can enter your own custom address though.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:15:45
I've never done it but I think you make a cash deposit into the seller's bank of choice... once the money goes in their account, the bitcoins get released to your account.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:33:52
But that why would this "leave a bitter taste in their mouths?"
The price of bitcoin has no effect on the merchants.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:32:20
Bitcoins don't necessarily have to replace the dollar to be a relevant currency. They can coexist.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:06:47
Exactly. This guy was talking about how gold-backed currency is good, and at the same time saying how the dollar used to be backed by gold.
That right there is a huge problem. People got tricked into thinking their pieces of paper were actually gold. Then one day you wake up and your dollars aren't backed by gold anymore. And you realize you never actually had any gold, you just had pieces of paper. And someone else has all of your gold now. In fact, it was never "your" gold, it was always theirs. They told you it was yours and you believed them.
At least with bitcoin, there is no trick. And there is no reserve of gold for someone to steal from you. The value is in the *bitcoin itself*, and the bitcoins are in your possession. Whereas with gold-backed currency, the gold is in someone else's possession.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:41:32
Bitcoins are too expensive now, it's better to buy some satoshis while they're still cheap!
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:35:21
That's not how that works.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:13:25
Yeah that kind of sucks if that happened and you didn't see it. But at least that makes it a little bit less sketchy. As long as coinbase warns you that they're going to do that, then it's fine. If they just did that without telling people then that would be really shady and I wouldn't use them anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:12:53
That's just a paper wallet... you can make paper wallets from coinbase too.
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:16:30
you're better off just buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:42:34
Exactly. 10 people out of 7 BILLION own **15%** of the gold... that's like .000000001% of the population, with 15% of all the gold. It sounds crazy but that's just how the world works. The same is probably true with dollars as well.
A small minority at the topp will own a large percentage of any valuable resource.

It's only a markup if you compare it to other places... which you said are not trustworthy.
You want a safe way to buy bitcoins, but you want to buy them at the same price as the untrustworthy source. You can't have your cake and eat it too.
The trustworthiness is built into the price.
Try buying on ebay.... the prices are ridiculous. It's impossible to get robbed though, because you can do chargebacks.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:36:40
Localbitcoins website acts as like an intermediary... they take the bitcoins from the sellers account first, then once the money goes into their bank account, localbitcoins releases the bitcoins to you. (I'm pretty sure)

its a trap!
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:38:58


It would just be the equivalent of you purchasing bitcoins on Friday instead of today. I don't think an increase in price would affect them. If you pay $1000 right now, and the price is $1000/btc on friday, you will recieve 1 bitcoin. If the price is $500/btc on friday, you'll recieve 2 bitcoins, etc...
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:06:45


I noticed that he's already received some bitcoin tips from this thread. I bet if your son made a video of his presentation and posted it here, he could get some more bitcoin tips. Or maybe he could come up with some other creative video idea about bitcoins, like a video blog of him giving out stock advice or something.
It might be difficult for him to get bitcoins in the real world right now, because not a lot of people have them. But there's plenty of people on who think your son is awesome, and they would probably be willing to give him some bitcoins if he made a cool video or something. Maybe that would work, I don't know.

Oh, I didn't know. In their FAQ, they said this : "We charge a simple 1% plus the standard $0.15 flat fee for bank transfers when you convert from USD to BTC.
Once you're in the bitcoin world, all BTC to BTC transfers are free!"
That's kind of sketchy if it's not free and they say it is. I've never dona a BTC to BTC transfer so I don't know.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:21:30
The best way is to keep it as simple as possible. Heck, if you went in depth on how dollars are made, people probably wouldn't want them.
Key points to make:
* it's digital currency
* they're worth real money, 1 bitcoin is worth over $800 right now (but you don't have to buy a full one)
* places are starting to accept them, like subway
* you can use your phone to spend them at a store or send them to anyone you want.
* they've been consistently increasing in value, they were worth $10 a couple years ago, and they could be worth a lot more in the future.
The average person doesn't really care about how they're made and all that kind of stuff. They just want to know why they should care about bitcoins and how can bitcoins benefit them.

Yea I missed an opportunity too. I made my first purchase very small (.1 btc) just to see how it worked out. That was at $700
But coinbase does not allow you to make your second purchase until your first one goes through (after that, you can make multiple purchases at a time... just your first one you have to wait)... so I had to wait a week.. the price went up over $1000 before I could buy more. Don't make the same mistake.

Yea I would expect refunds to be in dollars. When you buy a $20 item with bitcoin, you're basically converting your bitcoins to dollars and then buying the item. The store does this for you, but thats what you're doing. The item is priced in dollars, not bitcoins. You paid $20 dollars for it. If you return it, you get $20.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:14:12

@_date: 2013-12-08 07:34:04
I don't disagree with anything you said.... there would still be demand for bitcoins on some level.
However, my point was that government banning bitcoins would not make the price go up. It would actually make it go down.
The more people who use bitcoins and want bitcoins, the higher the price will be. It's really that simple. A government ban would drastically decrease the demand for bitcoins.
That's why drugs aren't a good comparison, because a government ban on drugs does not reduce the demand for drugs.
A drug still gets you high whether its legal or illegal, there's no difference... A bitcoin on the other hand, is much more useful to you when it's legal and you can spend it everywhere you go.

Most merchants use bitpay. It converts the bitcoins instantly to usd when the transaction is made. They do not hold any bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:09:48
Hmmm. Honestly I'm new to this too so I don't know too much about this. I just made my first purchase recently as well. I purchased .1 bitcoin... The order is supposed to go through next week. I was assuming that I'm going to recieve .1 bitcoin. I thought I was getting a fixed amount. I made sure not to purchase any while that warning was up.
If I do not receive .1 bitcoin I will be very disappointed.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:25:36
If you buy a $1000 item for 1 BTC (to make it simple), and then the BTC value doubles, you could return the item for 1 BTC, and buy it again for .5 BTC.
The store gets ripped off, because they just lost $1000. They are basically giving you the item for free.
The store does not hold onto the bitcoin when you make a purchase with it. They convert it to dollars. So they received $1000 when you bought it, but when you returned it they would have to pay $2000 to refund you with 1 BTC.

Yeah, I was thinking maybe there could be a way to do it on your own, without a central authority. Sort of like how you can export bitcoins from your computer to a paper wallet.
I wonder if it would be possible to export bitcoins onto some sort of blank debit card type of thing.... and have it function sort of like a gift card. Then once you spend all the coins on the card, you could just reload some more coins onto it.

Oh, my bad. i don't use blockchain so I didn't know you could do that. I assumed it was like the other paper wallets I've seen. I've never heard of using a paper wallet as a "backup", I've only seen it used as an export.

I sent you 60 microbitcoins! Let me know when you get them.
Edit: I'm a noob too so this was one of my first transactions.
Interesting note: The minimum fee on coinbase was .0002 (which is about 20 cents)... thats kind of a lot when you're sending someone 6 cents. I thought the fees were supposed to be small. A little disappointed. Plus coinbase says in their FAQ that all BTC to BTC transactions are free because they pay the miner's fees for you. ??? apparently they lied.

I think it's a little bit of flawed logic. It doesn't matter what he had in the beginning. That money he has in bitcoins right now is HIS money. If bitcoin drops to zero then he still lost the money. I don't care what anyone says.
Regardless of what he started with, that's what he has RIGHT NOW. It's his. He should take out everything that he's not willing to risk. Forget about the starting investment, that doesn't matter anymore. If he had thousands of dollars right now, would he really buy 169 bitcoins? thats what matters. he should leave in the amount that he's willing to risk AT THIS MOMENT.
If you went to vegas with $50 and won 10 million dollars on your first night..... and then gambled it all away except for $50. You could say "well I didn't lose any money"..... YES YOU DID, that $10 million was yours and you lost it.

But you yourself said that you have some bitcoins and you are planning on selling them, not hoarding them.
You're not the only one who feels that way. Like you said, they could crash at any moment... I think that's a good enough incentive for people to spend them.
So I don't agree that everyone will hoard all of their bitcoins.

That's not how division works. Dividing something doesn't create more of it.
If you divide a pizza into smaller slices, you don't get more pizza. The total amount of pizza remains the same.
If we divided all the gold bars in the world, we wouldn't have more gold.

Coinbase.com pays the miner fees themselves. So if you use them, you can make bitcoin transactions with no fees. 
However, you still have to pay a fee when exchanging dollars and bitcoins.

Well, you don't know for sure that they will go up. They could be be worth less in two weeks. If we were sure they would go up then nobody would ever sell a bitcoin ever. The uncertainty is what gives an incentive to sell some of them.
Personally, I'm not selling any bitcoins, but that's the reasoning behind it.

That really really sucks dude.
Shit like this makes me a little bit paranoid. I can't even feel safe with an encrypted desktop wallet.
To be honest I almost feel better about my coins in my coinbase account at this point. I haven't seen a coinbase theft reported here yet.
Just this week I've seen 2 blockchain wallet thefts on here, now a QT... plus a multibit user in the comments of this thread.

Notice how the easiest ways to buy bitcoins are a little more expensive than the difficult ones.
As it gets easier, the price goes up.
Also, more people buying bitcoins makes the price go up. As it gets easier, more people will buy, and the price will go up.
It's already getting much easier, and I think it will continue to do so. I remember I wanted to buy some awhile ago but I didn't go through with it because it was too difficult (fuck me, right?).
Once I heard how easy it was on coinbase, I bought some. 
I think bitcoin atm's are going to make it even easier. People are already setting those up.

Yeah that might be true, but their reason makes absolutely no sense.
It's based on the idea that they would have to actually accept the bitcoins and hold or store them.
When you use bitpay, you're not even actually accepting bitcoins. You're basically converting the bitcoins to dollars for the customer, and then accepting the dollars.
It's hilarious how they then go on to say "We do, however, strive to provide as many methods of donating as possible"
I think if they really understood how this works they would obviously accept them... or at least they would have to change their reason for not accepting them.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:25:45
I don't really know how that works... does that mean I would literally need a separate computer that never connects to the internet?
I can't really afford that... maybe if bitcoin prices skyrocket.

I saw another thread similar to this. Someone suggested calling them "bits" for short. I liked that idea.
1 bitcoin = 100 million bits. 
So right now instead of saying it's $720 for 1 bitcoin, you could say it's only $7.20 for 1 million bits 
You simply move the decimal over by 2 on the price of bitcoin to make it equal 1 million bits.
Also, it's a lot easier for people to think in terms of thousands and millions rather than .01 and .000001
And it makes it seem like you have more :)

Was that warning posted when you made your purchase? 
I'm waiting for my first order to go through, and I thought I was going to receive a fixed amount of bitcoins. If I don't receive the amount of bitcoins I ordered then I will be pissed... That's sketchy.... Even if they did give the correct "market value".... I thought I was buying them at the market value from the time of my purchase.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:12:37
Your argument was that more bitcoins can't be created = bad for the economy.
Well, more gold can't be created... is that bad for the economy? No. 
Same with bitcoins.
Nobody is saying that we need to base the entire economy on bitcoins. They can still be relevent even if we still use dollars as our main currency.

On one hand, you're saying it's going to crash... so you're saying it's going to decline in value. If that's the case then people should spend it, not hoard it.
But then on the other hand, you're saying people will hoard it, because it's going to increase in value.
So by that logic, some people will spend and some people will save. Sounds good to me.
The point is that nobody really knows what will happen, so there is incentive to spend and incentive to save.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:27:57
I just looked into it a little further and apparently if you use coinbase they pay the miner's fees, so that's why it's free.

56% of the bitcoins does not equal 56% of the worlds wealth.
Also, that's just how it works. I bet about .001% of the population has most of the gold as well.
It's estimated that the top 10 owners of gold have around 15% of it... .001% of the world's population is 7 million people, so the top 7 million people probably own a large percentage of it.

People are downvoting you but I agree. I don't mind mBTC and uBTC and all that, but there's always going to be a default unit that is the most popular. Right now people are using regular bitcoins as the unit... but as the price goes up into the thousands I think we're going to need a new default unit. 
People don't want to spend $100 and only get .1 bitcoin. They would rather get 10 million satoshis. I know it's the exact same thing, but psychologically it's different.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:52:42

That's because the demand for drugs doesn't go down when they are banned. If bitcoin is banned, the demand does go down.
Think about a country where all merchants accept bitcons, and people can spend them freely... vs a country where bitcoins are banned by the governement and not accepted anywhere.
The first country will have a much higher demand for bitcoins because people can actually use them.
Imagine if suddenly no businesses in the U.S. were allowed to accept dollars anymore. Would you want dollars? No. You'd want a different currency that you can actually use. Demand for dollars would vanish and they would lose their value. The only thing that gives them value in the first place is that you can buy stuff with them... when you take that away, you have nothing.
The government is bitcoin's biggest threat.
