I think this would be a much better idea than a bitcoin price ticker

No, you can opt to not have any taxes pulled from your check by your employer easily. Just alter your allowances.
You do not need to send in the tax payment immediately and you definitely shouldn’t. You should use the time between realizing the gain and tax time to minimize your tax liability from said gains. ie reinvesting in business (doesn’t really apply here) or things like charitable deductions that would offset your final tax bill. Just make sure you are prepared and don’t spend it all before tax time comes or you are royally fucked if you don’t pay up.

You can buy ETH on coinbase &gt; transfer to GDAX (no fees and instant) &gt; withdraw to Binance (GDAX not charging any fees for withdrawal) and buy XRP on binance without a full verification period. 
You can only do around 2 BTC worth of transactions without being verified, but if ur not verified already you probably aren’t doing $30K+ exchanges yet.

Do they monitor bank accounts? Or how does it work? Not trying to troll or be sarcastic I’m genuinely curious how they’d find out

If bitcoin isn’t regulated how would this work? Who’s ever going to know and would it be capital gain or income?

Fuck bitstamp and their outrageous verification times

Oh how do I time this? Coinbase wanted $20 to send $50 in Btc to my wallet last week so I left it in coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:55:51
My deposits are in the form of $20 and negatives my man, just looking for information to further my education
