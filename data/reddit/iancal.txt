TBH I think the fact that OP has been investing for 10 years, the vast majority of which has just been growth in the S&amp;P500 is a great example of why the typical advice makes sense, individual stock picking is not for everyone. If they'd bought a boring fund at the absolute peak in 2007, and not invested anything since, they'd still have made about a 5% annual return.

They will if you keep all of your wealth in them.

Just like coins need to work securely for people with wallets with holes in them.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:09:30
Err, yes, yes I would. Depends on the rate of change. If the money will be worth twice as much tomorrow I'd keep it in for longer (but again not indefinitely), but if it's 5% per year I'd still take money out of it.
Would you sit in fingerless gloves eating cold beans going "HAHAHA SUCKERS THAT $5 I COULD HAVE SPENT ON A BEER LAST WEEK IS NOW WORTH $5.01"? Of course not. I can spend money on nice things now because a nice thing now is worth more than a nice thing in a months time.
I do save, of course, but I allow myself to spend money on stuff even if I could get more money by waiting. Things and experiences are nice.
If there is *inflation* then people are encouraged to spend now, as their money will be worth less in the future. If there is *deflation* then people are encouraged to spend later as the money will be worth more. The key word is encouraged though, it only modifies the utility of buying now. Deflation might make the effective cost of buying now higher, but it doesn't mean nobody would buy anything.

This is actually quite a big deal, it's very worrying to have someone ask such basic questions when they're asking to be trusted with large sums of money.
@_date: 2013-04-23 06:31:25
Although they've taken ages, they've sent the first devices to reviewers and devs. Also, they accepted payment at a dollar value, so it was no different to getting a refund if you'd paid in dollars. Had the value gone down, he would have received *more* bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:52:09
Well that puts you basically in France. It's not quite like that up in t' North.

We have no idea how much faster or slower the bitcoin network is at doing double sha256, because we don't know how fast the supercomputers are at it. The FLOPS are irrelevant as there are no floating point calculations to be made. Bitcoin ASICS are capable of 0 FLOPS

Only if people consistently think it's worth more tomorrow than it was today.

So what stops me walking past someone holding one of these and stealing all their money?
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:08:47
That's a really interesting implementation, thanks for the link. I was wondering recently how to set something like this up (where the mediator had no ownership of the coins).
There are still some issues, such as the vendor may be waiting quite some time before they receive any funds (particularly for, say, holidays) which could be an issue. Also it still doesn't provide what credit cards do for protection. 
Still, it's not got to be better in every way, we have multiple ways of paying for things that trade convenience, cost and security off for one another. Some forms may dominate others, but not dominating everything is not a bad thing. It does call for some acceptance of this when shouting the benefits though.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:44:54
That depends on the use of the word necessary. You're not protected in the same way on a purchase, so it's not that it's automatically covered by the way bitcoin works, but if you mean it as "legally required to do so" then you're right.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:46:03
Yeah, exactly. The best experience would be to have a button you click and *that's it*. It has to be more complex, unfortunately (ux-wise), but not too much.
I looked into building an add-on for chrome, which would actually be pretty simple using a hybrid online wallet from blockchain. I might build a proof of concept for this, as technically it'd be pretty simple. One slight problem is that blockchain.info adds the default transaction fee of (currently) about 2-5 cents, but that might not be a blocker.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:33:55
Too many steps. For it to work, it really needs to take only a few seconds. I think there are a few possible ways of doing it that would smooth the path.
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:53:56
They are shipping.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:38:47
But what if I transfer 0.1 bitcoins as floats? 0.1 and 0.7 are great examples, (0.1 + 0.7) &lt; 0.8 == true.
@_date: 2013-11-05 10:15:25
More generally, always ensure that you don't have money you can't afford to lose in any one place or investment.
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:44:22
Can I use these to claim back money I spent 6 months ago on something that never materialised?
Secondly, the cover that credit cards have in the uk is huge because of section 75. I legally get back money for something that didn't come through (say if a company goes under) for anything costing more than £100 and less than £30000. Interestingly, I can do this as long as I paid for *some* of it on the credit card. So I can pay £10 on card, £29k in cash and am still protected for the full figure.
Bitcoin solves different problems, but claiming the 1% is cheaper than the 3+% without looking at the differences of service is dishonest because they don't offer the same rewards.
@_date: 2013-06-07 18:56:47
I think they're worth something like 100 million.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:14:48
You pay taxes on the gains. So if you buy for $100, sell at $200, you've gained $100 and will be taxed on that.
If you then buy when they're cheaper again and spend $200, then sell those for $220, you pay capital gains tax on the $20 you just made. You don't get taxed on the whole $220, just the gains, so it doesn't matter how many times a day you do it.
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:59:48
That makes perfect sense, since blocks are indivisible. If 7 is lower, you need 8 to equal it, and 8 can give 30% more security.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:53:30
I think this should definitely be implemented. A bitcoin://0fde0982... protocol would be the best solution. 
In the meantime I might try and implement a browser plugin.
EDIT - there is a provisional RFC 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:06:45
MTGox is not currently accepting orders, it's down for 12 hours.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:06:58
So, in the rare event it happens, it costs me no money and roughly 3 days without one of my cards. I have to make one phone call and don't even need to leave the house to sort out the problem.
With a credit card I can even (under UK law) pay even just £1 on the card, the rest in cash and the credit card company must still cover the full amount if the retailer flakes on the deal / goes bust / whatever. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:17:15
Does anything need to be determined? It's something that rose in value, when you realise that value by trading it for something else (usually fiat) then you pay capital gains tax. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:44:17
I suppose the key thing is that there is a way of contacting the person who owns the account. They can get a PM and get involved. One helpful thing is the amount of money is generally really small, so the security concerns aren't as bad. Accidentally losing 10c or so isn't so bad. I'm not sure what you could do with random websites like that. Maybe there are analogous things for particular places though, github or wordpress. Generic places where someone has an account. 
It would unfortunately be really easy to insert fake things into the website and you wouldn't be able to verify who it was. You could potentially alert people if the address hasn't changed. Again though, if it's a few small purchases it's not so scary.
I think it might be interesting to have a crack at and see what goes wrong, so everyone knows how not to do it in the future :)
@_date: 2013-06-28 16:44:21
In the UK currency trading would also count for capital gains tax.
It's only exempt if it's for personal use, so people don't have to worry about going on holiday.

Tagline: By kids, for kids!
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:19:29


That has absolutely nothing to do with capital gains tax. Those rules are incredibly clear cut and don't care what bitcoins are, just that you bought at one price and sold for another. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:55:44
It depends on how much it rises by. I've got a savings account that accrues interest at over the rate of inflation, by your logic I should keep my money there and not buy new stuff I want. Yet I still do.

Lag &amp; the time it takes to transfer the coins. Other than that, nothing. I made some profit a few days ago doing exactly this.
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:53:03
You do that anywhere you enter personal information. I don't consider it a big risk with most purchases. However, if the value of the order is low and I don't really trust the place I'm entering my details then I'd rather use bitcoin. They might run off with my $5 but can't take the rest of the money.
Still, I could always just revert the charges on a CC, it would only take a quick phone call so it's simply a hassle.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:36:15
It's a legal requirement in the UK. There are other, similar things to provide legal protection to buyers.


What mistakes? Buying something from a company that later goes under? Besides, if you've ever bought insurance for anything, this is exactly what you've done.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:08:11
Yeah, I never really appreciated it in school, but it can be incredibly beautiful. Complex and simple together, it can tie completely disparate concepts or ideas together. That's the really beautiful moment, when everything just clicks.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:59:29
The goal is to make it as simple as possible.
If to send money, I have to copy the address, open the program (wait for it to open), go to send coins, paste in the address and hit go, you'll lose more people than if it's just "click".
So what's the minimum we could get away with? 
If you have an online wallet then a plugin would work, allowing you to just click and choose an amount.
If there's a defined protocol, you could automatically launch the right application with the right address entered in it.

*More* stable. Doesn't mean it's particularly stable.

I don't like that because then as a player I have to trust the person who made the game with my money

Seconded, take some money out, then if everything crashes you've got a house deposit for $50.

Blort. I worked out it per month, figured it'd be slightly less than two and then wrote two weeks.

But that only holds if the value goes *up*. If you pre-order something and the value goes down then the situation would be reversed.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:35:12
The 3% includes a lot more protection for the buyer though. Buying via credit card I have a *lot* of legal protection.

To be slightly more tricksy, we could potentially say that it is showing a function which maps a real number to a complex number. Then you'd be able to draw the image above. It wouldn't be the graph of the function though, although it is a flattened form of it.
Or, you could define a mapping that when sampled into an image looks like the one above.
Or, losing the word graph, you could easily define a function which when plotted would result in this image.

If you don't have an emergency fund, you shouldn't be shoving thousands of dollars into highly risky investments.

Interesting, thanks for the response. I'll have to look into this more :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:48:51
I thought it was implied too, I fully agreed with everything you'd said I just started wondering if there was something similar that would allow you to do it. It was fun digging through some definitions again, I don't often do that, I should do it more.
