There are a couple of reasons why one might buy something with Bitcoin even if the price of a material is directly tied to a fiat. 
1) the buyer may have bought Bitcoin at a lower price than it currently trades at. This makes his purchase cost less in terms of fiat and would register as a capital gain.
2) some merchants have discounts for btc purchases.

The thing is, without doing a packet capture on the edge of your network you don't know that it's not broadcasting stuff out to somebody over the Internet.
Network attached printers tend to be a nice attack vector for getting a foot in the door on a network. (Puts on tin-foil hat)

It's related because there is a lot of money being stored on vulnerable machines. An attacker could execute arbitrary code as the httpd user.
For the rest of us, it applies because many of us have the private key for a wallet with some (hopefully small) amount of btc stored on an Internet connected Linux machine that is probably SSHable.

Multi-sig? I get your analogy, but most here would argue that 1) you shouldn't have the value of a house stored on an Internet connected device. 2) you should have backups of your keys. 
Your best point that also concerns me is the inability to fuck up without consequences in bitcoin. If I'm at a store checking out and for some reason hand the wrong person my fiat money, I have a face and a number of options for getting my money back so that I can hand it to the correct person. In bitcoin, if I send money to an address that is wrong, I'm probably screwed.
But, that scenario should be a difficult situation to find yourself in with NFC and QR.

Clustered filesystems, like gfs and Lustre, stripe data in static block sizes and bitcoin blocks aren't static in size (I don't think). Furthermore, clustered filesystems are fairly complicated and expensive to operate. 
DRBD combined with corosync is more appropriate for a fault tolerant bitcoind daemon. Probably  the best way to keep a fault tolerant local copy would be to just run 2 full nodes on separate machines and make sure your backup node is setup to be connected to your master node. 
But, you're probably actually looking for something to allow you to perform analysis on the block chain. In that case, run a bitcoind instance with Abe on top of that. Push your Abe data to a clustered SQL database provided by MariaDB or Percona MySQL.

The thing is that we're discussing 2 things at once. Technically USD as a protocol doesn't offer that protection either. The infrastructure developed around it is what provides arbitration and insurance. So the question must be can we develop an infrastructure of services that makes BTC as safe a currency to use as USD (or whatever fiat you like) for end-users. I believe that if the answer is yes, it will take significant time, just as it did for our beloved fiats.
I'll admit that I like and use BTC, but it certainly is still very beta and very questionable as to if it is a solution to a problem. What excites me about BTC or (anything like it) is that we have the ability to re-evaluate and re-architect the global financial  landscape. As a young idealistic software developer, that is a cool idea. If nothing else, I'm cheering for BTC because it's an interesting social experiment. It will absolutely make users of money modify their storage and usage patterns. But, is that really a problem?

OP says so.








Edit 1: formatting
Edit 2:
I may have mis-understood OP regarding block distribution. That said, my argument still stands. Sure, you can use a clustered filesystem, but it will be cheaper and as reliable to just run 2 instances of bitcoind on 2 separate servers.

In principle, I agree 100% with you. It shouldn't matter whether the coins given to me were previously stolen, used for drugs, etc. What matters is that I am providing a service and you are paying me money that I can spend. Unfortunately, what also matters is what other people think when I try to use those coins - especially law enforcement agencies... If they  think that I'm a criminal because I was given money by a criminal, suddenly I'm very interested in making sure that doesn't happen. Perhaps they may say I was operating a laundering service for known criminals... Because, anything those coins pay for, for now on, will be aiding a criminal. Enter taint.
I guess what I'm saying is that we have to acknowledge that there are criminals and that there are people waiting to put us in handcuffs for doing business with them. As such taint has a place. Right or wrong, that is the current state of affairs.

Packet radio? K Band satellite? Direct dial to a bulletin board? The Internet is not required. Not TCP, UDP, IP, nor any other known transport, physical, or datagram protocol are dependencies of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an application layer protocol that can be broadcast over any form of communication channel.

If I ran an exchange, I would check for taint on deposit. If exchanges block tainted coins, they lower their risk of 3 letter agencies knocking on their door. Remember, this is an  open accounting system. So, technically any exchange accepting tainted deposits is willingly operating a money laundering service. At least, that's how they went after Charlie Shrem, right?

HF works on latency and the fact that they can subscribe to dark pools and exchanges with dedicated links for hints on where a market is headed due to liquidity that isn't present on public order-books or data before other player in a market may see the same data. They also make markets. Also also,  HF uses complex order types like iceberg that most BTC exchanges don't offer. While HF does include some amount of quantitative analysis, speed is the special sauce.

I guess where you and I differ is that I suspect evidence like "a recording during a sting" are not necessarily required by the US witchhunt brigade to ruin my life. Do I trust the reddit witchhunt brigade to correctly mark coins as taint? Absolutely not. That's why I just said that I agree with you. Let's just do business and not care about where the money came from (as a society).
What you are proposing and I'm agreeing with is a major overhaul in society's opinion on business ethics (which only seem to exist for small organizations). I'm acknowledging that it is not possible for our dream world to exist right now. So.... Taint. It's a thing. Whether we like it or not, our trusty government will and almost definitely has used it. 
This has been a fun one. Good luck in CO, WA, OR, or AK.

That's false. While Wikipedia is certainly not a trustworthy source, the last sentence of Security Through Obscurity does a great job making my point. "Open source software is deemed unsuitable for and thus discourages security through obscurity, because its source code is public knowledge."
Cryptography is provably hard math. Yes, it generally relies on you keeping something secret. But, a secret is not something hidden in a mess of code. It, in the best case, is something hidden in your memory.
An analogy for security through obscurity could be that it is to Find Waldo as cryptography is to a lock with thousands of pins.

I don't disagree. Accepting zeroconf should be a calculated risk. Friction free payment channels are a requirement if Bitcoin is to ever become mainstream in brick and mortar stores. It just worries me when I hear people say things like "oh it's too hard for the average person to exploit, so I'd say it's good enough." That kind of thinking is dangerous. I'd rather hear people setting the bar a little higher. 
As for empathy and understanding, I'm pretty neutral. Actually no, I'm thankful if you're accepting zeroconf, I'm not going to exploit you. But, if I ran a shop, despite being into bitcoin for 5 years and having hodled a nice chunk, I would not be willing to accept zeroconf from anonymous customers.

Indeed. More specifically, you might be compliant... But you definitely aren't if you get hacked. Because they say so. 
PCI is actually a very good set of security practices, both technical and operational. But, check boxes are not security. And, some auditors may be coin operated. 
Source: brought my startup into a 3rd party certified pci dss level 3 service provider status. 
Edit: The ROC instructions are actually very good and not at all ambiguous. In general, I believe one should be able to fulfill all of their requirements... Maybe not some dip ship auditor's made up trash though. Don't get me wrong, there are some very good auditors out there. But, there are also some terrible ones. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:47:52
See PCI compliance. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 14:28:55
Right. As I mentioned in another comment below, check boxes are not security. But, the PCI guidelines are a good set of technical and operational security practices that can help you greatly manage your risk. 
Mostly, my original comment was to say, no XOR would not be enough when storing a PAN because PCI defines how that data can be stored. A simple XOR would be considered obfuscation.
