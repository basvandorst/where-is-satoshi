I am actively searching for alternatives to BitWage because of the treatment I received.
I used the service very successfully for about 6 months.
Each time I was paid my employer would send a portion of my check into the account they setup and BitWage would send Bitcoin to my wallet.
That worked fine and they never had any questions, although I did have to provide various identity documents.
That was no problem and I understood.
However, some of my compensation also comes in the form of commission invoices I send to customers for Agent commissions I earn on sales of products for my customers.
So I set\-up the invoicing feature and submitted invoices to BitWage each time I issued a commission invoice to my customers.
BIG MISTAKE.
From day one, my commission invoices were heavily questioned by BitWage and they treated me like a criminal.  They literally acted like I was some sort of money laundering international criminal and put me through no end of questioning, even going so far as to contact my CFO, requesting to be added to his Linked\-in  network, etc.
This is despite providing numerous documents, etc.
Then after the third such invoice they summarily cancelled my account and I was horribly treated during the process.
As near as I can figure, and this is only speculation, the amounts of my commission invoices scared them off.
I would have $8K, $21K invoices \- those types of amounts because I sell industrial equipment and even a 5&amp; commission on a decent order can add up.
I think they could never wrap their heads around the fact that I wanted to receive these amounts in BTC since it was ancillary income and not required for day\-to\-day living.
Nevertheless, please beware if you are dealing in larger amounts because they will freak out.
