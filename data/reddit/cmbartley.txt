"He added that it uses the Bitcoin blockchain because it's the only one that actually works, that has scale, security and liquidity so that you can move value in and out of it... We are not religious about that. This is a suite of protocols that we integrate under the hood to enable people to transmit value, and as other public blockchains emerge like Ethereum or future generations of bitcoin that may not even be called bitcoin, we will of course take advantage of those." --

they've really been deemphasizing bitcoin of late. It's hard to even buy bitcoin directly through the app anymore. They've been dodgy about which blockchain they're using the quote from Allaire specifically says "blockchain" not bitcoin...

depends on when you opened your circle account. I opened mine a while ago and can easily transact in bitcoin, my roommate opened his a couple weeks ago and couldn't find how to buy and hold his balance in bitcoin to save his life. He had to deposit $ and then it allowed him to send me bitcoin.

When you make $2.00/day a $0.40 txn fee is prohibitive.

This is still too expensive for much of the world.

No, I'm just pointing out that bitcoin itself doesn't perform much of a function. It's no more a store of value then a pile of rocks that someone might attach value to. Bitcoin doesn't do any work or produce any good or service. It's an abstraction of value that has specific properties from which novel value propositions derive that are unique to bitcoin. I own bitcoin and believe it will continue to increase in value, but in no way do I think it's a way to pull the impoverished out of poverty. If anything, moving the majority of the world's citizen's to bitcoin would further exaggerate the current wealth gap given that the majority of bitcoin is held in very few hands. Moreover, the lack of an adequate medium of savings is not what perpetuates poverty.

store wealth? Like putting cash in a safe is a store of wealth? What function does cash in a safe perform?

A lot of economists would quibble with the statement that you get out if poverty through long-term saving. Obtaining useful assets (land etc) and/or goods and businesses that perpetually generate value (cattle, high yield crops) seems to offer a more predictable route out of poverty than a digital asset that performs no function in the real world.

Can you please explain how the Twitter payments work in more detail? Are you planning to add support for other social platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn?

The general concept is good and site and tech is beautiful but I would like to see the rationale for why "Bitcoin is the most ideal payment system."
I'd like to see this argument made for once without relying upon ideological assumptions. BitPay and others have been trying to offer payment options for some time and neither merchants nor customers seem to be super keen on using Bitcoin for payments. 
From an economic, psychological, and user experience standpoint, what is the ACTUAL benefit of using Bitcoin for payments to the average customer?
On your blog you write "The purpose of Plutus is primarily to incentivize and enable practical day-to-day usage of bitcoin and indirectly accelerate adoption." I don't hear a value proposition in there, it's simply ideology dressed up to look like business proposition.
I can see this going far if Plutus pivots some, but from what I can tell the market has already spoken on whether it wants to use BTC as a method of payment.

Perhaps staying in SF to work on products that put crypto into the hands of the everyday man in a meaningful way without a large barrier to entry perhaps? I see that the MyGlobaliD app has integrated Coinbase...

BTC is not a useful method of payment and having to prefund an account held by an exchange robs you of the partial anonymity that bitcoin is lauded for. As such, there's no benefit of using bitcoin for POS purchases. In fact you just end up paying two spread for converting from fiat to BTC and back at the sale. You're paying a premium so that you can have the experience of using BTC with no tangible benefit. 
This is an example of very nice technology who's creation was driven more by ideology than utility.
That said, I think that tech like this might be successfully deployed in other ways. For example, international travelers might hold their funds in fiat and pay using Plutus over the Ripple network so that they're always guaranteed the best exchange rate. 
I'm sure there are other use cases but downloading and prefunding an app just so that I can use BTC or ETH for POS purchases? I'm not sold yet.

Condemnations of the business logic of bitcoin are what are so concerning to me. How do you insure funds in an anonymous, trust-less environment? Why would banks expose themselves to the liability of integrating with an anonymous financial system? Will the technological hurdle of buying/using BitCoin be too much for the average individual to overcome if the financial industry doesn't integrate the network into familiar technologies like credit cards and POS apps?

It would make economic sense to short LTC if you had the ability to push segwit support under 75% just before it activates.

Thanks. I actually mean that all modern financial instruments in the developed world are insured. FDIC or otherwise. Mt. Gox wasn't insured so many lost their money although Kraken tried to step in to soften the blow. 
But on a smaller scale, say someone hacks my wallet or steals my private key and sends/spends my bitcoin. In order for those funds to be insured, I need to be able to prove with a reasonable degree of certainty that it wasn't me that stole my own bitcoin. Given the degree of anonymity in the network, I'm not sure that a system of verifying claims as nonfraudulent could ever be developed thereby preventing the insurance of funds (bitcoin). It's hard to insure cash. 
I could see funds being insured if you hold your bitcoin in an exchange wallet. But then you don't really own your bitcoin anymore than you own your dollars in the bank. You have an IOU, and if insurance is involved, the exchanges are likely going to want to know who's bitcoins they're holding. 
I guess I see how bitcoin can function as digital gold, a store of value that has some friction associated with it. I'm not sure I can see it as a POS currency. The role of insurance of funds is an essential component to any well-operating financial system.

Very hard ro predict. One thing to note is that $40B of incoming fiat is not required to the market cap to quintuple. Appreciation can come from holders refusing to sell below $3K per coin. Price is a function of demand and actual supply not total supply. That said, bitcoin is still working to find it way which undermines belief in the token (what the he'll is going on with scaling???). Many other tokens coming out with interesting and exciting use cases. 
Nonetheless, no other platform can compare to bitcoin in terms of immutability. My opinion is that the more applications that take advantage of this unique value proposition the more valuable bitcoin will be in te future. 
Buy and hold.
