Ok, here's my story: I hadn't used Kraken in a while and wanted to check on what is going on. Since I had a day off I kept my computer close to me while I was doing other things and constantly kept an eye on kraken.com. I 1) tried to log in: it took a lot of patience because of the errors/cloudflare logos but after some time I made it 2) I tried to deposit some BTC and it took forever not because of Kraken but because (the fees are going up a lot these days) I had chosen the wrong satoshis/byte ratios. Then sent BTC with the right satoshis/byte ratio and Kraken credited it promptly. 3) I wanted to do a trade but getting to the right page was hard and then, when I managed to click confirm, a couple times it did not receive the command and the order was nowhere to be found; after trying a couple of times with some minutes in between, for the fear of duplicate orders, it went through 4) Limit orders were executed without issues 5) Now let's try to withdraw some fiat! I lost the count of how many times I had to refresh the various pages but in the end a withdrawal request was filed. Total time of the test: approximately 10 hours. Then I waited for the bank transfer and, I have to say, it was the exact duration of a standard SEPA withdrawal so zero lag and troubles in the final part of the process.
I'm not in IT but I guess the current situation is caused by unprecedented rapid growth in volume.
I want to advise everyone to stop using Kraken.com, which has always been my favourite exchange, until volume goes back to more manageable levels.
EDIT: grammar

I don't have great advice apart from:
1) use extreme patience, like if you were made of rock, and carefully choose your clicks
2) do it during the night, like at 3am
3) wait until it calms down, probably they are Ok, like, not going bankrupt and buying new servers

In my experience the exchange takes care of the success of the withdrawal transaction. You pay what they show as the withdrawal fee and they take care of the technicalities.

by the way, how's the old chap doing?

IMHO you will check less often because psychologically you will feel more confident.

wait... I thought that the averaging down was specifically aimed at the crashes IMHO.

I had a good laugh, thanks.
Btw there are some people who bought at 1000 and who haven't complained or sold. They are da real MVP.

The strategy you define as manipulation is known to bring massive losses to those who try to manipulate. To me it seems that this would just increase the total volume of the exchanges and this would be actually good news. Speculators and arbitrage do not foster volatility, they actually decrease volatility. A greater number of speculators and more arbitrage would fill in profit opportunities for traders faster and more efficiently so they are welcome IMHO.

Why the need of a specifically designed altcoin? They could just pay users in bitcoin in the first place...

Good to know. Anyway it looks like they add almost a 20% markup on the spot price.

As a user of wifi hotspots it sounds a great idea, but I'm not aware of any such software.

Good advice. Only one problem: what feelings do you have when you think you just bought low and then it goes lower? "Here I am buying at 500$, so contrarian and dark and cool, will sell at 600$... oh wait now it's at 470$." :(
I know that it's stupid according to econ theory, but the feelings...

They go bankrupt. And if they will be bailed out again they would cause hyperinflation.

in that case I'm going back to barter and live a poor life without computers.

@_date: 2015-01-20 08:32:24
I will buy and sell.
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:23:45
Cornering the market? Those who try always end up with massive losses, that's just science. I'm not scared. I'm only scared by corrupt exchange operators like Gox.
