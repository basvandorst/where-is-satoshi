My basic logic is 
1. Bitcoin rises in price to an insane level (as it just has)
2. It falls in price after the bubble bursts 
3. It stagnates 
4. More and more people start buying into it as they hope it will blow up again
5. Four is a likely premise to occur as it is the most famous crypto currency and many people want to get in on it in hopes that it "blows up" again. 
This is my essential reasoning.

Where can I find a concise summary of the Bitcoin vs bitcoin cash (or bcash?) Debate? Or could someone possibly give me a TLDR?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:55:37
True, I should have realised this.

If BTC is not quantum proof can it truly remain valuable ?
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:06:50
In the long term though, we really aren't going to be facing an ATH these next few days surely? Crypto currencies seem like they are only going to rise in value in a tech based climate such as this.

What about buying ETH?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:22:13
So its all based on luck or illegal actions? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:22:51
Surely you can just see when it next stagnates ?

Its 4am and I am sleepy so I'm not quite sure what you mean. 
What do you mean by rallies? 
Are you saying that it'd be strange to just buy bitcoin and leave it in the wallet without actually engaging with the fluidity of the market? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:41:22
Yep - and if the value of BTC rises while you wait for your account you will become enraged.

Am i too late to buy bitcoin? if i do buy bitcoin should i wait for a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:46:12
Hmm okay. My idea probably fails here. 
I have the assumption that crypto currencies will make it into the mainstream. Assuming someone was certain of the likelihood of this assumption it would be to make more sense for them to invest than not too. 
The assumption is still vague, as it does not account for which crypto currencies to invest in. However, it would still seem to me logical to invest in one of the popular ones.

What about waiting for the so called "bubble" to burst and then investing when the coin becomes stagnant? From my (laymen) perspective whenever the Inevitable drop does occur, an astronomical rise in value will eventually occur once more. My reasoning being that in a tech based society more and more people will switch to crypto currencies consequently raising the value to insane levels when it (if) becomes mainstream.

For 24 hours only 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:49:25
Okay that makes sense. 
What about my next theory: crypto currencies are inevitably going to become the mainstream. This means bitcoin should be invested in.

So how long until the lightning network is increased? And won't it make litecoin redundant? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:57:38
Seeing as everything becomes more tech based at the moment surely it is the logical step forward that bitcoins become more valuable inevitably ? There would be dips in the value, but surely it'd pay off if you wait long enough ?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:49:05
Hello I have some questions. 
Would it make sense for one to invest in bitcoin after the "bubble" bursts and eventually becomes stagnant? That way in theory, I could hope for it to rise to an astronomical amount again? 
One flaw in my logic may be that of course bitcoin won't rise again to such a high amount of value ever again. However, in an ever increasing technology based world crypto-curruncies seem to be the logical step forward. So to me it seems worth the risk. 
Could you point out some flaws in my layman understanding/conjecture please?  
 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:13:04
What do I think your all here for? I am actually not too sure.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:31:43
BTC oriented podcasts?
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:11:41
Haha. But seriously, is this theory really that wacky? Surely what I say makes sense? 
Also, yes, the fear of missing out is a good point to keep in mind. 
I have a question about rule 2. When it comes to markets, how much of it is based on logical calculation vs tripping into a pile of money by accident.

Would it be a good idea to invest after the so called bitcoin "bubble" bursts? That way I could hope that it rises again?
