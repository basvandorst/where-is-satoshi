@_date: 2017-12-07 11:21:16
maybe just let go and see what happens?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:13:52
it is very important to remain calm or the thinking centres ( pls excuse my uneducated term for this)  in your brain shuts down and you make decisions in hypervigilant fight or flight responses.  So if you feel lie you are losing your mind, maybe that is what is happening.  Also please dont hurt your wife , she is not the enemy ( laughing a little while typing this)  It is wrong to laugh at this I know, but is was a very vivid visual) :D

hahaha, yes, we have a mutual understanding

um... that sounds very much like anxiety.  I happened to develop a nasty bout of anxiety over the past couple of years due to a whole combination of factors...  I am lucky to have seen a therapist during this period but funny enough, the thing that I found that immediately took all my anxiety away was an application called ptsd coach.  It is free on playstore and there is a whole bunch of tools that walks you through whatever kind of episode you may be going through.  It is super effective and I feel bad saying this but I found it to be 100 times more effective than paid therapy.  I finally found sleep when it was hard just to breathe.  please check them out!  had a good cackle at your post, hilarious and a little sad.  keep strong you can do it :)

Please dont laugh at this but in my dream in the graphs numbers tripled, to have the next set of numbers triple on top of that creating a kind of snow ball effect spiral thing... so that it in a way to try explain it, it kind of ate  through everything so fast at a rate it couldn't sustain or it would start eating itself.  That's why the graph stopped and the data disappeared.  Weird dream sorry.  And I have no idea what kind of problems lightning has or even what it is only that it was in my dream.

Time to get a nice human sized body pillow with  bitcoin for a head that hugs me all through the night.  I'm going to have nice dreams tonight, I can tell.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:49:00
Im so glad you asked this,  Im so disturbed having literally dreamt about it this morning hahahha.  In  my  dream saw graphs behaving weirdly looked at the descriptions and saw it said lightning. I wanted to show it to my friend but all the data disappeared.   Then all of a sudden I'm in the ocean and there is  sea snake coming to steal a strand of hair at a time.. not threatening at all but coming to collect hair that has been shed.  I have vey long red hair, Im a girl.  So I try look this snake up in my dream and apparently it was called the  the Key Sea Python hahahahhahha  ...   Obviously this seems to be on my mind as well .   I know absolutely nothing about technology and bitcoin is probably the most complicated thing I had to wrap my head around.  But I would also love to know when we can expect it :)

Just a question,  Hi, super noob over here.   Am I safe if for example I just check my balance on my app at a restaurant or is this actual transactions in a restaurant using your keys ?

In 2005 or 6 an art gallery in my town had a little box at the door, every one entering was given a small piece of paper with "what if..."  written on it.  My entry was what if the world had no borders.  I only joined Bit coin 11 days ago and it is so comforting seeing so many people with the same hopes for our world.  This makes me happy.

Only been on board for 4 days though.  Asked my ex to buy some for me in June... said I must rather keep my money incase something goes wrong with his..   was expecting much worse for the last 4 days, it has actually been quite pleasant so far :)
