When it will go up again don't miss to tell them -I told you!!..
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:04:09
only if you give me at least 1BTC
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:24:35
But.. But.. aren't you the OP ?
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:12:01
It's not a scam, it's legit you just can't have access to your key and can't send bitcoin out of revolut ecosystem for now. It's very convenient for beginner to first buy crypto.

Gemini, Coinbase or Kraken (kraken has a good reputation and has very low fee but the UI is more difficult and not so friendly for a beginner)

When BTC goes parabollic like it did to almost touch 14k$ last week, is it wise to sell and buy when correction is here or just simply hodl and ride it because too risky to get rekt ?

Hell no, 10k is not cool, do you know what is cool ? 100k!

Dude is in a James Bond movie LMAO. Stop being that paranoid. Everybody who own luxury cars have a lot of money and could be potential targets, but do they stop enjoying their lives ? No! If you are not in a third world country, everything is fine.
Don't you buy a lambo a little bit to show your wealth and success to the world ?
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:37:04
Yes but what comes with great expenses is great salary.

When BTC hits 10k$ few days ago, a lot of people anticipated a correction that has never happened. Instead, BTC was vertically to almost 14k$. A correction was obvious. While BTC is still above 10500$ and up 20% on the week, why so many people panic and talk about "crash" ? Come on guys... This is nothing.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:43:04
or 2 days. Who knows

Do you compare end of 2017 with now ?
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:31:50
Gemini, bitpanda or Revolut
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:22:57
Too much fees and a pain in the ass to verify your identity with this video call... Seriously a video call ?
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:05:03
I've used Kraken, so far so good.
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:38:54
This is how to get rekt. Just hodl, sit and enjoy your Mojito.

I'm a bit sad. I invested a lot in btc a year ago and a bit in $TSLA 6 months ago just a "test-try" in stocks  and right now my tsla profits outperform my btc.. :( I should have split crypto - stock 50-50.
@_date: 2019-06-24 10:08:53
Why that ? Started to buy in March
@_date: 2019-04-21 11:01:44
Kraken from France was perfect. I imagine it's the same for Germany. Low fees, fast verification id.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:20:05
It's not time to sell. No hype yet, the average Joe isn't aware until 50k$.
@_date: 2019-04-15 08:58:04
Director of Paypal said could reach 1M$ in 7-10 years, so 100k is pretty cheap right ?
@_date: 2019-04-25 09:34:57
Haha good laugh in the comments of the video

Btc looking good right now
@_date: 2019-04-15 12:41:02
I have some questions and sorry if it's dumb but I have some troubles to understand.
* Do you buy bitcoin in order to not experience hyperinflation ? What if bitcoin crash and drop its price a lot ? Wouldnt be worse than hyperinflation ?
* I see you have some issues with electricity so in case of a general shutdown for several days you can't access your money right ? Don't you fear this ?
* You said in a comment that a lot of people don't know existence of bitcoin or fear to buy bitcoin, isn't more convenient to use another fiat currency ? Why people still use the Bolivares instead of USD$ ? If you are paid in BS you can exchange your paycheck in $ no ?

Bitpanda is annoying for verification id you need to do a video call for 10min.... And after I did my call my account wasn't verified after 15days. I contacted them and they told me to do it again. So bye bitpanda.. also they have too much fees.
 
Kraken was perfect tho.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:57:03
No it's still available it's just that I used kraken once for buy a good amount and it was perfect at that time. But I'm sure it's still perfect !

Sideway day
@_date: 2019-04-21 11:00:58
I don't recommend them for the annoying verification id and the fees.
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:55:27
No, i think BTC will go above 10k$ sooner than we expect.

Kraken has low fees but is not very user friendly when you are new.
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:45:29
At what price do you think " yup, this is moon" ?
