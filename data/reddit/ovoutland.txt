WalterCoin is issued by Walter White, and is backed by 7,000,000 pounds of blue meth, escrowed in a secure storage facility.

I use it because when the next frenzy hits, I can translate my coins into $ in one minute. Log in, sell, profit. For me, there's as much risk that Bitcoin could crash and my coins could be worthless, wherever I put them, as there is that Coinbase could crash and lose them.

For "until government tells them to"
Sounds legit!

You can take a look at the free sample on Amazon, and determine that yourself :)

This. I've made a $500 investment while I research BC for a novel, to "keep it interesting." I treat it like any other slot machine (I live in Nevada, and I know how they work). Whether it's Wall Street, Bitcoin, or an actual slot machine, *only put in what you're prepared to lose*. In five years BC could be the head-slapping "why o why didn't I get in on the ground floor of that," or the MySpace of cryptocurrencies...

Thanks, yeah I was hoping for an option within the exchange account.

Congrats! I knew they were rolling it out to select users, sounds like it's going wider...can't wait to get that email myself.

I would think BC would be the *least* attractive currency given its volatility. The coins have to be first purchased *with cash,* and there's a high risk, especially right now, that a significant amount of value could be lost between the time they're bought and the time they're either spent or cashed out again. 
Yeah, if you're hauling in millions of dollars in oil revenue every day, you may be willing to risk, say, buying BC at $500 and having it be worth $300 a week later, because of the portability advantage. But that's an awfully high potential cost to launder/transfer some money.

It might work, if there was a sort of (no pun intended) bit.ly that you could use, to create a shortened version of your address that people could use to Google you more easily.

Thanks, I'm on Coinbase but I didn't see any options for this, just the option to schedule buys every x amount of time. I didn't see anything in the help pages. I'll keep looking.

Lots of large corporations are audited by outside firms... Yes people can hold coins on wallets, but for wider acceptance it needs to be easier to manage and harder to lose coins. Otherwise Bitcoin is in the position that Linux was in, something nearly impossible for normal non technically proficient users to install and use. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 19:09:29
True, and maybe one of the existing insurers will step in there... Again, I think that might lead to more legitimacy for the currency.
@_date: 2015-10-21 12:24:33
That's true, now. It wasn't a few years back. You'd "simply" have to unpack the tarball and etc. etc... There was no simple executable package and there was a general, sorry, eye rolling impatience with ordinary PC users, who had to have an easy install before they'd implement it. My point is that as long as the ability to use a technology is exclusive to highly technically proficient people, it's not a game-changing or world-changing idea. Once Linux became easy to install, adoption increased...

I'm researching a novel in which the quest for the "Satoshi Hoard" is the plot driver. Buying BC gave me a stake that made the research "personal" and (these days) exciting.
