Not sure about that.. sending apple back an obviously intentionally destroyed iphone would be the cherry on top of the protest.

They're just being separated into glass and metal for easier recycling.

But then there's a chance someone else will use them and inevitably apple will get money from a new sucker somehow. The evil needs to be abolished, not passed on to those too ignorant to know any better.

"near" being the operative word. It's enough of a step in the right direction that I give it my full undivided support. But it's only a step in the right direction for the simple reason of it's deflationary nature. This makes it  susceptible to manipulation by few and (assuming it's dominance) inevitably will lead to the have's being able to have more and the have not's continuing to get what they can. Currency issued should reflect the productivity of the populace that it represents, and as much how just the decentralization is such a huge step forward and we should all rally behind it - it doesn't address that fundamental issue. Still, btc works wonderfully as a reserve level (as the susceptibility to manipulation decreases at a factor of the amount of points involved) but i worry about the point when nations start accepting them to pay taxes

To allow it to expire is one thing but how long they've let it go is getting ridiculous. Combine that with the ozcoin drama and they're losing me for one.

bitcoin will only remain anonymous as long as software remains unable to parse patterns in the blockchain

They're irretrievable and thereby out of circulation decreasing supply.

I'm pretty sure the federal government doesn't pay for any of those. You should look into how much of US taxation goes into paying interest to a private company to 'borrow' currency the government should just issue itself. Bitcoins shouldn't be any countries federal currency, it's deflationary and not flexible enough for that purpose. But it would be a huge improvement for the global reserve currency over the USD.
