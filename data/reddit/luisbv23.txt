Yes they need it more, you're right, we all have our struggles but we need too think about the less fortunates.

I don't want to sound greedy but i would gladly accept anything, here in Colombia I still havent found a way to buy, nor Paypal or credit card and only shady sellers with cash.

I bought a camera and some equipment when btc was at 6800 aprox.

I know.. kinda dumb, but with everyone in panic we must not forget what brought us here, for me it was the ability to buy stuff that are overpriced in my country, from any part of the world without dealing with credit cards and absurd fees (BTC has fees, but way fewer that buying with credit card over time).

My strategy is to buy when i want to, spend when i want to and never sell. And leave something to hodl.

Agree, this so-called war is bad for Crypto in general. Let's try being informed no matter the side you're in, and why not both?

I bought a Wacom drawing tablet with BTC two days ago in purse.io, and it was delivered with no issues! I want to hodl some but i want to use a little bit of the profits.. next purchase a mirrorless camera to start a mini studio!

I actually get a little bit more but no confirmations in 10 hours...
Edit: Confirmed now (20+ hours later)

I've paid 50 satoshis in mycellium and I don't feel robbed.

Nice, I live in Colombia and yesterday I won 15mBTC betting on the score.

I'm so bad at conversions!

What its FUD?

I bought a camera, a tripod and a Wacom tablet with Bitcoin.

The thing is people here fall easy on every ponzi scheme that exist, because in 3rd world countries everyone is looking for that golden ticket out of poverty and debt... and the first time bitcoin was mencioned on national TV was when a website (Mecoin)  was "hacked" and people lose their coins.

This. Thanks. Here in Colombia bitcoin has been 'satanized' and known as a pyramid scheme because of trading sites.
