Yes but on average people probably withdraw from an atm once every 5 days. If people did the same with bitcoin, it wouldn't work. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:01:22
Yes. And it was never illegal.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:48:07
I'd dare them to enforce that. Scandinavia is not a place where you want to terminate employees without cause

It has nothing to do with the amount of nodes. It's testing to make sure there are no bugs
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:47:11
I share your opinion, but I don't think it's the major cause.
The thing is with PoW is that it's flawed from the beginning. We need better more advanced solutions. A second layer on a broken foundation isn't a permanent solution. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:35:46
Sounds like we're pretty much in agreement then. I personally don't even own bitcoin for this very reason.
Even if LN becomes a success, I still don't think bitcoin or any PoW coin is sustainable.

@_date: 2018-01-17 19:51:16
Bullshit. You can't have the market to up like that without a major correction. The more noobs the bigger the panic selling is going to be
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:47:05
Common. You really can't see this has to do with the insane amount of capital that has been flowing into the market recently?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:03:18
That's not why. It's because the dollar is the world reserve currency and people have faith in it 
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:13:43
Because the topic is not about the valuation of bitcoin. It's about the crash. If you see a pattern of people cashing out around this time, it's logical to assume this was the major reason for this crash.
Sure that bitcoin is overvalued also plays a part. But even more so the weak hands that recently entered the market. Given how they pump vaporware, it's obvious their main concern is not about bitcoin's inflated value.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:49:31
Don't sell it. Especially not now. At least wait a month
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:30:29

@_date: 2018-01-18 10:57:33
You didn't read what I wrote. We've seen this correction around this time of year many times before. Surely you can't think the timing is coincidental.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:37:49
Yeah I get that. But I'm obviously talking about the opening and closing channels. If that's not something the average Joe won't do, then no problem. But the guy above used LN and a physical wallet as an anology. If people are going to open and close channels like they use an atm, it won't work 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:09:11

Which relates to bitcoin and the whole raise the blocksize debate that is still ongoing
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:48:34
Because the mempool would be clogged up if people used as often as they use an atm. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:35:22
Well I envision billions of people will one day use it. Which would work if 99% of them never open or closed a channel. That was my point. It's not that I don't understand it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:49:52
Sure bitcoin has problems. But that has little to do with this major correction. The new capital that has come in recently is mostly from noobs.  That's why all these shitcoins were surging. It was obvious this was about to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:42:16
Up 10%
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:35:55
If LN is like cash you hold in your wallet it will never work. Mainstream adaptation would not be possible 
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:23:55
Yes they can do this. But if they fire or reprimand any employee for it, it will cost them dearly. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:54:00
They got me at gold is not an investment 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:41:42
Yes that's what I'm saying. If the major causes for this crash were related to bitcoin's problems, it would have happened months ago. In fact, one of the major reason for bitcoins network clogging is this new capital that just came in to this market.
We've seen these crashes happen around this times for several consecutive years now. You'd be ignorant or delusional if you can't make that connection.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:25:44
Any major change is going to require a hard fork. I just don't see that happening. But never say never 
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:29:01
It's legal. But it's also something the unions can take to the labor court and most likely win. But they would have to reprimand or fire someone first I think.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:01:21
Not if you net it
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:36:24
It's regulated under the labor law. It's one thing to threaten employees, it's another carrying it out. Which I doubt they will as it will cost them a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:34:56
Yes it does. Except for the industrial use it also has
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:20:05

Sow tell me, how do you know this file doesn't contain already published information? What else could it possibly contain in your opinion?
Lastly, files do increase in size when you encrypt them and i was under the impression that it contained the cablegate data.

@_date: 2017-12-19 15:01:44
My bad, I confused you with someone else. There is no evidence that they did take such an action. From the newspaper that broke the story:
A few days after discovering the Syrian–Russian bank emails, one of RevoluSec’s principal hackers—the others often sought this individual’s permission before making any drastic moves—offered up another idea: “It’d be so funny to change some details on these mails and send a hundred million to WikiLeaks,” they said. “I know in theory it shouldn’t work, but they’re so stupid about email.”
So they're essentially saying the source could have omitted it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:52:31
Not again

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:48:53
Perhaps that was a reason. I can think of a few others as well. But even if we speculate and say that was the reason, it still doesn't support your initial claim he doesn't support Wikileaks. 
Not sure how pointing that out is sidestepping. I also don't know what FBPI means.

From the article: "The Russian cache was eventually quietly published online elsewhere, to almost no attention or scrutiny". So perhaps there was nothing to the story. U.S media didn't publish it either. To this day wikileaks hasn't retracted a single release. No information they have released has been proven false. Nice try though. You people really want to find a link there.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:10:11

First of all, nobody meddled in your election. Secondly, that Assange did is quite silly. Should he have waited to after the election to leak DNC corruption and Hillary collusion you mean? Using the same logic FBI meddled more in your election than any other.
He is in this subredit because Wikileaks was one of the first organizations to accept bitcoin. Even Satoshi personally wrote to them. They are also trying to disrupt the same corrupt system we are. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:07:00
The drug related violence you have is mainly from gangs that profit off the illegal market. When prohibition ended the gangsters just switched business. Today they are pretty much wiped out. Takes a while to break down. First step though is to not give them markets they can thrive in.
Legalization of pot is a step in the right direction. Less money for the criminals. More money for the state due to taxes and less policing, incarceration and trials. Better products for the end user. Total win win.

You should read your own sources. The first link is an encrypted file that the password was going to get released in case something happened to them before the public release of cablegate. Everything in there has been released today.
The second link is about Domscheit-Berg who splintered out of wikileaks because he thought wikileaks released too much.
The third link is about the same guy and how he stole thousands of documents from Wikileaks and destroyed them.
The irony is that you accuse me of not reading.

Well the thing is people will still do drugs whether they are legal or not. If they were all legal we can put the money on rehabilitation instead of incarceration. Which is what they do in Portugal and The Netherlands. Although it's only decriminalized there, not legalized.

He spent over a month with a wikileaks member, together in a room without shower and windows at the Moscow airport after the release. So that aspect clearly doesn't hold any water. 
That he chooses to criticize wikileaks once in a tweet obviously does not mean he somehow now holds a grudge or refuses to cooperate with them. If that were the case he would probably have said so outright instead of praising them before the one sentence critique.

So let me get this straight. They publish compromising info on a Russian ally instead of just ignoring it. Then they leave out one email on purpose out of gigs of data?

You see the first sentence in the first article? They use the word apparently. Nowhere in the article are they claiming they have proof of this. Stop lying. 
A gem from the dailydot article: A few days after discovering the Syrian–Russian bank emails, one of RevoluSec’s principal hackers—the others often sought this individual’s permission before making any drastic moves—offered up another idea: “It’d be so funny to change some details on these mails and send a hundred million to WikiLeaks,” they said. “I know in theory it shouldn’t work, but they’re so stupid about email.”
Well that seems like a plausible explanation.

He created it because he wanted to change the world for the better. Once a community was built around it and it started gaining traction he left it at the hands of the people. He could have thrown the keys away at that very moment and continued his life not telling anyone.

When the US empire crumbles, the US dollar will only be worth the paper it's printed on. That's when having 1 btc is being a millionaire

The same consus that consistently fails to predict bubbles and that is bringing us closer and closer to a complete economic collapse.

The bigger the block size the more it benefits the big whales with lots of computational power. So they want us to compromise democracy and liberty for a half baked solution that is just a temporary fix for the scaling problem. 
They do that under the guise of improving btc but in reality what they want is more control and profits

Wikileaks has published leaks on Russia. Democrats had no problem with wikileaks when Bush was president when they released lots if damming info on him. 
Thanks to wikileaks we know that the dnc conspired with Hillary. Time to end the corrupt two party system once and for all.

This has happened to me too even though I have a verified account. Best thing is to create a support ticket and then go to their slack channel and ask them to action it right away
Problem is though they are now limiting people from joining their slack. Also the slack channel is now full with unresolved requests. 
I think many exchanges have this problem as they are seeing such an increase of users and their support department can't handle it.

Do you call CBC and BBC propaganda too? Looks like it's you who are subjected to propaganda. I suggest you learn critical thinking and don't let your government and media tell you what to believe

You should if you had the btc on a private key. Google it

Depends on the coin that is going take over. And by that a technically more advanced coin. Not a pumped shit coin like Bcash

They are either full of shit or lying or both.  Take Amazon stocks for example. They don't call that a bubble even though they are not making a profit. Yet when we buy bitcoin believing it will be used as a replacement for the usd in the future they think we're crazy.

I would expect a dip normally too. But for the reasons mentioned by OP above I don't think that dip will be big.

The whole block size debate is not about cheaper transactions.  It's about centralization and it's an attack against everything btc stands for. So no. It's not elegant. Other coins are already trying to solve this and we don't have to assume that btc ever will. We should support decentralized currencies. Which is what the market will eventually do. Sakamoto surely understood this.
