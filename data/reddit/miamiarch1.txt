Appreciate the advice! I'll give it another day or so before reconsidering an accelerator.

Thanks Donte.  Was it ViaBTC or PushTX that you have experience with? I don't have an issue with using a paid accelerator service as long as it is legit.
What happens in the event this rollercoaster continues and it does not confirm?  I've heard everything from mempool clearing in 72 hours (at which point it would be refunded to the original wallet) to node's rebroadcasting the transaction resulting in the tx getting stuck in a perpetual loop.

I wouldn't consider it gone, you just might be waiting a while.  I'm sure the above advice applies to your situation as well.
I believe it'll all blow over soon enough.

Figured as much. Oh well, thanks anyway!

Yeah, it’s a bit concerning they aren’t making more headway through the backlog. Hopefully in a day or two it’ll die down.

Yep, never seen any sort of minimum before with GDAX.

Thanks man.  Unfortunately I am running on MultiBit Classic, not sure if Electrum will be supporting that same feature on such an old wallet.  As long as I export my private keys from said wallet, I should be able to import to Electrum regardless of what version of MultiBit I have?
Like I said I'm out of town at the moment so it looks like I'll have to have a buddy swing by my place and export them for me.  I transferred from Coinbase to MB years ago, I just never exported private keys.  I was under the impression that if they were in a wallet, they were secure.  Looks like it's back to the drawing board for me.

Seriously, read about the discontinued support for MultiBit from here on out and it's disconcerting.  Unfortunately I am out of town at the moment and don't have access to my current wallet, otherwise I would be transferring as we speak.  Are you going to roll the dice and keep them in MB, or do you plan on switching wallets prior to the fork?

Looking for the same answer brother.  Any luck?

Thank you so much. I wasn't necessarily worried about MB being shady or anything, it was more about them being compatible after the fork.  They had yet to confirm anything, and then reading about them dropping support just made me even more nervous.  I was terrified I'd open the wallet post hard fork and something would fail/be incompatible/lose funds, etc.  
Thanks again for the help man, I truly appreciate it!

Thank you, unfortunately I was looking for information specific to MultiBit Classic. My worry was if I didn't export my private keys prior to the fork, something may have gotten lost. It seems like from the other comments here, that I will be fine as long as they are in the wallet right now and I should be safe exporting my keys after the fork. Am I correct in assuming that?

Thanks man! I am traveling at the moment and was going to have a friend run by my place and export my keys prior to the fork. Sounds like that won't be necessary and I can do it when I return. Appreciate the help!
