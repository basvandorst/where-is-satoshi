True. Recognizing the (very controversial) consequences of centralized banking is important, but it shouldn't be a barrier to adoption.
Switching over to Bitcoin and having trustworthy centralized organizations (such as Coinbase) is still a huge improvement over the existing system.

This is entirely correct. All it takes is a general consensus of the majority of the miners to make it happen (or a forked block chain). It's not unlike how the Fed works to determine the money supply.
In my opinion, a static 25 BTC forever would be acceptable. It strikes a good balance between those that say in a million billion years the deflation will doom us all, and those that say in a million billion years inflation will doom us all. I am of the thought that after another few halflings of the reward, transaction fees will totally eclipse it and no one will even care what the reward is.

While I agree the wording of this is alarmist; when you receive the private key with some BTC on it, there is no way to know that the guy who gave it to you doesn't still have the private key too. You want to move it to your own account ASAP. If you don't, it's like getting a bank cheque but not cashing it.
The analogy of paper cheques works pretty well for people who aren't interested in (and usually don't care about) the way BTC works.

For this to be damaging, all of the following would have to be true:
* Users would have to be unaware the internet was partitioned. Otherwise they would simply know that they couldn't trust any transactions, no matter how many confirmations pass.
* Someone would have to double-spend coins in both partitions of the internet. You could still sign transactions in the smaller bitcoin network; they would just not get signed into the blockchain until they were reconnected.
* The partition would have to be permanent. If not, then when they join back together, all nodes simply start using the higher blockchain, and all of those transactions from the previous blockchain (that weren't double-spends) would just roll into new blocks.
I suppose such a thing could happen in a place like the DPRK. But even if the smaller partition has something crazy like 5% of the computing power, you're going to see new block confirmations every 3 hours for the first week until the difficulty recalibrates, and everyone will know something's up. And then when the difficulty drops, everyone will REALLY know something's up.
If such a thing were to happen, I'd bet the DPRK would just start some altcoin like DOGE until they came back into contact with the rest of the world; but that's getting a little speculative :)

Vote with your feet. When a merchant offers a choice between Bitcoin and Dollars, pay with the former.
Also, it makes a ton of money for your merchant. They're getting charged around 3% for the transaction. Depending on the industry and volume, they could be operating at a markup of like 15% and you just boosted that to 18%. It's literally giving them a 20% raise.

The same can be said of the current credit card system; most people can be willfully ignorant of how the merchant, the payment gateway, the payment processor/aggregator, the credit card network, and a bank are all involved in a credit card transaction. Nobody really cares, and merchants just kind of bend over and take the 3% fee off the bottom line. I don't think fully understanding the system is necessary to use it.

Governments have historically been bad about totally shutting out communications. Monitoring traffic, such as what the US does, is easy because the people have no idea it happens. Going around a firewall with a VPN is pretty trivial common in countries that have tried to censor the internet, like Iran and China.
You are correct on the last point though! Lots of blind down-voting.
An interesting attack, however, would be to silently amass a majority in computing power inside your geographic area (lets say it's all in Nigeria, but nobody is aware of it). You wouldn't need to control or own it; just own the means of communication through your boundaries. As we've said, easier said than done... but lets just say you could do it. Then you could have 51% of the computing power, cut yourself off, then buy a whole bunch of shit from Overstock, wait the 2-3 hours for 6 confirmations, and in the mean time, inside your own borders you double-spend it and send it to yourself. Then you reconnect your country, and your higher blockchain takes over. I guess at that point, Overstock would have no choice but to void your obviously fraudulent order to Nigeria and be slightly annoyed. :P

Of course MongoDB has its advantages, and it has its drawbacks. A lack of atomic commits across multiple documents is one of them. They could be built on top of it with some sort of semaphore locking mechanism, but that's doing it the hard way, fitting a square peg into a round hole.

I'd actually like to play the devil's advocate here;
That $1000 she originally invested? Don't take it out because she doesn't want to lose it. If she's afraid of losing it, she shouldn't invest it in the first place. The moment you invest in something as volatile as bitcoin, you should consider that money gone.
Psychologically it can seem like a good idea, however a lot of traders in traditional markets will caution you away from it because *it doesn't matter how much you start with*. Your holdings are worth what they're worth now. Better to leave your investments invested, and take it out when you need money for a personal expense, or perhaps you think Bitcoin itself is no longer a good investment. Take action when something changes, but have a reason for it.
To put things another way, consider if you bought $1000 worth at $20/BTC, then 3 months later they're trading $40/BTC. You decide "hey, I'm going to sell half of my BTC and take out my original $1000 investment, that way I can never lose it". Now it's $200/BTC, you've got $6000. Had you stayed all the way in, you would be at $10,000. You missed out on $4000.
Bitcoin is a highly volatile "investment". You should only invest what you can afford to lose. Emotionally distance yourself from your investments. That original $1000 she invested? As soon as she converted it into Bitcoin, she should consider it gone.

Because the owner of the Bitcoin is anyone who knows the private key. The owner is a person who can spend it.
Think of the private key as the password to a temporary bank account. Think of the public key as the account number. The bank (i.e. the bitcoin network) all agrees that the account number has a certain amount of money associated to it. Only the/a person who knows the password for the account is able to create transactions for it.

Something like this could definately be done. It would have security risks similar to how paper cheques have your account number printed at the bottom in micr ink.
A QR code of the private key (not hidden by a scratch-off covering) could be printed, presumably with "0.01 BTC" printed next to it. Anyone with a phone could verify that that QR code has that amount of funds in it... however anyone who verifies it could also spend it, so you have to be very careful who you show it to. When you "Spend" the QR code (by handing it to someone), they *should* immediately cash it.
In some ways, it's better than a cheque (the user can verify that the paper has bitcoin backing it on the spot, and doesn't have to deposit it at the bank). In other ways, it's worse (if the spender spends it elsewhere before you cash it, it will bounce, but with a cheque you can keep trying to cash it. With this you're SOL).
It definately introduces a lot of **very very bad security issues**, however it could work if you trust the person to take an IOU from them, it could work. Traditional cheques worked very well for the world for 40 years, and those are essentially IOUs.

Remember, you're not giving them the "password" to your primary wallet. You're creating a new wallet, and only putting the money you intend on giving them in that wallet. And as soon as they can, they are taking the money out of that wallet and putting it in their own primary wallet.

I don't mine anymore, but from what I remember, I had to have BitcoinQT on my mining machine. Pool mining is just like normal mining. When you mine for a block, you have a "payout address" (your own) associated to the hashes you try. If the hash comes out as a valid block, then you submit it to the network and the payout address is granted 25 BTC. Normally you'd throw away all of your bad blocks. In a mining pool, you mine with the pool's payout address instead of your own. A bad block can still be submitted to the pool for a share of credit. Finding a good block will send 25 BTC to the pool's address, and everyone with shares gets a share. Note: this requires you to trust the pool to pay you :)

**Bitcoin is not anonymous**. In fact, since the entire ledger of every transaction ever made since its inception is publicly replicated, it's probably the least anonymous system ever created. Various systems have already been devised to figure out, with a relatively high degree of certainty, who a lot of addresses belong to. These transactions aren't going anywhere, either; they don't get archived off to tape and paper like your bank transactions from 12 months ago do. Future yet-to-be-invented data mining methods that take advantage of 1000-core processors that load the entire blockchain into RAM some decades from now will be able to figure it out.
If you want to be anonymous, buy your drugs with cash USD.

You don't want to accidentally screw up and you want to make sure you have the ability to later take money out of the paper wallet you put them into.
Treat your Bitcoin like cold hard cash, and you don't have any sort of insurance. If it's stolen, the cops are going to be worthless, too (SSDD). There are no chargebacks, either; everything is permanent. If you pay the wrong person, and send money to an unknown address, you've basically lost it forever. The banking industry can be fairly predatory sometimes, but for their steep fees they do actually provide some services that we take for granted.
If you're holding onto considerable BTC, keep it in a safe place. A good rule of thumb is the hardware it resides on should be worth more than the Bitcoin contained within; for example, I don't like to keep more than 0.1 BTC on my phone. You wouldn't walk around with $500 in your pocket, would you?

It merely appears that way because PHP plasters its extension at the end of all the URLs, and for a time it was the norm before "HTML5/Web 2.0" was a thing. These days, PHP is basically just Wikipedia and Wordpress. Facebook too, but they use a heavily modified variant of it.

Negative. They are simply re-transmitting the new blocks they hear about to all their friends. Verifying a block is just doing a single hash, so it's cheap (in terms of CPU) and anyone can do it. Relatively speaking, if verifying a block takes a 10th of a second, then mining a block takes a few million years, because you're doing a few trillion hashes before you find one.

Something like this? 
As far as I can tell, the problem is this: You have to trust the person who put the scratch-off sticker over the private key that there is indeed a private key under it.
Also, creating scratch-off things isn't possible from a standard printer.

Step 1: Install [BitcoinQT]( Let it sync up (do this overnight, it takes a while, and takes like 11 gigs of space, since you're getting yourself a copy of the entire transaction ledger). Send your Bitcoin to yourself.
Step 2: Backup your wallet.dat file into a secure flash drive.

Bandwidth speeds have historically gone up exponentially. The cost of storage has also gone down exponentially. The blockchain, however, grows linearly. It's not a big enough problem for anyone to do much about now, and there's a high likelihood that we won't ever have to deal with it.

I have heard good things about Electrum. From what I know about it, it is certainly secure. I believe it relies on a server though, to make transactions; however you own your private keys and they aren't on the server, so that should make it safe. It does seem like a good alternative client if you don't want a 12-gig blockchain on your drive.
I simply haven't tried it, though, so I really shouldn't speak positively or negatively about it. :)

You're right, A $1000 BTC isn't unrealistic. It's easy to say that it will never happen now, though; they are the same people who said a 20 was unrealistic when it was 1$/BTC. And then they said 200 was unrealistic when it was 15$/BTC.
I personally expect it to jump to $1000, and then fall to $500, and I'm being conservative. This is how speculator bubbles work.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:25:05
I'm not exactly positive on this bit, but I believe clients must be upgraded after a certain amount of time. I think there's some negative consequence, like people in the network won't listen to you because your software is old. Your BTC is still fine, but you won't be able to push a transaction to spend it without a newer client.
The limit is there for a reason, though, as you said. I guess if the average amount of bandwidth and CPU that any given node has went up, then they would raise it.
Full disclosure, again: I'm not an expert. I'm just an enthusiast, and I could be spreading misinformation here.

Rubbing a magnet over it isn't good, but it isn't necessarily bad. The head reads the bits in relative differences along the platter. The magnet "pulls" them all in one direction, but the differences are still there.
For example, visualize it like this. You've got a long string of "+1"s and "-1"s. The +1s are charged in one direction (with a magnitude of 1), and the -1s are charged in the opposite direction. When you run the magnet over it, you've pulled them both "up", so you've now got "+5"s and "+3"s. There's still a relative difference of "2" in the charge.

A node is (probably) someone running Bitcoin-QT (or at least bitcoind). They have a verified copy of the entire 12-gig blockchain, and are actively verifying and re-transmitting transactions as well as new blocks mined. They also, usually, have a wallet, and can create their own transactions.
Not all nodes are miners, but all miners must also be nodes. A miner wants to be mining from the most current block, otherwise any blocks he or she finds will be worthless.
7 transactions per second is a throttle imposed by the node software. Transactions still need to be verified and transmitted. These are relatively small, but hypothetically if 7 a second takes 1% of your resources, 700 would take 100% of your resources and overwhelm the nodes and bad things would happen.
