To bitcoin development, a country's border is not relevant. There will never be a code change that addresses behavior for a specific country. Because of this, any discussion of such things are off-topic for the core development discussion channel. Translation into various languages is already well supported, and is as noncontroversial as you can get.
Feel free to do a translation into any language you know. The developers will give you their gratitude for it.

It is not speculation at all to claim that consuming more resources will result in fewer viable users. For a given level of resource consumption, the number of viable machines is reduced when the resource consumption increases.


Based on the complaints I see regularly on irc, people *definitely* notice the size of the blockchain. Current sync time is maybe six to eight hours. At this size, it's easy enough to say "leave it running overnight, and don't worry about it". If this was 24 hours, it would be much harder for users to swallow "just don't use your computer for 24 hours, and don't worry about it."


As jgarzik said above, it is important that block space be a limited resource. Competition (demand) for a limited resource increases the value of the resource. If block space is not scarce, people won't have any incentive to pay anything substantial for it. Otherwise, the same reasoning would apply to the value of bitcoins, and we should just let people generate as many as they want for maximum bitcoin market cap.

there are several devs that are happy to field questions from anyone interested.
if you want to test your understanding, check out the mailing list. as you are able to follow more developer discussions, you will be able to gauge to what degree you can contribute. 
you should start by thinking about the bitcoin system, and ensuring you understand how it works. you will find that it is quite an intricate, multifaceted, thoughtfully created system. in my not so humble opinion, bitcoin is on the forefront of software systems technology. never before would anyone have even though such a system is even possible.
most economics academics think bitcoin is a ridiculous joke. they tend to make trivially disprovable assertions such as "bitcoin has no value", and "nothing can be used for a currency without prior intrinsic value". one of the more interesting aspects of bitcoin is understanding the deep-rooted cognitive dissonance traditional economists have towards it.

Without proof-of-work, bitcoin doesn't exist. You're essentially proposing that everyone abandon bitcoin and use mastercard or visa. Feel free to start your own altcoin that doesn't rely on proof of work, but good luck finding some way to make zero-trust work without it. It is very difficult for a decentralized system to come to a consensus as to what order events occur. Without proof of work to distribute the decision making widely, and make reordering very difficult, one has no other choice than to trust a central authority to dictate the official sequence of transactions. This is the same as a traditional centralized payment system such as mastercard or paypal.


Reintroducing the block reward makes bitcoin inflationary, which lowers value. This would make bitcoin less demanded, as anyone holding bitcoin would be losing value over time as more is perpetually generated. We want bitcoin to be highly valued, and a big part of the present value is based on speculation of a higher future value.
I think I understand the source of your opposition to fees, and I used to feel the same way. I wanted bitcoin to replace traditional currencies completely, and become *the* currency that everyone in the world uses. Such a scenario would be nice, but simply isn't possible given the constraints of decentralization.
Consider an alternate future for bitcoin, where it is used for a fewer number of high-valued transactions instead of a massive number of low-valued ones. There are many high-value transactions performed globally where significantly higher fees than 0.005 btc are completely acceptable. I am taking the perspective that this is bitcoin's future market. Sufficient decentralization cannot exist if everyone has to validate every other human's breakfast, lunch, and dinner payment transactions. If a transaction is 250 bytes on average, and half of the world's ten-billion population makes three transactions per day, the daily increase in blockchain size is 3.4 terabytes. This is 1.2 petabytes per year. Not even remotely sustainable for a decentralized system that is to run on commodity hardware.
Everyone's lunch purchases will have to be handled using some other payment method, such as local currency. It just isn't sustainable to try to make bitcoin serve such use cases.

Bimetalism attempts to e.g. establish a fixed amount of gold to be equivalent to a fixed amount of silver. This is equivalent to setting a price ceiling or floor, which of course is unstable.
Bitcoin having a 21M bitcoin limit as well as a 1MB block limit isn't similar at all. It doesn't mean that 21M bitcoin is worth 1MB of transactions per block. I don't know what that would even mean...
The value of a bitcoin and the value of a transaction are orthogonal in the current implementation.
The value of 21M bitcoin is set based on supply and demand of bitcoin at a particular time.
The value (fee) of a transaction is set based on supply and demand of block space.
Interesting idea, but I don't think it applies to the discussion at hand.

Only half of my fears are at all related to the block reward. Reduced decentralization as a result of a large blockchain has nothing to do with the block reward.
As I said below, if the network isn't decentralized enough, and a DOS attack is able to disrupt the bitcoin network for an extended period of time, all confidence in the system's viability will be forever lost. All of the people arguing that bitcoin is just a bunch of worthless numbers will be completely correct without a resilient network that facilitates transferring them.


If the block reward is secondary to fees, then miners will have incentive to pack as many fee-carrying transactions (regardless of how small) into blocks as the block size permits. The block size limit is what forces them to discern.


Dust spamming works at the moment because the block space is roomy enough to permit it. Block space is the only thing that places pressure on miners to not include spam like satoshi dice transactions. Most miners will include any fee carrying transaction if the block size permits it.
Miners will never choose to forego any fees (even tiny fees) due to an altruistic desire to keep blockchain bloat down. The blocks they are lucky enough to solve are their bread and butter, and they will pack them full, future be damned.


You're saying that once miners depend on fees for their income, it will be a good idea to increase the block size? Increasing block size at this point will *reduce fees*. This is akin to saying to diamond miners that because demand for diamonds has driven up the value of their product, they should flood the market with diamonds. Diamond miners restrict the supply of diamonds because they make more profit when the supply is constrained relative to demand. Increasing the block size after miners depend on fees could be *devastating* to the hashrate.

I don't know any hobbyists that have 17 Terabytes (4000 * current 4.4GB) of storage laying around.
Also note that running a full node doesn't pay anything. Miners may be able to afford it, but for the most resilience we need a lot more full nodes than mining nodes. Expecting there to be a massive number of people that want to upgrade their storage for no return on their investment doesn't seem reasonable.
Also note that as bitcoin matures, it will need a much larger number of nodes than it currently has. So if the cost to run a full node grows linearly with the current fixed block size, and storage/processing grows exponentially, the number of people who can painlessly run a full node will increase exponentially. It may at some point be feasible for every computing device to be a full node, making any kind of attack on the network laughable. This is the kind of resilience bitcoin needs to be worthy of arbitrary levels of trust.
If just one DDOS is able to disrupt the bitcoin network for an extended period of time, the gig is up.

It's all about zero-trust. The full blockchain allows a client to know it has irrefutable proof of all balances in the system. With a verified and up-to-date blockchain, any single node is capable of functioning as an autonomous entity.
The blockchain is required only to the extent that you distrust the parties you are connected to.

f=0 is not an artificial constraint, it is the state that the system approaches. These problems aren't very significant for the short period of time where f is large (which is probably another reason why many people discount them at present while f is at its maximum), and become more prevalent as time passes. The blockchain size becomes increasingly unwieldy, and the hashrate loses its "free" funding. When discussing how to facilitate long term stability, it seems appropriate to consider how things will work as f shrinks.
So as f approaches zero in the long term, g(b) must be greater than or equal to F. Fees need upward pressure for this to happen, which constrained block space induces.
As far as b being constant, I think this allows for maximum decentralization by allowing technology growth to dwarf the system's requirements. With a system that depends so heavily upon confidence, maximum reliability seems like a reasonable goal. Allowing b to grow over time will just reduce the hashrate and decentralization. V(b,f) will certainly not be maximized if a five-million-node botnet dosses the network for a week.
PoS sounds pretty interesting, as you can probably tell I haven't heard much about it until now. I'll check it out :)

Anyone who wants a high hashrate. As the block reward continues to dwindle, the hashrate will basically be proportional to the fees paid.

Transaction fees should be set based on supply and demand of block space because, if we value decentralization, block space is a limited resource. The only reasonable way to allocate limited resources is to provide the resources in a market where people have the ability to place bids in accordance with the importance of the resource to them.
Transaction fees act as a market-based way to allocate block space based on who needs it the most. This approach assumes that people who need to send the most will be willing to pay the highest fees, which makes a lot of sense.
Fees serve the dual purpose of both rationing block space *and* preventing double spends by sustaining the hashrate. As stated in the OP, bitcoin needs both in order to remain secure both from DOS attacks and double spend attacks.
Bitcoin users can't be expected to include a transaction fee just to keep the hashrate up, because their primary motivation is to send bitcoin as inexpensively as possible. Besides, users don't have any way of even knowing what hashrate the network should have to be secure in the first place. They won't know if the hashrate is high enough to be secure, so they can't be expected to err on the side of caution and be generous with their bitcoin "just in case".
Tying the hashrate to block space demand conveniently ties the bitcoin user's desire to send bitcoin to mining income so that the network will be secure.

I think what will *actually* happen, is that v0.9 or so will start up instantly as a light client, and then "slow jam" (with saxes, etc) the rest of the data required to be a full node.
Presumably the user will have a choice about the amount and rate of resource consumption.
If the bitcoin network can benefit from a large number of users sharing whatever spare change resources they don't mind parting with, it could be very resilient against attacks.
Bitcoin is kind of like a voluntary democracy. In exchange for the freedom it grants us, we are in charge of taking initiative and ensuring it doesn't end up in a ditch. Running a full node (i.e. double-clicking something and ignoring it) is a pretty easy way to put in your vote of confidence.
tl;dr The reference client developers know how important leveraging and managing user resources is, and I'm confident they will make good decisions to solve these problems.

A service like WU using individual bitcoin transactions to transfer value between branches city to city, or country to country, is perfectly suited to bitcoin's current design.
Using bitcoin as an intermediary for currency conversions to send value between two places would amount to a major shift for bitcoin, effectively offloading bitcoin transactions from the blockchain, and into fiat systems.
This is the kind of thing that MUST happen for bitcoin to grow in use and value, while not giving up decentralization in favor of bloated block sizes.

It isn't as simple as just increasing the block size to 200MB to match VISA's transaction volume. Blocks have to propagate across the network very quickly relative to the 10-minute block period, or the network starts having convergence problems.
Nobody knows at what size problems occur. But the closer to capacity the network operates at normally, the easier it will become for an attacker to push it over the edge.
We'll learn a lot after May 15 when 1MB blocks start floating by regularly.

The rate of issuance of bitcoin decreases over time, regardless of the power of the mining devices that people use.
So while asics are likely decreasing the number of miners, they are as a whole fighting for a smaller and smaller amount of bitcoin.

The fixed block size was absolutely not removed. There was a 250000 byte default soft limit to the size of blocks that would be created that most miners never changed. The backlog of unconfirmed transactions was growing, and many blocks were at that soft limit, so Gavin Andresen suggested miners consider changing it (it is just a command line parameter): 
There is a hard limit of 1000000 bytes that every node on the current network, including those running the latest experimental builds, currently (and will for the foreseeable future) reject outright as invalid. See line 28, committed by s_nakamoto in September 2009:

If four billion people used bitcoin to pay for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day, the blockchain would grow 2.8TB every day. This would break the system's decentralization, given that it would be impossible for the vast majority of users to run a full node.
Either we have a decentralized system with a high hashrate and low transaction volume (much like bitcoin is today), or we have a centralized (out of necessity) system with a low hashrate (no need for hashrate when centralized) and high transaction volume (see VISA, MASTERCARD, etc).

A central design goal of bitcoin is "zero trust", so any individual has all of the information they need to validate or reject a given transaction. Part of validating a transaction is ensuring that the bitcoin involved isn't counterfeit. To do this, the client must ensure that it was introduced in a legitimate block that the network accepted. It then ensures that every subsequent transfer is valid, until it ends up with the set of unspent outputs.
This set is essentially the totals of active addresses, and is (as you suspect) all that is necessary for a client to know if a new transaction is valid. But new clients require the full history to recreate this set without trusting any of the nodes it connects to.

Do you want a block chain that grows terabytes per day? Are you ready to go buy a new hard disk just to run a full node? Do you think the average bitcoin user is going to be ok with that?
If the block size limit persists, more and more devices will be capable of functioning as full nodes. Eventually hardware will outpace blockchain growth so much that every device will be able to act as a full node. The bitcoin network will be the most robust system that has ever existed, so will be fit to be trusted with more value than any system before it.
This decentralization is bitcoin's strength, and an unlimited block size undermines it.
You won't be paying for lunch with bitcoin, but you may be getting paid using it, or using it to store your retirement savings.

Just because a deflationary currency may pose a threat to government and banking income/control does not mean all arguments against it are manipulative lies.
The two big arguments here are 1) that the value will never be predictably stable, and 2) that incentives for investment, productivity, and general progress will be reduced.
The bottom line is that we do not know if a world based on a deflationary currency would indeed be better. I'm happy that it looks like we'll get to find out, though :)

I'm not blindly adhering to anything. I used to assume bitcoin could be used for everything, and after a lot of thought and discussion, I was able to understand that there is a more natural (and meaningful) fit for bitcoin in our society than as a VISA replacement.
I am arguing that bitcoin can't be used by everybody to purchase everything. The numbers in my example are an appropriate reflection of such a situation.
So given that we have to exclude some transactions, how might we do that in a way that preserves value in the system? 
You indicate that you don't want a system that requires people to pay for what they need, because it's unfair to people with fewer resources. How could such a ~free system ever work? Without fees, people will consume miner and node resources without any consideration of whether those other people's resources are worth a particular exchange. How are we to ensure responsible use of the network's resources if there is no meaningful cost to the users?
It is a potential tragedy of the commons. Currently in our society, how do we prevent wasteful people from consuming all of the resources? We allow supply and demand to set prices, so that people don't use what they don't need. It is the same situation with decentralized network resources.
Bitcoin can brush shoulders with big banks even if it is not used by everyone to buy lunch. If bitcoin were used for the 360,000 most valuable transactions each day, its deflationary properties alone would destroy the top-down debt-based inflationary hierarchy currently in use. The repercussions of this would be much more significant than the warm fuzzy feeling you get when you buy a coffee with bitcoin.
Trying to replace VISA with bitcoin is doomed to fail. We already have VISA, so what makes you think a decentralized implementation of VISA would be a Big Deal? Centralized systems designed from the ground up to handle huge transaction volume loads are (surprise!) well suited for everyday low-value, trust-insensitive transactions. They are much more well-suited than a system that has been designed to be as decentralized as possible (and 10 minute block delay?!).
Why not make high-value, trust-sensitive transactions bitcoin's primary target? The system's rules seem perfect for it. There is certainly a market for it. It could guarantee the systems viability long into the distant future.

Bicoin is a "consensus" system. The goal is for there to be clear consensus around exactly one blockchain.


The network was split between a new version, which unknowingly disagreed with prior versions about the validity of certain kinds of blocks, breaking consensus when a contested block was mined. One of these blocks was mined by an 0.8 miner, and the &lt;0.8 nodes (and miners) rejected it, while the 0.8 nodes/miners accepted it. The devs noticed, and quickly came up with a plan to regain consensus.


Only nodes that were directly connected to btcguild would see these blocks, and they would be ignored along with every block btcguild mined on top of such a block.

The number of hashes that are behind the blocks that confirm a transaction is what creates the resistance to double spending.
The miners are doing a particular number of hashes every hour, and in an hour's time the transaction will have the same security regardless of how many blocks deep it is.
In other words, if litecoin blocks happen twice as fast (and if litecoin's hashrate is equivalent to bitcoin's), then you need twice as many blocks to have the same protection against double spending.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:56:29


This is completely false. A pool can't just force a hard-forking change (like increased block size) on the entire bitcoin network without the support of all of the non-mining nodes as well.
Bitcoin isn't a democracy. If a pool with 99% of the hashrate started submitting blocks that were 1000001 bytes, every node would drop them immediately, and the hash power would be completely wasted.
@_date: 2013-02-06 16:04:40


This seems exactly the opposite of reality. The block subsidy reduces the motivation of miners to include transactions, because 99% of their income comes from the subsidy. Including zero transactions wouldn't impact them greatly.
But when the block reward shrinks, miners may get 99% of their income from transactions. This means they will be motivated to pack as many transactions as possible into their blocks. They will receive the fees, and the rest of the bitcoin network will be burdened with the massive block they created. Without a hard limit on block size, miners will have incentive to include each and every fee-carrying transaction that will fit.
So a single entity benefits, and everyone else shoulders the cost with very little benefit. This *is* the definition of the tragedy of the commons, despite how frequently that phrase may be misapplied.
Dust spam is currently viable because blocks aren't full. If blocks were full, dust spam would require prohibitively high fees.
The nice thing about cash is that there is no perpetual overhead for a transaction. Every bitcoin transaction that occurs becomes an immortal burden on every entity that wants to use bitcoin with zero trust. This is why it is justifiable to exclude low-value transactions. If only large organizations can afford the hardware to run a zero-trust full node, then the zero trust model is broken. We will be back to relying on large financial institutions to be able to transfer value around the world.
While it is true that bitcoin hasn't ever bumped up against the current limit, it is not true that it has hummed along fine. Initial sync times have grown greatly as the blockchain has been continually bloated with low fee transaction trash (largely from satoshi dice). Dramatic (and quite inconvenient... enjoy upgrading to 0.8) changes have had to occur because of scaling problems at less than a fourth of the 1MB limit. If the devs are able to restructure the system to preserve decentralization (and low cost zero-trust) even with larger blocks, then I would be thrilled to buy my lunch with bitcoin along with everyone else. This hasn't been the case so far, so my argument stands.
With a small block size limit, it is true that fees will be too high for some people to afford. But fees will never be so high that bitcoin is abandoned. To argue otherwise is essentially claiming that bitcoin will be used so much that nobody will use it. The truth is that usage will decrease if fees are too high, and increase if fees are too low. The network's resources will be used by those that need it the most (e.g. services like satoshi dice will be gone).
I am not entirely against changing the 1MB limit. A somewhat adaptive block size might have compelling benefits. We just need to ensure that running a full node is feasible for anyone, and that it becomes *more* feasible in time (as hardware grows in power), rather than less. We should ensure that we maintain or increase the decentralization that makes bitcoin unique.

I am guessing that the developers would mount a convincing argument to keep things as-is.
I think it would go something like this:
A small, fixed block size helps to address two of the main attacks that could be performed against bitcoin. The magnitude of protection necessary to be safe against these threats (double-spending and DDoS) is impossible to know in advance, but successful exploitation would have the potential to completely destroy confidence in bitcoin's viability. Erring on the side of caution with such an important project is probably wise.

Many people think bitcoin could be used by everyone in the world every day to pay for things.
But because of the hard block size limit, bitcoin cannot be used for more than about 360,000 transactions per day (about 2,500 transactions every 10 minutes).
Some sub-misconceptions:
* "The developers will increase the block size limit." But no, many of the developers recognize the block limit as a fundamentally important feature to sustain the hashrate and maximize decentralization.
* "Bitcoin is worthless with so few transactions!" But no, bitcoin may just be used for the ~360,000 most valuable financial transactions each day. Fees will necessarily go up until an equilibrium between miners and users is established. Pressure to exchange bitcoin without involving the blockchain (using a bitcoin-backed paper currency, for example) will increase as blocks begin to fill up.

I'm somewhat confident that the "txout merkle tree" approach will open things up. It's definitely a cool idea.
It would be a great thing to have implemented before usage starts to bump up against the limit, so that it can be safely raised.

@_date: 2013-04-07 03:35:37
They have gone up and down, but the bottom line is that they will eventually go up substantially. The market value adds a lot of noise to quantifying how fees are changing, but fixed block size will require direct competition between users for block space. When this happens, the minimum viable bitcoin transaction value will increase.

The current maximum block size is 1000000 bytes, which translates to about 4000 transactions every 10 minutes.
Once the transaction rate surpasses this limit, block space will be scarce relative to demand, and people will have to start competing for block space with their transaction fees.
The idea is that by the time the block reward decreases substantially, transaction fees will have grown to more than compensate miners for their continued effort.
For 4000 transactions to pay 25btc, each transaction would need to include 0.00625btc in fees. But we don't have to worry about compensating for the lost block reward for quite some time. The next reduction in block reward won't be for more than 3.5 years, after which transaction fees would need to compensate 12.5btc per block, or 0.003125btc each. I'm pretty sure in 3.5 years the transaction rate will have far surpassed 4000 per 10 minutes, and fees will be well beyond that.
Edit: further elaboration.

Going to have to go a little overboard on the pedantic scale... Inflation is a decrease in the general price of goods. It has nothing to do (directly) with a fixed or expanding supply.
However!: the current supply is expanding. For the next few years (until block 420000) the supply will be increasing by ~3600 btc per day.
The decrease in prices (i.e. the deflation) is simply a result of demand outstripping the 3600btc natural supply.
@_date: 2013-03-30 07:23:28
I mean a decrease in the numerical bitcoin price of goods.
E.g. a loaf of bread goes from 0.05btc to 0.005btc as the value of a bicoin goes from $90.00 to $900.00.

Bitcoin gets about one block every 10 minutes. The maximum block size that is currently valid is 1000000 bytes. The average transaction is ~250 bytes.

The idea is that fees grow as usage picks up, while at the same time the block reward decreases very slowly.
Fees will probably dwarf the block reward before the next halving (~2017), so the hashrate should remain high.
You can look at the hashrate change during the first halving this last December. Every subsequent halving should have even less of an impact, up until 2140 after which the network will be entirely fee supported.

There are two main differences:
One is that it uses a memory-intensive hashing algorithm for mining, so GPU and ASIC mining is less advantageous. This change doesn't seem to be too bad of an idea.
The other is that instead of the average time between blocks being 10 minutes, with litecoin it is 2.5 minutes. This change is regarded as affording only minimal advantages, but (according to some bitcoin devs) will likely lead to instability if litecoin becomes more popular. I can elaborate on this some if you'd like, but for now I'll leave it at that.
