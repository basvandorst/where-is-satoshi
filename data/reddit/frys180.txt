Lol. Feels good making money trading. I used to be a hodler until I took a Nissan Altima to the knee.
This is funny as fuck though
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:35:21
Let me get this straight. A post by a guy who knows a guy that works at coinbase is proof? 
Also, Insider trading? LOL How the fuck can it be insider trading when you know that releasing a coin is dramatically going to pump the price?! It's just reality. Them releasing BCH by *default* will pump the price. Whether they knew or not. If I owned coinbase and I knew I were releasing BCH I would've sold all my Bitcoins into BCash and short Bitcoin and made **INSANE** profits. I just would.
Who the hell wouldn't?!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:21:34
I got in the *moment* GDAX released BCH. Literally clicked "update gdax" BCH popped up and I was like... Hoooooly shhhhiiiiiiiiii......!!!!!!!!!!
RAN to Bittrex!

Well it would. But I invested that into verge and well, lets just say I'm a happy man :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:49
Oh. Sorry to hear that..
WELL, if you want to get some money back, I suggest you invest in Verge (XVG). I bought in on the killer dip at 390 sats. (bout 30 min ago) You can still get in for a good price. TOTAL bullish action on Support practically the whole way!!! This is easily going to be the next Cardano. Easy 10x before Christmas.
10 billion dollar extra market cap is nothing now. The gold rush is here ��️

Lol chill man. I'm not gonna sit here and deny that coinbase didn't know what they were doing. [They knew exactly what they were doing.]( I just don't see the meaning of such intense feelings. If any of us could inside-trade or influence the market with [just a tweet]( we would. Especially if we could make millions of dollars doing it.

No problem. At the end of the day it's easier to simply earn fiat and put it into crypto and hodl. Much safer too.

@_date: 2017-12-20 22:37:48
I didn't haha. I sold long ago. Had to weigh in the opportunity costs as well. I could've held but if I didn't put that sell into Verge (XVG) last night I would've been down -30% as opposed to +70% :)

Yeah it's kinda sad. Btw, you can use [this website]( to speed up transactions. I use it every time. I hope BTC solves this problem soon Especially with other competitors taking the space with faster transactions. [Dash]( is right behind them as well. Even faster than Ethereum with instant send.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:51:35
Ironically, I think bitconnect plays a nominal role in boosting the value of bitcoin. In any case, what a lot of people fail to realize is that essentially all stocks/assets, even bitcoin, is based on the ponzi model. When you invest into bitcoin and its value goes up and you sell, where did that value come from? And if everyone wanted to sell at the same price at the same time would that be possible? No. 
There will be few winners, but many losers. And the more you stand to gain relative to everyone else, the more you profited from other people's money. It's just not noticeable in bitcoin because we're in a bull market. Bitconnect simply allocates more risk relative to its growth and pays people dividends (via lending) in the process. The lending proposition greatly increases demand for the coin which in part increases its value. When we talk about sustainability we have to think in scale. It's not a model that'll last until we're old and gray, but it's sustainable for a good while.

You'd still be able to get bitcoin to fiat. You'd have to go through currency exchanges but it could still be done. Or, you could do it locally. Similar to the china ordeal, it'll bounce back at it's lowest point.

@_date: 2017-11-03 17:58:00


That's the thing. All those billions of regular folk won't be attracted to bitcoin like us geeks. The learning curve for crypto is *very* steep. Something has to be done to make it more user-friendly. Right now, a crypto like [Dash]( has a strong possibility of being the Facebook to Bitcoin. They even have an upcoming (optional) [evolution]( platform that'll work like a paypal 2.0
I'll be honest with you. Dash is dynamically better than Bitcoin in almost every way and is quickly expanding into multiple avenues in the private sector. The only reason why it's sitting at \ is because it didn't come first. Imagine, after only watching the links provided, if Dash were first and bitcoin came afterwards. Bitcoin would be somewhere in the middle of the thousands of altcoins.

An increase in demand would definitely increase price. But currently there's a relative limited supply. If large investors started buying lots of SSDs others would then start competing to get a piece of the extra demand and the supply will rise, leading to lower manufacturing costs and eventually a lower price for the consumer.
In any case S2X is cancelled! XD Dammit I was gonna buy alts yesterday at a premium too lol. Still bought a lot before the cancellation though :P

I'd rather not margin 2x.. Futures are already trading within the 4 digit range whereas BCH was trading in three digits. Not only that, it's also going to be added to coinbase. Meaning it'll create significant value to people willing to invest. Btw, as long as there is contention for where bitcoin should go, the price will never drop to zero. Even BCH is slowly creeping up after a long bear market.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:19:13

They pay them by the increased value of their token from the coins previously lent to them, their "volatility bot," and fees by using their exchange. They hold almost all the coins in their possession which allows them to control supply. Enabling them to have greater control of the value of their coin.

Here's the thing. While it may be true that successful marriages are usually maintained via trust, anything can happen at anytime. Marriage, like anything that isn't guaranteed, still has an element of risk. After all, 50% of them end in divorce. How many countless stories do we hear of people suddenly turning a new leaf when "X" happens? What if you're hanging out with another woman and she *thinks* you're cheating on her? There's no such thing as absolute trust.
That's not what really bothers me though. What blows my mind is how any sane person can reason that something they earned from their own hard work automatically belongs to someone else. If my wife (I have a gf but I digress) had a million dollar bitcoin stash and decided to break up with me for any reason, why should I be entitled to her bitcoins? I didn't earn them. She did. This 50/50 split idea is no longer applicable in the modern era. They used to do this because women were relegated to only being house wives and had little job opportunity. That's no longer the case. 
I think marriage is outdated anyway. What else are we doing but signing a contract? gf/bf in a committed relationship is literally the *exact* same thing. Without the extra financial risk.

The aspect of owning part of a company isn't a ponzi in and of itself. What makes it a ponzi is the supply and demand aspect of it. Equifax is a great example of this. After the data breach, their stock lost about 33% of it value from September 7th to Sep 15th. The company itself didn't lose 33% of its value in assets, it lost it in perceived value to people that owned their stock. The few people that got word of the news early benefited. The latter majority that got word of the news late or didn't react early lost out.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:52:43

What I'm going to tell you is probably going to save your life.
[Do not keep your coins on exchanges.](
I repeat. [Do not keep your coins on exchanges.](
Unless you're daytrading/swing-trading or need to have a set amount to invest and move around, you should never treat exchanges as a wallet. You don't have access to your private keys and anything that happens to an exchange also happens to you. All it takes is one good hacker and your whole life is gone. Use a secure  hot wallet like Mycelium or Coinomi (Despite open/closed source criticism, coinomi is still the best multi coin app) and for cold storage either get a Hardware wallet like Trezor or a [Makeshift one like this.](
**Take cold storage seriously.** This is where you'll keep the majority of your coins. Just like your bank. My hot wallet is similar to how much I keep on my person if it were my regular wallet. Personally I like and use the makeshift cold storage method. It's easier to utilize and because I only use it on my secure Wifi connection, I don't have to worry about MITM attacks. It's basically an ASIC at this point. It has one purpose. Withdraw/deposit crypto. **Not browse facebook or reddit etc.**
Hopefully I saved a life today.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:50:20
Best way is to look at the sell volume vs buy volume. If you see a ton of BTC in one area and a huge dip following, it's safe to sell. It takes patience and discipline to not go all out but it can be done.
Also the RSI, EMAs and MACDs help as well.
Edit: Also, don't be greedy. 1% profit a day is a lot. Lots of banks only pay 1 to 2% a year. Consider that.

I 100% feel your sentiment. I wanted to trade on the BTC dip too but my bitcoins took forever to get to bittrex and I lost out on thousands of free dollars I could've made. A whole 12 hours later and I still was sitting with my thumb up my ass.
People here just don't fucking get it. All they want to do is post memes putting down the other side but not bring anything worthwhile to progress BTC's future. It's reaching a fever pitch now. Mempools are only getting more tighter and more expensive. There's a LOT of competitors out there with *dynamically* better networks. Why no one here is worried about this blows my mind. BTC is going to get fucking crushed if it doesn't get its act together.

Firstly, the cheapest fee on Mycelium is 0.53.
In any case, the transaction time (due to more people being in the network at ine time) is one of the major reasons why BTC is ever so more being seen as a "gold" replacement. You can't efficiently trade gold with people as a means of commerce. So we use paper. An even more efficient way of commerce is ACH transfer. Etc.

The general public, despite the news freshly getting involved, still has little idea about what crypto is. To give you a gist of how minuscule crypto is, Gold, *by itself,* has an over 2 trillion dollar market cap. We haven't even reached 1 trillion yet. The entire market cap of US stocks *alone* is 18.5 trillion. We're less than 1% of that. Not only that, crypto is a **global** market. We're crumbs compared to the total sum of what's to come. You think we're popular? Done?! You haven't seen anything yet.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:39:20
Bitcoin's value is base-dependent on how many people hold on to the currency. It still has its stock-like value but it's mostly attributed to the former. The more popular bitcoin becomes, the more value it will obtain. Eventually it'll reach a point in which so many people have it that little bumps like an extra 5 to 6 hundred dollar jumps will be minute blips on the total relative value.
Unlike Enron or the housing bubble, its value has a premise to exist.

It only takes a few lines of code to do it. I have ALL my bitcoins in my personal wallet with MY private keys for this upcoming fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:11:59


He deserved to have 0 bitcoins? Why?
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:10:59
Yeah. Even if they had 75% limit sales that's still 2.16 mil for the day alone.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:26:22
...The fact that it's 30% off..?
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:55:00
The more value it gets, the more stable it will become.
For example. if 1 coin were valued at 100k, it going up or down $400 will have little to no real effect. As opposed to $400 now being 10%.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:55:16
My gf and I told each other to sell and buy more on the downdraft after stabilization :D
Dude this is free bitcoin at this point. 9:00 o-clock trading hours... here we go!!!

Ahh I see. Well hey, you're definitely safer can't argue with that lol. I just can't see myself losing $200+ dollars in debit card deposit fees for a tiny 5k deposit ��

....Will buy back later :)
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:02:59
Oh. Goddamn that sucks..
Edit: Wait... Wouldn't that mean you get charged by both your bank and coinbase? Or is it "about even" by depositing only via debit card?

Hmm. Good point.
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:59:16
Or wake up 40% richer :D
But yeah that's why I feel fiat has some reasonable ground. It's relatively stable and inflation/deflation happens less radically.

Now I know why they say you'll end up coked out of you mind and never sleeping. If I went to sleep I'd have lost thousands. Fucking a.
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:17:27
90% of traders fail. I don't think I'll be the 10% lol. I only bet what I'm willing to lose. I had a portion that I invested back from December 2016 and partially sold that. 3200 is a hard call but if it goes that low again I'll be able to buy back more on a limit buy. At the end of the day I too want as much bitcoin as I can get. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:09:21


If I were to keep both coins on one wallet but instead sent one coin type back and forth to myself between my original wallet and another, would that create different ledger histories effectively immunizing me from replay attacks?

@_date: 2017-10-25 19:04:36
Personally I think *both* should be implemented right now. A 2MB block size isn't going to hurt too much for the moment and implementing both that and segwit would dynamically improve the network. Which we desperately need. However, I only feel this way because bitcoin is in an exponential growth stage and we really need to lower these fees. Our backs are against the wall and although block size increase is by default a more centralized direction, an extra MB increase this *one time* isn't *that* big of a deal and we need to do something to accompany this extreme boost in demand. 


In a static sense, 51% control would be considered centralized. Although dynamically, it can be argued that 20% is a lot as well. Anything less than 51% is subjective and simply depends on what each entity does with their hashshare. However, regarding bitcoin, the best course of action to take would be towards anything that leads to either the same or less centralization. As opposed to tip-toeing around concepts that slowly push bitcoin towards a more centralized point.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:38:45


I don't understand? Why would they do this instead of separating each coin by their specific static forked nomenclature? I don't understand... What the fuck is the complication?!
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:00:33
At first I thought you accidentally replied to me for someone else. Lol nowhere did I say btc will replace gold. If anything Ethereum has a higher chance of doing that due to it being faster and more programmable. I mentioned gold and the U.S. stock marketcap to put into perspective just how small we are on the board.

If people had access to their private keys they'd be able to withdraw as much as they wanted. All they'd have to do is initiate their seeds on another platform.

Not necessarily my ISP. But say I were, for example, connected to public wifi. If someone were to use packet sniffers or other MITM attacks, my transaction data, if unencrypted, could be seen by said attacker. What I'm unsure of is if a VPN can provide protection from my native device's requests.

Hodling is nice, but it was too easy to make a significant profit on my position. (Sold at 4.4k and came in and held around $865) It looks like a Dead Cat though so I only bought back in at 50%. Just in case.
There hasn't been any real positive news or justification for that sudden price jump besides a few whales buying up a *ton* of coin for cheap. People are panic buying/selling now. It's crazy.

Well, if they make at least a million in profit a day from fees, in 2 years they can recover their losses. So far it's not having a realized negative effect. More people are depositing than withdrawing. FUD is actually not the best thing to do now. Wait about a year or two then see how things go. This is one of those devil's advocate times in which secrecy would actually be more favorable than exposure.
Unlike MtGox, this seems to be more contained. We're talking about millions of dollars and people's lives here. No need to topple the tower when there's more to lose.

FYI, never buy, sell, or transfer coins (Except from coinbase to GDAX) directly from coinbase. Do this on their GDAX platform instead. You'll save a lot of money and avoid a lot of fees.
Also, instead of buying and selling at market, place limit orders instead. It's free. Just got to know what you're doing.

I presume this would only be possible if I did nothing with the other chain? For example, after the fork, if I had 1 btc and btu on each ledger, and only spent coin on *one* chainline, that entire chain of events could be replayed on the other chain. That makes sense. 
However, if I send my BTC **and** BTU through two different wallet chains, (then back to my original multi-wallet) would that immunize me?
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:50:30
Well, I say it's both good and bad. I like selling high and rebuying low after FUD waves. Free money and coins Imo.

Most people have problems with them because they have **zero** communication with their customers. Frankly I'm scared every time I use coinbase. Sometimes I get paid in crypto and I shouldn't have to worry about my account being frozen every time I convert a portion to fiat and cash out.

Pros and cons. Either we give our money to Fannie Mae and Chase bank and watch our global economy collapse, or we create a decentralized system and lose millions of dollars worth of bitcoin to mistakes, thieves, and hackers. Nothing is perfect. Personally, I prefer somewhat of a duality of the two. You still need order and rules for society to function, but I like my privacy and a more feasible option regarding control over my money.

@_date: 2017-10-20 06:53:44
The Zimbabwe exchanges value bitcoin more because of how more its value is relative to their dollar. 
It's like when a single exchange stops fiat withdrawals, the price of crypto on that exchange skyrockets because everyone is trying to convert to crypto and get out as fast as possible. The same is happening but instead everyone is pushing money into exchanges to convert to crypto as fast as possible.
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:53:56
Even GDAX from Coinbase makes this a no-brainer. I'll never understand...
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:13:37
Everything you say is correct. Especially considering market psychology and average user action. However, if we were to keep solving the scaling problem by making the block sizes bigger, it would eventually reach a point in which only a select few would be able to manage the bitcoin ledger. In other words, it would become more centralized. Increasing the block size solves the problem for now in the short-term, but what happens when even more people use bitcoin? Will we just keep increasing block size? Would 100mb blocks or even 50 seem practical? There's a point of diminishing returns.
Increasing block size is akin to disk drives increasing RPM for read/write speeds. Sure you can "2x" your speed by doubling your rpm, but there comes a point where it becomes impractical for most. A different solution would be to create a solid state drive while using the same SATA interface. Both solutions increase read/write speeds, but one is more practical than the other in the long-term.

Well you can do limit trading for free on GDAX. And market trading is extremely cheap. Usually around 0.25% with your average bitcoin trade. You'll need a Coinbase account first. Btw, don't use Coinbase to buy/sell bitcoin unless you have absolutely no money and you want to buy bitcoin in an emergency. There's no need as the fees in the GDAX exchange are drastically lower.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:58:22


You'll keep asking yourself this. Same people asked this when it mooned to 1k. 2k. 4k. Etc. The answer is get in while you still have a good gradient of opportunity. Example: I missed out on Ethereum when it was $10 a piece. I saw it shoot from $10 to $30 and bought in when I saw it hit $30. Could have made 3x from establishing a position earlier but at least I made 10x from my initial buy.
Diversify. You usually want to invest 50% in safe investments, 25% in risky investments, and 25% in high-risk investments.
I'm currently invested in about 20+ different cryptos. With bitcoin of course being my main asset. This is the dot.com boom era of cryptocurrency. Get these coins while they're super cheap and enjoy your gains when it gains mainstream traction in the future.
Btw, here's a word of advice. The more fast and user friendly a crypto is, the more you're going to want to invest in it towards the future. Bitcoin is *not* user friendly but has the benefit of being first. Frankly, there are other coins out there that function better than bitcoin. (Ethereum and Dash for example) Bitcoin is destined to become the MySpace of crypto if it doesn't improve. In the end, you have to do your own research. Keep your eyes open and think about things from a broader perspective as opposed to the right now.
