This is huge.  Making payments easy for 'average Joe' consumers is the key to widespread adoption. I find the automatic payments to authorized merchants and pay without internet via Bluetooth to be the most exciting proposed features

My Razr HD has been a good phone, but KitKat has slowed it down a bit which is sad. Wish I'd gone with the Maxx for that little bit of extra juice &gt;_&lt;

Love contests like this!  Thanks in advance ;)

Hilarious but sad.  I guess people are just conditioned to think that nothing is free, or maybe they were all just too drunk to care about anything.

Though I think this would be funny, it may come across as insensitive to a lot of people and deter them from further checking out Bitcoin.  People are entitled to their opinion regardless of whether it's valid or completely uninformed. Professor bitcorn is going to be humiliated enough by his prediction being completely inaccurate.  Also, I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I have a feeling using someone's picture without their permission in the US, especially for something meant to be humiliating, is probably illegal.  That's just my 2 bits.

The crowdsale is going on for a month. If you're really that concerned, wait two weeks to contribute.
@_date: 2014-06-03 01:21:48
Haha I also assumed a Boston/Maine accent.  I looked behind the paywall, and apparently it's supposed to be 'cash.'

Remember that the entire file wenit be stored on a single node since it's chunked. Yes it's possible all three nodes could go offline, but it's highly unlikely. If your data is important enough that this is a concern, you can set the redundancy level higher.

Storj is currently at the NABC, so there hasn't been a lot of time to answer long technical questions while on a mobile device. Give us some time, and we'll address your questions more thoroughly.

True, his arrogance may prevent him from ever feeling humiliated, and he may continue to think that the price will decrease even as Bitcoin becomes more and more ubiquitous. I should have said that his *reputation* will be damaged enough.

Metadisk, development on DriveMiner, etc. You can't expect a fully functional, bug free program overnight.

I changed my downvote to an upvote after feeling guilty.  The less people who know, the greater the chances of winning muahaha.  Seriously though, that's a pretty sweet looking car, and I admire your efforts to educate the public on Bitcoin. Any chance of adding a Florida city into the rotation? Tallahassee is pretty close to ATL...

Just got the update to KitKat on my Droid Razr HD with Verizon a couple weeks ago.  Before that Wallet wasn't allowed because it was competition to ISIS, but now the functionality is stock in Android.

Yes, I believe you're correct. Though if you contribute during a later phase of the crowdsale you'll receive 10% more Storjcoins --&gt; 5% more Storjcoins --&gt; Storjcoins at the standard rate.  Glad you're excited too :)

The redundancy will be automatically managed by the network, so if a node goes down, the network will automatically transfer from the remaining nodes to keep the redundancy constant.

The first application by Storj, Metadisk, is already in beta.  All of the code is open source and on GitHub.  You can find more information and join the beta by visiting the forums at

We're at the NABC (sitting at a table foregoing presentations  to address some of these concerns, in fact)  and are traveling Monday. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:33:28
Yes scams are scams. Startups, on the other hand, are chaotic and seek to create something from nothing which takes time and resources. I'd say from how new Storj is, what's been accomplished so far is pretty impressive. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:06:01
Thank you! I look forward to testing your site out.

Let's build the first Bitcoin citadel there.

Which rom do you use, Cyanogenmod?

This is gone over in the crowdsale deck and in the forums. On my mobile, so I can link you to the specific thread, but you should be able to find it on the crowdsale board pretty easily.
