Is it pointless for me to buy in now? I have 1k that I could spend on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:03:36
Hmm okay.  Should I just buy it from coinbase? I use to mine years ago, now I just cringe looking at the price.  I had $50 worth of BTC on coinbase too. But it was locked on my old uni email and I can't access it lmao.

This subreddit will forget about it by next week.

In what world is a 970 old ? Lmao. I'm using a  card way shitter than that.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:34:55
That's so risky. You could be better off investing your money elsewhere. Jesus. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:33:16
Try sending a lower amount to gdax then your other wallet ?

I had the same issue, I think we're screwed. Not sure if anyone else remembers but back in 2015/2016 coinbase was extremely hated on this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:03
Damn, coinbase.  This was around the time when this sub absolutely hated them   
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:57:40
Lol they have bigger issues than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:23
Chill. Sorry dude. I'm just toxic. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:20
Damn.  I wish I had a 970.  I'd trade you some dogecoin for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:34:12
And the entire cafe cheered "bitcon bitcoin Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:55:08
Damn. I wish you were my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:22:05
Its funny how these comments think they know better than him lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:49:54
Creating an account on coinbase and buying Bitcoin doesn't make you an investing expert. Jesus, these guys are joking investing million's, Bitcoin is a game to them and you think they're "noobs" at investing lmao
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:22:29
I just did it. Bitcoin took like 2 hours though.

I don't want some used dog that could possibly have a PTSD attack once I turn on a vacuum. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:33:28
Such a random number. Pretty sus.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:04:44
That is a horrible idea dude. Jesus, I hope you have a massive saving account. This isn't a personal finance subreddit.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:07:17
They would easily steal people's money, transaction's would always be an error. I could dig up a bunch of old posts. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:02:00
No. Why ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:43:20
What's a good serious bitcon sub?
