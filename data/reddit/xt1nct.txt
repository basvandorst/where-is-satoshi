WoW I've never seen so much GOLD!!! To the moon we go!
Edit: Thank you for gold kind stranger!
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:28:50
Wooooo this is a great roller coaster ride! I'm glad I bought some at $800.
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:17:22
I hope we will get some news soon, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Looks like some people are buying right now.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:34:20
I can report that news also spread to Poland.
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:26:43
I'm so stupid for buying bitcoin after tigerdirect news.....i should have predicted a little drop before the moon.

I'm European my parents often wanted to send money to Europe. However, they need to pay fees and when they travel by plane the amount of money they can carry is limited. 
All immigrants all over the world need to know how easy it is to move any amount of cash around with bitcoins. No banks, no fees, no bullshit.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:07:14
It will be hard to stop at this point. Many people that hold bitcoins have a lot of capital and thus would end in courts.  Why should anyone be able to tell us we can trade something?(besides illegal weapons) I would not sit back if bitcoin got banned, that would be some serious invasion of my freedom. Meanwhile, banks would be laundering money and operating as usual.
@_date: 2014-02-28 01:31:02
I happened to look at comments in some other articles.......damn people that post there are fucking stupid.
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:15:54
Doesn't HSBC operate in New York? Maybe they should focus on that......I'm beyond tired of these asshats trying to scare people.

This isn't the case only in Brazil, sadly insurance companies care about one thing which is profit. In US people with disabilities also fight daily to get benefits approved. It's a shitty system and big corporations can easily wear out someone with less capital.

1. Even media followed last btc roller coaster.
2. Gox situation is considered resolved, coins are gone.
3. People were sitting in fiat and now are buying back since we most likely bottomed out.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:50:46
I use chase and made a few bitcoin transactions. No issues yet.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:20:26
I live in the US but my dad barely speaks any English so he gets his news from Polish websites. Today he asked me about Mt.gox, news about Mt.Gox are spreading everywhere! 
As long as articles explain why Mt.Gox went down I really think this is good news. Yes many lost a lot of money, but if they never invest again they will be replaced by new people.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:32:35
I didn't have any btc in Gox but the way this situation was handled is unbelievable. I can't believe someone dealing with such amounts of money can be this incompetent. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:27:22
I call Mac the $2000 facebook machine for the masses
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:43:14
I'm usually very optimistic but I have a feeling we will see 200's within 5 days.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:25:53
What about all the legal issues surrounding gox right now?
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:57:34
Well I don't expect to be allowed to own weapons of mass destruction. Bitcoin can't be used directly to harm another human being. So yeah.
@_date: 2014-01-04 13:34:18
I have no stand on gun policy, however guns are much more accessible in the US than Europe.
Chicago is in cook county also known as CROOK county. It's full of crooked cops, politicians, and gangs.
Also, I do understand why a large amount of Americans are big on weapons after all we needed them during the revolution. If there is ever another revolution guns will be very useful.
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:22:22
I dislike your restocking fee's, however I might shop there now.
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:51:14
Good point...I thought about this after I wrote that comment....taking current technology into consideration Americans are fucked guns or no guns.
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:14:15
To be honest I haven't reviewed it...it's not a fun to read material. I was hoping to get opinion of someone that has a better understanding of such things.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:55:31
In most class action suits there is no upfront cost. Lawyer takes a % of the settlement.
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:40:53
I don't think there is a good solution to this problem at this point. If they resume everything, people will pull out. Most likely sell off cheap coins on other exchanges.  
If they ask for more time nobody sane will invest in btc and prices will keep falling.
Either way gox is holding btc hostage. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:50:50
Exactly. If my bank pulls this shit I will politely bitch at the manager of the branch. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:06:17
Hey, we benefit from not having discipline and we wrote this propaganda research piece with big words. Hopefully all the sheepole will "realize" how flawed bitcoin is and how superior fiat money is.
JP Morgan needs to focus on paying fines on money laundering and fk off.
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:20:06
A forum with trusted vendor list would work. A place where vendors/customers can settle any issues.
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:19:32
I only use coinbase and cryptsy and DID NOT receive any emails.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:37:18
Well when you sell anything there is really no way to check if the money is stolen.
OP needs a lawyer 
@_date: 2013-12-28 09:25:14
I had this same error after enabling 2FA verification. I've created a ticket asking them to reset my verification and within 2 hours issues was resolved. Hope it helps.
No coins were lost and withdrawal still went through.
Edit: I know use authy for verification which is AWESOME!
@_date: 2013-12-28 09:51:06
Looks like another big drop ahead.
