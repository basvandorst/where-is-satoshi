Just about all the Casinos the are 100% BTC deposit only sites that I play at all credit my deposits to my available balance immediately upon transaction being sent, Mbit - Vegascasino - USbitcoincasino - BitStarz, and a couple others as well, the catch being though that in order to cashout any winnings or even just deposited amount they won't until your most recent deposit shows 3 + conf.

Exactly put up enough BTC to cover 20 tacos once a month at current fees, and with the house discount for pre-purchasing 20 tacos at one time I think we've got a win-win right? lol

I would recommend they begin setting up &amp; offering online pre-ordering capability thus eliminating the possible ridiculous wait time in house, I mean if they really wanna go the distance accepting BTC for tacos, bottom line though...
MAJOR RESPECT for these small time business owners willing to wade through the rough seas of BTC acceptance at this stage in the game that's EXACTLY what we need A LOT MORE small business owners to do if our dreams of insane growth and increased acceptance become a reality! MY HATS OFF TO 'TAQUERIA La OAXAQUENAS' I live about 40 minutes away from these guys but I am going to get tacos to show my appreciation. 100% BTC Tacos Rock!
