Only btc not bch
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:58:27
That was basic math done in my head lol...
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:25:24
I'd hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:47:19
It's still sitting at $7629 at the moment too.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:35:51
Just as soon as everyone realises BTC instead of the Segwit2x crap is still and will always be the universal and original Crypto currency it will skyrocket. That's the only thing stopping people right now is their unsurity of which coin will prevail. Bitcoin is the original and has an over $115 Billion market cap, To even question it with all the billionaire investors on board now and celebrities is ridiculas, but that's just fine it gives us all time to BUY BUY BUY before it skyrockets.

Just sit tight and watch the next 24 hours alone. Will reach $8,000. But that's nothing, wait until Nov 14-15th. That's where the real fun begins!
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:45:26
What's the worst that can happen? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:11:39
Yeah except localbitcoin is still charging $6700+ per BTC. And it's at $5900 right now. Which is why I want a fair price and direct exchange 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:23:08
I stand corrected. As soon as I said that it went from $7000.00 to 1 minute later $7111.62
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:01:09
6799 and ill put my entire savings into it. I'll be buying Bitcoin in about an hour reguardless though even at this price. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:43:11
Download electrum that's where I've always stored all my coins. If you have a computer that is. If youre using your phone, I believe Electrum has an app as well but im not 100% sure.

United States is weekly, usually.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:53:02
I got a screenshot of coinbase when it showed $7400.00 on my phone
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:53:54
That can only mean bitcoins price will be going up very soon as it's gaining a lot of popularity already.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:16:19
Localbitcoin doesn't require ID verification.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:00:50
I have Bitcoin Checker App on my phone and Its a 24/7 clickable notification to refresh instantly. So when it was around that price I was spam clicking it anxious for the updates and got a screenshot at $7400
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:05:39
Probably some type of fees associated with transfer of coins or if you used Bitpay for the transaction that probably charged you a fee as well.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:46:48
And technically speaking if you took out tons of debt,. The banks can't find you and take your Bitcoin especially if you have it stored in the correct wallet. So sell everything you have and leverage as much debt as you can and buy Bitcoin, put it in a backpack and be homeless for 3-4 years. And you'll thank yourself later
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:07:24
Isn't GDAX Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:09:26
I got a wallet address you can send the coins to keep them safe;)
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:32:31
So I can place orders and wait to see if btc price increases while the coins at the predetermined price are in escrow, and if it doesn't then cancel my order - repeatedly, as many times as I would like, without being red flagged or having any negative consequences? Of course if I cancel my order they get their coins back from escrow, but it's the inconveniences for some of the sellers that I see might lead to negativity.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:38:59
Price is up $50 in last 5 minutes alone
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:13:26
Not too many are even aware of what btc is at this point. But they're starting to find out with media attention. It's only a matter of time until someone goes on Fiverr and pays someone $5 for some Social Media advertising in front of millions of people announcing all the gains Bitcoin has been making people, and adding tons more people to the market. And btc will skyrocket. Plus as soon as the fork is over and Bitcoin is determined to be the central standard cryptocurrency that alone will skyrocket the price adding all the skeptics that weren't sure what will happen. At the fork that aren't even buying right now.

What's maximum amount you can buy at once with btc ATM ? And what type of fees will that cost to use?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:23:54
Looks like he's not a millionaire anymore with the price dip
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:35:49
This is actually very surprising to me. How recently did you start hearing about Bitcoin in person as a Dailey coincidence?
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:05:10
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:36:46
You must of missed when it hit $7444 an hour ago

So at a current price of only $7299 for a $682,500 value..... Now that's a real deal for 5 bucks pal!
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:51:59
Not sure about other currency. I only use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:37:30
Tomorrow is Friday.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:02:50
Oh I didn't sell anything. I'm just waiting to buy more to add to my collection.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:54:38
Not as in buying a whole btc for $4500. As in buying $4500 more worth of btc.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:55:08
Isn't GDAX and Coinbase same thing? I went to GDAX and went to register an account and it brought me to Coinbase registration.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:47:58
Price already is shooting back up. This ain't no dip bud. Just a 10 minute mess up. But I was really hoping it was a dip, I have $4500 saved up for the next dip to buy at
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:36:31
MoneyGram is my usual payment method for all my coins I currently have. And when you place an order you place the USD amount and it autofills in the Btc amount and then you click BUY. And it puts that amount of coins in escrow and asks you to proceed with payment and gives you a 280 minute window to pay before it automatically cancels the trade, so anytime in that window of time your set to have the exchange for the predetermined price.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:48:07
Yet if you divided every US dollar in existence to everyone In the world equally, EACH person would get approx $1500.
So 455 People together to total 1btc.
455 people with equal shares of the USD would have a total of $682,500.
$682,000 will be what a BTC should be worth...
Buy buy buy

Localbitcoins.com my friend. I've bought over $50,000 worth of Bitcoin in the past month there. I prefer to use vendors with 100+ trades and 100% positive feedback. Never once have I had any issues. I prefer using MoneyGram as my payment method, but they have just about every possible payment method imaginable. Prices at which people sell their coins at will very depending on your payment method though.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:31:55
The price of btc is dropping because of panic sellers - I just said Go ahead, I'll buy my coins when you panic sellers drop the price for me!
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:36:11
It's brand new. Has never been used.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:27:40
Yes, Read my post I just posted to explain exactly why.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:24:58
Invest everything you own In Bitcoin. Leave your computer at home and join the army and be gone for 5 years. Come home to wealth
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:53:36
Why would you tell the newbies to stop? That's how you get Bitcoin at good prices lol.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:25:39
I started with $25 a few years ago. And it's worth $1037 now.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:05:40
Price is about to skyrocket tonight. And I just bought 2.7BTC for this exact reason.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:45:32
Yeah just as I posted this I checked it again and it went from $6700 to over 7k in those 2 minutes.
Hopefully people still panic sell because I really didn't even buy yet on this crash and that's disappointing really....
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:16:10
Good. Easier to hodl when you have no way to check how the price is doing

I've vaguely heard about BTC ATMs but I'm not sure how they work or if there are any nearby me. And what are the fees like with those? And can you buy at least like $500 worth at a time with them?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:45:47
What's Coinbase fees?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:09:09
Pre-ordered as gift for someone who also already pre ordered one aswell
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:24:10
Yeah. Like banks will be used for getting loans so people can buy Bitcoin with it.
