Suicided. I doubt this has anything to do with crypto currencies.

Combatting a single pool hitting 51% gives a false sense of security considering how small the pool culture is. 2-3 large pools could easily collaborate on a 51% attack.
While there certainly should be efforts to prevent a 51% attacker; a 51% attack WILL eventually happen. There needs to be significant consideration on how to recover from a successful one.

That's not entirely true. Only in the aspect of sniffing traffic does it matter. But there are several scenarios where putting it a GET param is bad: 
* it can end up in browser history
* if for any reason HTTPS is broken down on the network for inspection it will be in the logs (not uncommon on corporate and school networks who inspect traffic at the perimeter)
* it will end up in clear-stored messages on forums like you see in the screenshot
* urls always get passed in clear msg systems from twitter to email
* shoulder surfing

DDG and coinbase have the same VC, Union Square Ventures. USV heavily encourages the companies under their umbrella to collaborate, but I guess these two don't so much.

Thanks for clarifying. The post being as short as it was left a lot of room for interpretation. I get your point now, and valid it is.

Of course there is:
* SSL is rarely end-to-end; meaning that it often terminates at the load-balancer; so way more people behind that loadbalancer have access to passwords than should have.
* Corporate and school networks often break down SSL at the proxy and install local certs on client machines. This means there's a good chance that piece of shit nosy sys admin has your password
* If Mt.Gox supports weak SSL cyphers, there's a chance users are negotiating over paper-thin crypto
* etc...
And even if they did hash the password, since that's done on the client, it's replayable and the hash is effectively the password rather than the clear-text value.
But regardless, yes, this shouldn't even be a get parameter. It should be a post and they should have proper session management.

As someone who has been breaking websites for a living for the past 15 years; never trust anyone who says something that 100% secure.

Thanks for the clarification. My brain didn't do work properly there for a sec.

In the context of SSL offloading to the load blancer, your browser negotiates with the host at the IP you resolved the domain to. The further communication to the web stack behind the load balancer is invisible to your browser. Most load-bananced environments are built like this, sadly. This means more people have access to the clear data of your communication than should have.
Ideally the only people who should be able to see the data are the database admins and whatever interfaces are used by the employees that need the data. But because of this layout, this also means the server admins, network admins, etc could also potentially see the data. And in situations where a hosting provider is used, this also means that the admins for the hosting service also potentially have access. So what many people think should be only a few people have acess, could actuallly potentially mean 100's.
Regarding SSL termination at the proxy. No, this is similar to above. You client browser thinks it is communicating with the proxy as the end point. Usually SSL is built back up on the other side of the proxy and then terminated at the remote load balancer as above.
The reason companies and schools do this is so that they can inspect the traffic. Sometimes this is for security reasons (e.g. intrusion detect/intrusion prevention), other times it's for policy enforcement.
So when you see sensitive data in a long URL (refered to as a GET request), always question it. A correct implementation of SSL should protect parameters in the URL; but if it breaks down at any point for the above reason, that data is visible. While this is also true for POST requests, the contents of a POST request generally don't appear in all of the logs, meaning that in order to snoop the data, the viewer has to be running a network sniffer; but with GET requests, they just need access to logs (which generally is way more accessible).

It's been my experience that conferences are put together to make money; not to further a cause (Jeff Moss of BH/DC was a multi-millionaire in a few short years).
But even if that's the case; it's in their best interest to make the vids free for the first couple of years in order to grow the culture.

I'm not sure why you are getting down-voted. Given that [this incomplete list of pending BFL orders]( represents a new 133TH/s in the total mining pool; you have to expect a significant dip in the price per coin due to a minimum of 10000 new BTC's mined per day.
Certainly the market will recover; but there will be a flood of new coins for a while as the BFL equipment needs to be paid for. And I'm sure most of the BFL customers will also be cashing in pretty heavily in the beginning to fund more BFL orders.
Again, assuming BFL isn't a complete scam (throwing a proto type at a payment provider, and a couple of videos in a controlled environment aren't enough to prove they are shipping).

Why does charity need to have bullshit borders and boundries? Are homeless in another country of any less value as humans than local homeless?
Bitcoin is making the point that boundries are a bullshit control mechinism.

I think you are missing his point. He's implying that PB is stable due to passion and Mt.Gox may be missing that passion.
I could, however, be wrong...

Since Qantum Computing wouldn't flood the market, Bitcoin would likely be able to react.
The real issue with quantum computing is that any flaws/collisions that exist in SHA256 would likely be found fairly quickly.

Nope but they are certainly giving US exchanges the boost by crippling the market leader. Don't think for a second that this is an innocent compliance thing. Governments don't move this fast when innocent.

Just to clarify, I will use "beginner" in the context of someone wanting to get into mining on a budget.
Also, disclaimer: I'm new to the mining game, so some of the below are assumptions; so I could be way off her.
I think all ASIC will do is further exacerbate the difficulty of beginners being able to join the game. Ask any serious miner and they are convinced the 5GH/s BFL's (the entry-level ASIC's) will be pointless in the new flood of ASIC's on the market in the months to come.
Certainly difficulty will continue to go up quickly. While this may very well increase the value of coins; it also reduces the mining rate. Give &lt; TH/s miners a very low coin gen rate ( &lt; 1 coin/week ) .
In a year when you expect ASIC's to become cheap (and readily available), serious miners will be well into the TH/s spectrum. This will further spread the gap between beginners and pros; and further reducing the slice of the pie available to beginners.
But in the end; the OP has a decent avantage in his kw/h costs. But that really comes into play when he is being efficient. My advice would be if you get into the mining game; be energy-efficient in your hardware selection. Chose your hardware based on hashes/kw/h as the primary factor and bump hashes/time down to secondary metric.

I assume burning in at BFL means used to mine coins for BFL for 6 months prior to shipping.

Ideally there would be no outage. It's not like it needs to be one webserver with one IP address and one database server.
Mt.Gox is a cashcow for it's owners. There's no excuse for a lack of availability and hardware.

College for me was an experiment to prove that college isn't for everyone. I dropped out after 3 semesters of bullshit filler classes and it was the best thing I ever did.
The only hinderance to no degree in my life is getting past HR with open job posting. This is why I network for jobs rather than apply to open postings.
I don't know why anyone would want to every go through an HR posting anyway. It's better to be the guy that a hiring manger wants than to line up with 100's of faceless applicants and hope that your particular form of bullshit is better than the others. 
Of course this model only works if you actually develop your career as you work rather than occupy a pointless job and watch the clock every day.

You could have stopped before the last paragraph and had a nice/insightful post. No need for the passive agression; the concept is a good one.
