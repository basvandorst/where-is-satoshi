Sorry, but this statement has zero information value to me. How exactly is the ordinary user able to prepare for what‘s coming? It‘s like polishing and sharpening weapons but a storm flood is coming.

In case nobody has mentioned it: There is bisq.io, an anonymous exchange, working over Tor, where you can buy and sell Bitcoin in small quantities with a regular bank account and other payment options. It‘s using multiple signatures to secure your money/bitcoin and a security deposit. I‘ve used it several times and had no issues yet.
And thanks for your brief description of your attempt to invest into the Bitcoin world.

A Bitcoin ETF would make Bitcoin accessible through stock exchanges all over the world. That, of course, would easen the access to Bitcoin for non tech affine people. It would also allow to trade Bitcoin from the same interface a traditional trader or bankster is already using. No need for a second interface to crypto markets. 
Bitcoin’d also be kept and tracked in the same portfolio with all the other commodities.
So this guy is either neglecting reality, dumb or trying to downplay the potential of crypto currency.

But isn‘t it enough KYC to have the account data of someone who has just sent a SEPA transfer? The bank is obliged to KYC, so you should be able to trust people with bank accounts, no?

Am I looking for something different? I am seeing confirmation times of a few minutes right now: 
Ah.. BCC is BitConnect. But still there are lots of blocks:
