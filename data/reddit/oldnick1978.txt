I bought some Eve Online game time codes, a few oz of silver, and a mining rig (bad investment)

As far as legality, unless it's otherwise specified in local laws, I would argue that bitcoin should be treated as a commodity that's bartered rather than a currency.  Would it be legal to buy (non-numismatic) gold or silver bullion and ship it out of the country?  Then again, my opinion doesn't matter and that's why corporate lawyers are paid a ton of money.

A friend and I pooled our BTC and got 2x AntMiner S1s. At the time they were 1.1 BTC each (about $700, if I recall the exchange rate correctly)

You'd have to find someone willing to trade bitcoins for Ethiopian Birrs. That's basically all an exchange is - a website to make it easier to trade one currency for another. If nobody is willing to trade Dollars for them, though, you may have trouble converting to bitcoins (or anything for that matter)

Once you spend them on something that could be traced back to you (like ordering something from Tigerdirect), wouldn't that negate any anonymity you gain from TOR?

There's probably an app, but you'd likely burn up your tablet before you got 1 satoshi.

What if the receipt printer printed off a paper wallet with your change? Though that might be an issue if the printer was out of paper. Could the clerk print off a duplicate QR code?

The plural of money is "moneys" or "monies."

English is notoriously unfriendly for non-native speakers.
It's been over 15 years since I've had an English class in school, but the way I'd explain it is:
In the sense used here, money means "a system of exchange" so replace "money" in the sentence with "system of exchange" and see if it should be singular or plural.
"Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital &lt;system of exchange&gt;."
It's similar to saying "The Dollar is the United States official money." 
The plural could be used, "There are many monies used around the world."

You might be able to sell it on Craigslist. If you're a gambler, you could put it on one of the exchanges and flip it back and forth between BTC and other currencies trying to increase it.
