They are all hedging their bets making money when it goes up and down. These wallstreet guys are both long and short.

Everything is on the blockchain so govt can do their data analysis and basically map out your transactions. The addresses give you pseudo-anonymity at best.

They knew what they were getting into.

It was being mentioned in reddit for sure. During the very early days, people would tip it out for free. Its been mentioned for a long time in tech news especially since it was being used to buy drugs and stuff in darknet markets.

People are fickle - I'll wager that the vast majority of miners are only in it for the money and not because they really care about crypto.

There are tons of other currencies out there. Bitcoin will only get cracked down if it constitutes a major threat to the dollar. It will never get to that stage. Bitcoin and few other altcoins will eventually find a sweet spot like all other currencies.

Crypto won't go into obscurity whatever happens. Enough people have seen the core technology to build on top of it. Might not be bitcoin that makes it but there will be some coin.

You already should have eaten your dick with ketchup.

What's happening with btc is same as your usual stock trades. Startups fail 90% of the time and take a huge chunk of capital with them.

No, they cannot move anywhere. They will have to start from scratch in a new country. You can't carry your manufacturing infra, components, design docs etc. At best you can take some US engineers with you...
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:32:48
You can do that even with dogecoin.

Rocket tech is weapons tech. You cannot "break" with the govt. Eventually, I think it will get to the point where you have many many launch providers. Like airlines.

Only because no-one can mine themselves.

Its a bubble right now but eventually it will settle and improvements made. We are nowhere near its final form.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:06:30
They are just waiting to see what will happen. They'll never let it overthrow the USD though. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:01:14
Like who? Launch permits aren't the only thing. You need to design and build the rockets. The vendors won't touch you.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:44:55
You cannot pack up and leave like that. Rocket tech is seen as weapons technology. You _have_ to play ball with the govt.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:18:49
You watch the trends and make decisions accordingly. So long as you're careful and not greedy, you'll have more money than when you started.
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:37:02
Why would they be? No company operates like that.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:46:47
That means nothing because there is no lock-in.  Other altcoins can co-exist and if they are better etc, there will be a slow bleed away from bitcoin. We are only starting to figure out this technology so bitcoin will have to keep pace and adapt a hell of a lot. Maybe it will, but I feel if bitcoin is still around in the future, it will be majorly different to how it is now.

@_date: 2018-02-09 11:37:20
Yes, because they had permission. If they did not, they would not have been able to hire engineers, buy components from vendors etc.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:23:32
Tons of software/services during the early internet didn't make it. Blockchain and cryptocurrency will survive but there is no guarantee that bitcoin will. It will never go zero because of sentiment and it being the very first currency though.
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:50:55
Nope. They'll revoke all your flight permits.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:23:33
Were you constantly irritating them talking about bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:27:02
Crowdfunding is only good for one-off projects not for startups. Startups need a lot of money and repeat funding. Much easier convincing 10 people to give 2m each than 10k people 1k. Not to mention that funding rounds raise several hundred million sometimes.

Musk has denied this saying he would never ever do something like that.
