I know user growth numbers at large exchanges I do business with. I run analytics campaigns. You don't.
So yeah, I think I know more than you about what's going on with volume and transactions these days.
Without getting into specifics, user growth in recent days at established large exchanges was less than it was on Christmas and New Years.

No, so long as there is enough volume at a given price, market cap can be anything. $2B of actual cash trading back and forth between BTC at increasingly smaller amounts of BTC can create enormous changes in market cap.
Only exchanges that accept fiat really know how much money is going into crypto.

USDT is just another "foreign currency" as far as crypto is concerned. As long as people will pay for it, then it has value.
The only risk USDT creates is if they are printing it and using it solely or predominantly themselves. So long as it's actually being sold to a wide distribution of users, then it's fine.
I would never hold USDT, but that's just me. I see no reason to hold USDT when I can just hold USD.

Whether it's true or not, tough shit. The bitcoin network allows it and so it's valid. If you don't like it, create your own decentralized network to take part in.
If Bitcoin fails because of this, then it deserves to fail. Coinbase is doing nothing wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:23:31
Nothing to be in denial about. There are simply less new users joining the space these days than last month, it's lowering volatility, and it means less transactions.
The reality is Bitcoin is used far less today than a couple weeks ago. It's very obvious.

How many people are actually leveraged? I don't think most are actually leveraged at all.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:25:57
But not on the scale that really matters. It's simply less interest in Bitcoin, less new accounts at exchanges, less moving money to/from exchanges for trading, etc.
You can even see it in the recent volatility that happens on the 14th. It shows up in search trends, it shows up in the mempool, in transactions, in fees, etc.
The trend was slowly clearing from the highs, the crypto tanked hard, volatility spiked, and the trend reversed during the recent volatility.
It's quite clear that the mempool and fees dropping are mainly the result of less network usage in general.

Just because Apple doesn't know what to do with it doesn't mean it's not useful.
Apple is actually doing something really dumb. They are taking on debt to return money to shareholders rather than using it to acquire companies with real cash flow and diversify.
Apple could have bought so many companies by taking on debt and made so much more money in doing so. If Apple had used $150B in debt to buy someone like BAC or JPM, they'd have made over $150B in profit already and own a business worth $300B. Hell, they could have bought FB (or as much of it as possible a few years ago.) Now FB is worth $500B. They could have bought Netflix for $5B and now Netflix is worth $80B.
What did Apple do instead? They bought Beats.
Instead of taking on debt to acquire businesses that create huge amounts of cash flow, they just sit on insane amounts of money, earning a couple billion in interest. Apple is great at making and selling Apple products, but they are among the worst financial managers in the world IMO.

Making purchases is a daily occurrence for most people on this planet. Not knowing anyone that makes purchases in crypto doesn't mean no one does, but it's a heck of a lot more correlated to actual usage than knowing a professional soccer player to total pro players.

Yet USD volumes aren't really going up nearly as much on fiat exchanges like Coinbase.
Shockingly Coinbase isn't growing like it's 2017 all over again, yet people are buying Tether hand over fist. The reality is that most of the developed world has easy access to fiat exchanges with Coinbase, yet somehow it's only the shady exchanges seeing the huge growth...
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:39:50
While not literally true, there is some truth in it. Fees are dropping and the mempool is clearing because there is significantly less usage/transacting. New user growth today is a fraction of what it was in December.
It's a positive feedback loop. Volatility creates more users, more users create more volatility, more volatility creates more transactions. In terms of commerce, usage hasn't improved at all, but in terms of "investor" transactions, it moves with price volatility.

If they issue Tether for someone to use, I sure would hope they were paid for it in the equivalent USD. I mean, that is the point of it, right? They get USD and issue the buyer USDt 1:1.

1. It was never even verified. They simply said "we have this money". No one actually ever verified it as far as I know. They didn't actually turn over their financial statements or anything.
2. How do you know that 70% was taken in via USD deposits and not just trading profit from risky bets on crypto in 2017? Imagine they bought $100M in crypto in early 2017 and then printed a shit load of Tether to pump BTC and then cashed out at $20K. Now that $100M was worth $2B and suddenly all that USDt is "backed".
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:50:35
To be fair, if those 18000 people can't generate more revenue than the cost, whose fault is that?

$50M is a shit load when you realize the order books for crypto are pathetically thin. A 1000 BTC market sell would drop BTC on Bitfinex $600 instantly. Do it on the top 5 exchanges and see what it does...

Tether is now the most widely traded crypto. Let that sink in. $22B in volume was greater than BTC today. 10x the volume it had in 2017.
Yup, nothing odd going on with Tether, it's just being used supposed 10x as much with more printed than ever even those volumes are still lower than 2017 in crypto in general...
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:07:54
Because what you're claiming take a much bigger leap of faith to arrive at.
You're claiming that because we can't see CB's bank accounts, we don't know if they are trading against their own customers with USD that doesn't exist. However, CB is also backed by massively legit VCs like AH and it's highly unlikely they are essentially committing straight up fraud while operating and incorporated in the US and taking hundreds of millions of dollars from very powerful people.
CB can't issue themselves USD. They can't loan themselves USD. To do so would be fraud. BFX can issue themselves USDt since they control Tether.
We already know now that:
1) Tether loaned BFX $800M of their "reserves" . 
2) Tether says they invest their reserves in non-cash equivalents (meaning potentially high risk investments) . 
3) Tether says they buy crypto . 
4) Tether has lied about their funding needs for operations in order to explain their need to invest in risky assets  .
So while the CB situation is theoretically possible, the Tether situation already has much evidence to support it.

And who has this $50M in *USD* that doesn't just buy crypto with USD directly? What idiot would take USD and buy USDt and then buy BTC when they could have just BTC with their USD in the first place?
All you're really seeing is Bitfinex issuing Tether to themselves and buying BTC with it and then claiming USDt is backed with BTC (since they agree now that it's no longer actually backed with USD).

Actually, I believe you can buy AAPL with GOOG so long as there is someone on the other side of the trade that wants to. You can't do it easily simply because stocks aren't infinitely divisible and there is little demand for it. You can even get physical share certificates and give them to people in exchange for their share certificates.
Many of those things are/were probably subject to tax, but whether the government has any interest in pursuing it is another story. The IRS isn't obligated to collect your tax and fight you for every dollar. The IRS knows there is widespread lying on taxes, but it's not viable to audit 400M people every year. They use technology to look for flags and then to look for which audit is likely to yield the most revenue per dollar. It's not that easy to track people privately trading sports cards and collectibles. Crypto on the other hand is a heck of a lot easier and is ripe for taxation considering the enormous gains that have been made.
I'm not an expert with "Like Kind" rules, but it's possible that Beanie Babies and collectibles fall under "Like Kind" rules. This section of tax code allows you to sell assets and replace them with assets of a like kind, with restrictions and guidelines. For example, you can often do it with real estate. You can probably do it with art too.
Crypto most certainly doesn't fall under this tax code though and is subject to taxes upon sale/exchange.
I don't see any problem with taxing day trades in crypto any more than I do taxing day trades in stocks, commodities, currencies, etc. I don't see any reason that crypto should be given a tax break while gold and oil and natural gas aren't.
Now whether you believe in capital gains tax is another thing all together.

Yup, I personally wouldn't hold that, but it's an example of how you could indefinitely avoid taxes.
The risk of an asset is not what should determine whether or not you owe taxes. There is already a reward in holding crypto -- it goes up a lot in value. You don't need to reward it further with indefinite deferment of taxes.
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:41:14

@_date: 2017-12-26 13:02:07
Taxes on crypto-to-crypto make a lot of sense because someone could create a dollar pegged crypto and then you'd never have to pay taxes.
You should pay when you realize a gain for a sale, just like pretty much everything else. If you didn't have to pay, you'd almost never have to pay.
If you don't want to realize gains, don't sell. That's the incentive for holding assets long term. It's the same with stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:30:34
The tax payer profited on bank bailouts  and most banks didn't actually need the money. Most paid it back quickly and with interest.
Banks were overwhelming not insolvent. The financial crisis was largely one of faith and liquidity.
Tax payers also bailed themselves out. Every tax payer benefited from the bailouts. The US economy is a giant interconnected network of workers and businesses. On average they all rise and sink together. Bailing out GM bailed out employees of companies all over the US. It's not like only auto employees and companies benefited.

But as wealthier people/companies have more vested interest in it, they will spend the rather insignificant amount of money to run nodes since it will be in their best interest.
If widespread adoption occurs, then that means it's being used by businesses and wealthy people. These companies and people will run nodes because it is in their own best interest to do so.
If BTC sees global adoption, every publicly traded company in the world will run nodes. Vast numbers of the wealthy people will run nodes.
At the end of the day, just how many full nodes do you really need? Is 10K enough? 100K? You don't need 7B people to run nodes...

I'm sure you can just call customer support and clear it up. It's most likely automatically flagged for reasons that aren't obvious to you but are obvious to them.

@_date: 2017-12-25 21:10:47
Well, now that I think about it, I'm not even sure $150M would be "whale" worthy. The effects of that stack on an exchange with a single order would still be short-lived. Coinbase is doing billions in transaction value and adding millions of customers. $150M will move the market, but it will get swallowed up pretty quickly, be it upwards or downwards IMO.

Even I don't use Segwit. Also, Shapeshift uses it and even with that incentive the costs are too high to matter.
There is no guarantee that Segwit actually lowers fees enough to matter. At this point it's unknown what even 100% adoption would lead to. Maybe 100% adoption of Segwit just leads to more people doing transactions and we're back at square one and again don't have enough capacity.
Remember, neither 1MB or Segwit can actually accommodate widespread adoption and the current growth rate. Crypto is growing faster than either of these can accommodate, so best case might still not be any better.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:59:19
I see no indication that the trading was fake. Also, doing so would be an enormous risk. If it got out (and it probably would... loose lips sink ships), all crypto would crash and Coinbase would lose most of it's value while possibly subjecting itself to existential lawsuits.
Only a small number of people would stand to benefit and they'd arguably risk losing more than they made.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:36:09

How do you feel about decreasing blocksize to 100KB? Surely a permanent solution like LN will work with 100KB blocks too, no?
I don't see the argument against increasing blocksize modestly when the current blocksize is modestly bigger than some arbitrarily small size.
I don't see any mathematical or technological issue that proves 1MB isn't too big, but 4MB is too big.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:33:26
That's shortsighted. There is a real cost for waiting if during that waiting period the network loses reputation, functionality, and adoption. The competition isn't waiting around. Ethereum has more "value" today than Bitcoin has had it's entire lifespan up until just a few months ago. That's significant.
It's like any technology. You don't just put off working on stuff and making small improvements just because your end-game doesn't require them. You need to work on remedying current problems while at the same time hopefully working on long-term solutions.
There is literally no technology that follows the all-or-nothing route. It all slowly improves, accommodates current needs, and slowly moves towards "perfection". Our end-game for TV is maybe something like 16K resolution (who knows) but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have done 2K, 4K, and 8K in the meantime to provide tangible benefits to current users.

Why can't they just sell it and pay you in USD? There is no "safe" way to do this in BTC without risk of the value going down (or up). BTC is too volatile.
The only option would be to ask an exchange like Coinbase if they could do an OTC transaction for you, but I doubt they would.
Your best bet is to have them pay you in BTC and have a contract that says you will immediately sell it and that they will ensure you come away with at least $250K after fees and volatility, and they will make you whole again should it be less.

Even if they worked 50% harder/more, if LN was 9 months away before, it would still be 6 months now.

There is no right or wrong, only consensus and outcome. If the wrong choice was made, you'll only find out after it's too late.
There is a not insignificant amount of people who think a block size increase is needed more than Lightning in the short-term. There are a lot of people who think you'll need a block size increase even with Lightning.

Here's what will happen: They buy an insane amount of options slowly over the span of a few months and slowly sell their shares over a few months, then they'll announce insolvency.
They'll profit and you'll lose everything. Then then they'll buy all the shares at pennies and randomly announce they're going to inject cash and avoid insolvency! Then they'll profit 100x on the way up after everyone else has sold.

What's next? Not much of stretch to say that Bitfinex trades against their own customers with the USDt Tether gives them. They're both the same company anyway.

Most of life is like that though. It's not that big of a problem. There is a number of nodes, not sure of what it is at this point, but there is a number of nodes where it will simply be decentralized, even though not absolutely every last person will be able to.
Also, as of today, there are billions of people who can't run a node. There are hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people who can't even get reliable Internet, but no one seems to mind...

Um, ToS == contract law. Break your contracts and you'll get sued.
Then, depending on how egregious it was, you may wind up running afoul of other "laws" that are more criminal.

I personally don't think it's worth being concerned about that at this point. There is not even the slightest indication that any crypto currency will replace traditional money, and there is no sign that adoption is anywhere near the level needed by someone like Visa.
You just need to scale with adoption. Visa can handle way more transactions than they do. They don't both adding capacity simply because it's not needed. They add capacity as needed.
Right now BTC needs capacity, but it doesn't need the capacity of visa, let alone more than visa.
Block sizes should increase regardless of Lightning. There is no reason whatsoever not to increase blocksize by a reasonable amount.

I'm pretty sure the OP isn't rich. The cost of running a node like the OP is not that much. It's well within the reach of middle-class families and people.
I mean, how many nodes do you really need? Not a 1:1 ratio, that's for sure. BTC works "fine" right now as far as nodes go, and there are barely any nodes at all, relatively speaking.
If BTC takes off in a big way, every small and medium sized business with run nodes. Millions of enthusiasts will run nodes. Non-profits will run nodes. There is really no advantage to every single person on Earth being able to run a node.

To increase block size. It's not a long-term solution, but pretty much all developments in important scientific and engineering fields aren't long-term, complete solutions to problems on day 1. They improve things over time with small changes while working towards the bigger goal.
Increase block size to improve network quality and usability while continuing to work on longer term solutions that scale even better when the needs arise.
LN is a solution to something that doesn't yet exist -- mass adoption and usability. Block size increases are a solution to short-term growth and usability problems and LN will work fine with them as well.

What he said.
The IRS operates like a business. Obtaining tax revenue incurs cost. They aren't going to spend years in court to argue a case in front of a judge that someone who made a very reasonable effort should actually owe a little more.
What they're going to do is go after people where the pay off is huge and more obvious. They're going to go after people who are paying no taxes, have no records, and who make outlandish claims. Those are the people where they're gonna score big.

I think it's very grey because it's not like a stock that split or anything traditional. It's property of some sort and it's odd classifying how you acquired it and what your cost basis would be.
It's worth pointing out that "mining" results in gross income and "found money" is also considered income.
If you bought BTC at 1000, it forked, went to 400 on the old and 800 on the new, and then you sold, what would the cost basis be for the new ones? They're new coins and not at all compatible with the old ones. It's new property. It's also acquired by running some code to access them (much like mining is just running code). In some sense it's even "found". In some sense it's being "given" to you.
It's a very grey area IMO and I really don't know what the IRS would/will do. I'm sure we'll find out soon enough though. Naturally, they'll probably want as much money as possible, so their decision may not be the most logical.

@_date: 2017-12-26 14:20:17
Not really. It's a headache, but it's not complicated. You simply use the value of each crypto at the time of the transaction. It's quite simple actually.
That said, being that most exchanges don't do this for you like most stock brokers do, it could require a lot of work on your part if you haven't been doing it regularly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:03:51
You're missing something here. 
Bitcoin really started to explode in the last few months and has been gaining enormous momentum. However, none of these people have BCH. The forked occurred a long time ago, so Coinbase used with BCH are far outnumbered by new users without any.
Those new users may simply have more buying power than BCH owners have selling power.

Type 3 is questionable at this point, but I believe the incoming tax bills are supposed to restrict like-kind to real estate, so if anyone is planning on doing a swap like that, it would be best to do so under the current tax system.
Type 5 is very questionable. Anyone can fork a chain, but that doesn't mean you are obligated to use it or acknowledge it. You could create infinite tax liability for everyone by just constantly forking.
I believe that you wouldn't have a tax liability on a forked chain until you transacted with the coins.

How much of an impact do you really expect segwit to have from Coinbase users? It's not like Coinbase users are constantly moving small amounts of money in and out. Most coins on Coinbase stay on Coinbase, and all the buys/sells don't hit the main chain anyway.

That's understandable. Unfortunately it's impossible to really determine the best course of action. It's all too interconnected to determine a way that is fair to everyone.

Blockchains aren't predictable. They can hardfork at any time and all sorts of stuff can change.

I don't believe there is any law against using stock to buy another stock. In fact, companies intermingle stock and cash all the time in mergers. It's not easy to transact in stock, but I don't believe there is anything stopping you.
There isn't any institution that prices stock either. The buyers and sellers price stock. The only reason there are difference across crypto exchanges is because it's an immature asset/system. They are close enough in price that the effect would be negligible in determining your cost basis.
The government and courts are not stupid. They will not let you just make up some value for your trade that has no basis in reality. You may or may not be able to argue for a certain exchange's value, but you will most certainly not be able to say "you can't price this so it has no price." There are even laws that prevent you from misrepresenting value.

In fact, I think it would be incredibly dumb for CB to do stuff like that as a company since loose lips sink ships and the first ounce of proof would destroy the exchange, sink all their crypto holdings, and destroy investor value. It's in CB's best interest not to do stuff like that. They make way more money on fees.

The auto industry was probably a "loss", though the US economy gained significantly overall from that "bad" investment. Even if the tax payer lost $20B or something like that, the amount of revenue they collected due to the rescue was far greater when you take into account the effect it had on the economy.
Just think about how many jobs it saved, jobs that generate income tax and spending in other sectors of the economy, which go on to generate more income tax, sales tax, property tax, etc.
It's all a big feedback loop, so really, bailouts were most likely in the best interest of the tax payer at the end of the day.

You're missing the big picture here.
What control the price of Bitcoin? Well, for the most part it's the volume on the biggest exchanges. Manipulation or fraud on a small exchange doesn't really influence prices for the general market.
So imagine if Bitfinex and Binance allowed vast amounts of wash trading and manipulation. This really would effect the prices for everyone. This would mean that now the prices on Reputable Exchange A are the result of fraud/manipulation.
Leaving an exchange you don't like doesn't prevent you from being subject to the same fraud. If Bitfinex could really manipulate the price up or down (and I think they do), then it's likely your BTC, wherever you have them or trade them, are going to reflect that movement.

You're absolutely right, a lot of banks in recent years haven't wanted insane amounts of cash due to low interest rates combined with capital and liquidity rules that have made it unprofitable. They will hold it though if you really want to and they'll charge you fees to do so.
BTW, this dummy had $100M in his savings accounts and the ATM receipt proves it:
So yeah, clearly you're wrong. While most sane people don't keep $300M in excess cash just sitting in a bank account rather than invested in short term treasuries or something, they could it they wanted.
Do most people with hundreds of millions keep it in cash? No. Could they? Sure. Hilariously enough, an ATM receipt proves you can lol

What if Bitfinex borrow $200M for 3 months, deposited it, got the bank statements, and then paid it right back?
Now it looks like they had the money, but in reality they don't.
There is a reason a bank that underwrites a loan doesn't just look at the balance and call it a day. There is no indication of whether or not that balance is typical or not.
Imagine you want a $200K mortgage but you need a $20K downpayment which you don't have. Imagine you borrow $20K from a friend that has to be paid back very quickly and at a high interest rate. So you borrow the $20K and then give it to the bank. Should the bank give you the loan? Probably not because the reality is that you took out a loan solely to get another loan, and this is a completely different risk profile than someone who saved $20K of their own money to buy a house with.

Are you aware people trade currencies just like they trade stocks and bonds? BTC is just another asset. How you use it is irrelevant. The only thing people care about now and for the foreseeable future is how much fiat their BTC is worth.
I, like most people who use exchanges, are buying and selling crypto to obtain more and more fiat. I'm not trying to acquire more BTC. I don't care how much BTC I have, all I care about is that I have more fiat value.
This is what exchanges are for -- to make money/profit.

Bitcoin is definitely far more risky than the SP500. Is it 100x more risky? Dunno, but I don't think anyone would deny it's vastly more risky.

Actually I'm not sure if *you* know anything about investing.
If someone comes to you and says they'd like to invest their nest egg in the SP500, would you also suggest they consider Bitcoin instead? No, of course you wouldn't, because they are two investments with massively different risk profiles. You wouldn't tell an retiree interested in the SP500 that they should also look at Bitcoin because one is extremely risky and volatile, and the other has "market" risk associate with it for the most part and generates income from dividends.
If you think Bitcoin is a suitable substitute for the SP500, then why not suggest the Jan 2020 170 Puts on Apple? I mean, it's just some random thing you *could* theoretically invest in, right?
Better yet, how about some penny stocks? Maybe some ultra complex CDS?
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:49:09
And that's why fees went bonkers in 2017 and the network sucked.
To me a blocksize increase is like putting a bucket under a leak. Sure, maybe it's not the long-term solution and maybe it takes some resources away from other things, but in the meantime you have water entering your house and people slipping on the water.
A blocksize increase would allow Bitcoin to accommodate vastly more transactions than it does now, letting devs work on Lightning or whatever they want *without* having to worry about the network collapsing under its own weight.
The reality is that Bitcoin is simply lucky right now that no one cares about Bitcoin at the moment. Interest has died, transaction volumes have died, volumes in general have died. The only reason Bitcoin isn't completely jammed up again is because people don't care about it so much right now.
If we want people to start using it, we should make it *slightly* usable. The funny thing is, the volume in Dec last year was more or less close to zero in the scope of things. It's not even like Bitcoin really truthfully went parabolic in adoption. Bitcoin was barely even being used relative to what people hope it achieves, yet the network was slowed to a crawl.

In theory you can. It depends what the timeline is.
If we can secure a reasonable cheap and renewable source of energy (and I think we can and will over the next 25-50 years), then mining could become widespread and cheap.
Now you're probably asking, "Why would you mine for free or at a loss?" Well, you'd do it for the same reason you might set up your own email server or contribute to a charity or cause you believe in or buy an insurance policy.
If Bitcoin were to actually become a widely held and used asset (we're talking trillions of real value in regular use), then it's safe to assume that large corporations or wealthy people would probably hold large amounts of it at any given time. Now, if the value of your holdings (let's say you're Google and have $50B worth of Bitcoin) is really dependent on the functioning and security of the network, wouldn't you invest the capital to mine for "free"?
The reward for mining needn't be directly financial. The reward for mining is the network itself. It's insurance. It's security. For the same reason you'd pay a bank to hold your money rather than carry it around with you everywhere, you will incur some expense to mine bitcoin for the sake of your holdings themselves.

Sure, there are some, but I believe current technology can account for some of the trade-offs and future technology even more so.
The biggest complaints people make are things like increased centralization, hardware requirements, network latency, connection speed requirements.
I personally see no reason why every person needs to be a node. Naturally there will be some regional centralization, but that's fine. You don't expect low income people in Africa to run their own webservers, so why should they *need* to run a node? I can afford to host my own "Cloud" if I really wanted to, but the reality is that my connection to my cloud services are just not as good as Amazon who replicates and places my data all over the world. I accept that there are some services I just shouldn't be the one providing and that there are many others more than capable and willing to do so. Fortunately running nodes is very cheap and very easy.
There are more than enough wealthy people and companies in the world, the majority of which are overwhelmingly good-natured, to achieve decentralization with higher technical requirements. I mean, if it really a big deal if you have to spend $200/month on some faster Internet and more storage?
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:41:05
That's because microtransactions are highly undesirable.
Think about data, for example. Your ISP knows more or less exactly how much data you use, in real time. They don't want to bill you every MB, 1000 times per day. That would be an accounting nightmare. They want to bill you at a reasonable rate.
Look at electricity. Your utility company could bill you 10x per day, but they are totally fine with once per month. They also don't want to increase their transaction count by 300x.
How about Uber? People talk about transactions per mile. Why would Uber want that when it works totally fine just billing you at the end of the trip in a single transaction? What do they gain by billing 14 times per trip?
Microtransactions are not the future. Companies much prefer post-pay or loading and account with some set amount of money/data/resource that they subtract from in real time...

I'm not disagreeing with you. I've been selling since the ATH and even before it.
I was simply saying that yes, a huge amount of interested people bought in Dec and got wiped out. This is very bad for the market. They are probably not coming back. They FOMO'd and took the loss and are now most likely gone.
The volumes are very low again and I can tell you with much certainty that new users signing up at major exchanges have plummeted. The amount of new money coming into crypto is so much smaller now than it was in Nov and Dec.

Yes, some stuff is very stable and it's because of large, local markets and production.
So long as there is no natural market for BTC, it probably will never be stable. The prices of things in BTC will most likely constantly fluctuate just like if you priced things in terms of gold.
I'd bet you that for the next 365 days, the price of a can of coke from a vending machine will be $1. I'll also bet you that 10 minutes from now, the price of a can of coke from that vending machine will change if you price it in BTC or Euro or Gold.
It doesn't make sense to talk about price stability with respect to foreign currency, and BTC is the ultimate foreign currency. This is a huge problem for BTC and crypto in general in terms of commerce. Apple doesn't constantly change the prices of their products in different markets. It's 999 Euro today and probably 999 Euro tomorrow, even though EUR could go down against USD. They only do it when prices drop massively, like when the Rubble tanked.

So why hasn't anyone successfully acted nefariously with the current chain? I mean, if you're going to try anything, now (or maybe in the last few years) is your chance. Eventually it will be simply unrealistic for any bad actor to be successful.
The reason no one has successfully attacked Bitcoin yet is because it's already too expensive. How many millions or billions of dollars are you going to spend just to *try*? People with that much money simply have better things to do. Google could in theory attack Bitcoin right now if they really wanted to, but the reality is Google makes so much money that they have vastly better things to do.
The people and companies with this level of wealth have better way to make money. The only incentive to attack Bitcoin is to kill it, not to profit IMO.

For BCH it is perhaps irrelevant, but for BTC it was very relevant and considerable harm was done to the general perception of Bitcoin back in Dec/Jan when the network more or less broke for commerce.
When you hype up this fast, secure, cheap payment network and then everyone's shit gets stuck or held hostage by insane fees, all you do is harm the reputation of the technology.

Consider when you get a mortgage. They look at home much money you have in your bank account. If they see a large transaction in recently, like $30K, they don't necessarily take that into account because for all they know you just borrowed $30K from someone to deposit in your account for the underwriters and now you're going to pull it back out after you get your loan!

Do you feel the effects of the network grinding to a halt in Dec were quite harmful to perception of it?
Imagine if a website gets popular and then suddenly it becomes completely unusable. Do you just spend your time optimizing code and writing more efficient systems, or do you just hurry up and add capacity before people get turned off?
What happened with fees was a huge turn-off to people. It showed that this fantastic new speculative digital cash isn't cheap or quick to use. That was a massive black eye for Bitcoin and now every news site in the world says "Look at what happened to fees in Dec, see how bad this is?!"
No company would ever let their user experience suffer to the point of pushing away users by the masses.

I woke up one morning and did a $300K transaction from my bed. Bought $300K in the morning, sold it later that afternoon. That would be more or less impossible with how you describe, not to mention most likely impossible since it wouldn't be done in cash and funds couldn't clear.
Lots of people have lots of money. They can't invest doing a bunch of cash transactions with a bunch of random people. They have millions of dollars to transact in and transact in often.

I think your Bitcoin is only as secure as your resistance to pain and hardship (physical or emotional). If they think you have X amount of Bitcoin and they show up at your house and haul you off to a gulag until you transfer them at least X-1 BTC, what are you going to do? Hodl out? (pun intended)

A smart contract wouldn't be sufficient because you can't control where they put newly acquired funds or assets.

Bitcoin doesn't grow 75% or so every 6 months though. In fact, it's down 75% in the last 6 months (or whatever the massive loss has been).
Also, you had to buy Bitcoin very, very early on to have those zillion percent gains. Those gains are long since gone and will never happen again.
Let's just do something reasonable and look at the last 5 years. Let's say you bought Bitcoin at $500 at some point in 2013. You're up about 13x. Let's look at Netflix in 2013. It's also up about 13x and with much lower volatility.
Will Netflix go up another 13x? Probably not. Will Bitcoin? Let's say it does. Well, I guarantee you that over the next 5 years some small tech company will also go up 13x. It's not that uncommon. Nvidia was up 20x in the last 5 years, so it actually possibly did better than Bitcoin. Facebook has also gone up 10x in valuation in the last 5 years.
Bitcoin is just an asset like a stock option is an asset. If you want the chance to make 75% (or lose 75%) every 6 months, there are always stock options available. When one expires another one is opened.
It doesn't really matter if you can or can't hold a single option forever since Bitcoin can go to 0 as well, at which point it doesn't matter is Bitcoin "expires" or not because it has no value.
Investing/trading is about risk reward. There is nothing terrible unique about Bitcoin's risk/reward profile. You can find risk/reward profile in the financial markets that can accommodate just about any size investment.

Why are you comparing an asset from its infancy to index funds that hold blue chip companies that are so far along in their life that they are already public?
Why not compare the return on Bitcoin to the return on investing in Amazon or FB on day 1? Peter Theil invested like $500K into FB and made billions. That's like 2000x. Mark Zuckerberg invested probably $1000 of his own actual money and made $80B. Jeff Bezos is worth more than all of Bitcoin in existence due to his "investment" in Amazon early on.
You're asking for a traditional investment that moves like Bitcoin. You're right, there isn't one. Why? Well, Bitcoin *isn't* a traditional investment! If you want to see non-traditional investments that *could* move like Bitcoin, I can show you a ton. "Picking" Bitcoin as your investment is no different than picking a single stock! There is no diversification!
This is why the OPs comparison and your comparison is stupid. Bitcoin isn't a traditional asset with the same beta as traditional assets, so why even make a pointless comparison?
If you're willing to make non-traditional investments like Bitcoin, why not make non-traditional investments in other financial instruments? I'll tell you why -- because you have no idea what you're actually doing and don't probably have a clue about any of these other instruments. Bitcoin is speculative investments for dummies.

See though, that's the real measure of risk.
I'm all for putting some money in crypto since the risk/reward is pretty appealing, but it's only appealing up to a certain point because the risk become more defined when large amounts are at stake.
The thing about investing is that it's about total dollars earned, not percent. It's actually not that hard to make enormous gains on small amounts of money. In fact, I'd have made an insane amount of money had I bet the farm on all my speculative bets. The problem though is that if you can't really put all your money into something, then the risk/reward isn't as good as it seems.

Dunno, I've moved millions of dollars of my own money with no notice. Not $300M, but definitely $5-10M, and I'm just some random guy with no real business connection to a bank.
Brokerages specifically don't have problems with very large transfers.
Sure, some security department might contact you, but that's about it. If you're known to move large amounts of money, they let you move large amounts of money, especially if it's between accounts you often transfer money to.

Who said it wasn't their fault? Bitcoin is inherently a risky asset to hold and transact with. The reality is that the vast majority of users of Coinbase don't have significant problems.
You take a risk keeping money on and exchange just like you take a risk on localbitcoins. I'd feel safer selling Bitcoin on Coinbase than meeting such stranger in real life.

Yes, but let's just use a quick example: Say I want pass $1 along from one account to the next, over and over, in a big circle until the $1 has been transfer 3,000,000 times today.

Perhaps not yet, until they turn over the requested data, but it's just as bad: It proves that a coin whose value is based on the idea of reserves wasn't actually backed by those reserve and that they kept lying about it.

As of right now, assuming they are still down $850M, USDT is backed more like 1:1.4

And as I was saying -- the market is notorious for ignoring the signs. 2007-2008 is a great example. How come billions of people get wrecked? The market was all that matters and was unmoved... until they weren't and Lehman exploded.
And the market isn't unmoved. USD is down 5% vs USDt on Bitfinex. Every USD on Bitfinex is taking a 4-5% haircut right now. Imagine if your bank said "We can only give you 95% of your money." That's a very bad sign and this time it's coming with pure evidence from the NY AG.
BTW: Look at the USD/USDt order book on BFX and tell me the market is unmoved. 
@_date: 2019-04-29 22:18:27
NYAG has proof Tether was $850M short on reserves. Isn't that a big deal? Remember when banks and hedge funds said their mortgage backed securities were fairly valued... until they weren't and turned out to actually be junk?

The same way you rationalize the confidence in any company/financial instrument before it explode and 1% say I told you so and 99% lose their shirt.
Add into the mix that crypto is way less regulated and the community way less sophisticated and you have a recipe for disaster.
Honest question: Tether claims the $850M loan to Bitfinex should be valued at $850M. Do you believe that valuation for the debt on Tether's balance sheet is fair and do you believe it's a good idea for Tether to get to value that asset given that it and BFX are owned by the same people?
@_date: 2019-04-29 22:01:31
No because you should be extremely fearful if you have assets on Bitfinex. When the value of USD starts being worth 5% less than USDt and they are both owned by the same company, does that not seriously worry you?
USDt and USD are supposed to be stable. They are supposed to be USD. When they start to act strange, that's a pretty big deal.

Yeah, and there should be an asset worth $90 out there somewhere. Banks generally make loans against "assets".
If I go chop down a tree and build a house, I have created an asset which can be taken as collateral for a loan.
The bank takes your $100, keeps $10, and loans $90 against the newly built house. Now if you ask for your $100, they only have $10 and a $90 house.
The world has a growing population, an insane amount of natural resources, and enormous amounts of renewable energy/resources that can be converted into things of value through "labor", which is really just a conversion of natural resources into some other form. It makes a lot of sense to create money when you're creating all sorts of things of value out of thin air...

That's fine, because if each BTC is $5M, then you'd need $100-500M to have 1-5% exposure to Bitcoin. If you have $10M, 1-5% exposure is only .02-.1 BTC. So no problem there either.

Currency's purpose is to make it easy to monetize human labor in a versatile way. So long as we are growing our population and using labor (energy + natural resources), we need to be able to create money to quantify these new things of value.
Imagine you go out and build a new house tomorrow from some trees you chopped down and metal you mined. How are you going to sell that house when there is a fixed supply of money? Where is this money going to come from? You created an asset of significant value seemingly out of thin air and now you need to be able to represent that equity in something useful.
People misunderstand fractional reserve banking. They are assuming we are just printing money, but in reality we are (should) be printing money only so that we can quantify an underlying asset in a meaningful way. And the reality is that we are still growing assets (human labor + natural resources + energy).
There can be no logical creation of credit with a deflationary currency. You could not lend money with positive interest rates.

You're assuming a sort of zero sum game with currency. That's really not the point of currency. Currency is supposed to provide liquidity in a versatile form. We use currency to replace complicated forms of bartering.
Bitcoin can not provide liquidity and thus cannot provide credit in a meaningful way. Yes, in theory an individual could pay back a loan with interest so long as he was able to get that interest from someone else. This however is not sustainable on a large scale given population and economic growth, and the creation of new "assets" out of thin air (people/energy/natural resources).
Bitcoin cannot replace fiat money because it has no capacity for liquidity. Bitcoin could exist alongside fiat as some sort of digital commodity, but it really cannot replace it as a currency. It's a very bad currency.

Um, Apple has $6B in *daily* volume. You think you can't sell short a fraction of a percent of a company like Apple or Google? Of course you can, just no one really does it.
Like I said, just go look at the order book. Bitcoin has a total value of $70B, yet a mere $40M sell order on Coinbase would drop the price to $1000. Think about that. A $40M sell of a $70B asset (.05%) would drop the price by 75%.
If you can't sell $40M of a stock of a company with a $70B market cap without dropping the value of the stock by 75%, then you have no liquidity.
The true measure of liquidity is not simply daily volume. No one cares about the ability of two people to trade 1 BTC back and forth. Real liquidity is about the volatility and order book. Bitcoin cannot handle any meaningfully large trades because the real demand is a lot smaller than the volume indicates.

Maybe you're just not very wealthy and don't have a concept of what is and isn't a lot of money.
How are you supposed to trade if you don't keep your coins and money on an exchange? You're going to constantly move stuff back and forth at a moments notice to buy/sell a dip?

No, it crashed because it ran out of FOMO-suckers who bid it up nonsensically in Dec.
Just look at the search volume for all things crypto. Search volume in Dec was 10-15x higher than it is now. This means way less buyers, hence way less demand.
Price dropped because there just aren't enough buyers to sustain it.

So then the weekend only slows down "new users" and "new money". All the old money is already there and just doesn't want to buy. And being that new users growth is down like 90% since Nov/Dec, the new users won't have much of an effect anyway compared to those already there looking to sell.
1 new user can't buy up all the volume from 10 current users looking to sell. The volume of new users right now is highly irrelevant and not going to make much of a difference on the weekend.

I don't doubt that they do move together to some extent, but I do question the function that relates the two given the potential for liquidity issues between them. The exchanges have barely any liquidity at all, whereas futures that are cash-settled could have vastly more. Add into the mix that exchanges aren't connected and highly manipulated, and that Bitcoin exchanges and the network itself are too slow to actually dissolve the price differences. After all, Bitcoin futures from CME are based on prices from only certain exchanges.
I simply don't think it's possible for someone of extreme wealth, like Bill Gates, to short a significant amount of Bitcoin in a way that is actually fair to him. What happens if you go short, and then bitfenix is manipulated or another exchange, to spike the price? 
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:46:40
LOL. That's because there is a mathematical limit to transactions, and until you hit that limit, fees stay low. If transaction requests went up to Dec 2017 levels, fees would explode again.
Right now tx volume is similar to Jan 2017. So, a I said, no one is using Bitcoin still, thus super low fees.

@_date: 2018-03-15 05:13:37
So what? The max potential value, realistically speaking, is not very high for BTC. Even if BTC was $1M, that's not very much. Would you rather have 1 BTC or a mansion on the coast of California?

When you sell something short, you are actually selling something. They are (should be) sourced from other long positions.
It's not about the offset of buying and selling, it's about the timing of the buying and selling.
I agree that derivatives can have a big effect, but that effect likely is not present in the crypto markets. The amount of high frequency and quant traders in crypto is tiny compared to the traditional markets. I don't see a flash crash like that happening in crypto because of how disjointed the market is.

If SpaceX figured out some breakthrough in propulsion that was extremely quick, ok, that would a game changer. But rockets? I mean, we need rockets, but there is lot more to figuring out civilization beyond Earth than just getting up into space.
That's not to diminish what SpaceX has done. They've done some amazing things, but it's only a small piece of the puzzle and NASA is working on a many different, very large sections of the puzzle. We need a hell of a lot more than just rockets if we ever plan to get off this rock.

@_date: 2019-01-07 18:18:58
Uh, they are non-deliverable, thus it's not really a short.
Being short BTC on CME is the equivalent of betting with me directly on the price of Bitcoin for cash. It's not a real short like stocks or other deliverable assets.
Consider this: I go short from $12500 for $1B. Now I want to buy back my short at $6250. I just give you $500M. It has no effect on the actual price of BTC because the contract isn't deliverable. They are cash settled. I can buy/sell infinite amounts while having no direct effect on the price via supply/demand.
It's not a real short.

Yes, because one is more of a long-term purchase that is useful and common in everyday life. While a TV isn't an investment, it's not indicative of carelessness or making bad/risky investments. It doesn't really tell you much at all about their decision making skills. Maybe they just needed a new TV after 10 years because there other one broke.
Buying crypto is a highly speculative investment and buying it with a CC indicates already poor decision making because fees are absurd on most exchanges and bank transfers are the intelligent way to buy. Buying with a CC is indicative of the FOMO, and that is the definition of high risk decision making.
I'd say someone buying a 54 in TV on a credit card is way lower risk than someone buying crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:26:42
Yes and no. Many people don't have enough to make it worth the hassle, and many people who have lots of coins on exchanges do so because they do in fact what to be able to trade them.
Exchanges don't need to offer these solutions. There are plenty of wallets for people to choose from. If they're too lazy to spend time learning about wallets and such, then they shouldn't be buying crypto in the first place.

Which further illustrates my point: you can't fairly short Bitcoin because crypto is an unregulated, unconnected mess of manipulation and fraud.
I can drop the price on one major exchange while having no effect on the other exchanges. So then, how do I know my futures/derivatives are not being manipulated on single exchanges?

The problem is that you'd have a deflationary currency in a world of growing population and improving technology. I don't see how you could avoid massive deflation in that scenario.

One of the most important questions they didn't ask was "Do you have any estimates about how much money is actually invested?"
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:17:58
That's just not true so far out because the volumes are actually quite low at any given time. Unlike a stock market, no one is buying $50M of crypto with a market order on Gdax.
The order book matters when the size is relevant to the volume.
Lets look at the order book from current price to $5000. Gdax says lets say 10K BTC can be sold. So yes, if you in theory puts in a 10K BTC order it would eat it up instantly and thus the order book mattered. However, the reality is that exchanges really don't have that kind of participants. When is the last time you saw a 10K BTC market order?
So yeah, the order book so far out from the price just doesn't matter because there is ample time for it to change.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:08:23
Because you'll ruin your credit and it will cost you 50x as much later on.
Default on a CC then apply for a mortgage. Assuming you get approved, you're now talking about several percentage points higher in rate. Sure, a few percent doesn't seem like much, but on a $250K loan over 30 years, it will cost you $200K in interest.

There will always be outliers, but my comment and JPM's position on the matter is definitely focused on the credit risk people.

If they can't earn enough or save enough fiat, how can they earn/save enough BTC? The barrier to entry for the poor and low income stays the same regardless of whether they have fiat or USD because they live paycheck to paycheck and have absolutely nothing left at the end of the day to invest.
Anyone can easily invest in stocks or commodities. It's very easy and cheap. Inflation is like 2% *per year*. Any amount they'd need to accumulate before being able to invest would be meaninglessly lower by the time they could do so. Stock transactions go through instantly. Real estate can go through as quick as you can get the money. You can get approved for a mortgage within a few days.

Also, banks no the credit profile and risk for people making large purchases from Best Buy. You're assuming that people buying TVs are the same ones buying crypto.
Maybe they aren't. Maybe banks are seeing 5x as many chargebacks from crypto purchases. Maybe they're seeing 5x as much fraud.
Banks have lots of information on the credit risk associated with their clients. They are stopping these transactions for a reason. Notice they did not say anything about stopping bank transfers and debit card transactions. This is aimed at credit cards and it's aimed at them for a very obvious reason.

Just look at hiring. I'm had 4 contractors come out for construction work. There is no way an AI could have arrived at the same conclusions I did about why I should and shouldn't hire one. It was how they talked, how they behaved, what kind of stuff they said/showed that seemed off. It's like a job interview. My friend works for Apple and he had like 12 interviews with all sorts of people throughout the process. It wasn't just a computer test.
As for marketing, I do a lot of marketing for my own company. As of today, I see no indication that an AI is anywhere near as capable as I am. They can't make creatives in photoshop, they can't get on the phone with clients, they can't pitch clients...
Think of it this way. How many current multi-billion dollar skyscrapers are run by AI? If they aren't, why aren't they? Surely the owners have the funds to do so and surely they have the same incentive to move in that direction as a decentralized group of owners would.

That's fine, because if each BTC is $5M, then you'd need $100-500M to have 1-5% exposure to Bitcoin. If you have $10M, 1-5% exposure is only .02-.1 BTC. So no problem there either.
There is really no realistic price of BTC where rich people care about having more BTC than is readily available available. They'll pretty much always be able to get as much as they need, and if they can't, it's because they have no need for it anyway. Like Bezos or Brin or Gates or Zuckerberg.

There are like 7 people in the entire world who won't do business with you if you don't accept BTC. Everyone else will just pay in fiat like normal.
Honestly, I'd be shocked if any merchants of significant size actually accepted BTC. All they do is convert the fiat price at that moment to BTC and then use a payment channel that gives them fiat for the BTC they collected.

Well, assuming there is demand for new gold, there is a significant cost to mining. It's definitely not free or cheap to get gold out of the Earth.
I wouldn't underestimate the jewelry aspect. There are many assets that are valued beyond their physical qualities at first glance. Art and collectibles are great examples of this. The real/originals things could be orders of magnitude more than perfect copies that really would serve the same purpose.
If shiny, yellow, noncorroding alloys were good substitutes, jewelry stores wouldn't bother stocking gold jewelry. People want gold though, for whatever reason. Just like people want natural diamonds even though you can create chemically perfect diamonds in a lab.

No, you shouldn't. 800 credit score doesn't mean dick. The guy with the highest credit score ever recorded wasn't Bill Gates believe it or not. It wasn't Jeff Bezos or any other super wealth person. It was just some random, middle class guy for whom the formula spit out the best number.
A high credit score doesn't mean you're intelligent or even that you make good financial decisions. It simply means you've been paying on time... until one day you don't.

That's not the point though. The point is that assets are assets, and can be converted to other assets quite easily.
Whether you have 1 BTC worth $5M or 1 mansion worth $5M, you have $5M of net worth/value. You can't pay for groceries with a mansion and you can't live in a BTC. Both may or may not go up or down in value, and both can somehow be drawn upon to take ownership of other assets.
If Jeff Bezos never owns a single BTC, why would he care? His AMZN stock is worth $125B, or 100B Euro, or 25K BTC @ $5M, or 125B cheeseburgers, or anything really. Value does not have a type. It has value that can be discussed in terms of anything you want.
So it doesn't matter if millionaires can't all have 1 BTC because BTC is just an asset. 1 BTC @ $5M isn't any more valuable than 10M Twinkies @ $.50.

By responding directly to this comment and not the original post, the comment assumes that the movement was financial in nature since he was talking about making money and green candles, but only with respect to that comment.
My overall opinion is that it's just some exchange moving coins probably, but *if* someone is talking about it being trading related (green candles) then I'm saying it would probably be selling BTC.

Where does the money come from when ATT needs to make payroll every two weeks for 300K employees?
What does Amazon do with all the revenue they take in for 3rd parties? They certainly don't pay it out daily...
Do they sweep every last penny daily into treasuries, never having a drop of cash left over for operating expenses and accounts payable?
The reality is, if you want to hold a large amount of cash in a bank, you can. They may charge you a fee, but they will do it. There is literally no law that prevents you from keeping cash in a bank account.

Do you now understand why it's not your money and why you don't get to determine if or how you can spend it?
The credit is unsecured, so go ahead, don't pay for it. They probably won't even sue you. What will happen is that $2000 of credit you decided not to pay back will end up costing you $200K in interest when you try to get a mortgage, if you can even get a mortgage.

No one uses wire transfers for small payments like that. There are a million more reasonable options for stuff like that. Paypal for example charges no fees for that. ACH is also possible, though excessive for something like this.
You could write a check for free or something like that. More and more banks nowadays offers P2P solutions and more will come. Most people in the US would either just give their friend $10 cash at some point or they'd buy lunch next time. Most likely though would be that your friend just pays for lunch because he's your friend and it's only $10.

Yes, I've bought and sold lots.
Who exactly needs security in this transaction? Real estate has titles. A thief cannot convey good title. Real estate is a large, fixed and immovable asset. You cannot be scammed out of real estate. There is no security risk to the seller in these transactions and the buyer would gain nothing by making an untraceable, irreversible transaction.
The costs associated with buying real estate are largely agent fees and things like title insurance.
There are barely any fees associated with real estate if you just do a direct seller-buyer transaction. 
There is literally nothing about real estate that benefits from crypto purchases. The seller only benefits if it's fraudulent, and the buyer is much worse off since it would be hard to get your money back in the event of fraud. There is no benefit to an honest sell and honest buyer.

Show me a product or service that doesn't change price in BTC for considerable amounts of time. In other words, what your buying costs .000271 BTC every day, not fluctuating with the value in fiat.
When I go to Overstock or Neweggs, the amount of BTC I need to make a purchase fluctuates constantly with the exchange rate of fiat because, like I said, no one actually prices in BTC. It has no stability. The amount of BTC I need to pay now is 3% higher than it was 24 hours ago.

As of right now, Ether for all intents and purposes is being used in all the same ways at Bitcoin, plus more. I can't see into the future to know how they each ultimately evolve, but so far Ether seems more than comparable to Bitcoin.

If it was easy enough to buy, I would. That said, you don't need to own the SP500 to be diversified. It's a pain in the ass and BCH showed up with little to no effort.
A study was done last year that showed buying equal amounts of every single ICO yielded 1200% gains. No idea what that gain is now, but I'm sure it's still pretty damn good.
I for one have no idea what any of this shit will ultimately be worth and I also don't care. I'm willing to sell it all in a moments notice and let it go to $0 and disappear. All I want to own at the end of the day are assets of value -- bitcoin, shitcoin, usd, stocks, real estate... doesn't matter to me so long as it has a lot of value.

WTF are you talking about? I own privately run companies. As majority owner I can issue shares to whoever I want for whatever I want. I can sell them, I can give them for free, I can pretty much do whatever I want with them given the articles of association and shareholder agreement. And no, they didn't cost me anything initially and they didn't cost my partners anything either. We create them out of thin air and sometimes create more out of thin air.
I can then sell those shares to private investors or in theory I could have an IPO and get shares valued that way.
An IPO is completely irrelevant to the price of shares in any company. If you were best buds with Jeff Bezos way back when, he could have just gifted you Amazon shares for your birthday if he really wanted to.

I personally would never go to Bitcoin.com. Those kinds of domains are rarely quality sites. It would be like going to stocks.com or computers.com
In any case, having just looked at Bitcoin.com, while I think some stuff is a bit fanboy-ish, I don't see anything confusing. They have the prices for each on the page, they have the widely recognized tickers, and they refer to BTC as Bitcoin Core. They differentiate between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash, thus if you're a newbie and spend 2 minutes reading about your investment, it's not going to be a problem.
If you can't bring yourself to educate yourself for 10 minutes, then you deserve to make stupid mistakes and lose your money.

Meaningless chart. Bitcoin could have went from $1 to $10 and the chart would look the similar.
The reality is that even with that specific time frame, Berkshire has added vast more value than Bitcoin. It's gone from $250B to $500B, whereas Bitcoin is only at $160B right now.
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:42:15
And Berkshire was worth $0 at some point too. What's your point in comparing something that's been around forever to something that has been around 9 years? Of course the relative return on something that's only been around 9 years could greatly outpace a massive company that's been around 50.
You could have bought Bitcoin near $0 just like you could have invested in any company near $0 if you were in the right time and place. Jeff Bezos' Amazon stock is worth like $130B. You too could have $130B if he had sold you some stock early on and held it. Obviously the only difference is that you had a better chance of being able to buy Bitcoin than investing in some private company.
I can actually give you better return that Bitcoin. You write some "Hello World" code for me and I'll give you 100% of a company that has $10K in cash on its balance sheet. Now you'll have turned a more or less $0 investment into $10K, which is arguably a large return than Bitcoin which went from $0 to $9300 as of writing this.
Does that mean much? Not really. The reality is that Berkshire has create more wealth for people overall than Bitcoin in these last 9 years and it generates cash flow.
It's just not a meaningful comparison to make -- an actual company vs a psuedo-commodity-currency.
Question: What would you rather own, 100% of Berkshire or 100% of all Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:49:15
Holding any crypto at all is a huge risk. It's smart to hold BCH as a hedge. In fact, it's performed just fine as well. Many people think it's worth zero, yet here it is worth $1500 today. No one can predict this.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:24:58
It is the network's fault because it's poorly designed. Imagine if Gmail didn't have good spam filters. Would it be Gmail's fault that you get spam? No, but it would be Gmail's fault for being a poorly designed system since it can't cope with the obvious problems associated with the service.
If the network can be spammed into stalling like this, then it's poorly designed and/or broken to begin with.
What if the entire world started using Bitcoin today? The network would collapse completely as billions of transactions tried to get through every day.
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:47:13
It says the price of each. It's impossible to get it wrong unless you literally have no idea what you're doing, in which case you have no business buying it anyway. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:58:25
But that's not what happened here. Here you'd be guilty of not paying attention to what you're doing. I mean, it says quite clearly BCH and BTC, and it shows the price of each.
If you literally have no idea which ticker you want and what the price of the coin is that you want, then it's not fraud.
Also, BCH is up against BTC, so damages wouldn't even exist for the most part.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:53:46
It's OK by me. It's obvious which you're buying and if you have no idea which is which, you shouldn't be buying in the first place.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:59:40
Well I wish you luck! Just make sure you set aside enough cash in case they tell you that you owe the taxes and they don't qualify. I have a feeling you're going to get an automatic audit. Just my opinion.
One thing to consider though: Why did you not just pay taxes normally and then wait for clarity at which point you could possibly amend your returns? If you did it that way, worst case is some opportunity cost and you'll just get the money back later once they make it official or set precedence. By claiming like-kind before you know it flies, you open yourself up to significant penalties and interest.
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:49:15
If this is true, their lawyers are totally fleecing them LOL. What a bunch of fucking idiots. They won't even be able to prove damages.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:18:09
Well, unless you're assuming large blocks would get immediately filled with proportionally more transactions, then what else could be the issue?
I don't know what the ideal blocksize is, but I know it's a heck of a lot more than 1MB given modern technology.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:00:26
Or just increase blocksize to make spamming a network pointless. Even wealthy spammers will only throw so much money down the drain per day before realizing it's pointless.
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:20:43
You're right that it's not really the same, but I view Ethereum as more powerful than Bitcoin and the code of both can change, so who knows what happens to each in the future.
There are very few industries on the planet dominated by a single source of something or single entity. I see no reason why Bitcoin would be unique in this regard.
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:20:04
Where is the fraud? It's clearly labeled.
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:45:33
It says BCH and BTC, and it says the value of each. What more do you want? You'd literally have to have no idea what you're doing to get it wrong, and if that's the case, that's your own fault and the blame is 100% on you. You'll never win in court.
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:55:23
I mean, he truly believes BCH is the real Bitcoin (which is fair I guess), but he clearly states BCH, BTC, and the price of each. It's pretty difficult to get this wrong when buying.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:27:03
Because Bitcoin users have never screwed up and been (permanently) locked out of their wallets lol
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:54:01
It's worth $1500 right now afaik...
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:10:34
People donate to charity, so what's the difference?
Also, if Bitcoin goes global, then it won't even matter since companies like JPM and Google and Amazon and whoever would also probably have billions dedicated to it since they will depend on the security of it too.
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:09:55
Whether it's spam or not, why is the network such a POS that it can't cope with a little spam?
Imagine how much spam the network will see with 7B users...
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:13:04
Fees have been next nothing for months now and it hasn't stopped people from mining. Also, I'd think that securing the network is in every miner's interest if they're holding large amount of Bitcoin. The flipside is they stop mining, the system is attacked, and their Bitcoin plummets in value.
Assuming Bitcoin ever reaches critical mass, the reason to mine it would be for the sake of your own money and investment. Mining becomes like insurance.
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:04:34
Why do you assume "banks" care about power or control? They are not owned by any single significant person or shareholder. Ownership is highly fragmented. The CEOs come and go, make a bunch of money, and don't give a crap after they leave. The either move onto something else or retire filthy rich.
As for the government, well, do you think Bitcoin becoming a global currency would give the Chinese government any less control or power over their people?  I mean, governments do have armies...
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:02:13
Here's a question for you: If they asked you why you were trading coins against each other, what would you tell them?
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:34:45
How so? Assets are assets. They have value in whatever form you want.
How is Bezos more powerful with $150B of Bitcoin vs $150B of Amazon stock?
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:41:23
I don't understand anything you just said.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:51:11
So are you actually filling out form 8824 to declare each like-kind trade?
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:05:10
Well, for starters it's to illustrate that there is less "new money" interest. Secondly, people just search brand names and keywords all the time, then click the link they want. Everyone knows the site is Amazon.com, but they still just type Amazon into Google and click the top link.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:39:43
If an exchange isn't highly regulated, it means you run the risk of being ripped off by the exchange.
I'd be shocked if Kraken hasn't been front running for years.
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:29:15
Well, there are many examples of things that have returned far more value than gold.
A handful of tech companies from the last 20-30 years of civilization are worth probably something like 30% of all gold ever mined in thousands of years of civilization.

Check out the graph for "Coinbase" or "how to buy bitcoin". Same thing. Interest has croaked.
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:10:33
If you go to Canada, they still call them dollars. If you go to Hong Kong, they still call them dollars. They differentiate between them via the same method: CAD, USD, HKD
Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are not the same as the very first version of Bitcoin. They've both been changed (improved?). So really, at this point, people can call them whatever they want so long as the differentiate them reasonably. The terms BCH and BTC do just that, as do the prices shown when interacting.
If you entered a contract to sell 10 "Bitcoin" for USD, you wouldn't just assume the contract means the Bitcoin that is near $9000. You would absolutely have to put BTC and/or specify more characteristics such that the contract was bulletproof and you couldn't get screwed by someone trying to give you the fork that you don't want.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:25:44
Question then: What is the importance of keeping the entire chain? Why does anyone need parts of the chain from years ago?
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:24:22
Of course it is, just like you have to point your satellite dish in the right direction. If you don't want to cover a country with the signal, you don't point at that country.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:48:53
Uh, you do realize that countries tend to believe they "own" their airspace and the spectrum in those airspaces, right? Not to mention those satellites aren't even in any country's official territory.
If you start "broadcasting" into another country's airspace, they have every right to shoot your satellite down. You have no right to transmit data into another country and interfere with their country/government/laws.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:39:53
Consider two scenarios:
1. Original chain as it is now. I move my coins 100 times and end up at address X. I now send my coins to myself at address X again, ensuring there has been no double spend attempts etc. I'm certain my coins are safe, so to say.
2. Pruned, hypothetical chain starts with my coins at address X.
How are these different to the actual user? If I can be certain my coins are safe and have proved it by sending them to myself. The history is now irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:09:50
There's really no point to that. If merchants aren't getting BTC from you, then it's not a BTC transaction.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:10:48
BTC trend looks the same, does it not?
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:17:03
Hey, does anyone know if BTC scales yet? Can't imagine satellites get much use for all 500 transactions per day the BTC network can handle
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:24:49
It's not an act of war to shoot down a private satellite...
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:07:29
Easily doable with modern technology. Very cheap to do as well.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:20:25
Heading towards it? I guess, but it's likely you are $3000 away from it.

Anywhere... except China, Russia, and any other country who tells them not to. Don't expect China to let them beam down Internet to their country.

Wash trading applies to securities, not to Bitcoin. I see no evidence that you have to apply wash trading rules to Bitcoin.

Who cares? Every return on investment looks like that if you start at inception of near $0 initial investment.
Start creating a website today with Google ads. Total cost? Probably close to $0 if you already have a computer. Grow it and now suddenly you're making $10K/year on a $0 investment. Infinity % gain!
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:08:54
That's the thing: It doesn't work, so why bother banning it?

But do you have a graph of hash power as well? The true profitability for miners will be based on difficulty.

@_date: 2018-12-18 00:23:25
So you're fine with the fact that fees exploded in the last year and the network got panned by the entire media that Bitcoin was slow and unusable rather than just the simple fix to accommodate people?
Not doing that simple fix made hundreds of millions of people think Bitcoin won't work.

Let's just make 1KB blocks and do everything on LN!!!11
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:16:21
It would be just as cheap with 32MB blocks and it would be secured on-chain.
The whole raspberry pi thing is retarded. 5B poor people don't need to run node or have the entire blockchain. There are 7B people in the world, and more than enough can afford to support reasonable size blocks.
You're talking about Bitcoin being worth trillions. Don't you think every multi-millionaire and billionaire would be will to spend a couple hundred a month to have a decent internet connection and some storage space?
We don't need 7B people running nodes. It's pointless.

What's there to fucking learn? People either use it in commerce or they don't. There is nothing worth learning about Bitcoin. It has one purpose and no one is using it for such.

SV is just being pumped. There's no reason only SV would go up yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:07:26
It's a matter of branding. People don't use BCH/SV because it's not BTC.
BTC is currently unusable for any meaningful amount of commerce and there is no sign it ever will be because the devs and users who support them are idiots.
Lightning is never going to succeed. Another coin will likely succeed first if Lightning is what people are waiting for.
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:28:18
What point are you trying to make?
Google Pay and Apple Pay are widely accepted in the US, Bitcoin isn't. I will carry my credit cards with me regardless because I also carry things like my license. They aren't accepted everywhere, but they're growing quickly. I use them whenever I can. In Europe, I use my European cards that are NFC or just mobile payments if they accept them.
I also have things like Paypal on my phone, banking apps, I know my main CC number by heart, and I can buy pretty much everything online.
I haven't carried cash with me in years in the US. In Europe I carry cash often.

Yet no one is doing it. Wonder why...
No one wants off-chain scaling for a coin that can already accommodate demand with on-chain scaling.
Give me 32MB blocks before Lightning, please. I live in 2018, not 1998.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:26:12
Of course. You will need a pretty large receiver currently. You won't be able to just see a wifi network on your phone to connect to.
I believe the current receiver for these is about the size of a large pizza box. In other words, you're not going to carry one with you.

Start at some value near $0 for the private stock, and take it to 10 years out.
How much did Google stock cost when they were in their garage without any investment? Probably next to nothing. You could have invested in Google pre-IPO if you knew them.

It's widely accepted that spectrum belongs to the state. You cannot operate telecommunication equipment across another country without their consent. Spectrum is more or less a natural resource. This is why you couldn't set up a tower on the border of Canada and broadcast into the US without US permission.
If you decided to broadcast uncensored wireless internet into China, you would be breaking the law in China and "stealing" from the Chinese state. They would likely be very well within their right to stop you. Now China isn't going to shoot down your cell tower any more than a company is going to try and set one up in the first place. And if a company tried, the authorities would likely step in long before China had to do anything.
You'd lose in court long before China would shoot your stuff down, but in the event you didn't, they definitely would take you out by force.
