Without any major change in infrastructure or code, frankly this is just manifestation of people moving away from bitcoin as the hype dies down. $20-60 tx fees are simply retarded, I might as well FedEx a briefcase full of cash... Bitcoin is just a bit of software with a specific use, another coin(s) will take the baton as this network is basically unusable.
Old school bitcoiner here, wake up and smell the roses guys before you get left holding the bags...

But if not many people use LN, it decreases it's utility dramatically. I can use bitcoin on chain, but it costs $20-60.

Why exactly can't we trust coinbase?

Surely if gold/silver are stagnant when they shouldn't be, it's the perfect buy signal?

Why would you buy something that has no fundamental use apart from selling to someone else who considers it equal or higher value than you, for precisely the same reasons that you had for buying it in the first place?
Comparing bitcoin to a derivative is just naïve as ultimately, it's just a number on a distributed database.
The circle jerk is real.

But gold is very useful...

Money's inherent value is that people will accept it widely for goods and services. Talking about bitcoin as an "asset" which doesn't need to be widely used as a medium for exchange kind of logically defeats itself.
New money is ultimately a number on a database which is widely accepted and trusted. If bitcoin isn't accepted anywhere, for a number of obvious reasons (slow transfer, high volatility, large transaction fees) then it's value is ultimately worthless. It's the digital equivalent of a Pokémon card in a way.
To further compound my point, if you bought at 18k, you've lost over 50% of your value in the last 6 months. Gold is a physical, rare and inherently useful thing. 
Keep telling yourself that your bitcoin will be worth millions one day, just ask yourself why anyone would actually spend a million on a bitcoin as opposed to - I don't know - a really nice house?
I don't disagree with cryptocurrency and I think it's a really interesting area, but the day I had to spend $40 to transfer my bitcoin was the day the veil was lifted.

It's a bit different when the actor doing the stealing is a well organized war machine compared to some kid in a basement who's pretty good with a computer.

Revolut is an online bank (or service, not sure how it's designed) which allows you to spend money in whatever currency you please. Usually the rate of exchange is pretty close to the market rate. There's a bunch of other features it offers but that's the main one I know of.

A pretty quick Google search shows that the rights to mine aren't restricted and are open to anyone... Lying doesn't make bitcoin any more attractive

Aah OK, this is great information, thanks!

So as far as I understand it, segwit activation is coming in august, however I'm learning now that it's actually a soft fork... A hard fork would then come after a certain period right?
