Yep, Chase cancelled mine several times in November (first from my debit card, the next couple of times from bank transfers), so I ended up using one of my Ally accounts. 
The worst part was the Chase transfer was $100 for 0.013, which is around $220 now!

Is Spar seen the same way in SA as it is in the UK?

My dad must be a little younger than yours. He retired on ill health from the police a few months ago and got a decent lump payment from his pension. He asked me help him invest £1,000 today. Then he said “fuck it” and did £5,000 instead. He doesn’t totally understand it but has a decent idea. I also kept hammering that he shouldn’t put more than he can afford to lose. Maybe he has more he can afford to lose than I first thought!

To a wallet or to a bank account?

Wow. So they’re literally recycling plots from Chicago Med. At least it sounds like they made the IT department sound a little bit competent. Despite that bullshit “I don’t understand what you just said just tell me how to stop it”.  When I go see my doctor, I’ll let them explain a situation to me without saying that shit.   
In Chicago Med they made it seem like their IT department was just some geeky guy and nobody else. Then the rich, Jewish, Black heart surgeon with Aspergers saved the day by paying the fee.

Eh, I regret all the pizza I buy with fiat too. :(

This is great to hear. Oh, and Spencer doesn't exist.

Yeah, because cocaine addictions really hurt finance.

That motherfucker better keep his mouth shut while cutting my hair then!

Of course! It makes it much easier to wildly gesticulate.

Ugh. What is it with FIAT and these shitcoins? Deutschmark, Euro, Dollar?!
