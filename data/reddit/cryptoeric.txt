BTC clicked as an investment vehicle to me in 2015. I essentially realized supply is so limited, even if demand lied flat (which it won't), it will go up. But I didn't fully understand the capacity of blockchain until early 2016, when I began researching Ethereum, trying to understand it. Once it really clicked, I understood how this will change the world. Still feel the same. Never sold. Won't until 50k+ BTC
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:32:16
oh there are plenty of us my fren. I've seen it all, nothing will make me sell below 50k.
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:58:28


This is not a fair comparison. Even trying to accurately quantify the medallion decrease percent in utility in relation to percent of drop in price is a little bit of a stretch. How correlated are those really. While I agree if BTC had more utility, as it should, it would grow at a much greater rate as the network of users expands. Unfortunately BTC has not and will not chose this route, or so I believe. You hold BTC so it may be safe to assume you also believe BTC will go significantly higher in the future. BTC has distanced itself from its utility as peer-to-peer cash. It is the new gold and a brand name. That is all. BUT, that's all it will need for long(ish) term success.

Except it will not be worthless for a very long time, if ever. This is a non threat for at least a decade. I've held through the 2013 bubble and now the 2017 and still haven't sold. Unlike most, I actually have 100% trust in BTC

PoW is actually the safest and most secure way to secure the network. Scaling BTC is irrelevant at this point, and we learned that years ago now. It's not a currency, it's just digital gold. Custody services will be built all around BTC as infrastructure. Turns out the general population does NOT want to be their own bank. BTC being slow is just a speed bump that won't effect it's long term trajectory as much as you'd like to think. 
Hal Finney said this about BTC scaling (whom is very likely to potentially have been Satoshi himself)
In 2010, digital cash pioneer Hal Finney famously [made the case]( for what could be called the institutional approach to scaling Bitcoin.


In a brilliant stroke of foresight, Hal understood that base layer Bitcoin would never scale to the desired level in its current format. (Unfortunately, many Bitcoin evangelists failed to understand this, and their misapprehensions led to the bitter blocksize wars of 2015–17.) In Hal’s view, Bitcoin would be a high-powered money mediating large settlements between financial institutions, rather than a payment token used for the online equivalent of petty cash payments. He realized that Bitcoin’s rather slow settlement times (compared to physical cash or credit cards) combined with the inefficiency of the chain itself meant that directing Bitcoin to the brick-and-mortar payments use case was a square peg in a round hole.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:20:50
To me, it seems you are misled. If true decentralization, privacy, and not-being-regulated are your concerns, you should look into projects like Monero, Zcash, Dash, Verge, etc 
Bitcoin will undoubtedly be regulated. I bet you'd find the majority of BTC supporters are fine/happy with financial regulation, as long as it's not made illegal in some fashion. BTC is not centered around privacy and lack of regulation. Also hashpower is becoming significantly more centralized overtime
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:45
Yeah because who the hell wants a Bitcoin where fees are low and transaction speeds are quick

Better question: How did the US dollar obtain value? Oh yeah, it has none. Yet it does... because  of consensus -- we all agree a dollar is worth a dollar. The same logic is applied to BTC. Consensus. Scarcity. Demand. Decentralization. Security.
@_date: 2019-11-15 07:10:23
No the government does not regulate the dollar whatsoever. The federal reserve does that, which is a private entity. All they do is decide how much to print each month. The dollar is backed by nothing, it was taken off the gold standard by Nixon in the 80s. It has no intrinsic value, it is just a number on a computer screen
@_date: 2019-11-19 02:03:46
I stacked most my BTC under 1k per bit in 2016. Still here, haven't sold shit. I feel ya. Patience my friend.
@_date: 2019-08-04 04:42:28
Yes it's unfortunate BTC decided to NOT scale. I agree with most of what you said. Regardless, I think it's irrelevant now. BTC will continue to be successful as a store of value, hedge against the traditional economy, and a means of transferring wealth. So in short, yes, only the rich will use it in the future for actual transactions, but these things alone I believe are more than enough to make it successful (not as a currency)

This is completely normal. Bitcoin is very slow unfortunately. No need to worry about it though, it will come.
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:10:45
Every 10 minutes is slow. And nobody wants to pay a $10 fee to move $100 worth of BTC
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:19:58
Bitcoin has only become less and less decentralized. Also, how did BTC scale, lol? You mean segwit? Yeah, because that 20-30% boost to block space due to segwit helped sooo much. Nobody uses LN because it's a bad product made by a for profit company

I'm also curious what you think of what Hal Finney said about BTC scaling (whom is very likely to potentially have been Satoshi himself I'm sure you're aware if you've been around since 2013)
 
In 2010, digital cash pioneer Hal Finney famously [made the case]( for what could be called the institutional approach to scaling Bitcoin.


*Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.*
In a brilliant stroke of foresight, Hal understood that base layer Bitcoin would never scale to the desired level in its current format. (Unfortunately, many Bitcoin evangelists failed to understand this, and their misapprehensions led to the bitter blocksize wars of 2015–17.) In Hal’s view, Bitcoin would be a high-powered money mediating large settlements between financial institutions, rather than a payment token used for the online equivalent of petty cash payments. He realized that Bitcoin’s rather slow settlement times (compared to physical cash or credit cards) combined with the inefficiency of the chain itself meant that directing Bitcoin to the brick-and-mortar payments use case was a square peg in a round hole.
What Hal envisioned was a system where banks could be auditable, transparent in their capital ratios, and accountable. A free market for reserve/capital ratios could even develop, as depositors would be able to select banks with varying levels of reserves to suit their risk preference.
Under capitalized banks might fail — but this would be a healthy market signal, a culling of weaker entities to render the herd stronger overall. Compare this to the system that became unraveled in 2008/09: financial institutions heaping on leverage, knowing that they would be bailed out if something went wrong. Since the government made it clear that it would not allow banks to fail, the market was robbed of that valuable feedback mechanism and risk became increasingly abstracted, obscure, and hidden.
In the words of [Elaine Ou](


In finance, risk never truly disappears, even if hidden — and suppressing it often has the nasty effect of unleashing it in a more dramatic fashion later on.
Just as risk crept up on us, unheralded, and financial institutions failed one after the next in a cascade of toxic balance sheets in 2009, so too will the long-suppressed forces of systemic risk unleash themselves when our present monetary experiment finally unwinds.
Can Bitcoin mollify this? Perhaps not. But its very structure facilitates the creation of an alternative financial system which is far more transparent and open about risk than the present one. This is the Finney view of Bitcoin: Bitcoin as a virtual commodity sitting in provable reserves in financial institutions. No one’s liability, a provable virtual commodity which a bank can rely on to attest to its viability.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:28:51
Lol reading your posts is like talking to myself in the mirror. Glad I'm not alone at least..... in early 2017 I used to say BTC couldn't go past 12k due to congestion issues, yet it did. Honestly, I expect BTC to hit or pass 40-50k within the next 18 months. Quite frankly I don't think the market gives a shit (up until a point...)
Until BTC essentially becomes illiquid due to extreme congestion, I don't see it's lack of utility hurting it's price climb this time around. Now with that being said, I do not believe BTC will EVER break 100k without first resolving its scaling issues (which is still looking unlikely unfortunately) Hence we carry lot of BCH bags as well. However the market is extremely irrational and who the knows what'll really happen, so we have all bases covered haha
In a perfect world BTC would just wake the fuck up and up it's blocksize. What's happened to the community is really unfortunate as I don't see that happening
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:38:52
Somewhat similar to politics. People have different opinions on how BTCs protocol should solve the scaling issue. Each fork is just a different approach to solve scaling. This is survivor island basically and in due time some will fail miserably while others will be incredibly successful

@_date: 2017-11-03 18:24:42
75% crash? What a joke. This only occured sub 1k BTC. Bitcoin will never crash below 25% of whatever current ATH again. Bitcoin becomes far more stable as the market capitalization grows. Poor understanding of economics. Yes, BTC will crash, but to about 4.9k at most

I've been laughing to the bank for the last 18 months
It's the same story with them. "900 for one?! That's absurd!"
"2000 for ONE bitcoin?! Hell no!"
"3000 is WAYY too high, I'll wait for it to go back to 1500"

The only difference between BTC and BCH is that they are taking two different routes to solve the scaling problem. Both have pros and cons. BTC uses Segwit, BCH increased block size. 
The r/btc subreddit isn't all about BCH. It's open to all posts. The reason you see a lot of BCH related things on r/btc is because here at r/bitcoin the mods censor any content that they disagree with. So you only see negative news about Bitcoin Cash on r/bitcoin. r/btc isn't censored, lol. This comment will probably be deleted and I'll be banned just for saying this

No, I live in California, and I've never done online gambling in my life, or anything sketchy online for that matter. I just trade. I've been trading cryptocurrencies for nearly 2 years now.

@_date: 2017-10-20 21:26:29
I bought at $390 and a lot of people still laugh at me too. They think I am an idiot for not selling. They're just in pure denial of Bitcoin and blockchain as a whole. I just have become used to it. Even if BTC hits 20k, the same people will be saying the same things. Fuck em. I'll be driving by their day jobs laughing in my lambo someday

@_date: 2019-09-05 04:48:50
I think that about my own thinking sometimes. But all opinions are based off of pure math/economics, analytics, and logic. It's hard to not be excited about something when seemingly every good indicator is pointing in the same direction.

@_date: 2019-09-27 00:34:59
Nobody knows what will happen in the short term. My best guess is we consolidate between 5-10k for awhile before launching off sometime around the halving

@_date: 2017-10-20 22:46:41
Definitely buy one. It's a matter of how you want to buy. You can either buy now, or dollar cost average. (google if don't know what that is)
I'd just buy it and hold it. Seriously, HOLD. There's a reason everyone says it as a joke... because it's one of the best strategies for BTC. 
Limited supply, demand sky rocketing, what do you expect? I tell people buy and hold until at least 2121. Because that's when the next halving in supply occurs. BTC will undoubtedly be over 20k by then. My twitter for more info: twitter.com/Crypto_Eric

Yup. Many people who know I made my entire net worth off of BTC and crypto in general think it is entirely undeserved and I was purely "lucky" when i was dumping my savings in at 200-300/btc. Like come on. People don't understand the amount of risk we had to take, and go against the grain and be laughed at and ridiculed as 'investors' up until it made us rich. I remember people telling me I was an idiot for not selling when it broke back through 1k. Fuck em though, they're saving for years at best shoving money into a crappy 401k while we're laughing at the ₿ank
@_date: 2019-09-04 07:45:17
Yes but how is Bitcoin ever expected to scale, that's going to keep happening or worse as Bitcoin continues to grow. Nobody uses LN and its a bad product. BTC has to figure something out. I expect it to be successful either way though, this would expedite the process...

I agree BTC stability is more important. Larger blocks are the easiest known solution, but yes it may hurt decentralization which isn't good. I don't believe in LN either, though (yet). I am still betting big on BTC though because I believe there will be more infrastructure built around BTC in the future, ones significantly better than LN
