Not me.
I think if that people looking for security statistically outnumber the amount of people looking for anonymity.
Therefore, Bitcoin adoption (i.e. price) has more chance to rise if it's seen as something safe rather than something anonymous.
Nevertheless, the anonymity will still stay and therefore it's really a win win situation IMHO
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:12:33
That may be a very interesting point to explore.
Your help is certainly appreciated!
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:01:59
Yeah I'm on Bitstamp and I'm experiencing that problem.
I'm kind of new to the whole bitcoin trading scene but do you think that these problems could be explaining why the bitcoin is in a downward slope atm?
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:29:02
I'm expecting it to drop to about $200 before buying more
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:21:23
I think I heard that Thailand has outlawed the use of Bitcoins for Thailand
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:26:45
I think that in a little over one month of time, bitcoin being the volatile currency it is atm, we can expect a drop or two.
However, I believe the recoveries will be, as it was with previous ones, just a matter of days. Therefore, I think that predicting it at a stable +- 1.5k$ isn't too crazy.
Just my opinion, I'm not a fortune teller with a crystal ball
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:04:27
Alt coins are real bubbles. 
100% speculation, no good news concerning their introduction in any country's economy. Therefore their rise is purely explained by the rise of the bitcoin. 
People investing in them are really just seeing a POTENTIAL acceptance of those coins after Bitcoins get fully approved.
If you want to be a super speculator, go invest in them...

Feeling like Captain Obvious here but apparently not everyone seems to get this as easily as it should be...
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:17:33
Well actually it's Finance. But I guess you could classify that as Economics
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:43:45
Thank you !
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:50:30
Is it possible to make several deposits or do you need to be waiting for the 1st one to be complete before sending a new deposit?
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:00:30
Just hover with your pointer over it. It will be much more clearer ;)
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:42:44
I'm talking about a long run perspective. Not day trading.
There are enough panic sellers on the bitcoin market as it is...
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:38:26
You call that a crash? Lol it didn't even lose 20%...
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:32:37
Panic sellers guys... It barely even lost 10%... 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:17:33
Panic sellers always sell at round numbers. This is clearly visible on Bitstamp where we ended just shy of 800$ before dropping back to 790$
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:39:06
Limit orders
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:44:25
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:22:23
Based on what? Your crystal ball's prediction?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:19:54
notice the 25m lag
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:03:46
The doctor just managed to reanimate Mt Gox !
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:00:37
It's not just your IP. They're facing DDOS problems. I have the same thing here
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:20:15
Plus500 also allows you to go short on Bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:07:00
Bitcoin has been extremely volatile the whole week. Ppl who bought at 900 and cried about their mistake are actually relieved today seeing that they might be able to break even in the near future.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:22:21
How do you back this up?
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:25:04
Interesting. I expect there to be a stabilzation after it starts being used as a currency in our every-day economy. Otherwise there is really no use in the economy at all for such a highly rising asset in terms of transaction as nobody would be spending their bitcoins, they would rather hold on to it instead
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:55:15
I think that there will be a correction once we've passed 1000$. Hell, 1000$ will even be difficult to pass because of all the panic sellers wanting to get out at a round number...
If you were awake when we've hit 800$ mark, you could have clearly seen that is was quite a challenge. It got stuck on 799 2 times before actually hitting and exceeding the 800$ cap
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:00:13
It went from a 20% daily growth to a 10% daily growth. It's nothing scary.
Imho, the real correction will come once we'll see all of this $1000 bitcoin press release money coming in. It will go up a lot, and then a serious correction
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:07:18
Yeah well that was a lie I wouldn't give you a fucking nickle even if you were fucking starving in front of my eyes :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:45:13
Thank you !
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:05:31
I am expecting it to drop a little longer and then see a huge rise when the problems will be over.
Personally I believe in bitcoin as a long term investment that can yield great short term results as well.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm happy with this fall and I'm waiting a little bit longer before buying more
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:54:56
Woohoo we made it tonight! I honestly was starting to lose hope
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:50:47
I would have given you more than 0.000177 BTC, actually, I would have given you a whole BTC because studying is important.
But I hate beggers. So sorry Charly no sale
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:50:50
Or you could just go short on dollars the amount you invested in. That way you cancel the exchange rate risk
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:01:11
You're the one who said it would be in one hour ;). 
Just admit you're wrong, every one can be once in a while
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:47:29
I wasn't here before October. I'm sad to see I made an unintentional kind of repost...
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:33:06
Just check the values where a lot of bitcoins are bid/asked. It's allways on round number. Even for decades...
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:05:13
Ugh... I already found Bitstamp's verification anoying as a student living at home with his parents and having almost no recent bills confirming my residence...
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:28:38
I posted it there as well, I posted it here for more answers
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:56:33
Some people really need to understand volatility...
Honestly, I wouldn't even be surprise that this was just a huge pump by someone with a lot of money. If it was, that man has just got a LOT of cheaper bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:44:44
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:01:02
Could you argument your point of view?
Nobody has a crystal ball to predict the future. You can be right 100 times and wrong one time and so without any arguments this statement is pretty worthless
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:48:13
You diserve to be hit by a caddle prod if you think that...
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:46:26
Hmmm interesting. Thanks for your time and advice!
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:53:54
The longer you wait the less you'll get and the more regret you'll have
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:36:32
But how do you predict the peak? That is the hard part about it!
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:44:29
So it gained $40 over the night. Tell me again what was that you said about a 10$ loss and always being right on bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:10:48
They email you
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:22:42
I've actually already made the transfer to them so yeah...
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:35:53
Don't be greedy, buy back now, considering the future rise it's still a nice win
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:31:14
I hope not... I made the mistake of buying at 790$ today...
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:40:18
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:38:52
And how much did it gain before? You're still looking in green on daily average...
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:48:04
Maybe. Personnally I had a Bitstamp verification 4 days ago, went pretty quickly I must say
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:05:39
Then why make a post in the first place? This doesn't makes sense to me...
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:47:41
Nice approach, I will bear it in mind :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:27:08
All aboard the money train! choo choo!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:36:55
Btc-e took a bad hit as well but still no reason to panic. Daily growth is still almost double digit...
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:51:22
Ouch that has GOT to hurt! =\
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:14:29
I sent money yesterday, my account got credited today :)
I live in Belgium I don't know where you live
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:45:47
Thank you !
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:33:19
But how long does it takes for you to transfer bitcoins from Multibit to Bitstamp?
Let's say I see a crash and I want to play risky and sell my bitcoins to buy them off cheaper, if my money isn't stored on bitstamp, isn't there a risk that by the time it gets back there the crash has reached his floor ?
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:38:25
Why would someone write an article when they know so little about a subject?
I mean I know nothing about nuclear physics and would therefore never write an article about it.
But really voicing concerns over the 21 million amount being possibly raised is just taking the retard train all the way to the terminus...
He just lost all credibility there
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:40:14
Are their verifications stuck? Or do you just mean new members just subscribing?
