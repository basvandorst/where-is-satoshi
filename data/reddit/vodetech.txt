He was our saviour. He bought the pizza for our sins. So the price could ascend.

“I risked everything,” he said.
I'm sure this same thing was said by many who bought in last year as well.

You forgot some important people getting their bonuses and stuff. Or was that the other way around? Can't even keep track anymore.
@_date: 2019-03-20 07:01:54
This is definitely good for Bitcoin.

I wish we could say the same here in Finland, but we have this thing called "Tax Bear" that takes a portion of our money if we use it in any form. So better just let it sit.
Damn bears..

Essentially we are all gambling?

Have to balance the risk of missing the train with the risk of crashing with the train.
@_date: 2019-02-25 11:40:07
This is fascinating! I love it!

So are the rewards. But It's better to be safe than sorry.

Thug A: "Hey look! It's Bitcoin atm!"
Thug B: "How about we break into it and fill our pockets with some Bitcoins?"
Thus A: "Yes, let's do that! Let's do that now! We are going to be rich!"

Embrace the Chinese new year!

Exactly same things were said when bitcoin dropped to 6k..

If you buy, just buy some. Never blow a full amount in. Nothing is more frustrating than putting all your capital in and then after few days against all odds it goes negative and you have to wait for god knows how long (if ever) to get even.
@_date: 2018-11-28 08:44:27
This. Exactly this. Not every 18 year old is the same, but life is still confusing as hell at that time. It's easy to make mistakes.
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:37:11
Well, at least they can say they got strong arms? :-D
@_date: 2018-11-27 09:30:30
Thank you, this was exactly what I was looking for.

Dog market or frog market?
@_date: 2018-11-27 09:14:10
Then just draw a new line.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:57:03
Doge is and has always been the most stable crypto because 1 Doge always equals 1 Doge. Should be common knowledge by now.

Welcome to crypto. Learning by doing is often best way, but in crypto and all finances there is financial risk involved. Do your best to minimize that risk. Play around, but play with small amounts. Make a habit of double checking everything before you take action. Never listen to random financial advice on the internet and always do your own research. Learn to identify your own "FOMO" feelings and do not act on them, but act on your rational thoughts and research you have made. This sounds like a lot, but it's something I wish I heard when I started with this stuff.

Totally normal. When you spend the whole winter in darkness, when you finally see a little bit of sunlight, it feels very refreshing.

I love the "Always hodl never sell!!" posts. If one wants to hodl forever and never sell, may as well lose your keys :D
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:38:58
And wall street bonuses!
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:54:39
Is this the institutional money people have been talking about?
@_date: 2018-12-07 08:14:40
They will, because human greed and FOMO is not to be underestimated. It may not happen anytime soon, because people are still hurt, but when the momentum changes, herd mentality will follow and greed will override critical thinking once again. Herd buys when others buy, and the herd sells when others sell.

It's because d-bags love to pump and dump.
