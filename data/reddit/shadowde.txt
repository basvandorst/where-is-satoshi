that makes zero sense if it becomes worthless. then you just lost twice the money you were initially willing to lose
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:28:00
in case some people don't get it, it's ironic that he says bitcoins are worthless when they're using monopoly money
@_date: 2015-05-11 07:06:31


It's the bitcoin blockchain

Thanks, sent her an email

It must be a bug because I also have the same issue with a purchase I made before reaching level 2.
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:00:19
For what situations would the difference between 2 minutes and 10 minutes be significant? You still won't have "instant" confirmations, and you would need more confirmations for the same amount of security.

Investing in bitcoin startups helps the overall economy more than just buying bitcoins

it wasn't "abandoned" it was handed off to gavin andresen
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:18:36
how would one go about applying for a moderator position?
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:47:23
...or just more than one wallet

For the ASICMINER-PT shares you get one free transfer per month.

You receive a weekly dividend by owning shares. You can't "buy" a dividend.
@_date: 2013-12-27 09:54:55
how did you resolve the issue? Did you talk to the vendor, bitpay, or coinbase?
@_date: 2013-09-11 02:14:08
good thing BFL is u.s. based.....
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:19:19
It's not so much about decreasing security as it is causing instability in the blockchain
@_date: 2013-07-20 20:14:44
I have the  same problem. The funds were withdrawn from my account on July 9th and I was supposed to get my coins July 12th. It's July 20th now and the transaction disappeared from my account and I have not been refunded my money...I'm currently trying to work with customer support but they haven't responded for a few days now...
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:17:31
human population: 7.133 billion = 7.133 billion butts
7.133 billion / 21 million = 340 butts
So, 1 Bitcoin = 340 butts

As long as it's used for public keys there's no risk
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:10:32
yeah, but currently people are still technically mining on their own and can switch pools if the pool owner is known to be nefarious. I'm wondering if in the future when it's not economical for anybody to mine themselves and only large corporations are mining bitcoins, i.e. asicminer or something
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:37:42
if they get the private key then they have the coins. no way around that
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:45:25
heh looks like a dead cat bounce at the end
@_date: 2013-05-16 11:58:05


It's more like giving them the password to your bank account and trusting the cashier to never log into it
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:33:38
@_date: 2013-07-23 05:50:19
I have the exact same issue. Except now the transaction has disappeared from my account and I still have no bitcoins to show for it.
@_date: 2013-07-28 18:01:58
my similar issue was resolved as well :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:12:15
what if the government tells them to not put transactions from a certain address or addresses linked to it into a block because it's known to be from a drug dealer etc. ? Assuming we get to the point where very few big players are controlling a large portion of the network
@_date: 2013-05-31 01:21:35
I'm surprised there isn't a "Bitcoin for Dummies" book yet haha
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:09:26
then they should say that
@_date: 2013-11-09 12:13:02
only a matter of time
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:25:08
this happened to me once when i cancelled the transaction halfway, it didn't let me buy it again
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:07:08
you make the public private key pair first, then generate the qr code for only the public key so people can send you money
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:17:16
As someone who has been around since early 2011, I have concluded that watching graphs is fun
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:07:53
this had nothing to do with confirmation times. it was coinbase not broadcasting the transaction to the network at all. it would've gone through with 0-confirmations.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:14:09
easiest: 
@_date: 2013-07-21 06:31:18
right..why are we worrying about pegging bitcoin to the dollar again?
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:24:35
Hm, you're right that's true
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:08:18
A good amount would be one that doesn't affect your financial security in case the worst happens
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:18:19
except you give google consent to do so
@_date: 2013-09-27 08:10:55
Have you tried reverting to an older version of multibit?
@_date: 2013-08-03 02:48:00
This is why you use escrow
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:14:37
you could use a fishtank
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:12:35
...so pay your taxes
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:24:45
mtgox is not chinese. mtgox is based in japan
@_date: 2013-09-27 07:29:20
Did you make backups of your wallets?
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:08:24
guess they don't need the money
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:49:50
I tried to use bitfunder but the requirement to have another account on WeExchange was a turn off. I'd recommend checking out another popular exchange btct.co.
If you want to see information about a stock, for example ASICMINER-PT, visit  just click the "detail" tab.
I'm not too much of an expert on the subject so if others could chime in that'd be helpful.
As always, never invest what you can't afford to lose.

Hopefully merchants will realize that accepting both bitcoin and litecoin is not beneficial for them in the long run

Is that a software authenticator named as "No software authenticator linked.fgfgh" ?
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:21:46
You're about 2 years too late. Unless you have free electricity, you likely won't see much of a profit now. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 05:35:00
you'd be walking with a target on your back if you had any sort of wealth
