The two issues are a) trust that YOU won't be stolen from and b) whether they are evading tax.
It is immoral to evade tax and illegal too
Your call though!

Yeah i realise i risk the banhammer for that. I think there's a 0.5% chance of zero, but maybe a 7% chance of back down to $1k or so

Quantitative easing about to happen in the eurozone, in context of currency war between the other superpowers. Plus the pound tanking. Economies are shrinking and QE doesn't work so a lot of movement out of fiat and not necessarily into stocks should benefit btc holders.
Prophecies are bs but 16k is definitely in with a shout. But, if it does hit 16k in that short a time, i'm pretty sure the momentum and world factors would allow it to keep going.

I think minimum 40% return is about 80% likely.
But if there's a 10% chance you lose it, do you want to pay 11k for the privilege?
It's not a bad bet while interest rates are low, but would you bet that on sport? Unlikely. I agree with the previous comment.

I don't think it's really compatible with socialism since we tend to believe the state is the means through which the people should oversee the economy. Central banks would be a necessity I think - and evading tax is an anti-social act. However, in the current situation where (eg) the UK and US central banks are NOT part of the state, a citizen can morally opt out of participation on this basis: making BTC fair game.
This is how I validate my own use anyway!

You're an angry man eh?
I think i made it pretty clear they were very rough estimates. What are you working from? If you're sitting with charts you think predict the future, then who's more deluded?

You won't find anything crypto specific  - just as you won't for the sale of artworks or other such things

Advice: don't be daft man

My understanding was, only when you cash it out in £ - and it needs to be over the threshold of (i think) 12 grand - but llease check that on the .gov site

Because who tf would be interested in a song about bitcoin?

Bittrex has been good in my experience since they unf*cked their customer service.

Seems a bit daft to try to make assumptions without envronmental factors.  Trade wars and stimulus/printing are going to hit currencies over the coming months and people are getting more and more likely to include btc as a store of value even in a basket of options. Relatively speaking, btc is quite scarce and the price is more susceptible to self-perpetuating swings whenever this behaviour happens. I'm not a btc cheerleader, it is what it is, and in fact i sold most of my holdings due to personal circs recently. But i think we'll see 60k in the next 9 months.
