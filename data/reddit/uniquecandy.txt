Oh I've got all the seeds but the few relatives I have would never be able work out how to claim it. I brought my bitcoin 4 years ago and then eth 2 years ago and only I know about it. I've told no one. Sometimes I wonder about somehow getting it included in a will along with instructions for the solicitor to get it all claimed for my family. The rest of my family are completely non technical and my daughter has a learning disability. Has anyone got any ideas because this is something I worry about sometimes.

Personally I hold back from changing over to segwit on my Trezors because I know there are forked coins I will be able to claim on my legacy wallet, I already claimed BCH and BCG I anticipate there may be more like B2X soon if I change over now will I be able to claim using the coin splitting tools Trezor provides for forked coins. Any advice.

Even though I've lost much over the last month I still found this hilarious.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:20:15
Worst case 5000 in the next 5 to 6 months, as it will start to go down in line with December 2013 peak. But unlike that occasion the new developments, segwit adoption, lower fees and transaction times, Lightning network and Schor will put the brakes on and reverse the downward trend. So low of 5000 moving back to 20000 in time for bitcoins 10th birthday. Then a massive amount of positive news around that time will make it fly at the start of 2019.

To be honest I wish China an S.Korea would just ban mining and exchanges all together then and fuck off, it will be their loss in the long run. Then mining and exchanges can redistribute and become less centralized.

I used electrum for years before getting trezors I never had any issues and loved the simple no fuss GUI. I think the developers are on the ball also as it was the first wallet to go with segwit. Also electrum can be used alongside trezor so I can highly recommend.

If he thinks that about a 1% rise in interest rates is going to tempt people to stay in fiat he is delusional. Bitcoin is rapidly improving and now it is definitely on every investors radar, the only way is up over the year. $30k is my conservative estimate.

Debt at 22.5trn, deficit at 1trn and rising, they shrug their shoulders, laugh and state they will just print endlessly and with impunity. Ignorance or arrogance?

Further, even in times when even distribution has been tried it hasn't lasted long before the majority of wealth went to the minority.

Now I agree generally it shouldn't be discussed, but the way some on here pull up other posters that mention it you'd think they where holding something akin to toxic waste. Specifically, what is it about Bitcoin that makes it more risky? Why doesn't any other wealthy individual have to worry about this too. And if never admitting your wealth equals never spending your wealth equals never actually enjoying it then what's the point?

On the back of a napkin conservatively, 250,000 vans in the world, consuming 20 litres of fuel per day, 36MJ of energy per litre, so doing the maths 2GW to run all the security vans in the world so about 6 times more than bitcoin, and that is just the vans. Also bitcoins energy is not expected to rise in line with price, in fact it will plateau at some point, and the mines can be positioned in the best places to make use of renewable energy in future.

Agree totally, but for example all those lottery winners that have their pictures taken with a bottle of champagne and all their details in the put in the press, seriously I think they are idiots, but what is it that makes it OK for them to flaunt their new wealth, what is the actual difference? I know you might say that Bitcoin has no recourse but what stops someone kidnapping the lottery winners daughter and demanding millions in Bitcoin from them? Since it's only one extra step for them to buy the Bitcoin.
A good example of context is for example, last year when the price was in freefall anyone posting that they didn't sell was branded an idiot, but maybe the reason they didn't sell is because they had a large holding and didn't know how to without incurring large tax bill, KYC/AML problems and bank accounts being frozen. 
No I certainly will not disclose my holding, if indeed I have any holding at all! I just wonder why anybody even with small holdings get instantly shot down and what this means for Bitcoin hodlers in the broader sense.
@_date: 2019-07-07 10:24:48

Tactful response.
The report is probably biased and woefully inaccurate. Bitcoin uses over 75% renewable energy and rising, isn't this great for renewable energy development. There isn't necessarily a correlation between mass adoption and energy usage.
Tactless response.
Tough, we the people of earth will need Bitcoin far more than the ignorant editors of these articles currently know, it can't/won't be stopped no matter how much these people bleat on about it's energy usage and... ULTIMATELY BITCOIN DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK ANYWAY.

@_date: 2018-09-02 08:24:53
Because Bitcoins decentralization is perfect (we can't even find it's creator!), and it's proof of work that created the ledger is so monumental, it's impossible to imagine another coin that can be a lot better. And that's the point another coin would need to be a LOT better to overcome the network effect of Bitcoin. So far 1800 coins have tried and none come close really. Myspace was originally designed for brands to promote themselves and become a social network site by accident, but it ended up messy and a faf to use. Facebook was designed to be a social networking site from the ground up, and so it was a LOT better and was therefore able to overcome Myspace's larger network effect.

Most people have the mentality of sheep that's why we had the ridiculous bubble at the end of last year. But as individuals the best we can do is to make a point of spending at retailers that accept Bitcoin and of course replacing what you spend.  Also don't advise people to just buy Bitcoin, instead tell them to learn about it and  make up their own mind.

Briefly, because I don't want to spend too much time here.
Even without it being a good payments medium it still has even more scarcity and much more utility than gold which has a cap of over 7 trillion, so that is a good prize for a start, becoming a major payments system will take much longer agreed.
And this prize will come about due to the effect of a simple, but slow technological adoption curve, just like the telephone, radio, tv, internet etc. I agree that the value got silly crazy towards the end of last year, but you really do need to zoom right on an exponential chart, and use a lot of imagination to iron out those peaks and troughs to see this.

This means that the country has declined to a level of anarchy by then, first point in this case is every body, not only crypto holders are in serious shit, second all anarchies have corrupt law enforcers (and guess what they will take bribes in), thirdly for all the reasons above, the absurdity of governments being able to prove someone as possessing crypto.
@_date: 2018-08-15 11:31:47

Bitcoin is not a company, has no CEO, has no location, no brand and no registered trademark. Hence there's nothing to stop this sort of thing from happening. I would love for the organisers to chat on here so I can ask them WTF. Really this event is just anti bitcoin IMHO, not accepting Bitcoin proves this.

New tech needs to be MUCH better to overcome a strong network effect, what can you think of that is, or could be any way near better than Bitcoin? 
Store of value IS a great use case, gold hits 7trillion being just that. Who spends their physical gold?
Besides unless you've been under a rock the last two years you know full well the payments use case is being successfully developed via lightning.
If increase in price goes hand in hand with increase of adoption then yes I do care.
@_date: 2019-03-27 14:43:57
All very true and highly recommended. But here's a thought. IF Coinbase goes down big time then the value of your privately owned Bitcoin is going to tank at least half it's value. Just thought I'd say in case any private key holders, myself included feel smug about such an event happening. The contagion will spread in such an event, so you better hope that Coinbase survives regardless of if you have your coins on the exchange or not.

You can't be blamed for thinking this as it is impossible for anyone to get their head around the number of private key combinations which is 1.158 x 10^77. But briefly that figure is comparable to the number of atoms in the observable universe estimated at 7.1 x 10^79 so only about 600 times more atoms in the observable universe. All I can say is it is fantastically unlikely to happen in any foreseeable future, plus if there was ever a chance this number could be increased by hard forking to new code.
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:30:29
Disagree, people who have only $1000 in savings don't have Bitcoin. 
The economy is so fragile that a recession will trigger quantitive easing and inflation on a massive scale. People with savings will be looking for the exit, and Bitcoin, like gold will be seen as a safe haven.

Agree, well said.
Always conveniently measuring from ATH and using the worse overall cryptocurrency data as ammo, but targeting Bitcoin with it.
 
Missing the fact that their own chart clearly shows significant transaction growth year on year and a levelling off in decline recently,
It's a shit piece of FUD that was also displayed by another so called group of experts several weeks ago. I was unimpressed then, and still am now.

Well your post is obviously the same crap we have all heard from ignorant people like you for years now, you have just masqueraded it as a question. You know very well that there is huge benefit to Bitcoin or else you are sillier than I think. 
I'll make a confession the example is not one of mine, but from Andreas Antonopolous himself, so not someone who is known for his poor analogy (your in a minority here).
Just making the point that 120 years ago someone like you would have doubtless made such comments, thus completely missing a much more important point.
Of course the Motor Car/Bitcoin is not very useful in the early days, but without builders, believers and doers where would we be now?

May happen but I believe they will only be able to do no less than 50% in reserve with Bitcoin. The reason is It's too easy for anyone to store (and maybe even easier in future) and the supply of Bitcoin now, and in future is too easy to check. Meanwhile the massive benefits in terms of adoption and normalization will be massive, far outweighing the created illusion of there being twice as much Bitcion.

Wow OP has noticed something that nobody else could see, a descending triangle! With such insightful technical analysis I would not be surprised if he isn't a billionaire already. And it really shows that my method of reading tea leaves as poor by comparison. This oracle doesn't say how low Bitcoin can go but he just uses the word CRASH. Elsewhere on this thread the word COLLAPSE has been used. And these people do this by looking at squiggly lines only, they don't even need to know anything about the fundamentals, nor care.  I'm scared, I'm shitting myself, god damit I'm going to sell now.
BYW although descending triangles can often be QUITE bearish, sometimes they can be VERY bullish too, according to other tea leaf readers.

There's nothing special about mining or having a full node anyone can do it from anywhere. OK the miners are massive players it's true, but I struggle to see what the actual concern is about this (please tell me), they are just massive slaves to the code. Then you decide to pick on PoW, which everyone else agrees, is the one feature of Bitcoin that gives it so much plausibility over any other form of currency that is just willed into exitance.
You seem to be picking on what everybody else agrees are the best features of Bitcoin and somehow twisting it, for some cause unknown.

Anybody who looks at the current situation with Bitcoin and claims it looks centralized is missing two important and glaringly obvious points.
1. The alleged centralized players are just slaves to the consensus code.
2. The system could quickly and easily become much more centralized if it needed to.
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:27:39
Think about it, how can they be means tested on their secret stash of bitcoins. So there's no need to declare it when applying for any benefits. Seriously, they will hold on to the Bitcoins like their lives depended on it. Do something new, educate yourself by reading about Gresham's law.

OK then, use a random number generator to pick ANY date and comment on that date until now, you will only rarely be able to make a very bearish comment I guarantee. Always choosing 19th December'17 spike that only lasted briefly is very unimaginative, just cherry picking a date to try to make a poor point usually.
And if us "evangelists" where to do that, cherry picking Jan'09 we could say the increase is near infinite, but we don't.

In a lot of ways real estate is very similar to crypto because there's only a finite amount of land so limited supply and building land even more limited, and some land is much more useful than other land just like bitcoin is much more useful than some other shitcoin.

True, there's a lot of thick and fickle people out there that will be happy to have an IdiotBitcoin account because they get monthly Starbucks discount vouchers, no doubt. 
But still think the fraction can't go nearly as low with Bitcoin. Ten years ago in my country ordinary people started forming a que outside Northern Rock to get their deposits, enough people lost faith then and it hit a tipping point. Then the only way to avert disaster was to appeal to the British government for a bailout, paid for by printing more money. This won't be possible with Bitcoin and the banks trying to operate any fractional reserve will find themselves constantly having to appease the more intelegent customers by buying and holding more real Bitcoin, and offering a level of service MUCH better than banking your own Bitcoin.

So in several years time you've got a large proportion of savings in "Bitcoin" via visa or any other traditional bank, and after a while it becomes clear that these banks don't even have say a half of what they claim. This is blindingly obvious because anyone can check the supply of Bitcoin and what the banks claim. Also you are aware that it's pretty easy to store Bitcoin yourself, (and probably even easier in years to come). What are you gonna do? myself I'd be thinking oh fuck I'd better pull this out before everyone else does.
Not saying that visa and all the other forms of "IdiotBitcoin" will not do SOME fractional reserve, but It won't be ANYWHERE NEAR the levels of say gold, which can't be stored by anyone easily and securely, or spent, nor can you easily work out the supply of gold now or in future.
IMHO they wouldn't go much more than 2x before people really start to question the validity of "IdiotBitcoin". It's too blindingly obvious for all to see, and when they do, a significant amount will threaten to store their Bitcoin themselves.
On the plus side, the adoption, easy of use and general normalization that these banks will bring will send the value (weather you see value in terms of growth or peoples liberty) of Bitcoin 10x, 100x, more ???
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:51:22
1 Get a Coinbase account and buy a small amount just to get started. 
2 Spend a few months learning about storage and other ways to trade in and out of Bitcoin.

Simple answer, because they have no control over supply.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:26:36
Well other than it's huge network effect, which is more significant than you think.
Bitcoin CAN be the most decentralized (note that's a slightly different statement to saying Bitcoin IS the most decentralized, OR very decentralized at the moment), I don't think any other coin competes on this, we don't even know the identity of it's creator! 
But right now Bitcoin has the highest proof of work. If you had two otherwise identical coins, with the same valuation, but you knew one took a lot of energy to create and the other took only minimal or no energy to create, which would you think is the most plausible and decide to buy?
Also don't forget the massive team of developers behind Bitcoin, so even if it has problems like scaling or speed there is a solution being developed right now.
All things considered I think another coin would have to be MUCH better to be able to topple it (like Facebook was MUCH better than myspace), at the moment I don't think anything even comes close.

Most of what you have posted is wrong or inaccurate. Therefore I'm only going to waste a few minutes of my life dismissing this eye rolling out of back of head crap, and lucky I spent that long.

The vast majority of coins are shit and will die, however, I'll let you into a secret, there is one coin out there that really breaks the mould, this is the most tested and battle hardened, the most decentralized, in fact it even seemingly has no creator, it has the most skilled developers working on it to make it scale worldwide one day, has real proof of work tokens, has limited supply, massive network effect and has been going now for nearly 10 years despite all the naysayers can throw at it. And this coin is BITCOIN. Remember you heard it here first.

Tend to agree because known events get priced in.
But the two takeaway facts for this halving are, their will definitely be lower supply from miners coming to market, this is a real happening effect.
And at less than 4% Bitcoin will finally have supply inflation lower than most fiat currencies and gold, this effect will be more psychological as Bitcoin comes of age.
I also think this halvening will be the last great halvening.

Your completely wrong, decentralization means the nodes and miners that power the network not the distribution of Bitcoin wealth.
 
Your other point is smoke and mirrors. The Bitcoin that is recognized JUST as Bitcoin by the vast majority, and despite their being over 2000 other crypto currencies still has 2/3 of crypto cap, is THE Bitcoin that will certainly have only 21 million. Even the best effort of a fork Bitcoin cash, despite all the advertising and campaigning has only achieved about 3% of Bitcoins market cap subsequent forks get less and less each time, in fact the latest so called bitcoin forks have detracted nothing. 
Of course anyone can create Bitcoin infinity but it will get completely ignored, go on try it yourself.

Do you think the USD could take another recession? It is already on its knees from the last one with nearly zero interest rates, no more room to manoeuvre. When tax revenue plunges QE will be stepped up to breaking point and supply inflation will hit badly. In this case forget about your people cashing out because of short term hardship and think of the affluent and wealthy that will far outweigh the little people and will be looking for safety from the rapidly inflating dollar. This is where a hard currency like gold and bitcoin will come into play.

Governments again, (eyes roll). Your argument poses more questions than it attempts to answer. First you need to define "governments".
When? 3 years, 5 years, or so many years that a high proportion of people on the planet are into Bitcoin by then?
To what extent would the ban be? Trading, spending? surely it can't be ownership.
Which governments, some governments, most governments, certainly not all governments? Totalitarian governments, democratic governments, certainly not governments that hold large amounts of bitcoin themselves by then?
What reasons are they going to give their voting public, a high proportion of which will own Bitcoin by then. Yes, democratic governments do have to be reasonable, are they going to say they just don't like it?
Are they going to ban gold for the same reasons? They should.
How are these governments then helping the countries which in the future have adopted Bitcoin for entirely legitimate reason, like their own fiat currency has collapsed?

Set it up with a tough passphrase and make sure you are comfortable with the recovery process. Buy it direct from Trezor and check the box seals.

Well I'll confess now, I've been keeping it a secret for so long I'm glad I can come out about my Bitcoin losses. 
It was summer of 2013, the fateful day I first got involved, and before I knew it I'd brought some, at roughly $100 each! you see I had $5000 going spare and thought what the heck I brought around 50 over that summer.
Well, what can I say, to cut a long story short, it crashed TWICE since then over 80% in each case. Once would have beeen bad enough.
For gods sake people don't buy Bitcoin, it just keeps crashing, and I still have 40 of these god forsaken things. God damit!

Yes because I lost track of the purchase of my historic, (pre 2014 Bitcoin) and also I flipped between coins using shapeshift and such, so I wouldn't be able to answer anti money laundering questions from my UK bank and thus, apparently they would freeze my account if I tried to cash out large sums. This is the main reason I was forced to hold most of my Bitcoin and hope that one day I could spend it directly or sell for cash in person etc.
Now the price is low again I am going to buy, but this time it will be legitimate, buying through Coinbase I will keep all records and if the price goes through the roof again. I should be able to cash out and pay my taxes no problem.

Actually your spot on, and even though you aren't as heavily invested in Bitcoin as me, at least you are aware of it and know how to buy, sell and store so you are ready for if there's a time that you want or need to put a higher percentage in. 
I've got quite a large percentage in Bitcoin but it is an amount I can afford to loose, built up over the 4 years that I have owned it. I also have mortgage paid and other housing that I rent out plus ordinary shares in companies and have always been a believer in the "dogs of the ftse/dow" type strategy.

A medium of exchange needs no intrinsic value itself, fiat definitely fits this. It needs to be trusted, a store of value, portable, divisible, scarce, available to anyone and difficult to make. Bitcoin is most of these and is improving all the time.
So we disagree on what is of value (but you haven't told me what you think is valuable yet). The trouble with your argument is it's difficult to explain why Bitcoin has gone from nothing to over 100 billion over a period of 10 years, if it is as you say, just a freak.

When your buying something for say $4000 isn't it so much more satisfying to know that it cost nearly $4000 to create? We are talking credibility here.
And there's nothing in Bitcoins code to say that the electricity used to mine has to come from fossil fuels, power generation will become greener in time and Bitcoin mining will become more environmentally friendly due to halvenings, difficulty adjustment and use of greener energy.
For anything to overtake Bitcoin, just a bit better wont do, it will have to be one hell of a lot better to overtake it's massive network effect now. The ledger now stands like a monument to truth and trust, built on the aforementioned ,very costly proof of work. There is literally nothing on the horizon, or you can imagine that is much better at the moment. All current alternatives sacrifice decentralization and proof of work in order to perform some party piece like cheaper and quicker transactions, but like I say when it comes to money it's plausibility and credibility that gives it 90% of it's worth.

So let's get this straight, it's 2028 and best case scenario, several more countries currencies would have gone tits up by then and there is high inflation and low interest rates even for the more stable economies due to the continued quantitate easing, there is still bank bailouts while where people have to watch the bank CEO's get away with it while still claiming big bonuses.
Meanwhile Bitcoin has survived 20 years without a single successful attack as the ultimate ledger. It has been over the years developed and now has reliable level 2 scaling. It has proof of work limited supply and decentralized nature. It stands like a shining monument to the ultimate truth and trust. Also has no barriers to entry so everyone in the world can join in.
Yet this guy thinks there is more than a fair chance that Bitcoin could stand at $100 which is the same a saying that no one is going to be interested in it. WTF

So just before the 9th of March'18, at about the same time as the blackest days in Bitcoins history, with the value plunging, some researcher asked a rather loaded question about the similarity of Bitcoin to tulip bulbs. LMAO
Are you not surprised that in this setting most commenters aired towards agreement in similarity? This is a bit like researching if people think that Islam is a peaceful religion straight after 9/11. 
I know if the same research was done today, what with Bitcoin clearly forming a strong support the opinion would be a lot better in favour of Bitcoin.

It's difficult to imagine though, I think the only next logical step is when humankind live completely without money as everybody's needs are catered for, and people have also evlolved not to covet materialistic possessions.

@_date: 2018-11-05 16:52:17
My calculation
A miner will spend nominally $4000 mining a coin, the rest is equipment, labour, property and profit, mining a coin on average happens every 10 minutes so 144 ten minute periods in a day so, 4000 x 144 = $576,000 of electricity a day. It's not much, and there's nothing in the Bitcoin protocol to say this has to be electricity made from fossil fuel.

Yeah sounds reasonable. But that will just send property into a ridiculous bubble again, and what if a desperate government starts to confiscate property like has happened with gold in the past, you can't hide property.

I strongly believe that those with too much influence are collecting Bitcoins now, over the counter from people that are ignorant of these facts. These people will find out the value of proof of work when it is all too late.

They won't be able to do anywhere near the same fractional reserve as they have in the past with other currencies. Bitcoin is too easy for anyone to store and it's too obvious to check the actual supply of bitcoins compared to the banks claims. 
Basically if I had Bitcoin in one of these banks and discovered that they only had say 50% reserves, I would be thinking about getting my coins out before everyone else does because I can easily store it myself.
But on the plus side, the doors being open to trade and normalization that this would bring will far outweigh the harm of fractional reserve.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:34:28
It would be RELATIVELY simple because, like I say who would contend such a move? Also, is this not a feature of any blockchain, including the ones government and banks like? Agree that damage could be done though.

For all the reasons above. 
Plus there's nothing in Bitcoins code saying that the energy has to come via fossil fuels
But ultimately if anyone thinks that this will be a silver bullet to kill Bitcoin then they are very much mistaken. They can bleat on as much as they like but Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck, it's difficulty can adjust to suit any situation and mines can be set up anywhere.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:27:45

@_date: 2018-03-30 16:26:44
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; 
If you can dream- -and not make dreams your master; 
If you can think- -and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same:.
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools; 
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings,
And never breathe a word about your loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on! '
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son!

It's a good point, in the not too distant future renewables will be cheaper than fossil fuel, especially solar in desert areas. Miners will set up there. In fact this would also be good for decentralization.
The main problem is China that generates electricity via fossil fuel and gives it away too cheaply.

What a heart felt and well presented story OP, I really enjoyed reading it. I first stumbled on bitcoin from a bit of research I was doing in cryptography, going towards my math degree. it was autumn 2014, and the price was already crashed from a previous high. I figured that if I invest immediately then I can't do any better than that, fortunately I did have the capital so put 10% of my worth in. I am a HODLER and a believer in bitcoin, we don't know where the price is going short to mid term but long term I think there is at least 80% chance of going to the moon. No matter how bad things get I always remember three basic facts. Scarcity and limited supply. The existing money system is broke and the army of developers that are just excited about improving Bitcoin and don't care about the price, recent history has proven never ignore something that a geek gets excited about. Anyway hope you can continue to hold long enough to see your day in the sun. And if not maybe you can make a career in writing.

So about 100 GJ to make a bitcoin at current rates, so roughly of the order of 1/100,000 of the total global energy rate of consumption. 
Sound pretty reasonable to me since we are making a world class proper hard currency here, unlike Fiat that is just willed into existance.
And remember nothing in the code says that this energy has to come from fossil fuels.

It can be divided to 100,000,000 satoshi and even more if maybe.
 
20k certainly was a bubble and may go lower still yet,  but I'm talking long term and I believe in the concepts of hard limits, decentralization and proof of work that makes Bitcoin the hardest currency the world has ever known.
Personally when my daughter was growing up from a baby to age 10, I never kept making comments like she is useless as a person and very unpredictable, because I knew that when she grew up now 20 she would be successful and make me proud, I view Bitcoin the same and on a similar time frame. 
At the moment Bitcoin has to exist as a new technology working in an old infrastructure, like the first automobiles before gas stations and proper roads, don't fall into criticising Bitcoin in the same way that commenters criticised early cars.
Thanks for the chat anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-06 06:32:12
My thoughts exactly. There's nothing in Bitcoins protocol saying the energy for mining must come from fossil fuel, it's all the worlds governments that need to address this problem, but whatever they do Bitcoin will survive as it's difficulty will adjust to suit.

Not that I disagree with the headline, but seriously I started watching and couldn't be bothered to finnish. The guy doesn't even show a graph, and I think the point he is getting to is simply that this bear market and subsequent bull run will be similar in scale and duration to the last.
I, like a lot of people have already come to that conclusion right at the start of the bear market.
So are you sure it's worth watching to the end, it really is hard work.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:18:17
Well if is Bitcoins fucked then everybody with savings is fucked too.
Because when the economy collapses because of the trillions of debt growing in an exponential fashion, and we end up with very high or hyper inflation possibly even bank runs, there will be nowhere viable to turn to safeguard your wealth. I'm more afraid of this scenario than my current Bitcoin holding losing value to be honest.
I know, some may be shouting GOLD but LMAO, it really hasn't got anywhere near the convenience of Bitcoin hasn't it?
I continue to hold strong and thinking of buying soon too.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:08:58
Well with Bitcoin it sort of can. What if you tell them you mined it in the first few years of bitcoin? How can they prove you wrong?

I may have the exact same problem myself soon, it was a very long time ago that I brought my bitcoin and have done some trading here and there since so haven't really got any records or hard evidence. I was thinking of telling anyone who wants to know that I mined my bitcoin way back when it started, how can they prove that is not the case? But I will talk to my manager to ask if there's going to be a problem. Hope it goes well for you.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:59:54
So you have shorted since the drop?
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:59:01
Up around 4000%, been in crypto 4 years and flipped in and out of ETH making a killing. But 80% Bitcoin now, still very happy with investment.
Edit, and when I brought my first Bitcoins the mood was VERY similar to how it is now.
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:24:07
But what stops some bad actor successfully putting on really sick files or bomb making information? Just so you know I am heavily invested in Bitcoin and all other FUD I ignore but this one is really freaking me out. My two thoughts are could anything be done hard fork wise and/or remove illicit material, and is there another blockchain currency that does not have this superfluous data that can be abused in this way?
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:06:38
It's a good point, if you just ignore last November/December things are pretty normal as far as most investments go.
Why so serious? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:40:19
So that guy hasn't lost hasn't he, he brought for 50 and got 50 back.
No read your original statement and it certainly is nonsense.
If you just wrote "people will be dumping to stop future losses" then that WOULD make sense.

Right you need to spend some time learning about this, you really are very green.

1. Because creating that bitcoin took a horrific amount of energy, that gives it a certain credibility that you can't get from other non proof of work money like fiat that can be created for nothing by certain circles.
2. Security, if it costs an horrific amount to win a block then you are going to make damn certain that it is correct.
3. What's wrong with using an horrific amount of energy that comes from renewables. There's nothing in the Bitcoin protocol that says it has to use energy from carbon creating fossil fuels.

@_date: 2018-11-15 09:04:53
True, I think over the last few months we have picked up another crowd of short term buyers who brought because they thought the stability meant it had bottomed out and going to start going up again. I think this is a shakeout of these impatient people. 
Yes I've been in Bitcoin for over 4 years now, when I first brought it felt like a similar climate to now, but very glad that I did buy still.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:49:32
You wont because I will buy them all before you at $3.02
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:56:20
If you invested in Bitcoin as soon as you become aware of it like I did 4 years ago, then that is all that you could have done.
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:32:18
Not really, just the knowledge that something DID take a lot of work to produce gives it more plausible value.

Agree with the first statement, but why do you believe that it will drop like that, at about the same time we get lightning wallets, fees drop to nearly zero and bitcoin celebrates 10 years of perfect security and trust, with all the positive media attention that will get.

Yes but allowed again in 1964 and only US affected, also about the time they called in the military in to start shooting people so US was on the brink of totalitarianism which is the point I'm making. Remember all countries will have to move in unison but even then it will be useless. How the fuck are you going to stop someone memorizing a 12 word seed, by saying it's illegal? And remember in this apocalyptic scenario whereby the government has to make Bitcoin illegal to stop the plunging local currency, which could be the only plausible reason, thus turning that country rogue, then it always goes hand in hand with people in authority taking bribes, and guess what they are going to want to be paid in?

But this view assumes that bitcoin is just purely speculative and does not develop and improve, and we know that this is not the case. I think we are in for a rough ride over the first half of this year possibly as low as $4000, but the new developments will become too compelling long term, remember this time we are on the big investors radar.

If you are waiting for 2k before you buy your first Bitcoin I think you are making a mistake for two reasons.
Firstly it's unlkikely in my opinion unless there is a major fault with Bitcoin. So you will not buy Bitcoin.
Second IF it did go to 2k, maybe because of a reason like above, with your always chasing the bottom mentality you will be looking for 1k or less. So you will not buy Bitcoin.
And never buying Bitcoin, wealth wise is a much bigger mistake than buying and seeing your investment loose before going to the moon.
My advice buy slowly over the next year and be happy

@_date: 2018-03-24 09:05:32
I think we need a blockchain techie to explain what can be done to save bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies IF this does prove to be a problem.

Point 4, the OP doesn't realize that Bitcoin is Blockchains ultimate application. 
Points 2,3 and 5 say roughly the same thing, we all know there's a lot if fickle people out there.

Points 1, 7 and 8 have elements of truth but time and patience will tell.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:23:24
Same applies with cashing in forked coins like BCH, you have to expose your private key which means that if your computer was infected it could grab that private key and someone could steal your coins. OK this might seem unlikely but we are talking belt and braces here. Best to sweep the entire wallet onto a web wallet like electrum, take what you want then send back to another paper wallet if that's how you want to store it. Do Bitcoin first then deal with your forked coins in a similar way immediately, it's a bit of a faf though. This is where hard ware wallets really score if you actually want to use some of your holdings so you may want to think of investing in one of those.

So who is forcing you to use bitcoin? In the UK I must use the pound for all my purchases and pay my taxes even though the pound coins themselves have little value.

I was really concerned about this issue, but reading this has helped allay my worries. Firstly the fact that there is no intent from blockchain holders to want to see this sick form of vandalism, look up "mens rea" meaning for more on this. So we won't be seeing innocent people being prosecuted for having a bitcoin node. Second IF it does become a legal problem in a lot of countries there are blockchain workarounds that effectively put the illicit material out of reach of node holders.

IRON! WTF, are you from the fucking 1800's or something.
The context of your first reply suggested that you thought Bitcoin requires extra processing. You used a question mark as if my statement was questionable. If you can be pedantic so can I.
The truth is I'm not even that interested in the original article, but as always I like to question the faults in an opinion piece, and I found a glaringly obvious fault in this one.

Banning cryptocurrency for no good reason other that the fact they don't like it would be a step towards a totalitarian system. Really what possible reason could there be to ban the ownership of a private key, who is the victim of such a crime? At the end of the day Bitcoin is not like methamphetamine so they know it would be unreasonable to just ban it. And it certainly won't  happen in any westernized country that have wants to continue trumpeting freedom and liberty.

Good point, and GBP is much worse, taking the year I was born 1971, it has lost 93%. effectively £1 back then is equivalent to £14.2 now. The limited supply means this cannot happen with bitcoin as a result of inflation or as I like to put it, as a result of the government stealing it by printing more money, effectively diluting the money in your pocket. I know some are going to say that the volatility of bitcoin is much worse but there are different forces driving that. Just remember there will only be 21 million or less and no one can stop it.

Thanks, but I'm aware of how the system should work. However 1970 to 1980 in England inflation was average of 13%, and yes I think this is a form of theft, the government was printing money big time as causing high inflation reduced their debt. Also Hyper inflation can and does happen to countries. I'll repeat his CANNOT happen with bitcoin. And yes I don't have much love for bankers, do you?

It relies too heavily on another crypto currency coming out that trumps Bitcoin. LMAO.
It assumes that Bitcoin is static and can't evolve and is ignorant to the fact that developers are sorting out the scaling issue and high fees as we speak.

Just trying to say that your reaction is the same for most people when they first look into this. To answer you first post "where is the real value of this currency", I'd say that even if Bitcoin does fail to scale up, it still could achieve a market cap comparable to that of gold. And before you do, PLEASE don't wheel out the old "but it has no intrinsic value" argument. I have heard it million times over the years and so has everyone else who has been into these for a long period.

Even if I knew full well the price would go from 10k to 8k it still won't be a good reason to sell. The reason is I would have to pay my government 20% CGT, not to mention other trading costs.

In England, where I live and some parts of US you had to have someone run in front carrying a flag, they where ridiculed by many, and had these ridiculous regulations imposed. Sounds familiar doesn't it. 
"Red flag laws in the United States[edit]
In the United States, the state of Vermont passed a similar flurry of Red Flag Laws in 1894. The most infamous of the Red Flag Laws was enacted in Pennsylvania circa 1896, when legislators unanimously passed a bill through both houses of the state legislature, which would require all motorists piloting their "horseless carriages", upon chance encounters with cattle or livestock to (1) immediately stop the vehicle, (2) "immediately and as rapidly as possible ... disassemble the automobile", and (3) "conceal the various components out of sight, behind nearby bushes" until equestrian or livestock is sufficiently pacified.[1] The bill did not become law, as the Governor of Pennsylvania used an executive veto."

But could you be sure that every time this happens it isn't some sort of inside job, with the owners using an accomplice maybe? With crypto currencies it's far too easy for faceless anonymous thieves to get away with impunity unlike the examples you give.

No compare to the internet from about 1984 to 1993 is more realistic, it is still in early adoption. And that's a bit like asking how horseless carriages had improved the average persons life in 1900. 
Bitcoin will become the fast, virtually feeless decentralized platform of ultimate trust, it will just take time. 
Then may be in 10 or 20 years people will be able to own a currency that cannot be taken away from them via inflation, a currency that has been created through proof of work unlike fiat, the unbanked masses can bank themselves and so empowering them, micro payment could be made and this is something that can change our lives in ways we cant even imagine. No more bankers taking excessive bonuses while running us into recession with impunity. I am very bullish long term, although I agree that there may be a bumpy ride for a few years. But to say it is worth virtually nothing is ridiculous and shows little imagination.

Here's a game that anyone who says this should play. Get the long term stock market data of any company that you know nothing about, don't look at it and zoom in on the price from about a few years back. So you are only looking at the monthly chart from a few years ago and you don't know what is going to happen as you slowly advance forward to the next day. From the chart try to guess which way it will go, actually write down predictions where you would buy and sell and keep a running tally of what you would of made. Now if you can get this right the majority of times you might as well quit work now and become a day trader. The fact is you won't be able to and all your comments are just done with the benefit of hindsight.

Even the intrinsic value argument isn't a good one though, few things do have intrinsic value. Like what is the intrinsic value of gold? Because of it's shininess? And if it was so useful for industry and jewellery why is the vast majority locked up in vaults gathering dust? There are far more useful elements. No It's value is mostly in it's rarity. When it comes to it the only things that do have real intrinsic value are the things that are needed to survive, food, water, shelter.

To wheel out that old chestnut, about it not being backed shows that you are either very ignorant or very stupid. 
You claim you have learned about money, but to intelligent people it usually comes fairly early on in the learning curve that ALL money is mainly a shared illusion of value. 
Time and again over the last few decades people who can't get their heads around the fact that something that can't be held in your hand CAN have value, have lost out. This trend will continue to happen to people like you.

What do you class as a theft? If you have money on an exchange without private keys you have GIVEN the hackers your Bitcoin in my opinion, so no theft.
I own my private keys and they are very secure, so I believe that having them stolen, whilst not impossible, is as likely as a cosmic event wiping all of us out, so not worth worrying about.

Not saying what you say is impossible but here are several points
Your title is wrong, as the vast majority of millionaires would be people who mined back in the early days.
Criminals have always used new tech to their advantage, like guns and cars aiding bank robberies.
We know technology is a double edged sword from fire that provides warmth to being used as a weapon to nuclear fission used to generate electricity but can literally destroy us all.
How do you know these people didn't cash out shortly after making their ill gotten gains?
Why use this to pick on Bitcoin as it is now. Bitcoin 2018?
Finally I am angered that you just used poor evidence in order to create a title that includes Bitcoin, murderer, rapist, paedophile (correct spelling) in the title. Because I can assure you it is the last thing that 99.999999999 people think of at the word Bitcoin.

At which point "HODLers of last resort" that wont sell at any price will give support, and from the other side there will be those who FOMO on another bull run as bitcoin has proven time and again that this does happen.

@_date: 2018-04-04 18:14:40
So based on the fact that, since your son told you about bitcoin it has gone down in price you think you have earned the right to be self righteous in your decision to ignore him. I can't spend too much time on this, but simply look at any long term chart, of course it isn't going to increase in value smoothly, it will do the same as in the past and keep reaching new all time highs in an erratic manner. The problem you have is when it does increase massively in value, unlike all the feckless sheeple, you can't claim to have been uninformed and unaware since your son did advise you.
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:05:26
Yes this is what I would do, I've noticed lots of traders do have their direct contact numbers, although I am a bit nervous about doing the deals. Ideally I would prefer money paid into my account and pay taxes etc. But since banks seem to be making this difficult due to KYC/AML, especially with large sums I feel that I'm forced to do it this way, in which case fuck the taxes! This is the irony, unless anyone can advise me otherwise.

OK so a Bitcoin is approximately equivalent to $7800 at time of writing. And that because just like any other currency enough other people believe it's worth that. Stop trying to find intrinsic value because it's a fallacy. In fact a medium of exchange's intrinsic value is  an oxymoron.
Government regulations (eyes roll). Who's government? how many governments?, to what extent is the ban? This is only going to be effective if vast majority of governments, including all those elected democratically are simultaneously going to ban cryptocurrency at ownership level against their electorates wishes for no good reason other than, they don't like it. Remember these governments can't even come to agreement on something that is really important, like climate change.

Bitcoin exists because governments have shown - over and over - that they are not to be trusted with the levers of monetary policy.
In an ideal world, centralised is *always* better. On-the-hoof decisions, fine-tuning, reaction &amp; anticipation can extract efficiencies and improvements which a 'dumb' monetary policy like Bitcoin's cannot. But we do not live in an ideal world, far from it.
Bitcoin exists to protect us from the reality that, if you give other humans control of that which you hold dear, they'll screw you over. Maybe intentionally, maybe not, but it's always only a matter of time.

There is no comparison, Bitcoin takes away supply inflation by fiat controlling banks and governments, and this is by FAR the MOST important aspect, everything else you mention is just garnish that is either being worked on, would improve anyway or otherwise prove to be insignificant. Bitcoin is great store of wealth that hedges against supply inflated fiat, reasonable to call it gold 2.0. 
120 years ago someone like you would have totally missed the point with horseless carriages too.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:38:20
Yes there will be some fractional reserve but no where near 100x. Unlike gold Bitcoin is too easy to check supply, move and store oneself, and this will get even better in future. Thus any trustees reserve would need to be much greater. So I still believe that the positive effect on Bitcoins valuation will far outweigh the negative effect of the illusion of their being more BTC in circulation.
My belief is that when these BTC trusts get established 5 years plus Bitcoin will go much like gold has and increase greatly in value to rival golds market cap then level off and become much more stable.

You know Bitcoin, the protocol works like a charm, it can't be stopped, the genie is out of the bottle now. And for it to be worth nominally as much as it costs to make, what great credibility that gives it over fiat.

And conversely we had a situation of miners holding on to their Bitcoin end of last year, so drying up supply. This is one reason why the market has wild swings, way overshooting fair value to the upside last year, and the downside like now.

No sympathy
