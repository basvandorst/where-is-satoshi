I understand your point. The time delay is possible; but you know how,the people dont like wait if spend money. Another thing is the download: the website dont store "in site" the files, and every transaction have one unique url for the downloadwe decided it was better to keep the two sections, separated so as to be sure that payments are made.
The rating of the files is one exellent idea! 
We have one rss for the lates uploads ( and automatic share on the social, but i think this is one cool function. Thank you!

We work on it, for the file search. I agree with you, is something helpful. Also the rating of the files, could be very useful to users and in searches on search engines. Thank you! :)

Thank you for your impression! Well you are right... it is possible people use this for "different" uses. But the staff of the website is pretty active to delete and report wrong contents. =)

Thank you guys!Your suggestions are really precious!
 Great ideas! :)
After you have upload one file, you have many options: share on the socials, and creations of custom payment buttons for websites.
 Thank you!
If you see the popup "OOPS" is becouse you have use the right click...If you not upload probably you try with files up 15MB.
But this limit is only temporary; probably become like 100/150MB.
The minimum price required is 0.01, for now is for everyone.
