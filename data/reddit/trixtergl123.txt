Apparently this issue was complained in this thread: 
Nobody knows exactly if is temporarly or not but i am worried since the fee is so low and child pay for parent doesn't work.

Thank you so much bro, i really do. This tool is amazing, if someone from Viabtc see this thread i wish them all the best and thank them for what they are doing, in such cases like mine where the solution is far away, the community helps and make the dream go on. Wish to all  best wishes!

Hello guys, i transffered all my coins into electrum from multibit Hd after i got many errors with multibit that didn't recognise the password and i could recover the wallet only with secret words. The problem is now Electrum tells me the fee is low and i tried the child pay for parent option trying few servers already and after i sign confirming the password and 2FA auth, it gets me all the time error: 402. Tell me what can i do? I picked 10 blocks confirmation but i get error:402 HTTP all the time, need help
