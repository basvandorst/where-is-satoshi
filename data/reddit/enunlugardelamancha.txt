No, we (Europe) are not.


Do you even watch the news? Putin recently annexed a peninsula and the only thing Europe could do is watch and call him rude.

Uh, of course they "use crypto". Just not in the way you may expect.

That you are planning to borrow money from a drug dealer proves alone that you are being stupid.

Nobody uses gas as a currency so your comparison is stupid.

Unlike its Argentinian counterpart, the Venezuelan central bank has not hidden the inflation data as far as I know.

And where can you buy/sell billions of dollars of bitcoin at a time while having a stable value of bitcoin? 
Bitcoin can not fix anything here. That you can move billions of bitcoin easily in the blockchain means nothing, you still need a huge volume to convert to the local currencies. If anything, bitcoin makes the transaction more difficult because of volatility.

No depth. Oil transactions need to be made in markets that can trade many billions every day without the price being affected, even the vast majority of state currencies are unable to deal with that, which is why they end up using the USD.

If mtgox increase somewhat significantly their transaction fees, it should have the effect of a tobin tax for the mtgox exchanges (discourage speculative exchange). But BTC is a free market, people wouldn't like it and would go to another exchange.

"Mt. Gox estimates it costs $25 million in the first year to become fully [regulatory] compliant in the US" 
IOW, you are going to need investors with deep pockets

For individual holders of Bitcoins, what tworunningcards said. For Bitcoin itself, it means that more people wants to use bitcoins, the market is getting bigger.

He deserved it. mtgox requires identification.

No. The number of potentially usable coins will just be reduced.

This is not how it works. I very much doubt that trading is cpu-bound. The main bottleneck for trading probably is the database. And they also have to provide realtime connection to all users, including users of the API (there are thousands of people checking bitcoinity). And make thousands of bitcoin transactions.

Sorry, but this is not a gaming PC. Just using SSDs doesn't solve anything. mtgox needs to provide absolute reliability, high throughput (as in transactions per second) and low latency. Sure, mtgox is not a professional exchange, but I can not imagine how anyone would call it a "joke".
