How about bitcoin being corrupt, you don’t think companies have large amount of hash power are going to play along? No, they can even stop beneficial forks from happening and completely stop bitcoin from maturing. You you could waste a few million on transactions to clog the mem pool and then grind the world economy to a halt? Not a good idea

So you are saying the US did not have a fiat currency until the 1970s when Nixon Decoupled the currency with gold? IOUs are all any paper currency ever is. And banks did issue their own fiat currencies,  you should read up on America’s free banking era I think you will find it very interesting.  States also did issue their own fiat currency under the articles of confederation and was one of the major weakpoint in it.

But during 1830s-1860s they did, they were also in competition with a wide variety of currencies issued by individual states. And also the US dollar is issued by the Federal Reserve bank which is not a public entity.

They are only a currency because the are denominated as such. Just because gold is the medium used to issue the currency does not make it a currency itself. Just like how paper is not a currency however paper denominated as such is. If the US government issued a gold coin worth a thousand dollars they could, and they would not have to use a thousand dollars worth of gold to do it

Yes but gold isn’t a currency either you are referring to bartering
