Silly post. The single reason your bitcoins are worth anything at all in fiat terms is that people use exchanges, and for that some bitcoin will have to be stored there. Some people reflexively shout "bitsquare" without knowing what it is (and that it has nowhere near the depth of a traditional exchange and that it doesn't free you from counterparty risk). I can only conclude that the people who make such "absolute" statements about storing bitcoin on exchanges are those who got all their bitcoin from faucets.

So the relationship between Kobayashi and Tibanne - the holding company of the bankrupt entity MtGox and the frickin' **former de facto operator** of the exchange seems to be like this:
* Tibanne hold on to mtgox-related data (customer data?)
* They get reimbursed outrageous amounts for purchasing a few HDDs (why again does it need to be Tibanne? Is this a neutral party to this debacle?)
* Then, Tibanne also charge astronomical consulting fees every few months, authorised by Kobayashi, seemingly without further ado. 
This is absolutely amazing.

They understandably can't publicise much about it since it could jeopardise their efforts (also see my post below).
They've allowed Daniel Kelman to state that they would offer the same immediate redistribution of customer funds, would undertake similar efforts to recoup more coins and would give creditors a significantly greater share of equity and dividends, but these details are being worked out.
There's no deadline soon anymore, there will be a creditor's hearing in July and a decision somewhere in November.
@_date: 2014-05-01 08:54:44
I'm not behind any OKcoin deal so I can't give you inside information other than what has been shared by those who are. 
Sunlot had a lot of headway since they had been privy of the trouble at MtGox for months before the actual initial filing for civil rehabilitation. In fact, I strongly believe they are the ones involved in the leaked "Crisis Strategy Draft". They've publicly acknowledged they were ready to take over hours after the filing.
The OKcoin people were made aware of the possibilities of a takeover more recently. They have a team assembled in Tokyo working on details of a rehab plan. The issue is that there's a public holiday period going on these days in Japan ("Golden Week") which lasts until early next week, which constrains some efforts (like discussions with the current trustee). 
Mind you - in contrast to Sunlot, the OKcoin people actually do have experience in running a bitcoin exchange, and for me this also serves as clear evidence they actually do want to run an exchange business (in contrast to Sunlot, who, to me, appear only to be in it to make attractive deals on distressed debt).

@_date: 2014-04-29 04:59:27
This is a terrible, disgusting deal. Read the actual press release and see that those Sunlot bastards still try to take $10 million out of the existing assets and even try to reward themselves even more in the process of doing so.
"An Administration and Prosecution Fund would manage customer interests and the recovery of the approximately $275 million of stolen customer assets. Capitalized by $10 million (3.6% of stolen assets) in MtGox cash held in trust by Nobuaki Kobayashi, the administrator appointed by the Tokyo District Court, the fund would conduct forensic investigations and pursue prosecution of perpetrators. An incentive bounty of 10% of recovered assets would reward those participating in the recovery."
All this is a direct contradiction of things they've stated in their 'support gathering phase', including what now appears to be direct lies on yesterday's Google Hangout.
They've shown themselves for what they are - vultures that can only get what they want through litigation or the threat thereof, of minor defendants. They pick on the half-dead bodies of affected creditors and try to suck as much of the meat out of them as possible. Meanwhile, they tout themselves in the press as the saviours of the bitcoin economy.
Edit: Bruce Fenton here claims 100% of the pro-rata share of recovered customer funds are redistributed, because the $10M would come from corporate, non-customer funds. Let's agree that this here is, again, obvious twisting of the facts, since such "corporate funds" would be part of the total MtGox assets that would be used to settle liabilities. 
Who pays Bruce, and for what?
It may also be interesting to learn that John Betts of Sunlot just stated they had a ready-to-go plan within hours of the initial bankruptcy filing and were ready to takeover on the morning of February 25th. To me this is highly suggestive both that Sunlot had insider knowledge of the dire financial situation at MtGox for weeks or months beforehand, and also that they were the party to execute the ideas mentioned in the "Crisis Strategy Draft" leaked by Two Bit Idiot.

For the record, this is an older rehabilitation plan in which certain deals are certainly not beneficial for affected account holders. For example, it was proposed that MtGox assets be used to start up the new exchange and no outside investment be done.

No, but they've done quite a few things that arguably make them look very suspicious:
- secretly (i.e. without creditors' consent) submitted a plan that would have taken out funding for business expenses from existing assets, in which customers' funds would have been held locked for a minimum of one year, etc (see the March 28th leaked document)
- only after their plan was leaked did they realise they need to reach out to customers
- falsely stated through lots of media outlets that 70% of creditors, weighed by the size of their losses, backed their plan (this has been more or less confirmed to be a lie).
To be clear, no one should risk capital without a plan for payout. But in their plans there is no balance between their own capital investments and those taken out from existing assets, nor is there a balance between the huge payoffs and their own investment.

Investigators work to close the net in Mt Gox probe
 
By Ben McLannahan in Tokyo
The website of Mt. Gox, showing a statement after the company went offline, is displayed on a laptop computer in an arranged photograph in Tokyo, Japan, on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2014. Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange that halted withdrawals this month, went offline as a document surfaced alleging long-term theft of about $365 million in the digital currency. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg©Bloomberg
 
Six months on from the apparent theft at Mt Gox, once the world’s biggest Bitcoin exchange, the net could be beginning to close.
 
Late last month police in Tokyo said they had launched a formal fraud investigation into the disappearance of as many as 650,000 bitcoins reported missing by the Shibuya-based exchange. In the meantime, a small local group of experts led by Jason Maurice of Wiz Technologies, a security consultancy, is pursuing an independent probe, convinced that the culprit – or culprits – can be traced.
 
According to Mr Maurice, a 29-year-old native of Honolulu whose business card describes him as “chief hacking officer”, the most likely explanation for the disappearance of the bitcoins is a series of raids beginning last year, in which a hacker gained access to Mt Gox’s database of account holders, assigned himself new accounts with faked cash balances, then bought and withdrew the virtual currency at will.
 
The control systems set up under Mt Gox chief Mark Karpelès were so basic that the thefts went undetected, he claims.
 
“There were no processes to realise that coins were leaking,” says Mr Maurice. “It looked like normal customers withdrawing money; Mark didn’t know that thousands of coins were being stolen every day.”
 
Among the Bitcoin community, there are still unanswered questions for Mr Karpelès, who pulled down the shutters at Mt Gox at the end of February, saying he had lost track of 850,000 bitcoins then worth $480m. In the weeks that followed – during which Mt Gox announced it had discovered 200,000 bitcoins in an “old-format” wallet – rumours swirled that the chief executive knew more than he was letting on.
 
Protests grew louder after a report was published online in May, based on an analysis of trading data leaked in early March. The report detailed the activities of two automated computer programmes that appeared to run rampant on Mt Gox last year, apparently using IDs linked to Mr Karpelès, and operating during periods when the exchange was offline to regular users.
 
It is unclear who wrote the May report. The March data were leaked by an internet relay chat user called “Nanashi” (Japanese for “anonymous”), who some believe is a former employee of Mt Gox.
 
Mr Karpelès told the Financial Times that he was willing to speak, but has yet to grant that interview and could not be reached for comment. Last month he made his first public appearance since the scandal broke to make a personal apology to creditors at a bankruptcy hearing in Tokyo.
 
Mr Maurice says he is sure that Mr Karpelès has no direct link to the vanishing coins, arguing that the 29-year-old Frenchman lacks the “social intelligence” necessary to pull off a sustained deception. Any apparent connections to the Mt Gox chief set out in the May report, he says, are the hallmark of a hacker trying to lay a false trail. By his reckoning, the bots “spent” a total of $185m on 567,000 bitcoins, after fees, in the 10 months to the end of November.
 
Former employees and associates also doubt that Mr Karpelès is a criminal mastermind, painting a portrait of a talented programmer out of his depth in running a fast-growing exchange. They describe developers spending hours playing video games such as Diablo and Minecraft in the chief executive’s absence, and frequent security breaches – the latest as recently as June, when a lone female was filmed entering the offices of Tibanne, Mt Gox’s former parent company, apparently via an access card left by a postman.
 
Others claim there were sloppy reporting systems. Documents seen by the Financial Times show that Mt Gox claimed to have processed trades worth a total of Y1.05tn ($10bn) in the six months to November last year, earning commissions of Y560m in the process.
 
But when Bitcoin Association president Bruce Fenton approached Mr Karpelès in February in a bid to support the ailing platform, he says he was shown unaudited accounts “which looked like something somebody threw together on their own Excel spreadsheet”.
 
“We used to joke that we’d all end up in jail,” says one former Mt Gox employee, referring to mounting cash transfers and the gathering of deposits without a banking licence. “Everyone knew we had problems.”
 
Mr Maurice, who founded Wiz a year after arriving in Tokyo in 2005, says he has a list of “potential suspects” – based on the leaked data and deeper analysis of other trading-log data available on sites such as Bitcoinwisdom, a ticker-tape aggregator. But he says he needs full access to the Mt Gox database of customer addresses in order to cross-reference suspicious trades against the blockchain, the central ledger that logs all transfers between Bitcoin addresses.
 
“If we can reconcile everything, we can figure out where the money went.”

MK may have been ultimately responsible in terms of the power structure within the company. Such structures don't release individuals from their personal responsibility though. Maybe he did his best to solve the problems within the company, but I think the chances are greater he had the same tunnel vision and criminal negligence as MK.
Talking about responsibility, they also had an internal accountant, and probably an external one too. These people can face claims too and I'm sure Kobayashi is well versed in that.

They still select payment type at the counter. If you sit out somewhere and you're brought a check, the choice of payment type is usually made afterwards.

Not only is the ignorance displayed here staggering, it also diverts attention from the real issues at hand. First, exchange between bitcoin and fiat currencies is not a one-way avenue as some here believe it is. Apart from the doom signs, it is completely legitimate to leave money on an exchange for frequent traders. Second: what is this nonsense about 'not being able to beat bots' as a human daytrader? Come on now...

Kolin somehow never bothered to update his blog. I wonder what's behind that, someone asked him not to post anymore? Lack of interest? The latter is rather unlikely IMHO.

It would be nice, but the thing is that right now, Booking.com doesn't usually process payments for hotels booked through its site. It keeps the creditcard info in case of late cancellations or no-show.

The Winklevoss twins also known as the Winklevii are two gorgeous men, lets be real here, they have never had any trouble with the ladies. They are very rich, and also very handsome. 
If you didn’t know already, these two angelic men have competed in the men’s rowing event at the 2008 Bejing Olympics, which only made their biceps and triceps larger.
I would like the ETF to get approved, I do not think there is any reason for the ETF to not get approved, this is a great thing for bitcoin.

I think you might have misread. Every central bank has the power to print money. In most systems, however, private banks can also create money by making loans and such. Iceland proposes to restrict this power to their central bank.

Without having spoken to him directly, I’m positive he clearly has a cluster B personality disorder. But there are probably additional factors at play such as commercial interests (with nChain, players in the BCH field, etc).
