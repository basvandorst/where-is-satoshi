Quantum computers are a threat to encryption as a whole not just Bitcoin and crypto currencies. Everything from your emails to any accounts that you have online protected by a password is in danger of being cracked by quantum computers.

Good riddance.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:48:30
As much as I like EOS I don't think it's meant for that. There are others which are significantly faster and cheaper.

Personally bittrex was my first experience with an exchange and it is pretty darn good but has high fees when withdrawing. And there's this huge problem with ID verification without which you can't withdraw. Coming to binance I started using it recently since I wanted to buy some coins which weren't available on bittrex and I had an awesome experience too and your exchange fee is cut in half if you pay with BNB. And it supports a lot of coins and gives forked coins fairly quickly.

The market cap itself isn't a trillion yet so how can he become a trollionaire?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:30:41
Really click baity

Back to r/btc you go
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:55:36
Coinomi is a good wallet and supports multiple alt coins along with Bitcoin and it has an in app exchange as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:13:26
I don't know what BCash offers that litecoin or hell even vertcoin doesn't already. It doesn't have anything to stand on other than the fact that it was forked from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:40:07
For someone who claims to have "background in technology" you don't seem to know how the blockchain works which is evident from you not knowing how it takes such long times for transactions to go through.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:22
Even that seems highly unlikely the way it's swinging right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:56:49
I've had that experience myself when trying to verify a new account on Bittrex but the one that I have verified works just fine. But I also feel that something seems off with Bitfinex and  Bittrex too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:01:22
I didn't know that you could buy BTC on Bittrex unless something has changed since last night.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:58:52
Impending ,yes. It's more of a reality than people realise.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:23:21
Is that in retarded format or standard format ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:27:20
Maybe used my referal code if you think I was of help. 10992562

For one, the iota that I had on Bitfinex when I tried to withdraw it to my wallet got cancelled but also shows negative balance( got deducted from my account) I don't know how to get it back even though it is just a couple of iota I'm getting really pissed when I see iota's price go up since those would have been worth so much more.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:22:18
You use litecoin or hundreds of other coins designed for that except BCash.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:34:12
Damn, just checked there's no no panic mode on the coinmarketcap app but there's on the cryptomarketcap app. It basically turns both red and green colour of your % change to white .
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:33:55
What's a deflationary coin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:12:28
Someone should.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:22:42
You're kidding right ?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:38:14
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:32:51
But won't the coins (especially 980k) of them suddenly put into circulation cause a plummet in the value of BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:05:27
This video is a ELI5 on how Bitcoin futures work mostly on the later part of the video.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:20:59
Zebpay or unocoin and store in their own wallet or transfer to any of the many mobile/desktop wallet. Coinomi, blockchain wallet or free wallet comes to mind. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:19:35
State run crypto currency defeats the purpose of decentralization and crypto as a whole.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:00:49
Oh I didn't know that, about the zero fee. Thanks for the info guess I should look into it more.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:45:50
Who's the man you're talking about ?
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:42:56
Your post or the post that you've linked ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:48
Wtf. That's ridiculous. I see a lot of people in India turning to Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:07:39
Great video. No wonder he was given 50 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:56:47
Lol sure. You definitely know everything about my education.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:35:18
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:17:02
Probably a glitch, you can switch on no panic mode if color is a problem. And coinmarketcap doesn't give the price on a single exchange but weighted average of prices on different exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:09:21
Whatever you say buddy.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:34:27
Are you from Bangalore by any chance ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:19:26
Where are the mods?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:17
Nice b8 m8
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:17:54
Definitely spam orders to increase the backlog of transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:22:04
What if when you see it dipping and you sell it and it shoots right back up. You'd then be having the regret of not holding and/or buy back at a higher rate. Not considering the transaction fees and commission you had to pay.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:55:06
Can you teach me how to set up a segwit address or at least point me in the right direction?
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:38:43
I don't have much understanding about that but I've seen segwit blocks at 1 mb+
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:16:33
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:13:01
That makes it BTC 'deposit' not withdrawal if I'm not wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:29:11
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:06:17
And not to forget about margin trading/binary options where you can lose all of your money in one go. So unless you really know about trading you're better off holding or increasing the time difference from selling high and buying back low again which essentially becomes holding.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:03:38
With the number of typos in your comment, I sure do believe you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:07:31
Yeah that is worrying. Hopefully they implement quantum resistance as I've heard they're already working on it(not BTC in particular).
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:56:51
I would like to know too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:05:57
I guess they have already lost a significant amount in their last sell off to make Bitcoin Cash the new Bitcoin so I think they'd think twice before they try to pull that stunt again.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:50:48
Can you explain what a segwit wallet is and how to use it?
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:00:05
I think you are unaware that it's called ethereum 'classic' and not ethereum 'cash' 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:44:20
They are in Satoshis which can also be seen as percentage of a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:35:04
Lol guess so
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:54:51
You should look at the status using your transaction hash. Since the BTC usually gets deducted from the sender immediately but doesn't reach the receiver until "transaction confirmations" are made. Search you txn hash at:  
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:32:36
Segwit maybe ?
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:32:34
I'd argue that Bittrex is up there on top with the ones you mentioned.
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:08:34
You can enter your BTC address on blockchain.info too and track the transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:33:56
I can't see any link over here.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:13:00
Get the unofficial Reddit apps they are much better than the official one- by a newer Reddit user too.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:16:34
How's that a great news ?
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:22:49
Maybe it has something to do with the ban of usage of electricity for mining in some parts of China? I'm not sure.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:23:40
Or HODL because you stand a risk of losing out of further profits or come buy back at a higher cost. You could see it as both.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:44:22
Someone seems to have a hard time differentiating between 'Million' and 'billion'.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:56:57
The usual sarcastic reply. I didn't give a convincing answer since I don't have one. And the only reason I commented is because I was interested in knowing the answer too. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:43:26
Where exactly do you work ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:28:21
We have to pay tax and extra money in some exchanges. Not many just a few.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:12:43
What's an ETF?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:20:54
It has already hit 10k on coin market cap.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:35:10
Either way that's a huge load of money.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:21:36
How true is this ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:16:53
Damn I should've sold mine when it happened lol. Jk I'm a Hodler.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:40:32
The name was a giveaway. And I know a Varun who gave a TEDx talk in Bangalore. So I was wondering if you were the same guy.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:03:43
So everything else is pretty much the same as using normal BTC addresses? Just a different wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:31:28
What's the name of that exchange? Since the image seems to be cropped.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:25:55
And whose loss is that ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:50:05
What's ethereum cash? Or was it an inside joke?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:09:33
The fee is ridiculously high at the moment and you'd probably get a little over £10 after deducting the transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:44:46
Wanna know this too.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:15:12
Can you explain a bit more? I'm curious!
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:51:30
True as that might be , you still haven't answered his question.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:32:23
So difficulty is gonna reduce ? If so what does it mean to miners ? More profitable or less profitable?
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:59:56
What is CME?
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:43:18
Any Android wallets for segwit?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:20:54
Is there a countdown for the difficulty adjustment?
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:02:02
Considering how slow India implements any regulation it would take some time to even start doing something. And not many people are aware of cryptos in India it's still limited to tech savvy people.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:55:41
None of them are using the segwit address. So none of those blocks are even close to 2mb
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:07:28
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:20:24
Considering that all of your transactions are publicly accessible to everyone on the block chain I'm sure it's safe.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:27:13
Vertcoin is fast and can be used for everyday transactions. Then there is iota which has zero transaction fee and quick too. And litecoin itself is accepted fairly widely and is the Bitcoin that can be used as currency.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:08:16
Thanks a lot. Really helped.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:01:23
Bittrex is pretty good and has many alt(or shit) coins.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:15:27
I'd suggest you to wait out the storm and get in when the dust settles down. It's a shit show at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:21:23
I want to know the same things too.
