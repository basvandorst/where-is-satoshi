wow i had goosebumps XD
such a brave decision you've made.. how have you searched for places where to pay with btc? wasn't it difficult? for example, in Burma.
and what was your hardest challenge during the trip?

a bit off-top (or no)
if one can pay with crypto for porn ([Pornhub, for example]( are there any places to pay with crypto to a prostitute? where it is legalized, of course

Wow! Such an honor to give an expert opinion to the authorities! You are lucky person.
I can't advise you well on Finnish taxes, but you have to mention crypto mining in your letter. Finland is a good country for it - the electricity price is quite low, as well  as average temperature. And the legislation and fair taxes will make crypto mining in Finland very attractive.

check other options, i don't believe PayPal is a good idea here. also "a couple of bucks" won't help you much while BTC rate is more then $6700. but you can try and get acquainted with crypto. good luck.

well, all such news make me be nervous. taking over, merging, buying of exchanges by other exchanges. all these actions look like attempts for total regulation and centralization crypto.

i still can't understand how it is possible to ban decentralized and anonymous (more or less) crypto currency. who has entitled these people to ban it? Nakamoto?

though i can't advise you anything here, but it's quite strange that such a situations occur with different exchanges. recently there was another post about coinbase blocked a user's account. i think it could be either real examination of accounts or kind of scam actions.
anyway, i believe the best solution is to fight for your rights and to make this actions public.

that's the one i meant. also try to search reddit for such posts.
i will also think over some ways to help you.

Is it a surprise for someone that big companies, holdings, conglomerates, associations are more powerful in terms of getting benefits? of course, they even more interested in it and are ready to pay (or just work harder) to receive a patent. such a competition between big and small businesses will always be, disregarding their sphere.

why do you think so? one day it will recover. i believe till the end of the year

does she herself accept BTC? can't read her T-shirt

they say it's impossible to mine exactly 21 mln of btc. not only due to lost btc as it is stated in the article but mostly due to technical issues.
i read about it somewhere, can't remember now. but watch this [video](

i am sure, it is the same 1% holding both fiat and btc
