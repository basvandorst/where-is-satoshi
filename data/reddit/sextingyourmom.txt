A first generation neon sign is not going to "appreciate in value big time." just because it says Bitcoin.   I don't mean to take anything away from Cryptocables as they're beautiful signs and she does  great work, but these signs are nothing any other neon maker can't reproduce.  You can't just slap the word Bitcoin on something and say it's going to appreciate.

Great now you're creeping on my posts.  What's so funny about interviewing an Engineer?  Here's what's really funny.  
"Then why do you live in the US!? We're always going to be a nation with regulation. We like our buildings to be earthquake resistant and our bridges to be inspected and our roads to be up to code and at least some of our meat and food to be inspected. In my opinion many of our failures have been a LACK of strong enough regulation - the subprime mortgage crisis and the shitty inspection on the Deepwater Horizon. If you hate regulation so much why not go to Lagos, Nigeria or Mogadishu, Somali or other completely regulation-free cities/countries? I feel like libertarians like you just like to complain, but don't actually want to go live in regulation-free places."

There needs to be some clarification here.  This is Laser etching not laser engraving.  Etching is much more superficial.  Stainless steel can certainly withstand house fire temperatures, however the etching on the surface in most cases will not! I would not feel comfortable with my private keys/wallet in a fire knowing they were only etched.  If you're looking for long term cold storage you should be looking at engraving with a CNC machine.  Cheaper and better.
