Money doesn't equate to wisdom and Warren Buffett proved it this year. Fuck off.

Yea bro, it's all ending for BTC. Pack up your bags and leave. Watch out for the angry cheerleaders on this message board. They're the kind of people who can't take defeat (they put all the money their grandmother gave them into bitcoin and desperately need it to reach 100 gazillion dollars so they can buy everything they want)
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:08:37
Yea, to put things into perspective. Even on the most popular penny stocks, cashing out $1,000,000 is truly impossible. Go check out the market cap of OTC exchanges. It's actually a great comparison to make with BTC, you fuckwit.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:58:19
not hard at all. 1000 btc can be sold if need be. you can sell 100 btc every 6 minutes. Big deal, you spend an hour of your life cashing out $1,000,000. compare that with penny stocks, you could spend months trying to liquidate $300 because there's no bid. so shut the fuck up, you morons, you really don't know what the fuck you are talking about.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:37:48
No, no one does. Are you stupid? People are busy and have shit to do.

need money to buy money? me no understand. seems like the owners of this said "money" have the upper hand. again, what does Bitcoin accomplish? I'm asking you specifically, with your stupid mentality. observers are free to observe and ponder, but don't answer.

You got a 0 because that was a horrible paper, but it's not your fault that school is stupid. The teacher shouldn't be abusing you because they hate their life and their job. Sue the teacher and give that school a lesson their sorry asses deserve.

@_date: 2013-12-08 00:15:57
Good post. One thing you could have added was "don't expose your entire net worth or all the money you live on, to Bitcoin". It's just a psychological thing, you'll freak out more over every move.
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:51:57
plot twist: everyone who gets upvotes on reddit are faggots.

Ron Paul, the same loser who was dissing Bitcoin earlier. Man, this guy is a joke.

WellsFargo is definitely one of the top 3 reasons I loved Bitcoin so much. Thanks WellsFargo, for making traditional money so hard. You're getting what you deserve now, you little punks.

No, what will cause people to commit suicide is when this shit goes to $10 and they wished they sold when it were still around $500.

This switch serves no purpose other than to fuck with peoples heads. People have a hard enough time grasping the concept of Bitcoin as is. Then trusting it is another whole process.

"It took me just a few hours to be convinced, and 1 week later I had 3 months salary worth of BTC. " = you were always greedy
