I am not a troll but I do not currently have a convenient way to buy Bitcoin and I enjoy tipping. So if you tip me I will tip it out to someone else. :)
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:14:50
Yep, I see people here trollin already with their "free market bad" and "regulation stops this." I can't tell if they are really that dumb or incredibly naive.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:51:40
Seems suspicious.
@_date: 2014-12-26 02:51:02
Wow, what a scumbag. Hilarious that he would warn this user against "scammers" after doing that.
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:54:42
Wow, thanks. This is kind of astonishing!

Have you taken your medicine today? You seem to be hearing voices.

It seems like a hardfork that changes the rules everyone agreed to when they invested time/money would be far more devastating than any theoretical problems. OP glosses over that completely.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:07:47
Hey OP - it's been an hour. Still no TXID posted by you or mention of what client you were using. Several people here who are more knowledgeable than me have offered to help you. What gives?
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:09:55
I agree, I think it means more lower volume usage by more (probably newer) users like myself, and less high volume usage by the old guard.

Bitcoin adoption will grow as more options at different levels of responsibility are available. However, in this case, it's not a very relevant point, because Blockchain.info is a service specifically for people who want direct control. They cannot be responsible for people logging into phishing sites.
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:07:37
Haha, right?? I get the sneaking suspicion the OP has no idea how absurd his question sounds.

I am "newish". I tried to read about all the common objections and problems before asking. But I don't see the general answer to this: if the current transaction limit is approximately 7 per second, and the number of transactions starts maxing out every chunk, what is the consensus on how to fix this? Will there be a code change to raise the transaction cap? Or will Bitcoin stop being useful for microtransactions? Who will decide this?
@_date: 2014-08-25 16:25:39
Best way to make sure it's corrected is by less expensive alternatives competing with them.
@_date: 2014-11-15 19:39:07
Seriously, this was my first reaction. TIL my motorcycle jacket = bondage gear. :p
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:15:32
I read a while ago that there are tools in development to show if someone is trying to doublespend, so that you can assess risk on a 0-conf transaction. Does anyone know if they have been released?
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:48:12
The merchants always come out on the short end of the stick. In most of the agreements they eat the reversals and build it into their prices. There are some rare cases where merchants are covered for reversals but that is usually at an even higher fee structure.
The fact is, there are already brick-and-mortar vendors that DO accept Bitcoin with 0-confirmation transactions in places around the world.

It's pretty funny that you are acting like a feature that is amazing in some situations and safe to ignore when it's inconvenient is somehow bad. Are you serious?

Thanks! I'd tip you too but I am poor. :(

I subscribed today, although I've been reading for a little while. Why would a bot bother subscribing? Can't they do any upvoting or downvoting without being subscribed?
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:14:58
Thanks, I will. Last time I checked you couldn't trade it on any altcoin exchanges. There was some complicated procedure used to get Weexchange btc vouchers over the ripple wallet interface and then login to the exchange website and exchange them for BTC...I didn't understand it. ID verification required, I stopped reading there.

Hey remember me? Someone was nice enough to spread the love so here is thanks for yesterday:

You've obviously never bought a car before LOL. It takes way longer than an hour just to take care of the financing. If your payment to the dealer gets reversed, they come get their car back, regardless of what payment method you are using. It sounds to me like you are stretching a very weak argument (which has already been refuted) as much as humanly possible because you really don't care what people are trying to explain to you. So, have fun with that and feel free to never use bitcoin. :) :) :)
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:27:30
Thanks! Let me give this a shot:
all edit: 2nd shot :p

You mean you can bring cash in person to a bank who will give you an account balance for that cash. If you try to move that account balance to another person, it is not instant. It doesn't make sense to me to compare this process to making a payment.
@_date: 2014-11-08 23:22:08
My older brother bought Bitcoin one year ago. But since he's been buying a little at a time over the last two years he is way up overall. It doesn't really make sense to assume that everyone bought in at the peak. Most of the buying has happened at much lower prices.

I haven't used reddit enough to really understand the whole subscription thing. I thought it was a pay option at first. I just bookmarked So although I subscribed today I didn't just discover it today or anything.

Coinbase never asked me to do this.

I can't speak for everyone else, but I am not "holding" for more USD in the future. I am "holding" as both an endorsement of the system and a way to store value. I don't ever want USD back. I will spend when I want to spend, till then I will save, and I feel great knowing that the total supply is fixed, no government is devaluing it to pay for murdering kids with drones.

I am perfectly happy using Blockchain.info - you are free to use whoever you like. They have given me the tools I need to keep my btc safe and I have not been put at any additional risk.
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:24:09
Is there a place to trade XRP and BTC without ID verification?
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:02:14
When you said "unpopular opinion" I thought you were going to blame blockchain.info. From what I have read today, they are not at fault. Hopefully personal responsibility is a popular opinion here.

So who is the best bet for ASIC miners then?
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:55:53
Yep, I didn't mention this because the handful of banks that allow free person-to-person transactions between two accounts at the same bank absolutely exclude business accounts from doing this. And if you're caught using a personal account to accept payments this way for your business, your account will be closed with prejudice.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:32:15
Cool, so you're saying I didn't miss anything?
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:00:59
Something tells me the OP will totally ignore your request to sign a message.
Edit: Hah! While I was typing he replied and what a surprise! Completely ignored it!
