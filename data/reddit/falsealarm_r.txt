Great idea! A lot of the amateur and professional mixed martial arts fighters are also heavy investors in financial markets. And not only that they are also trendsetters. This would be a great use of hard earned BTC on something that is likely to have a high ROI! NOT!

The following statement "Americans will be left holding the bag on a valueless currency" begs the question "Isn't that what's happening with the US Dollar with the ever increasing trade and budget deficits, foreign owned US debt, the stagnant economy, etc.?". Can the US with a clever early implementation of cryptocurrencies not look to influence global markets in the long run and use it to its advantage rather than hand it over to another country to do so? If you have not noticed, the way things are going, we have but a few decades or less with the level of influence we have on other countries.

No, no. It will still be "breaking" but rather along the lines of "breaking the law", "breaking the bank", "breaking the rules of logic", "breaking my heart"... Yet still breaking something.

Well, all efforts are appreciated but if you are not holding a majority of your contribution margin in BTC and/or don't have any suppliers that accept BTC, in other words if almost all of your revenue turns immediately into fiat, you are not doing much good to BTC. You have to push to have your suppliers accept in BTC, and prefer to hold profits in BTC for this venture to be beneficial for the BTC economy.

PayPal should not be used a person to person money transmitting medium but rather a purchase payment gateway. What you pay with PayPal is the value added services and guarantees. Imagine purchasing a $2K TV online, paying for it with Bitcoins, receiving it damaged or not at all and asking for a refund. If it's not a major retailer, there is a significant risk of loss of money for the buyer. Use of PayPal in combination with a credit card basically reduces that risk to minimal. Now that you have a medium like Bitcoin though, you'd have to be an idiot to send money for the purpose of sending money directly to another person of any technical capacity. Just don't buy anything with it on eBay from non-business registered entities yet.

I suggest you check the last paragraph where it also says "I conclude with one provison: it can be very effective to give out small amounts of bitcoins just to help accustom people to having them. However, the reason this is effective is that it helps spread avarice around.".

Agreed, he has the absolute perfect target audience with the most amount of disposable cash. I am sure he is raking it in. I would not discredit his demographic's use of Bitcoin though. If cryptocurrencies are going to get anywhere, it's their generation who will make the biggest difference.
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:57:14
No, I agree. This is not the job for single man operation. It takes a team of seasoned developers, and a team of seasoned functional analysts who understand all of those mandates. Even if there is no government regulation, in order to be successful you have to self impose them. Otherwise you're developing another MtGox.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:54:24
This somber yet resilient tone of these cryptocurrency celebrities is starting to piss me off. It sounds completely manufactured to the point I am seriously suspecting these are lame attempts at manipulating the price further. Shrem states "all will be fine", Vorhees "declares all is lost", yet when it comes to disclosing the cold hard facts behind these statements, no one coughs up anything "factual".
@_date: 2014-04-12 04:56:16
We need to get these crooks out of the cryptocurrency business and need to go do without having to resort to strict government regulation. It takes one dishonest greedy individual like this to discredit the positive that one hundred other businesses do for cryptocurrency market. Had it not been for these now frequent scandals, I think we would have seen more significant gains over the last year.

Possible scenario.
1. Karpeles comes to control nearly 800K bitcoins,
2. MtGox operates on fractional reserves,
3. MtGox possibly suffers a small loss of funds due transaction malleability attack or unknown vulnerability, or Karpeles develops criminal intent,
4. Karpeles is aware or becomes  aware of the impact of his exchange's outages on the global bitcoin market, his expectation is long term resilience however a short term major drop,
5. Karpeles decides to "short" on bitcoin for fraudulent gain,
6. Karpeles sets up sockpuppet accounts for funneling of funds through either transaction malleability or regular transactions after price drop (in cooperation with a group similar to BitcoinBuilder),
7. Karpeles initiates a trend of slow transactions with MtGox,
8. Karpeles sabotages MtGox while disseminating various false stories,
9. While bitcoins are either syphoned over time using malleability to other accounts, or fresh outages provide opportunity for previously setup accounts to buy coins outright for much less than worth,
10. Market is further manipulated with false news while the period of outages and no-news is maximized for further buy opportunities,
11. Karpeles looks for a buy-out investor, or someone to inject coins for partnership share in MtGox,
11. Karpeles is unable to find such idiot and applies for bankruptcy protection,
12. A healthy fraction of the coins disappear only to magically reappear when Karpeles is out of jail or the news is long forgotten.

Well, I completely understand the dilemma and the need to act, however am troubled by the final decision to resign. There is no other group that can immediately replace the foundation thus it will have to remain for a while. Considering that, why would anyone resign? Wouldn't that further reduce the number of those who emulate high moral values within the organization? You should stayed to fight on.

Apparently, you have not heard of the prohibition era :) From a legal standpoint, they can ban it as they can ban porn and/or torrent based P2P networks. This would not mean they can physically stop you from participating in it yet it would put a significant amount of stress on the value of BTC since no one other than the common public would be able to do so. Banks and all other financial entities would be barred from transacting with it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:11:55
I hate to be use a cliche but this smells like either an "inside job" from the get-go or something that was cooked up after a small time compromise. Either way, Karpeles is in possession of a majority of the coins, has been testing the waters with various excuses gauging for a way out with the least severe punishment and most amount of coins.

I think you are forgetting the fact that BTC was popular in China due to its potential as a means to get money out of country. If you can't get fiat out, how are you going to invest outside of China in BTC without fiat as a Chinese investor. Those who can get their money out easily currently do not need to invest in BTC to do so. They have other means to do so without the volatility involved.

If another cryptocurrency celebrity comes out to comment on this piece of no-value-update, and claim rain or shine without any factual evidence, we can maintain the trend of the last few days.

I love the real world fiat based transaction example he has given us with "nightclub singer to buy bread from a baker who gets his music from iTunes". We are apparently an economy where when you want to pull a sample transaction out of your a$$ a nightclub singer and a baker are the two people who come to mind.
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:14:01
Please consider holding profits, if not majority of contribution margins, in BTC rather than exchanging everything to fiat immediately. Please also push your suppliers to consider accepting BTC for payments. I said this before and will say it again. Converting all revenue to fiat immediately will not help develop the Bitcoin economy further but rather depress pricing.

I beg to differ on that "100% safe government securities" statement. If and when US defaults on its debt, it's not only limited to China :)

Short term, no worries. She is probably in over her head with what she needs to follow/monitor, ingest, and act upon. Long term, not necessarily a candidate for my business if she maintains that state of cluelessness.

Good luck finding many merchants who will work with your theoretical instantly secure transactions! If you make a lot of assumptions with the theoretical basics, your credit card was also secure "enough" even without CVVCs, integrated chips, and pictures, etc. Look at the amount of fraud there.

I desperately looked for the sarcasm indicator at the end of that statement, probably three times over. Sadly, it was no where to be found. I shall not even bother to see if your other posts make any sense on any topic whatsoever but this one sets the bottom threshold.

We seriously need more business savvy folks speaking for the cryptocurrencies than these "technical" celebrities, especially in these times of distress. These people either like to be sensational in hopes of lining up a bunch of interviews with mass media, or have interest in manipulating the market. You need to be able to craft your words while on your feet, and speak to the long term interest of the market/technology. A lot of below here congratulate Voorhees for a nice interview but if you listen to it from an investor's perspective, general public or investment firm, all that past tense talk does not convey a positive outlook though nothing on this MtGox deal is certain yet.
@_date: 2014-03-17 05:28:23
The only way BTC can reach any higher than the $1200 ceiling it did in the past is with an exponential surge in utilization and transaction volume. Considering most are hoarding, including the 10% of BTC multimillionairres who hold 90% of the coins out there, reaching number like $10K is a pipe dream. Get RinkledAss brothers and the like to spend (not cash out) their coins and there is your dream uptick.

What's politics if it's not perverse :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 04:32:08
I think another way to promote flow of fiat into BTC at this juncture would be to persistently offer decent discounts to BTC transactions. If you are saving 2.9% compared to credit card transactions, you should at least double that. Return what's saved on card fees, and on top what you save from fraudulent activities, charge backs, etc. Make people go out to turn their fiat into BTC and the rest will develop on its own.
This is obviously if you can afford to offer these type of BTC promotions. If you market place is so saturated that you're on a very thin margin, there would not be much to do to.

Having spent 15 years in end-to-end SDLC of Financial/Acquisitions/Asset Management systems for the Federal Government, here is where I think the general problem is with these exchange development efforts. You have compartmentalized people developing, deploying, and maintaining these exchanges. People who develop simpler web applications (using PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.) cannot be expected to develop a "fully" functional exchange, let alone manage it from a business perspective once in O&amp;M phase. 
You can't cofound Reddit today, and develop and run an exchange handling a billion dollars tomorrow. The effort needs people with enterprise application development experience who understand multiple frameworks, financial transactions, PII, access models, authentication and authorization mechanisms, audit and accounting processes, and a ton of other technical and functional aspects of developing such an application. This is a small subset of skills in addition to what I observe most Bitcoin related businesses lack in general including proper change, configuration, release management processes.  
I participated in a pool that generated in excess of 250BTC per day at one time, and the only developer and administrator did not even have the necessary skills to optimize a database because he used to develop for an entirely different industry prior where an understanding of RDBMS, SQL, NoSQL, or anything similar experience was needed. I can't begin to image how the rest of the solution was put together and what vulnerabilities may exist.

Are the social media account deletions the good news you were alluding to? How about the continued silence? On a different note, you seem to ask the trolls accosting you "What have I done to you?" with the emphasis on "you". Though I hate the trolls, I agree with the fact that you have done a great disservice to the community, indirectly, with the dark stain on its reputation you left behind. Also, open up the charts from the day you got arrested, you may be responsible for one of those mini dips.
