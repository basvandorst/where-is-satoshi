The decentralized nature ensures it is not controlled by any one entity. You can encrypt email on regular services or rent your own server, manage it yourself, but in each and every one of those cases, your account is controlled by someone, if not the owner of the system, then the government in which the system is located in. Blockchain seems to at least address this, by ensuring no one entity can hand over access to the system, as it is distributed. Sure you can encrypt, but you still cannot be sure what kind of setup your email is running on that might compromise your information (i.e. Gmail). 
I see value in completely stripping away any company or government this control. Regardless, it seems there are already services out there offering this, so someone has thought it's at least worth a try.

Also this could be part of a new decentralized (or close to) network like ZeroNet, thus creating a new economy for websites. I'm too dumb for any this however. I'll go back to the benches now.

Can you elaborate on this? Is this because of security reasons, or privacy reasons, or...?
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:14:23
So there's no way to have a public address of sorts like an email address because it defeats the purpose? Does this mean that cryptamail just has a mapping of blockchain addresses to email addresses, even thought your content is encrypted in the blockchain?

You don't control it if you run your own servers. First, running your own physical servers is inconvenient, so the real practical solution is to use a hosting server, whether it's private, shared or whatever. In either case, you are bound the local laws, and in the latter you are at the mercy of the company that is providing the service.
I see the point however, a blockchain isn't necessarily harder to break into or compromise. The only benefit I see is that your account cannot be taken down or blocked. 
I think I'm seeing value in having the guarantee no single agent can censor or block you. Your account will always be usable via the blockchain, even though you risk similar things than if you have a regular email (breaking encryption), minus the location of the data.

To be fair not many get the decentralized/centralized concepts in general, let a lone in networks and information. The state as a concept is already a centralized point of authority, and for many centuries countries have been running with centralized models, but now we have a real decentralized revolution. This is why people don't get anonymity, since they're so used to having a state issued ID, getting watched by the gov., being on the grid etc. Perhaps that was the only way to have any kind of civilization up until now, when information networks are advanced enough to support algorithms for decentralized institutions.

I can see that back in the days of the founding fathers. Many of them were progressive thinkers, I think especially Franklin. Their government for the people, by the people, sounds like a decentralized idea, but it's only a centralized power that makes it hard to attain too much power. What you mention is the breaking of this barrier, so that now we see a police state and most of the power being at the federal level since the early 20th century.

Yeah, but money has always been backed by some central authority. Think Roman coins, backed by the Roman emperor. Trust has always been an issue among groups of humans, and up until now I think there was just no way to not centralize trust. You always needed some military or some kind of authority that acts as the third party source of trust between the transaction of two people. Now that's going to become just an algorithm.

I see Git/SVN as a great example of Bitcoin/traditional money. There's a lot of overlap between them, and you can even use Git as a centralized repo, which adds to the confusion.

I think it's because he's probably not really embracing bitcoin as he is repeating his usual positions regarding the fed reserve. I think the real political bump will come about form someone who sees potential in it.

I see, sounds reasonable. It's like what the police do where they go to people's houses and ask for the house keys so that they can prevent thefts by keeping track of everything you own. We don't want to get robbed, *do we?!*

Money is debt? If someone could explain this that would great. This sounds like an oversimplified explanation that favors a capitalistic viewpoint.

@_date: 2014-04-03 18:44:25
Thanks! I think I understand this, but could this concept be explained without banks? Is this concept that money is debt dependent on banks and/or has has the modern concept of money arisen with the creation of banks?

Seems a little redundant that would only be useful in a future when people can physically morph into other people. Then you would ask for some form of crypto verification identity, to make sure you are talking to the right person. Otherwise, the whole point of a crypto currency is that the authorization and verification are built-in, right?

"And... *why* did you buy a computer?"
Lol. This is funny because people 30 years ago couldn't fathom a technological breakthrough such as the PC + Internet. There isn't anything you could ask that question about with such innocence, because we're now used to tech breakthroughs happening more often. Of course, we wouldn't see it coming.  The only thing that comes close is VR, I can see people asking, "*why* did you buy a VR headset?", and 20 years from now, nobody in the right mind will bother using anything else for navigating online and working.

I don't think it works that way... maybe Japan will lead the way, but they don't have control over it (or they shouldn't if they're planning on it), therefore people will decide easily where to take their coin.

No government or party has to do anything really, just let it happen. That's the whole idea, it's decentralized, nobody controls it. Anyway, how come you have a throwaway account, aren't you a representative?
