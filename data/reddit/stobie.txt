Even if GST is not only charged on the commission, whenever you buy something and pay GST and then sell it, you can claim all of the GST back. This means it would never be enforced on an exchange because it's just a waste of time.

Bitcoin doesn't have more technical merit than the alts, most of them use the bitcoin code with a few constants changed.

We have not witnessed any relevant bitcoin deflation yet. Bitcoin is called deflationary because eventually all bitcoins which will ever be will already exist in the present. At the moment more bitcoins are released relative to the total than any fiat currency is printed relative to it's total. No part of bitcoins history can be used to debate this topic, you're going to have to wait a hundred years before the deflationary topic can be debated emperically. The recent rise in value is due to wider adoption, not the relevant issue of its inherant deflationary quality due to the fact that one day mining will cease. Even then it's not really deflationary, it would only seem to be since dollars will continue to inflate.

You could point out they lose 3% of every sale they make where a credit card is involved, with bitcoin that would drop to almost zero.
