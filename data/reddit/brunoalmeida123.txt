It is only a matter of time boyz. ETF is not needed in the sense of crypto adoption which is happening. But what it will allow in is a lot more money and investments into the crypto space boosting the market and prices
@_date: 2019-02-03 15:36:38
Government know they cant stop crypto so they might as well collect it :)
@_date: 2019-02-03 15:35:57
Real really good drawing well done to who ever done this and hodl to the end ;)

What is this guy on lol 
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:26:27
LOL, where about's is that. That restaurant deserves our respect

Bitcoin is digital gold its more of a store of value however with the lightning network this may change and it may be both a fast scaleable digital currency and a store of value at the same time making Bitcoin possibly the most highest valued asset to be created. But only time will tell.

More corruption = more need for crypto/bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:06:08
The graph is correct in one way relating to bitcoin however its not accounting for many things such as large scale institutions using bitcoin and crypto in general, mass adoption and much more. This is basically working of the halving of bitcoin which each time there is more people getting in is going to affect the price less and less 
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:52:51
Funny how so many copy bitcoin dont make really any changes and expect to be the new bitcoin. The true king of crypto will always beat any random forked coin.
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:44:32
Looks pretty sick :)
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:52:19
It will create more interest and awareness in crypto which will create more adoption :)
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:07:08
Bitcoin lightning network will really make a difference 
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:42:12
Centralized exchanges are okay if actually with companies that go for security over making a quick buck. However there is a lot of decentralized exchanges out there that are not truly decentralized you are only swapping your real coins for token versions of your coins to trade on the platform and you have the private keys for the fake trading coins which on withdraw are changed back and your real coins sent.
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:54:15
They done it before as well.
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:21:08
Russian banks mostly and goldman sacs already does
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:36:37
Adoption is starting with many countries starting to take on crypto
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:55:03
Bitcoin etf should already be passed before Q2 anyways lol
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:42:54
Most of these website require cookies to actually function. The websites you linked with no cookies have no need for  cookies to function apart from if they wanted to track. But site like coinbase requires them and bitpay. Dont get why [bitcoin.com]( need them though lol
@_date: 2019-01-03 23:34:33
fee is a bit high 
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:10:38
Because crypto is the future and people know its going to be very big in the future. Best investment of our life time and must be stupid to lose out.
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:53:18
Slowly but getting there, one bitcoin starts hitting mainstream Crypto ATMS will be poping up all over the place
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:03:59
The hack was due to the ETH fork, that why no other coins were taken and only ETH and ERC-20 tokens.
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:40:53
Keep up the good work if every person in btc got 1 new person into btc and then that person got 1 person into btc we would get adoption flying in no time.
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:24:37
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:59:28
Banks slowly losing interest and people preferring more online/digital means of banking. This is why decentralization and security via crypto is ever more needed to ensure full security .
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:55:32
Bitcoin would never fall to zero as there would always be someone trading it for something. However it could fall to a low value that would ruin a lot of people but chances of that happen are 1 in a million falling that low.
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:12:44
I wonder what another 10 years for bitcoin will be like 
@_date: 2019-01-03 23:07:46
Looks way cool
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:09:55
When bakkt launched for a bit we should hopefully see some market movement 
@_date: 2019-01-14 02:10:18
Best trade for you since in a few years that trade will be worth atleast 50x more
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:10:51
2029 he owns the world ;)
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:02:53
The only people calling btc or crypto risky are those that it will end up destroying and they want to FUD as much as possible. Lottery is one of the largest risks/scams of them all and they should be forced to use blockchain tech to run a lottery for full accountability to ensure a fair lottery however they wont do it that quick until forced as its currently easy to manipulate the lottery and they like it that way.
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:02:42
It already is just not advertised that well
@_date: 2019-01-10 13:45:54
I would not believe anything that comes from random news websites that only post articles that pay. Best actually have the official information before listening to these fuders
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:56:13
I dont see any similarity apart from a few lines magically drawn by someone with no idea in graph analysis 
@_date: 2019-01-04 00:57:15
Scaling for the win
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:51:42
Crypto will be the future it just takes time and everyone currently getting in will be very much happy with their investments in the future.
@_date: 2019-01-22 12:19:31
Adoption happening and growing each day
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:43:43
One step at a time is good now we just need more adoption to happen 
@_date: 2019-01-22 12:28:11
I think we all wish that but if bitcoin went 10 million a coin then I would if 1 million would equal todays 1000
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:53:13
The bear market is around the -80% movements but the bull movement are 1900% - 12,000% 
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:11:20
I mean in the price going up has nothing to do with adoption. The lower the price gets the more chance it gives to accelerate adoption. However people seem to take it if bitcoin is not going up in price then its not being adopted which is totally the opposite of the truth
@_date: 2019-01-22 12:21:00
You cant predict a price however only guess that still usually never happens as its to low or to high
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:00:40
Banks seem to do what they want when they want and nothing you can really do about it. Its why crypto will change the world to be decentralized and honest forced with blockchain as there is to much corruption.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:39:45
Adoption is happening and next bull run will be the biggest yet
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:45:00
I wonder how it was solved
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:09:07
They will come in time ;)
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:06:44
Dont worry there wont be any USD within the next 15 years
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:53:46
It would be big if they done it however not official so no point getting hopes up yet.
@_date: 2019-01-22 12:17:53
Think il take the unircorn for now and sell it to buy more btc at this bottom :)
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:08:39
Bitcoin only needs to change from POW to POS to become green. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:12:17
Seems someone lacks knowledge about Portugal since it holds some of the most gold reserves in Europe and more advanced then most EU countries in tech ;)
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:59:02
The SEC is just a institution looking to profit on fining companies. Blockchain is the only current real solution against hacks however it will put thousands of business out of business within the next few years if they dont start to change to using blockchain tech.
@_date: 2019-01-30 14:05:29
Thats a lesson for everyone dont buy crypto and sell it the next day xD
@_date: 2019-01-30 14:07:07
The market sentiment does not seem to really care about news at the moment so I doubt any announcement is going to do much look at the ETF. However on actually being launched that sentiment may change hopefully.
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:51:22
As if google search trends has anything to do with interest in buying dollar or bitcoin. Its basically small % of people hardly anything so yeah in the people searching maybe bitcoin wins but those not which would be the large amount are probably still for USD. I would not really look at any like that as it provides no information really apart from false statistics.
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:48:48
Price dip has nothing to do with adoption. 2018 had massive amount of adoption and in 2019 we will see more. The current cycle is just the average trading cycle like stocks.
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:47:46
Adoption takes time however 2020 to 2022 will be when mass adoption will begin. Currently we are in the early stages still with large companies/institutes getting in and starting to put in place regulations shortly after we will see mass adoption once these have got their hands in crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:56:40
This ETF most likely will be accepted mainly from main stream adoption from large companies, government starting to accept it and the US does not want to be behind all other countries 
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:06:44
Its why crypto is needed to solve inflation but also dishonesty with governments and centralized institutions 
@_date: 2019-01-30 14:02:14
There is always a delay with these platforms. They aim march but really add 2-3 months on top and you got the real date.
@_date: 2019-01-22 12:28:43
Bitcoin will fund the government xD
@_date: 2019-01-14 02:12:47
Totally agree. The current market is just a normal market cycle like stocks and 2017 bull run will be put to shame with the pull run to come over the next 5-8 years
@_date: 2019-01-14 02:11:22
I doubt its the end to blockchain since quantum computer function totally different. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:07:59
You ever noticed that these companies and countries FUD bitcoin calling it a scam and a waste of time and then months later when its dropped they are buying in. The market is highly manipulated by these big players.
