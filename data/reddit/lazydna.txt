Quite frankly the  newest posts around my time of post were exceedingly mean spirited, insults were thrown and accusations. If not mean spirited, then what?
And notice I said 'some' not all.
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:37:09
you don't. you have to give them the benefit of the doubt unless you have evidence to suggest otherwise.
this is a problem with unregulated exchanges that bitcoin will have to deal with or at least attempt to mitigate.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:47:14
nice, you got downvoted for pointing out facts.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:43:12
he didn't even say anything bad about anything and he's a troll?
alright i'm outs. i've had enough of this place.

problem becomes the very fact, all cryptos are worthless as bonds and stocks because bonds and stocks represent investment in companies/countries.
putting currencies into investments means you are directly encouraging the growth of companies.
treating cryptos as a investment accomplishes nothing.

Yeah i understand that no community can be held accountable by the actions of a few. Bitcoin is a large community but man, the amount of hostility is pretty shocking.
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:18:22
Nobody pushed anything onto you. Op only asked how bitcoin can be more newbie friendly and polite to those interested in crypto, like doge.
The op was not endorsing doge, he was merely using t as an example. So stop with the persecution complex.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:31:40
filter by newest post, not top. ugh, it's kind of gross.

Is china really going to loosen there currency controls for no political gain or financial gain?
It would take one hell of a bribe to completely alter China's policy on the outflow of the yuan.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:47:50
yes, but lets be honest here.
can you imagine dogecoin being worth 10TRILLION in 20 years?
let's not put the cart before the horse.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:46:07
a difference of 0.5% by 2020.
the point is, both currencies have inflation because of minting.
you might rag on doge because monetary inflation is endless, but the fact of the matter is, over time, the inflation is so small, it will only recoup the loss coins that are removed from circulation and put ever so slight pressure on people to spend and not hoard. it's a currency, not a long term storage of wealth.

At first, I filtered from top comment, not too shabby, mostly positive things on how to move bitcoin forward and be more accepting.
then I filtered from newest. And holy shit you got some really mean spirited people in your subreddit.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:41:50
yes by the time bitcoin becomes truly deflationary, 2140, dogecoin will have a whopping 0.68% inflation a year. break out the champagne guys, we're just PRINTING the money here with that amount of monetary inflation.
meanwhile, by next year, doge will have 5% monetary inflation a year against bitcoins 11.94%.
so who is really printing money?
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:51:38
Still not convinced the Chinese are willing to loosen their grip on currency controls.
Going to be cautiously optimistic but I'll sit on the side lines for now.

Pot kettle black stability much lulz
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:45:33
I see accusations but very little proof.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:56:22
yes and eventually the gap will close because the total supply is high relative to the inflation, we get it.
but it's not hyper inflation. it's not 'printing money'
this is a decided, consistent, hopefully unchangeable trajectory that we've chosen.
if bitcoin is going to the deflationary method, that's great, we're taking a path not traveled and try a slight bit of inflation to reduce hoarding and encourage circulation.

See that's the beauty of doge.
It functions the same way as bitcoin.
Everything bitcoin has in terms of services is because of popularity, acceptance is a foundation of currency.
There is no legitimate or illegitimate. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:50:44
nobody said you couldn't make money in ripple.
as long as your in on the scam.
that's what googles betting on.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:56:18
You say this as if doge and bitcoin are so different.
As I said before.
Different block times and algorithm do not inhibit each from doing their job.
If you call one Monopoly money, it applies to both. 
Reflect and think, your using the same arguments as someone would against crypto 3 years ago.
Perspective man.
+100 doge

Because there just might be a chance he will reflect on it and realize that we come in peace. 
It's a peace offering.

Merry christmas

No premine on doge, check the doge chain and the ann on bitcoin talk.
100billon or 21million. The number doesn't matter, it's the valuation.
Block times make difference. Though doge is slightly better as it adapts faster to changes in network hash.
But the draw back is more orphans. Forgot to add.
But a necessary evil these days since a high difficulty over prolong days can kill a crypto due to multi pools.

Yes there are differences, but functionally, they are the same. They have the same purpose and perform the same job. Popularity and adoption can attract more services and improvements, just like bitcoin.
Woah no need to get so defensive. 
I can see you really can't get pass the idea of a competitor.
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:42:49
Oh okay. If you say so man.
I have personally yet to see a bitcoin bashing thread in the front page of dogecoin. They're usually just pictures and jokes. But if you can't see that and have very different vibes. Meh.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:23:39
+100 doge
You are what is wrong with the bitcoin community.
You try and tear down everything with negativity.
How will you ever attract new people to your cause if your attitude is so poor?
We come in peace.
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:05:58
this is because Chinese exchanges are allowing deposits again against PBOC rules.
come jan 31 we will see if China allows them to defy their orders.
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:26:33
Only focusing on the value of dogecoin is not the point.
I gave him 100 because it's a peace offering. It costs nothing but time and interest. Maybe it will spark something in him?

Are you implying that an illegitimate MP3 player exists?
Ooooookay
