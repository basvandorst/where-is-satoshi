Ok, but I've never had any issues with Coinbase's customer support, or getting a ticket resolved. (Hint: you actually have to get them on the phone; that's the best way to get quick results.)  
Anyway, since my experiences have all been positive with them, does that mean I'm not allowed to use Coinbase anymore either, OP? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:28:44
Tried it. No luck. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:10:26
I could, but there aren't any other details to provide: I try to open the app, and almost immediately see the Samsung boot animation as it restarts.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:11:19
Yeah, that's what I figured on the 1st part...
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:10:06
And on a grand scale, my brother...it was like an F5 tornado wiping away everything in its path. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:12:14
That's actually worked for some people, though.  
That's a big part of what's driving this whole thing.  
If it took a rocket science degree to get into it, it wouldn't be nearly as popular.

What was your average hold time on their phone support system?   
I've had to make 3 calls, and they were 40, 60, and about 80 minutes, respectively.   
(If you're prepared for that going in, it doesn't sting so much.)   
Once I *got* to an agent, they had me helped out and on my way within 10 minutes, each time.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:09:40


Maybe because on a level you don't want to face, Becky's right?  
I mean, I watched a bunch of my investments drop 30% today, too, but I'm not gonna start acting like those type of people didn't call it (in their way of seeing things.)  
Let them have their little fun; you're still up in the long run, probably, huh?
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:17:03
And everyone else thought I was crazy.  
What are my options?  
Opening another account at Chase or something, and just hope the same thing doesn't happen?  
(Plus, I'd really like to have access to the USD I actually have in my Coinbase account: they won't let me do anything with it...
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:45:26
Except for withdrawals working anymore.

Coinbase and GDAX are the same company. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:00:43
There wasn't a field to input a code when I signed up.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:02:52
I probably wouldn't even scramble it: I'd just put it into the middle of an email from "Aunt Sally" or something. (In fact, I'm going to go ahead and do that with my wallets' info right now.)
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:38:43
One of the easiest markets to make quick money, too.  
Almost all of the altcoins just follow what BTC is doing. Bitcoin goes up, everything else quickly follows, and vice-versa.   
Daytraders are making very consistent money following just that rule. 
Just compare the charts of everything else 30 minutes after BTC moves; you'll see what I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:55:54
Wow. That signup and verification process was about 100X faster and easier than Coinbase's.

See, to me, "having to type it" doesn't justify spending $80 on a piece of hardware I could lose *way* more easily than a message hidden in a gmail I sent to myself that would *always* be recoverable.  
(And I still could just copy/paste it in the end, so the typing wouldn't even be an issue.)
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:06:22
Lol, I just noticed that pretty much the only crypto showing a gain today is the regulator, USDTether. Go grab that free 3% if you use USDT to take a breather from trading from time to time!
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:55:19
There's no telling how many BTC have already been mined, but just lost over the years. Back when they were near worthless, I'd get one or two as part of a tip at a restaurant I worked at; those ended up in the trash, for instance. I'm sure there are many, many similar stories.  
So, I don't think a countdown clock would necessarily be effective.

That's exactly how my marriage went...
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:24:55
In the US, is,there a big list of alternatives?  
I know of a couple,  but not many by any stretch.    
(Coinmama I won't count, since they've been "verifying my documents" for well over a month, now.)  
There are a couple that aren't accepting new users as well.  
What's left?   
(I also don't count BTC ATMs, since while there are plenty of them, their fees are way too high, especially with a larger volume buy.)
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:57:43
Does it allow you to buy and transfer BTC with no fees?  
Now *that* would be incredible.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:30:06
I actually just spoke with a real person at Coinbase (after an hour on hold), and she told me that I needed to go to my local BoA branch and have Coinbase "whitelisted" for my account, because sometimes BoA will have them (or other entities they're not familiar with me using) blacklisted by default "for my protection."  
She also said that she was creating a ticket and an e-mail chain to get my Coinbase account re-enabled.  
I guess that's the next thing I can do; that, and just wait, I mean. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:10:45
Banks don't always "publicly announce" policy changes. When Compass Bank began disallowing fund transfers to online gambling/poker/casino sites, they didn't hold a press conference about it; they just quit doing it. And you were simply SOL if you had money from your Compass account tied into one of those offshore casino sites. 
FWIW, I'm done trying to justify this thread. It happened exactly as I described; as far as the information I simply passed along, you're welcome to take it or leave it.  
I was just trying to warn people who might use BoA and want to know.  
Merry Christmas. 
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:02:19
An 80% "correction" is tough to understand for most people.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:20:22
This is fake, but there are people out there who did this very thing (probably with bigger numbers).  
Why isn't it in the news?  
 
Because *that guy*'s never telling a *soul* about what he did. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:38:37
Personal, and it was my Mastercard debit card from BoA. I used the same card to buy the BTC in the first place.   
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:06:52
Lol. No it wouldn't. 
It wasn't in the news when US banks stopped allowing payments to and from online casinos, and that's a lot bigger industry than "Coinbase."
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:10:16
Look, man: I talked to a *telephone, customer service rep*. (I'm assuming that's not anywhere near the highest gig on the totem pole at a national bank.)  
She told me she'd just noticed the email. Idk how many emails and memos come down the pipe at BoA, but I'd bet it's so many that someone in customer service ignores half or them, and reads the other half when they're good and ready. 
There's not one thing I typed in this post that didn't happen as described. You can believe it or not, or you can call BoA's customer service line at 1-800-432-1000 if you want to just ask them.  
I don't care anymore.   
I *did* care when I posted it, because I thought it would be pertinent information for some people, but so many others in this thread are calling me a "liar" for no reason (and *why in the world* would I lie about this?), that y'all can just go kick rocks for all I care now.  
Merry Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:57:47
Idk. I'm kind of trying to avoid having to open an account at another bank, solely for the reason of retrieving $173.

@_date: 2017-12-24 18:24:31
Yes it was. I can't get my money *out* of Coinbase, and *back into* my bank account. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:40:25

The only "odd transactions" I've used that card for was buying a couple hundred bucks of BTC from Coinbase, wanting to ultimately convert it into Ripple. Ripple wasn't listed that day on Changelly, so I just reversed everything. I converted the money (which had dipped to $173, unfortunately) back into USD, and then sent another order to transfer it back into my bank account, which Coinbase confirmed via email: 
It's been "pending" since the 20th, even though I got an email from Coinbase that said it would be processed by yesterday, the 23rd. I called BoA yesterday to check on it, and that's when I was told about this policy change, and that I wouldn't be getting my money (through BoA, anyway.)
 
Coinbase (which I've found complete respect for as a company) has been totally on top of the situation without me having to lift a finger: they've sent me a few emails explaining how they're *trying* to get it back to me, but if it isn't resolved by the 28th, the transaction will be canceled. (I'm going to get on the phone with them right after Christmas; I'm sure they'll figure out a way to get me my $, even if it comes down to having to wait on a physical check.)     
@_date: 2018-09-06 03:44:36
Which alt do you think will have the highest % recovery, when it's all said and done? 
It was Nano at the top a few weeks ago, but I don't see it repeating itself. And Holo was probably a better option than Tether, tbh, but I only thought of that late and put less than a grand into Holo. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:23:16
Appropriate username.
  
(And like I said, just call BoA's customer service  if you need to hear it from them.)

Oooh, I don't care for the second part of your prediction. 
(I *think* we're past all that, though of course there will be corrections in the future, I think they'll all stay within the	7K-8K range.) 
But that's exactly what I was asking for in the OP: other people's opinions, and I fully respect yours, even though I don't agree with part of it.

The woman I spoke with was opening the company-wide email as I spoke with her today. 
I was transferring a small amount of cash back into my checking account. I got a couple of emails from Coinbase that basically said 'for some reason, your bank is rejecting the credit: you need to get in touch with your bank." 
Literally while I was on a call to a BOA representative, she said "hold on a second: I just noticed an email with Coinbase in the subject line...give me a second to see what's going on." 
A couple of minutes later, she came back to the line and told me that as of yesterday, BoA won't accept payment from or to Coinbase and other cryptocurrencies. She recommended emailing them to see if I could have a physical check mailed to me, and she also mentioned that if you use only your account number and routing number, you shouldn't have any problem getting money *from* Coinbase, because the merchant isn't listed in those transactions. She actually called it a loophole I might be able to use. 
I'm not making this up, and I just happened to to be extracting money *before* the dip; I filed it on the 20th, and it's only a few hundred dollars. 
I have absolutely *no reason* to make this up.  
Call them if you don't believe me.  
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:30:28

@_date: 2017-12-24 17:41:26
Reminded me of exactly the same thing. The banks didn't come out and advertise that their policies were changing over it: they just stopped allowing it. Ultimately, I had to get a physical check sent to me that took like a month to get. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:16:57
With your bank account number and routing number, or a credit /debit card? If it was the latter, try to pull even a dollar back onto your card.

Sorry, I misread it: fixed. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:22:16
Sure, but there are *plenty* of alts that aren't only legit, but are also improvements over Bitcoin itself, in many ways, and will be around no matter what Bitcoin does. 
Those are the only alts I'm interested in, and the only ones I really invest in. 
Btw, I'm finally done trading for the night: it took about 8 hours, but with a combination of Tether, Holo, and tradijng Bitcoin's greens and reds, my main alt that I'm invested in now has a almost 10% bigger stack, and I've also profited a fifth of a Bitcoin besides that. (No telling what that'll be worth tomorrow, though.)   
The charts look like there'll be one more dip before any more real upward movement, but that's TA, so who really knows? 
All I know is that I'm exhausted, but I managed to get through this whole thing in the green, but was very lucky to do so. 
Anyway, good night and good luck to you also.

I was able to buy exactly what I wanted on Coinbase. The buying wasn't the problem.  
The selling wasn't the problem.  
The *only* problem arose when I requested that the USD in my Coinbase account be put back into my BoA account.  
Coinbase basically said "Sure!"  
Bank of America basically said "Nope!"

I said "I don't care *for* it," like someone would say that they  "don't *care* for Brussels sprouts." 
That doesn't mean that they don't care *about* Brussels sprouts; only that they 'don't like the taste of them.'

If by "proving a guess" you actually mean "reasons why I made the guess," I guess it was based on what I already mentioned.  
Recently, when Bitcoin's price has *barely* varied during a one-to-two day period (around 1%), there's been heavy volatility directly after.
 
The small correction yesterday down to 7225 fooled me into thinking that was all the correcting it was going to have before it pumped UP, but obviously I was wrong about the direction it was going. 
The price increase guess I based on a similar increase from $6900-$7100 on August 23rd.  
That's it.  
That's everything that went through my brain before I posted this. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:33:15

No, I bought $200 worth of BTC, but changed my mind because I couldn't see Ripple as an option on Changelly. I went back to Coinbase, had those converted back into USD, then transferred it back to my bank. (Or tried to, anyway. This email is from Coinbase saying that Bank of America was rejecting the chargeback. That's when I called BoA, and they told me that they weren't allowing money to go to, or to come from (my case) crypto companies like Coinbase any longer. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 09:49:43
I think we've hit a language misinterpretation.  
I meant "I don't care for" as in "I don't like the sound of that." 
That's *totally* different than me saying "I don't care about it."  
(Everything's all good, as far as I'm concerned.)  
Edit: This is NOT a "targeted FOMO," fwiw.   
It was *only* meant for others' opinions.

I've looked at this before, when the Bitcoin dominance percentage first got out of whack again (about a month and a half(?) ago, and Bitcoin was actually following an exact track from last *October* (except it was, of course, about 3 months early).  
Anyway, my point is that Bitcoin actually *corrected* to line up and match the TA from 2018 within a week or two. 
So, again, everyone says not to give it any credence, but with evidence like that staring me in the face? 
I just have a hard time believing it's pure coincidence. 
Maybe it's just a "What people *believe* will happen, *will* happen," kind of thing.   
Edit again: Part of me definitely doesn't want the whole thing to be true, because the charts *do* actually say that we've got one more big dip before jumping up in value.
 
(And I honestly just don't have the nuts to Tether out rn; *maybe* half my stack, at the very most.)  
We'll see.

@_date: 2018-09-05 09:34:51
We'll see, but just like the pump that happened on 8/27, that took the price from  ~$6900 to over $7100: it all feels so similar.  
That also happened after a day or two of very narrow highs and lows. 
(So, can I amend the OP to *maybe* 48 hours?)

Oh yeah, if that were to EVER in a million years happen, I'd be *sure* to "give something back" to this sub; everyone's always been so nice and understanding towards me or anyone like me, who wasn't trading Bitcoin when it was a quarter.  
For example, when I ask questions I don't know the answers to, it's like everyone here rushes hand over fist, just to be the one to *help me first*.

Making $, swing-trading, reds and greens; whatever you wanna call it...
Making money in alts (or more alts in alts) has never been easier, from a trading standpoint, and the same goes for Bitcoin itself.

Coinbase sent me an email saying that it would be deposited on Saturday, the 23rd, but after talking with BoA, they're simply going to continue to block the chargeback. She told me I'd need to work out something with Coinbase alone (like possibly a physical check in the mail.) 
Also, Monday (today) is Christmas, so I don't think anythings getting transferred today, in any case.

TA says that BTC is [due]( for a big pump in the next few days to a week. 
((If TA's all bullshit, (and it very well may be), then it sure is a coincidence that basically every move it's made lately matches up with the chart projections.)) 
What's your take? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 03:57:30
You really blame all this on the alts? They've seemed to be an absolute non-factor once Bitcoin dominance rose over about 47%.

(It feels like *such* a long time ago, even though I know its only been a couple of weeks.)

Actually, I just checked. 
The last 24 hours have had the tightest spread between H/L since July 28th.  
So, it actually has been a while, and if memory serves, FDR *was* the President a month ago.  
Edit: My apologies: 2 days ago the spread *was* only 1.13%, but there wasn't another day in the entire past month that was even close to today and the 25th . 
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:35:04
That's kind of what it looks like is coming if you look at the long-time charts...

I *really* hope the TA doesn't come to fruition.  
Edit: Holy shit! 
@_date: 2018-08-27 19:50:36
By "day", I was referring to that whole '24 hours' type of day, as in the past 24 hours, which *is*, in fact "the past day."  
If you're going by UTC time, like all the exchanges do, yes, there's still 4+hours left in it. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:25:27
It's kinda easy, yeah.  
(I guess that's why I like it.)  
A simple look at the book, the buy/sell walls, and the previous day usually gives you the opportunity for a nice 5-6% swing each day, (if you spent all day at it, that is.)  
Some days I do, and do well. 
Lately it's been damage control, which is pretty exciting when you pull it off. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:30:41

If this is all true (which it appears to be), then why complain? They're basically telling you *exactly* when to buy and sell bitcoin. They're drawing you a freaking *roadmap*, for fuck's sake.  
If the insider trading at Mt. Gox is so blatant that you can illustrate it with a single screenshot, you should "essentially" be printing your own money.  
Why aren't you?
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:53:11

@_date: 2018-10-22 11:12:43
I never mentioned anything about a "zillion" to begin with, and now you're just trying to change the subject after realizing that I was actually in the right all along.  
(P.S.: There's a word for doing exactly that, lol.)
Edit: Just to prove it (again): I just bought 3002 Zilliqa tokens at 523 sats, with *exactly* $100 worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase, where it was priced at $6397: 
$100 divided by 3002 is *exactly* $.03331112591, but Blockfolio tells me that Zilliqa was actually priced [higher than that]( in USD @ 523.  
**The price I paid is equivalent to 508 sats on Binance, because BTC is at $6563 there.**
(Would you not agree that 508 sats is a much better price than 523?  
Last time I checked, 508 was still lower than 523, but the planet could've gone through a wormhole or something since then, I will admit.)
So, anyway: yeah, it does make quite a *huge* difference
.  
**Zilliqa won't even come anywhere even *close* to 508 sats today; its just hovering in the mid 520's right now, and its daily low is 521 sats.**
Lastly, and I'm sorry to break it to you, but I'm in the right on this whole thing.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:34:03
But ultimately, if you ever sell, it'll be for X amount of that "dirty fiat."  
It's kind of funny that while all the holders do nothing but go on and on about how awful the dollar is (or fiat in general), that's *exactly* what they base their BTC's worth on, and what they'll one day end up trading it for.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:07:27
There are PLENTY of alts that are now worth *essentially* nothing, some heavily-traded ones that are down 98+% in the past year(ish).
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:17:30
**I know where I'm buying *my* Bitcoin.**   
Edit: At its peak, Bitcoin was over a *thousand bucks* cheaper on Coinbase over Binance.  
That's just nuts.
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:41:27
If you trade/buy enough on Coinbase, and use the Coinbase Pro (gdax.com) trick to get out of paying a bunch in fees *it can easily make it worth it. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 09:17:55
But the whole concept behind USDT, TUSD and others like it is this:  
They're *supposed* to.  
The value of 1 TUSD or 1 USDT is *supposed* to be *exactly* equal to the value of 1 USD.   
In fact, that's their *only* function as cryptocurrrencies, isn't it?  
And, yes, I realize that's not always the case.
(If I'm missing something, please tell me, because I admittedly don't know all the ins and outs of Tether, TrueUSD, and the others. I just assumed that's what they're there for.)
@_date: 2018-10-22 06:24:12
I know for a fact that I paid $.0316 at 511 sats for Zilliqa when the daily low was $.0337, and 509 sats.   
I did the math for the number of tokens I got based on Binance's price for Bitcoin, and it worked out to around 492 sats.    
So, yeah, I do actually "have a clue what I'm talking about."
@_date: 2018-10-06 13:36:26
"Certainity"?  
ELI5; sorry.  
(Edit: If that's an actual word, I've never heard it used.) 
@_date: 2018-10-22 04:12:23
I've done the math, and, for example,  I picked up some Zilliqa tokens at the equivalent of 10-15 sats lower than I should've paid (almost a quarter of a cent lower than the actual daily low.)
So please don't try to tell me that it "works out the same in the end"; it most *definitely* does not.
@_date: 2018-10-08 17:54:18
I understand the concept behind all that, but it's still just strange to continuously see. 
For example, just as kind of an experiment, I bought a $100 worth of BTC early this morning on Coinbase for $6555 (it seemed like a great price right now). 
Then, I barely lost anything in fees, moving it to Binance thru Coinbase Pro. 
It was automatically worth $106 "Binance dollars,“ and was worth close to $120 when I Tethered it out at $6690. 
The last part of the experiment was buying back in @ $6660, which wasn't a big difference, but with a dash of BNB it was fee-less as well, and I ended up with like $122 worth of Binance BTC.  
So, the whole meaning of all this is that I had a quick 120% ROI on my little bit of $.  
My question is: Why aren't more people trying this with larger amounts?  
(Or are they already?) 
 
It felt like the price difference was half the battle, (though I do realize that the BTC pump came at a pretty opportune time.)
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:03:37
I've also bought some more ZIL with ETH through Coinbase via Binance for about .003 cents lower than the cost of what was ~$.036, I got them for ~$.033.
 
(That may not sound like much, but getting an extra 12000 ZIL for only right over $400 was a pretty amazing buy, IMHO.) 
That's a good bit lower than the daily low of $.03541. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 19:56:51
Sorry, I always get that wrong. 
An ROI of 20%.
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:21:14

Thanks, USDT.   
I just *knew* that all those things people were saying about you weren't true, lol.

@_date: 2018-10-15 11:02:31

Wouldn't be the first time, for sure.  
**Edit: I'm not.**
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:08:25
I'm just telling you, I've been buying tokens today (Zilliqa specifically) for a good bit under the daily low. 
(See my other post.) 
@_date: 2018-10-08 19:57:34
Lol.  
Maybe I should do the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:23:08
Sure.  
(Just not from you, if that's okay with youyou're a bit snarkey for my tastes.)  
 Anyone else would be fine, I'm sure.  
**Edit: I've done the math, and, for instance, I'm buying Zilliqa tokens for ~12 sats lower than Binance's price with Bitcoin bought through Coinbase.  
Currently, it's price is $.035004..., and as an experiment, I just bought 643 for exactly $20 worth of "Coinbase Bitcoin", which is $.0311042....** 
  
**That's a significant difference: I don't care what anyone else in this thread says.**
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:56:27
My fees are just fine, fwiw.  
(My rating on Coinbase is level 3, and VIP 4 on Binance, for example. I'm sure I'll never even get a *sniff* of level 5 though, lol.) 
So with a dash of BNB (a tiny one) they're virtually nonexistent on Binance.  
Thanks so much for asking!   
(Wait...that *was* supposed to be some kind of constructive comment, right?)  
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:28:05
I didn't say I filled up there. I bought a couple gallons til I got to a normal-priced station.

Really. I paid $3.69 a gallon for gas yesterday because I ran out in the wrong (rich) part of town. It's usually $2.59 where I live. Gas (which produce and dairy prices follow) could *easily* double in five years, especially with the (overall) weakness of the USD.  
That doesn't make up all of the cost of living, but it's a *major* part of it.

Oh, well that's a humongous difference. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:50:17
Bitcoin could never "halve" or "split," because of the lhard limit of BTC that exist (21,000,000), correct? 
(I understand that dropping from 10K per to 5K per in one day, or vice versa, is essentially the same thing.) 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:40:52
I read somewhere that the expected, eventual price would be around 120K per BTC. Anything over that doesn't work out in the math, (aka: something *else* I couldn't understand about limited-issue crypto systems.) 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:47:33
That was nearly all the bitcoins in existence at the time. (I think there were around 5 million in existence back then. There's only 20 million today.)

Good point. I didn't think of that. Of course you wouldn't have to buy an entire Bitcoin to trade in them. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:10:22
Bitcoins weren't even traded until 2010. And the plan all along (which is still in place) was to never have more than 21 million bitcoins in existence. Only ~half of those have been mined so far. So you couldn't ever have purchased $200K worth of them at 1 cent apiece. They were already worth 40 cents apiece in 2010.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:11:51
You sound like you're well versed in this subject.

The fact that there is such a low number of bitcoins out there (around 20 million), means that any major trade would have a significant impact on their individual worth. You would *definitely* have to mete them out over months/years probably to see close to the return you'd hope for.

Bitcoin withdrawal into Coinbase's prices doesn't give you the fiat you're after.
  
But selling your Bitcoin into Ethereum (where the prices are about the same as they are on Coinbase) on Binance, *then* transferring that to Coinbase, then selling it (even at market price) into USD (that you can send straight to your bank) *does* give you the fiat  you'd be after.  
Think about it.  
(It worked for me.)

It's never *stayed* down, and the price it's at now is a great one. And look around and see how many other coins are *seriously* on sale right now, at more of a percentage drop than BTC has taken.

The "higher prices on exchanges" is a good thing.  
The arbitrage gap (and there is one, though it's not huge, and can be even slight) makes that even better!
As I type this, Bitcoin is priced at $5562 on Coinbase; it's also at $5772 on Binance.  
(The gap was over $400 at least one time today when I watched the prices move.)   
**Edit: for an example, I just bought *exactly* $99.78 worth of Bitcoin on Coinbase, and bought 3863 Zilliqa tokens at 473 sats on Binance.**  
**The [math]( proves that I actually paid $.0255708 per token, which is actually equivalent to getting it at 452-3 sats, since the lowest price it's been at this morning (in USD on Binance) was [$.025797]( at exactly [454 sats](
  
**Like I said before, there IS a slight arb gap.**  
(That tiny purchase is already up 5+%, and if I wanted to move it to Tether, it'd actually be up over 11%.)
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:30:28

I've given up on getting Coinbase to work. I use Bank of America, and they make you give your account a "nickname" (which can be your actual name, but it can't have any spaces.)  
Coinbase can't figure this out.  
I kept getting emails every time I tried to use Coinbase that said "your account has been disabled because the name on your bank account, "JohnMSmith" does not match our records of "John M. Smith."  
*Multiple* hour long calls over the period of a month, and they still haven't been able to make it work.  
I *think* that they've given up, but I'm *positive* that I have.  
Edit: on the other hand, when I signed up for Robinhood the other day, the input field said "nickname on your bank account?", and the entire sign-up process took me 3 minutes, and instantly started working without a hitch.

I used the Liberty X app today, and was able to buy $950 worth of Bitcoin for $980.  
They charged a $15 flat fee + 1.5%, using the actual price of Bitcoin.  
For buying bitcoin with cash, locally, I don't imagine there's much better out there. That extra $30 included an optional $1.39 "miner's tip' that ensured the BTC would be in my wallet in between 4 and 15 minutes.  
(I got them in 6.)  
Disclaimer: There are Liberty X places all over my city, and they all can set up their own fees however they want to. You can see them all on a map of your area, and choose the one that's best for you.  
This was the best deal I could find that was within 15 minutes of me.

The only one I've used, it took me about 30 seconds for the whole transaction. You slide in your driver's license, and it gets all your info from that (you don't have to type anything), then it prompts you to feed money into it. Then, when you've put in the $ you want, it finishes by printing a receipt with the details of your transaction. Then, when you get home, or like 15 minutes later on your phone, you just log onto their website, use your driver's license # as your password, then move those coins anywhere you want to.
It honestly *could not* have been simpler, or quicker. Here's a picture of a receipt I found from the one I used:

Protip: Use someone else's driver's license!  
Edit: But seriously, even Coinbase requires your driver's license or official ID, and that's just for starters. By the time you get done getting verified for ANY site that sells Bitcoin, they know it all. They all require SO much documentation; by the end they all know basically every single personal identification piece of info that exists; sliding your driver's license into a machine is a LOT less intrusive than applying for one of the other sites, where they'll ultimately end up with your banking information, your password for that, your IP address, your mobile IP, your social security  freaking everything!  
The ATMs (at least) barely scratch that surface. If their fees weren't so outrageous, I'd use them, but I think localbitcoin or Liberty X are going to end up my top two methods of transfer, at least until Robinhood gets totally going, which'll probably be longer than they're saying, unfortunately.

Move it into Ether on Binance, ultimately, when you want out after you've traded what you wanted to, then move *that* back to Coinbase and sell directly back into USD.

It doesn't matter what the article says; it's the headline that most people will just see, and make snap decisions about.  
Unfortunately, that's the world we live in.  
These new investors bought because of multiple headlines, and the headlines are what will influence other possible new investors.  
If Joe Q. Public sees headlines like this enough times, do you really think he's finally going to make the leap and finally invest his hard-earned money into BTC?  
I don't think he will.  
He'll probably put it off until it's official, or the price drops to where he feels better about jumping in.  
Therein lies the rub:  
What are *headlines* (not the actual content inside) like this going to do to the short-term price of Bitcoin?  
(And whether it's this post or another like it, it *will* be news for the next few weeks.)
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:09:52
What's your BTC wallet address, OP?
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:04:53
Only 2 exchanges out of all of them had it *barely* under 6K. Now it's back to an average of almost $8000.  
I'd say I pretty much nailed it.
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:56:46
You can easily see where it's cut.  
Now, trace your finger on the angle from the left side that's already developed by July...  
(It goes *way* over last year's.)  
Edit: If you'll notice, it's developing the exact same trend (they really do look identical) *now* that didn't occur until October of last year.  
That's freaking huge.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:06:51
He might just get that moment today.
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:39:37
The low was 6K.  
That's what I had my alarm on at, and that woke me up, (at 3 in the morning) and was exactly when I bought a bunch of alts.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:05:24
January 21.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:13:06
Oh, yeah: I've been a fan since you first brought an example to Reddit.
Keep up the good work!!!
(Edit: If you could please put a reverse-time function on it to take me back to before I got killed with alts, that'd be just peachy.  
Thanks in advance!)

Consider though, the odds of HTC even being around for another 5 years is slim, the way they've been doing things in the past 5.   
**Once they were a legitimate player, now they just get played by Samsung, Google, and Apple.**
  
(And I'm saying this as an admitted HTC fanboy; I've *loved* every device I've ever owned made by them... but that doesn't really matter when nobody else is buying their products any longer...)
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:54:57
It'd take an exchange making it their policy to make that a solution.  
But for instance, Binance isn't about to let people move their dust into BTC instead of BNB.  
That will *never* happen.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:52:29
[FINALLY!!!]( someone gets it!
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:03:22
The issue is that nobody's selling right now.  
Would you really waste your BTC to buy a DVD on eBay?
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:12:51
As a fine-dining server, I used to occasionally get them as tips back in 2011, and they all went straight into the trash can bc I thought they were about as worthless as getting "Jesus pamphlets" were.  
I don't even like imagining just *how much* money I just threw away back then.
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:58:44
I think it's closer to 17m, from everything I've read.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:52:00
Stay strong, brother!
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:46:02
Whatever happened to the Bitcoin tipbot?
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:09:25
Edit: I meant to say *sell* orders.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:08:23
Whoops, brain fart while typing and I can't change it now.
Either way; why not?  
Edit: (The fact that I'm joking about something stupid while Bitcoin is over 8K is all that really matters; nice few-day run!)
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:25:19
Exactly.  
Imagine that x10 on some Anime DVD. 
Just the shipping cost alone could translate into thousands of dollars lost after a few years.
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:08:00
Not it either, but that's cool looking.  
This one was like being on a 3D playing field, and the buy/sell walls/orders were represented by differing colors of 3D polygons (rectangles and squares mostly) that moved towards one another. 
 
It was *very* cathartic to watch.
**EDIT: FOUND IT!**  
Thanks to Redditor : this can be viewed live at 
(These are Binance trades in action.)
@_date: 2019-05-29 16:42:55
Never thought of it that simply, but the math checks out.  
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:12:33
They most certainly did, and I agree on the "early adopters" part wholeheartedly.  
Because it was so early, neither I nor anyone with whom I worked had ever heard shit about Bitcoin, or crypto in general, so we basically groaned inside the few times it happened to us.  
We didn't clock in to back then to get "make-believe" money for waiting tables; we were all in it for the straight cash every night.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:01:19
Tell that to the tens of millions of traders; see how that works out for you.  
Fudging a tax return? 
Omg: that might be the first time in history *that's* happened. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:06:10
But a *shitton* of people watch CNBC; that matters.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:06:22
I'd bet it ends up being a LOT more; like exponentially more. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:24:12
That may be true, but I know very well that, for example, my dad's generation, still watch that shit every single day, and his generation for the most part has a lot of money that they can invest in *something*.  
TL;DR: People with money saw this on TV.

**I'VE PAID MY TAXES FOR EVER YEAR THAT I'VE EVER WORKED.

**Show me where I've "boasted"  about "not paying taxes for 30 years", PLEASE.**
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:01:41
Cool thought. 
30 plus years and still not even a letter.  
Edit: My money is in so many banks, and in a safe, and elsewhere, the IRS will NEVER get their paws on it; it's a *logistical impossibility*. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:14:37
Sell then buy back immediately; the IRS has no info on what you do on an exchange: only info of the fiat you spent in the first place. 
No loss in trade; no loss as far as the IRS is concerned.  
Your "wash trade" happens instantly.  
**Edit: you just report the sale.**
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:03:06
True. 
Ever heard of a wash trade? 
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:33:25
Interesting...it seems that people are using Bitscribble to log their wallet addresses?
Why would someone do that?
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:02:55
TBH, alts are *much* easier to successfully day-trade with than BTC itself.   
Alts are easy (some extremely so...).  
Bitcoin?   
Not so much.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:48:03
If history *really* repeats itself, it'll go high in January just like it's done since its inception. 
Bitcoin's value has always been measured in January and July of each year: 
Edit: that doesn't mean it'll *stay* high, just that if we're going off "history repeating itself," that logarithmic trend will continue.  
Go high, then dump. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:38:05
I *definitely* didn't have a wallet, but IIRC correctly, the tip paperwork (**"Congratulations: you have just been tipped X amount in 'Bitcoin': come join us in the movement which is digital currency at 3dub.blah, blah, blah..."**) that was left had long numbers and equivalent dollar amounts printed on them.
I'm guessing now those were their addresses connected to an "escrow wallet", and a password/key to retrieve the BTC (which again, none of us ever did; seemed like a money scam at the time...)
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:06:05
Lamborghini has to be one of the biggest supporters of Bitcoin mooning possible...

I don't live in Southern California; never will.
FWIW, my home is 2600+ sq. ft., 4 bedrooms and game room, and is currently valued at nearly $240K, when I bought it, it was $85K. 
**BTW: Are you seriously using Reddit to insult me and try to make me feel bad about my life? 
Not everyone wants to live in SoCal and pay exorbitant prices for living just to say they can. 
Excuse *me* for not being a part of that.**
Edit 2: Shame on you, you fucking belittling braggart. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:56:30
Well, it *just* crossed $6400 pretty quickly; we'll have to see what $6750 brings next.
@_date: 2018-12-16 04:30:13
Lol: I tethered out at $7300 and thought I was SO smart when I didn't jump back in until the "bottom" @ $5900. 
Me now: 
Har-de-har-fucking-har. �� 
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:25:07
None of us knew shit about how to spend it or "cash it in"; we treated them like IOUs from strangers, bitched about it a little bit, then moved on to the next table.  
(Also, this wasn't an everyday thing back then whatsoever; I just remember it happening a few times at one steakhouse where I worked, and from that I can pin the timeline as either 2011 or early 2012.)
Adjusting your analogy, back then it was more like getting a $ gift card from a coffee shop on the other side of the planet we'd never even heard of, and none of us wanted to even bother with it.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:43:45
I was talking about *real* exchanges: not Coinbase or Gemini.  
Crypto to crypto exchanges. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:48:48
Thanks so much!!!!
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:46:41
Timing the market over a period of years isn't hard, which is what you'd essentially be doing.
Bitcoin has always "covered" since its inception.
@_date: 2018-12-23 01:13:16
??? 
It's just Binance's Android app.  
I'd guess that their iOS app/PC interface is pretty much identical... 
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:46:41
The big question we're all wondering... 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:09:31
That's great advice.  
(Unless we're already at the bottom.)  
$3150 is pretty freaking low. 
Edit: AND it looks like that *was* the actual bottom. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:19:04
**I've never been audited.**
FWIW, I own my house outright, and pay not only to Uncle Sam (through my paychecks), but also my property/MUD/HOA fees as well. 
It's not rocket surgery. 
Edit: However, "Uncle Sam" won't EVER be able to come after me for **ANYTHING** related to crypto. 
I "lost everything" on a bad Monero trade, lol. 
(Let *them* try to prove I didn't.) 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:11:41
In the long-term, it's not going to matter too much, bc I don't see it going even close to $1K, but whaddo I know? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:08:40
You're completely deluded if you really believe that.

**WTF are you talking about?**
Holy shit...

Nope, that's not it.  
Thanks, though.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:17:55
Then you should be golden.  
Coinbase has never made me "re-qualify" my identity; once you're in, you're in.
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:39:07
All he has to do is go to Bitfinex or wherever and actually pay $1 million for a single BTC, which would essentially prove himself right, saving his dick.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:18:07
It also *might* be their last-ditch effort to stay in mobile device manufacturing whatsoever.  
Their market share is now less than 1% of all mobile devices.  
They've lost a ton of it in the past few years...
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:04:23
Ok; apply it to this whole situation. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:26:51
Dude, I live in Houston, TX: it's the 4th biggest city in the country. 
I still can't even wrap my head around why you're taking this stance to try to make me feel bad about my fucking life.  
("You're a dick, who's unhappy with your own life", is the *only* thing I can come up with.)

**You missed the backstory because there isn't one: that guy's a complete moron.** 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:38:46
I'm not reporting SHIT, fwiw. 
I MADE money this year; quite a good bit. (Enough to buy a couple of cars for cash, and I still have a couple of Bitcoin, and a very large chunk of ZIL, which I've been swinging down (latest is 377 sats.)
(Ninja edit: And I'm swinging *those* from 381 sats to 374, 3, 2 1, 370, 369, and 368.  
Watch and see if that doesn't happen tonight, in the wee hours of the morning; trust me, it will.)
On that note, I may be a "special case" because I work in the restaurant industry for my "real job," and not only have I never been audited in 3 decades+, I definitely don't expect to be now. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:26:14
But the government doesn't know about ANY of that, unless you cash out into your own bank. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:29:37
Of course it could; that's the big gamble everyone's playing right now. 
I'm just saying that accidentally making the mistake of trying to DCA when it's already bottomed makes for a *very* uncomfortable trading situation.  
Edit: And maybe people are *already* FOMOing; OP is one example, for sure.  
Edit 2: Where do the resistance buy walls stand, as of now, and how strong are they?

How you feeling about this comment now?  
(Just curious; no beef intended..., but a 25+% rise in a week is something to acknowledge... )  
Edit: Something that *should* be acknowledged, and addressed. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:20:11
How many "newly minted coins" , do you suppose, at the highest end?  
(Your best guess...) 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:25:10
I don't know how to make it clearer than I already have. 
Re-read my comments. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:53:03
In reality, how many BTC would you guess are even still mineable? 
17 million out of 21 million confirmed accounted for/mined, but that doesn't take into account at all the hundreds of thousands/millions that have been lost or just plain thrown away over the years.  
(I, for one, can attest that I *threw away* hundreds, for example.) 
There are NOT 4 million Bitcoin left to mine; to think so would be just putting your head in the sand. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:39:16
Keep bragging, shithole. 
You lose face every time you do that.

I mentioned neither Tether nor any "shitcoins.'
What are you going on about? 
@_date: 2018-12-16 04:37:11
Which you can actually do, essentially with any crypto, by swing trading it down. 
 
So, yeah, you *can* make money in a falling market. 
(I managed to tread water for a good while by doing this, but suddenly the "fairly calm bay I was swimming in" quickly became a "huge fucking wave-pool," and there was no way in hell I wasn't going under...)

@_date: 2018-12-23 04:35:08
I'm just SO happy I got a TON of Zilliqa at 377 sats.  
 
(Probably *the* best investment I've ever made.)   
(it's currently at 470, and I got it  when BTC was around $3200.)
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:24:10
Exchanges do NOT report trades to the IRS. 
Read your agreement with the exchange of your choice. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:38:57
Exactly. 
I'm not even on their radar.  
Edit: Sure, I may be "just a wage earner"... One who has his days free until 5-10 p.m., 5 days a week. 
And I still own my house, my cars, have no debt, and pull in roughly $60K a year.   
AND I've managed to get my daughter from birth into (now) high school (happily) as a single dad. 
I wouldn't trade my job situation for anything. 
Everything I've wanted, I have. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:45:00
Should've bought in at $8008.5...just for luck.  
(You can never go wrong with BOOBS, lol.)
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:03:57
Liberty X's fees are a drop in the bucket compared to what the ATMs charge.  
I checked one a few days ago: their price for BTC was $800 more than Coinbase's, *plus* an additional 6%, which is insane.  
It was also a buy/sell ATM, and the sell numbers were basically the same, but inversed.  
**TL;DR: Eff BTC ATMs.**
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:59:20
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:29:51
It's the *exact* same thing "whales" are doing right now, fwiw: 
"It’s very possible that large groups of holders are trying to reduce their 2018 tax liabilities by wash trading ....unlike traditional equities like stocks, technically they don’t need to sell/buy the same exact Bitcoin (and technically the way it works you can’t...) and also unlike stocks wash trading crypto isn’t illegal (yet). So even though these specific wallets might not have activity in 2018, they could still be being used for wash trade purposes." 
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:31:22
Hopefully...  
Why *wouldn't* someone buy/sell @ BOOBS?  
Reuters Headline:  
"Bitcoin has been trading sideways @ BOOBS for a few days now."
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:57:56
Still not one step closer to it becoming recognized as an actual ETF in the US (or anywhere else in the world...), except emotionally. 
Imagine how much it would pump if/when that ever happens...
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:15:34
Bitcoin's rise (and fall) in price has always been logarithmic, not based on a simple slope formula, but maybe that's just my opinion.
