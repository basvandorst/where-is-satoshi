Are you one of these guys that come out of their basement when there is a dip to be smug and then stay away for the months where new ATHs are made?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:10:37
Do you want examples were it dropped even more or what is your point? Why do people like you come out of their hole after such a dip? Is it schadenfreude or regret?

If I want to spend money on something can I come to you and ask you if it is ok or a waste of money? Because it seems you are the one who decides. What kind of people are on reddit? Are you for real?

5k btc
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:45:38
Yeah ok, that's true. I think I wouldn't mind doing the annual growth either. Let me think about it (the coins) and contact you tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:23:33
So basically you are saying none of the top30 coins will do 100% and I say some will, at least 1? 1:1?

RemindMe! 6 months hey I'm here from and I'm an internetwarrior. I know everything. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:52:07
lol, are you nuts?
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:37:22
Ok, that's not what you said (saying none of them will but ok).
What if we took todays prices and if the coins hit 100% we are done? You know, I could sell/take profits and don't have to wait till december.
