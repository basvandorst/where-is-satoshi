Don't shoot the messenger. 
**Professor Griffin** and his team did the research and published the result. The credibility comes from the fact that the University of Austin gave him a job as a Professor who has been through years of research, study, and publications. The university is a governmental approved institution for education. Here is his short bio; **Professor John Griffin** is the James A. Elkins Centennial Chair in Finance at McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. He is currently serving as a Board Member of the Western Finance Association. He was also as an Academic Director of the Financial Management Association and served as Associate Editor for the Review of Financial Studies.
So where are your facts for disapproving his research?

**Mining bitcoin** is the way to go. Bitcoin or alike cryptocurrency is the future of exchange medium but until the Fiat currency goes bust and get eliminated from the society, we are going to experiencing a bumpy road.

Banksters are scared of losing control :) No more billion-dollar transaction fees cannot be charged to ordinary citizens.
Surely, they won't sit around and see their infrastructure crumble down to dust. They are planning something. Need a whistle-blower to come forward.

So, since **Bitcoin** price was **manipulated** and it is on falling cycle, don't buy it until the price crash is bottomed out and the dust is settled. if you can buy today 2 bitcoins for roughly $12000, maybe you can buy tomorrow 12000 bitcoins for $0.50 a piece.

bitcoin is U$7300 and it seems to be on the downward spiral but don't lose faith. Due to the devaluation of US dollar, the true value of bitcoin will rise from the ashes like Pheonix.

I believe in bitcoin as the future of currency and means of exchange but at what price I will dive in, is another question.

Interesting point but when you refer to CFTC as the defender of justice, then the question is: which bankster was arrested and put in jail for the fraud and causing the crash of 2008 financial market or the purchase of the extraordinary amount of PUT options by "some entities" days before the 2001 twin tower 911 attack?
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:48:40
nice. Fiat currency is losing value and cryptocurrency taking over.

I second Calgs' comment. the study was not speculation, it was based on analysis.
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:56:04


I did answer it right below your question. **you** = **Professor John Griffin** not equal **me**.
I don't see your answer to my question of what facts do you have to disapprove **his** claim/research/conclusion?
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:33:00
what price in future did you have in mind?

Can you elaborate on "unflexible credit supply against bitcoin"?
Could be an interesting topic in [bcconf](
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:40:26
hehehe... I know :) thanks for tips. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:02:06
Thanks for the explanation. One problem that I can think of with bitcoin is that the founder set aside about 1 million bitcoins for him-/herself as savings and the rest of the world is supposed to share the rest of 20 million bitcoin tokens. of course, as the founder, he/she needs to be rewarded proportionately but 1 million bitcoins, while there are only 21 million, can be generated is questionable.

hmmm.... I didn't read the paper? most definitely not the same paper as you read.
IF you read the above post, **[the study]( was published by University of Texas. Get your facts right!

As if I worried that Bitcoin was going to go away....ufff :) Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency are here to stay!

No one can answer that yet. Usually, the truth comes out later but speculation perpetuates.
