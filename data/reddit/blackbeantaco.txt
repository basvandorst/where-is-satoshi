Whooaaa whoa whoa, whoa.  Let's just all agree to try not to piss the guy off until I get my frozen coinz out of his exchange.
(Just kidding.  Kind of.)
**Edit:**  Truthfully, I've always thought it was irresponsible to leave BTC or cash sitting on Mt Gox after everything that's gone on with them over the past year or so.  That being said, I got caught with my pants down procrastinating on moving some BTC to a personal wallet and now they're frozen indefinitely.
I believe there shouldn't be room on the Foundation for someone running an exchange that isn't completely up-to-date with all of the newest releases and known issues.  And the public statements he makes are beyond cringe-worthy.

More importantly - since the difficulty increases and the reward halves over time - there's a finite point at which producing BTC has no value. 
$99 Bitcoin  @  $1   Electricity/Depreciation
$50 Bitcoin  @  $9   Electricity/Depreciation
$25 Bitcion  @  $13 Electricity/Depreciation
$13 Bitcoin  @  $17 Electricity/Depreciation

I totally agree wit you first sentence.  But if we assume that Bitcoin becomes anything except the MOST universally-accepted form of currency, then we will have to convert it here and there.. and therefore claim earnings.  Even then, it may only be a small amount, but it would be taxed none-the-less.
 
I don't want to waste a bunch of anyone's time debating taxation though; there are bigger issues to discuss.
 
Are you, or "a guy you kno" increasing your Bitcoin worth tonight?  I "know a guy" who will be.  And he will be, not surprised by another crash, but expect it.  And then another.  And maybe rack up during each, and sell off during the climbs.  But that cycle has to end.  Whether it is because price-searching ends and Bitcoin settles at its close-to-permanent value, or whether it is because the whole thing cracks, one way or another it has to end.  The rollercoaster has to turn into a slow-moving set of bumper cars.  Just like the "dotcom bubble".  How do we know when?  How do we know to keep playing it instead of cashing out? How do we know when it's time to stop getting back in line for the ride? How do we know holding for the long-term is better than taking the quick profit now and forgetting about it?  
 
How do we know we're not all just a bunch of "too young, too idealistic" cunts who can't rally together to actually beat the system?
 
 
......or can we actually do it?

Gotcha.  I didn't realize, until I had time last night to read through the filing, how long ago it was written.  I also based the total number of BTC in the trust on an estimate using only 1% of 11 million.  Still an interesting way to look at it.

Yeah would definitely cover any losses he's a good guy he wouldn't just screw the tenant... plus I'm guessing the guy would sue him for it if it really ever came down to that.  The thing is, the guy is renting for 2 years.  So he can buy $2,400 of BTC ***right now*** and then save a measly 100 bucks a month for the next 2 years to cover the deposit if the whole BTC market goes to 0.

Will confirm once I have the keys to the condo in my hand... but right now it looks like - appropriately so - it will be viewed as a deposit of *my* cash resulting from the sale of an investment, and not money withdrawn or money deposited related to acquisition of new debt.  It's my money, it's real money, it's really in my bank and really didn't come from a loan or other debt.  The underwriter - who you of course know is not any kind of tax authority - doesn't think anything else should matter.  And neither do I.  Tax implications are a whole separate monster, but as far as approval for a loan: I had a thing, I sold the thing, and now the money from that thing is in my account.  
I love hearing from him and talking to him about this though.  He's an underwriter.  He's a *pretty* intelligent and finance-savvy guy.  He's been around a while and makes tons of money.  He knows his shit to say the least.. but didn't know about Bitcoin **ever** until Monday.  And now he knows about it.  Now one more person on planet Earth that never knew about Bitcoin knows about it.  And he's fascinated that they're ~4 years old, trading @ &gt; $100 worldwide, mined electronically and part of a fixed number of units that will never increase through central banking regulations.

Well, sell @ 119 according to his example, but yeah, basically.
  
And uh, to answer the OP, yeah dude. Yeah, selling for more than you paid is what most of us would consider a "good" thing.  You have to understand the risk and volatility involved in this market before you start gambling with too much though, and also remember to keep in mind the 1.2% you'll lose on transactions once Gox ends this "free trades" promotion they're running.. assuming you're talking about trading on Gox.

Free at its core - but for how long?  Is anyone willing to bet that the US government WILL NOT impose tax regulation on Bitcoin earnings? I doubt that.  And earnings don't have to come from those involved only for investment; I bought my first Bitcoins because I am an avid libertarian and nothing has ever made me happier than the rise of a decentralized currency from one US penny to over a whole US nickel.  But if I happen to have 20 Bitcoin in 50 years, worth 100,000 USD, and I need to convert some to USD to buy a car (or anything else), then I have to realize and claim the earnings on the Bitcoins on my tax return.  That's no longer truly unregulated.  With an exchange, say Mt. Gox, controlling over 5-10% of the market (let alone over 80%), it isn't decentralized.

So say I have a piece of land I bought for $50,000.  I put it on sale for $90,000, because of course I'm trying to make money.  If no one values that land at $90,000, which is to say no one buys it, how much money have I made?
I didn't mention their IPO in relation to the current exchange rate, or April's exchange rate or any other exchange rate.  Just that based on those assumptions, the Trust is valuing BTC near 182 USD.
