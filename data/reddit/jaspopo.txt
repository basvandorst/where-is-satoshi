It's an argument for bitcoin to be maintained as sound as possible in the gold sense.
@_date: 2016-07-23 08:41:56
Is it interesting?  Well maybe its cool that there is factual evidence of such truth.
@_date: 2016-07-23 08:41:08
do you think r/btc will be able to claim they never mod people anymore? have you ever googled the phrase "game theory"?
@_date: 2016-07-22 20:28:14


The modlog is there to "read".

It's there, 4 up votes because steemit is a fruad scam as far as I can tell ;)

u/nullc r/btc no longer has a claim that it doesn't do anything theymos did. Evidence shows otherwise. u/pokertravis is banned site wide also.
@_date: 2016-07-22 20:18:11
Also rumors r/btc had pokertravis banned site wide.
@_date: 2016-07-23 08:42:22
Those clowns banned poker travis site wide. and threatened to go further on twitter.

It doesn't matter that you can lie and be disingenuous about the imbalance in your moderation and policies.  What matters is you are constantly now publicly stating that SOME moderation is necessary to maintain free speech.
From there, there is only an admission of subjectively, which all rational actors will see.
You've now lost all the rational actors that you had previously fooled.

Ok tony the tiger.  Whatever you say.  
@_date: 2016-07-23 06:23:56


There you go sir.

Yup agreed, I just wanted everyone to see how ignorant the author is.
@_date: 2016-07-23 09:12:25
cliffs: I wrote a piece on the implications of bitcoin in regard to gold but ignored 20 years of lectures and writings on the subject by John Nash. 
good luck.

It is a coincidental fact that the inherent nature of mining and mining technology makes it possible for the prices of certain commodities that are produced as a result of the devotion of labor and capital to the effort of mining to increase less (or decrease more) than might be expected.  There is a “dimension paradox”: Agricultural products are produced by using the two-dimensional resource of the earth surface, so the “disappearing frontier” creates a limitation. In contrast, some mining, particularly for elemental metals, can essentially be done in three dimensions, although, of course, there are increasing costs for deep digging.
If we then consider which commodities would be optimally suitable for providing a basis for a means of transferring utility, and if we specifically consider the possibility that the trading partners may be located in different nations and perhaps on different continents, than the suitability of such commodities with regard to the ideal function of facilitating utility transfer depends on the extent to which such a commodity seems to have a value independent of its geographical location.
Clearly, in terms of this geographical perspective, gold has historically been optimal, largely because the labor cost of moving it over great distances is so small relative to the value of what is being transported.  Thus, gold formed a very efficiently movable medium for the transportation of a value exchangeable for other values, ultimately deriving, in one way or another, from human labor (with the achievements of warriors here also being viewed as involving labor).
Nowadays, however, few would propose a return to the actual use of simply the metal gold as a standard, for the following reasons.
(i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.  However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.
(ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be “politically appealing.” so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.
(iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such tat even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.
However, right now platinum would be even better than gold, because it has more value per unit of weight.
Crude petroleum could also be used for barter transactions, and in view of the present state of the global economy it would seem a proper component of an index of prices of internationally traded commodities that enter into the costs of industrial consumption.

Some more public statements on mod policies:


They moderate based on bias and personal opinion about bitcoin. We will never silence you because your opinion is different than a moderators on how bitcoin is, was, what it could be. Everyone has a right to make their voice heard here on what bitcoin is to them. That is the difference here.
No more claims about anti-censorship.
