This is so false lol, haven't you heard any of Andreas Antonopoulos' speeches? In general all he talks about is how REAL change can save us from monetary enslavement, for ever. Your type of toxic "me me me" mentality is what fked this world up in the first place. You will get rich don't worry, but we gotta uplift our neighbors too. Community makes the man dude, remember that. That's why a great community coin to invest in is Electra \(ECA\)! BAM!

I bet I can narrow you 2 "sane" gentlemen down pretty well, watch this, someone in his late 20s\-30s, still eats processed food regularly, lots of meat, works 9\-5 for most of his life, voted for Osamba twice and who starts perspiring and getting defensive whenever 9/11 is brought up.
How close was I? Please.. respond.. like a 3/5? 4?

Did you just say coke isn't dangerous for consumption? Are you a shill or just really that stupid?

Sheeple like you are vital parts as well

 I'ts because you're not getting his point. Every time you use fiat money, it is essentially 'their' perspective. 
That is what OP is trying to say I think, which is true and will have to change someday because of the fact that $1 bill weighs the same, is made of the same material, and is as useless in the grand scheme of things as a $100 bill.
