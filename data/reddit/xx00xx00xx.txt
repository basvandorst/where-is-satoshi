Guys reality check here:
* This service facilitates fraud as the underlying gift cards are acquired illegally - hence the giant discount
* There is no reason that bitcoin has to be part of this equation.  This company would be just as effective processing payments with fiat
* The service facilitates fraud...which is precisely why it is using bitcoin
Edit: This stuff is part of the reason banks don't want to hold accounts that transact bitcoin.

Have you ever bought a house?  Ever had a complex contractual dispute?  Ever had to bring legal action against a builder post-closing?  Ever had to resolve a boundary dispute?
Is the blockchain going to fix the litany of problems that can crop up with real estate?  Is Satoshi going to pursue your interests in a courtroom for you?
Buying real estate isn't like buying a bottle of orange juice from the 7-11.  While there are some people (middlemen) in the closing process that are un-necessary in some instances, there is a reason most of these roles exist.
Not every problem in the world can be solved with a distributed ledger.  Mankind has been able to provide accurate record-keeping for quite some time.  This is nothing new.  Sorry.

Pretty much everything listed can be done faster/better without bitcoin or the blockchain.
Had a good laugh at the blockchain garage door opener.  Finally someone figured out a way to make that process unnecessarily complicated.
