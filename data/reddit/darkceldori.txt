I think if put in a temporary properly encrypted file they can be transmitted online.  And accessed from anywhere in the world.

energy is special because all real physical activity, all real economic activity is dependent on energy.   No action can be carried without energy, not even thought, and at each step in the chain there is loss of energy.
Without energy all living structures and all machinery cease to function and wither away till they cease to exist including humans.

They used to do it without a personal income tax.
Nonaggression principle, you ask for money with threat of force, you're a thief, no matter how large or organized you are or how many costumes you put on your thugs.

money is merely tokens for the rationing of access to the finite limited resources.

As more and more people lose their coins, if the supply keeps shrinking and value rising, it is either going to have to be made more divisible or more will have to be added.

Physicists have said that based on quantum theory a thousand gold apples could suddenly appear in your room, along with a dozen hot babes, and that such is not impossible just highly improbable due to quantum laws.   If that is so just about anything can happen, just very very unlikely, nothing would seem to break the laws.

I've suggested it may be a naturally occurring simulation, there have existed naturally occurring nuclear reactors.  And extremely simple rules generate all possible information and unlimited complexity.  So if even an extremely simple medium exists, it could very well generate all possible universes by following a few simple rules.
Now that said, assuming that is so and we're on a naturally occurring eternal computer, which may be of utter simplicity, there is the possibility of altering the running code.    After all physicists have already speculated on the possibility of different physical laws existing in parallel universes, it may be that the physical laws are malleable, difficult to do but possible.
A reality warping machine, an akashic engineering machine, may be possible.  If so it would be the ultimate invention, capable of in a single step reshaping the world.  To me it is something I've wanted to know if it was possible since I was a child, as such guarantees time, security and freedom to the maximum degree.

How?  If your wallet is encrypted and you have backups.  They can do nothing without the password no?
