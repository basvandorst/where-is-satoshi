Is this a Wolf of Wall Street reference?

Did you just completely ignore where he said "it's only a matter of time"?

The author literally explained his reasons for most of your issues. Also your point about cognizibilty is dumb because no matter how many altcoins you send to a Bitcoin wallet, they will never show up as Bitcoin.

I was following along pretty well until:
"At present (this is just my opinion) the relative untrustworthiness of bitcoin’s core devs, who are thought by many to be strategizing for their own benefit, may be inflicting lasting damage not only to the cause of bitcoin, but also to the promise of blockchain technology in general."
Hmmm. ��

It's already a thing. They just need to release the code so people can split their coins. The snapshot has already been taken.

Advertising is becoming irrelevant? I would argue that advertising is become far more relevant with tech companies' ability to target people with ads that are directly meaningful to them. Instead of the shotgun blast approach that old marketing relied on, advertising is becoming a surgically precise sniper rifle. As big data gets bigger, their information will get more valuable as people post greater attention to ads that interest them.

Where is the best place to sell it?

Your premise is flawed. Asteroids can and will be mined in the future. Gold will eventually be able to be created in labs via alchemy (likely at a loss, but still). 21 million bitcoins are all that will ever exist.

2060 is almost definitely past the singularity, so speculating about the best way to buy a diet Coke is kind of meaningless.

Portland, OR or ME?

You're saying that people are buying in because they think it'll appreciate 50x in value, but I believe that if it appreciated only relative to how much fiat depreciates due to inflation, people will consider it to be worth investing in. This isn't necessarily some get-rich-quick scheme. It is very possibly a don't-get-poorer-slowly scheme. If Bitcoin truly does end up eating fiat's lunch, it is likely its value will grow much faster, but that doesn't mean people are using it as a lottery ticket.

I'd like to cash out my share of US Government please.
