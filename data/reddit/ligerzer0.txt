Protip: be nice to people when possible, and simply avoid the fuck out of people(I kind of, like basically, pretty much... just you know... hide out in the fucking forest) when not possible, until the situation changes back to the former. 
Have been using this strategy for a couple of years now, and I'm not sure exactly why it works in the way that it does, but people are always saying I'm a nice guy and shit like that. Now of course, when I hear this, their ignorance infuriates me so I run away and hide until I forget that they're stupid morons, and can come back and be honestly kind towards them. 
I seriously suspect that even when I'm not around, those motherfuckers still speak good things behind my back. 
But since I'll never see them in an upset or unkind state of mind--because really, in the end that's just a waste of my own life and energy--I suppose they simply have no reason to do otherwise. Fuck them.

If we're on the topic, can anyone who knows a thing about  shed some light on them?
Long story short: I have family in Punjab, and have heard multiple reports now of people trying to get them to "invest" in OneCoin.

And yes.
