It happened in Bulgaria a few years ago, when a hoax SMS was sent to tentousands claiming their bank was going to declare bankruptcy. Then we have Greece, Cyprus...

I drive an old one from 1986, navy blue. 
Last month I was involved in an accident (a woman was writing sms) and her car was completely broken. My Landy has no visible damage besides bits of her cars coating. 
I also know of a Landy with 1,000,000 km and it is still running (South Africa).
Congrats, you made a good choice ( it will go up in value since they quit production).

So you tried to take part in a scammy pump and dump scheme and afterwards you wonder why you lost your money? o\_o

Yes, you will never again need to get your engine repaired and the complexity of all the electrical components makes it way easier to lay on hands yourself.

Can you tell me how the spread is? I mean, if they charge more than 3.5% because of a higher buy price.

Whole Malta was a single fortress during the crusades. It’s a strategic important point, lol now for crypto, too.

Well, as merged mining arises, he could mine BTC and would simultaneously mine Elastos, which he could sell for more BTC, then.

The best part they did not mention. 
If you hodl your crypto for longer than a year (self made Excel sheet with transaction dates is enough), gains are completely tax free.  You even haven´t to mention them in your tax averaging, just provide all buy information if asked for.

Correct me if I am wrong, but at the picture we see pacific skipjacks. As far as I know it’s one of few not endangered species. They stay way smaller and are reproducing faster and, importantly, aren’t considered as delicious as bigger species by the Asians. This is also what we europeans get on our tuna pizza.

People got recked really hard when Swiss national bank decided out of nowhere to give up the CHF-EUR pegging two years ago.
People ended up with highly leveraged trades being executed with hundredthousands of Euros of debt. 
If I remember right CHF fell from 1,2 EUR to 0,8 EUR. 
Lawsuits are pending till today.

Store a copy of the keys to take it back if it really lifts off.

There was a stamp available worth [50.000.000.000]( Reichsmark. You had to literally cover the whole parcel with those to get it shipped.

You can buy them at eBay for $10. They are quiet common.
