$400 for a piece of shit that will mine like $40 the first month, $30 the second, $20 the third and so on. You will recover your investment like in 1 year. Then you will mine $5 monthly, just to pay the electricity. :3

Just to know. Here in Chile "piiko" sounds like "pico" that is a very popular slang to say "dick" so maybe is a good idea to use an alias here.
I am just telling all my friends with bitcoin "carga tu celular con el piiko" sound soo funny.

As I understand, xapo is paying the miners fees instead of the customer. 
The miners get the fees anyway.

Actually I asked blockchain 2 days ago about an iOS update and they answered this:
"We'll be sure to make an announcement if and when we do resubmit to the App Store! :)"

What is really important is that coinbase **doesn't give you the private keys** of your bicoin addresses. That means the money is not yours. They hold your money, just like a centralized bank system. 
Without the private keys you can't move your bitcoin in the blockchain directly. In any case coinbase disappears like mtgox you just lose your money.
@_date: 2014-10-25 14:33:46
Let me see if I understood.
A practical example would be: 
If I make a videogame (actually I do) that have some sort of virtual money, swords or whatever virtual asset, bitcoin sidechains allow me to create my own parallel blockchain so every asset could be "translated" as, for example, 1 satoshi, and supported by all the security of the main bitcoin blockchain.
Am I right?

They can't.  But your app won't update until they approve a new version on the app store.

Don't seems a good idea to me to use browser extensions if you use web wallets.

I am from Chile and I pass trough the same situation 2 years ago. Searching and asking for help figured out a trick to achieve the change.
Go virwox.com deposit with your credit card exchange to sll, then sll to btc and withdraw. Have to pay an exchange fee twice but it was better than nothing.
As I understand now are more options to buy with credit card like circle.com or localbitcoins.com. Even in Chile exists some local exchanges.

There is a new technology called vectorial images. Maybe that could scale better. I will spend next month researching on that.

As I understand you can "mix" your bitcoins so them could be untraceable (so fungible). 
The problem about tracking fishy coins is the subjective definition of fishy. For goverment wikileaks could be consider fishy and could be economic blocked easily with a non fungible currency. Or greenpeace, or any institution that conflicts with interest of another. 
Image google not accepting any bitcoin that have touched facebook's address. Of couse they wouldn't do that but with bitcoin not fungible anyone can make that kind of desision.
@_date: 2015-02-17 07:43:57
Governments won't care about your opinion if they want to block any transaction that touched any wikileaks addresses. 
With non fungible bitcoin they can do that.
1 btc from wikileaks != 1 btc from microsoft
@_date: 2015-02-17 12:43:26
I don't mean to block a transaction in the blockchain. 
I mean, for example, if you pay your taxes in bitcoin they can consider your payment illegal if your coins touched wikileaks or whatever they don't like.

Keep the focus in what you are good. Awesome attitude coming from a $106 million company. 
I imagine google with the same stand:

Same here. My 30 GH/s ASIC took 9 months since I paid to when it arrived. 
I've sent them an email asking for a date for shipping, they took 3 months to respond with a speculative answer.
Butterfly Labs give me the worst buying online experience in my life.
