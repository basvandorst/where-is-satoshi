The general advice is "Don't invest what you cannot afford to lose". You should keep in mind that 1 bitcoin can be worth between 0 and a billion dollars 5 years from now. We don't know. :)

No. It is simply Bitcoin without segwit and with bigger blocks.

Can someone explain this to me?

Thank you for writing this :) Usually people go with a few words...

Actually confirmation times will be faster with bigger blocks because it will be possible to fit more transactions in a block reducing the backlog.


Miners spend millions on computation-intensive hardware and electricity. Increasing the blocks will not affect their bottom line in a  meaningful way.


Do you do that? I've never run a bitcoin full node.
Full nodes are important if you need to conduct business related to the blockchain itself. (For example if you are a trader and need information about how many transactions are being processed currently, how many new addresses are created daily, etc...) Also, you need a full node to have voting power in the event of a hard-fork.
You don't need a full node to use bitcoin.


Again, you don't need a full node to use bitcoin.
But also, bitcoin right now is very expensive due to the high fees that people need to pay to get their transactions confirmed by the network. If bitcoin's transaction capacity was better they wouldn't need to outbid each other.
