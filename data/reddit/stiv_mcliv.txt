Exactly. Just wait and see. That price right now will continue to stabilize and drop for now, probably to the $5000-6000 range, then go to the moon in the 2020s

When it's 20k and then sell at 4k
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:26:54
And that's exactly why it's crashing 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:22:02
Seriously. Everyone is panicking without realizing that Bitcoin going from 20k down to 4k is actually LESS of a loss than 2k down to $200. And then it jumped to 20k about a year and a half later...
 I hope it drops to 2k so I can buy some on sale.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:21:27
Seems like a lot of people panic selling right now
@_date: 2018-11-09 13:56:50
We had many bitcoin crashes... look at the history on a log scale. No crash has been significantly higher than the other percentage wise.

1. It's widely known about in the mainstream, but most don't fully understand what it is yet. Many just think it's some random online money that's made up. They don't realize it's inflation proof, and secure in the sense that you cannot make up or destroy a transaction that has been made. Obviously, yes accounts can be hacked; like any currency or store of value, it can be stolen.
2. It's not unlike bitcoin to tank 80-90% before going back up. When numbers get larger in magnitude, it tends to look like Armageddon. 
3. More and more companies are starting to allow BTC payments, and BTC ATM's are spreading, regardless of the fact that it's tanked to $4k. If it's becoming a lot more mainstream, and businesses are willing to use it as an ~~currency~~  investment, will it really tank down to $0?

But it's the same % crash that happened in 2014... 2k to 200. The same thing is happening now but the magnitude is 10 fold. More people are starting to learn about Bitcoin, so it's just a larger population going through the same phase that happened 4 years ago. Mass speculation, FOMO and price spikes to 2k, people panic sell because they were expecting to make money faster than the price can go up, and the price gradually falls to $200. Then... oh wait, the price is 20k????
And then the same thing happens again, just with more people.

He's more so saying, don't panic if it falls a bit more, since it's done the exact same thing in the past. I really wouldn't be surprised if it falls down to 2k before climbing back up.
EDIT: The thing is, people don't typically look at log plots, and the average person doesn't think about how 2k down to 200 is the exact same loss as 20k down to 2k. They just see bigger magnitudes and mass panic even though it's really not that big of a deal

This is a really solid point. Now everyone has heard of BTC, but not many really know what it is... "It's just fake computer money!"

Which at the end of the day is purchased with the same amount of real money since Tether is allegedly backed by the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:47:53
I stand corrected. [It was actually more like 1100 before dropping to 200.]( Still pretty damn significant though
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:16:33
LOL. Going down to $75 would like a full on cliff on this chart. They aren't meaningless. Engineers and scientists use them to track exponential growth.
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:25:11
I will never get this assumption. How did Tether manipulate Bitcoin prices? People will buy BTC whether or not they purchase Tether first? How does the "stable coin" have any affect on it?
BTC has spiked, then tanked \~90% before. Tether had nothing to do with it
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:10:16
I think the only thing keeping it up around 6000 so long was the rise in Venezuela trading. If that never happened, I bet it would have more steadily dropped down to 3000-4000
@_date: 2018-11-06 13:30:23
The haters still can't get a grasp on how it works. Lack of understanding, so "IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING FAKE MONEY HAR HAR HARRRR"
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:39:43
Bought in the 6k "flat point".... I'm thinking of buying more but I kinda want to wait for a better deal
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:43:58
That's basically 90% of this sub right now
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:22:38
Let's look at the peak before 19500, which was something like 1250. Let's say you put in $1000 at the peak, it falls down to $200 (which it did), you now have 16% of your original $1000, so $160.
Okay, now let's do it again but with the ATH: $19500 you put in $1000, but now it's like $3300. That's actually 17% of your $1000, so LESS of a drop than the other scenario. You now have $170.
Absolute dollar value (ie normal scale) would tell you the value drop was $1050, or $16200. The log scale shows you that the $16200 drop is actually losing LESS money than the $1050 drop.
