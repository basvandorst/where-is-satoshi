not bad for a few weeks of sitting on your ass and hoping you don't lose your house
edit: why are you making these all top-level comments?

do you use this? I can buy it through Vanguard, but I have to research it a bit more.

If I sold all my coins now, I can pay back the rest of my student loans. Very tempting. I think I'll keep holding and lessen my held USD cash, instead.

Yep; a few weeks back someone here said, "You'll know we're in a bubble when the front page is all memes and jokes." I think this is an even bigger sign.

I *almost* upvoted this post

this was gradual in comparison to 2013.

Now _that_ is when you know it's time to leverage your house.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:53:42
Thanks for the explanation. I don't want to be in debt forever, and I said I'd pay back the loans, so I will. It would be great if loan forgiveness could be a broader thing. That, and lower-interest-rate loans for students.
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:47:45
I do not
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:29:21
Written off? You already write off interest payments to loans on your taxes. Or do you mean forgiven: pay nothing on them?

Coinbase makes a spreadsheet for you, which helps a lot.

It was listed on the Buy page. Gotta use a Limit order, though.

No, save up for your first apartment.

Which exchange? I'm still seeing $1975.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:29:51
I have already sold 2 coins to keep my crypto balance at 5% of my portfolio, which I deeply regret. This is my risky asset, so might as well play it out as far as I can.

I should have put my money into BTC instead of my Roth IRA this year
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:18:42
Not really; it's mostly been crossposts from Twitter.

It is known.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:50:33
There was a bubble, yes, but that low price had to do with a few external factors (MtGox) rather than BTC itself just being overpriced. If you look at BTC on a [log scale]( it's still pretty even.
I agree with you, there will be a correction. I think we have room to grow before that, but my opinion doesn't mean anything.

That long?!

Fuck Coinbase; just registered for Gemini. I'm pissed that I missed the 2400 crash, but I'll be damned if I miss the next one.
