This is simply NOT TRUE.

Also there are new services which are much cheaper than this.  I use transferwise and pay &lt;1%.

not difficult to set up a direct debit, but if someone does you (the account holder) can claim a refund very easily
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:15:39
Nope, someone setup a direct debit in his name to a charity. Direct debits are guaranteed by the bank, so if someone sets up a fraudulent one you just call the bank and they refund the money. The money guarantee ultimately is taken from the recipient, i.e. in this case the charity.Since it would have hurt the charity due to his arrogance, he chose not to get his money back. But he would have had no problem doing so, since it was fraudulent, the direct debit guarantee would have paid out 100%.

The US government is a violent and unpredictable beast. I wouldn't be placing any bets on the legality of bitcoin gambling.
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:34:02
Bitcoin isn't particularly compelling for online gambling.
Online gambling already exists, and has been working, successfully, for almost 20 years.
There are already a number of payment solutions specifically designed to cater to this market, and reduce the problems of chargeback. Neteller has been trading since **1996**. 
Online casinos do have the opportunity to reduce the use of payment methods with high chargeback risk (credit cards), by insisting on the use of other methods, or by offering bonuses for people using other methods.
There is obviously a niche for casinos to take bitcoins from bitcoin holders, because it's money after all - but for the average gambler, bitcoin just isn't compelling.
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:46:57
uh, the headline here was LEGAL online gambling.
Poker is not my field, but there are a number of casino sites that allow US players to play. Bitcoin just makes it easier to break the law (as with Silkroad).
If that's what you want to talk about, fine.

I am not in the US, but I picked a random city, Springfield, IL, pop 115,000 (because, The Simpsons), and checked localbitcoins for someone who could give cash for btc, nearest was 116 miles, and even it was 1.16 mile the transaction is not foolproof. So that doesn't work at all.
I checked western union's website for locations, and there are 27 of them in Springfield, none of them sketchy.

So how do you send some random person $50 with BTC? Not 0.07 btc, they just need $50 today. How you gonna do that with btc? The people this service is targeted at are not remotely close to using btc.
There is no scam here, $50 is sent and you pay a reasonable fee in relation to the costs involved with that.

Yeah, when the price was $10, the value was 100% underwritten by black markets (as in the black market volume alone was sufficient for that valuation), which would likely always exist.
At the moment the price is underwritten by sentiment, and the risk is much higher.
But people can delude themselves all they like I guess.

Also bank accounts are readily available, and easy to open, it's just that most people don't see any use in them.
There is already a functioning microfinance system  and it works better in a society where people know their neighbours (all of them, every single one), than magic internet money that can just disappear into the ether.

Depends what you mean by practical.
Art is not practical as such, but it has a value through its aesthetic merit. Bitcoins, as numbers, are completely worthless.
Gold's value comes because, like art, it has aesthetic value. And it's been that way through history. 
People all over the globe value gold irrespective of its absolute value - if gold went to $2 an ounce, people would still want it because of its attractive physical properties. Gold is objectively better than dirt. Bitcoin otoh is objectively no better than LeandoverCoin, it only is valued because someone else will buy it.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:13:01
Of course some people are putting larger sums into it, that's why the price is going up. When bitcoins were cheap it wasn't really possible for people to lose their shirt (ok one or two people could have bet the farm, but not many), now many, many lives could be ruined, because bitcoin's market cap is big enough to allow people to put in dangerous amounts of $$$.
Sure if you only put in $5 then that's all you can lose, but the real risk putting in $5 now is greater than last year, because the potential reward is less than it was last year. It's riskier to buy 1 Apple share at $800 than 4 at $200, in other words.

No, 'Indonesia' has not opened the exchange. It's just some random guy in Indonesia who has had a few bitcoin since 2012, and he wants to cash out. 
He runs a web design company: 
This is not the Indonesian government, it's not an Indonesian bank, it's just some dude.
It says:
"Ready stok: 19.949943 BTC"
I.e. they own just 20 bitcoins.
They are selling at $625, and buying at $548.
Given the volatility of bitcoin, you'd be insane to buy on here: 
"Transaksi akan diproses kurang dari 1 jam pada jam kerja (Senin-Jumat, 08:00-17:00). Di luar itu proses maksimal 12 jam."
i.e. we will process your transaction within 1 hour Monday to Friday 8am - 5pm, and outside of that within 12 hours.
So not only do they have a fat +-7% spread on the buy/sell, but also they can eat up another few % of your cash while they wait to process the transaction cancelling/repricing at will.
This site is a bad joke, with a pathetic 20 bitcoins to sell, and it's a poor reflection on the bitcoin community and the general hysteria around it that amateur shit like this can be upvoted and reported on in newspapers.
I have spent a lot of time in Indonesia, and it's utterly corrupt, PCs are pretty much infested with viruses, and the state of ecommerce is a joke (no Amazon in Indonesia), and while it's true that they suffer a volatile currency that has declined 20% in the last few months, and has suffered at least three instances of hyperinflation since 1945, some low-grade web designer's amateur site is not somewhere that actual rich people (of which Indonesia has a large number) are going to shelter their wealth. There's a convenient city-state on Indonesia's doorstep, Singapore, which serves very well for that, and rather than suffer a $548/$625 spread on some amateur's crappy website, you can convert to US$ at a much lower spread:  and save in US$  and other currencies.

nobody is digging roads for $200/year (if they are, it is only because they are only working a few days a year). Monthly wages start around $100/month, but higher in Jakarta.

This is not true.

uh yeah it's more risky at $1000 than $5 because at $1000 people are putting much larger sums into it. People are betting house- and car-sized wodges of money instead than say 'nice dinner'-sized wodges.
Bitcoin at $1000 means that some people are risking big money.

The point here is that Cyprus with a messed up volatile economy is (maybe) going to ally itself with just about the most volatile financial product ever created. I'm not sure it helps bitcoin to look like a sober credible place to hold your assets.

Actually the long-term return of stocks comes from dividends. Without the dividends they don't really grow. See this graph 
Companies such as Amazon not paying dividends come because they want to be perceived as 'growth stocks', they are making a statement that they are using their cash to grow the company to achieve even bigger profits. There comes a point when they are mature and pay out a dividend. An example of a tech company in this state is Microsoft, which has a ~3% yield.
You have to distinguish between capital growth and merely maintaining real value. If shares maintain their real value (i.e. they grow in line with inflation, which means they have the same real spending power year-on-year), then a modest yield of 2-3% is greatly preferable to a savings account, where real returns are negative.
In terms of stocks, the companies behind them can add value, by increasing profit, outputs, etc. A company that grows revenues 100x should see its stock price rise roughly commensurately and we look at the data to see if the stock price appears to be fair. With bitcoin, any price and no price is justifiable.
Of course that's true to an extent of gold, but whereas we have 2000+ years of price history for gold and a good confidence that while we don't know exactly how much it will be worth, it will still be valuable in 10 years time, it is on the other hand unreasonable to assert the same of bitcoin.

Western Union in-person fees from the US are:
$0-$50 - $5
$50.01 - $1000 - $8
$1000.01 - $1500 - $15
then an extra $5 for each $500
Plus if there is a currency exchange they will take ~1% from the exchange rate (I'm not sure the exact figure).
Obviously the fees are expensive for small amounts, but other services also work for this purpose, including paypal, and may have lower costs.
Note that Western Union and others can easily fix the exchange rate, which is important if you need to send someone a fixed amount in a foreign currency.

Rural people in Indonesia have absolutely no use for magic internet money. If they have money to save they buy gold, which is not only a store of value, but also a external signifier of wealth ('look guys at all the gold I am wearing'), or they buy income-generating land (rice fields, palm oil plantations, rubber plantations, which are usually operated on an income-share scheme, whereby the owner of the land and the guy that works it share half the income).
They don't have bank accounts, and while they mostly all have mobile phones now, they top-up their phones $1 at a time (with $0.20 commission) at the numerous phone stalls in each village, and their phones are mostly running on shitty Chinese batteries and aren't particularly reliable, and keeping money on a phone would be literally insane, given that they are frequently lost/broken/stolen, and because if they had cash they would turn it into an income-generating asset (land, public bus service (run in Indonesia by the private sector), chickens, fish, etc.), which makes them the money they need to survive in a country where formal employment is scarce outside of the centre of a few cities, and can be sold or mortgaged in times of trouble.
The people in Indonesia who might find btc useful are the very rich, who can use BTC to protect their money from the weakness of the rupiah, but I'm not convinced that it's better than buying USD or SGD and then investing in an income-generating asset.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:00:13
You *can* buy exposure to a fraction of an Apple share. There are financial instruments that will do this.
Again, the point is that a higher market cap always limits your upside. And with the case of AAPL they produce something useful and have actual physical assets and cash.
Bitcoin has nothing, only people's belief. If that belief evaporated BTC is completely worthless. AAPL on the other hand has a whole bunch of stuff underpinning its value.
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:50:48
Yes there is a lot of money in Indonesia, but unlike China they don't have capital controls. People can get their money in and out of the country without much trouble.
Bitcoin only becomes useful hypothetically when the shit hits the fan and you need to get your money out into a safer currency. This happened in 1997/8. 
The problem with bitcoin at the moment, is even compared to the rupiah, one of the world's least trusted currencies, bitcoin is horribly unstable, and it doesn't represent a safe means of preserving wealth. If you were a rich person in Java, and had exchanged your local currency for US$ in 1996, or in 1945, or in the late 1950s, you would in each case have remained wealthy, and it is this history that ensures that for residents of such countries, the US$ remains attractive.
Bitcoin cannot make that assurance of wealth-preservation, as it is massively volatile, and while price rises have thus far tended to follow the several crashes, it would be unreasonable to rely on this indefinitely.
In fact, if you look at btc vs. IDR, the rupiah has a 15-year record (since 1998) without huge crashes, which is far longer than btc, and yet the rupiah is still clearly a volatile and risky currency - for those seeking protection from unstable currencies, bitcoin doesn't seem the obvious shelter.

Anyone can register a company. I have done so in my own country. I am a random dude, and I don't expect people to send me money, even though I have a company.
You are basically asking people to send you money and trust that you won't steal it. I have bought things from Indonesian ebay sellers and honestly it has worked fine, but that is because there is a feedback system and the purchases have been &lt;$100, so it's no big deal. However for bitcoin the sums should be larger, and there is no feedback system on your site, you could easily steal the money, maybe not today, not tomorrow, but any point in the future (and I'm not saying that you will, but it would be very easy, and for that reason it's not sensible to send you any money).
Also you would appear to have severe liquidity problems. With only 20 btc to sell, that is just $20k. I would say that is a ridiculously small amount of money to call yourself a bitcoin exchange. What happens when I want to sell 1000 btc? I couldn't do it on your site, clearly.
It would make more sense to use mtgox, which, for all its faults, at least can handle useful amounts of money.

Yeah I've purchased a house with cash. I paid with bundles of notes as it happens. It was in a developing country, so it wasn't so expensive (around $10k).


The advantage to USING dollars is that they are accepted all over the world. You can use them.
The problem with bitcoin on the other hand is that, just like a share in AAPL, or MSFT, in most cases you need to convert them into dollars to spend them. That's the reality. Dreams of universal acceptance are just that - dreams.
I can buy shares in a power generating company, and I can look at their income and revenue and figure on a sensible price for them. In future years they are likely to offer me similar buying power and they also provide me with income.
Bitcoins provide no income but if they become accepted in the long term they will maintain (not increase) buying power. In the short term of course it's possible for them to rise in value, but that's purely speculative, their long term future in the best case scenario would be to amount to the same value over time.
So Bitcoins, if still in use, are a better store of wealth than dollars. But we don't know that they will still be in use.
Compared with other stores of value, such as gold and land, they suffer in that they have no intrinsic value - they can always go to zero. And compared with income-generating assets, they are not very good. The interest in bitcoin is almost entirely as a get-rich quick scheme. Maintaining the value of your wealth bores people, since in most cases they don't have much.


It's not about you. You can personally possess 1,000,000 bitcoins, but if nobody else wants them then they are completely utterly worthless. Some other cryptocoins ARE worthless. They are just numbers. They have no utility. Their utility stems purely from people's willingness to accept them. They are not backed by any income-generating assets and the numbers themselves are completely useless.
Uses of gold on the other hand:
* jewellery
* electronics
* dentistry
* art/collectibles (e.g., old coins)
With no investment interest whatsoever, gold is still very valuable.
Your numbers on a computer have no intrinsic value at all.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:52:02
No a higher value doesn't necessarily mean established value.
It can also mean a bubble, as with all those busted .com shares. 
There are plenty of companies that had big values which are now worthless. 
A year ago bitcoin was useful for buying drugs, and that's about it. It had a clear value underpinned by the proven, very real market in narcotics. People *needed* bitcoin, in order to buy drugs.
Today bitcoin is not as useful as it was for buying drugs, and the price is basically entirely due to speculators, and the narcotics market is now irrelevant to pricing. Bitcoin today has much less economic value than it did last year. Sure you can buy a Subway with it, or a car, or a house, but Bitcoin is not adding any value to those transactions, it is not offering any advantages over cash.
Bitcoin's value is no more established than webvan.com's value was.
Buying bitcoins today is pure speculation. There is absolutely no basis for the $1000 valuation. 
A year ago you could have done calculations based on the velocity of bitcoins through Silkroad, the $ value of the narcotics being  sold the number of coins available on the market and come up with a value for bitcoin relative to the $. You can do the same thing with the currency of say Kenya, look at the value of what their country produces and uses this to establish a value for their currency relative to any other.
With bitcoin this isn't possible because now 99% of purchases are speculative, people wanting to use bitcoin to get richer.
With webvan.com shares you could look at revenues and profits and compare them with other investments and come up with a valuation. With bitcoin that's not possible.
Sure, you might say, gold is also speculative, but no, that's not correct, gold is very useful, and if the banks sold it off and it was no longer used as a wealth store, it would still have value.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:40:40
Well no, gold availability is very much determined by demand. If there was less demand that gold would still be in the ground. If the market price was too low, it would not be economic to recover it.
Stocks have a value because they offer a future stream of payments and in addition to that their value keeps pace or betters inflation.
Stocks are as useful as land or seeds.
Paper dollars have no intrinsic value but the point is that they are backed by the government of the US and trillions in revenues and economic output. It's not really possible to wipe that out.
Bitcoins are not backed by anything, that's the difference.
As I pointed out bitcoins have some value for selling drugs already, but that value was established a long time ago and it was ~$10. Everything beyond that is speculative based on bigger fools and supposed future uses that aren't  yet practical.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:21:44


Eh? If bitcoins become the global store of wealth then each coin is worth a fixed fraction of world wealth. That means they don't increase buying power, they maintain it.


I don't see any evidence that the database is very useful, what I see is that a whole bunch of people are saying 'last year bitcoin was $10, then it was $100, and now it is $1000, this is a get rich quick scheme'.
That's not useful, it's a means of speculation, like buying a double-leveraged option on a share or something.


Well people might need this, but it's crazy to suggest that that's what Bitcoin is. It is in fact a tool for speculation, and any practical uses are completely incidental at this point. If it develops practical usage (and like I said the drug dealing is actually worse than a year ago), then it MIGHT become useful, but at the moment bitcoin is a pure speculative play, and objectively it's no better than any other.
I remember when I first used Google, it was in 2000, I used it and showed my boss and said 'this is amazing, this site is **so much better** than Yahoo', and you could objectively see that Google was doing something useful and doing it better than the competition and was doing it NOW.
Bitcoin doesn't have that, people are interested in it because they want to make money. That's all (in nearly all cases). 
Bitcoin is not about distributed networks, or proof-of-ownership, it's about greed.


Well good for you, but the market for these is well-established. These things will definitely be around in 100 years time. You cannot say that bitcoin will still be around, nor that bitcoin represents the best model for a distributed currency (it could be replaced by something else), nor that distributed currency will achieve significant share of the global transaction market (there might be nothing like bitcoin around at all).
