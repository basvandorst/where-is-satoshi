Exactly...but OP is helping!
@_date: 2014-11-20 06:32:47
Most asinine comment I've read in this thread.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:13:04
Lol no one gives a shit about Bitcoin. Stop being such a drama queen.
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:51:24
That kid just got SHIT on.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:33:00
If you're so sure convert all your fiat into bitcoin. Then we'll talk in a year when you're broke and homeless, sucking dick for Reddit Gold.

You must also be a Cubs fan.
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:49:35
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:35:50
This is clearly the reason.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:34:49
Exactly. This should be the top comment.
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:10:40
So they can get some sort of validation. Fucking asinine.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:25:02
Ha, this guy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:01:22
That's the thing I was just planning on letting it ride. Once my first transaction goes through I plan on buying at a higher amount.

You must be fun to hangout with a parties. Don't click on the memes. Problem solved. 
Check out if your jimmies are still rustled
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:18:35
Understandable. There are other ways to buy but coinbase is the easiest for me.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:15:50
What people fail to realize is that we are on Reddit. Not CNN Money, Reddit. A website founded on cat memes. OP needs to chill the fuck out.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:17:40
Same here I've tried both.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:10:24
WE KNOW.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:48:03
Wow. As someone who just opened an account with you guys yesterday, thank you!!
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:44:25
You made yourself seem extremely uneducated. Bravo.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:48:04
I have to say I was one of those ragers. However, you guys were extremely swift in fixing my problem. Reading your comments has really put into perspective what you guys are going through now. So thank you kind sir.

So I just bought a very low amount of BTC via coinbase. I will receive my money later in the week. My question is what do I do once I get it? And what is an exchange? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:05:21
I've been having the same issue for about the last two weeks. I've contacted support over the weekend and am waiting on a response. The issue is probably because you moved recently (I have as well). I just wanna buy some bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:50:31
Thats good advice, Ill definitely look into that. I still have to wait for my pending transaction to go through some its my first. I don't like waiting!
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:08:35
Coinbase makes you give your banking info and is safe....
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:13:27
Okay so I just signed up with coinbase and purchased 0.01 bitcoins. Since everyone is saying the minimum is 0.1 BC will my transaction be cancelled? 
Any other tips would be greatly appreciated, I'm completely new to this. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:20:29
Do you realize what website you're on? Quit being all butthurt and ignore them.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:02:06
Hey, maybe you you shouldn't ask stupid questions.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:57:37
1.) I agree 100%
2.) You threw down the word "cumbersome" twice....that's unprecedented. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:35:57
Don't forget India!
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:53:52
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:03:04
This checks out.
