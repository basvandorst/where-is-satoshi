Entirely different things. The internet 10 years in had a massive adaptation. Crypto 10 years in has a small group of petty degenerates that just want to get rich quick. No meme will ever change this fact.

10 years in the internet had millions of users across a range of industries. 10 years in, all crypto has to show of is gambling and pump and dump schemes. Get your shit straight.

I am old enough to assure you it didn't . Although arguably crypto Twitter has perpetuated the myth that in fact it did - hence all the rektage that followed when the bubble popped. Other than gambling there is zero, null adaptation.

Day to day is more stable. You can transact without losing % of your capital. With Bitcoin by the time your transaction goes through the amount changes. Don't be thick.

I don't think so. It looks pretty stable to me my dellusional friend.

Yeah. Let the Somali farmer put his monthly savings in Bitcoin which is approximately 5 dollars and by the time he goes for next deposit it turns to be 4 or 1. Banking need stability not millennials hoping that a greater fool will buy their bags.

Not really. And I did look it up. None of his companies is on profit. Too many orders, few deliveries and cost benefit looks shit. It won't end well. The only thing sustaining him is delusional millennials that watch too much sci-fi

Where are my 20 Bitcoins?

He did fail . He is using government funds to shill his projects. When will millennial plebs will ever learn.
