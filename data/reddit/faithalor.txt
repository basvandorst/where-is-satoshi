You really think you can tell me what I know and don't know? You don't know me. Fool. I understand they can be bought. Go ahead and invest and let me know a year from now how much you sold them for, and how much profit you made after taxes and fees. I'd also like to know how long after listing it took to sell, and the market price and your listing price.

I've researched Bitcoin, read about how it works. Buy your hardware and let me know how much money you made a year from now. Write down my username and send me a message.

Too bad you'll never get that $10,000 because you'll never be able to sell the bitcoins you mine for $10,000. Making money off Bitcoin is worse than all of the "get rich quick" scams that have swept through the country over the past few decades. Just like all the other get rich quick scams, the rich get richer and the people that fall for it get duped out of their money. In this case the rich want us to invest money into buying Bitcoin mining hardware and think we can mine a bunch of virtual money that we can materialize, which in actuality will never materialize. Don't believe it until your friend or neighbor shows you their checking account quadrupling every week. 
Edit: I'm getting a strong feeling this post is filled with investors trying to make a few bucks off others, and potentially people who have bought into Bitcoin and are now stuck with an investment they are having trouble cashing in on. The best way for anyone to make money back on the market is to get a bunch of unsuspecting optimistic folk to purchase other people's failed investment. If you're new to reading about Bitcoin take my advice and heavily research it before investing. Research the cons of Bitcoin and make an educated decision before throwing your money at it. Don't let downvotes convince you of anything; Bitcoin is a get rich quick hysteria that the world's most prominent investors have spoken about for a long time. I'm trying to save some of you from throwing your money away because not everyone is going to make money. Just like any get rich quick scheme, some people make it while a lot of people don't. You never know if the people replying to you online are scam artists or normal investors telling the truth about a good investment. All these people replying to me sound like investors in Bitcoin, so don't learn from them because Bitcoin investors are biased. They will defend their investment. Learn about Bitcoin from people that aren't invested in it because they have nothing to lose and with no commitment to an investment they are an unbiased source. Be careful who you learn from.

"we've" ... Now I know why you all are here. A bunch of investors recruiting people online to buy buy buy so that yours can sell sell sell. I'm getting ready for bed. I have many paragraphs of words I want to respond to you but I just don't have the time. My original comment was not for the investors, but the uneducated folk that end up losing money just like all the people that don't know how to play the stock market. I've made lots of money on the stock market but that's because I know what I'm doing. My uncle lost a lot of money on the stock market by not knowing what he was doing and just trusting people like you who have been doing it for years and know what they're doing. Don't you realize how many people lose money by listening to those that know what they're doing? Because they think "if this guy can do it so can I" and they're wrong because they have no idea. My original comment was to warn people. Those that know what they're doing are going to make money off it but those that don't are screwed over by all these people in the comments acting like it's the road to heaven.

I am serious. Please, tell your smart phone AI (like Apple's Siri) "remind me one year from today to let Reddit user f-a-i-t-h-a-l-o-r (spell it for the AI) know how my bank account is doing after trying to sell my bitcoins." I would love to know.

No because this post is recruiting new investors, which is who my original comment was made for. [Invest now and let me know how it goes later] is what I'm requesting, detailed in the previous comments above this. I'm really not trying to be hostile but I've had very close friends and family lose so much money from not knowing what they're doing that that's why I'm warning others. Bitcoin is not for those who don't know what they're doing. People that see this post are going to get excited and go out and try to get some bitcoins and lose a lot of money, and I'm trying to keep them from doing that. And the people that do know what they're doing aren't going to listen to me and they will make money. But even those that know what they're doing lose a lot of money. Look at Trump and how many billions of dollars he lost and yet he obviously knows what he's doing because he made billions back again. But that doesn't change the fact that he still lost billions to begin with. I can't even imagine how many people are losing money by buying into the Bitcoin hysteria. People like my uncle and some friends. These are other people's family losing money too because they buy into the hysteria not knowing what they're doing. If you're one of the ones that do know what you're doing then great, but I want you to invest now like a newbie and let me know the details a year from now after selling. I want you to be in their shoes-- all those that see this post and buy into it right now and sell later.

If you would fulfill my request a year from today I would greatly appreciate it
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:44
Write down my username and send me a message a year from now about how much money you made. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:53:13
You're only seeing 4 comments of a long thread. Read my responses to others in this post. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:11:59
The whole thread was me saying Not to buy and then everyone bitching about it. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:17:08
Because the screenshot only shows 4 comments of a very long thread. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:27:57
Read the whole thread not just the screenshot. It's a long thread and the screenshot only shows 4 comments, one of which I predicted that investing in Bitcoin now would be a bad idea considering where it would be a year later, as evident in my screenshot of the 1 year timeline. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:45:58
Actually you sound like the tool here. You weren't part of the thread and you think you know what it discussed and are standing by your ignorance rather than becoming informed. Try doing some research for a change before whiping your dick out. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:04:47
Read the full discussion; they were recommending to buy
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:07:32
No; i make much easier money investing in other markets. Less risk and much higher reward than Bitcoin.
