I hate to paint with a broad brush here, but generally speaking every single person can plan and create a budget.  People just... don't.
Emergencies happen, of course.  But regular overdrafting because of poor practices isn't on the banks.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:34:30
So edgy!
This will certainly help make Bitcoin look more legit, well done.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:40:33
That's an option you can select.
People don't.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:57
Sure it is, sure it is.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:38:45
Poor planning isn't the bank's fault.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:12:31
Or, maybe, you know just wait and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:19:17
Whoops, under 14k.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:52:31
You're exactly right - everybody and their Granny is talking about what a disaster Bitcoin is.  Whether that's true or not, that's the public perception right now.
The only thing that pushed this to 20k was the public hype.  That hype is long, long gone.
I made my money, I left near the ATH, full disclosure.  So I don't have a horse in the race at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:17:20
You have absolutely no evidence to support this besides your hopes and dreams.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:54:45
This mentality is great for the memes, but if you're interested in actually making real money from this whole experience you'll need to pick your exit point.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:26:56
Could also crash dramatically while sleeping.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:46:24
Yuh huh, totally. Totally a sale.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:55:30
If you're not buying or selling, why are you guys so obsessed with the price?
An unrealized gain is just that... unrealized.  You haven't actually made anything.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:18:08
The difference, in my mind, is that the guy I'm talking to is potentially convincing people who cannot afford to be this risky with their money to gamble away their savings. BTC increasing in value is anything but a certainty, and I take issue with people parading around claiming it is.
I dipped my toes into BTC and LTC last week, I'm riding the wave with the rest of you all. But I'm not kidding myself into thinking this is a safe bet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:57:20
If only this was true.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:09
Just give it time
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:03:25
Never did I say I'm unbiased.  Learn to read context clues.  I don't have any invested capital in Bitcoin anymore, so I don't honestly care if it goes up and down at this point. 
However, I'm clearly biased against the 'product'.  I don't believe in BTC, at all, and I think this thing goes &lt;$5000 in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:11:58
BTC isn't for you.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:30:52
Probably, yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:13:18
Of course they don't lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:59:14
The hoops you guys jump through...
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:36:53
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:40:14
It is absolutely a commodity.
Well, no. It isn't. It's currently pretending to be a commodity. A commodity actually possesses real value.
BTC does not, and will not for a long, long time.. if ever.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:12:55
I would be very hesitant personally to bring my well-into-retirement-age family members into this.. unless he's very well off otherwise, I'd be very afraid to tell him to put his savings into this.
It's a hell of a gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:38:13
What history?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:30:52
What on Earth about this faux commodity seems invincible to you?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:18:48
There's absolutely no logic here behind your side, but like I said - if it helps you sleep at night, then power to you.
But I wholeheartedly and vehemently disagree with this. And I feel it's incredibly dangerous to post things like this with certainty because of the influence you'll inevitably have on some poor saps.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:57:29
Is this for the memes, or are you guys actually this misinformed?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:19:27
Go check the daily convo thread.
Did you just use noob unironically? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:12:28
BTC could go to zero tomorrow. Like literally tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:06:58
Just wait until the hype dies down..
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:19:53
Go check the daily thread from yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:47:55
But but but it's a safe nonregulated currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:03:46
...the fuck...?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:09:11
This thing WILL go to zero at some point.
Just hope the memers time it right.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:07:47
You have absolutely no clue whether that's true or not.
Don't pretend to speak with confidence on this.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:03:58
Holy crap we have people justifying gambling by pointing to the recession.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:35:08
I don't understand why you guys are constantly checking the price if you're going to "hodl" anyway.
You're not looking to sell, so who the fuck cares what it does on a day-to-day basis?
Bunch of novice investors here, dangerous.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:04:44
I think it's a large product of the hype machine.
People are now pouring money into this.. once that settles down, who knows where it'll end up.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:04:21
Why on earth are you at all certain that the cost going back up is a sure thing?
And please, please, please don't point to six years of history as "proof".
All indications point to this thing stabilizing &lt;10k at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:12:03
Don't let your opinions blind you there bud.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:48:06
People here really jump through hoops to try and make themselves feel better about bitcoin.
This sub is like a giant "safe space" at times.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:08:48
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:15:58
Endless exponential growth is a truly rare thing.
Hope it gets there, my feet are in the water too, but I just hope people are sensible about it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:47:05
If it was that easy we'd all be rich, guy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:47:14
Do tell how you came to this conclusion.
90% is awfully certain.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:28:01
Lol whoops..
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:04
Nothing increases indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:07:55
It's a literal gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:24:06
If you're coming here looking for investing advice... You're doing it wrong.
This sub is filled with a ton of wide-eyed novice "investors" who believe that, hey since it skyrocketed once it'll definitely happen again so hold on until then!! 
When in reality, this could very well crash to $1000 in a week.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:56:49
If it goes back up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:48:12
I mean, if that makes you feel better sure you can believe that.
Economic history has taught us otherwise though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:28:11
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:49:25
You're going to borrow money to gamble.
Is this really a question?
Your girlfriend is a fucking idiot for suggesting such a thing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:03:36
Don't agree with this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:24:50
Smh with this "buy more" mentality.
It's like a bunch of you just want to drag people down with you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:16:59
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:26:46
So is this one of those posts where the OP is going to ignore the replies that completely destroy his supposed points?
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:50:07
This is a pretty lame shitpost.
Is this sub on the way to becoming as useless as @_date: 2017-12-07 02:11:16
I mean for me, I'm trying to remain 15% crypto relative to the rest of my stocks/bonds/REITs.
Full crypto portfolio, I don't have any advice for.  I wouldn't personally have the stomach for it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:52:13
God damn people are so fucking shitty.
Hope it comes down on them, hard. That's fraud and they should treated as such.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:16:52
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:34:14
Oh my God try and not be "that bitcoin guy".  You're doing yourself an incredible disservice. 
I don't know, I have my opinions though.  But OP is asking for advice, and you phrased your answer in a definitive way that doesn't convey an opinion.  You're stating your opinion as a fact, which is misleading.
You can be as "bullish" as you want, but don't drag other people down with you.


Go ahead and explain to me, exactly, what this has to do with anything.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:30:15
Are people this desperate, honestly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:01:09
Yuh huh.
I personally don't buy into the whole "USD is going to collapse and society will function solely off this this cryptocurrency" stuff, but to each their own I suppose.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:16:29
Give it a few days
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:18:03
People contesting charges/transactions they willingly and knowingly made to try and save their own asses?
Are you kidding me?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:08:35
I'd say if it hits 20k I'll all-but-completely exit for my peace of mind.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:14:56
This mentality is a cancer.
This faux commodity has proven nothing, and, of course, past performance isn't indicative of future returns.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:03:19
It really isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:33:34
You guys are fucking insane if you think this bubble doesn't burst within the next 6 months.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:50:22
Yeah it totally doesn't have anything to do with the drop in price since you bought in lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:48:53
Just like 15k was the support right?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:28:17
Hey there - just understand you haven't had a single profit if you haven't sold yet.
Rookie stuff here. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:28:28
Lucky price break lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:20:45
Well you successfully b8ed me so pretty well I'd say
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:06:21
Sell off and rebalance.
Same as you'd do with a standard portfolio.
Unless you're one of those "HODL huehuehue" people
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:04:20
It's fraud, it's theft, and it's illegal.
You'll figure it out when you get older.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:24:13
The greater goal here for 99% of people is to make money. Real money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:48:14
Past performance isn't indicative of future returns.
Investing 101.
Just because it happened before doesn't mean it'll be likely to happen again.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:38:32
Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future gains/losses.
Learn this phrase, friend.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:12:30
Who's to say when a dip ends though? People would buy on a dip with the (dangerous) assumption that a rebound is inevitable.
Would you buy if this thing starts to snowball tomorrow workout an end in sight?
I'm sure you say you would as we sit here with it increasing. But people are fickle and panic.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:32:19
What the hell accepts Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:37:19
So... Because you were too foolish to invest in the stock market over the past year+ and miss out on the massive gains...
....it's okay to potentially lose it all gambling on BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:11:38
Why wouldn't you wait out this weekend to see how the market reacts to futures trading...
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:33:12
Excitement? What excitement...
You've completely lost the casual investor at this point.
BTC and other cryptos are a disaster to the layman at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:32:31
But this is what you're dealing with in this sub.  This type of misinformation.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:18:40
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:35:37
Try: The reality is that BTC is dying.
But this sub pumps it up to try and desperately keep hope alive.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:00:36
Holy smokes the delusion.
So you're saying because it's up 1000% over the past year, it'll be up 1000% by end of year 2018?
Good luck man, if believing this makes you feel better about your gamble then power to you.
It is absolutely, 100% a gamble. Considering it otherwise doesn't make you informed. I'd go so far as to argue it makes you look less informed...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:00:51
Another delusional person.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:15:42
It's almost as if this is cyclical or something.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:46:53
Give it a week and that'll be a bargain for the seller.
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:34:38
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:26:00
Stock market is volatile so BTC price rises.
There seems to definitely be an inverse relationship going on.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:58:12
What, exactly, do you hope to achieve by long term holding on an asset that has no actual worth?
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:48:59
People see the stock market take a downturn and suddenly flock to alternate investments.
If/when the markets bounce back, I expect BTC will cool off.
Who the fuck honestly knows, though.
