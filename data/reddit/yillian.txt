Not even a little. That's the entire point. Gains are measured over time, so if you're down at the moment don't sell if you think the market will recover. Which it inevitably will if crypto has a place in the near future. It helps to stop thinking in days and instead think in months or even years to remember that these fluctuations are normal.

Here's some advice.  You have zero BTC in that wallet. End of story. Such a shame. It's probably why you forgot about it. So repeat after me, "I have ZERO bitcoin in that wallet."

Your entire premise rests on assuming all holders have the same sell price. That's just not the case. People come in and out at their own personal ATH ROI's. Added to that is the variance from those who use BTC as a store of wealth vs transactional currency vs investment mechanism.

I have an entire system! Incremental percentage based sales with a hard floor that will exist in perpetuity for crypto based transactions for the day that becomes the norm.

I think what you were looking for was this

In that case, stop thinking about it. Just leave it alone until you absolutely need it. I would wait until the day you have a kid to check back and decide whether or not to sell.

I'm a happy to have mastered the art of holding. I just don't check the price anymore and it makes my life so much easier. 
I suggest everyone do it if they're not actively moving crypto. Just pick one day a week to check up on the market, set a few buys in anticipation of dips and rises and just walk away until next week. My day is Friday night and so far so good.

Get ready for the LTC 100 and ETH 500 after parties too.

If you want to retire early in a major city it makes sense to buy your place so it can appreciate and be sold later. A studio in Manhattan goes for like 400k+. Yearly maintenance is an additional 10k. The yearly living expenses is probably in the 12 - 20k range depending on how often you eat out and party etc. So that 30k a year plus 400k initial investment will take you out 20 years if you buckle down your budget, live alone, have no kids, no pets. Not too bad actually.

I was like that for a while. Until I just uninstalled all my mobile based tracking apps. No coinbase, no exchanges, no notifications. Nothing.
I have small recurring investments set up  and just check what the market is doing once a day, usually at night. if it looks like it's making big moves I'll keep an eye out to see if I should make some buys the next day.
I also set up a lump sum fund that I make regular contributions to and hold for major events. Like a monumental crash, incoming fork, or alt coin pump and dump. I love it because it helps me sleep at night knowing I have a good chunk of liquid cash on hand available to profit off a big event.

My best friends wife is actually in the fintech industry and doesn't want to invest... Think about that for a minute.

Psh... I just loaded up on all my alts. Set for the next few months. Hopefully now BTC dips hard after the fork so I can restock heavy at a discount.

Not everyone knows and not everyone that does makes the switch. I was using coinbase for over a month and only recently made the decision or took the time to get my GDAX setup and configured.

I would hope she'd sell enough to recoup his initial investment... then take that cash and just burn dollars in their faces like "fun coupons". Why, because she can. That's why. 
*Edit: I made an incorrect assumption. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:44:20
Yes, but people often wrongly equate DCA with a recurring investment schedule. Putting in 1k a month when you only have 1k cash on hand to invest is different then investing 1k a month when you have 10k cash on hand to invest. But that's not so intuitive for most people because common sense creeps up and asks what really is the difference between the two of at the end of the day if I was only ever going to invest 10k.

Make sure you set up all your accounts and wallets now! They take time to establish, and verify. Usually anywhere from 2 - 5 days.
Coinbase will limit deposits to 500 on credit and 5000 on bank transfers. The transfers take a week to clear. Call or email your bank once you're ready to start transferring and let them know that you pre-authorized this and not to stop it.
Get set up on the major exchanges in to have some liquidity in case you want to invest a few shekels on a speculative crypto currency. This also takes roughly 2-5 days so again, do it in advance.
Lastly, if you can afford it, buy a ledger s nano and a trezor or just a ledger if money is tight. I keep my BTC, ETH and LTC on my Trezor and all my alts on ledger. This is the wine cellar in which your crypto will age gracefully. Deposit and do not withdraw until 2022.
