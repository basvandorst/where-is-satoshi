Hi ! Thanks for this guide. The following are my suggestions which I think would improve your guide:
- The last command is 'send' not 'spend'.
- I think it would be worthwhile to mention somewhere that bitcoind rpcpassword and the eclair password must not contain spaces or quotation marks (single or double). I spent an evening only fighting this.
- oracle-java8-jdk is not available in some Linux distributions. Also, openjdk-9-jre does not work with eclair due to a known bug, so people should use openjdk-8-jre.
Well done! And thanks again.

Can somebody please explain the following: when withdrawing from an exchange which supports Segwit - in order to initiate a Segwit transaction - do I need to specify a p2sh address or will a legacy address also do the trick?

Thanks! That looks great! Regarding the java requirement - yes, of course - do not change oracle-java8-jdk as that is important for the pi platform. However, I suspect many will use your guide to install eclair on different Linux distributions (like I did) and will notice that on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS, for example, there's no oracle-java8-jdk. There's only openjdk-8-jre and openjdk-9-jre. The later does not work due to this [bug]( Perhaps you can put a parentheses somewhere saying: "(use openjdk-8-jre if oracle-java8-jre is not available on your platform)".

Is there an exchange that supports bech32? I use Kraken and I dont think they support bech32, or do they?

Thank you. I see now. So how do I create p2sh addresses? Electrum gives me either legacy or bech32 addresses. Do I have to use Bitcoin Core for this?

Notice how the slope of the linear regression on the log plot for each cycle is decreasing. It suggests that the exponential growth rate is slowing down with each iteration.

I got back from Cuba yesterday. You have access to internet there. I was watching the price every day.
