Venezuela and South America in general (thanks to Venezuelan refugees) is seeing a BOOM in crypto usage. 
Specifically with Bitcoin and with Dash.
It is an outlet for people to have some sort of savings and to hedge against rampant inflation of their local currency with little restriction. 
Electricity is an issue right now there, almost half the population without power. It’s an issue. For sure. Those that can will use generators to recharge their devices and maybe obtain some form of cellular service. 
In the future this will be rectified by constellation satellite networks that beam down broadband internet. (Functional early 2020s)

A 51% attack is a brute force override. So hashing power of over half the networks total, regardless of the total number of nodes. 
The node that gets the next block hashed onto the chain claims the longest version, meaning the latest and as such can potentially add false transactions to the chain.

You could use a BTM but it’ll cost you a higher % to do so. You’d first need to set up a wallet (bitcoin address) to do so. 
Look for some top exchanges that accept fiat from a bank (that allows transfers to a crypto exchange). 
A great guide for crypto world in general is here:

Well that’s one of its features. 
It’s more fungible than even gold. 
The market determines the value of 1 bitcoin, that value can be subdivided by 100,000,000 (1 Satoshi). 
Regardless of what the smallest unit is worth, the amount you own corresponds to how much it’s worth comparatively.

I don’t see any other region with the growth rates in transactions in Bitcoin’s as SA.

It’s incredible how people will trash someone’s hard work as useless yet have done ZERO to contribute to the adoption of cryptocurrency. Somehow ONLY Bitcoin can be used as a means to exchange value electronically, it’s beyond stubbornly ignorant. 
BTC is a settlement layer, not a micropayments one. People will adopt based on utility and use, that means there will be dozens of block chains, thousands of tokens, and millions of digital assets. 
BAT is one of the favorites to be adopted.

It already has a name DeFi. A large ecosystem is being built around crypto using various assets. 
Right now it’s mainly with ETH and DAI. This is where smart-contracts shine and why there is room for many digital assets. 
BTC itself will become the reserve asset of the crypto ecosystem. Through atomic swaps and “wrapping,” Bitcoin will be exchanged and loaned out through similar smart contracts where only the protocol will act as the middle man. It is and will be trustless. 
WBTC already exists thanks to Ethereum and the Kyber network. 
Today you can quite easily take out a loan or lend out your assets through Dharma’s Lever. Again, Ethereum based.

I would take the time to really LEARN about crypto. Take a step now to have skin in the game. But take the time. 
This is the equivalent of being an early adopter of the internet in the mid 90s. 
I recommend visiting Jameson Lopp’s site. 
Reading the Bitcoin Standard by Ammous. 
Watching keynote presentations by Tom Lee. 
Listening to podcasts featuring Antonopolous. 
Visiting localbitcoins.com to see how global this is all really is and trends by region. 
This is a journey down the rabbit hole. It will captivate you with every step.

Meh. Take a zero off of that and I’ll believe it. 
Tom is fantastic in his macro analysis but the chart form bitcoin is rather clear mathematically from its inception.

Unless you're account reaches stratospheric levels, i would recommend simply keeping most if not
all in Gemini. They backup the value of ALL of their assets.
When you use a hardware wallet or paper wallet, the onus is on YOU. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:07:37
No they have custodial insurance for all their crypto. 
I’m not sure of any other exchange that provides that but all my BTC holdings are with them. 
I will look into a hardware wallet once my holdings gain big enough heft, just to diversify how I’m hodling. All my alts are either on binance or in a metamask wallet.

You would have to understand total purchasing power.
The world's currencies in circulation are in the trillions of $, to match that level BTC would need to be priced much higher. Only .5% of the global population is estimated to own any crypto, almost no institutional investors, imagine the value of 1 BTC if billions of people vs \~25-50m had an interest in owning it.
At $20,000 the total value of the BTC network reached $250B, that's nowhere near the global money supply of 10s of trillions of USD.
@_date: 2019-01-21 05:10:23
better off getting an altcoin for that amount. 
BTC is simply not a super value play anymore in four digits territory.
Use those $25 to learn about how the blockchain economy works instead. If you get into ETH, you can use Metamask on your browser to buy crypto collectibles or even take out a loan/trade on margin. 
Then when youre ready, put in a sizeable amount and apply your learnings from the $25 original investment.
Up to you in the end.

What a brilliant exercise in contrarian plays. 
Nearly every prediction had $20k+
@_date: 2018-12-22 15:43:34
I would wait on the presumption. 
The drop from $6k lagged the drop in S&amp;P by a few weeks. People were saying the same thing. 
Now, at that time no one expected the BCH hash war to have that much impact on BTC so hard to say if the drop from $6k was lag to market volatility returning or more so due to BCH fork.

It’s clearly a better “form” of money.

That’s exactly what I’m expecting after larger company (Fortune 500) adoption. 
Small national central banks will start hedging with it. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:47:57
People need to stop looking at absolute numbers and start looking at relative ones. 
Gold alone is worth $7.2T. 
Crypto is to be the internet of money. 
So naturally $7.2T will be only a portion of the total worth in years to come. 
Tim Draper estimates 2/3 of all money will be crypto based in coming decades, that’s likely $100T/$150T of what global value will be once global money transfer becomes de-frictioned so to say. 
$20k is but a drop in the bucket if Bitcoin captures a similar percent to total as it has now in crypto.
