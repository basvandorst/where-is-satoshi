Here’s my offer on the topic,   
Quantum computers exploit the quantum state, a subatomic level where literally anything can happen, Any data processed in this space is called quantum data, and is represented in its rawest form as a Qubit. Rather than a regular bit strictly respreseting a 1 or 0, a Qubit is able to be both at the same time, or neither, or anything it wants. This state of respresenting two or more possible values is called superposition. 
Now, when something is in superposition, it’s outside the constricts of time and space and can therefore transcend both. That’s not a joke.
So to link back to the theory...it’s a stretch, but the idea is that this block hash is quantum data that was relayed as a “quantum handshake” from an AI in the future. Yeah...

I know this is a joke but damn that would be pretty fuckin awesome.

Well that’s the trick isn’t it? Completely hacker-proof software isn’t really a thing yet. Especially when there’s whole governments who sanction/fund black hat operations.

Maybe even longer, even if that’s the case, I have no problems holding till then, and neither should you. 
The 2020’s are going to be a very interesting decade for technology. VR worlds, colonization and industrialization in space, advancements in AI and quantum computation. These are all things that cryptocurrencies can and will play a direct role in.

Electroneum? That’s not a recommendation. CPU mining sucks. But I am mining it on like three of my shitty old Androids. Supposedly I’ll make 25 bucks if I wait a year.

Good lord what abysmal journalistic standards. 
Nothing cited, nothing to back up, just some guy going, “it’s a ponzi scamses Gais!”
