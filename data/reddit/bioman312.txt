Thank you. This is the kind of shit that you saw on back in the day.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:35:47
Nah only dogecoin
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:32:15
Mainly, the mods know that they (and those that agree with them) will be downvoted by most people on this sub. So they defaulted this thread to controversial to make those posts show up first.

Not if you want grant money

I've never understood why reddit is so completely hung up with the idea that good or bad news about Bitcoin could directly influence the price. Bitcoin markets are only really influenced by one thing: extremely rich people.
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:09:27
Still relevant
@_date: 2015-05-11 23:26:52
I bet you could probably argue that it used to be like that, causing the big pattern that we all saw in Bitcoin in 2013-14, but then now people are starting to see a lot of practical applications for Bitcoin and the blockchain now that the ship has sailed for the "get rich off Bitcoin" idea, and that's why it hasn't gone completely worthless. Feel free to correct me on this, though; I am not an economist.

Can someone ELI5 what the big change here is? If I understand correctly, you can already buy/sell BTC on Coinbase. Is this going to allow more methods of payment (i.e. other than linking a major bank account)? Does it just give legitimacy to what's already there?
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:29:17
And in different slots? 
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:23:31
something something good news something something price drop

Sounds like he took one programming class and latched onto the anti-Java bandwagon lol

@_date: 2015-08-18 22:51:36
Done, thanks! 
Edit: [The admins' response]( 
I guess we just go the route of the XKCD subreddit and just make sure everyone knows that the current moderation isn't adequate and there's a much better sub elsewhere? 
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:36:04
...Except they were the ones who implemented this, most likely with the intention of hiding the amount of comments that were being deleted by them.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:28:49


How is shifting difficulty not preventing this?
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:43:39
Nah, it won't be deleted. It's not in support of BitcoinXT, and it comes from the head mod's group of "experts" (read: supporters).

@_date: 2017-11-12 20:19:36
Ah, thanks!
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:35:31
I messaged them and got the basic response of "if you don't like it, go somewhere else."
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:33:14
They don't want to be seen as the site that supports CP sites and such. Although Voat obviously isn't a CP site, they may be reported repeatedly as one by people who want Voat gone. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:07:49
Bingo. It'll hit an equilibrium.

Look, Vegeta! *The locals!*
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:29:40
A couple corrections:
* There have been some issues with the open moderation system, although I'm not exactly sure of the specifics. IIRC it is currently unavailable for all subverses.
* After pressure from vague legal / corporate sources, the Voat admin has deleted a few subverses, the legalities of which were in question.

The tone on this sub changed drastically when head mods started to remove pro-hard fork opinions as "not being about Bitcoin". Before that, believe it or not, this sub was overwhelmingly in support of the hard fork that would later become Bitcoin Cash, and made fun of Lightning supports the way we now make fun of BCH supporters.
Along with the change towards hating BCH, came a focus on Bitcoin as a storage of value, not a currency. Because that's really what the decision to not hard-fork was based on: People wanted BTC to be a storage of value, and were okay with transfers costing more and taking longer if it meant the price went up. 
Now, we've since largely recovered from the worst of long/expensive transactions, but the sentiment still sticks that using Bitcoin as a currency isn't that important anymore. Discussion is almost 100% about the price, and honestly you don't see the same kind of shitposts and memes about "Are you saying I can sell this for a million dollars? - No, I'm saying that when you're ready, you won't have to".
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:26:39
I'd like to get something like this, and act all interested, and when they ask for my password, just matter-of-factly respond "four".
And just play with that as long as possible
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:14:12
I mean, it's doubled infinitely many times from when it was literally worthless.
This argument isn't even an argument

It's worthless if no people at the time are willing to pay money for it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:13:35
That's the joke.
Well at least for this guy's sake I hope it is.

I understand if this would get buried for obvious reasons, but is there any demand for me to try to get a "Dogecoin4Bitcoin" thing going on in @_date: 2015-04-27 01:55:31
Thank you very much!

It does, but people on don't want to admit that, silly!
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:21:24
Exactly. And if they did, they'd be accused of spreading fud and downvoted into oblivion.
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:51:00
Yes, but it's not grounds to take any action against it. Imagine if the government tried to shut down the internet (disregarding the fact that this is pretty much impossible) because of the fact that it helps people to do illegal things. It would completely nullify anything good that the internet has done for the world. The same applies to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:22:38
The joke doesn't really work well with this because the point of crypto mining is to use a ton of resources. The entire point of the joke is to use it for some software that SHOULDN'T use all your resources, but does anyway, like Chrome or something.
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:25:34
Apparently it works on reddit.

Important to note that he didn't get popular from the self-help stuff. He got popular by being anti-trans, and the book became a talking point for "Well here's why I REALLY like him".
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:40:10
That's also an issue, tbh. People have basically internalized "padlock = good" and are falling for Let's Encrypt-signed scams all the time.
