Worse: The shop had apparently chosen 1-conf security through their Bitpay dashboard but their website was setup incorrectly to handle "paid" notifications as if they were "confirmed" notifications. A cautionary tale worthy of exposure.

Hi there,
Bitcoin Core can take a long time to synchronize and be usable. It's also best if you keep it running 24/7 or at least once every few days. However, it has the advantage of being more trustless and private. Even if you buy predominately online, a mobile wallet is useful to have. It's very quick to scan QR codes shown on your PC screen. 
I would go ahead and start installing Core just to become familiar with it, but get Copay or Airbitz as well on mobile for immediate use. Then, if you decide you want to use Core later you can transfer funds to it.
A mobile wallet is highly useful for buying at an ATM, but not strictly necessary. Some machines (like Genesis Coin) do generate paper wallets for you to import into another wallet later. Even if your ATM didn't have that option, you could print out your own public address QR code at home to scan at the machine.
Visit coinatmradar.com for a map of nearby machines and compare them to find the lowest fees. Alternatively, buy from Coinbase, Circle, or Gildera online for significantly less fees (but, often, less privacy and much slower). ...or try LocalBitcoins, Mycelium Trader, or Paxful for other options.

Look into CoinSimple.com. They offer payment processing without touching your coins via HD public seeds. They also offer dynamic addressing on the front end for static addresses on the back end, automatically forwarding your bitcoin receipts into your own address from any wallet. They will also integrate with major exchanges if desired.
@_date: 2016-08-01 14:45:45
Yep, CoinSimple.com is designed to do that with little setup. Alternatively, you could use a wallet like Airbitz that will export a well designed payment request to an email app, or any wallet that will allow copying of the basic payment request URI that you can paste into your own invoice form.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:23:37
Just offhand, I'd say 6-9" long with a QR code and name big enough to read and scan comfortably. We should be able to slip some folded paper into the top. BTW, is the inner chamber designed to open?
Also, is the code and name laser cut or wood burned or applied in some other way?
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:37:18
StartJoin.com seems to be the best Bitcoin-integrated crowdfunding platform we have right now. Backers can fund with PayPal or Bitcoin over there, but they need an account (just like Indiegogo). Fee is 5% plus PayPal fees if applicable. Haven't tried it myself, though. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 12:39:24
Lovely, Kyle. What's the dimensions of it, though? Is there a way to contribute / buy via Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-04-23 00:28:59
Perhaps CoinSimple.com? It's a merchant services company that utilizes xpub keys for direct 100% BTC e-commerce payment processing and will connect to other merchant services APIs if needed. You can then use Stripe for all other payment forms within the same site / shopping cart. Some work to find the right combination of plugins / buttons, but this may be your best solution. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 15:22:41
Actually, that's pretty cool! Single address invoice creation (with on-visit pricing) without an account, or xpub import for dynamic addressing with account creation for several popular wallets. Thanks for the callout!

Exactly. As much as I'm willing to praise von NotHaus for one of the most successful attempts at a private currency, pre-Bitcoin, his equivocal use of the term "dollars" and symbology while encouraging face value exchange mearly led to both confusion and fraud. Cashiers were getting offered $20 ALD to pay off $20 in USD debt., for example. It's fine if a business owner wanted to trade some amount of goods or services for ALD, but not when a mere employee gets tricked into thinking there is no difference.
I had a friend who worked for Walgreens when someone payed a $20 ALD certificate in place of a $20 bill. Walgreens couldn't do anything with it so they essentially were scammed, but my friend acquired this item and sold it to me. I am proud to keep it as a artifact in the turbulent history of money. :)
@_date: 2015-12-22 14:46:26
Useful writeup, but I don't necessarily agree with the conclusion. Zero-conf is risky, but manageable. It's an entrepreneurial and technical challenge to come up with ways for merchants-as-clients (of, e.g., BitPay, BlockCypher) to accept zero-conf with reasonable certainty. We shouldn't just eliminate zero-conf for everyone when it is successfully utilized today.
That being said, if a strong enough case can be made for the other advantages of RBF (and newbie mistake recovery isn't enough, in my opinion), then Opt-in RBF (&lt; max value nSequence) will adequately preserve existing zero-conf utilization once we get through a potentially hazardous transition period for a minority of merchants.
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:15:50
Is this the first location?
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:02:59
One upvote @_date: 2015-12-23 14:42:11
Keep in mind that whatever POS solution a merchant is using, it *should* be updated to detect Opt-in RBF and either automatically reject it or provide that as an option. The majority of businesses using BitPay or Coinbase will probably not have to worry much about it since those PSPs should be all over this before 0.12 is actually released. Other PSPs and even regular wallet developers should, likewise, make RBF detection and UX alert / rejection a priority.
Not only is there a scam risk placed on those merchants who don't upgrade in time, but everyone else will likely deal with the odd rejection now and then from some bitcoin user who doesn't know better. This may make Bitcoin, overall, seem less reliable.
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:19:32
There are third-party companies that will enable you to generate dynamic addresses on a donation page (usually through I-frames or hosted checkout buttons) but *without* requiring them to touch your received bitcoin. Coinkite was already mentioned. CoinSimple does this, too.
Mycelium Gear allows you to do this (potentially) without a third-party on your own server.
Regular Bitcoin PSPs like Coinbase and BitPay can auto-forward your donations to your own wallet address, so they're not so bad for donations, either. ...but if you're not looking for immediate conversion into fiat, I'd recommend one of the above solutions.
Finally, others are correct in saying that a static address (that you replace once you spend from it) is just a privacy leak, not a security risk.
@_date: 2015-12-23 14:29:39
That's an excellent clarification. Is there any blog or support post that describes BitPay's treatment of zero-conf, by chance? How about Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:05:19
Love this attempt! ...but was disappointed to see the Target discount drop from the advertised 10% to 3% on the Target buy page. Was even more disappointed when the calculated bitcoin payment amounts were actually 1.3% in my test just now.
I hope Fold can increase that, but congrats to the Airbitz team for an excellent upgrade anyway!
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:04:39
I really appreciate the well-produced video tutorial and interesting method for using Armory, but this seems to have only limited usefulness. Tails should give you a secure environment for generating your wallet and signing transactions, but so could any truly offline computer capable of running Armory. The online Armory installation will not benefit from Tails TOR integration. For physical attack vectors, the storage of the Armory installer needed each time may present another risk. I thought this method might be useful for people without a second, offline PC, but you'd have to generate the transaction, reboot into Tails, sign it, reboot into the main OS, and broadcast the transaction. Not exactly convenient! ;)
This should be a more convenient solution for a person with two risky internet-connected PCs who wishes to use one to sign a transaction generated by the other. In that case, very cool!! 
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:48:32
It seems to me BitPay doesn't want to go the app route right now; i.e., that checkout link IS their platform-independent mobile solution. I just noticed today that their new version of that checkout page is actually close to a native app in ease of use.

Nope, Walmart pulled their cards from eGifter back in November.
This is frustrating. Why does Target not have an issue with theirs? Yes, we have to bother a CSM at WM to manually enter the card number and that slows everything down. Does Target not require the same?

Thank you, Airbitz team, for what you're doing! The upcoming wallet has two really important advantages: An alternative library, and dynamic address generation. Never mind the fact that your business directory and apps are the best designed that the Bitcoin community has ever seen!

In addition, there are vinyl Bitcoin stickers with adhesive from cryptocoinstuff.com and reverse-printed (but not necessarily vinyl) stickers from cryptoanarchy.com and bitstickers.net. I've received orders from all of them.
We merchants could use more static-cling, reverse-printed Bitcoin sticker options, though.

CSMs are required for keyed (not swiped) gift card entry into their POS system. An unfortunate hassle for us e-gift card users.
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:13:38
The discount doesn't have to consume the entirety of the fee savings, unless the merchant wishes to do so to promote Bitcoin or encourage customers to switch (and lead to greater savings later on when the discount expires or is rolled back). This is no different than stores that offer discounts for paying in cash (even though cash is not, technically, costless), as merchants are prohibited in their processor contracts from charging a fee for credit card acceptance.

"Barcades" still seem to be popular. Around Denver we have two 1UP locations and two Dave &amp; Busters. Arcades can also refer to non-video gaming machines that are typically part of amusement parks and fairs. At Boss Stage Arcade we are trying something new with both video game machines and console systems. There's no alcohol and no need for quarters or tokens; it's just admission for all-day play. Therefore, we might be the first bitcoin-accepting arcade in existence. ;)

Yes, Blockonomics.co can do this if you open up a Wallet Watcher account (can be Guest/anonymous) and input the "master public key" / xpub seed into the Address Watcher screen. Then, the History page will give you a graphed transaction history up to 3 months out.

This is difficult because credit/debit cards can be charged back, defrauding the seller of their bitcoin. However, you may find some options on Paxful.com for a high cost (to accommodate the high risk).

Fantastic! People generally underestimate Airbitz' security model or, worse, mistake it for a web wallet. Far from being a bank, Airbitz enables private key generation and control that is secure enough to be used (at least briefly) on a rooted Android phone.
The biggest risk to the user is himself, but that doesn't mean the inexperienced have to settle for custodial solutions. Airbitz provides the optimal balance of protection across real-world risk factors.
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:55:36
At current levels, that transaction may confirm anywhere between now and another day from now. It's hard to say. Just keep in mind that the transaction will eventually confirm (most likely) or be dropped from the network after three days (barring rebroadcast). In the future, I'd recommend you download the newest version of Electrum (v2.7.18), make sure Dynamic fees is enabled in Preferences, and follow the slider recommendation for future estimated confirmation time.
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:05:34
Yeah, I know. You'd think it would have really taken off here, but not yet. If it wasn't for Menufy we might not even have a single restaurant in the Denver area.

Another vote for Airbitz, though Mycelium is faster to use and more capable in some ways. Bitpay/Copay is decent, as well; a bit slow, but capable of generating and joining multisig wallets.
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:16:00
Although temporarily risky, depending on the amount I would probably choose to use a mobile wallet to import the paper wallet and then send to the hardware wallet ASAP. Airbitz, Copay, and Mycelium can do this.
If you're really paranoid, you might want to setup an offline installation of Electrum or Armory or even Coinb.in and sign the transaction offline, then copy the raw transaction to an online device and send it from there. PLEASE test any of these options before using large amounts!!!
Otherwise, just keep your paper wallet. It's just as secure being stored as a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-20 03:34:47
Oh, there's software out there for it, especially for the determined. I've never really looked into how, but I could do it with coinb.in in a few minutes after sending a purposely low-fee original transaction. There are no doubt more sophisticated ways.
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:22:25
Same here. Also reported on Github:
Edit: Issues like this are why I recommend splitting funds across wallets just in case a bug or unavailable backend renders one inoperable. Of course, SPV wallets, Electrum, Airbitz should be more resilient on their backends, but still.
Anyone know of any other [Bitcore Wallet Service]( providers?
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:52:36
The current version of Electrum is 2.7.18. Please use this version if possible.
In Electrum, under Tools--&gt;Preferences there is a Fees tab where you should check to make sure "Use dynamic fees" is selected. Now when you go to send a transaction, you will have a slider you can move with estimates of how quickly the transaction will be confirmed into a block.

Anonymity is a matter of degrees and contexts. You can find many private wallets on iOS which don't require or even request your name or info, but the wallet's design may leak your addresses to a central server or a list of servers under other's control. That, combined with your IP address and personally-identifying info associated with your phone service may lead one or more actors to link those addresses to you.
In other words, anonymity isn't easy. Bitcoin wasn't designed to be anonymous, though future upgrades may help. You can protect your pseudonymity from regular people (friends, family) more easily than you can from more powerful actors. It depends on the risks you're willing to take how much effort you'd have to go through.
To answer your question more simply, though, Breadwallet or Airbitz will likely be good for you. Only use Airbitz on a rooted Android phone unless you know the in-and-outs of security on your replacement OS.
Most importantly, be prepared for risks of in-person trades (robbery) and don't conclude the meeting before your transaction has confirmed.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:55:17
No direct experience with the Nano S, but, yes, you can safely use it to send regular transactions (that is the advantage of a hardware wallet) and you can create multiple accounts on it (whether or not you can do 20 is determined by the wallet software).
Those multiple accounts will all be backed up by your master seed (24 words), so please store that secure from fire, flood, theft, and prying eyes. Anyone getting a hold or snapping a picture of that backup will be able to steal all the funds in all your accounts.
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:51:17
Oh boy, could this be a reaction to the high fees and transaction delays (and resulting increase in customer service requests)? Requiring Coinbase would enable free and instant transfers using Coinbase's internal ledger. Not necessarily a bad business move.

Airbitz is one of the best wallets in my opinion and the one I always recommend to newcomers. It's Edge Security design emulates a web account from a user's POV (user/pass login on any [approved] device), but remains a private, encrypted wallet with few attack vectors. It's design is friendly and helpful for new Bitcoiners and it includes many advanced features (though not as many as Mycelium, nor multisig like Copay). Airbitz also has the best merchant POS interface and invoicing capability of any standard wallet and a built-in merchant directory--one of the two best we have.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:29:35
Your exchange is going to cost you something to convert to USD. Coinbase is not the absolute least expensive, but is one of the least expensive amongst convenient options. GDAX, Kraken, Gemini and others might offer less, but you'll have to take into account the cost of transferring USD to your bank account--not all of these do free ACH.
Besides that, you have one Bitcoin P2P network transaction transferring bitcoin from your paper wallet to Coinbase (or other exchange). This will probably only be 10-30 cents but could be larger depending on how many transactions were used to fund your paper wallet.
Mycelium is a great choice not only because you can import the paper private key directly, saving on sweeping expense, but also because you can select a Low Priority fee rate and wait for confirmation to your exchange.
You seem to have the most efficient conversion plan already.

This has been a long-term issue with Coinbase. We speculate it is because they combine smaller spend requests into larger broadcast transactions to save on fees. Better to withdraw your money to a private wallet that will broadcast immediately (at the cost of you paying your own fees).

Your fee level is a bit low, but I would expect it to confirm within a day at that rate. You can use the ViaBTC transaction accelerator as well if you wish. Adding inputs or outputs to the transaction make it larger and, thus, more expensive, but it's the fee rate that matters for confirmation time.

Yes, but for those just speculating on the price or who otherwise have money locked up in investment accounts and subject to certain rules, a Bitcoin ETF permits them Bitcoin price exposure without the costs and learning curve of buying and holding directly. A much larger market can then "get into" Bitcoin. In theory, this is good for longer term adoption and price for those who do hold directly. For traders, this is great for short-term mania.
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:08:23
I would send a note of friendly complaint to the ATM operator, however you pretty much just need to wait. It will likely confirm in time.

Those wallets are compatible with BIP 39, which means you can recover your accounts on other compatible hardware and software wallets including Copay and Mycelium. NOTE: If you store altcoins (Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, etc.) on certain hardware wallets your keys will also be preserved with your backup, but it may not be as easy to recover these elsewhere.

Bitpay/Copay is a good mobile and desktop wallet, but should be used for shorter-term funds. For long term storage, a hardware wallet is the easiest, or with learning and practice, one or more paper wallets or an offline computer will suffice.

There is limited space in blocks for transactions, and transactions have been filling up the blocks. This results in an increase in the average fee level as people compete for limited space.
Only miners can confirm transactions and they have yet to agree upon a scaling solution. Individual nodes don't matter in this regard except, perhaps, to signal their owner's chosen scaling solution.
I'm not sure what the "invalid payment request" message means in Bitcoin Core without additional detail on what you're trying to do, but it sounds like you're trying to lookup your latest receive address (that hasn't been used) on blockchain.info. You'd have to use the address you originally received bitcoin to on blockchain.info to see it's current balance. Even if the funds were somehow moved/stolen, it would show the sending transaction(s) and not be empty.
Bitcoin Core needs to sync fully in order for it to display a final balance for your wallet.

Unfortunately, 10 satoshis/byte is an extremely low fee rate. You'll probably have to wait at least a day for it to confirm unless you use the ViaBTC transaction accelerator or spend the amount you received with a 100+ sat/byte fee.
Which BTM operator was this? You should contact them and legitimately complain about their low fee rate.

@_date: 2017-02-17 20:48:14
This is true, however you shouldn't even want to. The whole point of a hardware wallet is to store bitcoin with private keys (including master seeds) that will never touch an internet-connected device. Restoring another wallet into a hardware device is not much better than the software wallet you had before.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:53:30
An address is just the result of one public/private keypair. A wallet is what is commonly used to safely and conveniently generate and manage hundreds to a near infinite number of keypairs (addresses). Unless you're just looking to learn or experiment with the technical details, you should get a wallet to generate your first address.
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:36:10
I wouldn't wait, but just start buying slowly over months for dollar cost averaging. Make sure you have thought out your storage plan to suit the amount your wish to hold. Always make secure backups. Practice with small amounts between wallets to get a feel for how transactions work. Nobody really knows what will happen to the price in the short term. If they do, they're trading it and not telling us.

Multisig, passwords written down in vaults you intend for someone to recover, or even master seeds split multiple ways so only when those individuals combine their knowledge can they reveal the full seed (not necessarily wise, just an option).

Hmm, no experience with the standalone version of Electrum, but my standard 2.7.18 prevents my older version from running entirely. As expected, though, version upgrades know to look for the existing wallet files in the user directory. As long as you have your master seed backup you should be good.
As for Multibit, if that is truly the maximum fee then I would go ahead and try to empty it. The transaction will either confirm or won't, but at that rate I bet it will confirm overnight.

Well, the second transaction has confirmed and the first may take several hours (unless to use the ViaBTC accelerator).
I'm not sure what you're trying to say by "double spent", however when you repaired the wallet it probably wiped any unbroadcasted transaction you may have had pending, and it may also take a while to recognize the unconfirmed (first) transaction you posted.

**You won't lose money!** It's important to realize that Bitcoin transactions are atomic, meaning they either succeed or they fail; the bitcoin is *either* in your wallet *or* in the recepient's wallet.
Unfortunately, Bitcoin cannot currently scale to support a greater number of transactions, so people are increasing fees to bid for space in a limited block. This means that if you send too low a fee (relative to current conditions) you may have to wait hours or a few days for the transaction to confirm. *While* you are waiting the coins used as an input to the transaction will not be available to you to spend elsewhere. Very inconvenient, I know, but not dangerous.
You can see the current recommended fee rate and fee level wait times at

Congrats on accepting Bitcoin! Let us know if you need any help with your integration. Also, post a photo of your new sticker/cling once you get it up! :)
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:12:32
It shouldn't be any different than other types of businesses in terms of integration, although I wouldn't be aware of any payment-related regulations you might be subject to. You'll most likely use a mobile phone or tablet to generate payment requests for customers after the total is rung up on your existing POS system. You'll then have to mark the transaction as paid in your existing POS, preferably using an "Other" option with a note about Bitcoin.
To be successful, make sure you advertise your Bitcoin acceptance via a sticker at the register, a cling on your door, and inclusion of the Bitcoin message in any advertisements you may run. Also be sure to add your business to the CoinMap.org and the Airbitz.co merchant directories. If there is a local Bitcoin interest group, FB group, or meetup nearby, please let them know!
If you need any help with the technical integration, just ask! :)
@_date: 2017-02-20 00:16:13
If you don't have experience with this I would recommend using a wallet that provides fee recommendations on its own. Most popular mobile and desktop wallets do this anymore. Use the "high" fee level for the fastest confirmation.
Otherwise, check [bitcoinfees.21.co]( for a guide to the current delays by fee level with a recommendation of its own.
XBT and BTC are largely equivalent terms.

No, there is no way to delete it from your old phone, however, you can simply create a new wallet on your current phone (use Airbitz or Breadwallet) and transfer all the funds to your new wallet address. Then there will be nothing to grab from the old phone.
If you still wish to continue using Mycelium on iOS you could uninstall it after transferring (above), reinstall it--creating a new wallet, and then send some or all of the bitcoin back to Mycelium.
Make sure you have backups of any new wallets you create.

Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium (at least on Android), Blockchain, and Electrum can all do multiple accounts. Only Airbitz, Mycelium, and Blockchain will back them all up by the same master seed (or user/pass). Breadwallet doesn't appear to be designed for multiple accounts.

There are several wallets with web access; some are custodial (e.g., Coinbase) and some are not (e.g., BitGo, Blockchain, Rushwallet, Coinb.in). However, I would consider the following:
1. You can restore access to your Blockchain.info wallet using the "More Options" link when logging in if your phone is lost or corrupted.
2. You can probably disable Authenticator and mobile phone 2FA and rely on email as the 2FA check (my test account is currently configured that way).
3. You can recover your wallet using a variety of software using the 12 word backup you made when you created the wallet. (You do have a backup, yes?)
4. You may not really ever need a web-access wallet. You can use a wallet on your phone and/or desktop for seemingly every use case. Your backup will allow you to restore your wallet in case you lose/corrupt your device.

It's tricky to speculate. Cryptocurrencies would be largely insulated from any fiat-related disaster and would gain in value relative to the extent that people's perceived value in other assets evaporate. *However*, if those who's assets are evaporating include crypto holders, then they could easily need to sell off their crypto to purchase fiat for basic needs or portfolio rebalancing. In the short term, there's no way to know what would happen.

You are correct. I'll just add that the xpub reveals all addresses within only that particular BIP 44 account, so it's possible with many wallet apps to create one or more new accounts under the same master seed and move your balance there to regain full privacy.

Which wallet are you using? It would be highly unlikely for you to generate an invalid or unspendable address from any of the most recommended wallets. In fact, you could download Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium or simply visit Blockonomics.co and check the address for technical validity.
However, testing and playing with your wallet using small amounts is highly recommended for operational knowledge and best practices. As long as you are using a reputable wallet with a secured backup, you should be ready to receive. A local Bitcoin ATM (coinatmradar.com) is an easy and quick way to play with your first small amount. Download a different (reputable) wallet and send funds between them.

Having multiple outputs (potentially new addresses) per transaction would explain it.
@_date: 2017-02-20 00:38:21
Fees are actually determined by the size of the transaction in bytes, not the value of the transaction. They go to pay the miners for including a transaction into a block. The higher the fee the sooner it will likely be confirmed into a block. If you're using a regular wallet like Airbitz or Breadwallet, it will choose a fee for you (or allow you to choose amongst three suggested levels).
With LocalBitcoins you will most likely be dealing with a non-escrowed, straight transaction. In this case, the fee is paid by the seller when he constructs the transaction that pays you bitcoin. It may be his policy or your request for him to use a higher than average fee level depending upon his wallet's options. It could also be his intent to defraud you with a double-spend transaction back to himself. Either way, you'll want to agree on a fee level beforehand, if possible, and stay until you have at least one confirmation before leaving the meetup.
Happy to help. :)

Keep in mind with Copay you could create your own 2-of-2 or 2-of-3 multisig wallet with keys generated on one or two other devices (the third could be temporary). Backup all master seeds. Now you have your own 2FA vault where two of the two/three devices or their backups will be needed to spend from your wallet.
Not as good as hardware or offline key generation, but a good deal better than regular hot wallets. You could use this in combination with the Trezor for "medium-security" funds.

First: You can't lose funds in a transaction attempt unless you send/receive to a wrong address or build a transaction manually.
Second, there is a large backlog in unconfirmed transactions right now, which is becoming a more frequent occurrence for the network. The fee needed to make it into a block within a given time period changes all the time. This is why good wallets use dynamic fee code.
Third, we can't tell if your 0.003 fee was sufficient or not without knowing the size (in bytes) of your transaction. Posting the TX ID or a link to the transaction would be helpful.
Fourth, you may be able to help the transaction with the VIABTC accelerator:

Although it's theoretically possible to convert Electrum's master seed into BIP 39, I don't know of an existing tool that could do that. It would save you much more time just to empty the Electrum wallet with a standard transaction.

This only has the potential to impact wallets generated with Copay or Bitpay. If you have one of those, you should try to restore your wallet in Mycelium. If you funds show up you are fine.

Interesting. Thanks for exploring Bitcoin acceptance!
Here's a useful thread for discussion:
Between this and your link, it looks like you have a choice of (at least) Bitpay, Coinbase, Stripe, Coinify, CoinGate, CoinPayments.net, and Blockchain.info. These latter two would be great to try if you had no need for automatic conversion into USD. CoinPayments would allow you to accept both BTC and ETH.
This thread indicates that some people are having issues with Bitpay and Stripe, both coding-wise and with compliance. Be sure to test your chosen implementation thoroughly.
Both Bitpay and Coinbase should provide free conversion into local currency, but I can't guarantee that.

1. You can only spend coins you control (the change that was returned to you). Attempting to double-spend your original transaction might work as well, but probably has a lower rate of success (and is not CPFP). Since it's your change, I'm assuming you don't want to send the receiver more than what you intended in the first transaction.
2. No, by definition CPFP requires you to construct a transaction signing outputs from the first transaction. Only the receiver or yourself (if there's change) can do this.
3. The second (CPFP) transaction only has to be the minimum your wallet (Electrum) will allow, however you should probably send the entire change amount minus your new fee because sending less would create a new change output that would increase the byte size of your transaction.

Bitstamp is a popular exchange, but I don't believe they allow third-party deposits into your account. Therefore, it would not be a solution to your problem.
Some merchants have provided careful and patient guidance to their customers who want to pay with bitcoin by walking them through the steps to signing up, funding, and purchasing from a company like Coinbase. A really quick (but not likely cheap) way for your clients to buy bitcoin would be for them to use a [Bitcoin ATM]( near to them. You'd have to judge if that is a feasible course to recommend.

Most of the time Airbitz recognizes new unconfirmed transactions almost instantly.

I would find the Armory forums and make sure you're downloading the newest version. The old website is still up, I think, from the last company that owned it.
Armory also requires a completely synced full node to operate properly (Core, Classic, or BU). You may have to wait days for that node to catch up to the network, then potentially many hours for Armory to create it's own database.
A best practice is to unchecked the option where Armory launches your node software for you. Then, just make sure your full node is running and caught up first before launching Armory.

This is pretty unfortunate, actually, that it keeps getting rebroadcast. You might want to wait until the weekend to use the ViaBTC accelerator when there isn't as much demand. Otherwise, you could potentially try to double-spend the transaction with a higher fee (requiring the same inputs, not necessarily the same outputs). I know Multibit [allows]( you to reset it's transaction cache, but I don't know if it will allow you to sign and broadcast transactions while it is still restoring it's mempool.
I could potentially guide you to another option as well for a last-ditch effort.

There's no way to create a "stable" (relative to what?) currency from nothing unless it is pegged to a reference currency (i.e., promissory notes, not independent monies). Any new currency that does eventually become a major form of money must see itself increase greatly in value over its formative years and must do so via a series of bubbles and crashes.
In other words, Bitcoin may end up becoming exactly what you are looking for (and the most stable money ever utilized by man), but it will take potentially decades to get there assuming adoption continues to increase.
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:20:07
Oh, so you're checking the transaction with an external block explorer and it doesn't show up at all? That would mean that Electrum hasn't successfully broadcast it yet. In my experience, Electrum doesn't update itself or maintain its connection to the outside Electrum server very well.
You should try to completely close the program and restart it. If there is a rescan option (I can't remember at the moment), you could try that too.

You could download [Ian Coleman's BIP 39 tool]( (see the offline instructions at the bottom) and open it in a browser on an offline computer or USB session. Then, input your backup words, make sure the BIP 44 tab is selected (it is by default), and compare the address list to those in your Wallet Information in Copay or Bitpay. If they are the same addresses, you are not affected.

BitPay Wallet is a rebranded and forked version of BitPay's Copay open-source wallet, so they are essentially the same thing but with interface changes and BitPay card support. I, personally, don't care for the rebranding, and it creates the concern that Copay will be getting less attention (which it could use). They've added helpful instruction screens for newbies in BitPay Wallet, but they've made the advanced wallet settings harder to access. Also, creating a testnet multisig wallet using BitPay along with other Copay wallets quietly failed on the BitPay side in one experiment, making me a little suspect. Livenet was fine, though, in my sole test.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:49:38
Lots of people are having this issue right now, unfortunately, and have been for weeks. Normally a Bitcoin transaction sent with even a very low fee will still confirm within three days. I'm sorry that it's taking so long. If you want to post or directly message me with your transaction ID I can help you look up an estimate of when your transaction will confirm.
@_date: 2017-02-19 20:47:20
Electrum can spend unconfirmed. I can't think of any other wallet offhand. If you're the sender, find the "change" address where the remaining amount of your input was sent back to you (if any). If you are the receiver, find the address/output where you are receiving coins. Enable the Coins tab via the Wallet menu. Then right click that address or input and select to spend from it (be sure it is associated with the first unconfirmed transaction). You may now construct a transaction back to yourself (copy another address from your wallet) using any fee you like.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:44:44
Messaged you. Your options are either wait, use one of the two transaction accelerators, attempt CPFP, or attempt a double-spend. Neither of the last two options look to be possible from within Multibit so your wallet would have to be imported into other tools.

You should have received automated messages during the 48 hour window to confirm that you wanted to continue with the vault withdrawal. Does the transaction still show pending from your vault? Do you show a pending transaction from your regular wallet? Do you have a regular or multisig vault?

It depends. There is no simple answer to what fee you should use except to follow what your wallet recommends as the standard or high fee level. We'd need to know which wallet you're using to guide you further. 6 cents does seem too small for any basic transaction right now, however.
Your transaction is merely unconfirmed. It will either eventually confirm or drop off the network. Either way you won't have lost money.

Yes, there is an entire class of payment service providers (PSPs) which provide Bitcoin integration services while requiring little or no information from the customer. These I call "non-custodial" PSPs because they typically pass through your bitcoin to your own private wallet. Mycelium Gear, CoinSimple, certain block explorers, and certain shopping cart plugins are examples. [Blockonomics.co]( is the one I work with providing options for both individual hosted invoicing and full client website API integration. Blockonomics is designed never to touch your bitcoin revenue, even just briefly to forward it on.
You can use a non-custodial PSP to accept Bitcoin directly and then sell, as needed, later for local currency through the usual channels. This permits you to separate the two functions and maintain your Bitcoin acceptance online even as you switch amongst exchange options.
Finding a custodial PSP that will exchange for you without identification/verification would be really difficult.

No. There is nothing you can do to affect the old phone (unless you enabled some service that lets you reset the old phone remotely).
By moving all your bitcoin off of that Mycelium wallet you will accomplish largely the same goal, however.
Understand that with private Bitcoin wallets there are no global (cloud-based) "accounts", only individual wallets like physical wallets. However, unlike physical wallets that get lost or stolen, with Bitcoin you can still move your money to a new wallet using a backup.

It might be best for you to search the forums for people asking for ways to buy bitcoin and compile together all the responses. In the cases I've seen of merchants advising customers on how to acquire BTC, they usually refer them to Coinbase or LocalBitcoins. BitQuick.co and a [local ATM]( are also good options. There are websites that list various options with guidance as well. The more support you offer your customers in this regard the higher the conversion rate. I'd be sure to offer a discount for BTC purchases (unless your products are exclusive or hard to find). Discounts of up to 20% have been known to really motivate conversion when paired with thorough customer service.

Someone should have pointed this out earlier:
It looks like the OP's phone has been **rooted**, because Titanium Backup (Pro) requires root access to operate. This explains why this has yet become a serious threat for common Android wallets.
For users who choose to root their phones like the OP, however, then it looks like Airbitz is the only private Android wallet that retains significant security. Breadwallet reportedly refuses to install on rooted phones. Bitpay/Copay, Mycelium, Jaxx? Forget it. GreenAddress with well-thought out 2FA could be another potential option, though.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:30:53
Yours is a definite outlier, I'm afraid. It has literally been sitting unconfirmed for **six days!** It's last rebroadcast was supposedly [March 2nd]( It also had confirmed inputs before this transaction was broadcast from what I can tell.
I have successfully submitted this to ViaBTC's transaction accelerator for you, so hopefully it will confirm today.
Even at 32 sat/B I would have expected the transaction to confirm by now. I had two 10 sat/B and one 5 sat/B transactions submitted during the height of the mempool backlog from two weeks ago confirm on the following Sunday.

If you're looking to trade you'll have to look into other exchange apps, but if you looking to hold and use Bitcoin on the network you should try a wallet like Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium, or Breadwallet on mobile. You can combine that with a separate crypto-asset tracking app for charts and market updates.

NH is currently one of only two US states (IIRC) that require special licenses for bitcoin money transmitters (New York is the other with their famous "BitLicense"). This bill would nullify that and make it possible for exchanges and BTM operators who have left or could not enter the state to return. It may also go even farther to protect crypto-related businesses from ordinary money transmitter requirements.

Ledger has an offline seed generation tool for the nano (and HW1) that you create as a live USB, but it doesn't require a Ledger device to use.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:21:04
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:49:59
Purse.io is an option.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:58:08
Ledger's Nano and HW1 don't have a hardware display, so it requires seed display (and, apparently, generation) on the computer used to set it up. They warn you to use a trusted computer when creating a wallet using the Chrome app, however they also provide this custom linux live USB for generation and setup in a more secure and presumably network-incapable OS environment.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:51:21
Your options are then quite limited, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:21:04
Edit: I misunderstood you. Your Mycelium wallet was on your Android phone that restarted while you were sending bitcoin using Electrum on another device? In that case, there is little cause for concern. If you used a correct address from your Mycelium wallet then your phone could be completely off(line) and it would still go through. If you're trying to send the funds again from Mycelium you'll have to wait until the first transaction confirms on the network.

@_date: 2017-03-06 21:21:04
It's confirmed.
Sadly, Bitcoin congestion has shot up tremendously over the past few months. People who were used to quick transactions are now experiencing delays over several hours or days. In the future, use a high fee level if your wallet allows selection or even manual fee selection via the suggested level at BitcoinFees.21.co
If you have already have a pending transaction, look it up on [Blockonomics.co]( to see an estimate of it's confirmation time (calculated as 1/2 of BitcoinFees' max time estimate for that fee level).
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:59:06
As for wallets, the one I often recommend as the best compromise between user friendliness and security is [Airbitz]( for Android and iOS. However, if your customers are buying through Coinbase it is probably easier to just have them pay from there, *especially* if you also have a Coinbase account (pay-to-email and instant off-chain payments).
Airbitz integrates with Glidera for buys/sells within the US, however their onboarding process is onerous for users.
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:53:12
At minimum you would need a hardware wallet capable of alphanumeric entry via the device itself. Ledger Blue is the only one I can think of right now. Please contact the hardware wallet vendors and indicate your demand! That will likely become a standard feature in time.

Hi Blockonomics is a non-custodial payment service provider that's perfect for individual, immediate invoice needs like you describe as well as businesses who want to integrate our API or our web cart plugins for PrestaShop or WooCommerce.
You can generate an invoice without an account by simply pasting your own public receive address into the search bar and clicking "Create P2P Invoice". Then enter your requested amount in one of several currencies, type an optional description, double-check your receive address, and click to create. You will be given a URL which you can share with the customer. Your invoice will stay up-to-date with current bitcoin prices so that you receive your desired local currency equivalent amount no matter when the customer pays.
Keep in mind that we operate purely with Bitcoin and that our invoices are encrypted, so only you and whomever you share the URL with can see its contents (not even us). You will need a standard Bitcoin wallet to receive with (I recommend Airbitz or Mycelium, but any would work, including custodial services). Because we never touch your bitcoin there is no custodial risk when using our services. Therefore if you desire exchange into local currency you must use other services specific to your region.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:26:26
Unless momentum shifts from Bitcoin to an alternative cryptocurrency or a scaling solution is put in place, then these delays will continue or worsen for the foreseeable future.
You can lookup your transaction at [Blockonomics.co]( to see a rough estimate of how long it will take to confirm.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:46:49
Potentially BitQuick.co. Not "instant" but same day.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:07:00
Due to scaling limitations (the solution of which is the subject of tremendous debate), Bitcoin blocks are now essentially full. Transaction fees are being bid up to prioritize capacity. This has dramatically worsened over the past 3-4 months, so a lot of people are encountering delays that they never had to deal with before. Unfortunately, the only way to get a relatively quick transaction is to pay a high fee (choose the priority fee level in many fee-estimating wallets).
Sorry for the trouble.
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:46:25
Thanks for accepting! Just keep advertising it as a payment method in any other shop ads you do and customer correspondence.

Are you accounting for network fees? Every transaction you send will require a fee of as much as a few dollars (though typically less than a dollar) and Mycelium will subtract that from your total balance.

I appreciate that, but I wanted the scope of this series to include multisig and call out the fact that at least one key is held by another entity. I define my use of the term and explain the difference between basic custodial and multsig wallets in the opening paragraphs.

Cold storage is defined as a private key that's never been on a system connected to a network. The most common of these is the paper wallet you can generate with BitAddress.org (after downloading and on an offline computer). Hardware wallets like the Trezor, KeepKey, and Ledger are another option. A permanently offline old computer would be a third.
Mobile wallets are great to begin with and for everyday spending needs, though I wouldn't store more than a few bitcoin. Paper backups need to be created for every digital wallet you create. Airbitz, Copay, and Mycelium are great options here.
I'd recommend browsing or doing a search for more opinions on cold storage and wallets, as well as reading everything at Bitcoin.org and the links along the sidebar here.
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:15:08
True, unless they flag pre-credit or unconfirmed trades in some way, but most likely they'll absorb the potential trade loss and settle for seizing the user's balances.
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:13:24
Although I would also recommend accepting directly (this can be done through the website via APIs or checkout buttons or via invoicing the customer directly), and recommend Blockonomics.co for this route, it would be wise to mention custodial payment service providers who process your bitcoin and allow you to immediately exchange into local currency. These companies include Bitpay, Coinbase, GoCoin, CoinGate and others, but require business verification and approval.
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:55:42
The only way I could see that this narrative makes sense as presented is if they're talking about initiating a real estate purchase at the $750 level but only presenting the buyer with the actual Bitcoin payment request at the $1000 level days later.
Not really a story.
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:54:50
Technically, the bitcoin is already accessible by your associated private key, which is contained within your Core wallet. It's just that your wallet doesn't know it has received payment yet until it downloads the entire blockchain. If you can wait for that process to occur (could take weeks), then, yes, you can spend from there. If you can't, then you can type a command to dump the list of private keys and import the correct one into a mobile wallet like Mycelium, which can recognize the payment faster.

Yes, CoinPayments should be fine. Yes, I'd probably convert alts to bitcoin and then keep the bitcoin myself on Electrum, Copay, Airbitz, Mycelium, etc. Best conversion method into local currency depends on the fee profile for your area.

Well, then I applaud you for being a pioneer in your area! If you need any help on the technical means of assistance or conversion then please ask here on Reddit. I would recommend offering discounts for Bitcoin purchases: Both a larger, short-term discount to accompany the announcement news, and a smaller discount that you can continuously offer. Get people to ask about it. Put up a little explanation page of what Bitcoin is and how people can buy it. These things will help spur adoption.

If you want to trade in the short term then you have to keep it on an exchange (or do the 1/3 on exchange with 3X leverage like was suggested earlier). If you sell for a Coinbase USD balance then that should be better insured (but verify for yourself).
We're just talking about those who want to hold bitcoin longer term (3+ months) should hold them in their own wallet.

I'd say Bitcoin has little present day utility for most people in western nations who do not admire the currency for its monetary properties. There is dramatically less utility the farther back in time you go to Bitcoin's inception. If you keep these things in mind....
Why would someone want to hold and use Bitcoin right now (or in the past)? The overwhelming "value" draw is the potential to make short or long term profit on exchange rate increases. Even those of us who want to use it as a superior money in our daily lives are incentivized by the speculative angle, so, yes, that gets more discussion. This becomes especially so anytime there are significant short-term price swings. Such attention isn't necessarily bad, however, as it often brings in a new wave of holders who add to the potential base of spenders.
Now, I, personally, use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange every chance I get to promote adoption, and I actually do spend regularly via Purse and CardCash where fiat-calculated savings are worth the effort.

Is your goal just to day trade or store long term? If it's the latter, then you should move it off to a wallet you control like Airbitz (android and iOS), Mycelium (android), Breadwallet (iOS), Copay (mobile and desktop), and others. See

Bitpay is great if you want to convert to local currency, but perhaps overkill if you just want to accept Bitcoin directly. Bitpay requires lots of info and approval for new accounts. Maybe Blockonomics.co would be better suited to you. It's free to start and builds on top of one of many existing private wallets you may already be using.

Although great for the Gemini user experience, this doesn't seem to represent any new tech or analysis technique. Rather they are doing literally the same thing they've been doing with ACH: Giving you a credit on their system you can play with but can't actually take possession of until the source transaction clears normally. If it doesn't, they can wipe out your credit and all the trades you've done with it.

Private keys are stored with every electronic wallet; otherwise it wouldn't be able to sign transactions. There is always a risk that external software / malware can find a way to access and decrypt those keys, but the risk is generally less on mobile than desktop.

Indeed, your solution would be more private and verifiable. Do you define "3rd-party" as any reliance upon an external server, however? Because there are non-custodial Bitcoin payment service providers that either automatically pass along the client's revenue or never touch those bitcoin to begin with.
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:21:51
Yes. Proper backup security is essential. One method may be to encrypt the backup words that still yields a result you can store on paper (or multiple digital backups), but you'll then have to remember how to decrypt it.
Hardware wallets are designed to protect the private keys from digital attack vectors, not to provide greater physical security.

Visit Bitcoin.org and WeUseCoins.org for some basic info. Private keys are what enable you (and ONLY you) to sign a transaction which spends bitcoin to another address. You must keep your private keys *private*. Wallets are apps that generate and store private keys (and their associated public addresses), create transactions, watch for incoming transactions, and allow you to track your overall balance. Wallets like those I recommended generate private keys on your own phone or tablet and don't reveal them to others. Online wallets like Coinbase generate and hold all the private keys themselves, meaning they (or a hacker) could steal your funds or restrict your ability to access your funds.
Coinbase can be used to buy bitcoin easily, but I always recommend you send it to a mobile wallet after receiving. For long-term storage of savings in bitcoin I recommend a hardware or paper wallet.

Just FYI: Mobile wallets like Mycelium are great for bitcoin amounts up to, say, 3-10 bitcoins (opinions differ), but I wouldn't store your entire bitcoin holdings in just one wallet. Long-term savings should not be in an hot wallet but secured in a hardware or paper wallet.

Not necessarily. Bitcoin-accepting merchants who hold BTC *might* be better off refunding the original bitcoin amount. It also may be a business decision to offer greater convenience to the Bitcoin customer for refunds.
**Edit**: I wasn't careful to separate refund form from method used to calculate the refund. Merchants accepting and holding BTC, especially (but not limited to) those pricing goods/services in BTC, could easily offer refunds of the original BTC amount. In the more likely case, merchants who convert immediately to fiat will want to refund the original fiat amount, but this could also be in the form of bitcoin, just calculated at the rate in effect when the refund is issued. Store credit or no refunds are also valid choices.
In any case, this is a decision to be made by the business owner unique to their circumstances. It is not at all clear that they should base their policies off of Newegg or any existing retailer. As bitcoin volatility continues to decline in the years ahead, it will be become less and less certain which currency basis will protect the merchant from speculation.

Nice! Ask her to accept Bitcoin for payment. It's pretty easy. I'd be happy to help with any questions and recommended methods. Just a wallet like Airbitz if she wants to receive directly, or Coinbase or Bitpay if she wants to sell immediately.
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:48:51
A [local Bitcoin ATM]( might be easier if one is nearby, but you'll need cash and to pay a higher fee. LocalBitcoins may also be an option.
@_date: 2017-01-27 05:58:05
It would help to give us the transaction link, or TXID, or destination address. Also what wallet software are you using to receive?
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:53:04
I could receive 1 BTC into an address and send it off again for less fees than if I had slowly accumulated that 1 BTC over time and did the same send. Fees are only loosely correlated to value in the sense that larger values can require more inputs to form. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:23:42
For the purposes of this warning, yes, because you don't control your own private keys on Coinbase (you hold an IOU like a bank). Better to send them to your own personal mobile or desktop wallet like Airbitz, Copay, etc. 
BUT, be prepared to make and secure your own paper backup of the wallet you install. Otherwise it is *worse* than storing on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:30:55
The "Bitpay" wallet is really a rebranded and slightly enhanced version of their open source Copay wallet, which I do indeed recommend. However their interface and features are not as advanced as others in some respects. For one, you can't control the fee level from within the transaction screen.
For newbies on mobile I usually recommend Airbitz due to their familiar login system and automatic backups plus other neat features, including a built-in merchant directory. Mycelium, on the other hand, is even more capable but not as pretty and is better for users who already have some experience. Breadwallet is newbie-friendly, but too basic.
On desktop, however, you are right: Copay is easily the best newbie wallet.

Well, you are right (even on Android), but, wow, is it hidden! It would make more sense just to tap the top of the local currency screen to rotate through denominations but instead we must hold and swipe all the way across the Back icon, which is definitely counterintuitive. Thanks for pointing this out, though.

First off: Thanks for wanting to add Bitcoin as a method of payment!
The exact integration will depend upon where you want to accept Bitcoin (i.e., in a shopping cart, as a "Buy with Bitcoin" button, as an invoice, or in-person). Bitpay is the market leader for payment processing services and can do all of these things. However, if you're looking to hold all of your bitcoin revenue and not convert it to local currency (in the short term) or you are denied access to Bitpay for any reason, you will find more convenient options elsewhere.

Vitalik is referring to the potential use case (back then) of a large organization generating one HD wallet for auditing simplicity but handing out deterministic keypairs from that wallet to individual departments. In other words, spreading the private keys around to multiple people. He correctly points out the inevitability of someone combining a private key with the public master to reveal all private keys for the organization.
Your use case of submitting *only* public single addresses and master public keys to block explorers will not compromise the security of your wallet as long as you keep your private keys *private*. Revealing an xpub will allow anyone who acquires it to see your entire transaction history and balance for that particular account--potentially damaging for your privacy, however that is precisely the property that makes receive-only wallets and services so useful.
We allow people to use either single addresses, multiple single addresses, or xpubs on Blockonomics.co for wallet tracking and address generation, especially in our Wallet Watcher (which can be used pseudo-anonymously and with additional entropy). It also enables us to provide permissionless, private payment services to websites and apps. See this [visual walkthrough]( of our web services.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:38:40

Airbitz, Mycelium, Copay, Breadwallet, and others where you generate your own private keys. Fastest way to buy $25 might be a [local ATM]( (if nearby). Fastest online method might be instant buy qualification on Coinbase.com.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:05:25
Thanks for the comparison. Another for you to look into is Coinapult's Autosell addresses and Locks addresses (via the Mycelium wallet). Fee is supposedly 1.5% (0.75% each way). Using Mycelium it is possible to do this pseudo-anonymously and using most any wallet software. However, I would guess that GDAX has insured USD accounts, so that does seem like the better option.
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:13:09
Very nice layout and excellent content, but did you intentionally leave out Airbitz?
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:27:27
Such a service hasn't really been pursued because your trading a reversible payment form (CCs for up to 6 months) for a non-reversible payment form (bitcoin). An entity who did this would have to charge high fees to counter the risk.
*Technically*, this method does exist via the Paxful.com marketplace and the Pay with Paxful button code they offer on their site. A customer of yours will be redirected to the Paxful marketplace where they may choose an individual seller (who may accept CCs) to purchase the exact bitcoin amount you are requesting from your site. The fees will be enormous, however, and scam risk non-trivial.
Your best bet might be to find a regular online Bitcoin exchange or local exchange (LocalBitcoins) that services your area and guide your customers step-by-step into acquiring enough bitcoin to fulfill an order with you.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:47:23
It can be as simple as:
 
* Download Airbitz onto a mobile device
* Create a user/pass and pin for the new wallet
* WRITE DOWN that user/pass and store the paper safely
* Copy the new address from the Request tab
* Use Coinbase or your current exchange to send a small test amount to this new address
* If it works, then feel free to send the rest to the same or new address showing in Airbitz
* Setup the password recovery and 2FA options if desired.
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:12:39
Airbitz is also excellent.
@_date: 2017-01-20 18:28:06
Fantastic! Please make sure you have a large numpad entry screen for price entry (as in, don't depend upon the device's built-in keyboard) and design it with a fixed decimal point so that numbers entered fill in the price/total field from right to left. If not default, make this entry method an option in settings, please.
@_date: 2017-01-29 02:53:11
Not necessarily low fees, but a [local BTM]( or LocalBitcoins is probably your best bet. Sell your PayPal for cash first.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:35:02
Mycelium is one of the best wallets out there, but only for Android (the iOS version is a different codebase). Airbitz and Copay are also very strong options.
@_date: 2017-01-31 07:05:56
Mycelium and Copay should also work (but possibly only for basic transactions).

@_date: 2017-01-20 20:02:12
I can't explain it mathematically, but if that were a problem it would have been discovered years ago. The extended public key (xpub) of HD wallets can be used to generate all addresses present and future that will ever use that xpub, however, this doesn't compromise the security of that wallet.
*However*, if you were to ever leak a single private key along with an xpub then those could be used to derive the extended private key and completely compromise your wallet. That's why private key control is so critical.
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:44:16
Thank you for accepting and doing it *right*!
If you have a physical location, be sure to add it to CoinMap, Airbitz, and Yelp. If you sell items online, look into Spendabit listing. Try to be a part of Bitcoin Black Friday this year as well.

The Blockchain Merchant app now works with any xpub, not just BC.i accounts. That's useful in the short-term.

Good question, but I doubt any Bitcoin spender using it for retail purchases is going to change their habits based on recent fees. More likely they're worried it won't confirm at all, which may put a damper on the number of attempts.

There are little BitTeller machines you can buy for the lowest cost. Otherwise, I'd check out the resources on CoinATMRadar, including their used machine ads. Maybe even contact the owner of that site for some guidance.
That's assuming you want to own and run your own, which may have regulatory implications. If you'd rather host a machine run by a local operator, check CoinATMRadar for those operating in your state and seek out those companies directly. Their websites often have a link or guidance for those who wish to host. You'll be paid for the space the machine takes up or share in the actual revenue.

Much like BitAddress.org, this page's code generates private keys in your browser, so they don't have access (in theory). They use the username and password as part of the input for generating keys, meaning there should be no database of accounts sitting somewhere. I would probably trust it with tiny amounts if I had an immediate need or for testing purposes, but with widespread, well-developed mobile wallets, there is little reason to make this a primary solution.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:29:25
Purse has been useful for me, though you don't want to set your percentage off request too high. Maybe just use Purse Instant and shop there directly, first, to get used to it.
For other shopping online, and besides Overstock and NewEgg, try Spendabit.co to search for BTC-accepting shops that have items you are interested in. Also try to search for "bitcoin" on Etsy and then filter by category to find individual shops that accept bitcoin (verify with them, first). For local merchants, try CoinMap.org, Airbitz.co (or download their great wallet app), and search for the "accepts bitcoin" attribute on Yelp in your area.

I recommend either a Bitpay or Coinbase to create payment buttons with (custodial payment processors that will require business identification and verification), or ask people to contact you to request credits with Bitcoin (invoice them via Blockonomics.co), or integrate the Blockonomics API into your own solution, or use CoinSimple to create simple payment links where your customers must enter their name and email first before being presented with a payment request. I hear Mycelium Gear can do this also.

You could load Electrum or Armory on an offline PC and load in your private key to obtain the public. Even easier might be to download an offline copy of BitAddress.org to do the same. Beware that you may have malware which could capture your private key string and send it off when you're back online (not likely, but possible). You could use Mycelium on a mobile device and never again connect it to a network, or just import/sweep the private key into a mobile wallet and send the entire value back out to a freshly made paper wallet.

Many sites and businesses are excluded from exchange-based payment service providers because they belong to certain industries or are otherwise deemed "high-risk". You can look in their terms for a list of prohibited activities.
This is why we have non-custodial PSPs ([like this one]( who do not handle their clients' bitcoin revenue and do not interface with fiat.

This is incorrect. Coinbase defaults to a custodial, bank-like relationship but allows for a shared, multisig version of its Vault product. Meanwhile, BitGo always defaults to a shared, 2-of-3 multisig implementation where both they and the Key Recovery Sevice would have to collude to steal the customer's funds. Alternatively, you can choose to create that third key yourself, even using entirely unrelated software. The user key is generated and encrypted in the browser.
I'm not saying private wallets aren't still better, but just that there is more than just bank and private. BitGo is an example of what's in-between.

I suppose a case could be made for either, but if the price is undergoing a rapid change within a day (as we've seen recently), then I'd say it'd be best to use last price.
As for their "local" versus "global" rate.... In my experience, their GBX returns the highest price of any exchange average I see, whereas Bitpay's BBB is usually the lowest. BitcoinAverage's "local" exchange rate for BTC/USD is a fair compromise between the two.
Right now, though, Coinbase is showing the highest price out of these four.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:10:31
Not correct. Blockchain.info does not control your private keys, but it does store them (encrypted) and controls the software used to decrypt it. There are larger attack surfaces with them than with a mobile wallet like Airbitz, Mycelium, Copay, etc.

In my experience the typical Bitcoin ATM user is *not* a typical Bitcoin enthusiast. They are often very separate demographics. I would speculate they use Bitcoin because they have to more than because they want to and alternatives are even more costly.

Right, but do you have a current Circle USD balance or a bitcoin balance in your Circle wallet? If you have a bitcoin balance you should be able to send it to an external address. If you have a USD balance you can no longer purchase bitcoin.

You want to backup the master seed (or user/pass with Airbitz) to paper and store that securely against damage and theft. It is irresponsible, in fact, to setup a digital wallet without a backup.
The backup will let you restore the same wallet keys on a new device or even a different wallet app.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:14:29
Yes, although their Vault is a better product than the basic wallet. Still, I'd prefer to control my own keys ([Choose Your Wallet]( I'd recommend Airbitz for the beginner.

Maybe a [local Bitcoin ATM]( would be better? Otherwise, there is likely someone at LocalBitcoins or Paxful that can help.
@_date: 2016-11-18 03:53:02
I would say yes. The *most important* thing is to **backup** your master seed (or user/pass in the case of Airbitz). Do NOT skip this step. If anything happens to your phone (or computer in the case of a PC wallet) the backup is what you'll need to recover your funds. Otherwise your bitcoin will be lost forever.
After that, it might be best to spread your funds across multiple wallets in case one develops a critical flaw/is hacked. For storing even larger amounts, look to hardware wallets and paper wallets and develop a fully thought out backup &amp; survivorship strategy.

Coinbase takes *their* bitcoin and sends it to your address using a standard bitcoin transaction. This is when the bitcoin actually become *yours*. You may think I'm being pedantic, but the ownership of IOUs instead of the underlying asset is true for every fiat bank in operation today, as well as many precious metals accounts. People have been very disappointed to learn they are only a *creditor* to an institution that's gone bankrupt. Mt.Gox users and others learned this the hard way.

If you're paying me to store your $100 in my safe, that's most likely a custodial relationship. The $100 always remains yours. By contrast, if I'm paying you interest (or allowing you to "store" for "free"), most likely you have transferred ownership to me in exchange for a promise to pay you back (subject to lengthy rules).
This fine distinction between custodial accounts (which aren't always easy to find, even for precious metals storage) and claim accounts where you are a (likely unsecured) creditor on someone else's balance sheet is lost on many gold investors, never mind the general public. Think of the term used in banking when they increase your balance: You will receive a "credit" for x USD. This is referencing an increase to the Accounts Payables side of their balance sheet.
TL;DR: You never own the dollars, gold, or any other asset you place in a deposit account. You only own a promissory note for those assets.

Yes, just show the public address from the MyTrezor software, which should display a QR code, and scan that with Breadwallet. Verify the first and last digits of the address string and send a small test amount to verify that it works. Then, you can send the rest to the same or new address that MyTrezor gives you.
If by "directly" you mean import the private key, I'm not sure how to get private keys out of Breadwallet without using other software.

No, but if you intend to keep that bitcoin for a longer duration and not trade in the short term, I would certainly advise you to move it to a wallet app where you control your private keys (Airbitz, Mycelium, Copay, Breadwallet, etc.). Holding it in Coinbase is no different that holding an IOU.

Agree with the paper wallet idea, or a physical wallet like a coin or engraved metal card. Even dogtags can be made with QR codes (public address for each nephew). I've seen Etsy shops that allow QR codes to be printed on other gift items.
I actually did this for some friends of mine two years ago. Generated a regular wallet, made paper copies of the master seed, then handed them the paper plus receive-only cards from Bit-Card.de (they no longer appear to be in operation).
Multisig might apply if you wanted to create a scenario where both nephews have to agree to spend the coins, or if you wanted a parent to sign off on each transaction. Copay would probably be the best tool here. One installation for each parent (desktop or mobile) with backups, then one installation for each child (on your device, with a backup). Then when they're old enough they should be able to import that backup into their own wallet and become a cosigner to the account. I haven't tested this though. Be sure to test any solution before committing 5 BTC!

Depends on the exchange you are using. Many times you are paying a flat percentage (say 1%) to exchange into and out of bitcoin, with potentially additional fees depending on the fiat payment method you select.

Great news for Bitpay customers!
@_date: 2016-11-05 18:40:19
Not true, sir. By using a typical merchant exchange payment processor, such as Bitpay, Coinbase, and GoCoin, you can convert your bitcoin revenue immediately to a local currency credit on your account that can be settled within days. By contrast, Paypal or CCs are never truly settled until months and months later (due to chargeback risk). Bitpay and Coinbase also offer FREE conversion for lower volume merchants right now, compared to the 2-3%+other fees charged by fiat processors.
In other words, as a Bitcoin accepting vendor, you can choose to hold or not hold bitcoin as you prefer. There are plenty of options for both.

That's precisely the philosophy Blockonomics is looking to support. Whereas most businesses who wish to accept BTC are directed towards a fiduciary like Bitpay, and individuals in need for occasional payment requests resort to Coinbase or manual invoicing, Blockonomics gives both spheres a choice to use P2P invoicing with just an address (no account) or an API for payment generation without permission (unlike BC.i), utilizing addresses from an existing wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:48:08
Blockchain.info? No, not technically. Though I would personally not use BC.i over mobile or desktop wallets like Airbitz, Mycelium, Copay, etc.

They could also invoice through Blockonomics.co without any setup needed, or use our API for a custom integration.

Thanks for being a Bitcoin pioneer! May I ask if you advertise your acceptance in any way? We can get you added to a few listings if it's a physical location. Offering a discount for customers is another way to attract attention and encourage education.

You may need to wait, but you could also, technically, lookup the commands to export your private key list from Core, find the one private key that matches your public address where the funds were sent, and then import that private key into Electrum, Mycelium, or another compatible wallet that does not download the blockchain.

Just store it safely and out of the sight of others as a backup to your Mycelium wallet. If you ever lose access to your Mycelium device, you can use that backup to restore your wallet on a new device using Mycelium, Copay, and others.

99.99999% of businesses don't accept any new currency. I'd say we're making progress. ...unless, of course, you believe it's impossible to bootstrap any new currency (how did the ones we have come about?).


Business that do this increase the utility of bitcoin as a medium of exchange, thereby increasing the likelihood of adoption by individuals and other businesses, which eventually leads to better reasons to _keep_ bitcoin and use it directly --&gt; closed loop.


Never is a problem, at least according to Austrian monetary theory. Prices in an economy will adjust downward and bitcoin is highly divisible. Smaller than Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) units are possible with a future upgrade. Also, by not increasing the supply (inflating), you avoid discoordination effects and discourage rent seeking (again, according to Austrian theory).


Bitcoin is regulated.... _by math._

Both Bitpay and Coinbase charge zero fees for conversion on low volumes. There may be some slight exchange rate spread, but I don't see how that could be labeled "expensive".

@_date: 2016-11-23 16:17:21
I assume this is your transaction?
If so, it looks like you either overpaid by a factor of 10 (0.03056 BTC vs .003 BTC) or this is a screenshot of the amount remaining to pay, which appears to be below the threshold that Virwox is willing to handle (without an additional fee).
Assuming your window for paying the remainder has closed, your best bet would be to file a claim at support.xsolla.com (or support and request either a new invoice to pay the remainder due or a refund of the insufficient payment.
I would strongly recommend that you download a wallet like Airbitz or Copay to handle your bitcoin! Virwox or any other exchange should only be used to purchase bitcoin which you should then transfer out to a wallet you control with better features. If you do this, however, be sure to backup your wallet!
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:38:48
While your bitcoin is stored on paper it's just as safe as a hardware wallet (when properly secured). With encryption, the paper wallet can be safer (at the cost of having to remember the password). Spending from paper requires importing or sweeping the private key into a hot wallet (most likely), so at *that* point it will be less safe than a hardware wallet, but you could then immediately transfer it into a hardware wallet address or back to paper.
I doubt one would want to use a single public address to store all their long-term savings. Therefore multiple paper wallets are necessary. In this sense, hardware wallets are more convenient, as are offline regular wallets backed up to paper.
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:00:25
Is it a valid address? Can you send the funds to your own address generated by a real wallet (e.g., Mycelium, Copay)? Are you trying to send more than your balance?

Well, it's usually not more complicated than typing in the total on a calculator-like interface and hitting a button, but I agree that main POS suite integration will be the best and eventual direction. Bitpay has several partnerships right now, in fact, along those lines which you can see here: 
Normally we don't want to ask a business to consider replacing their entire POS solution, so the add on phone/tablet method is usually the most cost-effective. If you're already using one of the products in that list, though, then it may be as simple as finding the option in settings or via a call to your provider.
An BTM would be cool, too! Bring in an extra hundred bucks per month (or more if its popular) just for a 2x2 floor space is not a bad idea. See CoinATMRadar.com for a list of operators already in your area.
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:53:53
Depends on the exact integration you are looking for: You can invoice customers after the purchase via email/other comm channels, you can have a "Pay with Bitcoin" static button, you can have a shopping cart plugin using WP or PrestaShop, you can host a widget from Mycelium Gear, or you can do an entirely custom solution using the Blockonomics.co API. All of these will not touch your bitcoin revenue but still rely on third-party servers. Others here can instruct you on how to do everything with a full node on your own servers.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:56:16

10 minutes is pretty common. The invoice can recalculate after that. Bitcoin Average USD or global rate is a good reference point, though many use BitStamp, Coinbase, or Bitpay.
You might look into the Blockonomics.co API for (custom) invoice creation and address tracking as well. It utilizes most existing, private wallets and does not ever touch your bitcoin revenue.

...except for whomever finds / reads your paper backups. Keep in mind physical security. Look into hardware wallets or securely generated paper wallets for larger, long-term storage.
Your private keys for your wallet are generated deterministically from those 12 words. Pretty much any HD wallet can generate the same keys from those 12 words, not just Electrum. Your wallet file is not stored anywhere except on your computer (and anyone who gains access to it). Your wallet file is encrypted with your password. Both the password and 12 word master seed need to be kept safe.
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:53:26

A 4% discount. I could have sworn it was 10% a few minutes ago. The discount is reflected in the exchange rate they use to calculate the bitcoin amount on the payment screen. Would be better if they show the 4% reflected on the checkout screen before final purchase once the customer selects Bitcoin as the payment method.

Use a mobile wallet like Airbitz, Copay, or Mycelium. Make a backup (of the user/pass in the case of Airbitz), then use the newly generated address to send funds after careful verification of the entire string at all stages of the transfer process. If you have bitcoin elsewhere I would test sending that to your new wallet, first, but it doesn't sound like you do.

I appreciate your thoughts. That is the biggest downside with Bitcoin usage on Etsy (and most other sites) without a separate escrow mechanism. However, if that were Etsy's primary concern I wouldn't think they'd allow "Other" payments to begin with.

Coinbase is like a bank--&gt; They hold your bitcoin (actually, *their* bitcoin) and give you an IOU/credit in exchange that is only valid within their (virtual) walls. You are a general creditor of their company. Only when you send your bitcoin credits out of their network does it become real bitcoin on the Bitcoin network and blockchain.
By contrast, when you use a wallet that generates its own private keys (Core/Unlimited, Electrum, Exodus, Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium, et al.), you and only you control *your* bitcoin. This means you take completely responsibility for their safety (BACKUP your master seed, no excuses!), but you also get to "be your own bank".
Bitcoin.org actually has a great wallet comparison page across platforms.

It can count as a multisig wallet if you generate a private key in a way Coinbase doesn't see or control. I'm not sure how that is done, but I've heard it's possible.
Normal Coinbase is, technically, a wallet, but better termed a web wallet or online account. You merely have an IOU from Coinbase promising to pay you bitcoin at a later date (when you send it out onto the actual Bitcoin network).

@_date: 2016-12-13 20:02:23
I'm also not sure about BitGo. You can safely reuse the same address and watch for the different transaction amounts to know which one paid, however, you might be better off either creating a new subaccount (does BitGo offer that?) or just downloading a new wallet (Airbitz, Mycelium, Copay) and using an address from one of those. Those wallets can also do subaccounts.
If you expect to be needing to invoice multiple people on a regular basis, using the Wallet Watcher on Blockonomics.co, especially with a connected xpub, would be a great way to generate hosted invoices with unique addresses on the fly.
@_date: 2016-11-18 04:31:15
If a wallet becomes deprecated, you should be able to move your funds well before they shut down. Worst case you could import your master seed into another BIP32 HD wallet. In the case of Airbitz they run on Electrum servers now, so if the developers shut down you should still have the ability to transact with your current version. The only thing that should be lost is the ability to create new Airbitz wallets.
No, just the 12 word seed can recover any amount of bitcoin in any amount of subaccounts. The app you're importing it into may not recognize all the subaccounts until you manually recreate them, but that, again, is a derivative process.
I recommend spreading your bitcoin across at least two wallets (preferably on different devices) to help mitigate some of these risks. Just be sure to backup all new wallets you create. Storage of large amounts should be done on hardware or paper wallets with a well thought out backup strategy.
@_date: 2016-12-31 20:49:49
Short answer: This is Coinbase's problem. Until they fix it either use a different wallet (Airbitz or Copay) or use the workaround at the bottom of this article.
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:34:45
Use a real wallet, not an online wallet, to store funds. Airbitz, Mycelium (Android-only), Copay, or Breadwallet (iOS-only) for mobile (best platform). Copay or Exodus on desktop.
BACKUP whichever wallet you choose!
Buy small amounts at a time, unless you've thought about your overall investment strategy.
Read basic and essential information on Bitcoin.org, Bitcoin.com, and Weusecoins.org.
Use a local ATM or a P2P marketplace for best privacy and faster speeds (but worst prices). Use an online exchange for best prices and convenience (but no privacy and slow speeds).
@_date: 2017-01-29 04:28:43
As a compromise until you become more familiar with private, hardware, and paper wallets, I recommend using Coinbase's Multisig Vault offering. All you will have to do is create a new password for the vault and print out a list of keys. This will bring you some of the benefits of private wallets but still within Coinbase's friendly interface.

You can accept Bitcoin directly for your business with Mycelium Gear, Blockonomics.co, or CoinSimple.com. With Blockonomics you can create invoices on the fly, without an account, and send the resulting URL off to your customers via any communications channel. They also have an API for integration. CoinSimple lets you create itemized bills and email them directly, but they don't really have a support team behind them these days. Mycelium Gear lets you create widgets to plug into your website for payment or donation.
With any of these options you would be receiving your bitcoin revenue directly to a wallet under your control (or not, if you use, say, a Coinbase). I'd recommend the Mycelium wallet (or Airbitz or Copay or all three). You can split funds between multiple wallets to avoid platform risk and, potentially, the risk of the compromise of any particular device. You can also store larger amounts on (securely generated) paper wallets or hardware wallets.
Let me know if you need further assistance! I love to help any merchant accept Bitcoin.

Would love to help you reconsider. Wait staff at restaurants like Southern Hospitality in Denver have been using Bitpay's POS app on phones for years with little issue. ...or if you want to accept directly, Quid POS or a wallet like Mycelium can do the same without security risk (receive-only devices). There are physical Bitcoin terminals as well. The staff would calculate and use totals entered in the main POS system as usual, with only having to select the method of payment chosen as "other" with a BTC note or cash with a BTC note (if there is no configurable option). Then they type that total into the app, bring up a QR code, present to the customer, and wait until the app reports an incoming payment. Once paid, mark the invoice as paid in the main POS.

Unfortunately, it looks like he setup a 2-of-2 wallet without an email address to receive either a 2FA change request nor the nlocktime file for his particular transactions.
To be honest, GreenAddress looks a bit convoluted and inelegant compared to BitGo or Coinbase's Multisig Vault where the user is prompted to print out his private keys (and must use at least 2-of-3).

Feel free to PM me if you'd like to discuss. Bitcoin is an alternative currency and a very special one. We hope it will become a major global money, which would likely result in a BTC/USD exchange rate far above $700. To whatever extent you can convert some of your speculative savings into Bitcoin, we often argue, will serve you better than holding dollars or many traditional investments. Besides the profit potential, there are political/economic reasons for wanting to encourage Bitcoin adoption, as well.
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:04:06
Most merchants will use whatever exchange rate their payment processors provide them (Coinbase, Bitpay, et.al.). Non-custodial / "direct-to-wallet" processors use external references, such as BitcoinAverage (Blockonomics.co) or allow you to select from several (CoinSimple).
If you're calculating manually for some reason or are choosing an exchange source in a wallet, I'd probably go with either Bitpay's BBB at the "low" end (which will net you more bitcoin and match what most Bitcoin customers pay) or BitcoinAverage.com (USD rate or global rate / GBX) for an arguable more fair reference rate.
*NOTE:* If you're looking for a simple invoicing solution that will pull the exchange rate at the time the customer pays (as opposed to when you create the invoice), then I would recommend Blockonomics.co. If you're looking to avoid BTC volatility as calculated in USD entirely, then you'd have to convert your earnings immediately into USD, so Bitpay or Coinbase (or maybe Coinapult Locks).
@_date: 2016-12-31 21:12:16
Short version: Use another wallet if you encounter either the "HTTP 400" or "amount mismatch" problem when using Mycelium or Breadwallet (Android) ...OR... use the workaround at the bottom of the article. This is Coinbase's problem, FYI, and not a wallet problem.
@_date: 2016-11-18 06:52:06
Sorry about the confusion. View the [Choose your wallet]( page on Bitcoin.org for a great comparison of your options. Note that we are basically saying you should avoid the "web" wallet category and go with a desktop, mobile, or hardware wallet.
More accurately, though, we are saying you need a wallet where the private keys are generated and stored only on the device you're using, itself, and not in anyone else's hands. Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium, Breadwallet, Exodus, and Electrum are ones I would recommend. Bitcoin is all about having complete control over your money, so trusting your bitcoin with others largely defeats the purpose. However, there are things to learn before making the jump. For one, you MUST have a backup of the 12 word seed or user/pass (Airbitz) on paper in a safe place. If something happens to your digital wallet this backup will be the only way to recover your funds. Also, be very careful when spending bitcoin, being sure you are sending to the correct address. Use small test amounts to verify until you have experience. You will lose your bitcoin if you send to an incorrect address.
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:23:06
Bitpay's BBB (lowest) or BitcoinAverage.com (Global Price [GBX] is the highest, while their "Currency Markets" USD price is more in between)

Congrats on deciding to accept!
Pretty much your best option is Bitpay.com if you wish to convert immediately to USD and have the option to both invoice customers and permit them to pay you in person.
If you're willing to hold onto your bitcoin revenue in the short term and sell it as needed later, then you'll have more options, but also a legal grey area in terms of reporting.
Also recommend a "Bitcoin Accepted Here" sign for the office. A few online shops sell these or you can print one yourself using public domain images.
Finally, be sure to list your acceptance at CoinMap.org, on the Airbitz.co directory, and look into adding the "Accepts Bitcoin" attribute to your Yelp page.
@_date: 2016-11-18 03:40:12
1. Download a wallet like Airbitz, Copay, or Mycelium (Android) to your phone.
2. Let it install and then WRITE DOWN your new 12 word seed onto paper stored securely. This is the only way you can recover your funds in case of a lost or damaged phone! Think about all the ways you could have that backup revealed to someone else or destroyed (flood, fire, etc.) and take precautions to reduce that risk. If you download Airbitz, write down your username and password, instead, and setup the password recovery inside the wallet.
3. Your new wallet will generate your first public address (a string of characters starting with "1"). Copy that string and switch to your Coinbase app or type that address carefully into a text field (notebook) on your PC.
4. Send a tiny, test amount to that new address by pasting it into the address field on Coinbase. You should see it show up in your new wallet.
5. Now, if that works, feel free to send the remainder to that same address or the new one your wallet generates.

How likely is it that a private key would be revealed? An important thing to point out, but overall seems to be overstating the risk. Any compromise that would reveal one private key would reveal them all or otherwise be no different than any other HD wallet hack. ...unless the xpub user likes throwing around private keys.

To add to 3: You might suggest Spendabit.co for online purchases, Gyft/eGifter/CardCash for gift cards, BitcoinAverage for price data, Purse for Amazon, and CoinMap/Airbitz/Yelp for locally accepting businesses (or do a search and list the best local merchants yourself). Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium, Breadwallet for wallets.

I agree with this advice. I'd also add that you should get comfortable with paper/physical storage because that's exactly how you're going backup your hardware wallet! Hardware wallets can be stolen or damaged too.
@_date: 2016-11-14 15:10:12
In most wallets (Mycelium, Breadwallet, Copay, et al.) the 12 word master seed is used to deterministically generate all the private and public key pairs that are stored on the wallet, itself. This let's you regenerate all those keypairs on a completely different device or a different HD wallet no matter what happens to the first wallet. This can all be done safely without needing the internet.
Needless to say keeping that 12 word backup secure is essential or someone else can easily steal your funds.
Airbitz works a little differently (but still securely) by storing an encrypted copy of your wallet on its servers. They don't have access to the wallet, but let you redownload it if you install on another device or use the trustless password recovery.

Short version: This isn't any wallet's fault, but Coinbase's problem. Mycelium simply doesn't handle the error as gracefully. Either use funds on a different wallet (like Airbitz or Jaxx like you did) temporarily, or use the workaround at the bottom of this article to bypass the problem. You can still scan a QR code with the workaround method.
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:54:07
There's a backlog (possible spam attack) on the network right now. Your funds are safe. If the transaction never confirms you will still have control in the originating wallet. If you need it sooner, you could export the private key for the related address and import it into a different wallet, then resend the transaction with a higher fee.

This is really an excellent comparison! Great job!
I did my own test just now with Coinify versus Bitpay and BitcoinAverage and found that their rate on a $10 USD invoice was ~1.5% below Bitpay's BBB and ~2% below BitcoinAverage. That's how Coinify can advertise "zero fees" to the merchant, because they make their client's customers pay for it up front. That's a fine business model if they want it, but it should be made clear to their client. Merchants can easily think they're getting services for "free" when they're really not. To Coinify's credit, though, the merchant can opt-in to the market rate + processing fee in settings, however there is still no indication of what that fee would be.
BitcoinPay was worse in my previous test, having withheld 0.00025 without explanation and virtually no indication on their site.
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:46:57
Not using built-in means. You'd have to take the master seed and plug it into an offline(!) file or text encyption software that could do that for you, then store the result however you like.

If .034044 BTC was truly the original amount, then you underpaid by .003484 with your original transaction (linked above) of .03056. That's close to the requested additional amount of 0.003.
The problem is most likely Virwox. If you use a mobile or desktop wallet (see Bitcoin.org) you can scan the requested QR code directly or click the link to remove user error. Virwox may also be deducting fees from your transfer. They are not intended to be used as a regular wallet.
My apologies for the trouble, but for now here is what you need to do going forward:
1. Download a wallet like Airbitz or Electrum (see more at Bitcoin.org) and properly back it up.
2. Transfer any remaining bitcoin from Virwox to your new wallet using the address it gives you.
3. Submit a support request to Xsolla or to the gaming site explaining the situation and asking to be refunded your transaction amount. Be sure to give them an address from your new wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-24 07:18:01
They may be asking for an exchange (like Coinbase or Bitstamp) to send your revenue to. I would think they would offer a payout via a static address, but I haven't played with them yet.
Depending on your integration method, you may benefit from Blockonomics.co, Mycelium Gear, or CoinSimple.
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:46:05
Coinbase is a major competitor, though not for in-person POS solutions. GoCoin is another. There are a few more of these exchange-based payment service providers as well.
I would recommend non-custodial Bitcoin payment processors whenever possible, such as those on BTC_Forever's list, but it ultimately depends on what you're looking for.

Only from the viewpoint of dollars. If you held that 1 BTC and the customer requests a refund, why are they not entitled to it back? If bitcoin is 700 and drops to 500, your incentives are obviously reversed.
Perhaps we could agree that whatever the merchant decides, having a clear, consistent refund policy is important.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:24:56
Technically, yes, via Paxful.com and the Pay with Paxful button, but it won't be inexpensive for your payers.

You can also connect with a local operator to place them, often earning a finders fee. ...or start your own operation, but I'd research local MSB requirements and create an AML/KYC program. Alternatively just run one yourself, but take the risk of legal trouble.
I'd recommend Genesis Coin machines for future expansion, but Lamassu or General Bytes (or even the tiny BitTeller units) might be best if you're just getting started.
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:43:19
Keep trying. If you contacted Xsolla try the game site or vice versa. Make sure they understand that they have already received .03056 BTC and you need either a refund or credit. It's possible Xsolla has already forwarded this onto the game site and they are who you need to deal with.
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:41:22

On top of Bitcoin-Yoda's comments I would add:
The Airbitz mobile app is very good for generating payment requests and acting like a basic POS for in-person transactions.
Blockonomics.co has a convenient P2P invoicing feature where you can generate a private invoice URL to share in correspondence. Just paste an address into the search bar or add an xpub to a Wallet Watcher account.
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:17:07
That wouldn't be dynamic / wouldn't produce new payment addresses for each transaction. Address reuse is definitely frowned upon for privacy reasons, and it can be harder to match payments to individual customers. A little over a year ago we didn't even have HD wallets on mobile devices, so we've come a long way.

Lovely! Coin Of Sale is an in-person POS provider only, but that's actually a rarer find. Mycelium, Copay, and now Coin of Sale are the only ways I know to do retail POS transactions on devices that don't hold the private keys and which also don't involve third-party handling of your funds. In addition, Coin Of Sale is the only one of those three to focus on the merchant POS experience with their interface design.

Have no idea how to answer your second question, but I first heard about Bitcoin (as did a lot of people) during the Cypress bail-in of early 2013. Spent the summer reading and learding about it, then bought my first in the fall. It was already pretty much too late to mine by then, and I was concerned more with Bitcoin adoption than making a quick buck. I imagine many also heard about it during the media explosion over the price exceeding $1000 at the end of 2013.

UPDATE: [Coin Of Sale]( is a retail (in-person) POS services provider with dynamic address generation that allows you to connect your own BIP 32 HD wallet and receive funds directly. Unlike Mycelium or Copay, Coin Of Sale has designed its interface for the merchant POS environment and is platform-independent--running as a browser app on your terminal of choice (very much like BitPay).

If there are not too many addresses with positive balances (or one or two that will make up the amount you need), you can open those private keys in Armory offline and copy them to wallets that allow single private key import or private key sweeping (Mycelium, BC.info, not sure about Electrum, likely others...).
You can ask this question on the Armory forums as well (I think it has come up a lot there).
Keep in mind, also, that the newest version of Armory plus Bitcoin Core v0.10 or higher have much faster sync times and reliability, but a full blockchain download is still possible.

Outstanding! Just in the last hour I've discovered two other direct-to-wallet merchant services providers besides Mycelium Gear for e-commerce applications and this is one of them (Coinkite is another). CoinSimple generates your payment front-end, but lets you choose your own HD wallet (Electrum, Armory, Trezor), a fixed address, or even one of the other payment processors (Bitpay, et al.) on the backend. Only an email address and business name is required (at first glance, at least).

Use Mycelium or Copay to accept bitcoin from customers, in a retail environment or in-person, while keeping your private keys on your own private phone or PC. This lessens the risk of someone stealing your POS terminal and spending your bitcoin. It also doesn't require a third-party, like Bitpay or Coinbase, to act as a payment intermediary.

Perhaps a better term is "non-custodial". This is the first time a "Bitcoin by email" service has been created which does not expose the sender or receiver to counterparty risk of loss due to theft. This fits in with our other non-custodial payment processing and address tracking services that we've offered for a while. We appreciate your thoughts and will continue to hack on it and refine the messaging.
Note that only one part of the private key is sent via email (unencrypted). The other half is the redemption link which the sender is free to communicate in any other form. We highly recommend that senders deliver the redemption link via a separate, secure channel (encrypted chat/email or at least a different, unencypted platform) to reduce the risk of theft or man-in-the-middle on the receiver's end. This is also a capability unique to our solution.

Good point, but I would also worry about Coinbase, et al., expanding off-chain "bitcoin" via the good ol' practice of fractional reserves. After all, the dollar used to have a hard link to gold.

Hello Syntiskar! Thanks for adding Bitcoin as a payment method!
If you are just accepting in-person when the guest checks-in then a regular bitcoin wallet is fine. If you'd prefer to have it on a business tablet or a computer screen, then that's always possible; just ask. Airbitz is good for prompting notation, if desired, for each transaction, FYI.
If you are looking to immediately exchange received bitcoin revenue into local currency deposited in your business bank account, you'd have to sign up with one of a few exchanges. In the US, Bitpay is likely the best option with free conversion and some of the best merchant tools in the business. If you don't need to convert right away, then just accept directly and worry about exchange when needed.
If you accept reservations through an online system, this gets more tricky. Assuming you don't have web developers on call to integrate external APIs, the best option may be manual invoicing and confirmation of the reservation via email.
Once you figure out the technical integration solution, you should be sure to advertise your acceptance on Airbitz, Coinmap, and Yelp. I'd also recommend putting up a Bitcoin Accepted Here sticker or window cling as a physical advertisement.
Finally, if you are enthusiastic about Bitcoin and want to encourage adoption, I'd recommend seriously considering a discount for guests who pay with Bitcoin. There is no greater incentive for customers to make the transition to crypto than direct monetary savings. I just heard recently about a gentleman getting now 30% of his customer base to pay him with Bitcoin in order to capture his 10% discount, which he offsets by purchasing supplies on Purse.io (CardCash.com is another offset source). His is far from the typical crypto user demographic, as well.
Let me know if you have any questions about any of this.
@_date: 2016-09-20 04:07:57
: I assume you want to maintain your business Bitcoin integration as well as manage your existing funds, but do you accept via an online shopping cart / invoice or in-person? There are alternatives for online or invoice acceptance that send the bitcoin revenue straight to your own private wallet--largely removing the middleman and the limitations of their compliance departments. Tell me more about what you want to do.
@_date: 2016-09-19 23:55:22
I think it's a minor risk to switch it on, throw up a Bitcoin Accepted Here logo and sticker, and see what happens. If you already have interested customers then I think it's a no-brainer. It would be costless for you to accept besides having to answer the odd question or two.

If you are looking to sell some or all of your Bitcoin income for local currency, BitPay or Coinbase have both shopping cart plugins, hosted checkout pages, invoicing, and API access as well as mobile merchant apps for Android that will cover you whether your sales are online or off.
If you don't expect much in the way of Bitcoin sales, you otherwise don't want automatic conversions to fiat, or you want greater flexibility in backend services, I recommend [CoinKite]( or [CoinSimple]( for online sales, and [Coin Of Sale]( or a standard mobile wallet for in-person sales. You can also create a mobile POS on Android that will not actually store the bitcoin you receive (no private keys) for greater security in case of physical theft/damage. Additionally, CoinSimple is designed to provide frontend payment services and invoicing while giving you the option to connect to BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin and others on the backend for exchange into fiat. This gives you the flexibility to change the backend while keeping the same website integration.
I'd be happy to work with you further on service evaluation and implementation, and I have experience with in-person merchant integration, as well. Just send me a message.

A Bitcoin ATM may be the best solution on the buyer's side. Otherwise, localbitcoins or an equivalent in-person exchange.
You can generate invoices easily with Coinbase or BitPay and probably other merchant services companies, or generate the payment request yourself using any wallet (Airbitz is especially good at this). Then you can send the request and confirm it via a secondary communications channel or use encrypted communications (Telegram, Signal, GPG).

Indeed, but your example touches upon how most Americans *think* of their dollars in their accounts--as physical bills sitting *somewhere* ready to be pulled out whenever they choose. This is the lineage of fiat money, having once existed as precious metals, then as convertible money substitutes, then as irredeemable fiat tokens, but still something that people believe someplace, somehow must have backing. This casual misunderstanding about modern money is the enabler of debasement and of fractional reserves, for which the former Bitcoin is well positioned to solve.

Not really, though. The extent to which mining is securing the network and making Bitcoin possible is a factor going into why people value Bitcoin, but not a direct cause. Remember, value is imputed up the chain of production from consumer goods to production goods all the way up to basic resource inputs. A given area of farmland has X value not because of its properties, intrinsically-speaking, but because Y &amp; Z crops with present and future expected market prices can be grown on this land. Y &amp; Z crops have value because of the demand for direct consumption and as inputs into other products which all have their own demand, and so on....

Good point. In struggling to grasp why Bitcoin is being used and how it can exist, people may be more likely to pick up on concepts such as the distinction between money and wealth and how value is always subjective and not intrinsic.

Really appreciate this analysis! Your points are valid and I'm glad to see full-node backed business integration getting this kind of write-up. The process of running your own full node connected to your website or store terminal is rather complicated, however, even for someone like me: a non-programmer, but one who has been following and testing Bitcoin merchant solutions for over two years.
I have been pushing for more of a compromise:  Permissionless merchant acceptance via various third-party services, including regular wallets themselves. After all, basic wallet software writers are trusted third parties.
**Uptime**: The biggest downside, I think, of relying upon the selection of merchant services we have today is that you're at the mercy of their server uptime and code reliability, but even using a regular non-SPV wallet is dependent on their server network (and privacy implications). However, because the services I recommend are permissionless, one can implement a fall-back strategy to one or the other just as easily, or even to a backup, full fiduciary like Coinbase or Bitpay. Business owners today are used to managing centralized payment uptime risk via credit card PSPs and POS SaaS, never mind the privacy and security concerns of those.
**Privacy**: This is also a big concern that a full node would best address, but there are numerous levels of privacy leakage one can consider, and convenience tradeoffs can be made. An SPV or non-SPV wallet isn't as private, but a heck of a lot better than the exchanges or regular fiat PSPs. A CoinSimple or Blockonomics will know which transactions you generate with them, or even your entire xpub history if you choose, but there are strategies: It's possible to use anonymous logins with Blockonomics and track addresses you don't own, or just generate individual invoices with single receive addresses. Likewise, CoinSimple has no business verification so you can setup as many accounts and sub-accounts as you wish. Gear and Electrum Merchant also have applications here. Unlike Coinbase, Bitpay and other Bitcoin merchant exchanges, these solutions don't act as a fiduciary. Leading me to....
**Censorship Resistance**: Because these solutions are "direct-to-wallet" they don't have AML/KYC compliance rules or identity verifications. They don't analyze your transactions for suspicious behavior. They don't (normally) care what business or non-business you are running. Entities excluded from traditional Bitcoin PSPs are welcome on these services. Bitcoin revenue is either directly paid to your private wallet or immediately (programmatically) forwarded to your wallet, depending on your solution.
I don't like the trend I am seeing with the traditional merchant exchanges, therefore I would encourage anyone to look into the direct-to-wallet options below, even if only as an intermediate solution before full node integration. Feel free to message me for assistance:
* [Blockonomics.co]( - Full API plus hosted invoicing with or without an account
* [CoinSimple]( - Payment buttons and hosted invoicing plus a few e-commerce plugins and a mobile app for in-person POS
* [QuidPOS]( - Web and mobile-based full register app with or without an account, featuring integrations with numerous payment processors including direct-to-wallet Bitcoin. Also including innovations like ShapeShift and BlockCypher inclusion and instant multicurrency conversion. Still in early development, however; needing testers to help refine their offering.
* Not recently tested by myself: CoinOfSale for in-person POS, Electrum Merchant, Mycelium Gear, and the other options presented in this thread (thanks guys!)

I did some further digging. Starting with [THIS]( post and following from that in the BitcoinTalk thread, "stick" from SatoshiLabs describes the trouble he was getting into with the OSM community and why he decided to no longer use OSM after the update. He, confusingly, suggests that OSM nodes would still be reflected in CoinMap, but later says they won't. My experience shows they will not.
Others were also disappointed by this change and suggested alternatives. CoinMap does have an API now if apps want to build on top of this database, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Sorry for the trouble. I actually work with XBTeller here in Colorado. Normally, a 2-way Genesis Coin machine will have a "Sell Bitcoin" button on the screen when it is stocked with cash. If you only see "Buy" and "Redeem" buttons then it doesn't have cash available to sell.

Why do you say TOR is the only safe way, if I may ask?
@_date: 2016-10-21 05:53:07
You have several options depending on how you want to accept and if you want to convert some or all of your Bitcoin revenue into local currency. It's really quite easy, though, and you can begin by just downloading a wallet to your personal phone (or creating a new subaccount of an existing wallet).
Once you decide on a method of acceptance, you should advertise on coinmap.org and airbitz.co--two of our best physical merchant directories. Create an announcement here, also, and even think about contacting a local news organization for an interview. You should also place a Bitcoin Accepted Here sign or cling in your shop and on your website, if applicable.
Finally, if you want to encourage people to use Bitcoin and learn more about it, I'd seriously consider offering a discount for bitcoin payments. 3-15%, for example, which can be offset by purchasing some supplies on Amazon via Purse or CardCash.com.
Thanks for being a part of this grand experiment and giving your customers a better choice in payments. :)

I haven't really heard of pawn shops accepting or exchanging Bitcoin, but, unless there are some industry-specific rules I am unaware of, I'd say it should be just as possible as any other retailer. Actually, their existing AML/KYC program might make it easier for them to setup exchange, though it's likely easier / better for them to exchange through an operator like LibertyX or to host a BTM.
They should be able to accept BTC easily via the same processing options other merchants have: Bitpay or Coinbase for automatic conversion; basic wallets, CoinSimple, CoinOfSale for permissionless acceptance.

Thanks for the reply, James. That page and video is very nice, but we're still lacking guidelines for integrations with existing terminals already in use with another PSP / for other payment methods. A list of compatible Ingenico models would be helpful as well.
See, from my perspective as one who works to expand Bitcoin retail acceptance, I would be *thrilled* to have the ability to say, "Hey, your credit card terminal there can be setup with Bitcoin in just a few steps," or "One option we have is to replace your existing terminal with one that would work with both Bitcoin and all your existing card processing needs."
@_date: 2015-09-17 04:12:40
Wonderful, my good sir! Kudos to you!
May I suggest that your response stating that Bitcoin acceptance would not cost the Treasurer / State any more money might be easy to challenge. Legal examinations, technical examinations, procedural setup and training, exchange evaluation and selection, etc. are all extra costs over the status quo. Perhaps phrasing it that Bitcoin costs far less to accept than other "commodities", if they prefer that category, and is completely unique with users all over the globe. NH would do well to begin learning how to deal with it now as a competitive advantage over other states (as is your theme).

Less complicated than Gear; quicker than BC.i to get setup, especially with the wizard. Great option for ecommerce merchants and app builders looking for permissionless payment tools.


Anyone in need of occasional Bitcoin payment requests to third-parties (invoicing) can also use Blockonomics.co with a single public address; no need to even sign into the Wallet Watcher (which can also be anonymous).
Feel free to contact me for personalized assistance. I've been working with Blockonomics and related tools for quite a while. Would love to help people realize new, permissionless ways to accept bitcoin.

I would claim that, besides the various bans and confiscations in U.S. history, gold specie--as a medium of exchange / currency--lost favor to paper notes (including warehouse receipts) due to the significantly increased convenience that paper money and token change offered. The main theory for how fiat money came into widespread use was that people became used to the convenience of money substitutes, including checking deposits, but still believed there was a gold backing and that that they could ultimately acquire gold if they went far enough. Those backend links were slowly removed.
My understanding, from most Austrians I've read up until Bitcoin, was that the inevitable failure of fiat would lead to a return to a gold-based currency and, possibly, a full-reserve currency due to the newly widespread understanding of monetary theory that the collapse of fiat would provoke. Perhaps a kind of understanding that would prevent the mistakes of past gold standards from repeating themselves.
Bitcoin offers a gold-like (or even better) form of money with aspects of convenience and control in the digital age unmatched by even modern fiat. The ability to "take delivery" of my bitcoin out of one bank and keep it "under my mattress", no matter the amount, or transfer it to someone half-way around the world without shipping and insurance or delay should be a gold-bug's dream come true. The only thing Bitcoin can't yet match is gold's history of reliability and independence.
@_date: 2015-11-17 04:34:39
I don't know.... Bitcoin is the first real world, widespread modern day test of Austrian / Rothbardian ideal money in competition with modern fiat. It's as significant a leap forward for monetary theory as it is for computer science.

Brings up a good question: Does RBF implementation change the likelihood that a "non-RBF" (max value nSequence) transaction can be double-spent?
If a post-RBF node sees a higher-fee double-spend of a max value nSequence transaction already in its mempool, does it drop the newer transaction as it does now?
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:37:03
That's why anyone accepting zero-conf for quick exchange of goods / services will, as a best practice, require RBF transactions to wait until confirmation and request that the sender replace the transaction with a non-RBF for faster checkout flow.
There will be fraud opportunities in the transition, however.

If you need automatic conversion to USD, then I'd recommend either Coinbase or Bitpay, who will also provide you with the code or button to place on your website for integration. A donor will simply click the link and be presented with a custom bitcoin payment address that will go to your account. You can choose whatever percentage you want to keep as bitcoin.
If you don't have a need for instant exchange into USD, I recommend Coinkite or CoinSimple. Both of these will give you the tools to present dynamic addresses on your website, but you retain control of the donated bitcoin at all times.
There's no automatic forwarding / conversion service to Paypal that I know of, and, like others here, I recommend against posting a static address for privacy reasons.

@_date: 2015-11-29 20:53:04
The idea is that wallet software will roll out updates that would detect and alert the user if an RBF transaction is received, but, yes, there exists a window for fraud during the transition if people blindly accept zero-conf payments as good.
@_date: 2015-11-29 20:43:53
I think it should be / will be merchant policy to reject all RBF transactions as a non-payment unless it confirms before any other action can be taken. In the case where an RBF-capable transaction has been sent and both parties are now in confirmation limbo, the merchant can request that the customer replace that transaction with a non-RBF equivalent (at a higher fee, of course). The second transaction will eventually confirm instead of the old one and will be acknowledged at the merchant POS under normal zero-conf rules.
I could see the usual Bitcoin payment processors walking the operator and customer through these steps. Depending on how well the customer understands what's going on, the typical delay for accidental RBF payments could be reduced to a minute or less over standard zero-conf. Otherwise, the merchant should force the wait for confirmation before completing the exchange, incentivizing the customer to learn more about RBF and how to turn it off.

Thanks for all the responses to questions in this thread! I applaud your development. Seems like an excellent increase in usability from the Bitcoin holder's perspective, but no different than a bitcoin exchange-funded debit card (like Xapo) from the merchant's POV. In other words, this won't really impact merchant adoption because they have no way of knowing that it's not Apple Pay or some other NFC-powered storehouse of regular credit/debit cards. Merchants will still pay 2-3% in fees and the system, overall, will still have to deal with transmission and storage of sensitive payment information.
If this works, it will be a major benefit nonetheless.
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:12:11
Another example: Airbitz will store your encrypted wallet on its servers, allowing you to easily install the same wallet on two phones or grab it again if something happens to your current phone. This is the easiest way for anyone to retain ownership of their bitcoin along with a backup strategy, but you need a good passphrase.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:34:49
I believe Andreas is correct on emphasis, as there is more potential in cross-border / cross-currency trade as well as general e-commerce security advantages to Bitcoin at this early stage, but I feel like this would be a good conversation starter for what we can actually do for physical merchant adoption in the developed world (especially in the U.S.).
* What are some of the best in-person merchant adoption success stories we have?
* What conditions / areas make for the most likely adoption scenarios and greatest bitcoin sales volume?
* How can we better focus our efforts on physical merchants likely, not just to integrate, but to find value in their adoption?
Speaking as an enthusiast out of the Denver, Colorado area, our biggest success story has come from a couple of full-service BBQ restaurants; the first is located in downtown Denver and sees about one transaction per week. They also host our local meetup group every month.
However, it seems the college towns surrounding Denver are also natural hotspots for Bitcoin adoption. The highest traffic here most likely coming from coffee shops.

My understanding is that all the merchants out there, even just the ones using Ingenico terminals, still have various payment services providers (PSPs) who would have to specifically choose to offer Bitcoin integration and push it to their client devices for what you describe to work. A Bitpay account is needed so that the terminal knows who to talk to (thus, why it needs a direct connection to the internet) and so that Bitpay knows who to pay (what business, what bank account).
Bitpay is also customizing the software on these devices themselves (loading their own app), thus why the suggested route is to order a terminal from them. It is unclear whether or not a merchant with an existing terminal can modify it themselves.
@_date: 2015-10-01 05:01:30
Yeah, I've been disappointed with how slow many of them have been to embrace it. Too many decades arguing for a full-reserve gold standard, I guess, or really just needing a younger, tech-savvy generation of Austrians who are more likely to appreciate the crypto and open source stuff. We have Robert Murphy onboard, though! ;)

ATM manufacturers feel the need to create hardware that support a variety of regulatory compliance requirements in various jurisdictions around the world. For example, where Lamassu may get away with selling a machine without any AML/KYC features in some countries, they need to support those features in the U.S. The BTM operators buying these machines are demanding hardware that will fulfill the requirements they have to satisfy or they'll go to a manufacturer who does. Therefore, facial recognition is a "feature" that BitAccess is all too happy to advertise.
Many times, various buy or sell requirements can be customized by the operator to suit whatever needs they have as a business. I was involved in the setup of a Genesis Coin machine where the operator customized the levels of verification needed for different purchase amount tiers.
So, my point is, basically, any time Bitcoin has to interface with fiat you are going to run into these hurdles. I suppose our goal as supporters is to expand the Bitcoin economy far enough that we will no longer need to get in and out of fiat much.

By default, Coinbase Vault is just like the regular account plus extra rules on withdrawal / sending that slow down the process. Only if you generate your own private key separately for the multisig functionality would Coinbase not have the ability to move the funds on their own.

I like this. It didn't occur to me last night that either a replacement transaction sent to "undo" an attempted RBF payment (followed by a non-RBF regular transaction) OR a replacement non-RBF transaction spending the same inputs with a higher fee could be quickly initiated by the customer once the Bitcoin POS on the merchant side alerts on the original RBF spend.
* If the original transaction happens to confirm before either form of replacement transaction is transmitted, the merchant POS will be able to detect successful payment with confirmation. The exchange can then be fulfilled with minimal delay.
* If the original transaction takes longer to confirm then a replacement transaction can be sent, the replacement will appear to the merchant POS as a "normal" unconfirmed transaction with a higher fee, processed as per usual rules. Users should still learn over time not to attempt an RBF transaction for quick payments.
The transition period may still be difficult, with some wallets and POS systems not RBF aware, but it looks like my main objection can be quickly remedied.

Align, apparently, enables businesses to track their payments to other businesses (the receiver can do the same) like we can track UPS or Fedex packages. They do this for international and domestic payments charging just 1.9% per transaction (or $15 per month in some cases).

In Colorado I've used BTMs recently that were very diverse in their UX design:
1. A Lamassu machine that was incredibly elegant, requiring nothing but a destination QR address and inserted bills. [buy-only]
2. A BitAccess machine that required a phone number and SMS challenge before buy or sell, with the sell process poorly designed. [buy/sell]
3. A GenesisCoin machine requiring a phone number/SMS challenge, pin code, and ID scanning before you can buy a single satoshi. [buy-only]
...but these traits are a combination of manufacturing and operator choices. Apparently, even the type of mobile number you enter may also determine the required steps (contract vs prepaid).

I think it is. We're going to have to endure several more bubbles in Bitcoin before it can do what most of us hope it will. Any sustained, gradual rise in price is always noticed and jumped on, over correcting to the upside followed by an inevitable crash, but Bitcoin finds a new higher level. There is no other way for a new money, not force-pegged to another, to bootstrap itself into common use. This doesn't mean Bitcoin will make it, but it's the path it has to travel if it does.

My post above was all about in-person acceptance in, say, a physical retail store or vending site where you wouldn't really need to identify the user. You can do e-commerce with dynamic addressing and self-control of funds thanks to providers such as CoinSimple and Coinkite, as well as DIY Mycelium Gear. Normally, the shopping cart software will record the customer's name and address for fulfillment purposes with a Bitcoin plugin or hosted checkout page as the very last step.
If you're wanting to know how a watching-only wallet can know that it's been paid and alert the cashier: They keep track of transactions sent to their addresses, just like a full wallet. You can see address and overall wallet balances using a watching-only wallet; it's just that you can't spend any of the amounts.

Excellent article. Still, the Ingenico news is a positive step. It may encourage processors already offering these machines to push the capability themselves.

Loving this. Five upvotes for the whole post @_date: 2015-10-14 06:25:30

Granted, but it ends up being easier for me (not a workday).

I agree; questions need answers: 
* Can a merchant using an Ingenico terminal choose to accept Bitcoin without their payment processor specifically supporting it? 
* Would they need a separate BitPay account to do this?

.00005 will exclude some common wallet transactions, won't it? I'm just glancing at my own recent Airbitz and Copay transactions and both of them vary wildly but frequently get as low as .000025 BTC.
This is why I set my node to relay at .00002

I don't get it. The author is the CEO of Blade Payments, whose website doesn't really describe what clients it's seeking or how Blade can increase customer and merchant adoption.
Bitcoin debit cards? The only advantage here is for existing Bitcoin holders / earners who want to spend bitcoin on existing debit/credit networks. There is some market here, but it doesn't seem to be that big.
What uninterested merchants need, ideally, is not to have to deal with Bitcoin at all. The various PSPs they already contract with for debit/credit services should simply provide Bitcoin as another payment option. Unfortunately, that may be in conflict with the agreements PSPs have with VISA and MC.
Perhaps an open source POS system for merchants is a better option that can plug in any PSP as needed while still utilizing a single interface and transaction ledger.

If only Bitcoin wasn't "a solution looking for a problem."

Why is it a worse experience paying with Bitcoin? The EMV chip readers we're now forced to use in the States actually provide a slower experience in many cases than a proper Bitcoin merchant app.

"Bitcoin Wallet" for Android is one. Mycelium intends to have this capability soon.

I agree. For me what matters is how much we can increase minrelaytxfee before it starts filtering common wallet transactions. Just looking at the recent transaction history of Airbitz, Copay and others, several were given fees below 0.0001; I think a few were even 0.000025.
I'm going to increase to 0.00002, first, and see how my node holds up.

Hello mobskins. Thanks for looking into Bitcoin acceptance!
Bitpay, Coinbase, GoCoin, etc are convenient, full service options for e-commerce integration. Their main advantages are being well developed with lots of tools and support, and they offer the ability to exchange a percentage of your bitcoin revenue automatically and send directly to your bank account. If you're looking for immediate conversion, then you'd most likely want one of these service providers.
If you intend to keep your bitcoin or manually exchange them later, I'd recommend CoinKite.com or CoinSimple.com. Both of these companies provide front-end integration and processing while permitting you choice on the backend, even if you decide you want to exchange to fiat later. The best part: You can set it up so that you are always in control of your bitcoin revenue, removing all middlemen (even briefly), and permitting you to use these services with fewer restrictions and no chance for lost or frozen funds. They require less information from you, as well.
Mycelium Gear is even farther along these lines, but potentially harder to setup.

Hi there. Can you contact webmaster (at) blockonomics.co for support on this issue? He would be glad to assist you.

The free version seems to be in "goatpig"'s hands for now.

Maybe an online converter like  ?
There are apps that do this as well.

1.  Airbitz can do manual backups, but mainly relies on the automatic encypted backup to their servers. This means that as soon as you create your first wallet it is already backed up in a sense--capable of being restored on any other phone using the same username and password.
Other wallets like Mycelium or Copay require you to write down or otherwise store the master seed, which can then be used to recover the wallet.
I can't speak to Android security, but large amounts should always be stored offline (hardware or paper wallets).

I love it when I run across a simple Bitcoin donation option, as well. There is no reason every non-profit should not accept Bitcoin.
