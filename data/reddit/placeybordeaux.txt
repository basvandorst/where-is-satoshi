It's basically given that china has created fake certs by using trusted CAs

Has something recently happened?

How would that even work? What would the advantage be over just DIY?

This is why people view the bitcoin community as a bunch of 17 year old loons.
@_date: 2014-07-13 13:04:22
I can't believe how many people like this. This looks terrible from the outside in my opinion.

It's not really all for nothing, but the amount of blocks you reasonably need to wait to confirm a tx goes up almost arbitrarily high. This isn't a problem if you trust the sender or are dealing with comparatively low txs.
It's extremely bad for the currency, but it's not like a 51% or 75% attack can manufacturer txs. Many implementations also won't relay a block that is too old, so it's unlikely that an attacker with majority compute power can actually roll back arbitrarily far.

Not exactly what you asked for, but the berklyDB bug caused a hard fork in bitcoin it's self. It was rectified by community intervention.

It was well worth 5 bucks for me. It is not very funny and largely a dark drama about a dysfunctional family that has run a bar for 100 years.

This isn't about netflix.

Why was discussion about the hard fork due to a bug in berkleyDB allowed?

Bitcoin will not go to zero until a better technology comes out or a fatal vulnerability is discovered.

no one is claiming that /dev/urandom is defective. It is more secure than jiggling your mouse or slamming on your keyboard.

This is almost assuredly how it works. It really seems like a lot of people in don't understand how credit cards work and what their advantages are. Uber's UX depends on how credit cards work, they probably wouldn't want to have to deal with the effort that bitcoin would require.

The solidness of the technology is not what dictates the price of the good.

Just because people invested it doesn't make it a good product.

If they want to build a platform to enable M2M transactions on bitcoin thats cool. I just think that building this dev kit splits their concerns and makes this all more confusing. Releasing a script to transform a raspberry pi thats cool.
The thing is that their [entire site]( is set up not to look like a dev kit but to sell units as fast as possible. In fact the thing that people on this subreddit have talked about the most is a singular refrence to a micropayment server, which is never expanded upon.

They seem to be selling hype and a machine that comes preinstalled with bitcoin.
What makes this machine better than any other machine that you have installed bitcoin on?

What tax bracket are you in?

Why is this so highly upvoted? This is a terrible product.

This subreddit gets more insane by the day.

I think the problem with Keynesian economics is that it believes that spending resources is better than not spending resources. I don't see how it is responsible for the wealth disparity in the world though.

Nodes are important for relaying tx to other nodes as well.

So you are claiming that LN will allow for people to create bitcoin backed assets and then get people to accept their asset at a price that would value all of the asset at a higher rate than they initally locked up in bitcoin?
I'm not sure if that's actually possible, but what you're proposing isn't an argument against LN.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:45:21
How is this related to LN?
@_date: 2017-05-20 02:32:17


What? How are LN channels and smart contacts similar to "fractional reserve trading"?

It's really that there hasn't been a libritrian canidate that has a reasonable understanding of when government spending makes sense. If a canidate can win the libertarian primary then they are sufficiently dogmatic to lose the general.
