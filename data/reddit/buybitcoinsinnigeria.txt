Thanks a lot and to every body. I have learnt my lessons today and I wont be Bitcoining again after learning this.. The repairer sent the bTC back to one of my accounts this morning when I woke up. This is a miracle though I was going to go publick in the area,
a small town. 
This is micracle once again. I have sent all the bTC to LBC and selling all of them right away. I won't be bitcoining for now.
Thanks a lot.
I woke up this morning to see it being sent back to

That address is not mine. That is the address where the stolen  1.5BTC was sent to by the thief. Please what could be wrong. I have a strong feeling it's the repairer I gave my PC to recently...
This was stolen from Bitcoin Core..

No, the repairer even called me on the phone and told me that he restored all the files and saved all the blocks in another file. Meaning he has a copy of the blocks  and wallet.dat somewhere before transfering it back to the computer.
Any reparier could easily restore all your files back.. I did password Bitcoin core, this happened in the month of may.. And BTC got stolen today.

Thanks a million times. I really appreciate the little time you took out of your precious time in giving unbiased analysis of the situation.
I always deep scan to find out if ANy keylogger is being installed, I dont click on links from emails and I have AVG Antivirus activated so Keylogger may not happen to me.
It's 100% glaring that it was from my repairer testing his hacking skills and I score him 3 out of 5.
What he did was quite simple. He made up brute force program to guess the password cos he found a hint in one of the files he restored.  Assuming the password i used was 'content65'. I wrote a hint like this co.....65  So he knew what and what to look for. And for one month of using Brute force is too much to have permutated the right combination to get the missing 'ntent'.
The password I used was just 8 figures.

Thanks a lot.. You are 100% right. I woke up this morning to see a miracle indeed. It was sent back to one of my addresses. I have sent all of them to LBC and sold everything right away.
Not bitcoining again. Thanks for your great time. I really appreciate it. I hope others will learn from mine. Thanks a million times.
What I learnt is always use a very strong password. USE a computer generated password and also do not give your computer out to a repairier you do not Trust..

You are right about that. A month is enough to guess my password for real as there were lot of hints in some of the files he restored plus it was not hard password.  He must have been trying it for over a month until today.

I am suspecting the repairer 90%. I did a pc scan, checked PID to see all established connections and could not find any unregistered malware, trojan or anything like that via the CMD netstat -ano command and Task Manager.

I have learnt my lesson the hard way.. I am now changing all my passwords, APPs, BANK,Social media to a very hard computer generated password. Before I was scared I would forget this long generated computer password but now, I have to cram it right away.

No, i did not drop admin password as I could not login to the main admin when I tried to update the PC and it was taking long to login into the admin. After the update, my admin profile got corrupted. The main Admin where BTC core is got corrupted. I tried to sort the issue myself but got worse. 
This is when i had to take it to the Reparier to try to restore it, save all my files which he did save everything. Reformated the C drive and copied all the files back to the C having divided the drive into two. He saved copy of the Blocks in D drive and other files.
