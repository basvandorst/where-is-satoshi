Have you tried using this tool? I can help you run it.
I don't see what else can have gone wrong. It must be that you scanned the wrong QR or typed the password wrongly. Try doing it manually with the tool above.

Dude, its some stupid mistake for sure. There is no way the pdf changed (right?), so if it worked before it can't not work now. Try again tomorrow. Look for mistakes such as 1 (one) instead of l (L), o/0/O, etc, every letter, number and character. There are no chances of hardware or software failing with you having tried so many different scenarios. The mistake must be yours, it is likely extremely basic. Scan the correct QR, (try different orientations/turn you phone 90deg each time maybe?) type the password as you think it is and then try swapping easy to mistake characters such as the ones mentioned above. Ask a friend to oversee.

Try a different keyboard language, you may have used a different language before (I don't know if it makes a difference). Obviously check the integrity of the QR and code for faded ink or other marks.

I am currently learning about ecc and dont know that much yet, however, I will explain what I can. I'll only explain how the trapdoor function works. 
Dotting a point (A) with itself N number of times leads to a point B. N is the private key, an extremely large number, eg, 2^256. Even if A and B are public information, to find N will be extremely hard. This at first doesn't make sense since you can just dot A until you find B right? However, N is 2^256 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936! To brute force, you will have to dot A that many times until you find B, and thus N. This would take trillions of years on even a supercomputer. However, if you know N, the number of dotting operations you have to do to find B is much much smaller. This is the case as can use a method called exponentiation by squaring, which means that you split N into powers of 2. N is 2^256, thus, what you would do is:
A dot A is 2A
2A dot 2A is 4A
4A dot 4A is 8A
2^3 A dot 2^3 A is 2^4 A 
2^128 A dot 2^128 A is 2^256 A
Thus, in 256 dotting operations, we found A dotted 2^256 times, which is the point B.
I don't yet know the mathematics behind this but by searching elliptic curve cryptography pdfs you can find countless resources.
