Measuring the transaction volume by the size of it's backlog is a single variable analysis of a complex situation.  Hashrate is always increasing, and with it a reduction in the backlog size.  Segwit adoption and Exchange batching is increasing and with it a reduction in the backlog size.
I would contend that the drop in volume is the primary reason for the reduction in the backlog, but there are other factors.  Those factors matter.

Bingo, this is the one people are missing.  Volume is down a lot from it's peak. Exchanges batching, more segwit adoption, additional mining capacity all help too, but the heart of this is the drop in volume.

Coinbase works like that,  GDax doesn't.
GDAX has 0 fees if you make a limit order.  Coinbase has no limit order options and they take 1.49% on ACH transfers.
When picking between the two it's a risk.  Do you think the coin will go up 1.5% in the next 10 days?  Then use coinbase.  Honestly GDax slow transfer cause a lot of FOMO, but it also slows you down and makes you reconsider your buy which is healthy

Honestly this HODL mindset is a little scary. It's like a religion and it's going to end up putting some people out on the street.
Putting huge percentages of your life savings in crypto is dangerous.  For any coin.  There are 1500 coins and you don't know which ones will win.
Bitcoin was the first, it has the network effect.  It also has fundamental problems deep within it's design because it was the first and we were ignorant.  Tread carefully.

The wealth allocation is incredibly skewed because of the first come first served effect.  All these coins are pyramids where you have to pay off the first comers.  There are other ways to allocate coins.

Thiel's position is that most everything is shit, except bitcoin which serves as a hedge against tyrannical governments. Small allocations of it make sense in a larger portfolio.

Not true at all. We have become very efficient in terms of material use and CO2 output.
US CO2 output is at 25 year lows, GDP is at all time highs. CO2 output has been in decline for a decade while industry has been increasing the amount of goods produced.

I've read it several times, but nowhere do you use the word litecoin or LTC. You truly believe you've answered my question, which means only one thing.
You consider LTC a utility token. Is this correct?
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:31:13
I get it. I understand what atomic swaps are. Litecoin is not an IoT token or a utility token.
The question is, why would someone swap BTC for LTC in a world with lighting network?

I can see you're getting emotional. There is no need to be upset. It was a simple question that could be answered with a single sentence.
What is the use case of LTC in a world with lighting network (one where BTC has lower fees and faster confirmation times than LTC)?
Atomic swaps, okay. But for what reason would you swap into/out of LTC? What is the use case for the LTC that triggered the need to swap?

"Silver to bitcoin's gold" The problem with silver was that when paper currency came along and was exchangeable for small denominations of gold, then silver became useless.
What purpose does litecoin serve in a world with lighting network?

BTC has a testnet already. LTC isn't it.

To swap for BTC?
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:37:55
You quoted the question but you didn't answer it.
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:24:38
I think you are missing the point here. For what purpose would somebody swap into litecoin if BTC lighting network is offering insanely cheap transaction fees and instant confirmation. Isn't the entire value prop of litecoin that it is a faster and cheaper fee version of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:36:27
I have no animosity against litecoin. I only asked for a use case of LTC in a world with lighting network.
Right now people say it has lower fees, it's block time is faster compared to BTC. Those a valid critiques. But what happens when BTC is instant and nearly free?

BTC bro's keep in mind, the first Operating System was a success among hobbyists and a failure among the public.  The same can be said of the first MP3 player, the first airplane, the first social network etc.
Your post reminds me of a desktop Linux worshiper stating the superiority of the Linux, while Windows holds 80% of the market share.  Sure Linux has unique and important benefits but the truth is it is cumbersome to use.  It was only a matter of time until someone else figured out a way to make it easy to use.  That is where crypto is right now.
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:36:52
My point is when people claims something is revolution it isn't.  The revolutionary things are always the ones people never see coming.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:11:06
Bitcoin is only money to a small subset of people.  The second thing isn't best and I'm not claiming it is.  Only that the first thing is often poorly timed, misunderstood, and not easy to use outside the hobbyist sphere.  Historically the first emergent technology fails and is revived, improved, and tinkered with.  We don't have a good track record of getting things exactly right on the first attempt and BTC itself is proving resistant to change.  
When someone can demonstrate to the common man why they need crypto and make it easy to use then we'll be serious.  Right now I see 1000 coins trying to do the exact same thing, BTC odds of winning this are 1/1000 and the odds drop with each new coin that is released.
