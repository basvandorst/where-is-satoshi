coinbase.com (bank transfer, credit card) fees 
bit2me.com (sofort) fees 3%
Blockchain.info (credit card) fees 3%

If you want such small amount just drop me a message and I explain you how to do it.
Anyway, ther will be always a fee that you will have to pay for the service.

Try to contact the sender and ask him for a new transaction, a double spend is a double spend, nothing that you can do to complete this transaction.

Can you explain better whats the problem? You bought bitcoins from coinbase using a credit card or a bank transfer?
Give us some more info and maybe a blockchain.info link to this transaction?
If for example you send 100$ to someone and you dont fix a fee for miners then probably nobody will include it in a block, after 24 hours there will be a chargeback in the senders wallet.

bit2me.com is probably the easiest way to sell your bitcoins as you cash out fiat via traditional banks ATM, they connected more than 10.000 ATM's in Spain and all you need is a spanish phone number and be registered on their website. 
On other side if you want to buy bitcoins you can use localbitcoins or Bitcoin ATM and it charges 4% in fees on buy or sell.
Here is one of them:
I hope it helps.

Is a nice service yeah, it saves a lot of time, they charge like 3% and you can convert btc to euros in few minutes. Seems that there will be a new service to buy cryptos here in Spain called tikebit.com
We will be able to buy cryptos in retail stores and the fees as far i know will be very low, apparently they are trying to bring "Blockchain" close to the people, in this way everyone can test and feel the power of it. 
I investigated a bit to see if there are similar services in the world and there is a french company doing something similar but they charge like 16% in fees.
