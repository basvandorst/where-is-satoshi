I wish the CEO of Blockchain.info would not be referred as the CEO of Blockchain. I know the difference, but common public may get the wrong impression.

Does anyone know how sensitive Electrum is to this "replacing Bitcoin transaction addresses to redirect transfers"?
I have majority of my funds in Electrum. Now, if I want to transfer them, I'm too afraid to do it as malware might change the address. If I transfer only a small amount first to see if address is legit, then a keylogger might steal my password. 
Which one is a bigger risk?
(Yes, noob here asking. Mac user.)

Do you have any idea how scarce the blockspace will become? I mean it sounds like bitcoin becoming too expensive to use for the majority.

I, for one, actually do want some protection from my own stupidity.
I also hope, that bitcoin would be safely usable also for the really stupid people.

Hey, thanks a lot for your advice! I really appreciate it.

Exactly. 
I can see why this idea is kind of funny and clever, just like some "clever" mocking names I used give some poor bullied classmates as a schoolkid. Things done in a flow and to be regretted when it is time to think again.

I as well was pleased how you handled the situation. I am now coming back to BC (from Kraken), verification process is underway.
I assume (as with any bank) that my fiat is safe an insured in case of theft or whatever. But how about my btc? If my bitcoins at BC gets somehow lost, what is your refund policy and how much capital you have to cover the losses of customers?
