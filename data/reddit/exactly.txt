They should investigate. Other EU countries are tired of sending billions their way (other people's tax money) and never seeing it back. 
If you ever went to Greece you'd notice many houses 2nd floor/roofs 'unfinished'. They have some law that you have to pay a lot less taxes if your house isn't finished. You can blame the government for this, but it's also the mindset of these people trying to evade taxes. And I'm guessing the countries that paid Greece such insane amounts to 'help' them, are now pushing for 100k+ checkup.

Gold is timeless, but things I dislike about gold:
* Difficult to store, transfer and spend.
* Paper IOU's, not 100% is backed by real gold.
* Fake gold, it can be filled with tungsten etc.
* Synthesized gold, in the near future they can just 'make' gold.
Problems that bitcoin doesn't have.
If you decide to get some bitcoin, you should read up on how to safely secure it. Paper wallets, Armory etc.

If we'd like bitcoin to succeed for centuries. Having different competing clients seems necessary. It's too easy to influence one small group of people and 'take control'. Maybe it takes 1 year, 10 years or 50 years, eventually it will happen. Having different groups makes this more difficult, on top of that, there are other client options when one group is 'compromised'.

Not an expert, but I've read that Inverted Bloom Lookup Tables should 'compress' larger blocksizes. 
Right now they are too small to take advantage of IB LUT's.

And not a single webdesigner makes a quick mockup of something better? Common...shouldn't be that hard.

@ u/theymos
Both being a mod on r/bitcoin and running the bitcointalk.org forum isn't a good thing, wouldn't you agree? 
Put yourself in our shoes, seeing how one person has influence in both biggest btc online information websites.
Time for a healthy change and step down. This way the community and BTC can become stronger.
And you can focus on the forum update a little bit more ;).

This surprised me as well.

Dimon is probably fully aware of bitcoin and it's slumbering power.
His need for an 'attack' confirmed it.

LN and SW are the answer. Millions of TPS.

Vitalik shouldn't talk so much, he did a lot more damage with his speculative shitcoin. 
And most people who made money with it, will defend that shitcoin to death.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:26:32
You have no clue on how LN works.

The main reason was Gavin having a talk with the CIA.

That's it, we need 1000's of space asics, directly powered by sunlight. Good luck shutting those down. /s
Maybe some day...

Probably mentioned the fiat currencies as to not shock the people too much.

It's my understanding that if I'd setup a channel with a few other entities I'd easily could go over 1million tps, it's only when they are finally settled on the bitcoin blockchain the transactions is counted into a block. But I could have billions of nlock time changed transactions before that.   
I'm sure for worldwide usage and billions of entities this has to scale with bigger blocks. But the tech itself is capable. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 05:00:45
So basically, technical errors &gt; corrupt law enforcement.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:58:54
This. 
Just because we need to wait a few years/decades for the tech to cope with the worldwide transactions volume doesn't mean we need to cripple bitcoin with introducing all sorts of 'middlemen'.

Had it happen twice that I needed to resync the entire blockchain because somehow after a sync (of a few days/weeks) it told me I had downloaded faulty blocks. Not sure if it's related to this, but it does suck nonetheless.

What if he was Russian and went to the KGB?
What if he was Israeli and went to Mossad?
If bitcoin becomes big, nations(and the banks behind them) will lose some form of influence. So they'll do everyting in their power to prevent his.
Satoshi was wise to cut of ties with Gavin. Bitcoin belongs to the world, not one nation.

People would love to tolerate this. Politicians and banksters, not so much.

He probably published one or more things in his life, does his writing style match the bitcoin white paper?

'mostly' is the keyword here.

Inflationary. Premined. Proof of Stake. Centralized. And if I'm to believe some people, the scripting language it's build on is flawed on a basic level. 
Why would anyone support it...
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:09:11
If you can't keep track of you own balance it's not the exchange it's fault. I can't imagine being so careless about it.
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:55:00
How is this cryptsy's fault? You took a risk, and failed.

Bitcoin was mostly created out of ideology. 
Altcoins are mostly created out of greed. 
I rather invest in ideology than greed, call me crazy.
