Currently I have a little in my hardware wallet and more in my coinbase.  For the general audience, would you suggest going without KYC on like localbitcoins with a price premium or just paying taxes?

Which one is better out of the three?

Ok suppose you use Bisq or HodlHold, or LocalBitcoins or whatever.
How are you going to receive funds once you sell your bitcoin? Since once you do, IRS may know you received a large amount of money to your account.

Interesting point. But logically make sense.
Would you suggest the same for larger volumes?
If what you're saying is 100% right, then why do hardware wallets exist?

You’re probably getting a lot of DMs about trading. DO NOT trade with them. I’ve gotten scammed by redditors who’ve been here for years, had a lot of karma. And showed “proof” of having previous successful trades with high karma redditors.

Which is the best out of those to move from CB pro?
Is Binance US any good (live in the US)?

Have experience with Binance.us though? Want to jump ship there.

This is primarily why I'm asking the question u/acered24

Probably a scam, here's what they sent:
otcfinance.net - over the counter partners for exchange. For first trade they will sign an agreement with you, various banks from where you receive SWIFT payment, LOI agreement will be signed so the bank will not know that you are receiving money for crypto. Fees depending on the amount you trade, starting from 0.5% per trade.
I don't trust it, neither should you.
