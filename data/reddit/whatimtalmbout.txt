Got a notification about this on my phone, groggily looked at it and all I saw was "trending on WOW! $11,000!"
Slide up on the notification, furiously unlock my wallet to check it, quickly realize this is not a thread about Bitcoin day-jumping to 11k.

Yeah have read that many times, and have never put in more BTC than I could ever even afford to lose. I gave $50 as an example, ideally you would just have 2 wallets like a checking account and a savings account which is, what you're saying i'm assuming, and use the BTC in your "checking" wallet. 
But the point was that BTC, just in general, is fun to use at any level of money, and the guy saying you're "all in" at, any level of money, was totally right.

8 thousand dollars a month trading virtual coins is "nothing crazy"?!?
Spot me some BTC bro, nothing crazy though.

I agree with this, plus I just think any amount of bitcoin you may or may not have is still fun, regardless of the amount it's all still money, I guess it is better to be saving it, but theoretically and literally buying something for $50+(w/e) USD that you have purely because a cryptocurrency jumped in value in a day or a few days is still pretty fun too. 
But obviously some people are a lot more serious about it in general and some people, obviously, have a lot more money to invest, and believe in BTC.  
Edit: BTW I enjoy playing around with the btc game, but I totally hate "regular" gambling and never do it. I was surprised I found it as interesting and as fun to use and play with as I did.
