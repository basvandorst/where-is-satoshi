"The secret to change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new."
BitCoin isn't going around destroying banks by smashing windows or rioting. It is just being itself; a decentralized, trustless, unfuckwithable yet wavy, peer-to-peer electronic cash system.  Use it or don't.
BitCoin was created to give the power of securely controlling your own finances back to the people. It is resistant to many manipulation techniques (printing money leading to inflation, denying access to funds, banks closing and taking off with your money, unfair reversal of transfers, etc.) These tactics are used by banks and governments all over the world.
However, I feel as if Bitcoin Cash is trying to confuse future buyers into buying it instead of BTC.  Just the way the BCH community talks to the BTC community is enough for me to never even look at it's price, let alone buy any.  If someone has a valid point, they do better to base it in factual evidence, instead of attacking the opponent's character. Not to mention they're trying to rip off BitCoin's name.
It's almost as if the ones who print our money and write our laws see it as a threat to their greedy ways.  These opposers will try to divide and conquer it as much as they can, which explains all of the BTC FUD coming from BCH supporters.  If they truly believe in BCH, they would spend that energy helping to build, safeguard, and spread BCH, not harm BTC.
Just like so many peaceful visionaries before (including Ghandi, John Lennon, Martin Luther King, Tupac, John F Kennedy and maybe even Jesus), BitCoin is causing people to question the way things "have always been" and stands to benefit the average person, instead of a central authority.
But unlike the names mentioned above, you can't shoot or crucify BitCoin, or even Satoshi Nakamoto, because it is not a person.  It is a shared idea of how finances should be.  Fair for all.

I hodl so that one day when my stack is worth billions, I can build a "free factory" in the Saraha Desert.
An extremely tall mega-structure that uses 3D printing to produce all of humans' needs (vehicles, phones, toothbrushes, EVERYTHING!) out of plastic (which can be made using the Saraha's sand).
This structure will be powered by solar panels, and run by AI.  Minimal upkeep after the initial building.
All products will be freely given to people who need them around the world, shipped via their solar (or Tesla coil) powered car/boat/jet.
Oh, and cuz I SUCK at day trading and fuck banks. ������
