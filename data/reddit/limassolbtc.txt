Warrants are issued by the Court after the police presents a solid case for possible criminal conviction.
So yes, its the police to be praised.

Great idea. He answered a couple of questions in Limassol but there was not enough time. We also asked him some more in a private conversation after the event.

Andreas has a very valid point. Respect.

They have done evrything before they opened. And when they opened, they closed.

I confirm Dr. Vlachos's passion and inspirational presentation skills when talking about bitcoin. 
When he went on stage in Limassol the participants were literally thrilled by what he had to say!

Well said.
On March 18 Brewster released a Revised Prospectus and on the 19th said "we are illiquid"?
Why the prospectus was released, to sell more shares, no?
I wish you all the best guys.

Hi Andreas
In the University of Nicosia MOOC and MSc there is an online worldwide course and an on the ground in Cyprus.
Will you be teaching on both courses? We are a bunch of guys wondering whether to do the online or the on the ground course.
BTW you have a good reputation in Cyprus, actually very few know your association with Neo and Brewster. You are known for your UNIC position and your link with the University reinforces your good name. 
Looking forward to meeting you at the course.

Antonis said they will release news soon.
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:06:25
Can somebody forward this to the police?

This was theft man. Theft. 
Danny might have started honestly, but incompetence and continues lies to everybody, turned him into a crook.

Have you been drinking?

Good point.

I am definitely interested for the course too.
In the Limassol NEO event the CFO of the University said that some of the most well known and respected names in the Bitcoin community and Bitcoin academia will be on the course, either as professors, lecturers, guest speakers, interviewees e.t.c.
Any idea who these might be?

In a bitcoin we trust, not in acypriot banks.
