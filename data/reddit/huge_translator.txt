On the basis of?

I am contacting Ledger now. Thank you for your wisdom.
As for money, it doesn't concern me as much as catching these criminals
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:29:36
I really don't think it is the ledger. I don't want to put anyone up on the stake.
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:04:15
I don't think so since I don't type in my seed 
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:30:30
I used a script  on Ubuntu but it could not claim from a segwit address at the time

I have no idea what I did wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:45:57
How did you know I had a ledger nano? Are you the hacker?
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:51:08
It's called a throwaway. I don't need your validation, you might be the criminal yourself trying to invalidate my statement?
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:47:46
I did
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:42:50
I thought so too but I don't download much on my laptop. On microsoft office and chrome
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:29:23
