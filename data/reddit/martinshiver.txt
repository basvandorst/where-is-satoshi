I'm not sure what you mean by "secure" the exchange. 
You have to realize the fundamental issue is that if you keep your crypto on the exchange, you do not actually own it.  Exchanges do not give you access to the private keys or seed words.  They basically own and fully control your account, so if they ever go out of business or they get shut down or just decide to take your crypto, they can pretty much do so.  Get your crypto off the exchange...
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:01:09
Well, the only fork that is worth anything at this point that you can potentially get access to is Bitcoin Gold, which is currently worth around $230 per Bitcoin Gold. To cash it out you will have to find a wallet that supports this coin, retrieve it using your seed keys, transfer it to an exchange that supports Bitcoin Gold and sell/trade.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:44:25
The seed words can be displayed on the Ledger's screen.. no?
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:04:51
Dude, no one knows this.. its all pure speculation.

Well, capital gains is capital gains. In terms of "minimizing" the impacts to your bottom line, I suppose you can try writing off Bitcoin purchase expenses, like your internet connection bill, etc.. but I don't think that would fly if they audit you. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:21:28
Unless you can recover the private keys or seed words that were generated when the address was created, there is no way to recover access to your Bitcoin. Even if you find out what email address it was, typically that information is not sent/stored in an email (unless you decided to save/send your private keys or seed words via email, which would be a bad idea in the first place). Lets remember, Bitcoin is not actually stored locally on in a "wallet". The wallet software just creates and gives you access to the blockchain, it doesn't store anything.

Ivan on Tech did a good video describing this (I don't have the link ATM). One thing is that Hashgraph is patented and it is a company building this.  Blockchain is an open-source technology available to all. Apples and Oranges...
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:09:15
Most exchanges add on a market buy fee on top of a limit order. The global average price reflects something closer to the limit order. So yes, it actually is the reason.  Again, making money.

This is the original Bitcoin sub. I'm not sure what you mean by Blockstream fork.. are you referring to activating Segwit on the Bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:50:45
Well its the most popular exchange and they have 2 factor authentication. It is pretty secure for what it is.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:16:22
Yes. But, with new tech on the way, you won't have to.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:52:53
That may be so, but it is not a continuous block size increase to who knows how big..  block size increases are just simply not a long term solution.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:06:01
Bitcoin went viral, then people chilled out...
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:33:26
Yes, but to the layperson, they see the fork as creating two (or more) NEW things and the original ceases to exist. Just as the OP of this thread thought that there used to be Bitcoin and now there is Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Legacy.

The mining algorithm does not need improvement. The whole point of Proof of Work mining is for it to be difficult. Bitcoin mining difficulty is adjusted approximately every 2 weeks.  If there are too many miners, the difficulty goes up..
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:03:42
Huh? When did I ever say that I know "a lot about crypto". 99.9% of people that buy into Bitcoin have no clue how it works, what it is used for or why it was created.. maybe I should have stated "welcome to the world of crypto markets", where everything is completely unpredictable.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:36:33
This comes up all the time... The answer is: no one knows where this is going.

There are many other advantages: it is decentralized, border-less, it can be instantly sent without trusting the other party, it does not exclude most of the world from using it (i.e. you essentially need permission to use US dollars (i do not mean pure cash) by banks/governments). In the future crypto will not be just a "niche", it will be the means of storing and exchanging value at a global scale.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:46:35
If you store BTC on coinbase (or any other exchange for that matter), you don't actually own it, and your BTC is under control of the exchange.

Improvements like Segwit and technology like the Lightning Network will minimize on-chain transactions which should keep the relative electricity mining costs to about what they are right now. Future mining will be dependent on "alternative" energy sources more then ever.. even create their own electrical infrastructure. Can't continue with coal.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:41:10
I would say no one has a definitive answer weather to buy Bitcoin or another altcoin.  It's a bit like asking "should I buy US Dollars, or just invest in Canadian Dollars.."  If you did your research into what Bitcoin means and its implications on the world, and you believe in this technology, go all in on Bitcoin and hodl. If you think another currency is better or is going to rule the world, buy that one.. Since this is a Bitcoin sub/forum, you will get Bitcoin answers. Alts have their own subs/forums.
In terms of which wallet to use, for a $100 worth of Bitcoin, I would just keep that on the exchange and save yourself the transfer fees (unless you plan on using gdax or gemini which allow free transfer outs). If you plan on purchasing a large amount, invest in a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger Nano S are the popular ones at the moment).  For iOS, I think Breadwallet is the popular software wallet these days.  In the end, the wallet only gives you access to the blockchain, it does not locally store Bitcoin or anything like that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:11:32
By the virtue of mining ("solving the equations") the miners are verifying the transactions.  They get rewarded in two ways: mining fees and first to mine a block reward (currently I believe it is 12.5 Bitcoin reward per block mined). All other users do not verify transactions..
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:16:41
Ethereum does not use the term "block size" in the same way Bitcoin does.  Another redditor explained this here:

@_date: 2018-01-08 14:44:12
Are you looking to cash out or trade your BTC for something else? If no, then there is no reason to move BTC to an exchange.  
I'm not sure what you mean by saying you "cannot seem to connect to the network to send a transaction".  Is your device connected to the internet? Do you see a BTC balance when you open the wallet software?  If yes, there should be no reason you can't send to another address.
To obtain BCH, you will need to install a wallet that supports BCH and input your private keys/seed words from your regular BTC wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:59:26
This. You keep increasing the block size and that leads to centralization which is literally what Bitcoin was designed to avoid..
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:33:37

The only thing that may change for you is where you buy your Bitcoin. Other than the UK government outright banning Bitcoin and making owning it a crime, nothing else changes. Bitcoin is decentralized and border-less.

You described it yourself, new money keeps on coming in.. supply/demand takes care of the rest. For example, the more demand there is for Bitcoin, the higher the price per Bitcoin rises and the market cap rises along with it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:01:47
Sorry, but its actually the opposite of what you said.  Anyone can move into a newly created currency by forking the original blockchain. I can do this right now and create MyBitcoin3.0 and I don't need consensus.  The block size only changes if the majority reach consensus to change the block size.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:49:11
It is done based on consensus of developers. If the majority support changing the block size, the block size changes.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:18:07
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:21:12
I think the issue is more related to consistency. There are people that get their withdraws fast and others have to wait days and sometimes weeks.. There clearly is a problem.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:19:11
Segwit is already active on the Bitcoin blockchain. Segwit is not a block size increase. Segwit reduces the amount of data per transaction there by making more transactions fit in a block.  We are opposed to block size increases because it is a short term solution to a long term problem. The block size would have to be increased continually and eventually the only people who can run a node are large corporations and bam!, centralization.  There are wiser ways of solving this problem, namley Layer 2 solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:56:42
I can't comment on what the "fair" price is. The price is what people are willing to buy/sell for on each exchange. Coinbase is not very reasonable in terms of tacking on their fees for buying and selling though. Since they are the most popular and newbie friendly, they can charge higher prices.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:38:07
Is Coinbase not available in Iowa? They allow credit card purchases (with high fees though).
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:32:15
Same as buying a car, and giving it to someone. That someone has to pay the transfer/registration tax (if they want to register the car). At this point, I would't worry about it. But in the future, the government may be asking where that someone got the funds to buy a bunch of stuff (if that is what they decide to do) and may audit them..

Bank transfers from your bank account to an exchange account take a number of days to clear. Signing up to an exchange these days takes a while (sometimes days) to verify your account.  There are alternatives, such as localbitcoins.com where you deal directly with individuals selling Bitcoin, but they typically do not take bank transfers or credit card transfers.

As far as I know, if you send from a segwit address to a non-segwit address, you do not get the benefits. I'm looking at the current confirmation times and average fees, and it looks like currently 10 minutes is the average time to get a confirmation and depending on the amount you sent, $10 seems like a regular average fee at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:23:45
Gemini is segwit ready..  The issue is not just with wallet devs and exchanges, it is also with the millions of people who bought Bitcoin to "get rich quick" without even knowing what they bought.. There are plenty of wallets out there that are segwit ready. Regular people just need to start using them.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:30:41
These block increases would be exponential and would outpace bandwidth and storage increases over time.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:18:59
Yes, I agree with what you posted just now. Perhaps I mis-read what you wrote. If the block size is to be increased, it does indeed require a fork, and if consensus is reached, a "new" chain is created and the old one is no longer used/mined (since consensus was achieved) there-by making the "new" one the continuation of the old one with new rules (i.e. block size)
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:49:07
Well, as far as I know, "market cap" is price times circulating supply.  If you are looking at coinmarketcap.com, on the top left they show cryptocurrencies and markets.  It is possible that at the time you are looking at those numbers, a new marked was added to this website or a new alt shot up in value.  There are over a 1000 alts.. I know that the price seems to decline on the main page, but not for all alts.  Another thing is that the circulating supply increases as well, but at a more regular pace.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:18:07
I don't know how Coinbase organizes their "wallet" address allocation to users. Maybe they have one address where they keep 10000 users' BTC and the coins are attached to usernames.. or maybe they do generate a new address per user.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:18:26
If you want to buy other alts, you will have to transfer the balance that you want to an exchange that allows you to buy other alts.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:03:13
Well, the bigger the block size, the more bandwidth and storage is required for all that are running nodes. Eventually that may lead to only large corporations being able to run a node, hence centralization.  In terms of Ethereum, they have issues with this as well, so this is why their long term plan is to switch to a Proof of Stake algorithm instead of Proof of Work.

I really wish the everyone would move away from the "fork" terminology. Its misleading in my opinion. A fork implies that two NEW things were created out of the original and the original ceases to exist. We should be calling it a "split" or something. That implies that Bcash and its ilk "split" off from the original, and the original continues.

ETH was not designed to be used as a traditional "currency". The token is designed to be a means of exchange between smart contracts. Right now, it doesn't even do that. It is basically a vehicle for money raising for the Ethereum project. There are no retailers accepting ETH as a form of payment and there probably never will be.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:06:04
Of course it "could be". I'm strictly talking about current state and what each token is currently used for. Who knows what the future will be like. I'm thinking because Bitcoin was first, has the biggest brand and the strongest development support, it will be the one to continually dominate.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:32:09
The exchange acts as a big wallet with their own address(s). The issue is that you as a user do not have access to the private keys or seed words of the exchange wallet, the exchange does. So users are trusting the exchange with their coins.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:03:23
Bitcoin may be very well be surpassed by a new more capable token. But. It currently has the biggest (by far) brand, and the strongest development support.  All other alts (including Bitcoin forks, i.e. Bcash) have at most a few people actually contributing to the project. As Andreas A. said, currency gets it's value from use, and currently Bitcoin is the most used token.

Think about the internet and HTTP. The creator(s) did not envision (or write down in their "whitepaper) how the Internet is today.. they did not envision the multimedia layers, communication layers, social layers, and even crypto layers.

@_date: 2017-12-14 01:11:47
yes, there has been lots of infighting on how to scale Bitcoin because you require consensus on major changes to the network. But, the fees in the past were quite low compared to what they are these days.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:42:27
Altcoin price is not directly linked to Bitcoin. So if you want to buy altcoins for $150 you are gambling on the fact that said altcoin will jump up in its own market price for a given time period higher (in terms of percentage) then Bitcoin jumps up in that same time period. If nothing changes, then you still have your $150 worth of altcoin which is relative in price to Bitcoin.. Think of it like buying Bitcoin using US dollars or Australian dollars. The Bitcoin market price is still the same, but the buying power of your currency is different.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:39:37
Yes, most people new to this space will invest small amounts only.  Remember, only invest what you are willing to lose.

No one knows except for the market manipulators at Coinbase/GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:45:50
You have the correct train of thought. What you are describing is essentially how most Bitcoin exchanges work at its basics.  It is pretty much the same as stocks.  If all of a sudden everyone wants to sell their stock, and there are no buyers, the price goes down until there are buyers at that price and vice versa. In terms of allocation, I think different exchanges allocate BTC in different ways, but I'm just speculating here.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:05:53
Anyone can fork Bitcoin and create their own coin.  I can create my B3X coin if I want.. doesn't mean it will be worth anything.

Well, unless you have the private key recorded somewhere, or the seed words recorded to restore your access to this address (via a wallet), there is not much you can do.

As long as you hold a BTC balance before the fork, you can gain access to any fork balances at any time after the fork.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:45:28
A wallet only gives you access to the block chain. It doesn't actually store any digital tokens/coins locally. If you did not write down/back up your seed words that are generated by the wallet, and you destroy said wallet, you won't be able to restore access to the block chain (unless you memorize your seed words)
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:35:27
Why did you buy into cryptos if you didn't think the future is "bright" and didn't believe in the technology?
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:00:49
This "fork" does not affect Bitcoin. It is just copying Bitcoin to create another altcoin.  It is supposed to happen today, but I'm not sure exactly when.  I doubt many exchanges will actually support this fork though.. not enough consensus or support from the community.  Take a look at Bitcoin Gold, it basically died as soon as it forked out.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:02:06
Well, anything is better then this "price is dropping" FUD..
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:20:20
As long as you have access to the private keys/seed words generated by any wallet, it doesn't matter which wallet you use.  Once the private key/seed words are generated, they will work on any wallet (there are exceptions), so that means that you can use 10 different wallets and have the same balance displayed in those 10 different wallets as long as you use the seed words to restore access for that wallet to the blockchain. You have to remember, the wallet doesn't actually hold any balance of tokens locally, all it does is it gives you access to browse the blockchain. Of course you can use 10 wallets and have them generate NEW private keys and then you will have 10 different addresses that you can transfer BTC/tokens around.  With regards to Jaxx, if the B2X token becomes popular, Jaxx will eventually add support for it. If it is a shitcoin, they probably won't bother.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:48:03
There is a chance. Are you looking for a percentage? I would say 0.1 to 1 percent of all smart phones are infected with such malware. Will all of them have crypto stolen? Most likely not. So, depending on how much bitcoin you hold, you have a 0.00001% to 0.1% chance of getting your crypto stolen.  *These numbers are purely pulled out of my ass...
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:39:08
Each wallet has backup words/phrases that you need to write down and store in a secure place. These "seed" words are how you can restore your access to your coins in the case that you lose/trash your haddrive or lose your hardware wallet (such as Trezor or Nano S). The people who have "lost" their bitcoin because the harddrive is gone simply did not write and secured their backup seed words which are used to restore access to their Bitcoin using another wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:35:43
This is ok. Bitcoin is a "crypto".
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:38:55
I don't see how that is possible. I think this is just some FUD/lies to incentivize people to buy into B2X which may cause it to raise in value.

You must not come around here often... There are threads everyday about fixing the problem. They have been stickied many times.  There is constant conversation on this sub about scaling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:27:48
Just sayin, you can always check on Github to see how the development is going and what the activity is for both Litecoin and Bitcoin.. it is all open source. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:05:18
The people that pump into BTC right now are mostly people who have no idea what Bitcoin is, they just see stuff on the media and jump on the bandwagon. No one in the Bitcoin community expected for things to literally explode like this and bog everything down.  The solutions that are being currently worked on are a long haul type of solutions that do not happen overnight. Looks like Bitcoin will be volatile for some time but the overall value of crypto will keep going up in the long run. No one knows at this point if Bitcoin will be the one that wins the world, but right now it has the strongest development support and the strongest brand. Once scaling technologies are fully adopted, more merchants will adopt crypto as a payment form and we will have a real revolution on our hands. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:38:46
There are better options though.. Coinbase is just n00b friendly (at least it was...)
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:37:36
The 12 words are the seed words that lets you restore your private key so you can have access to your Bitcoin (via any wallet, doesn't have to be breadwallet). Once you have your private key, you can use any app (including a "paper wallet") to gain access to your Bitcoin.  You are right, if someone accesses your phone and gets a hold of the seed words, they can use those words to "restore" your access to your Bitcoin and steal your Bitcoin by sending that Bitcoin to another private key they control. Most software wallets allow you to setup a PIN so that people need to also know that if they are to access your private key or seed words. You can also use a hardware wallet. Its essentially a USB device with a small screen which lets you display your seed words and your balance, etc.. It is used for "offline" storage so it is safer then a device that is constantly connected to the internet. You can delete the app, and reinstall it and restore your access via the seed words, but the seed words need to be stored in a secure place so that you don't lose your seed words, and that no one else can use them on your behalf. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:44:46
A more correct way to say this is that crypto is actually YOURS when you use a wallet that gives you access to the private keys (like Mycelium).  Coinbase does not give you access to your private keys and so they have full control of "your" crypto.  Always get your coins off the exchange unless you are willing to lose it..
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:14:34
You will need to get your private keys/seed words to actually claim your forked tokens/coins. Since the exchange doesn't give you access to those, you will need to move your BTC to a wallet that allows access to the private keys/seed words and then you will need to use the seed words on a wallet that supports the forked coin/token to "redeem" said tokens. I may have been wrong in my previous reply.. Basically if you keep the coins on the exchange, you will not be able to "redeem" the forked coins unless the exchange starts supporting the coin. So, I would just move the tokens off the exchange to ensure you have access to your private keys/seed words.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:02:33
Essentially yes.  There are other types of exchanges such as localbitcoins.com which is more of a peer-to-peer style exchange where you directly deal with the person who is selling/buying. That is more of a place that brings people together.  I believe most exchanges such as Coinbase maintain and manage liquidity as well as hold a reserve of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-15 15:19:03
Well, from a wallet perspective, currently Mycelium does not support segwit, which is a huge shame on them and it keeps your fees high when sending from a Mycelium wallet.  In terms of the exchange, Coinbase has pretty much the highest buy/sell fees out of anyone, so..  One big current issue is moving Bitcoin from address to address are the mining fees which are crazy high these days.  There is not much you can do that about those fees right now..
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:23:03
Its more of a race who can validate the block first. The race is what keeps things valid.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:07:16
Careful with the transfer fees tho. Everytime you move BTC from wallet address to wallet address you are paying mining fees and lately they are very high.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:20:17
Pure speculation. You can try if you want.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:26:12
Are you refering to the small amounts that coinbase uses to check if the bank account/credit card is yours and legit? If yes, you need to check your bank's pending transactions (on the bank's online banking site) and enter those amounts you see into the coinbase verification. If that doesn't match, I don't know what else to say.. they must match.

It all depends on how you feel about your investment and what your personal security policy is. Lets say you invest a $100 dollars one week and then another $100 another week, that couple of hundred dollars may not be much to you, so you can opt to leave it on the exchange.  Every time you move crypto off the exchange, that is counted as a transaction to another address, and there are currently fairly high fees (and long confirmation wait times) associated. What I would do is amass a decent amount of Bitcoin/crypto and then move it to a wallet for security and more important for "ownership" (look into the previous example that I mentioned in the above reply). If you want to sell and you have a bunch of crypto in your wallet, you will then have to move it back onto the exchange.  Think of the exchange as an intermediary that you have to have funds deposited in so that you can exchange it for something else (in this example back to a Fiat currency). Exchanges are definitely inconvenient, just like on the stock market, if you want to buy stocks you go through the stock exchange and you "deposit/transfer" your own money through the stock exchange to acquire stock (of course that process is largely invisible to a typical buyer, but it still happens).
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:07:19
You keep saying that you "sent" Bcash from your regular wallet to the Electrum Cash wallet.  If you did that, do you still have regular Bitcoin in your balance? You cannot send regular Bitcoin to a Bcash address, that transaction would be rejected.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:59:00
All of them should. Remember, crypto is not actually physically stored/downloaded on the wallet. The wallet only provides access to the blockchain. The crypto is stored on the blockchain network.  Lets say you setup a new Bitcoin wallet using Jaxx, you can write down the recovery/backup words and then import them into a Mycelium wallet. Using those words, the Mycelium wallet creates access using the same private key that you had on the Jaxx wallet. So you can use Jaxx AND Mycelium at the same time and both will display your current amount of Bitcoin since it is the same key.

If coinbase adds an alt, it will pump the over all price because coinbase is the biggest exchange with the most users, so all those n00b users will start buying into to the alt to "get rich quick" and drive up the price. It doesn't matter if you have your tokens on coinbase or another exchange, the price of tokens exists outside of exchanges.

That's correct, constantly increasing the block size is not a long term solution.

At this point, crypto-currency is still very highly speculative. If you are a new buyer, definitely do not put all your eggs in the crypto basket. Best volatile investment mantra is to only invest what you can afford to loose.  In terms of educating yourself and others, this takes time to change knowledge and more importantly behaviors. I would start watching and exploring Andreas Antonopoulos' videos on Youtube (  ). He has amazingly lucid explanations into the world of crypto and blockchain technologies.

Buy Bitcoin and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:08:37
Yes, there is a fee for every type of transaction. If you use Coinbase to buy, you will pay the Coinbase transaction fee, then, you will want to move your purchase off Coinbase into a wallet. At this point you will be charged a mining fee for this "transaction". So, to buy, you will be effectively charged 2 fees. You can use other exchanges such as Gemini or GDAX which charge much lower buy/transaction fees (in fact, GDAX does not charge a fee if you buy in a certain way), but once you move the purchase off the exchange, you will still be charged a mining fee (which goes to the miners and not to the exchange).

I believe taxes are owed on capital gains in fiat currency, so I believe it is only when you withdraw dollars from the exchange. I could be wrong though.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:04:33
There is no way to avoid mining fees at this point when sending from a wallet. You may be able to pick the lowest fee via your wallet, but your transaction may be in limbo and waiting to be picked up by miners who knows when (because miners pretty much only pick up the higher specified fee transactions at the moment)

Well, this is a Bitcoin sub, so the discussion here is mainly about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has the strongest developer support (in terms of upgrading and implementing new technology to Bitcoin) as well as the strongest brand. This makes it relatively expensive. For now, I would just buy Bitcoin (even if it is only $150 worth). Other tokens are promising, but its all pure speculation at this point.

Don't panic. Just hodl.  If your transaction is not confirmed you cannot re-send/send back that same transaction.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:54:19
The advice is excellent for anyone that wants to hodl and believes in the future of this technology. Basically, if you keep your Bitcoin on the exchange you don't actually own it or control it. Exchanges do not give you access to your private keys or seed words. You trust the exchange with all of your funds.. think about that.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:37:44
Yes. 
In terms of performance of ALTs, currently its all pure speculation.  A lot of ALTs have tiny development teams who hardly do much from week to week to improve their technology. Anyone buying ALTs (excluding Etherium and possibly Litecoin) is just gambling on the price going up. Think of the price movement on ALTs like this: I buy a bunch of ALT, someone sees this and buys even more of said ALT, all of a sudden others start noticing and thinking to themselves that price is about to sky rocket and start jumping on the bandwagon and driving the price up.  Then, I sell my bunch of ALTs and people noticed that, so the mass hysteria begins again and people start selling and tanking the price..  Its all crowd mentality, speculation, gambling with a pinch of manipulation thrown in.

Yes, you don't own your Bitcoin if you keep it on Coinbase. Coinbase does not allow you access to your private keys. This is basically the equivalent of giving a bunch of money to a stranger for them to hold and you hope they give it back to you once you ask for it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:16:02
I'm not exactly sure what the current fees are, but because Bitcoin is soo popular these days, this has caused major network congestion issues and a big increase in transaction fees.  I believe the fees are are based on the percentage that you buy. I think the current mining fees are in the neighbourhood of 7 to 8%, so if you are buying $100 expect to pay 7 or $8 in fees...  Everyone is waiting for Bitcoin scaling solutions which would drop the fees to almost nothing and create avenues for mass adoption which would cause people to actually buy and sell stuff using Bitcoin instead of fiat money. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:42:01
the mining fee is typically part of the transaction and you don't get to choose 0 fee. Some wallets allow you to choose slow/normal/fast which change the mining fees according to which one you pick.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:04:06
If you plan on buying a substancial amount of crypto, always move it to a wallet.  The main reason for this is that if you keep crypto/Bitcoin on the exchange, you don't actually own it because the exchange does not give you access to your private keys.  An easy way of understanding this is giving cash to a stranger to hold for you. If you give your cash to someone, you no longer own that cash and you have to trust them to give you the cash back if you request it back. Same holds for Bitcoin, if you keep Bitcoin on the exchange, you don't have control of it and you don't actually own it.  With regards to transfer fees, currently there are high fees for moving Bitcoin around from address to address. As far as I can tell the fee is currently in the neighborhood of 6 to 8% per transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:47:49
You'd have to reach out to GDAX for help..
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:43:47
Again, no. Just because BTC is going up, ALTs are not going down, or up.  Also, most exchanges that deal with ALTs trade ALTs directly for fiat currency. They are not linked to BTC.

I said "basically" non-issue. Fees have always been there, but not nearly this high.

on localbitcoins.com some Bitcoin sellers take credit card transactions (but those sellers are rare).  I'm not sure what you mean by "getting a wallet and filling it with dollars and then send Bitcoin". What you are describing is essentially an exchange.  You have to first purchase/obtain the Bitcoin from somewhere so you can send it...
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:52:46
This is what Coinbase and GDAX force everyone to do. If you want to use their service, you have to do that. As to if it is safe.. you have decide.  My own opinion: nothing is ever perfectly safe...

I didn't even know it was a thing.  But apparently they are out there. Here are some more discussions: 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:50:47
Miners pick the "most expensive" route transactions from the mempool first. It doesn't work on a first come first serve basis. The more money you committed to giving the miners (via your wallet options) to do the mining, the faster your transactions will confirm.  I suppose you can become a miner and possibly pick only your transactions, but you will never be able to mine a block first since there are so many more "powerful" miners out there who have invested tons into the gear and electricity, so you will get beat every time and it will just be a big waste of money on your gear.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:29:32
Lightning Network is one of the solutions, yes. But it doesn't stop there.  If you think of the Internet as a whole, the development of the Internet did not stop at the web browser. Its a constant evolution.

@_date: 2017-12-13 16:21:49
If you are buying via the major exchanges (Coinbase, GDAX, Gemini), and you are only buying small amounts, I will say just keep the Bitcoin directly on the exchange (I don't recommend this for larger amounts). The reason is that the transfers between exchange and your wallet are going to be high. The "safety" trade-off is just not worth the fees with small amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:04:47
Fair enough. But, LN without segwit is almost unusable in the real world (but technically possible).
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:01:07

You have to understand, most people who bought into Bitcoin during this latest hype have no idea what they are buying, they don't care about the technology or scaling debates or debates in terms of altcoins. They are just jumping on the "get rich quick" bandwagon. The greedy influences with lots of BTC who are more interested in making money than helping crypto be mass adopted, are just manipulating the market and spooking the n00bs which leads to mass sell-offs and mass buys. The technology is moving at a much slower pace then the hype train, hence all these price changes.

The original project was to get enough consensus and not only "fork" the Bitcoin blockchain, but to "upgrade" it. The fork in that case would be that the main Bitcoin blockchain would be BTC and the few people that didn't want to do this would be some sort of Bitcoin Classic. From there, it turns out that most exchanges wanted to call this "upgrade" B2X and keep the Bitcoin Classic as BTC. That's where everything fell apart..
In this case, I believe that B2X is just a small fork by a couple of people, but they don't have consensus from node runners and miners to "upgrade" the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.  So in other words, just another shitcoin being born without much support.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:17:40
This latest B2X fork is not a "soft fork" and it is not supported by the real Bitcoin community..  but with that said, anyone can fork Bitcoin and hope for support..

Well, if you are using Coinbase and a separate wallet, you will pay the miner fee to transfer Bitcoin from your wallet to Coinbase (I believe it is currently in the neighborhood of 7% to 8%), then you may pay a Coinbase transaction fee for selling (I don't know how much that is at this point)
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:16:14
If you have already purchased the coins via Coinbase, then when you move the coins to Trezor you will be paying mining fees, those are not based on the exchange's fees, so it won't matter if you send it using Coinbase or GDAX.

Bitcoin intrinsic value is Trust. Its the same as we trust in the US Government that the US Dollar is worth as much as it is.  
In the Internet dotcom bubble example, I see Bitcoin as the Internet of money platform and something like the Lightning Network as the Google.  Since Lightning Network is a Layer 2 solution, it only uses Bitcoin as a token platform (it doesn't "upgrade" Bitcoin). Kind of like Google uses the Internet to do its thing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:23:36
Initially the value started rising because more and more people saw and started to understand the philosophy of crypto/Bitcoin and what it means for the future.  The value skyrocketed because of word of mouth followed up with mainstream media exposure. There is a limited amount of Bitcoin to own and when people start buying, the supply decreases, the price per unit goes up.  One problem is that most Bitcoin owners are completely clueless as to what they own and what it signifies. They are just jumping on the "get rich quick" bandwagon hoping to cash out.
I personally believe that this just the very beginning and the overall value of crypto is going to go much much higher then what it is today.  It is a paradigm shift of how we do business and how the world will work in the future. There is much literature on this so I suggest you do some exploring and reading. Mind you I said crypto, I didn't specifically say Bitcoin will win. Bitcoin currently has the strongest development base and the strongest brand. This is why it is currently on top. That doesn't mean that it will continue to be on top though. This technology is growing and evolving so fast that no one really knows how this will all end up. It is just faith and speculation for now... 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:50:12
As long as you keep the tokens in a wallet that allows you access to your private keys/seed words, then you can access any tokens that are created by a fork.  Since exchanges don't typically give you access to your private keys/seed words, you won't be benefiting from forks unless the exchange starts supporting that fork.

Those are just workings of market forces, not a direct link to BTC. People make money by buying small ALTs, pumping up the ALT price and then dumping said ALTs to buy BTC, then do it again and again. The market is still really small and there are mostly a handful (compared to say something like a NYC stock exchange) of influential buyers/sellers. But, imagine all of a sudden EVERYONE and their mom buys some small ALT because they have invented some revolutionary technology (or whatever), BTC can still be the same price (because it wasn't necessarily dumped) and said ALT will jump up in price (due to demand) by orders of magnitude. Now you have BTC and the ALT soaring in value as more overall money is being pumped into the crypto market.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:31:02
Depends on the amount you purchased. Its always a good idea to move your purchase off the exchange because you don't actually own your Bitcoin if you leave it on the exchange. The exchange does not give you access to private keys or seed words. This means that if the exchange gets hacked, gets shut down by the government or it goes out of business, you will lose your Bitcoin. Transaction fees and wait times are high currently, so if it is a small amount, most people keep it on the exchange (for now).
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:40:38
Bitcoin has never seen this kind of demand and these kinds of volumes.. Just a couple of months ago, the fees were a couple of dollars (and even that was super high). There are scaling solutions in the works, but those will take time for everyone to adopt. On small test scales, some of the solutions such as the Lighting Network are ready, but everyone (node operators, miners, wallet developers, etc) has to adopt this solution.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:41:40
In this case, I'm not sure what happened.  It may be possible that because you acquired your first Bitcoin so close to the Bcash fork, that it was just too late..

At this point I don't see EOS as the ETH killer. There have been some very contradictory and shady stuff going on with EOS. One major example is that they wanted to do their ICO on Ethereum and not on their own platform. If you look at their Github, the development is painfully slow with basically just a couple of people contributing. That is not a good sign of strong support...

Your wallet will show you how much BTC you bought and when (but not how much you bought it for in terms of fiat currency, that you will have to check/convert on your own). This information is public (in terms of your public address) and is recorded on the blockchain.  In terms of how the tax implications and audit works, this is going to be interesting...

Pretty much, except if there is a large green wall say at $10000, that means that there are many orders waiting for the price to drop to $10000 and only then they will buy.  So in a way, a large green wall is just a bunch of people waiting for the price to drop so they will buy.

In the simplest and quickest of terms, Bitcoin Cash solution to scaling (ensuring everyone's transactions are very cheap and quick) is to increase the block size. In my opinion this is a shortsighted and short-term fix and it also leads to centralization (which is very bad because you hand over control to a few central corporations/banks that run nodes and confirm transactions). If you keep increasing the block size, regular people will not be able to afford to run nodes due to the sheer size of the block and the amount of bandwidth required. Segwit is a fundamental layer solution where not all transactions (tiny ones, like buying coffee, etc) end up on the main block chain. Segwit opens doors to future scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network which makes small transfers even more viable in terms of price per transaction and time to confirm the transaction. Segwit and future scaling solutions are long term solutions and keep Bitcoin decentralized and open to everyone.  This is just my quick laymen explanation glossing over the hurdles of implementation and other details..

LN will be largely transparent to the end user once implemented across the board. Wallets will handle everything without you actually seeing what happens. So unless you are interested from a technical standpoint of view, most people will be totally uninterested (like your friend about segwit) how the underlying technology works.

You will still have to pay the mining fee. This does not go to the exchange, it is a fee that goes to miners who confirm the transaction. When people saying "you can save on fees" via GDAX, thats only for the exchange purchase fees, not blockchain transfer fees.

I agree. I also hope BTC solidifies a market lead. And I also think that Amazon will develop their own token. For now, I'm comparing this to what is happening on the small screen show development. Companies like Netflix and Amazon creating their own shows with the hopes of drawing us viewers in to their subscriptions. I think crypto may play out in such a way where we "subscribe" to our "favorite" retailers and use their tokens with some sort of backend/background exchange algorithm..  Its a crazy future.

I wasn't the original poster of this thread, so I do not maintain that ALT coins are a bubble, but I do maintain that MOST will fail as they are pure scams and vehicles for quick rich schemes (not all of course). 
Ether is a "currency" between smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. This is a different statement than saying Bitcoin is going to be a "world" currency used by all individuals to exchange value and store value.  You currently cannot go to Dell or Microsoft (like you can with Bitcoin) and pay with Ether, and further to that I don't see any retailer adopting Ether as a means of value exchange because that is not it's main use case.
As a store of value, as in my original reply to the original poster, it is currently the best because it has the strongest development pool (who are specifically developing Bitcoin as a store of value and as a means of exchange of value) and the strongest brand (never underestimate a strong brand).
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:38:05
Segwit is already active and would bring short term transaction fees way way down. The issue is that most exchanges and wallets have not adopted/upgraded yet... It is up to us as the community to push for adoption. Switch to an exchange that supports Segwit (Gemini for example) and switch to a wallet that supports segwit too (Electrum for example).
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:24:35
Depends on which OS/device you are using and which token/coin you plan on having. For Bitcoin on Android, I recommend Electrum because they support Segwit for BTC. For ETH, I don't have a recommendation.

If you are reffering to the public and private keys, The public key is used to receive Bitcoin. If someone is sending you bitcoin, they will be sending it using your public key as the receiving address and you have to show them the public key.  The private key is used when you wish to send Bitcoin to someone. Think of it like your digital "signature" authorizing the sending of Bitcoin. The private key must for obvious reasons be kept private and to yourself because if someone else knows/has access to your private key, they can use it to send your Bitcoin to someone else without your knowledge.

Its a bit of a carry over from a time when fees were just pennies.. They make money from trades. Also, Coinbase has very high fees for everything so that makes up for the withdraw fee that GDAX eats.  They may stop eating that fee in the near future though...

Right. If you still have your 0.02 BTC, then you didn't lose any BTC...
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:50:34
If the amount of coins that you hold on Coinbase is small (whatever your idea of small is), then I would just keep them on Coinbase until things either die down a bit or scaling solutions are adopted. Coinbase is relatively safe to keep small amounts on.  If you have a LOT of Bitcoin on the exchange, I would just eat the fee and move the Bitcoin to a wallet that you control the private keys. Coinbase does not give you access to your private keys, and in the world of crypto, if you don't own your keys you don't own your crypto. In terms of using GDAX, that will save you the exchange fees, but the mining fees (those are the high ones right now due to the volumes), those will stay the same and would have to be paid.

This is the trouble of trusting your money in a central agency such as a bank, they can literally just turn off your money and they tell you who you can and cannot deal with.

I think we can both agree that there is much speculation and no one knows which token will reach mass adoption. In fact, I believe there is space for many different tokens with many specializations to be mass adopted for whatever the needs are in the future. I can also agree with you that Bitcoin's future is unknown and I just don't know if it will be the de-facto store of value. All I know, right now at this moment, it has a very strong brand and a strong development support with Layer 2 innovations on the way (well, in all honesty they are already available but are not widely adopted) which are ahead (in terms of innovation and technology) of most of its competition. As Andreas A. states, the most valuable token/coin is the one that is most used and adopted. There will always be something new and better around the corner, but it doesn't mean it will always end up being used.

Most people who begin this adventure buy Bitcoin via   Once purchased, most people just leave the Bitcoin on the exchange, but that is not recommended (due to the fact that you don't actually own it because it is not under your control (thats a story for another time)).

That is correct, you will need your seed words eventually (even if you have a hardware wallet, because that can become lost or it could even become obsolete: think USB type-A and USB type-C (the new port on new Apple products)). A hardware wallet also displays these seed words for you to write down and secure. You do not need to have a hardware wallet, but it is more safer for large amount of Bitcoin since it is not directly connected to the internet.  A note on keeping Bitcoin on Coinbase: Never do that. Coinbase does not give you access to your private key (or the seed words) which means that they have full control over your Bitcoin which means that you effectively do not own "your" Bitcoin. Always move your coins to a wallet that allows you access to the private keys as well as the seed words.

Just replying to your edits.  Lets follow this train: you have $100 worth of BTC, you sell/trade for ETH, you pay that trade fee to the exchange (I don't know how much it is, but it COULD be more then a typical BTC transaction fee), you transfer your ETH to another exchange/address, the fee is low indeed. Then you need to purchase BTC with your ETH and you also pay a trade/buy fee (unless you are using limit orders, etc) which could cost some amount. In the end, you may end up paying more fees this route than just sending the BTC to another BTC address.  Now, you can also use an exchange that supports Segwit (Gemini for example) and send your BTC using that exchange to a Segwit enabled wallet/address, and pay tiny fees..  many confusing options here, I know, but this is the wild wild west of crypto currently.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:12:00

No it doesn't. The fork will create another blockchain, the B2X blockchain. It does NOT affect the regular Bitcoin blockchain. Once the fork happens, they go their separate ways, hence "fork".  The previous attempt was to subvert and "upgrade" the main Bitcoin blockchain and keep calling it BTC, but most exchanges and people decided it will be called B2X and keep the original Bitcoin blockchain as BTC, so it all fell apart.  This is exactly like me forking the Bitcoin blockchain and calling it B3X.. will it have enough support? I doubt it.

I'm not aware of any wallets that you have to "pay fees for their services". There are transaction/mining fees for moving Bitcoin from address to address, but this fee is not going "to the wallet" company/developers.  In terms of wallet recommendations for multiple tokens, Jaxx is a big one, but they don't support Bitcoin bech32 (segwit) addresses yet. Hopefully they will adopt segwit soon..
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:02:49
Coinbase (and any other exchange for that matter) must first support B2X. If they don't add that to their list of coins they buy/sell, you won't be getting your B2X on your coinbase account.  In order to gain access to B2X you will have to have get a wallet that supports B2X and "restore" access using your seed words or private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:42:13
If you leave your Bitcoin on Coinbase (or any other exchange for that matter, this includes gdax), you don't actually own your Bitcoin.  The reason for that is that Coinbase does not allow you access to the private keys which give you control of your Bitcoin.  If you don't have access to your private keys, and Coinbase goes down, gets hacked, gets shut down by the government, or any other event, you lose access to your Bitcoin. Wallet software/hardware allow you access to your private keys there by giving you control and allowing you to restore access to your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:37:14
Another way you can loose your coins if Coinbase gets shut down, or Coinbase decides to go out of business.

If you have a substantial amount of crypto (it all depends on what you see as substantial), definitely move the crypto off the exchange. When you store crypto on the exchange, you don't actually own it. The exchange has full control of your crypto because you don't have access to your private keys on the exchange. When you move them to a wallet, you control and own your crypto. As an example, if you give someone a $100 in cash to hold, that cash is no longer in your control because you don't own it anymore.. you trust the other person to give it back to you when you request it back.

My understanding is that on average the Segwit transactions are 75% cheaper relative to the regular transaction fees.  So, in your 300 sat/byte regular fee, you would be paying 75 sat/byte in a segwit transaction.

Sorry, I wish I could help you out, but I don't know enough about this..  From what I understood is that if you made the mistake of sending BTC to a BCH address, that transaction would not be confirmed or it could be lost, so you may be SOL..
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:59:10
Jaxx is a good solution, but, they have not implemented Segwit yet and they take a while to implement new technology features.  The user interface is great though and it seems like they have good support but it just takes a while to implement stuff.

Etherium is very much different than Bitcoin.  It is not ment to be used as a currency or a store of value.  It is a platform for building decentralized applications and smart contracts.  It makes use cases for blockchain technology other than store of value or exchange of value.  Also, it is currently  in terms of "market cap" out of other similar platforms under development (EOS, STEEM, etc)
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:09:13
All forks are legit. Its all open source, so anyone can fork bitcoin if they want.  All it matters is if it will be supported by the community and developers and ultimately everyone else.

Nothing is stopping them. In fact, they are probably working on their own token.  This is likely actually the future of all crypto in terms of value exchange.  Everyone is going to create their own tokens at varying prices and we will be exchanging/bartering coins for goods with blockchain running/storing "conversions" from one token to another.  It is possible that what we know as Bitcoin will become some sort of point of reference or even a store of value instead of an actual value exchange medium. Andreas A. explains this in more detail.

if you have your Private keys or your seed words, just use another wallet such as Mycelium and import those seed words. This will recreate your account and you will have access to whatever coins you had in that account. Coinbase is an exchange. I'm not sure what you are asking here...

No. If you buy ALT coins, you do not buy Bitcoin.  They are totally separate.  Certain exchanges will allow you to trade ALT coins directly for fiat currency.

More of a technical blockchain scaling question here; Does the Bitcoin blockchain have to keep ALL previous blocks? What would happen if the blockchain kept only say the last rollilng 50 blocks and discards the rest? This way the blockchain would keep the Genesis block and the last 50 blocks, keeping the blockchain size to a minimum and keeping bandwidth costs of running a node to a minimum? Would this help with scaling in any way?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:33:16
Also depends on the part of the world you live in. If you are in the US, Gemini is indeed a popular alternative.

If you had your balance since 2014, then you do have your Bcash, somewhere.. Try another dedicated Bcash wallet (non-Electrum) and restore your access via seed words on that wallet. That may work, but honestly I don't know how to help you in this case.

Adoption takes time. It is up to individual wallet developers, miners, node runners and exchanges to adopt segwit. The technology is ready, but people move slowly.  Because Bitcoin is open-source and decentralized, there is no central authority to force others to adopt changes.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:54:32
You can use localbitcoins.com  This is more of a peer-to-peer style exchange site where individuals say they have Bitcoin for sale and you deal directly with them. I've never used it, but I don't think there is any kind of verification. Basically you send money directly to the person and they send you Bitcoin. The site ranks sellers/buyers so you can see reputation etc..
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:35:32
native core adoption? Segwit is already active (since August) on most full nodes of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:26:32
Well, considering this is a Bitcoin forum, I'm not sure if you will find too much info here about what you are asking...
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:13:22
no, they technically cannot do it because they don't have segwit.

Just keep holdin on to it. This is still just beginning...
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:02:38
1. You don't need to send your Bitcoin anywhere because as long as you own Bitcoin prior to any fork, you can always "redeem" the forked coins by using a wallet that supports the new coin/token.  With that in mind, it is always a good idea to keep your coins/tokens off the exchange so that you have control over your private keys/seed words.
2. I have no idea where this claim of "Satoshi's Bitcoin" comes from, but I fear that is total bullshit.  How would anyone give away BTC from Satoshi's wallet(s)? I really don't see how that is possible unless Satoshi him/herself would send each individual some BTC.

Question about "that" coin.  If their scaling solution pretty much only consists of making the block size bigger and bigger, how do you not see this as a short term solution that leads to centralization? Honest question, do you not believe we need long term, innovative solutions? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:51:48
beware of the fees though. The transaction fee may be more then what you have allocated to the paper wallet..

yes, its easier to make transfers using the hardware wallet because you sign the transaction with your private keys using the hardware wallet software.

I don't actually know if all governments are working on their own tokens, but we do know that Venezuela has announced a token called "Petro" which is "backed" by oil and gas. This is basically against the whole idea of a decentralized token that relies on math as a form of trust. Its gonna be a crazy future.  Research and learn as much as you can because if you don't, you will get left far far behind..
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:16:54
Ahh I see, so you believe in the originators "whitepaper" and do not wish to deviate? If the block size was 1GB, imagine the centralization. The sheer amount of bandwidth required would only be accessible to the biggest corporations thereby giving them full control and say in how it is further developed. This totally goes against the "whitepaper" creed of keeping Bitcoin decentralized. Also, do you not believe in going beyond what the original creator's vision was? Imagine if we were stuck with the original internet creator's vision, we wouldn't even be having this discussion in this format. We would be stuck with text only running on military owned servers...  Bitcoin must grow beyond the Layer 1 blockchain-only solution. We must embrace innovation.  Just increasing the block size indefinitely is not the answer.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:26:32
I do not believe there are any general guidelines for transaction fees. The fees are determined by network congestion and how many transactions are waiting to be confirmed. The more transactions that are waiting, the higher the miners charge to confirm a transaction. This also means that if there are less miners in the mining pool, those fewer miners can charge higher transaction fees because there is no other miners to "undercut" the mining fee.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:47:14
Decentralization aspects come from transaction verification, not how much people actually hold or what the price is.

1. Download a wallet app on your mobile. 2. Setup the wallet to generate the seed words. 3. Record the seed words and keep them in a safe place. 4. Transfer your tokens from the exchange to the wallet address.

If you are referring to the BTC price, then maybe it is relevant since many people may buy up BTC to "benefit" from gaining more B2X once the fork happens, but in terms of technology, this fork does nothing to affect Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:24:56
Also true. They try to undermine the original Bitcoin and promote Bitcoin Cash (Bitcoin copy with very shortsighted scaling solutions)

Bitcoin is tangible too, it has miners that devote electricity to solve cryptographic problems, it has people running full nodes to keep the network alive, it has a market place, etc.  All those things you mentioned that the US Dollar is backed on could collapse in a "bubble" (in fact it has multiple times in the past) as well.  Its only a matter of time since empires rise and fall. US Dollar won't be a dominant currency forever.

I'm not sure what you are asking.  You wouldn't be sending Bitcoin from Electrum to a Bitcoin Cash address generated by Electrum Cash.  This would not work.  You need to use your private key/seed words in Electrum Cash wallet to "restore" access to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain and thereby unlocking your access to your Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:24:52
Ok, I see people did not like my reply.  The reason why USD was backed by gold was for currency stability. Bitcoin is all but stable right now... The purpose for Bitcoin is to literally undermine, subvert and replace the USD and other government backed currencies (or at least to provide an alternative and let the market decide). Once Bitcoin (or another crypto) is stable, there is no reason to use USD.

Funny thing is, just a few months ago (ok, more like 7 months ago), fees were a non-issue.  Once the price started jumping around and media jumped on the bandwagon, that caused the uneducated masses to try to "cash in" on crypto and the network is not ready for this kind of volume yet. The one good thing that may come out of this crazyness is that there are a lot more eyes and fire on developing the Lightning Network sooner.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:55:26
My point was that a month and a half ago, when the price was 7 or 8 thousand, people were only hoping for 10K by Christmas. Then it went up to almost 20K (instead of 10K). But it looks now that we will hit that 10K price after all.

As far as I know, the closest we have to a decentralized exchange is localbitcoins.com On this peer-to-peer style "exchange" you deal directly with people who buy/sell Bitcoin.

Well that depends on what it is worth to you. Because the fees are currently so high, I would probably just leave it on the exchange for now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:21:25
Are you suggesting that these wild price jumps and dips are related to all the people that keep changing their opinions on the scaling debate every 10 minutes? I venture that 90% of people who deal in crypto have no idea what they are buying or selling. They are here just for the "get rich quick" scheme. They don't care about the technology.  The price swings are full on market manipulation by influences and then people jumping on the bandwagon (and jumping off). 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:33:01
Bitcoin has the largest and most diverse pool of developers, so the support for improving and scaling Bitcoin is strong.  Other alts have 1 or 2 man development "teams" (most are just abandon-ware/scams/shitcoins). Some of the bigger platforms such as Etherium (note: Etherium is a platform, not a currency but it does have its own tokens) have larger dedicated teams of developers. So, in terms of store of value Bitcoin is the biggest that we have so far because it has the most stable technology and has the biggest development support.  Also, I agree, if another alt gets Amazon, its value will go through the roof. Chances are that amazon will actually create their own currency/token instead of adopting Bitcoin or any other alt coin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:52:00
Well, if you want to "benefit" from any fork, just make sure you actually own your Bitcoin by having access to your private keys and seed words. For anyone keeping their tokens on the exchange, good luck to you because the exchange gets to keep that forked token (unless they graciously give you access to it in the form of support for the token).
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:39:10
plug it in to USB to recharge? Remember, its not like the wallet actually holds digital coins locally.. A wallet (software or hardware) only gives you access to the "amount" of Bitcoin that you have on the blockchain.  Bitcoin itself is just an abstract and it lives on the network, not on local wallets.  You can use 10 different wallets and if you restore access using seed words/private keys, all 10 wallets will display the same amount since they are all on the same access key.  Of course, you can generate another private key on another wallet if you want and now you will have 2 different sets of keys on 2 wallets..
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:54:44
Hmm.. interesting idea, but in my experience no such service exists. Most people that buy crypto via exchanges are required to be verified with all kinds of credentials (driver's licence, social, bank account, etc).
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:56:54
Strictly speaking about BTC vs. ETH. BTC is meant to be a store of value as well as a digital currency. Etherium is a platform for development of smart contracts. Two different things here. Ether can be used as a "currency" between these smart contracts, but it is not meant to be used as a retail point-of-purchase currency. Etherium definitely has a future in terms of things like storing real-estate deeds, decentralized uber-style applications, etc. Bitcoin has a future in terms store of value and as an actual digital currency that you can buy stuff with.  Both have strong philosophy and strong development teams working on improving and mass adoption, but, they are used for different things. I would hodl both if you can afford it.

Bitcoin Cash is indeed a copy with some tweaks (mainly an increase to the block size) of the original Bitcoin. Most of the mining pool for Bitcoin Cash is in China (but then again, same holds for the original Bitcoin).

You have to think long term. Look at the price and market cap of all tech stocks/companies now vs what they were in 2001. We are talking orders of magnitude higher market cap.  Same will happen with crypto. In 10 years you will see the market cap in trillions, maybe even in quadrillions for all we know. Of course there are going to be dips and rises.. the important thing to look at is long term growth and the impact it has on various economies.
