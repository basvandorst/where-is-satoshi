After examining the logs provided by  earlier it is now clear that there is a damaged transaction in the wallet which is in turn preventing export of the private keys:This discovery raises this support issue to one where you'll need a trusted and experienced Java developer to unpick the wallet and manually retrieve the private keys through a debugger. This is a time consuming operation and I am not able to do this work at the present time. 
This is the response.
The Multibit coder can't resolve this problem because dont have time, how many other members of btc community should have this problem to make time to resolve it????
This bug is from 2012 in Multibit and nobody made nothing .
