Yes! All of this

Appreciate the concern, and I've been quite conscious of this. Andreas deliberately publishes all his Youtube content under a Creative Commons License, which means that anyone can modify and redistribute as long as the correct attribution is given. From Wikipedia, 
"A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of their own work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work". 
I believe each item that I've reposted contains the correct attribution to both the author and the source material, but please let me know if you think otherwise.

That's the plan! Well, not me personally but I am training an army of robots to take care of that for me.

Nice! Followed.

I don't have the resources just at the moment to seed a torrent, but I have managed to put everything onto Google Drive, at least for the time being.

I'm just a fan, that's all. I do think that if more people listened to what he has to say, that they would have a better understanding about the disruptive potential of this new class of technologies, and not be so worried about what the price is doing, or whatever FUD of the day is going around.

I would if I could get access to the api so that I can programmatically upload. At the moment SC have stopped taking applications for api keys, and I don't have the patience to upload files one-by-one.

Thanks! Mixcloud has a few limitations in that it won't accept clips shorter than around 10 mins, so your suggestion might not make it. This is the reason there are only 90 or so clips uploaded.
The main reason for choosing mixcloud however was due to the fact that I could use its api to post, and not have to manually upload and edit shows. My whole process is automated from start to finish. Soundcloud for example is currently not allowing new app registrations in order to get api access, plus it has limitations on how much content can be posted for free.

Yeah... thing is I don't know how to write metadata tags into ogg opus files. Do you know any node packages that will do this?

Good question. There's around 4GB worth of mp3 files in total. I'll think about setting up a way of hosting and accessing them and get back to you.
