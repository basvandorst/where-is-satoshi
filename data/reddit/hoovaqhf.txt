I wouldn't buy cloud mining share, there are so much scams out there be cautious. And yes buying mining hardware and join to pool is still a good idea. Last months buying Bitcoin is more profitable than mining because price is skyrocketing, so nobody knows which one is more profitable. Sometimes Bitcoin sometimes mining, I've heard that some miners regret of buying hardware instead buying Bitcoins last months. Both buying Bitcoin and buying mining hardware are good choices.

Usually, largest pools. Then reward is diversified to miners in that pool by work contribution. If yoou have more hash power that means that you have contributed more than a miner who has less hash power. More hash power = bigger reward.

And yes you can create your own pool.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:25:39
Yes everyone knows, pool that solves proof of work solution first is getting reward.

I don't understand your question exactly, nevermind. As one guy explained earlier, most miners mine in a pool, because probability of finding a block is bigger. Now you will ask yourself how is probability of finding a block bigger in a pool?
Answer is: because in a pool there is 100/1000/10000 miners who work as whole and have more hash power than one miner who isn't included in pools.

@_date: 2017-11-06 13:20:47
Yeah, I agree bloodbath on Bitcoin is coming.

I transfered my BTC from Bitstamp to Ledger Nano S during the fork, my transaction got confirmed in 494784 block. Will I get forked coins?
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:45:44
Not yet, around $5000-$5500.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:09:08
$5000-$5500 will be the bottom.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:47:01
Bitstamp right now is 6730
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:37:59
on which exchanger?
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:53:40
Oh ok, but if chain splits successfully, will I recieve SegWit2x coins because my transaction got confirmed on exact block that is supposed to fork?
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:08:27
If you choose SegWit you will have SegWit address, Legacy = non-segwit address. Segwit in my opinion is better, faster, cheaper.
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:25:58
Before 2-3 weeks.
