Well he said he got all the files on the computer and I did a search and see nothing with Krypto or bitcoin in my computer. I wouldn't know what else to look for. I guess Ill contact Krypto kit and ask them what or where I should look at but I have a bad feeling Im fucked. It synced up automatically when I signed into Chrome and first thing it did was generate a new address. It was like 3.5 btc

I did this (on my new SSD after my data and files were transferred) and the one group I found, I imported the 50 character string I found and it came up that I had no balance. Was hoping there was another way or somewhere else to look. Is there a chance that I would find it there on my original hard drive and it would be a different address than the one I found on the new hard drive? 
Sorry if this confused you. Thanks for trying to help

no, no transactions at all.
I just loaded up the Krypto Kit app , it synced and created me a new wallet

I dont think it was because I imported the string successfully to my krypto kit btc browser wallet. The public address which then showed in wallet was found in the same file typed right before the 50 char string I imported. 
 It just didnt have any balance in it. 
It does give me a bit of hope that there are more keys somewhere accessible on my drive since I do know I have an Ethereum one on there that I havent come across yet either.

I would never do such a thing without any concrete proof, and have no idea what you inferred to even make such a statement.

Thanks I already did the .....\local extension settings thing and found one file which had a string but unfortunately it didnt have my balance on it when I imported. Any chance there are multiple files to search for?
Thanks for reaching out.

Nice community. Upvote someone who doesn't give any constructive advice and downvote a beginner asking a legit question. Thank you to all the people who took the time out to give me a real answer. I was able to find a key in the location extension settings area but for some reason it shows zero balance as well. Woke up with a clear head this morning and did some detective work to track down a transaction I know I did and actually found the public key for the address Im looking for and the btc is still in there so thats a start. I dont know if I will be able to recover it but I know it's still there.

I was on Windows 10 on my original hard drive and after I had all my data and files copied, I went back to Win7. 
I looked in the appdata\Local\google.....\Local extension settings files and found one but the key didnt have the balance on it. Is there a chance there are other keys I didnt find?
