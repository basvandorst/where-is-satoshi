The key never leaves the device, so compromise is nearly non existent.  and the manager is technically not required as part of setup. It's only a way to handle firmware updates and use their wallet if you want.  I use electrum and it works just fine.  You'll be fine.

Amazon. It's on prime too. Can validate legit as well.

How are you sure its "kicked off" the mempool? Technically a TX is on the pool until its confirmed or RBF is done.  There is a default to expire a transaction on teh nodes, but they can be overwritten to never expire as well.

Only put what you are willing to lose to hack/other on an exchange. You don't have much options otherwise honestly. Market orders are probably the most secure way to do it quick. But you would be reactionary to do it that way.

Until you go to update it. Chrome is needed to update the firmware and stuff. Electrum works fine for it though.

Amazon prime one day shipping. Ordered last night, arrived this morning..

No. Assuming hardware wallet, the key will never leave the device.

Re send it with the same addresses and a higher fee. The old transaction will be overwritten due to double sending. Do a bit of research to learn how.

I don't believe so. It just makes recovering those keys easier.

It's just a BTC address. Should be fine?

I think you underestimate the amount of background stuff goes on in the finance world. Analytics alone are massive for these companies. Let alone how your transaction is actually completed.

That is what we all do

Cloudflare is just DDOS mitigation and CDN. They probably ride AWS on the backend.  Also, for something like Coinbase, they are outside of the realm for something like EB. Definitely a more complex setup than a basic app..

EB is great for more simple applications without complete control.  Moving up from there the other obvious options are OpsWorks and Cloudformation along with the code* solutions for CI/CD.  EB is kind of restrictive when it comes to full tunability of the underlying services.
