I think Silkroad is a big backbone to it, Silkroad is the biggest market for bitcoins in my opinion, i could be wrong but you cant overlook it.

You're wrong, many tip in this subreddit and that's without gain. It's just down to the recipient being worthy. :)

Or you can buy drugs for your friends and act as a middle man! I've bought some weed off Silkroad but i have friends who smoke a lot of weed and atm im acting as a middle man for them, im not making profit because they're my friends and im not doing it for money im doing it as my bit to bitcoin for keeping it strong. If everyone was doing this we'd all be so much better off.

I cant tell if joking or trolling but yeah people  need to stop trying to panic new investors/scare them. I don't think people realize that circulation is good for us and scaring people into selling drops the price more and takes one more person out of the game.

Will gladly give it a play :) Hope it gets big, the more people making businesses out of bitcoin the better!

My apologies, im at work so don't get much time to read threads, i just scrolled down and didn't see anything :) Glad you've invested some.

How can you keep saying how 'epic' all of this has been, is it just because you've already made your money and couldn't give a shit that you contributed massively to the current downfall of bitcoin?

Im thinking it's to do with Silkroad being Ddos'd. It's been down now for a few days, considering it moves over $20m a year in sales all via bitcoin i imagine the panic + loss of trading over the few days would easily be enough to have the price slump. Once SR is back up i imagine we'll see a big price.

Im surprised no ones said it yet but if i were you i would not hold so much on silkroad and i would have it stored away on a paper wallet. There are guides all over the web that explain different methods.
Enjoy your new wealth and invest some before you blow it all away, 100k wont last you a lifetime :)

Im with you, i told friends and family how bitcoin is the future and its finally getting picked up, i knew a crash was coming, thats always the case but the value has completely been destroyed by the constant fuck ups of exchanges and its just so embarrassing that one exchange can go down and the whole system goes into chaos. Im holding onto my coins as i invested with the whole 'invest what you can lose'. It stings that ive lost money but its worse that i put so much belief in this and now im watching it crumble. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:45:46
Fucking nice. It's people like you who deserve your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-09 10:16:56
DO NOT USE PAYPAL
I second this, please don't use it. Ive twice bought bitcoin on ebay and both times the sellers tried to screw me over, i got my money back so its fine but i can so easily turn the tables and con a genuine seller using paypal, don't use it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:11:56
Today alone ive seen so many begging threads, expect even more scams and begging the more noticed bitcoins become. Really sucks reading through new submissions right now lol
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:56:00
Having seen how easy it is to completely disrupt bitcoin value, i've lost all faith.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:06:27
Good news for all of us, having the backing of the porn industry would make have bitcoins booming!
Also boobies!!
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:34:47
Blimey, you want £45,000 and expect to get it just by saying its your dream? I dream to have £45,000 so that i can put my daughter into private education, i already have a better reason than you. 
Eitherway good luck my friend.

I agree, we need more people spending rather than holding. Although every day new businesses come on board but most are pretty small (but not to mention every little helps!). Hopefully someone big will get on board and that will strengthen it enough for the other fatcats to get in on it too.

That and its very fascinating for those who want to see bitcoin become a revolutionary new currency to have the thoughts and opinions of the very first early adopters.
I would love to see an AMA with him.

I spent £11500 on about 10Grams of Weed. It hurts :( but weed/silkroad is what got me into bitcoins in the first place! Sadly i was late to the boat but C'est la vie !
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:15:30
Well im in!
@_date: 2013-07-09 22:08:02
Thank you! Your plan worked, ended up funding £5 and lost it lol. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:16:28
Thanks! :D

No one gives out free money. Anything 'free' is accompanied by surveys and what not which all end up making you a couple of cents for hours of work if that.
Personally, i dont trust your link and would advise anyone to not click it
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:24:33
haha yeah that's a good point. I don't see it that way as my friends will buy be it via silkroad or from a street vendor so i saw it as an opportunity to get some more people involved into bitcoins but yes it is considered dealing and very illegal. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:23:59
Im in :). Always great to see new and up coming businesses around bitcoins, not only that but what a great prize!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:06:09
I too had a very small amount of bitcoin left that i did end up getting what i paid originally back, so i cant complain! ^^
