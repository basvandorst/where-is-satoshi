Imo, we need to wait for BTC to stabilize a bit more before committing to a new base unit.

How many people starved before these programs? Was starvation a problem in the 1800s? Or should we return to relying on each other rather than being dependent on the government for everything?

I'm 90% sure they are application-specific.

On mobile so pardon my brevity. Set up an electrum wallet with seed phrase, transfer coins to wallet, and safely store your seed phrase somewhere is can't be damaged or lost. I engraved mine on aluminum and brass in my and my parents safe.

I just submitted for verification yesterday... I've been using gdax but bitstamp's interface is miles ahead of what gdax does and since the fees are the same I figured I might as well move to the more advanced exchange.
What kind of wait time should I expect?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:15:53
Lol yeah, I kind of meant specifically, like telling my friend that I buried it under the apple tree in my back yard.

The difference is that the government can only give what they have previously taken by force.

You can build it from the source if you want.

0.25% seems to be the going rate. Gemini and BitStamp both do trades for 0.25% with volume discounts.

I am in the process of cashing out of Coinbase into paper. I am transferring my coinbase coins to my electrum wallet. The seed phrase for my electrum wallet is etched onto a piece of aluminum in my parent's safe and on a piece of brass in my safe (the only metals I had handy to etching). I have too much invested in coin to risk anything happening to the paper.
If you want step-by-step help feel free to pm me and I'll be happy to help.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:58:34
I remember my first purchase. Its a real anus-clencher, but the trends are clear that bitcoin likes growth.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:49:51
I agree. Considering the massive spike up to 17k this is kind of a 'soft' correction. Only the future can tell, but the fact that it didn't drop after the big jump is great news. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:04:39
I set up an account with Gemini and was immediately underwhelmed. BitStamp has an incredible trade interface and is much easier to use.
BitStamp is taking their sweet time verifying my account, but I'd recommend you check them out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:30:36
Electrum generates an array of public/private keys with your seed phrase. I don't recall exactly how many and I don't have a wallet on my pc at the moment, but I think there are a dozen addresses generated with each seed phrase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:03:23
I'll give you a quick guide when I have access to a real keyboard. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:26:27
Which means Bitcoin won't be viable as a currency for a long time. The gains are awesome, but if it is going to be useful as a daily-used currency it needs to stabilize.

I just moved all of mine from Coinbase to cold storage. I feel so much better now that only my fuckups can ruin my cash.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:12:38
It is normally a slow process, but with how busy they've been lately I'm sure the list is super long. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:57:59
Well that sucks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:06:38
There really isn't a good, easy guide that I found.
Basically you recreate your wallet with your seed phrase, then use Electrum to send some coin to a wallet you have on Coinbase or wherever. Then you can exchange for fiat or do whatever else you want.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:33:41
Its hard to tell. You only know it is a true crash after it is all done. Until then you clench your butthole and hope it is an overdue correction.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:13:36
I think CoinBase took almost a week to get me verified, and that was ~2 months ago, so I guess that is just the way it goes now. The downsides of a growing asset.
I wrote a trading bot that accessed gdax, but since their graphing tools suck I use bitstamp to actually view moving averages and such. The only problem is that slight difference between the two which makes tweaking the bot a little more difficult than it could be.
Oh well, I'm patient.

10% of the time I'm correct 100% of the time.

The thing about BCash is that it does a lot of things well. There are definite upsides to that coin (whether it balances out the negatives is debatable), but the fact that it tends to draw underhanded deals and unethical operators means I'll never own a penny of it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:35:08
You can add funds from any source using you electrum public key. From coinbase, bitfinex, your neighbor, etc. The public key needs not be secret at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:36:55
Look up 'paper wallet'. I'm on mobile so it's a pain. Basically you store too public and private keys I'm physical media. I used electrum and etched my seed phrase on a block of aluminum and a brass sheet. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:16:54
I was going to sell at $10k, then buy back in as close to that as possible if the dip reversed. Glad I didn't have to do that and the value seems to be bouncing back nicely. Hopefully slower this time around to it doesn't have such a hard correction.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:06:27
Bitstamp's exchange is amazing as well. The interface is miles ahead of anything else I've seen. I wish I had found them sooner, but I at least managed to get my verification request in before the mass exodus from Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:34:21
Well, you can't send to a seed phrase since it is just a means of 'encrypting' your addresses.
Anyone can send money directly to your electrum wallet using any of the public keys it contains. The base technology is the same no matter who holds the wallet (Coinbase, Bitfinex, you), the only difference in this case is that only you are able to know what your private keys are since they only exist on whatever physical medium you create.

I'm close to 100k so I'll have to remeber to ask about that. I have a long wait until retirement and they manage it fairly well so I'll hit 100k easily enough. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:11:31
Wild speculation.
Every day I see a new article about how BTC is going to skyrocket in value and a new article about how BTC is going to crash to pennies.
Nobody knows what the hell is going to happen. This is completely uncharted territory. Anyone who says they can predict BTC's value is a liar, an idiot, or both.

Hey my IRA is with vanguard. By far the best value I could find. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:13:24
I'm American and I have no idea what this meme is talking about. My bank doesn't charge me anything to hold my cash. Or withdrawals. Or transfers.
Investments are different. My IRA charges management fees and stuff for taking care of the investments, and there was a tiny charge for moving the funds from my old 401k to the IRA.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:34:53
Why do you have an account with only $10? Just keep it in your wallet if that is all the cash you have free.

I'm thinking about buying more, but buying when the value is at its all-time high doesn't make sense.

10,631 right now, 12:13am est. When I get up in the morning I expect to be very excited or disappointed.
I'm already pissed at my bank for taking its sweet time transferring funds so I wan't able to buy more and missed the post-10K spike.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:45:55
I'm hoping this drop lasts at least another day or two so my bank transfer clears.
I kind of expected a bit of a drop after $10k since a lot of people will sell after that milestone, but I have no reservations about the ability to rebound easily.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:47:22

Not when we *give* it to them. Garbage hyperbole headline.
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:41:03
It took 5 years for it to become true. No bank is going to be worried when BTC is trading for pennies. The past few months are the best indicator for the future. A huge spike, a huge crash, and relative stability around $10k. Stability is all we need to take over the world. As much as I'd love to see my BTC gain in value, it should only grow relative to inflation if it has any chance of being a common currency.

Which is horrifying when you realize the Federal Reserve can drastically change the value of a dollar simply by entering a new line on their ledger.
@_date: 2018-04-13 04:22:59
The supply is limited to 21 million. If you add up all of the pieces you will have a max 21 million. Divide a hundred pennies any way you want, it is only worth $1.
