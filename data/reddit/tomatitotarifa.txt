Finally got it solved. They said they had disabled all withdrawals after they were hacked a long time ago, and they that they took long to respond due to backlogs. So, all good now. Thanks for replies.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:02:56
Yes! They are there as well! Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:16:53
Ripple the only one holding ground? Any ideas why?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:04:23
Thanks for all the responses! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:21:37
Thanks! It neatly summarizes my past behavior trading crypto, and maked me laugh at myself! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:46:43
Well, Bitstamp has blocked Bitcoin and altwithdrawals and are not responding to support tickets for 2 weeks...
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:12:20
As someone else said, don't be too hard on yourself; you probably would have sold much earlier than now (like when it went to 1,000$), and would still be beating yourself for it. I think very few people have held onto coins for this long, myself included. All the best. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:11:03
Thanks, I guess that's it. I think they probably disabled coin withdrawals when they had some problems with the hacking a while ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:04:44
Worth looking under the sofa cushions as well! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:33:52
BTW, I got Bitcoin Cash, any others I should know? Been off Reddit for these four years. Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:01:50
Also, I haven't been able to withdraw Bitcoins (or any other Alt) from Bitstamp, and they don't tell me why.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:41:10
In my account yes. Any clues how can I enable coin withdrawals then? As I said, they are not responding to my support tickets
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:44:11
Bet on Tonya Harding
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:06:11
But he _was_ correcting his English
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:07:45
Yep, with names as "Right Change", ha!
@_date: 2013-11-02 10:02:35
Maybe has arrived already
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:25:51
Someone in the comments sections actually urges him to short sell... hasn't replied AFAIK
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:36:54


Great advice! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:22:56
I had the exact same problem but eventually the funds showed up. Had to complain to my bank first, though.
However, I now have a 390 hour hold on any withdrawal.

I think this bubble is been fuelled by China
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:41:26
I think I got it. Similar to splitting gold into ever smaller amounts, yet the same gold is in existence. Brilliant!
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:27:20
The glass is half
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:23:20
Brilliant analogy! Let's just keep an eye on low overhead tunnels ;)
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:21:40
No hidden meaning here, just a related Spanish saying: "When you see your neighbour's beard getting shaved, start applying shaving foam to your own."

If they advertise recklessly like this, government will need to appear to be doing something about it. It could be that the easiest target will be to vilify bitcoin.
What's next, and ad in the Super Bowl??
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:35:27
It did look slighlty suspicious to me to write such a complete article on how to beat bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:37:41
Yes. And it also could be that a lot of americans just travel with their ID within the U.S. and a lot don't own a passport.
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:29:15
Amazed at the quality and speed of the answers. 
This is a dream come true: type a complex question (especially dealing with bitcoin) and get intelligent answers within minutes. Thanks to you humans behind this. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:22:03
Oh, he IS serious. Just look at the replies to the comment section.
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:45:50
The luggage is also bigger than the passport. I don't understand the rest of your reasoning either (maybe you meant 'couldn't'?)
I have myself forgot my wallet at times, but yet I had the passport and plane ticket with me (and the other way around as well.) So if it happens to me... It take it it can happen to others.
Good luck to OP with this adventure. I think you'll find Polish people quite friendly and helpful.

I get a "Money hold. 393 hours left" message to withdraw BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:39:18
Or to the moon
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:58:15
This message is displayed on the "Finances" page, when I click "Withdraw" next to BTC:
However, I have sent my IDs through the support tickets an the replied saying that they will request them from me when they are needed. Pretty strange.
"Money hold. 392 hours left
Why do I see such error? Hold is used in the following cases:
Changing/resetting the password, changing of the e-mail. For the purpose of security. Hold up to 3 days. It cannot be removed.
Depositing money from the payment systems with a high fraud activity. Hold from 1 to 7 days. It cannot be removed.
Depositing money through the wire transfer. The time of the hold is from 1 month. It can be removed by providing your IDs through the ticket."

Is it not banned in Thailand? You might need to wire money to an exchange outside of your country if you are allowed to do that. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:21:11
Well done there
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:27:01
I deposited EUR
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:44:38
And also... "it's not backed by anything"!
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:25:15
Reddit: it gives you the facts
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:57:07
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:37:07
Just did. Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:25:41
Wouldn't that be considered inflation, though?
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:28:01
Thanks. Sorry, I meant who actually filters or promotes content there. Not clear as far as I can tell from Wikipedia.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:06:08
Can you doubters explain what is so fishy? Somebody forgot their credit cards and cash while traveling. Happens every day. And it is a great story that will show the benefits of owning bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:47:13
Well, so was SR.. a drop in the bucket of drug trade, yet we all know what happened. They wanted to give a lesson.
