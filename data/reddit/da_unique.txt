A title that has stood for stability for many years. Something you should not just throw away. Why should any customer believe any altcoin to be better than the original bitcoin core? Sorry for calling it that, but in principle it IS an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:47:33
What makes you think this new "group of core devs" is gonna act any different in a year from now?
Perhaps they will make another hard fork then. When will this stop?
As much as I respect gavin for all his hard work and insight, he would be better off getting consensus within the current core dev team even if that means abandoning the idea of increasing the blocksize. Either way I will never support any altcoin that tries to replace the original bitcoin blockchain. But everyone can decide that for themselves, I guess i made my point. Take it or leave it.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:38:06
Thats what worries me the most, 1 year from now. At the pace bitcoin is gaining traction, at least from VC, 1 year from now will be much much too late. Bitcoin will probably be grinding to a halt when another adaptation period arrives.  How hard can it be for everyone to change within 2 months? Oh well.. politics..

Because block solving time should have nothing to do with creating these charts. If he wanted "10 minutes averaged" data, he could've just included all blocks and averaged them over the time. Worse yet most miners don't even use the right time. Example:[Imgur](

@_date: 2015-06-01 16:22:24
I dont think its a good thing to make an altcoin to push this change. Either it gets implemented in the standard bitcoin core, or it does not. So they better get some consensus in the bitcoin core project and make a damn decision.

Well the value of the ecosystem as you put it, is for 85% in bitcoin-core blockchain.. 
As far as I understand from bitcoinXT, even that was supposed to be run on the normal bitcoin-core blockchain, as evident from their website:
"Bitcoin XT is a patch set on top of Bitcoin Core, with a focus on upgrades to the peer to peer protocol. By running it you can opt in to providing the Bitcoin network with additional services beyond what Bitcoin Core nodes provide."
Changing the maximum blocksize means it is no longer running "on top" of the bitcoin blockchain, hence it becomes an altcoin.
We are talking about moving 3 billion dollar of value between a old and proven blockchain to a new untested blockchain. 
Goodluck getting anyone to support that.

My guess is that you are a btc-e user? 
Don't cry when all your coins have been confiscated...
If you truly believe bulgaria/cyprus/? will allow such an exchange in the long term you are probably a bit naive.
If you believe the European union will allow that exchange to exist you are just plain ignorant.
Either bulgaria/cyprus/? themselves will smash it down, or the EU will, its just a matter of time. If BTC-E has any common sense they at least introduce ID verifications ASAP. Even this doesnt help much if they get sued for money laundering before they implemented it... It is exchanges like btc-e and users like you who are actually damaging bitcoin. I only state the clear obvious.. if people get panic'd over that they should probably not have invested their money in such way in the first place.

I still don't get it. But thats probably because, in the NL, we are accustomed to be able to send money between peoples bank accounts with no fees and mostly within the hour.
Has been like this since what, 30 years?
"Recently" we got SEPA which also enables transferring money between European countries within hours, without fee.
On top of that we have a online payment system using debit card, where we can sign online transactions instantaneously using a hardware cryptographic signing device.
Even though I like bitcoin, it will be very hard to convert any normal user here. People don't care about inflation, banks, freedom, and other liberalism crap, since they are too busy working and running their lives.
That might change in WW3, but hopefully we wont see that for a long time.
It will be interesting when bitcoin can finally come up with a use case, interesting for the PEOPLE and not the corporate businesses.

That is actually how I thought about it too.
I guess I shouldn't have used the term "always" so loosely, since, I agree,  eventually it will hopefully mellow out.
That being said, I do not feel as comfortable in investing bitcoins anymore. The wales seem to dictate current prices way harder than the demand should. And without actual numbers which show how many mined bitcoins have been traded for fiat, we have no clue how the true market cap will look like.
We will see in the coming years if the prices will keep rising due to demand, or keep crashing every few weeks due to wales selling stuff around 1k$.
Its all in the hand of the general public's belief and adoption, and a gigantic amount in the hands of the top 500 richest bitcoin wales. I trust the public, do I trust those few individuals? I dont know. 
Too much volatility might even scare away the most fanatic investor/adopter.
I guess time will tell.

Same thing i thought. This new way of payment is slower than the old system. The physical card with pin code should be enough security. Maybe if the wallet is online, NEO could limit withdrawal amount/day like any normal bank card has, so if it gets stolen not all your coins are gone.
If a customer needs to buy a 100million yacht, he could unlock the limit for some hours and do it the same way.
Maybe an ever better solution would be to allow small payments to be made without any code, &gt;20$ or something with card pincode, and &gt;200$ with phone verification.

1) NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  
2) Buying or selling BTC.  
3) First question that makes sense. Many online savings banks link your savings account to 1 main bank account number. Which means you can only unload or load funds from that bank account. This prevents hackers from withdrawing money to another bank account. Simple yet effective security measure for fiat money.  
4) Look at my trading history?!  
5) See 2)  
6) NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS  
One additional question: please return my funds ASAP.
Before I call the authorities on you for abducting my funds.
People say its due to their KYC/AMLR/WHATEVER crap they are applying...but I have NEVER ever had such amount of bullshit at ANY bank or business.
Not like I can go to bitstamp and give them a suitcase of untraceable money... all transfers are ALREADY being checked by BANKS. You know, those who actually have to implement and use the KYC AML or whatever shitty legislation. Bitstamp should get their heads out of their fictive legislation ass, because I'm afraid they cant see where they are going.

6gb blocks would give 18ktps.
A normal 100mbit line could sustain this already...google/nsa etc would laugh at this figure. Go watch a 4k video on youtube to see the point.
Sadly we all still believe avg joe to host a full node on his 1mbit line, while in reality big corporations/cryptobanks will host them in the future.
Which is fine since normal users already trust thin clients like electrum. And corps/banks/govs will be checking eachother on the validity of the full nodes. Might be a day the miners use a thin mining script, relying on data from storage nodes which they pay for this service. (centralization..= cheaper)

Bug report, since i dont have a github account:
Coin control features: 
"Tree mode" inputs are not fully updated after a (multiple recipient) transfer to own addresses.
The original address and label is still present, showing change balance,  while it should show the new change address and label. 
This is displayed correctly in the "List mode".
FYI transaction was confirmed 4 times.
Thanks /remarks on gui functionality:
I found it odd that the full transaction details are not saved for multi recipient "payment to yourself" transfers. Only way to see which internal address I send what to is by manually matching their address to the transaction record on blockchain. Perhaps some way to improve this. 
Also when making multi recipient transfers, on the send page there is no summary of total coins that are going to be send. Only after initiating transfer you get a summary.
URI strings are not parsed on "Pay to"  field, no way to paste them directly in wallet?!
"Receive" tab does not allow quick copying of address using right mouse. Nor show address in gui, like possible in "transactions".
Thanks for considering.

Didn't read it fully, but I do agree with the transactions per second limitation.
When will there finally be a fork which allows &gt;1000 TPS?
I really do not see ANY reason why bigger packets are not allowed today. We are hitting the TPS limit almost daily now.
And its not like a limit of 1000 TPS would increase the blockchain much, since the miners would still require a transaction fee to be added. If bitcoin explodes mainstream this will be the thing that kills it, when all transactions go to a full stop. Heck for all I care the size of a block should not be limited at all, if the market requires 100k transactions in 10 minutes, so be it. Mostly there wont be that many transactions, due to fee's, so the blocks will only be as big as needed.
@_date: 2014-05-06 07:40:23
If anything, China is one of the most important countries to embrace btc.
Since the majority of products is sadly made in China.
So for people to import all those products, Bitcoin would be an ideal transaction method.
As a customer, I dont really need bitcoin in Europe, as i can pay with euro's in nearly all countrys.
Banking transaction fees are for free here, so even there Bitcoin can not compete. 
Transaction speed bitcoin could have an edge, since SEPA tranactions take 1 day or so.
In my own country, the online payment system is already very well defined and secure. Using my bank card and a hardware device I can sign transactions for free (most webshops pay for the fee themselves), and payment is instant. I personally like bitcoin for the freedom it could give, not that my current banking is so bad.
Not sure how americans use their banking system, but I guess their banks still rape them in the ass with crazy high fees. Fees the banks can easily cut or remove, in order to compete with the emerging bitcoin alternative.

If the system cant handle a few fake transactions, how is it ever going to handle global transactions between billions of people. Not even relating it to the number of transactions for CC's or bank cards, bitcoin will be used for micropayments which means a tenfold or more transactions.
How can the bitcoin devs be worried about a tiny ddoss, cant they see the tsunami of legit transactions the coming years?
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:50:14
I think he wants US banks to step up their game, so people will not have incentive to switch to bitcoin.
Same reason the European union is limiting CC fees to 0,3% maximum, even though most banking services here are lightyears ahead of US banking services. 
(Seriously, we do not really need bitcoin, our fully secure debit cards can already pay over the internet instantly, and the low fee's are usually taken care of by the seller.)
I have yet to see a valid reason "normal" people would be converting their money in bitcoin, untill then price will be low. I guess with the shitty banking in the US and the financial limitations of certain asian countrys, they will be the main ones pushing price. With maybe a few percent of the 3rd world country people adopting it.
Personally I like the pseudonymous and programmable nature of bitcoin, hopefully people keep building on top of that so normal people might like it too. Basically the race is on between the bankers and bitcoin. They surely are going to be taking this virtual thing seriously now even more big companies are getting into it.
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:03:16
A bit too basic explanation imho.
If that means that you receive that amount in 1 address, the tumbling service is pretty much useless.
If i send 1.245678 btc from A to a tumbler.
And that tumbler sends me 1.245678 btc to B, even if it is totally unrelated to the initial A, it should be very easy to link these together.
Things get harder if the tumber, as I indicated, would use multiple destination addresses, then the possibilities of matching the input A to a unknown output B would be much harder, albeit still doable, since I assume the tumbler will not hold on to your bitcoins for a long time.
For example if it only waits 1 hour, it would be 6 blocks to match, which is what, 12000 transactions? My core i7 would probably laugh at resolving that match. Things get more interesting if 10s or 100s of destination addresses are used. But you pay a top premium transfer fee then.

Personally i think this limits bitcoin in being widely accepted in face-to-face transactions. Solutions like mycelium are not the way to go, unless they make them free and secure. I don't see why customers should pay for obvious design limitations of the bitcoin protocol. The fees taken by the various bitcoin companys are quite stacking up. When spending &gt;850$ per month the 0.5% would be more in fees than my whole banking account costs per month, this is including 1 bank card, 1 creditcard, general banking security, internet banking, insurance and unlimited FREE transactions. Not to mention support when needed and ATM access all through europe where i can get paper cash without paying fees.
How was it again that bitcoin is going to be cheaper? :(
Without mass adaptation in general stores I doubt bitcoin will ever reach a market cap, that slow international transactions would make up for the hassle. So I truly dont understand the business model the starting bitcoin services are using... all they see is fees for every fart related to bitcoin :/
@_date: 2014-09-11 10:20:54
Anyone have an idea about the fee's involved?
For example Circle is using a 2.9% creditcard fee.. which is way too high imo.

Got mine too in the Netherlands.
But the banking is still disabled, so I cannot fund my account with Creditcard or the likes. Can deposit or withdraw btc.
Also got 10$, which is nice since the price is low now (495$)
This amount of btc is probably 100$ next year.
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:49:26
2.5% fee's, deposit 2000$ and you pay 50$ fee.
Thats more than I pay per year for a normal bank account, with debitcard, creditcard and online banking. 
The money is insured by .gov till 100k, and I can exchange my 'virtual' money to cash on about every street corner and be totally anonymous..for free.
Online transactions, guess what... FREE.
Bitcoin companies sure know how to scare away new customers, lol.

You should consider adding more selection criteria.
If i want to buy a tv, i want to select the size.
If i buy ram, i want to select size.
Etc. Also I do not see any inventory information, are the products I am ordering even on stock? Mostly people order and want it within 24 hours..
That having said, your prices are okish,when checking a r290x you are about 30€ more expensive than shops here. Although shops here mostly include the shipping cost...so if i take the 19.99 for delivery you are about 50€ more expensive. If I take your special deal example, the Lenovo T430 costs around 1000€ here in multiple shops: 
The MSI r290: 
Would be great if you could return the saved transactions costs in the actual pricing.
Good initiative though, keep up the good work.

I dont see a problem with bots trading.
I would have a problem if they actually fabricated buys/sells from thin air, which i have seen no evidence for yet.
Would be nice if graph sites could implement a option to filter out &lt;0.1btc trades all together, or average them out over a minute. And no I dont really like huobi, because i think trading fees should be implemented, which would also disable these annoying bot transfers. But claiming that huobi creates fake traffic without any proof is not the way to go imho.

Its what I hate about the bitcoin business in general, the shady people running the mayor exchanges.
Huobi, is it even legal?
BTC-E not even contact information? And good luck getting your money out of Russia.
Mt Gox you cant even get your money out.
And no decent US based exchange?
Then to think most good news comes from USA, it seems odd to not run a legal and decent exchange there.
Currently only bitstamp seems half legit, and that one is trading in USD, while 90% of its users are European.
If your trying to setup a global currency, at least allow trading in local currencies. 
Why give the currency exchange fees to the banks?
For simpleness of trading, we could still use USD numbers to buy or sell BTC, just apply the current NON-BLOATED USD exchange rate.

Gigantic numbers, "pin" code viewable from 3 km, hand palm scans? Are you kidding me?
My government wouldnt even get that information, let alone some stupid ATM. What a business model, maybe its normal in the USA to have iris, handpalm, dick and ass scans to verify your ID, here in Europe none of those are required, at ANY atm I ever seen.
If your so desperate to get the customers ID linked to their bitcoin address, just allow bank card deposits instead of cash. Not to mention the time it takes to make one deposit. Could've been finished in &lt;30 seconds, push in bank card, select amount, type in pin code, receive paper wallet. DONE. Why the hell do I even need to use my phone, unless they want to track that as well.. a) Customer deposit cash b) NSA get alarm, potential terrorist spotted c) Track ID and phone GPS in realtime. *sigh*

On average maybe, but even today we are hitting the near 1MB limit multiple times.

Ridiculous why they haven't increased that number yet, if anyone has recently tried to send btc they can clearly see 60+ minutes for 1 confirmation. Unacceptable.
Not totally sure how the trust system works, but I guess one could lower the difficulty and include more transactions per block, having the effective 10 minutes/block.
The "increased" traffic or blockchain argument against it makes no sense tbh.

Even imagine waiting 12 seconds for it to clear, its an eternity!
Would cost the business and the people a lot of money/time.
Great that there will be bitcoin companies who will take the risk of 0 confirmations, but if they ask 0.5% fees I wont be using them and many other people wont. Bitcoin is very strong in international and larger transfers, however that is not how people do daily business. Will be interesting to see how this will be solved.

Quite logical step for them. After they exit the eurozone, they need a new currency which they can use to trade with the rest of the world. Since they probably still have a bad aftertaste of the disaster called Euro, bitcoin might just be the solution they are looking for.

The sad thing is that the bitcoin price is still very related to the USD if exchanges keep using USD here in Europe and elsewhere in the world. If the USD crashes, bitcoin will too because its not balanced between the world currencies.
Another thing that puzzles me is the volatility in the long term.
If people actually use and keep bitcoin, as a currency, the liquidity on the exchanges will go down, which could result in a higher volatility and a easier way to manipulate the price.
I guess it will be hard or even impossible for bitcoin to find its own inherent value, not related to USD/EUR/CNY or whatever normal currency. I guess we can be happy if it will be valued one day by the average of all world currencies and people stop panic selling/buying.
So the question is, how will the bitcoin value be determined in the future? Still basic supply and demand? I surely hope not!

So if its true what he says, this would mean that actual businesses who would accept bitcoin, and depend on that transaction ID to verify which customer paid, could also be hacked?
Maybe they use other means to bind a transaction to a user, such as unique addresses, still it seems there might be other ways to exploid this bug.

I dont know, are there any way to chart which amount of bitcoin is actually paid for/traded?
Seems to me the bitcoin price will always be fucked like this by people who mined a gazillion bitcoins in the beginning, and dump 1k of them regularly to cash in.
Would mean that the actual trade value is always influenced by people who have nothing to lose. 
Seeing how few people actually own a large share of all bitcoins, i guess this will keep going on for a while :(

I am not confused. I have had several transactions in the past with 0.0001 btc fee, that would be stuck for over an hour without any confirmation. Even 1.5 hours after posting they only got 1 confirmation.
If you send someone BTC, say a friend, and his wallet makes him wait 3 or 6 confirmations before he can spend it again, he will be looking at a balance that is stuck for hours. Clearly it seems to run better at THIS moment, however 2 weeks ago this was very different. Seeing they were spammed with TX malleability attacks, maybe this caused it. Seems pretty simple still to disrupt a global payment system just by ddossing it a bit. :( I still have hope they can fix it in the long term. Maybe a good read for you:

Why have a 2 way ATM anyway already?  
First we need people to be able to BUY bitcoins.  
Cant get much simpler than:
1) Enter creditcard or debit card  
2) Enter amount and pincode  
3) Take paper wallet out.  
4) DONE.  
This is fast, you got all ID information through the plastic card used.  
No paper money laundering, no need to store value in your machines.
No need to fiddle with your phone, which is usually empty anyway.  
Whoever thought up your process should be fired imho.  
Did you even do research how long such handscanner will even function properly? Better yet, does it even function properly?  
A bit of bad weather and the thing is dusted, scratched or whatever. Or youth will just spraypaint it out of boredom. What a disaster to happen.  
Not to mention that I would never put my hand inside a public machine.
God knows what people or animals put in there.
Next machine you first introduce a bitcoin debit card, which a customer registers on his name. 
With this card he can spend his money in basically all stores on the planet.  
He can also use it to charge and uncharge bitcoins using your ATM, using cc/debitcard or cash.
And if your smart you also start a online wallet service, to link to that card, so people can spend coins virtually as well, and charge/uncharge it using online banking.

This problem, which seems to repeat itself over and over again, is the only thing that really worries me about bitcoin in the long term.
A trust-less system, which is not really trust-less... at all.
Next to this I am afraid quantum computers will crack this whole algorithm in like less than 10 years, but yea perhaps the developers will find better encryption methods by then :) The slow confirmation time is also a bit worrisome... but this will be solved i guess, the sad thing is that the solution is probably by using centralized companies (eg bank-like payment processors like bitpay)..

So your saying wallmart or similar would accept this 0 confirmation transfer? When would an amount be considered large enough to need a confirmation in your opinion.
Bitcoin-qt wallet for sure does not accept it. My money been stuck for nearly 1.5 hours now, even with 1 confirmation.
What if i actually need to spend it now? I cant, its stuck! Mhh think I should probably investigate alternative coins, because I doubt this will ever be solved in bitcoin without ridiculous added fees by 3rd party people, who I didnt want to do business with in the first place.. The power is being your own bank, I guess that power is not for daily usage meant.

Take any recent transaction on the blockchain and u will see that is truly not the case anymore. 
I dont know why either, just took the max daily # transaction graph from blockchain, and calculating that back to second would be 1.18 transactions/second on average. So it shouldnt take so long for sure.
/update: ok just looked at the wikiguy one, that one seems okish now.
Maybe the ddoss or something fucked all the transactions a while ago. Will keep an eye on it though.

Trade volume does not say much if there are different fees between exchanges.
I guess the orderbook depth/liquidity is probably a better measure, even though this is also influenced by the fees. (but not as extreme as the trade volumes)

I dont understand why these sites dont disallow unknown IP's to access it, without confirmation by email.
At least give a customer the option to enable such ip based system. Many customers have static ips, so they could basically lock out every other ip by default.
@_date: 2014-07-13 10:13:52
Sadly my guess is that before any limit is relaxed, the fees will skyrocket first. Especially since the miners have all the power to do whatever they want (eg the governments of bitcoin). Hence I cant wait for them to start meeting and discussing this crap just like governments do.

Even if double spend is unlikely, Id rather see my payment for something expensive be at least once confirmed within an hour.
There is no reason not to increase it already, clearly more and more people are using legit transactions compared to a half year ago. Id rather see the bitcoin protocol catch up. The slow confirmation speed might do it more damage than a bit of increase, if any, of the blockchain size. Not to mention it is a good test to find any bugs with larger transactions/block BEFORE it goes mainstream.

I dont know, i just followed the flow. It never reached the part to fill in the change address. It auto loaded some new page when i made the payment, telling me to give the change address. Which was impossible. The thing that bugs me is that there is nowhere any warning that this system is still in pre pre pre pre pre pre alpha. Not funny when it concerns peoples money, and when bitcoin core devs are announcing it people might assume that it actually works..

Well some say servers are only in bulgaria. Company is in cyprus? Well what do we really know, next to nothing.
Banks are in czech and Georgia.
Quick googling on benificiary address info from georgia bank:
Beneficiary: 	Computek Merchant Limited
Beneficiary Address: 	SUITE B 29 HARLEY STREET, W1G 9QR LONDON, United Kingdom - GB 
And you find this URL:
Doesnt give much confidence eeh?
Aparently that address is from:
 and specifically 
So doesnt say 100% finance-ltd are same people, but a lot matches for sure, including the russian ownership.
The other banking account is in name of  who also shares address with  and perhaps many more.
So in the end we have no clue at all who actually runs BTC-e, I guess only criminals or idiots see advantages for usïng that exchange.
When checking the deposit info you can see that they probably have an account @ mayzusfs, due to the "Details of Payment: 	FFC ACC.9311.234.." information which my guess is their account number @ mayzus.
The deposit information for computekmerchant only contains the btc-e account ID. So this one is pretty close to the actual owners id guess. Maybe they are the owners of btc-e.
Goodluck to you all getting your money back when its either seized by law enforcement or when the website magically disappears! And you can downvote all you want, your loss not mine &gt;_&lt;

I think some people still believe people are actually mining at home, on dial-up, while the reality is that 99+% is mining in pools. And do these pools really have slower than 100mbit/s connections? Most connections in asia are already 1gbit/s @ home. Let alone in a datacenter where even here in europe most providers have 10+ gbit/sec backbones. Bandwidth doesnt cost anything in most civilized nations. The only thing we need to be carefull of is the storage. But for that pruning and new incentives should be presented. (wallets should combine small inputs to larger outputs..the price of a transaction should not be the size of transaction but the actual required storage to maintain the balances)

If they used bitcoin now, bitcoin would be dead.
In 2012 we had worldwide 364,358,000,000 transactions.
This translates to 364,358,000,000 / 31,536,000 = 11.5 thousand transactions per second.
Even if we only used bitcoin for 1‰ of the transactions, the system would be overloaded instantly.
