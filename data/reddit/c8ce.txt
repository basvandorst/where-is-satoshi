It's also dated '31 March 2016'. The FT, and any media outlet which does April Fools jokes, generally manage to not screw up *that* part.

Wasn't it widely rumored that after the GMX account got hacked, that the hacker also got Vistomail and sold it? If Wright wants to deny it, he knows what he needs to do, and it's not a dodgy email.

When was he employed by the FBI as a regular employee and not a contractor or consultant? He was a partner in a computer forensics business.

That's not what Perling claims happened, and shows you didn't even bother to read his version of events but are just contributing to the Reddit echo chamber, gj.
What Perling *actually* says is happening is that he struck up a conversation with some Aussie at the conference while standing around, and after a long conversation explaining the ideas of Bitcoin, he was deeply impressed and as it wound up, asked the dude's name and contact info; who told him he'd be using a Japanese pseudonym in the future, 'Satoshi Nakamoto', which Perling found as weird as it sounds.

It matters because it shows that TaleRecursion is talking out of his ass, and it takes all of the improbability out of it. Satoshi introducing himself as Satoshi is absurd. Satoshi giving a pseudonym after a long talk with a fellow believer who appreciates his work is not absurd.
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:00:54
So the slides never mention Satoshi?
@_date: 2016-05-06 03:16:47
I hope this doesn't end up with Wright murdering a little girl. That would make this all a lot less funny.

I'm not sure how factual you're trying to be, but the wife stuff is wrong. Ramona Watts is Singaporean, not Japanese (nor does she look it). If Andresen and Wright ever corresponded about his wife, it would've been about Lynn Wright, and they had divorced by the time Satoshi left development, so it would be impolite to ask, is a painful topic for Wright (who deleted mentions of her off his blog afterwards), and he certainly would not respond like that. The first signature verification also failed, according to Gavin's Wired interview, because they left off 'CSW', and doubtless caused Wright a great deal of stress.


He used Electrum.
Cool ending though. And don't forget what happened to Romulus...

Yeah, this reads like someone feeding what they already think. Take some speculation that Wright has been scamming everyone by soliciting investment based on a fake trust, use the FT article rumor about how Wright will be announcing things to assure everyone that 'you'll know soon', add some Internet references, and assure everyone that it's based on 'sources'.
Even now, with Wright's failed coming out, there's *still* not a single person who has admitted to giving him money for shares of his trust or to invest in his companies. Don't you think Gavin, at least, would be furious and has enough money to disregard a NDA and expose Wright's criminal fraud as a defense? Well done, OP...? At what point does one conclude that Wright is not running a generic advanced fee scam but it was all the R&amp;D tax credit scam?

She is a notorious libertard flake, for those who don't know her.
If you read through all her old tweets, it sounds like she had the hots for Wright but he shut her down because he already has a wife who isn't nutso and now she's furious.
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:55:48
If it's fanfiction, they've done their homework researching Wright. Not many people know about his interest in Napster or anger about Liberty Dollar's failure.

Who said the trust had anything to do with multisig? He probably just printed out the private keys to paper wallets and stored it with the Panama lawyers that way.

No, they said no one downloaded a *signature* of Electrum from what they claimed was Central London. This could mean either their geolocation is not perfect, the hotel was not in that particular geographic cell, any sort of proxy like a hotel proxy was involved, or Gavin didn't download a signature to check the downloaded executable. Further, since Electrum servers are distributed and there are scores of them, it would be near-impossible to say something like 'X did not use Electrum on a particular date' (not that it would be desirable for the Electrum project to be able to know this, nor is it even necessary for a client to contact Electrum servers just to check a signature).


Why be sloppy with the details?
@_date: 2016-05-13 02:48:24
Dude, are you kidding? I thought you were the author, but guess not. Why would Craig hint to Gavin that he killed Kleiman? The author couldn't have been more obvious about what the twist ending if he had written a summary at the end in 20 point font "BY THE WAY, THE IRONIC TWIST IS THAT WRIGHT MAY HAVE KILLED KLEIMAN AND USURPED HIS KEYS AND CREDIT AND IS A VILLAIN RATHER THAN HERO".














(Note that the Gawker article mentioned Kleiman's mysteriously impoverished death, the handgun and fired shell, and that a lot of the conspiracy theories here on are that Wright was really stealing credit from Kleiman, certain that Kleiman could no longer debunk his claim. Since he's dead.)

Westwood had nothing to do with the R&amp;D tax credits. Think a little bit about the timing here: how could Wright fulminating against Westwood in 2011 documents have anything to do with ATO problems in 2014 and on?

I think this is part of a deliberate PR strategy to dripfeed out the revelations. Each day bring 1 or 2 new things. 2 days ago was the NDA'd media articles &amp; Gavin. Yesterday was the promise. Today was alpaca sock guy's day. So maybe tomorrow will be a coin movement or signature.
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:43:21
That's talking about the number of trustees, I think. And that's a draft agreement, remember.
@_date: 2016-05-06 03:09:58
Wasn't that released in December?
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:38:28
Nguyen, at least, is involved: she was a Wright employee for a while as far as we can tell, and aside from the supposed Tulip Trust, is director or shareholder in at least two of his companies. She may not be the primary target, but if this is all tax fraud, she's got a lot of mud on her because she's benefitted, has fiduciary responsibilities, and signed off on false financial statements &amp; filings.
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:18:40
Assange doesn't know anything. He's disliked Wright since the 1990s, that is all.

Isn't that the usual point of a trust? Put assets into a trust for your kids so they can't blow it on booze and cars; put assets into a trust so your creditors can't go after it; put assets into a trust so your golddigging wife can't claim it in a divorce; put assets into a blind trust so you can't be accused of conflicts of interest; put assets into a trust so Medicare can't go after it when you get pushed into a nursing home...
@_date: 2016-05-06 03:44:36
And your source for him signing the IP assignment contracts is? I wouldn't be surprised if he did contract or consult with the FBI as they are a major consumer of forensics services, but I don't see why they would demand such a thing of anyone but a fulltime normal employee, which no one has said Kleiman was for them.
