Always good news to see another company accepting it. According to [this,]( there is 1,538 websites running UltraCart, that could potentially start accepting bitcoin if they wanted. :p
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:26:50
I don't know that i'd say it's a direct confirmation they are incorporating it 100%. However, it is fairly significant, and they are thinking about it at some level. Interesting for sure.
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:52:45
So this means if you use CoinKite as a wallet, when you withdraw they take 1% of your withdrawal? I'm not being negative, that seems perfectly reasonable, I'm just making sure I understand. ☺:)
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:17:14
Great, thanks!
@_date: 2013-09-23 06:24:34
I've used Bitonic, great service. You pay a bit of a premium (obviously) but the service is fast and easy. :)
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:40:00
I like the video, and am happy to see it was made possible by a great site, that I have used multiple times. :) (Bitonic)
@_date: 2013-09-10 23:50:38
Wow, thanks man!
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:34:16
Can't wait to watch the documentary. Will be a great way to expose family/friends to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-17 07:26:21
I buy it every time as well, and there is a lot of great games. So many in fact, that I never get around to playing them. :P
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:47:15
I like bit-card.de, they look cool. :)

I thought the Hurt Locker was a really good movie.
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:57:39
Actually, Spare Rib Express only seems to accept cash and pin at home. All other places seem to accept all payments, seems odd.
Maybe thuisbezorgd doesn't handle their payments, but they still get on the website.
@_date: 2013-09-13 07:13:01
Absolutely agree, is a stand-up guy. I'm glad that aside from a few spammers and trolls,  is a fairly friendly place. :)
@_date: 2013-09-28 18:28:11
Oh indeed! Don't get me wrong, I wasn't pointing this out as a criticism to
Bitcoin or anything, I was just curious if it was possible.
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:06:05
Yes indeed. :) 
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:29:44
Great! I've been waiting for this. :)
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:52:08
I don't know of any others off hand, but maybe if you contact the people at All4Btc they may be able to set up something where it's shipped to them and then they ship it to you? Maybe worth a try.
@_date: 2013-10-12 22:34:45
I'm doing some work for bitcoin, and I only cash out small amounts of fiat when I need to. For the large majority (90%+) of it, I keep it in bitcoin, and just spend the bitcoins whenever possible. I can't wait for the day when I don't even need to think about fiat anymore.

I'm 19, and will be starting university for computer science next year. :)
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:32:23
Oh wow I didn't notice that, that is pretty sweet then. I'll definitely pick some up!
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:51:40
No, not really. While Coinbase themselves will most likely not steal your coins, it is possible they could get hacked, or that their website gets taken offline for some reason. You should always have the majority of your funds in a wallet you personally control. Ideally, for any sum you cannot afford to lose, an offline, or paper wallet would be best.
@_date: 2013-10-08 06:38:11
I signed up, am I supposed to get an email right away, or is it a waiting list? Seems like an awesome service.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:02:08
If you have a good password and 2FA, your account is quite safe from someone hacking your individual account, I believe. The concern then would come from whether Coinbase as a whole is a scam, and runs off with your money, (unlikely) or if someone compromises all of Coinbase, and gets access to the wallets. (unlikely, but still possible, and they are a target). Coinbase does only keep 10% of its funds in a hot wallet, and the rest are in cold storage, and should be untouchable.
Nothing is as safe as an offline wallet however. I personally keep around 1 BTC in an online wallet for easy access, and the rest in offline storage.
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:56:16
Well, if you've used the app successfully since you changed your PW, it may not be that. However, you could always try changing your PW back to what it was and try. It sounds exactly like the problem I had, and I don't believe they've fixed it. :)
@_date: 2013-09-17 07:05:20
Any plans on support for the Netherlands? :D
We have dominos here!
@_date: 2013-08-26 12:42:15
Their fee is 5%. :)

Awesome work. (haha emma nice)

The Bitcoin Perspective
@_date: 2013-10-20 20:52:52
Bitonic is a great site, i've used it multiple times. You pay a bit of a premium for the convenience and speed, but I really like it.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:55:58
It only took him two minutes to reply to my email hah. I believe it is actually from the creator, [John]( 
He also went on to say that he marked my ticket as "bitcoin" and he'd let me know when/if they start accepting it. :)
@_date: 2013-10-08 08:22:08
Ok great! Can't wait to try it.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:24:03
I believe you mean bitcoin mixing? Check this page out. :) 
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:14:10
Nice stuff man, i'll take a look later on. :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 10:57:49
You're not wrong, but there is friendlier ways you could put that.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:31:44
Yes, this is something we totally need. I've been waiting for a Bitmit replacement. :) Being the first one into this area again is a big advantage, use it!
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:18:41
Does anyone know who it was at the end who said the thing about instantly recognizing it as one of the most important inventions?
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:19:39
It's a bot that let's you tip people on reddit with bitcoin! :) Check out for more info.

The bitcoin community never ceases to amaze me. This is incredible. Awesome news!

My parents travelled alot, so I was homeschooled from kindergarten to grade 12, because it was the best way I could get a steady education. I loved it, and while one of "downfalls" of homeschooling is lack of social interaction at school, most homeschoolers I know do their best to take their kids to plenty of social activities, and often meetup with other homeschoolers. It's hardly a large issue to solve.
I had DVD school after grade 6, so I had plenty of different teachers, plus my parents. In my situation, I've visited more countries than alot of people will ever get to, and that is some of the best school you can ever get in my opinion. I've met a lot of people over my (19) years, and I have yet to meet a homeschooled individual who is more stunted socially than anyone else in the world.
Anyhow, my 2 satoshis. :)
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:13:22
Hah, I got a laugh out of this, thanks for posting! Every time they say internet, change it to bitcoin in your head, and it sounds very familiar to recent newscasts. :D
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:16:15
I have bought a book from amazon from them, and I got it. For what it's worth.
@_date: 2013-09-11 21:44:06
I'm quite fond of Apple products in general, but I too will be purchasing an android device (tablet or phone), just because of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 13:15:52
I don't play League of Legends very much anymore, simply due to time, but I still watch streams and the LCS. If Twitch.TV had an option to donate bitcoin, I could see it really catching on. It's a good demographic for it too.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:53:05
Whooo! I've been waiting for this day to come! I sent them an email a while ago. This is great news!

All4Btc.com is what you're looking for. :) I've used them several times and can vouch for their service.
@_date: 2013-10-10 06:57:15
I'd love to get one of these, however I just can't bring myself to spend $38 shipping (to Europe) on an $18 candle. :(
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:56:24
I live in Holland, and It sounds like a Dutch accent. Since this was sponsored by a Dutch site, it's highly likely.

Wow, the lady was really pushing it with that question about how many Bitcoin he holds...that's a bit personal lol.

All free photoshop alternatives, as good as some may be, are still not on the same level as photoshop.

Your best bet is trying to contact those websites and hoping they accept whatever proof you can send them. Good luck! :)

I've also used this multiple times, great service. :)

Interesting, how do you go about displaying a QR code on the nano? Do those nanos allow pictures, or was it some creative hack?
@_date: 2013-10-21 07:38:29
I think what Beccy and Austin are doing is great. 
Some people seem to be against it, but they're not looking at the big picture. Documentaries like this are great to show to your families. 
My family at least, is a sucker for 'reality' TV, so they'd watch something like this no problem. Anything that exposes more of the general population to bitcoin is a good thing!
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:24:21
I feel sad for the Chinese people. However, what makes bitcoin an amazing invention has not changed, and cryptocurrencies (whether it be Bitcoin or not) are not going anywhere.

This is actually pretty nifty, and the battery life on these things is apparently quite good. I can't find one for 20~ bucks like he did though :p
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:03:41
Yea, it will take quite a while if you do not include a fee, but it will go through eventually. Hang in there!
@_date: 2013-09-24 06:31:16
It's probably not as simple as that. I haven't looked anything up, but just because they "own" it, doesn't (necessarily) mean they have direct control over the payment methods.
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:00:08
The ad is light-hearted, fun, and designed to get people interested in bitcoin. Which it has successfully done. I do not think it takes away any legitimacy whatsoever.
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:07:52
Did you change your password on the Blockchain.info website anytime recently? 
If you change your password on the website, the app will no longer function. Currently, the only way I know of to get the app working again is to change your password back to what it was before you changed it. 
I know this, because I changed my password on the website a little while ago, and it took me a while to figure out why it kept giving me a wallet decrypting error.
@_date: 2013-09-28 14:24:05
Thanks! Somehow I must have never read the wiki FAQ on mining. :o
@_date: 2013-11-12 10:54:25

This is funny and all, but there has already been numerous posts about it. I think we need to start encouraging people to search before just posting, there is an unreasonable amount of duplicate stories.

Now i'm learning Python, and wish I had started sooner :P what resources did you use to learn?
I've done numerous design projects for bitcoin, and bought into a couple stocks on BTCT. I've really learned a lot of good general "life stuff" just by using bitcoin.

Why do people say "don't upvote" ? Seems to me that a good question should be upvoted so more people can see it. No shame in questions.

Most of the time:

I don't know which you're looking for, but it's a common misconception hah.
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:39:40
Is there something I do not understand though? Even if you do not get that many payments with it, with Bitcoin you can accept it virtually free, so why not?? Every little bit counts.
@_date: 2013-11-03 09:10:56
It is a good service and all, but it isn't "new", it even says in the article it started in early 2013.

I agree that it isn't ready for public consumption just yet, but to say "it may never be" seems quite ignorant to me. These things take time, and look how far we've come in what, under 3 years? The future is bright.
