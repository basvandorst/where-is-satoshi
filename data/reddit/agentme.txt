Segwit was required, which was set up so miners needed to signal support for, but Segwit has already been locked in so that's no longer an issue since several months ago. (Unless you want to use LN with Bcash ... lol.)

Most billionaires have their money tied up in investments and banks where transactions are both traceable and reversible. If more billionaires kept their wealth in easily accessible cash or cryptocurrency that can be permanently stolen easily, then it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect that attacks on billionaires would become more common.

I think people will set their nodes' fees while wanting it to be competitive with regular bitcoin transaction fees (if the fees for using a lightning node are greater than a regular transaction, then people may just do a regular transaction instead) and with credit card fees. I've seen other people suggest that sub-percentage fees would likely become popular for these reasons.

The trezor wallet software does by default.
The Bitcoin Core client does if you use some debug command, but you have to do it for each address including change addresses which is annoying and easy to mess up so I wouldn't recommend this.
I assumed Electrum did, but I looked it up now and apparently they mostly skipped P2SH segwit support and don't expose it as an easy option. It seems like a really strange decision to me. I don't have any other suggestions.

Ohh, you're talking about bech32 addresses. They've sometimes been called "native" segwit addresses. Those are still really new and not much software supports them yet.
Normal segwit addresses (or "P2SH" segwit addresses) begin with a "3" and pretty much all bitcoin software supports sending to them. P2SH segwit addresses still get the segwit benefits of cheaper transactions.

Yeah I'm scratching my head at all the posts assuming that getting in years ago means you have a lot. Plenty of people thought the tech was cool, picked up some scrappy amounts just to use it, and thought it was silly at the time to put serious money into it or to try to play the market. And there's plenty of amounts where a 4x difference in returns is the difference between a nice savings boost and a lifestyle-changer.
Granted, I'm not sure bcash had much appeal to anyone in it for the tech.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:24:03
Yes, but you can't share that fully-pruned version with someone else and expect them to trust it. But with segwit, the signatures aren't a critical part of the blockchain, and someone can sync the blockchain with only the signatures for the last few blocks and trust the proof-of-work across it. The signatures aren't necessary to verify the hash of the rest of the blockchain.

Some wallet software gives you the option of using segwit addresses or not. The only reason to ever choose "no" is if you're also using your device or seed with wallet software that doesn't support segwit addresses. (It doesn't matter whether the people you're receiving from or sending to support segwit or not.)
The benefit of picking a segwit address is that transactions sent from a segwit address have a smaller transaction fee.

You do get native versions of all the games and all future updates too!
The in-browser stuff is a really neat idea: the games aren't bound to a specific platform, so they're not going to be outdated with future OS and processor changes. And you get easy cross-platform gamesave syncing (Steam syncs the saves for some games, but for some it only does it for computers on the same OS, which completely misses the point for people who have different kinds of computers).
It is a bit of a half-assed tech demo though: You can't bookmark any of the games to browse directly to them for one thing. A few of the games spazz out and zoom into a corner half the time when I fullscreen them. Most of the games use Escape to open their menu, which also triggers fullscreen mode to be exited (seriously wtf who tested this. This isn't like a weird edge case ffs. Who in their right mind would put all this effort in to get games on the web and then half-ass the last mile like this?). FTL's crew name text inputs just don't work.

 The murder charges appeared to be a bullshit charade that both DPR and the "victim" knew. The transcripts are available online somewhere.
Some guy anonymously messages DPR, telling DPR that he found an exploit in the Silk Road, stole some information on a lot of big-time sellers, and was going to release it if DPR didn't pay him some large amount of money. DPR flat-out rejects the offer. The guy then said he owed money to a dealer that he re-sold drugs to, explains that if DPR could settle his debts with the dealer then he'd be happy, and then he gave DPR that dealer's (anonymous) contact info.
If you're anonymously trying to blackmail someone, why on earth would you tell your target the contact information of a third party who knows where you live AND who shares a motive against you? The story as-is is barely believable.
The "dealer" then offers to solve the problem of the blackmailer for DPR, and asks for an amount of money, suspiciously a little lower than the amount the blackmailer wanted. DPR pays him, and no longer worries about his customer data seller being leaked.
There's no evidence that the "dealer"/assassin was a real person, or that any murder ever occurred. The dealer and the blackmailer only ever anonymously communicated with DPR, and no one else. The blackmailer introduced the dealer/assassin to DPR unprompted. No one besides each other knew who they were. It seems likely they're the same person. The whole thing appears to be a weird charade for the blackmailer to barter with DPR down a price to not leak the data.

I agree, but I think the remaining big points about it significantly being not like Bitcoin aren't known enough. From your first link:






The revolutionary part about Bitcoin was that it was the first trust-less digital payment system. E-cash systems requiring trust already existed long before Bitcoin, and weren't all that special. It sounds like Ripple is an interesting take on the latter; it has little to do with what's important about Bitcoin though. I think it's being marketed (maybe just by the users) misleadingly.

If Alice is compromised and only has an encrypted wallet, then it will be all stolen when she enters the password to use it later.
If Bob is compromised and has a canary and an encrypted wallet, he'll immediately see that the $10 he kept in the canary was transferred out, and he'll reformat his computer (while keeping the backups of important non-executable stuff like the encrypted wallet) instead of entering his encrypted wallet's password onto it.

The cheaper bitcoins are, the less protection the network has. The less protection the network has, the cheaper it is for someone to do a 51% attack and subvert or break the network.
If someone could stand to profit from a 51% attack more than what it would cost to do a 51% attack, then the system would be critically vulnerable. Therefore, the cost of a 51% attack should be viewed as a sort of upper bound of how much value the Bitcoin network can safely handle.

Mining is creating proof-of-works which is the process of voting. When a proof-of-work of high enough difficulty is completed, then the voting round is won, and the winner is rewarded with newly minted credits and any of the included new transaction fees.

Yeah, the groundbreaking thing about bitcoin **was not** that it's digital money. Ways to implement digital money systems were immediately obvious to everyone when asymmetric cryptography was invented, but all of those systems were centralized and required a trusted bank which could abuse the system. This linked paper here doesn't describe anything novel that hasn't been done plenty of times. Bitcoin was revolutionary because it showed you could have a **decentralized** digital cash system without any trusted authorities. Furthermore, Bitcoin completely rejected many academic techniques (some described here) such as blind signatures which were built around central authorities.

@_date: 2014-01-27 11:47:32
Here's a summary of the Bitcoin whitepaper and the ideas behind it without getting technical.
Asymmetric cryptography allows people to sign messages with a digital signature. Anyone can look at a signed message and verify that the signature could only have been generated by the person who signed it. No one can fake a digital signature from someone else (unless they steal the key from the user's computer, [beat the key out of the user]( etc). A signature is only valid for the exact version of the message; if someone takes a copy of the signed message and changes the message, then the signature is obviously invalid for that message.
With digital signatures, you can imagine the basis of a decentralized value transfer / ownership tracking system. If everyone agrees that I have one credit, then I can sign a message saying "I give my one credit to Bob", and send that signed message to Bob. Bob can then show other people the signed message I sent him to show that I've signed away my one credit to him. If Bob wants to pay someone, he can sign a message "I give my one credit to Alice", and send both that message and the message I originally sent to Bob to show the valid movement of the credit from me to ultimately her. Everyone agreed I had that credit to start with, so anyone can verify that chain of messages describing the movement of the credit as valid.
However, you run into the double-spending problem now. I can sign a second message that says "I give my one credit to Charlie" and send that signed message to Charlie after I sent the earlier message to Bob. If Bob (or Alice later) compares notes with Charlie, they'll have an awkward situation. Anyone can easily duplicate credits.
The first step Bitcoin takes to combat this is that all transactions are broadcasted publicly. When I sign the message "I give my one credit to Bob", I don't just send that signed message to Bob, but instead I make it public and tell it to everyone I know, and they tell everyone they know, etc. Now if I try to double-spend my credits to Charlie later, everyone will know that I sent my one credit to Bob already, and no one will even pay attention to or relay my attempted double-spent payment message to Charlie. (There are privacy issues to this, though Bitcoin is pseudonymous which helps a lot. You use addresses instead of names in the publicly broadcast transactions, and everyone can have as many different addresses as they want.)
What if I publish the messages "I give my one credit to Bob" and "I give my one credit to Charlie" at the same time? Bob will want to insist that the message giving it to him is the valid one and that the transfer to Charlie is invalid, and Charlie will insist the other way.
*(Aside: You might imagine you could try to get everyone to ignore both messages when conflicting messages are published at the same time like that, but there's issues with that. Anyone could reverse a payment to someone by waiting a short amount of time and then announcing a conflicting payment. How do you choose how much time it takes to solidify? And what if I tell half of everyone I know about my transfer attempt to Bob and half of everyone I know about my transfer attempt to Charlie a short while later, and no one can agree on exactly how much time passed in-between those messages?)*
Ultimately, one of these conflicting messages has to be agreed on by everyone as the valid message, and everything that conflicts with it is thrown out.
If everyone trusted a single timestamping service that always enforced an order between events (never timestamping two things at the same moment), then everyone could submit their signed payment messages to the timestamping service, and then everyone would always agree that in case of conflicts, they would always check to see which message the timestamping service said came first.
But who could you trust to run the central timestamping service? If a friend of Charlie's ran it, then Charlie could convince them (or try to force them) to say that the transfer to Charlie was the one that came first. Or what happens if the timestamping service shuts down one day? The government might decide that the central service counts as an unlicensed money transmitter and easily force them to stop. Or what if Charlie really hates red-haired people and convinces the timestamping service to outright deny their transactions or only timestamp transactions from them if they pay him a fee? With this system, you're trusting the central timestamping service to run the system. Is there a decentralized and more democratic solution where you don't have to trust a single group like this?
*(Aside: If you decide that trusting a central service is allowable, then relying on a timestamping service is not the only choice, and probably is a suboptimal one. Instead, everyone could rely on a central service who just tells you whether the transaction conflicts with anything in the past sent to the service or not, and you don't have to do the publicly-broadcast-all-transactions thing. This specific model can be extended so that payments can still be verified when the senders are anonymous even to the central entity by using a method called blind signatures, but the system still suffers from the issues above about relying on central entities. This system is referred to as a Chaumian digital currency system.)*
This is equivalent to the Byzantine Generals' Problem, and Bitcoin's novel solution to this in the context of peer-to-peer applications is where Bitcoin truly innovates.
You could have everyone vote (say every ten minutes) on a message that contains all of the properly signed transactions that they're choosing to honor. Every round of voting always chooses to start out with the transactions decided on in the most recent vote. This forms a chain of voting rounds. People believe in the legitimacy of this chain of voting rounds based on the sum of all of the votes across all of the chain's previous rounds. Every person voting in this round knows the results of the most recent vote, has been personally watching all new transaction messages, ignoring all of the new transactions that conflict with a new transaction they saw come beforehand, and every round they vote for the message containing all of the new transactions they personally believe should be valid based on the order they saw them. *(Aside: The vote isn't a majority-wins system, but is actually a lottery where each candidate message of new transactions to incorporate has a chance to win directly proportional to the number of votes it got. This means that it's fine if everyone is voting on slightly different payment sets to include (which is exactly what happens for reasons that are mentioned later). This eliminates the chance of a vote split between many similar choices allowing a small colluding group to easily vote in a fringe candidate. And if a suboptimal candidate wins a round, it's no big issue at all because double-spend attempts are rare (because everyone knows they don't work long-term), no one really trusts payments until they've been voted in for a few rounds anyway, and any missed non-conflicting payments are very likely to be part of the winning candidate message next round. The true value in voting is less about resolving rare double-spend conflicts, but more about adding to the legitimacy of the chain of voting rounds, which cements the history of the system and prevents transactions from being switched for double-spends much later.)* After a round of voting ends, everyone forgets the order they personally saw the last round of new transactions come in as, and defers to the results of the vote as to what transactions they trust.
Now whenever someone receives a payment, they wait for a few rounds of voting (aka. confirmations) to pass before they trust that the payment is unlikely to ever be disagreed with in the future. Essentially, this system of voting rounds is a distributed timestamping service that quickly increases its confidence over successive rounds that everyone can agree on.
But how do you do this over the Internet? Anyone could pretend to be a bunch of people (either by using lots of network connections, or by claiming to be relaying many people's votes) and vote any number of times. *Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system as votes.* Your number of votes are based on how much computing power you decide to use for voting. Anyone can verify how much computing power your votes had put into them. It's not possible to fake.
There's two problems left: the initial distribution of credits, and the point of voting. If there are no central entities, then where are credits minted to begin with? How does everyone agree who should start out with credits? And why would people bother to spend processor time voting, besides when they're receiving a transaction? If almost no one is voting, then anyone with a lot of processor power can come in at any time and overwhelm the votes to fully control what transactions are counted as valid each round. (If their number of votes is greater than the number of votes of the previous round, then they could even decide to ignore a number of previous rounds, host their own replacement voting rounds that throw out previously agreed-upon transactions, and claim that their chain of voting rounds are more legitimate because it has more votes across it. Everyone participates in the chain with the most votes across all of its past voting rounds, and knows everyone else follows this same rule, so everyone who wants their votes to matter will have no choice but to switch to the attacker's chain of voting rounds and history if the attacker invents their own chain with enough votes faster than any other chain. This is the so-called 51% attack.) It is essential for maintaining the consistency of the history of the system for there to be many voters voting regularly with processor power.
Bitcoin solves both of these problems with one move: voting mints credits and claims the included transaction fees. People who send transactions can choose to include a little extra as a fee which goes where the winning voter decides for it along with a predetermined amount of new credits. (The rate of credit minting is predetermined and decreases over time eventually to zero in order to enforce scarcity. Transactions without fees might get ignored by a lot of voters and therefore take longer to show up in a winning entry.) You're rewarded for showing up with your processor time to vote. The creation of new credits and the distribution of transaction fees is spread between the voters who work the hardest to maintain the system.
*(Aside about terminology: In Bitcoin, a completed voting round is called a "block". Every voting round besides the first is dependent on a previous voting round, and this chain is called the "blockchain". Voting using your processor power is called "mining". Voters are "miners". Credits are divisible and called "bitcoins". People who listen for new transactions and relay them to more people (and might not be voting/mining themselves) are often just called "nodes"; this includes everyone who runs the standard Bitcoin-Qt wallet software.)*
That is Bitcoin. There's no single central entity you have to depend on or trust to run it. It's an open source decentralized democratic value tracking and transfer system.

If your system is infected by malware, it can stay invisible until you decrypt your wallet, and then it steals everything. If you have an unencrypted canary wallet, it will most likely steal from that first, and then you'll know not to enter in your main wallet's password on that computer.
The mugger analogy isn't very good. Pretend the muggers are invisible and only take what's in plain sight. If the $20 you have on the front of your jacket disappears into thin air, then you know you shouldn't use or take your wallet out where it can be seen since there are muggers around.

Comparing the present mining rates of different cryptocurrencies is meaningless. They're arbitrary units.


The point of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized, so bringing up a centralized currency like this and praising its centralization just misses the point on several levels.


The rate that bitcoins are minted at renormalizes regularly to the target rate. Bitcoin was built to handle advances in mining power. That was one of its break-throughs.

Then bothering with encryption does nothing but increase the chance you'll lock yourself out. The reason we bother with encryption is because we acknowledge the possibility of an attacker.
The point of the canary is so you would know (not with complete certainty of course) whether it's safe to use that computer to decrypt any encrypted wallets. You'd only keep a few dollars worth in the canary wallet.

By then, increased transaction activity should mean that the miners receive enough fees to continue to make it worthwhile for them.
@_date: 2014-10-24 03:05:56
You can create and sign a transaction without broadcasting it. You can give the transaction to someone else so that they can broadcast it at a later time. You can use the locktime feature to make it so the network will reject the transaction if it's broadcasted before a chosen time. Before they broadcast the transaction, you're free to broadcast your own conflicting transaction that will prevent the other one from ever being usable.

Just to pedantically nitpick, that signature is pretty bad toward being proof that address is yours. It just proves that someone with that address wanted to sign "Hi ghtj80". Someone else could own that address, signed that message, posted the signature somewhere (somewhere else besides this thread I guess, unless you're a secret mod and deleted the original post), and then you pretended to own that address and copied their signed message and signature into a post here. That signed message does not state the owner of the address, so people shouldn't read the signature as verifying anything else.
Of course there's nothing at stake in this specific scenario, I just wanted to take the opportunity to explain more about signatures. If you're ever signing an important message, it's important that the message is very specific and doesn't rely on outside context, because otherwise someone can repeat the signed message in a different context to mislead people.

The sansa clip+ can be reflashed over USB. I'm not sure if its software can block that. If it can't, then it's a bad choice. If it can, then you have to make sure to entirely remove the stock firmware too, because otherwise you can allow it to be compromised by accidentally plugging it into a computer while it's in stock mode.

.onion addresses are for services that want to be hosted anonymously. Trusting an anonymous person to host your web wallet is the epitome of idiocy. You have no possible recourse if they run away with the money.
Not that using a web wallet was a very great move to begin with. Part of the point of Bitcoin is that you don't have to rely on others to store your money for you! Why would you jump through hoops to do it anyway?

This sounds like at best an upcoming Freenet / Gnunet / Tahoe lookalike with shiny marketing promising the world instead of talking about any of the nitty gritty technical stuff -- the marketing video could just as easily describe BitTorrent, Gnutella, Freenet, Gnunet, Tahoe-LAFS, except those actually exist now and are in wide use already -- and vague plans are mentioned to somehow integrate a new altcoin to control access to drive space. (How is it verified in a decentralized manner that the nodes accepting payments will in fact host data? That's the hard part that's glossed over!)
Even if it is just a new take at Freenet type ideas, that would be good to see it maybe done better, but at this point it looks pretty wishy-washy.

Bitcoin isn't about being a more economical choice. Sometimes it works out like that, but that's a side effect. Bitcoin is about being able to control your own money, as opposed to being fully dependent on banks to deal with any of your money.

The effects of the rapidly improving mining equipment causing the difficulty to skyrocket has probably been the dominating factor for a while now, but if those had been held constant, it should be pretty apparent that the bitcoin price changes would directly affect mining profitability, and could push people out when mining became not profitable for them.

It's not a decentralized / trust-less system like Bitcoin. It should be categorized more closely to Paypal than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-15 06:18:46


The point of Bitcoin (and its mining process) is that it works without trust. If you trust people to self regulate, or trust a lawmaking body to run the system, then the mining process and Bitcoin itself is a hilariously suboptimal solution.
Bitcoin requires tons of CPU cycles to be spent on mining, and requires all transactions to be broadcast to everyone. These are major downsides to Bitcoin, but they're worth it to solve the problem of making a trustless decentralized currency. If you're going to make a digital currency / ledger system that presupposes trusted groups, then there are much easier ways to do it than Bitcoin's model! Bitcoin's model does not bring anything new to that table; it only brings large downsides that don't accomplish anything in this case.

ASICs are just chips designed efficiently for mining. If mining becomes profitable enough, then someone will invest in them. And if mining requires a very complicated ASIC, then the development of the ASICs might even be more concentrated than it was for Bitcoin. Litecoin ran into that issue.
Also, if only consumer desktop computers are useful for mining, then mining will be done almost exclusively by botnets. It wouldn't be great publicity, and a big botnet could swoop in and 51% attack the network.

Chaum came up with blind signatures, which allowed for a very strong anonymity system, and came up with designs around central authorities. Bitcoin with its public block record and focus on removing the need for trust is the total antithesis to Chaum's work.

Mtgox had sent me a free yubikey a long time ago, I guess as some sort of random promotional thing. It is (was) tied to my gox account, and it's one of the logo-less versions without any mtgox branding on it, so it's not even an interesting souvenir at this point.
I haven't used gox at all since dwolla stopped dealing with them at least.

When the miner chooses a set of transactions to incorporate in the blockchain, they're allowed to invent a transaction going where they want which controls brand new credits that appear out of thin air, the amount depending on the minting schedule (it started at 50, but it's at 25 now), plus the sum of the set's new transaction fees. If the miner's set of transactions wins the voting round (by completing a proof-of-work of high enough difficulty first, which is a stochastic process), then they get the reward they included.
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:40:04
Note that the percentage is the percentage of the network (that the mycelium server is talking to) that acknowledged the transactions, not exactly the percentage of chance it will be in the next block. There's a slight difference. Even if all the nodes the mycelium server talks to acknowledge the transaction, a miner the server isn't talking to still might have acknowledged a conflicting transaction already. Or hell, a miner talking to the mycelium server might say it acknowledged the transaction, but mine a different one in the next block anyway.
Not that I disagree with the feature, I'm actually a big fan of this being more widely implemented.
Zero confirmation transactions still have risks, but a feature like this can let you know sooner when people try to act maliciously. There are many situations where zeroconf transactions are fine. If someone is renting something (like a room or server), then the provider can accept the zeroconf payment immediately, and then take back the rented item if the transaction fails to confirm because of a doublespend. A website selling products to be shipped doesn't need to have the buyer stick around on a "wait for the payment to confirm" screen; the seller can let the buyer finish checking out, and then make sure the payment has confirmed before shipping the item later that day.

Ugh, but I already abbreviate "Bitcoin" to "bits" internally in my head all the time, including referring to mBTC as "em-bits".

Pools don't exactly differ much in significant ways.
@_date: 2014-09-27 23:15:25
Agreed. If one reads the [original bitcoin paper]( they'll see that block time is not a factor in the main calculations about the security of confirmations.
Shorter block times do have some negatives (higher chance of blockchain forks which means that miners waste more time not helping secure the network, and miners with faster connections get more of an advantage over miners with slower connections because they waste less time on outdated blocks), but the security of confirmations certainly does not scale linearly with the block target time.
Anyway, it's overkill to wait for even a single confirmation for most small transactions. You can wait a few seconds to see if a double-spend starts trying to spread across the network. And in many situations where people pay with BTC, like subscribing to a service, or ordering something to be shipped to them, there's no need to make the customer wait around staring at a screen telling them to wait for confirmation. If a double-spend happens and the transaction fails, then the seller can cut off the user's subscription or stop preparing to ship the item, and then contact the customer.

* A country could decide to use Bitcoin as their main currency. This would save them from going through the effort of needing to make their own currency, and would make trade with other existing bitcoiners easy. They wouldn't be able to influence their economy through monetary policy and printing it though.
* If you mean create a new colored coin or altcoin, that's just dumb. The entire point of Bitcoin is that it can be used between two people without any trust and without any trusted third parties. **Digital currencies existed before Bitcoin. The revolutionary part of Bitcoin is not that it's "digital".** Why would a government be worried about creating a currency that doesn't require people to trust itself? A government could create a digital currency where they were a trusted third party. They would be able to print more of it as needed or to influence the economy, etc.

Mining has high up-front costs that might not be made up for by many at this point. People who are already mining and have paid off these costs can easily profit.
If many people stop mining, then mining will become more profitable for everyone else, likely causing more people to start mining. It's a self stabilizing equilibrium.

Malware could also encrypt all of its connections, or upload users' private keys steganographically inside normal-looking connections. And/or it could only trigger for a random subset of users. For someone to assume or declare something is safe just because they might not see it doing anything bad in testing is idiotic.
People shouldn't trust declarations from others that something is safe without thinking about it themselves either. Those stamps of approval could come from the malware authors too.
Using a closed-source bitcoin-related program within the same trust region (user account, sandbox, whatever) as a bitcoin wallet is an especially bad idea. Especially when that program comes directly from a group that just admitted to hacking a bitcoin exchange ffs.

LTC's 4x faster block time means you have four 1mb blocks of transactions in the time that BTC has one. With increased Segwit adoption, LTC could have 2mb blocks, making its current on-chain limits roughly equal to BCH (though with the benefits of better-prunable transactions thanks to Segwit, with transactions able to avoid the transaction malleability issue, and with faster confirmation times).

Additionally, the covert ASICBOOST trick encourages miners to drop transactions or even make empty blocks often. It's a flaw of Bitcoin's incentive structure to incentivize miners to avoid including transactions.

It's not the type of thing we want to be the new way for everyone to mine.

Roger Ver pushed for a block size upgrade and switched to vocally supporting Bitcoin Cash (which has ~~2mb~~ 8mb max block size, and which committed to not supporting the Segwit improvements) when it came out.
Bitcoin has since activated the Segwit improvements, which allows for blocks larger than 1mb (in a more efficient way than just upping the limit, and fixes the transaction malleability issue, allowing more advanced types of transactions in the future). Roger Ver's Bitcoin mining pool does not appear to support mining blocks with Segwit transactions, therefore it only mines blocks with a max size of 1mb, which is ironic given that he has been such a vocal supporter of 1mb+ blocks. The irony casts doubt on his stated reasons for supporting Bitcoin Cash to begin with.

Newer clients won't accept blocks that break the newly-tightened rules, most miners know that and ignore the new-rule-breaking blocks because they don't want to waste work on something a lot of the network won't immediately recognize, and so chain that follow the newly-tightened rules will end up being the longest as long as most miners are on board.
So if someone today mined a block that didn't follow the new rules, old clients might see it briefly, but the rest of the miners are going to keep working based off of the previous block, they'll make the blockchain exclude that new-rule-breaking block, and old clients will switch to their longer blockchain.

Trezor and Trezor 2 are both "source available". You can see the source code and make modifications to it, but you can't use the code in your own product that you sell for example.


A secure element rules out certain types of attacks. (Someone who intercepted your trezor shipment before you got it could flash firmware onto it that looks normal but leaks your keys. It would be hard but they might even be able to make the backdoor survive some firmware updates. A secure element can help defend against this type of attack. Trezor does provide some small defenses against this kind of attack by making their packages tamper-evident at least.) It's possible that a secure element also makes it harder to physically dissect the chip to extract keys, but nobody has demonstrated that against trezor yet, so personally I'm not terribly worried about that.
EDIT: Trezor has a bootloader which warns on startup when an unsigned firmware is used, so Trezor should be protected against the backdoored-firmware attacked I described. I'm actually not super sure then if the security element brings benefits other than theoretically making physical dissection harder.

But the chain doesn't split into two long-running chains, instead the rule-breaking block just becomes orphaned and forgotten about: the blockchain following the new rules becomes longer, and the old clients and old miners switch to the longer chain that happens to be following the new rules. I just wanted to emphasize to others that segwit does not (directly) ever cause splits/forks like bch, bitcoin gold, s2x, etc, as long as a majority of the miners are following the new segwit rules.

Then you would need some password to retrieve the wallet.dat, which you need for the encryption keys to your bitcoins. [According to this page]( it seems like it's possible to directly use a password (instead of private keys in the wallet.dat) to control bitcoins. The desktop client could maybe be changed so you only used a single password to control your bitcoins, rather than a wallet.dat file. Of course this would lower the bar for anyone trying to steal them since they would now only need a bruteforceable password.

Bitcoin websites aren't being hacked because bored miners are using their machines to crack passwords.

There is a public blockchain that all transactions are pseudonymously recorded in. When Alice gives Bob 1 bitcoin, Alice uploads the transaction of 1 bitcoin going from an address she controls to an address that Bob controls, and this transaction gets saved in the blockchain.

UPnP doesn't let people remotely open ports into your NAT. It lets programs already running on your computer open incoming ports to that computer. Disabling it makes your computer a little harder to use for any hacker or virus already in it, but having it enabled isn't going to let viruses in any easier than having it off.

I believe there were discussions about doing this, but I never saw anything come of these. Also, what would miners gain from mining this shared distributed thing? Everything on it? BTC+NMC+... possibly a dozen other things too. (Or maybe some sort of shared thing that can be used as bitcoin or NMC? Not really a good idea as the different systems can work differently; NMC gets used up and simply disappears when domains are purchased for example.)

People always say this because a virus could possibly use UPnP to open a port and let other bots communicate to you, but the virus could just as easily open outbound connections to communicate with other bots. Turning off UPnP for this reason is like keeping your front door boarded over so you can't even open it from the inside, just to stop any possible robbers from having an easy path out.

It's much harder for them to try to sneak a new backdoor into the github version without anyone noticing. At brainwallet.org, they could host a backdoored version to a random 1% of visitors. On github, they have to host the same version to everyone. They could do that for a while and then revert the change, but anyone who had cloned the repository during that time would have a permanent record of that. That's riskier for an attacker to try to get away with.
There's still risk at both if you're not reviewing all the code yourself, but blindly relying on the github repo is a bit safer than blindly relying on the brainwallet.org site.

Point three is just barely skimming the surface of the possibilities. You didn't mention many specifics. Is encryption client-side? How do you know to trust other people's keys?

Private keys let you control the bitcoins that are stored at an address. Once the bitcoins are sent to a new address (such as one in your wallet), then the old address and its private keys have no control over those bitcoins.
Imagine a giant excel file where all bitcoin addresses are in one column, and all the balances are in the second column. That's an example of a ledger, which is what the bitcoin blockchain functionally is. You can only send bitcoins from addresses you have the private keys for.

To me, free and open software meant I was no longer strictly dependent and required to trust others for software. I could verify any of the code myself. I could change any of the code myself. I didn't have to take anyone's word for it that the software wasn't flawed or backdoored since I could check it myself. I wasn't dependent and helpless whenever a developer stopped maintaining my favorite program. I could add or change a feature easily in any of the code. I myself owned my computer and the programs on it in a sense truer than physical ownership.
Bitcoin is free and open software, but it also provides a similar thing again to value transfer. I don't have to worry about a bank deciding not to service me or whatever business model. I don't have to deal with some complex terms of service and agreements that legally bind me every way under the bank. I don't have to have my funds controlled by someone else in order to do anything useful with them, like make online payments. I can check the protocol and design. I'm in direct control of my own funds.

There are already other decentralized cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin, some of which have improvements that can not be added to Bitcoin itself. (There are extreme amounts of investments in Bitcoin mining, so it's unrealistic to expect the mining network to agree to changes that could cut into their profits.)

However, their improvements aren't exactly killer features, so I don't foresee a mass exodus to any of them any time soon. I guess some of them will carve out their own niche behind Bitcoin, like we've seen Litecoin do already.

Blockchain.info and likely others will record the IP they first receive a transaction from. You can use Bitcoin through Tor to protect against that.
But most likely, any attempts to track you will just follow your transactions through the blockchain instead. For example, if law enforcement sees your bitcoins coming from an address they know to be MtGox, they could kindly ask MtGox who they belong to, and then they could question that person to see if they're you, or if there are more transactions the coins went through, they could ask that person who they sent their bitcoins to.
Or if you post an address online publicly and it receives some bitcoins, and then you later do a transaction that spends those bitcoins and bitcoins you have in other addresses at the same time, then it's very strong evidence that you control all of those bitcoins and addresses being spent in that transaction.

My TI-84 couldn't factor that in half a second either, but it's still turing complete. If you look up the instructions to factor a number, have enough paper and time, you can compute it too the same way. The brain isn't very general purpose or reprogrammable so sadly you can't just reprogram your brain to do it much more directly.


No one has made an intelligent program to do that yet. General purpose computers usually need the right software to do much of interest.
The sentence "you are an organic computer" leaves a bit to be desired. If you interpret it as "organic computer" is one of many things you are, then it's obviously valid. After all, the original computers were people trained to work out computations on paper and follow instructions. You are also an intelligence; your desktop computer lacks that.

I always thought the pay-to-IP feature had a nugget of a good idea, but was laughable in its implementation. It's good to see it revisited in a less bad way.
I'm a bit cautious about the new dependency on the Certificate Authority system, and I question how it will work specifically. ~~If people are making a new address per transaction, then do they have certificates for all of those addresses? With most CAs today that would be expensive.~~ I hope that it's easy for users to import CAs, and that it's obvious in UI what CAs that certificates are trusted by.

Why is Litecoin popular, besides that it's already popular? It used to be that it was "GPU-resistant" and made CPU-mining profitable (which was interesting, though I don't think it's a very good goal in its self), but later people managed to GPU-mine it anyway. Its other change of note is the lower block time target (2.5 minutes if I remember right), but Primecoin has a similar low block time target along with some better not-outdated innovation (and coincidentally is only CPU-mineable right now, though that may change in the future).

The address that you had him send the coins to is controlled by localbitcoins, not you. When someone sends bitcoins to it, the site credits your localbitcoins account, and then manages the actual bitcoins on its own. When you withdraw bitcoins later from localbitcoins, they might not be the same ones that you received from that address. This also adds in a bit of anonymity.
@_date: 2013-08-09 04:23:47
Litecoin's main goal of leveling the mining playing field never struck me as that great of a goal. And then it failed to even do that when people managed to make GPU miners for it anyway. It didn't bring much else besides a lower block target time for faster transactions.
Personally, I find Primecoin to be one of very few altcoins with good innovation (namecoin and ppcoin being two others I'm a fan of). It also happens to still be pretty easy to profitably mine on regular hardware right now. It does Litecoin's main benefits better than Litecoin while also having some actually interesting innovation, so I wonder if it might gain more traction from that crowd.
@_date: 2013-08-07 08:25:18
Every block can only hold so many transactions. If the limit is hit, miners will prioritize transactions based on the fees the transactions choose to pay and on the coin ages (large transactions of coins that haven't been moved in a long time get preferential treatment). (And some miners simply ignore transactions that pay a fee they decide is too low.) If you're spamming millions of transactions, you're going to lose a lot of money in the fees you choose to pay, or if you don't pay fees then your transaction spam is going to be slow at getting included into the blockchain.

I'm skimming the patent, and I don't see how this is like Bitcoin. It's not a decentralized currency. It's just a different interface for using existing bank accounts they control. It's only anonymous to the users. The whole system runs on trusted servers they control and can see what's happening on to manage dollars.
The stuff that made Bitcoin revolutionary isn't that it works over the internet, or has receive-only addresses. The revolutionary part was that it was decentralized. It didn't rely on any trusted or privileged groups or servers. All nodes that people run are equal. There is no central minting group who can secretly mint more or change the minting rules. The currency itself is limited. This proposal does not involve any of that. As far as I can tell, the only Bitcoin-like thing in this is the presence of the words "anonymous" (in a weak manner as I mentioned) and "payment".

There's a ton of other projects based on the Bitcoin code that have their own blockchain and addresses. Most of them are zero-innovation crap used by people who missed the Bitcoin popularity and value explosion and jump on anything new early just in case it might get popular too. I won't name any of these obviously zero-innovation clonecoins here as they don't deserve the shout-out. But I think the altcoins that actually do something innovative that can't be retroactively added to Bitcoin are worthy enough. Most of their current trade is in speculation (moreso than Bitcoin), but I think Litecoin's success shows there's room for good alts. Here are some of the more interesting altcoins:
* Namecoin. Besides working similar to Bitcoin, it implements a decentralized DNS system. You can rent a .bit domain name (or just a name in an arbitrary namespace) for a specific price which just destroys the namecoins spent. Very cool idea. Sadly the client software for it is not easy to set up at all, so it's not used for this feature very much anywhere. I would love to see progress there. To avoid splitting Bitcoin's miner base and to get the security of many of its miners, it allows merge-mining where miners can mine Bitcoins and Namecoins at the same time.
* Litecoin. I'm not a big fan of its goal, but it did have some innovation and is significant enough to mention. Well, technically the innovation was Tenebrix, but it took Litecoin to do it right. Tenebrix was a bitcoin-derivative which used scrypt instead of sha256 as its hashing function. Bitcoin's sha256 function is easy and more profitable to run on video cards, making CPU mining not very worthwhile. Tenebrix wanted CPU mining to be worthwhile, and the idea was that scrypt couldn't be implemented on video cards. (It turned out they were wrong though.) Now, the creators of Tenebrix did a particularly crummy thing: they mined it secretly for a long time before releasing it, building up their own giant stash of coins. And then the developers didn't keep its client software up-to-date with Bitcoin's. The Litecoin developers based Litecoin on the most recent version of Bitcoin and kept it up-to-date, used Tenebrix's idea of using scrypt, made Litecoin without a premine, and it got popular. Litecoin is more profitable to mine on video cards, like Bitcoin, but due to a smaller mining network and lack of FPGA/ASIC miners it may still be more profitable to mine Litecoin than Bitcoin.
* PPCoin. The idea behind PPCoin ("peer to peer coin") was that instead of only using proof-of-work (mining) to secure the blockchain, it could also use something called proof-of-stake instead. It still used proof-of-work primarily at the start, but over time proof-of-work becomes less profitable. Proof-of-work makes blocks by spending computing power, which is hard to do faster than the rest of the network. Proof-of-stake "spends" coin age to make blocks, which is hard to do faster than the rest of the network. (An attacker would have to control a lot of ppcoins already in order to do a proof-of-stake attack, and then the attacker would not be able to prolong it very long because the coin ages are used up quickly.) This means that eventually proof-of-work mining is unnecessary for the PPCoin network to work and be secure. It's much more energy efficient (and so more environmentally friendly) without requiring a worldwide miner network. I don't know all the details of how proof-of-stake works yet, and whether it works out well in practice (does it encourage hoarding too much?), so it's an interesting one to keep an eye on as time goes on.
* Primecoin. (It's a recent altcoin made by the same developer as PPCoin, though it does not use PPCoin's proof-of-stake feature.) It still uses proof-of-work, but instead of using sha256 hashing for proof-of-work, it relies on prime chain finding as its proof-of-work. Miners search for large [Cunningham chains]( instead of brute-forcing sha256 hashes, and then use the prime number chain itself as the proof-of-work, and puts that into the blockchain. That means anyone can peruse the public blockchain to find thousands of long prime chains. (Many of the world records for largest prime chains of specific lengths have been thoroughly beaten by the many Primecoin miners.) With Bitcoin (and all other current proof-of-work-based derivatives), all of the computational power of all of the miners goes solely into verifying the latest block and making otherwise gibberish values useless outside of that context. With Primecoin, all of the mining power makes some at least otherwise interesting output at the same time. There's something more to show for all of that worldwide mining effort. (Finding prime chains isn't near as useful as [protein folding]( for example, but there's no known good way to implement that sort of protein folding computation into a decentralized cryptocurrency.)

I think that Bitcoin's inelastic money supply is a defect, but one that's currently necessary until someone manages to solve it in a decentralized way in a new cryptocurrency.

Note that when multiple bitcoins are used together, they don't really retain their identity in any standard way. Say Alice receives the last bitcoin, receives five more from somewhere else, and sends all six to Bob (all to the same address). Bob's balance is just the number six now. The coins don't have any individual identities. If he sends three to Charlie now, then did Charlie get the "last bitcoin"? You could make up the convention that coin identities are sent in the order they're received, but you have to track that yourself.

Note that btct.co has both ASICMINER-PT, which are full shares, and TAT.ASICMINER, which are 1/100 of a share (and pay out 0.95% of a whole share's dividends).
Some other recent interesting things on btct.co include AMC-PT (soon to be renamed to ACTIVEMINING), which is just starting out and hoping to compete with ASICMINER, but who knows if they'll make it anywhere. The IPO had some issues, but they've re-organized themselves since. They're based out of the US (ASICMINER is Chinese), so I don't know if that's a good sign legally.
In the bonds section, I've been looking at LTC-ATF.B2. It only gives about 2/3 of the dividends that ASICMINER currently does for your buck if I remember my math right, but since it's a bond and not a stock, its price is more stable, and you don't have to worry so much about the chance of its price dipping after you buy it and losing you more than your dividends earn. (You also lose the possibility it will become more valuable of course.)


It wouldn't be too hard to bypass; it's not like you have to verify your identity to btct.co. Though if it comes to officially blocking US citizens and you make more than a little bit of money from btct.co, you might have some trouble reporting it in your taxes I guess. I don't really know.

You would have to get everyone to agree to the change. (Of course, once you got a majority, everyone sane would follow.)
People with large bitcoin holdings, and miners who rely on their bitcoin profits, would never agree to changes that might devalue their bitcoins. If the max number of bitcoins were increased, then all bitcoins would be worth less. If the max number of bitcoins were decreased, then that could cause a loss of confidence in the market that would cause bitcoins to be worth less. Therefore it's extremely unlikely that any of the rules regarding the production numbers of bitcoins will ever change.

What they calculate isn't important, besides that it takes a long time to calculate, but is quick for anyone to verify that work was put into making it. It's called proof-of-work. A block of transactions is only accepted into the blockchain if a proof-of-work is attached to it, and if the block is based on the longest chain of blocks in the blockchain. This means everyone will agree on the same blockchain by picking the one with the most work put into it. Without proof-of-work, anyone could create their own blockchain and no one would be able to agree on where bitcoins were sent. Double-spend attacks wouldn't ever be resolved.

The mining pool tells the miners a lower difficulty than the Bitcoin network is at. This causes the miners to send many proof-of-works that aren't valid for the overall Bitcoin network, but prove to the mining pool that the miner is doing work. Later, when a miner manages to generate a proof-of-work that happens to be valid for the Bitcoin network's difficulty level, the mining pool divides the rewards between all of its miners proportional to how many POWs each has sent. This way, the miners don't have to be trusted to self-report how much work they're doing. They prove it to the mining pool the same way stand-alone miners prove themselves to the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin requires the whole mining network to be able to communicate at relatively low-latency in order to be efficient. You can still use Bitcoin transactions in a network with high latency, but each network partition (different planets) would probably want their own Bitcoin chain in order to be dependent. (There could be exchanges to trade different planets' currencies of course.) But with large network partitions, the danger of a foreign entity pulling off a 51% attack is much more real. I think some sort of blockchain based on proof-of-stake (similar to what ppcoin uses) would be much more likely to survive in that environment than a purely proof-of-work one like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:50:43
There are limits on what the proof-of-work function can be. It can't rely on an artificial dataset, or else the maintainers of the dataset would have a huge incentive to publish false data that they have already "mined". The proof-of-work should also not be profitable outside of the system, or else it could make 51% attacks cheaper.
It's extremely unlikely that Bitcoin's own proof-of-work system will ever change, or else that will de-value the large investments people have made into mining systems, and those people won't support the change.
Primecoin is the only bitcoin-derivative I know that has explored a "useful" proof-of-work system.

Namecoins are a separate cryptocurrency that is based on Bitcoin, set up so they can be mined at the same time as Bitcoins, and are used to maintain a decentralized domain name system. The decentralized domain name system is a very cool idea, though sadly it's not very popular and the software for using it sucks.
You can sell namecoins for bitcoins on certain exchanges.

The 10 minute confirmation could be viewed as equivalent to the 30-day time window after paying with a credit card, since with a credit card a transaction can usually be reversed during that time. With Bitcoin, the 10 minute confirmation time is the time to cement the transaction to be practically irreversible.

I agree with his criticisms of Scrypt coins completely, and have a little more to say on it. I don't see why it's desirable for application-specific hardware to be more difficult to make. That just means ASICs would be even more expensive, and if someone does manage to make some, they'll probably be the only one making them and will single-handedly own the network.


There is way too much invested into Bitcoin mining for any large changes to happen to how mining or distribution works. If a proof-of-stake proposal was made to Bitcoin, why would any miners accept it when it could make their mining hardware obsolete? There are many possible great innovations that can't get put into Bitcoin for this reason.
The energy efficiency possibilities of proof-of-stake excite me a lot. And I don't see how Primecoin doing two slightly-related things at once is obviously a flaw; I see it as it getting more bang for its buck. You actually have something more to show for all of those proof-of-work statements besides hashes of nonces and hashes.
Where are cryptocurrencies going to be in one hundred years? Is there going to be more and more computing power solely devoted to otherwise meaningless proof-of-work statements as time goes on? If we eventually colonize the galaxy, are there going to be entire planets dedicated to proof-of-work mining machinery? I don't see simple proof-of-work systems lasting far into the future; things resembling proof-of-stake or even newer systems will surely be used by that point. It's very unlikely that Bitcoin can ever change its mining model, so I think the existence of innovative altcoins is desirable. I don't imagine any altcoins surpassing Bitcoin within the next few decades though. Today I would encourage places and people to accept Bitcoin before looking into any altcoins.

The encryption key's security should complement the security of your wallet.dat file. If you're sure of the physical security of the wallet.dat file (or if it's already inside of an encrypted filesystem), then a weak or no encryption key is fine.

I'm not talking about a network segregation attack, though one might be easier if you have more nodes on the network than the rest of the network.

You linked to someone else agreeing with me as a counterpoint?
It used to be believed that no living matter could be described by physics. Digestion and muscles were two of the things that were literally thought of as being accomplished by some mysterious un-understandable life force. Then scientists eventually figured out you could recreate the process of digestion with a modern chemistry set and construct urea with no animal needed. We also now know the mechanism of how muscle cells physically contract. To posit that 'we were wrong about the rest of the body, but we were actually right the whole time about the brain being actually fundamentally different and past the realm of understanding' without evidence is to ignore all of the times we solved a puzzle that was previously believed to forever be past our reach.
Maybe it will turn out that the brain is fundamentally special. Maybe it will turn out that lizardmen control the country. I think it's extremely premature to assume either of these are the case without more evidence. As you say, we don't know all that much about the brain yet; so we don't know enough to assume it's out of the reach of modern physics.

And it's not a proven thing, but there are few reasons to believe that physics is not computable (it might take a long time to simulate in practice though). What would stop someone from simulating physics (possibly very slowly) using transistors? If the physics simulation works correctly, then it should be able to simulate intelligent brains too.

That's the opposite of what Satoshi concludes in the bitcoin paper I just linked to.

Yeah, this concerns me. Properly designed software shouldn't be prone to corrupting files that aren't actively being modified. This doesn't reflect well on Multibit at all.
And in cases where critical files are being modified, a second file should be written out, the system should wait until the file has been fully flushed to disk, and then the original file can be deleted and the second file renamed to its name. Take a lesson from the safety guarantees that modern databases give.

Some operation (something to do with the Fermat primality test, but as far as I can tell a hash function would work similarly for this use) is done on the number after the last prime in a chain to get a value, and if the chain is the minimum length, then the chain isn't counted as a valid proof-of-work if the value comes out lower than the fractional part of the difficulty. In a sense, this part works like Bitcoin's difficulty system. Read the paper or source code if you want a more technical explanation.
Finding prime chains isn't really something that can be directly put to some use like protein folding as far as we know, but the gathering of large amounts of empirical data on them could be useful to a mathematician trying to study their distribution or something.

No, that image is strictly about classical computers. Quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way. A quantum computer with 256 qubits could test all possibilities at once in certain algorithms. It doesn't have to count through 2^256 sequentially.
The good news is that A) progress on quantum computers that can actually do stuff has been negligible as qubits are extremely unstable, never mind getting 256 of them to be stable at once, and B) the cryptographic algorithms in Bitcoin can be changed to ones that are secure against quantum computers if powerful quantum computers are ever successfully made.

Electrum is a deterministic wallet client, isn't it?
Usually in that type of client, you don't choose to create more addresses manually. More will be automatically created as soon as you use more of your unused addresses, so that you always have at least a certain number of unused addresses.
(If you force the client to manually add more addresses, then those addresses might not be linked to the deterministic seed that the wallet is based on. That could cause issues if you throw away the wallet and try to recreate it from the seed.)

Lamport signatures are generally over a hundred times larger than ECDSA signatures, and are one-time use, so you have to publish signed lists of more public keys which need to be broadcasted somewhere and take up even more space.

If the hacker hid himself better, or if you guys didn't investigate, he could have just waited until you remounted the encrypted filesystem. It wasn't just disk encryption that saved you, but also that you investigated further after a surprise reboot. I hope no one reads this account, only takes away that filesystem encryption is good, and then manually mounts the filesystem again immediately after every unexpected reboot (or scripts it over the network).
Also note that this is only a good defense against a user at the local console. It is not a foolproof defense against a user with physical access. They could lift the encryption key out of the system's memory (by removing the RAM from the system while it's very cold, or sometimes peripherals can be used to read RAM of a running system). If the server is a VPS, there are likely very easy ways for them to get into the system's memory with access to the host machine.

I then sent 0.0002 to the address to make up the difference (and bitcoin-qt had been set to 0.01 btc transaction fee -- I or the default must've set that a long time ago, so I spent fifty times more on the fee in that transaction, argh), and then it complained I hadn't sent in 0.0662235 by the time that got 1 confirmation! Make up your damn mind!
EDIT: And now all my transactions to the address are fully verified, and I sent a little bit over just to be sure, and Coinbase still says "Sorry! But we were unable to verify your payment of 0.0663 BTC..."! Blockchain.info shows more than that sent to the address and all verified!
EDIT2: About an hour later after that last edit, I got an email from HiB about the payment going through.

As I understood it (or an equivalent situation) : He copied his wallet file so it was on two computers. He encrypted his wallet file on computer A. He made a transaction on computer B. (This transaction sent some change to a pre-generated address stored in computer B's wallet, but was removed from Computer A's wallet when he encrypted it.) On computer A, the blockchain wasn't synced yet, so it appeared it still had access to all of his bitcoins. He re-synced his wallet files by copying the wallet from computer A to computer B. With the full blockchain, this wallet could no longer access all of the change because it got sent to an address only the old wallet on computer B knew about. He eventually found an old backup of this wallet.
Lessons for users: Always keep backups of wallet files. Make sure the blockchain is fully downloaded before you believe a specific wallet file is good if you had recently made transactions with a different copy of it.
Lessons for developers: There's no reason the bitcoin client should forget about any addresses it ever generated. Don't do that. I get the need to generate new addresses when the wallet is encrypted and the need to not use the old pre-generated addresses, but that doesn't mean they can't just be marked as already used and not automatically used in the future.

If an attacker had more hashing power than the rest of the network, then they could choose to only confirm blocks that have no transactions. All transactions would come to a stop.
There are a few plans to deal with this remote possibility (such as instead of blindly preferring the longest blockchain, factor in the spent coin age of the blockchain's transactions), but it would cause a painful game of cat-and-mouse as bitcoin updates to deal with it.

This attack sounds like it *might be* exploiting a vulnerability in Firefox's javascript interpreter. That's where a lot of vulnerabilities appear, but not all of them. Occasionally there are vulnerabilities elsewhere in browsers.
(I say "might be" because there seems to be little analysis of this so far. It could just be some obfuscated nearly harmless set-a-cookie-on-an-FBI-domain (that gets wiped when you close the browser by default) code. And if there is an exploit, we don't even know what versions of Firefox it affects; it could already be fixed in 17.0.7, which is in the Tor Browser Bundle.)
@_date: 2013-09-02 02:54:24


Right. But that means the time stamp is important: if an attacker somehow convinced the network that nearly no time had passed (or hundreds of years had passed) for 2016 blocks (possibly just by fudging the timestamps in the first and last blocks that the attacker mines), then mining would suddenly slow to a stand-still (or speed up extremely) after the difficulty re-adjustment. Attacks like this have been done against smaller altcoins before protections were put into Bitcoin and its derivatives. I'm not exactly sure what the protections are. I think (correct me if I'm wrong) the Bitcoin client rejects blocks if more than 72 hours pass between them, and/or if the most current block is more than 72 hours from what it believes the present is.
It does make me think that someone in control of a lot of hashing power and a popular NTP time-sync server could have a little fun briefly.

Have you read the Bitcoin whitepaper I linked to? Shorter block times mean the attacker can make blocks quicker, but it also means the honest nodes can make blocks quicker too. As long as the attacker has less hashing power than the rest of the network, then most of the security of the system purely has to do with the number of confirmations. [See this for more information.]( (There is a minor effect where a smaller target time causes slightly more orphan blocks, but it's not very significant unless you start going far below a minute.)

No. Notice that in section 11 of the [original Bitcoin paper]( the confirmation time does not appear anywhere in the calculations of the security of confirmations.
The only issues with lower confirmation times are that blocks have to be broadcast and downloaded more frequently, there's a higher chance of orphan blocks, and an attacker with a time limited 51% attack can undo more blocks during the attack (though spanning about the same time frame as he could have if there were longer confirmation times).

The person receiving the wallet file would either A) have to trust that you haven't held onto a copy of the wallet, or sent another copy to someone else at the same time, or B) would have to immediately sweep all of the wallet's coins into their own addresses, which will be logged into the blockchain.
If avoiding the publicity of the blockchain is important to you, then you should both either trust a service that lets you do transactions off the blockchain, or you should put your coins through a mixer occasionally. (Usually you have to trust the mixer, but there's been recent progress on trustless mixers. The Dark Wallet project is probably working on this direction.)

Most people don't practice good enough computer security. Malware is entirely too common on average people's computers. Anything that's really worked its way into a system can trivially snatch bitcoins from that computer.
The issue mostly is due to a lack of user education, and how often people voluntarily choose to download random executables from the internet and execute them with full privileges. Though on the developer side (of miscellaneous PC software, including browsers; the Bitcoin software itself is very good here), developers need to take vulnerabilities a lot more seriously, and application sandboxing needs to become a lot more effective, easy-to-use, and common in operating systems. (Android did a pretty good try, though got a number of things wrong, such as users not being able to pick and choose privileges for applications.)

Bitcoin (and derivatives) use a blockchain with proof-of-work blocks in order to prevent double-spending attacks. If an attacker pays two people the same funds at the same time, the people have to wait a while to see which transaction the blockchain accepts. It's generally accepted that once a transaction has been in the bitcoin blockchain for over an hour, it's unfeasible for anyone to generate enough proof-of-work blocks to fork the blockchain to a version that the other transaction won. However, if you have more than half of the mining power of all miners, then it's trivial to make your own fork of the blockchain and do a double-spend attack.
tl;dr: I'm pretty sure 51% just lets you do double-spend attacks (and also undo a bunch of mined coins).

Loans can be good without getting into debt though. If you wanted to buy a house or car and had enough cash in hand to buy it immediately, and they offer a loan with a lower interest rate than the returns you could get from investing, then it would be better for you to take the loan, pay the minimum, and invest the rest of the money and take it back out as needed for payments.

If they don't have a bitcoin address published publicly, then there isn't a decentralized solution besides asking them to set up a bitcoin wallet first and tell you the address, or sending them a private key that contains their tip, but that's not the most user-friendly thing, and can encourage bad habits if they don't know to move the funds off of that address immediately.

Think of it as a Paypal alternative that you don't have to worry about Paypal or anyone setting limits on your account, charging you high fees, or freezing your account if they think it looks suspicious. That's what Bitcoin's decentralization means.

Do they have any real competition? It seems like everyone else in the market are clowns relatively.

Why would DPR fake a private exchange with FC and readandwhite? It would only be revealed if he got busted, and its biggest consequence would be to increase the charges against DPR.
DPR is at least a bit of an idiot of course for mixing up his identities early on that lead to him getting busted.

There's a few good and interesting ones, such as Namecoin, ppcoin, and Primecoin. But there are also an amazing amount of zero-innovation crap ones. The "Alternate cryptocurrencies" subforum on bitcointalk is filled with so much crap. I think this is what the real criticism is for. There are tons of Bitcoin/Litecoin clones where nothing more than the genesis block and a few parameters are changed with little justification. (Often changed to ridiculous values; some change it so only 3 confirmations are needed for a transaction, which combined with the smaller mining network makes it much easier to double-spend. Another one literally had a 6 second block target time!) It seems to mostly be people who are sad they missed the Bitcoin explosion and profitable mining, and are looking for any new clonecoins to launch that they can get in on mining early. Tons of them are premined even, so the "developers" can make a quick buck and then dump the altcoin.

Right, old habit from talking about Litecoin.

Your computer is compromised. Malware stole the private keys to your wallets. Virus scanners generally can only find malware that they already recognize, so it must have been some uncommon or new kind.
There isn't anything you can do to recover them. You should stop using the laptop for anything sensitive, reformat it entirely and reinstall the OS, and change all of your passwords that you might have ever typed into it.
Using a vulnerable browser or browser plugin might have caused this. I know that Internet Explorer recently had a remote code execution vulnerability. The Java browser plugin seems to have a new one every month. I highly recommend disabling the Java browser plugin, and also any Adobe/Acrobat PDF reader plugins. Make sure any other plugins you have such as Flash are kept up-to-date. ([Mozilla's Plugin Checker]( is useful.) Another possibility is that some software you downloaded onto the laptop had a trojan virus included. Pirated software can easily have a trojan bundled with it, so I also highly recommend making sure to not to use pirated software on any computers with sensitive information. Antivirus software is good to have, but don't rely on it as they can't notice everything.
To secure bitcoins, I'd recommend people use an offline wallet, or Linux because it's less often targeted, there is a wider range of free open source software available for it that's less likely to be bundled with malware or hopelessly outdated and vulnerable, and it's easier to keep software up-to-date with a package manager which is standard on most Linux distributions. You can set aside an older computer to have your wallet if you want to use an offline wallet, or don't want to run Linux on your main computer. (Note that running Linux inside a virtual machine or on dualboot on a possibly compromised computer is not very secure! It needs to be a separate machine, or booted off of removable media that you never connect while running the possibly compromised OS.)

That's why they do it in secret prisons located out of the country.

I feel like this should just be changed to "Do you pirate software?". The method of piracy (torrents) isn't important since as far as I know, there aren't any recent exploits affecting torrent software. People who pirate music and videos and are smart enough to not run exe files bundled with them aren't really at risk. Pirated software can easily be bundled with malware that antivirus software won't detect, regardless of whatever method you use to pirate.

Isn't Spots just a clone of the shitty Nuggets bitcoin-clone pump and dump? There's nothing innovative here. It's just a clonecoin trying to make a buck from suckers and doing silly publicity stunts. There are many more just like this.

That screen only comes up the first time you visit a site that's currently getting more activity than usual, and I think it just consists of a page that has your browser send some info about it to cloudflare via javascript, mostly to confirm your browser isn't a simple javascript-less bot. (I haven't gotten around to checking it.)

By "make it work" I mean make it legally enforceable.

It would let them recognize a user again at a different website with a different IP.
Though some [analysis]( of the code has been done, and it looks like it is in fact an exploit of older Firefox versions. (The version of Firefox in the current Tor Browser Bundle does not appear to be affected.)

You can't be sure of that. It's possible for everyone mining to be doing it with negative profits.

Paypal can facilitate scams against sellers that aren't possible with Bitcoin, and Paypal can also decide to freeze your account at any time if they feel like it.

My only exposure to devcoin is seeing it support a [driveling idiot]( so I'm not sure I have too high of an opinion of it. Devcoin might be a well-intentioned idea that's good in theory at least.

I assume that's what they mean by "staining", but I can't imagine what the mechanism is. If you modify a message that's encrypted with an authenticated cipher, then the next hop won't decrypt it successfully because it's changed.

You can't. At least, not without a few quadrillion+ years to spare. (I'm assuming by password you mean private key? An encryption password only applies to someone in possession of an encrypted private key here.)


That's not how it was tracked. The admin of SR made some rookie mistakes making it easy for investigators to find him. He used an email address that had his full birthname with the same screen name that he advertised SR's opening with.

Centralized digital currencies can use crypto to achieve some stronger anonymization properties than Bitcoin by using blind signatures. (It's not a feasible thing for Bitcoin to do.)
