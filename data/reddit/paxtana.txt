If I wanted to do this could I still make transactions same as before, like will the people I want to do business with still accept it as bitcoin? Can I use same Electrum wallet as before? 
Is there a walkthrough?

I think he is saying that pro-establishment guys like Glenn Beck are not real conservatives (fiscal conservatives)
@_date: 2014-05-06 01:57:03
Well alright then, if you say so. I don't pay attention to people like that so you may know more than me, would you say he counts as a fiscal conservative? Do you see tea party politicians cutting funding for the defense department and other out of control budgets?

Thanks, I contacted them and asked if they could support bitpay. Been super impressed with how easily bitpay works when I pay for stuff and ideally this is what I would like for the hotspot payment processing.

Cool, thanks for the help.

But how would paypal ever know if it is a transaction between two individuals and not some store? And why would the seller be in danger anyway, when I bought Dogecoin with paypal all the seller had me do was mark the money as a gift so the transaction could not be reverted later.

The corporate establishment? You bet. Maybe not the government establishment unless they are republican but he's always supported all those wall street douchebags. He was employed by Fox News after all. I wouldn't be surprised if some corporate investor paid him to talk about it, I think in mainstream media these days they call it a sponsored segment.

I guess I don't understand how it works because I was under the assumption I could do it online anonymously with an overseas seller. Like I agree on a price, transfer via paypal and they transfer to a wallet. How would they have information on me to do a sting? 
I don't mind paying a premium for anonymity if that is indeed what I am getting. Am I mistaken? Is there some other service that would be better suited to this goal?

Yeah I hate them too, they screwed me over in the past. But I sell on ebay so I have to deal with them.

K thanks !
@_date: 2014-02-22 22:41:55
Well what would you suggest?

Hey I just stumbled upon this thread while browsing and I've been wondering about buying bitcoins with paypal since I already have the money in a paypal account. While the consensus here seems to be that it is not safe for you to sell with paypal is it safe for me to buy with paypal? I was thinking of using localbitcoins to do it.

Seems like you have nothing to say but divisive bullshit. 
If you are not going to engage in constructive conversation then please go away.

That's cool as shit

If this Coinjoin works does that mean Shared Coin works as well? 
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:48:15
I'm not comfortable giving them all that information though. Do they ask for all that if I sign up at localbitcoins? How much personal info do they ask at Coinrnr, that's another I was recommended to look into.
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:37:29
I am no expert but it seems you would gain a significant level of plausible deniability just by transferring bitcoin to your local wallet before spending it. I see no hard evidence that it belongs to you. Am I wrong?

Can somebody explain to me who BFL is and why I should care?

I know this is offtopic but do we have good reason to think that any website could protect our personal information *forever*? Especially popular websites with valuable info on them? If you look at a timeline of important companies that have been hacked over the past decade it kinda looks like everybody gets hacked at some point. Spread that timeline out 70 years into the future, for a site that still has all your most important personal info on it decades after they stopped being used or relevant, is their netsec going to be top notch that whole time?

In the future drugs will become obsolete, you can stimulate the same receptors with electromagnetic stimulation via external electrodes on a headset. 
Sites will sell code that instructs the headset to operate in such a way as to affect the particular receptors you want to stimulate. All this is not only theoretically possible it has been proven in real world applications. Opiate receptors in particular have been stimulated this way. Only thing yet to happen is a standardized headset and API for people to work on. It will likely look something like [this.](
