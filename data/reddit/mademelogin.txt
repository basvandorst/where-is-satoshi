No shit, sherlock
Your patreon is quite impressive, however.  You are *extremely* good at marketing yourself, I'm surprised it hasn't taken off yet.  You're the type of guy that be making money selling self-help books 'n shit.

Well that's where I came from, so call me a vote brigader all you want.
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:54:56
