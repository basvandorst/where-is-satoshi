So when people suggest LN will help BTC, and we say LN is already out, and BTC still needs helping, what then?
In other words, when people ask when LN a will be out, maybe the better question would be, “When will the really important effects we’re all excited for be noticeable?”
Note: I love BTC. Just trying to clarify here.

Strange to pay gains when gains have not been realized.

It would be fun to do this survey, but have everyone include their current dollar cost average.
Could provide some interesting coorelations.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:06:35
Silly question.
If I invest $1k, and Bitcoin rises to $5k, and I sell $1k (original investment) and leave the rest in the market, I don’t pay taxes for selling the $1k, correct?
Assuming the rest remains in the market.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:39:02
So it's based on the number of units sold, not based on the cash-in cash-out?
* I take $1000 out of my pocket and put it into a machine.
* $1000 turns into $5000 inside of machine.
* I pull $1000 outside of machine and put it in my pocket
* I have somehow realized gains, even though I never had more than $1000 in my pocket.
Not trying to argue, just new to this.

Wanted to wait for that $5,500 mark, but it kept rising after the day's low peak.
Personally saw BCH dip and BTC start to rise, so I got back in at $6,300.
To $10k we go!

With 21M coin in circulation, it would put the market cap beyond reasonable means. (63 trillion?)

Silly question: at the time of going under, was Mt Gox percieced to be as bonafide as Gdax/Coinbase?
Note: not suggesting Gdax/Coinbase are bonafide to not.
Just looking get a feel what Mt Gox felt like at the time, if that makes sense.

Silly question: why would someone use Coinbase instead of GDAX?

I just moved some money on Electrum, and it seems transaction fees are chosen by the user using the slider.

@_date: 2017-07-30 17:27:26
Gotchya, thank you.
I had personally recommended that statement as specifically vague. Like, "oh, we _recommended_ you withdrawal by Monday, but we didn't know XYZ would happen, so it's not on us that you didn't withdrawal sooner."
On the flip side, even though the final sentence does not explicitly guarantee anything, I suppose it sort of guarantees implicitly.
