Wow, I just uploaded a bunch of my albums and it took less than a half an hour. Very user friendly website. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:35:50
So somebody's going to tip me? 
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:18:03
Price could crash again. Also, Trump and the wave of right wing elections in Europe could cause a crackdown on it. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 04:58:47
Fucking sketch.

"A single act of wire fraud can result in fines and up to 20 years in prison. However, if the wire fraud scheme affects a financial institution or is connected to a presidentially declared disaster or emergency, the potential penalties are fines of up to $1,000,000 and up to 30 years in prison."

Never a bad idea to sell of part or all of any investment when you're up big. That's one of the general rules of investing, don't be afraid to quit while you're ahead. Selling half is the best of both worlds.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:15:12
A week ago this would've been a bad call.
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:40:43
Depending on when you bought in, now might be a great time to sell at least some of your bitcoin. The mania is nowhere near the last bubble, and the ascent has been fairly slow and steady. But this kinda post makes me want to sell.
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:36:20
Quality shitpost. I knew the price was ready to swing downward, at least temporarily when I saw all the greedy delusional posts pouring in. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:43:33
I know bitcoin's price history very well. Saying it's bubble history is proof that it will end up higher than the previous high is like saying there's a law that it'll crash back down to $200 like it did last time it hit $1000. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:40:24
If you invested $1100 and it magically turned into $800, that is not a good call. Nobody knows what's going to happen to the price long term. It could go back down to $200 or up to a million dollars. People who bought at the last peak had to wait years just to break even.
@_date: 2017-01-17 20:32:19
How many years did this take?

Kim Dotcom has an excellent track record of hype then disappointment.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:20:58
Price rising enormously for no good reason? Definitely not bubble territory
@_date: 2016-12-01 00:56:45
Anyone else in a position that if you ever got "busted" by the IRS for crypto trading, that you'd just end up finally being able to claim your huge losses?
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:31:42
This is why cybersecurity is an issue. They don't want any hackers to do the audit for them.
@_date: 2016-12-04 23:14:59
It lost less than 2 pennies in USD worth. Chart looks way more crazy than it is. Truth is that the euro has been on the decline for quite a while now.
@_date: 2016-11-07 18:19:26
Good luck.
@_date: 2016-12-04 23:37:01
Meh, if you look at the chart going back, these kinds of fluctuations happened all last week too.

Or 0.

IRS is going to be in for a big surprise when it finds out that probably a majority of people, even with the rise in BTC lately, ended up with loses. 
@_date: 2016-11-05 22:57:46
A $46M scam is a lot more detrimental to society than petty theft. It's quite the opposite of contributing to society, it's theft on a massive scale.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:30:33
Bitcoin getting pumped by the finance sector is also a bad look.
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:30:47

Tell her to learn about investing and to buy things when they're low in price and not in what could very well be peak mania.
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:28:50
Maybe a tad bit off topic, but what happened to credit cards during today's outages? Did they still work? Do they run on a private network or via phone?
@_date: 2016-10-18 14:28:13
Don't worry, as soon as Clinton figures out what Bitcoin is, she'll figure out a way to make it illegal.
@_date: 2016-10-22 02:22:15
I think the reason Bitcoin will possibly rise in the long term is because of holders dying and nobody having access to their bitcoin. Ie, forgotten/lost/dead owned bitcoin automatically shrink the available supply. This will only increase in the future imo.
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:40:59
Why not both?
@_date: 2016-10-01 01:05:40
Lol, aren't the central banks stepping in? Or is that just a disgusting rumor.

If there isn't a way for her donors to make money from it at everyone else's expense, it'll be highly regulated or illegal.

BTC will go below 2000 for an extended period of time in less than a month.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:01:14
This is so dumb. The stock market had a tiny blip while remaining near all time highs. It will be interesting to see what happens to BTC's price if there's a massive stock crash or bear market. But this is a joke.
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:47:39
I don't know if it's going to 10k plus. I thought it was a good deal at 450.
@_date: 2016-10-18 16:18:23
I don't really care about Trump, I don't think he's got a shot at winning the election. But the difference between the two is that Clinton is deeply engrained in the corrupt system, and Trump is basically just a small time crook without the means of being as corrupt unless he wins.
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:28:32
In comparison but it's at a price that I wouldn't dare buy into.
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:00:06
You can't make money if you don't sell either.
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:41:25
It's an interesting case because they have to know that a decent portion of the funds on there are from traders.
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:29:47
If it's true the price will be ravaged.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:53:17
A large exchange goes down, and presumably another large group of people end up losing money, and it's great news for crypto. LOLOLOLOLOLOL
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:27:05
What reason would he have to cooperate? You think they'd give him a plea deal that would avoid jail time? No way. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:45:37
Btc-e users have a better shot at getting their funds than Gox victims getting Btc-e's funds.
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:14:47
What is afk?
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:41:11
I'm talking specifically regarding the verbage of the laws BTC-E and it's owner are being prosecuted under. The burden of proof involves knowing that the transaction involves unlawful money. Not to mention the most applicable charge involves transactions greater than $10k, which I doubt most btc-e users did. 
As a user, you have no idea where bitcoin or any other coin is coming from if you buy it on any exchange. Whereas, the guy being charged is specifically implicated in knowingly moving large amounts of illicit funds from gox. However, if you had laundered money through the exchange, you could theoretically be charged.  
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:59:36
US jurisdiction = the world.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:19:35
I'll keep my fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:52:27
No, because no users knew that Btc-e was behind illicit operations.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:30:23
It was only worth a thousand a couple of months ago. And before that even less.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:42:15
They probably did this right before Aug 1 to maximize the amount of assets they could steal.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:35:35
"The indictment also points to suspicious usernames like "ISIS," "CocaineCowboys," "blackhathackers," "dzkillerhacker," and "hacker4hire" as additional support for the money-laundering allegations." IN A FUCKING CHATBOX CALLED THE TROLLBOX YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKERS
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:25:54
Don't worry, the sale will be extended until May 2019.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:39:29
The real steal phase since the last bubble was at about $300.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:10:44
" thus all persons who ever deposed money or Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in BTC-e may be seen by the US as co-conspirators." no. Nobody knew that money laundering was going on there. It's obvious that a large portion of the funds and trading were normal crypto investors. Specifically, with altcoins listed there that had more volume on that exchange than others.
Anyway, as far as what happens. I think it's probably shut down for good. The only way I see it re-opening in 5-10 days is if they are doing a massive overhaul that includes proper fintech requirements. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:41:54
It'll be interesting to see what happens to the btc-e funds through all this.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:44:34
It's not a low price.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:16:19
Why not just buy 1500 worth whenever you feel like it, and see what happens before taking out a lone.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:07:20
They wouldn't. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:55:35
One possible scenario would be that the site is allowed to reopen if they implement proper procedures. That would obviously take a bit of time. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:20:57
This is similar to the US's war on terror. Lots of civilian casualties in the quest to take out financial terrorists.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:27:08
Fuck Goldman Sachs.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:45:46
Terrible idea, but much better than a few weeks ago. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:41:04
I agree on the downward trend, but it might take a lot longer than a month to realize $500 or whatever the bottom is.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:26:19
Lots of money going into exchanges for trading. Lots of money staying in exchanges longer than it should because of anticipated high volatility.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:33:25
You're describing a fair number of altcoins.

You could cause a flash crash, or end the bull market.
