Just use a public .BIT DNS in your networks settings.
Here is a tutorial from Cryptonit ( the best Namecoin Exchange around, imho. I am using and suggesting the .bit DNS Server often for testing.

Here is an other alternative:
If you just want to have a fast look on .bit domains, you can use a proxy server, for example:

Squatter is such a bad word - what would happen if two people think, they "own" a domain like apple.bit?
There one and only correct solution for this is: domain trading. The RPC interface already contains this in Namecoin, and can already be used by tools like: 
All you have to do is writing your own  for the Namecoin community (independent from Namecoin itself).
Nevertheless - not many people know, that you can open millions of new Namecoin related TLD's like ".bittopia". In this case you only need some small changings to DNSChain or an other Namecoin DNS resolver - protocol changings to Namecoin itself are not required.
