You don't get to control exposure, or people's reactions, so there's no use yelling about it.
Everything you're describing are issues that can at worst hinder the growth of the protocol and introduce bottlenecks that prevent people from doing transactions in a timely manner. Yes, many people will lose some coin in the process and get burned. However, bitcoin veterans (counted in hundreds of thousands of knowledgeable early adopters at this point, those people running nodes, mining, discussing bitcoin, discussing code, etc.) are unlikely to miscomprehend why this is happening. They will know exactly what's going on and they will continue to back bitcoin (therefore keeping its value away from zero) because they understand it's an engineering issue.
Before the influx of new (uneducated) blood into the ecosystem these early birds were the only thing that gave the bitcoin its value. The willingness of people who understand bitcoin to back bitcoin with their FIAT is the reason why it became interesting to everyone else. They're unlikely to leave because the protocol hit the 7 tps limit. If anything, they're more likely to solve this issue more quickly under pressure, as they're already heavily invested. (**Edit:** And scalability is not that difficult of an issue anyway. [It will be solved long before we hit the limit](
What I'm saying is - you're looking at the thorny road ahead (which we all expect) with an overly catastrophic trepidation. Can these issues continue the cycle of volatility of bitcoin, causing massive future crashes, hindering new market adoption and causing people who got burned to lose interest? Sure. Will that cause everyone else to shut down their bitcoin nodes and pack up? Unlikely.
People trading bitcoin cannot destroy bitcoin. It's antithetical. Bitcoin will be destroyed when people cease to trade it due to lack of desire. Where there is desire, technical means will be provided sooner or later. Under pressure, sooner rather than later.

Sure it will function the same way, we're not about to change our society overnight and will need to keep roughly the same taxation principles in place. I'm asking about the mechanisms on the side of the bitcoin protocol that would allow for these principles to continue.
Currently, if the government suspects you've underreported, they can look at your bank records and bust you. With bitcoin that control becomes near impossible, because bitcoin behaves like cash. So it feels like we'll soon have to exchange anonymity for ease of adoption.
We'll obviously (especially companies) have to have registered addresses with a central authority in order for them to monitor and control if we reported correct taxes. However, since it's so easy to have as many bitcoin addresses as you want (as opposed to many anonymous bank accounts or many suitcases full of cash), it's MUCH easier to underreport using bitcoin than current financial instruments.

Really? Never? Ever? :)
Of course it's wasteful, everything is wasteful, everything costs energy, and the important thing is to balance the cost/benefit ratio. Bitcoin has a beneficial ratio because of the things you've noted; things we all here pretty much take for granted (given the value of Bitcoin as a tool for humanity). But you can't argue the fact that all those great things about Bitcoin would exist even if miners were sifting through prime number digits in the process like with primecoin (thanks for the heads up, Meaning: there's room for improvement here, so why not leverage it?

How does this translate to the effective operation of the network? If there are more active nodes, does that mean transactions are confirmed faster? In other words, if I put a node on my almost-always-online PC, am I helping the community in any practically relevant way?

Yeah, I can imagine the blockchain being a perfectly effective and very transparent accounting tool, however this would require zero anonymity for all wealth-generating subjects (companies) and their beneficiaries (owners and employees), in order to track their transactions to and from other subjects. You'd have to have registered addresses or address pools. Sending BTC to an anonymous address, not registered with anyone, would be deemed suspicious behaviour. Are you pulling out profits from your company without paying taxes? Are you paying someone off the books?
Bitcoin makes the process both easy (because the blockchain is in effect a global accounting tool) and scary. It's not a trivial problem and it's a very good question to raise early on.

We're all speculators, and those that say otherwise are lying.
