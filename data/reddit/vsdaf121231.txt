I'm not talking about depositing BTC at coinbase at all.. it's all about buying BTC on coinbase and withdrawing them. Obviously you would never re-deposit them to sell there, instead you would spend them or sell them for cash or something later.. but that would all be totally unreported.

hmm only 12284837.. so I guess it is overrepresented?

What paper trail? or perhaps what do you think is a better way?

Interesting.. my quick reading of that suggests that payments of less than $600 would not be subject to information reporting.. so as long as you only buy less than $600 and withdraw it immediately there would be no information reporting requirement.. also it generally seems to apply to payments made in "trade or business".. I'm not clear if camwhores payments would even be caught by that at all.

There are currently 937 out of 42971754 UTXOs with the letters slag (in different cases) somewhere in the address. That's .0021805% or 1 in 45860. There are 63 UTXOs with exactly SLAG somewhere in them.
This isn't a great method of calculating the odds, but it was simple and probably fairly accurate although perhaps people tend to deliberately use addresses with those letters in them more than others.

The boating accident is not really good for BTC since they can see if it's still circulating or not on the chain.. I am skeptical though that the IRS can demand proof that someone spent money on something.. it's not something people generally keep records of.. or I guess sure they can ask, but the complete lack of any such records probably wouldn't mean much.

usually the machines want to scan a qr code.. maybe some of them allow manually typing it in on a touchscreen as well, but it'd probably be easier if you bring a qr code printed out.

maybe they could make it so if you submit a transaction with too high a fee they give you some of the fee back as a rebate in return for filling the captcha.. new kind of faucet.
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:49:47
The main difference is that kraken does not have US banking facilities so you have to do a wire transfer to Luxemburg or Germany to get money into it.. those fees can be quite large so it only really makes sense if you're willing to transfer larger amounts of money at once.. maybe over $2k it starts to make sense. As far as the IRS are concerned kraken is a US company and I'm sure they would hand over your transaction information just like coinbase did.

Yea I think it will probably happen.. I used the original changetip a few times, but never the new one even though I was tipped occasionally.. too much hassle to sign up and give another service your email address etc. It needs to be smooth and permisisonless and inexpensive.. LN can make all that possible again.
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:49:02
doesn't sound like a very practical way to look at things for the IRS.. the incentive would be NOT to prove you were in control of the new address.. trivial to avoid paying taxes, and really everyone should have been doing this already anyway for security reasons.
@_date: 2016-12-04 23:58:36
by allowing people to hold coins in their own payment channel wallets instead of a shared wallet like chaingetip (current changetip) which imposed kyc requirements (at least sometimes), or using bare bitcoin transactions (like the original changetip) which are too costly for change tipping.

yea. it also works with interac online if your bank supports that.. there are other exchanges too such as [quadrigacx]( and [kraken]( this one requires making an international wire transfer).

I dont think there's any need to explain the tumbler.. presumably the camwhore tumbled the coins after you paid her.. nothing you can do about that.
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:18:35
he's probably right though :p
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:53:30
not really.. just the fees for onchain transactions will go up.. and up and up.. perhaps one day onchain transactions will be $20 each or even more.. but LN transactions will still be cheap because so many of them are bundled into one bitcoin transaction.. it will also help to limit UTXO growth as noone will be using the main chain for moving small amounts of BTC anymore.
@_date: 2016-12-06 00:05:54
localbitcoins.com cash deposits are one way to get BTC without showing ID.. if you are using it a lot though, you probably will just want to get ID'd with an exchange for convenience and fees.
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:10:50
make a script that submits all transactions via their tool ? I guess it'd get banned though.. maybe do it through tor rotating exit points every request.

Not quite sure I understand what you mean here.. do you mean that you no-longer have a buying basis point price so they assume you bought them for $0 and would tax 100% of the "gain"? Because that would only be a problem for someone trying to sell the coins on coinbase which is an important point but out of scope imo.
It's extremely easy to dispose of BTC anonymously.. it isn't easy to buy though, which is why people use coinbase. Obviously someone would have to be selling on coinbase to close the loop, but that's a slightly more complicated laundering operation suitable for banks and other professional crooks :p
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:30:54
obviously you wouldn't say that though.. you'd say something else like I spent it all on camwhores or the private key sank in a tragic boating accident.. definitely don't still have the now vastly appreciated money anymore!
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:56:50
apparently coinbase aren't actually sending this info to the IRS it's just or your own benefit and it's still up to you to report whatever you want to the IRS.. I'm not sure if they're sending it as a one off due to the court order or if they're sending different info.. if the IRS does end up taking the same approach in interpreting the data then it really seems like they're trying hard to let everyone off the hook.
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:09:18
I'm guessing that it almost doesn't exist. If anyone is doing it, it's probably at a small firm or freelancer type gig where the boss is just manually buying on an exchange and sending the BTC.
In the past it was possible to setup your payroll to pay to speedybitcoin with a unique reference that caused them to emit BTC to a predefined address, however that service no-longer exists and there still really aren't any services with stable UK banking.. even if you find one, it probably won't be around in a few months time.. or at least the bank account will have changed.
It might be possible to do this if your employer could pay you in EUR instead of GBP to a UK account.. otherwise I would suggest to open a  account and try and get your salary deposited there.. once there it's very easy and inexpensive to send to your money to kraken or any EUR exchange to buy BTC yourself. Fidor has excellent GBP to EUR conversion rates and the SEPA transfer is only £2.49. This could even be automated using their [REST API]( All bitcoin exchanges also have REST APIs so in theory you could make a bot to monitor your fidor account and automatically convert any funds sent there into BTC.
Fidor does not currently offer unique per customer account numbers.. everyone has the same communal account number and sort code and the customer is identified by the unique reference number.. yes it's insane, but it sort of works. They recently said they intend to offer personal account numbers within "weeks".. in the meantime to get your salary deposited would require your company's HR system to specify a unique reference number that identifies your account.. YMMV.

The best way is cash deposit at a bank. You can find sellers offering that on  while there are voucher sites like paxful.com or dodges like purse.io, you're basically get ripped off by the fees.. cash deposit is the most efficient way.. that all said, none of these are anonymous against modern dragnet surveillance so maybe it's not even worth bothering and just register on an exchange and send id.

what if you buy BTC on coinbase and immediately withdraw it so there's no loss or gain, but keep it in your own wallet.. does coinbase/the IRS by default just not care about that? 'cause you know, the guy probably sold it according to coinbase so there's nothing to tax since he sold it at the same price.
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:57:53
I dunno, I mean I almost feel like they've done this on purpose to let people get away with it.. I mean when it looks like they're bending over backwards to look the other way it'd be rude not too take advantage right ?
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:42:00
From our discussion I think the safest way to avoid paying tax would be to buy the coin, transfer it immediately out of coinbase in amounts less than $600 to avoid taxable gains and reporting of what it's being used for, then mix it so that your original BTC goes back to circulating normally (to foil attempts at following it) and obtain different BTC to save and spend or sell for cash later. That does sound a bit complicated, but it isn't really and actually it's what a lot of people are likely already doing just to avoid coinbase closing their accounts for illegal gambling or whatever.
