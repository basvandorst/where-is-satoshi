Well if you want to look at the past 2013 performance we started at around 10, and ended up at around 1k, so 100k should be the target.
Although I agree with you past performance should not be used to predict  da future one, so I would stick at 10k.

Based on my study, It's not an easy task to run an ebay-like site (yet).
First of all, the income is not that high to cover up the site fees, programming fees, DDOS prevention (based on the sales number I've seen from Bitmit sales, they're ranging in the round of 5000 USD / month).
Also, a considerable % of this income is coming from cryptocurrency exchange and exchanging from Bitcoin to Paypal and other money forms, which opens up the problem of running a money transmitter business without having any licence (in or out of USA).
Best of luck for

No, Bitpay forwards the payment received, after few hours to the address of the merchant.
They don't keep it in the address you paid to.

Here is a safe way (without the need of any software).
1 - Go to 
2 - Go offline (disable your network, or even better, save the page &gt;&gt; CTRL+S and then move the page to some safer computer the rarely or never connected to the internet)
3 - Choose Paper Wallet and then check the "BIP38 Encrypt" option and check "Hide Art"
4 - Put a password for the "BIP38 Encrypt", a not very complex one (but not so obvious that you can always remember) and then generate.
5 - Print the address(es) generated
6 - Go to Blockchain.info, create an account, and in the import / Export add the address as WATCH ONLY
7 - Go to Coinbase and send like $2 to this newly created address.
8 - Try to spend like $1 of this $2 (just to test that you got it all right)
9 - Send the remaining Bitcoins to this address.

I'm one of those merchants who keeps their sales in bitcoins.
I do need Bitpay for that, otherwise I'd have to code my own program to create a new address everytime and then check if everything is working well, and after few transactions, sweep all the amounts received to a new address.
Bitpay does all of this for the merchant, for free, and at the end of every day, they forward me the btc to my address.
So why bother?

If this way of thinking is valid, then Google should have initiated a "search fee" in the early 2000 when its search market started booming.
Instead of upgrading their servers, they should have charged a search fee.
Do you think this would have played out well for them?

I'd vote against it.
Here is why.
In 28 years, you'd be leaving your son with either nothing or some super high wealth.
Based on my experience, leaving someone with the big amount of money and without any major money management tool for his net worth is a sure way for failure.
There is a reason on why most of lottery winners end up poor again.
Here is why:
 - An employee and managing few thousand dollars, does not know how to invest "and use" few million dollars.
 - A small millionaire does not know how to manage a 200 million dollar amount.
(leave alone few billion dollars)
Each networth is so much different than the other and needs a totally new view of the world.
In short, in 28 years you'd be giving your son either: 
 - A billion dollars that he won't know what to do with other than buying few Ferraris 
 - or you're leaving him with nothing.
This is exactly why Warren Buffet and Bill Gates are not leaving their children all of their billions.
They're only leaving "enough to do something, but not enough to do nothing"

I know there is no direct relation, but with the halving coming, there might be a possibility of transaction spike, media attention, any major price movement (similar to nov 2013) might lead to transactions doubling. 
So my question, if SegWit is not deployed, we are we ready? Do we have a plan B?
Or maybe as luke-jr said it's unlikely to happen anyway?
@_date: 2016-03-16 11:36:14
No one is saying that the blocks will be halving. 
All I'm saying is that we should be prepared for any serious spikes in transactions (it might be for any reason, halving might be one), same way Amazon prepares for their Christmas season (buying more servers ahead and being ready for heavy transaction loading).
If they put their head in the sand and act that it's "unlikely" will undoubtedly let them lose market share to competitors.

First words that came to mind: Is Bitcoin ready to handle any surge in newcomers?
@_date: 2016-03-16 07:56:10
Exactly my point from this post. It's always responsible to be prepared and have a plan B and and to be clear about it. Unfortunately asking for it is called "trolling" here.
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:13:06
Many tried.
I'm one of them.
The seller was very reluctant into selling it, I guess he was afraid of "who is" buying it and what's he's going to do with it.
Considering that it had a good reputation, and was trusted by users, it would have been a valid fear.

Serious question: how came this money is not followed and blocked.

Agree, but you're talking 10 or 20 years from now.

So if an institution bought a huge sum of calls on BTC it will not have any effect on the price?
Am I getting it right?
@_date: 2016-09-29 14:20:34
Depends on what's the reason for anonymity.
If your 25000 source is from stolen bitcoins (bitfinex for example), then it's not easy to cash out without being notified. The addresses are being watched and followed.
Furthermore, 25k bitcoin is around 15 million dollars, not an easy amount to sell or use by "spending some bills" or buying a luxury $100k car.
If the source is clean, I would say your best bet is the OTC.

It makes sense, you can't find consistently 1000+ sellers every day, day in &amp; day out (keep in mind that Gemimi is not international yet, so most of those are US sellers / buyers). But what Gemimi is doing, is a good thing: helping big sellers sell and big buyers big without creating some big price waves.

Currently I'm buying all cash (with my current investments), I'm planning to do the same with the btcs once I decide to sell.
I don't like banks, I don't like loans, in fact I'm debt free now.
But to answer your question, I don't think any bank will accept Bitcoins as liquid assets, unless you convert them to cash beforehand or you're making a seller financed deal.
I have also read some place that bitpay can help with transactions like these (convert to cash and send directly to the seller), but I have no experience with it. If someone has any experience with that, I would really like to know.

No, they asked me for those things, I read the FBI indictment and what they stated about the KYC. The KYC part was totally wrong (based on what I experienced).
Considering that I have applied to multiple exchanged, I would rate the BTC-e kyc as average, not super strict but not negligent too.
@_date: 2015-11-02 05:15:05
Even if he did, that's not the point.
The main point is having 3 major finance magazines having "Bitcoin" on their front page in the same month.
Something you would have dreamed of 2 years ago.
Now the dream is becoming a reality, Bit by Bit.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:28:10
First of all, BTC-e did some kyc on their accounts, I was asked at one point to send an ID and a proof of address.
Furthermore, if Wells Fargo or BOA was deemed to be implicit in some big money laundering operation and the FBI decides to shut down the bank don't you believe that they would refund the money to the people that were not involved in the laundering operation? or you expect them take all the banks' deposited money regardless?
I don't want the sound like I'm defending BTC-e  that's why I called them criminals, money launderers... but not because maybe they were all those things that we allow the FBI to confiscate all the depositors money.
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:37:07
Moral of the story, BTC-e (criminals, money launderers...) is still willing to refund me my balance, whereas the FBI was willing to take it all for themselves... in the name of justice!
