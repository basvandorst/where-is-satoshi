Ugh, I guess I need to start looking into altcoins...I can't believe that these seemingly intelligent individuals all want to keep Bitcoin limited as opposed to opening up its potential.  Hopefully these upgrades work to improve the network but I'm going to start investing elsewhere until blocks get bigger.
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:44:26
I completely agree with you.  I'm in the BIP101 camp because of those blog posts from Gavin and Mike, they're the only things I've seen that clearly laid out what is going on and how to address it.  Gavin and Mike wrote clearly and professionally about how to handle this debate and I'd love to see something similar from the core devs.
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:51:14
That's good to hear, so it's not necessarily a service that will be provided by one company, but many nodes working together?
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:03:23
No, I mix Soylent at home with restaurant food when I'm out and about, but I eat it exclusively when I'm at home.  It's surprisingly tasty and after consumption I feel energized, alert and full!  I actually have encouraged my friends to try it and every one of them have started buying it after trying it.  100% success rate.  What else do you want to know?
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:14:13
I would agree with you if the other intelligent guys (Gavin, Garzik, Hearn) also thought we should pump the breaks on increasing block size...Frankly I've been a bigger follower of Gavin over the past 3 years, so I tend to lean more towards his viewpoints because he explains himself so well.  It doesn't help that the Theymos is on that list...I can't support someone who has chosen to manipulate the discussion about block size to fit his own beliefs.

I like this plan, very well thought out and informative, let's do it!
@_date: 2015-12-06 06:48:10
Thats a bold prediction, let's hope you're right!
@_date: 2015-12-25 03:43:59
Haha, that's exactly what happened, Merry Christmas bitches!

I'm a BIP101 supporter.  I know I don't have an official vote, but I'd be happy to compromise to this.  I just want Bitcoin to continue on the path that Satoshi started and for this community to get back to working together.
@_date: 2015-12-10 00:54:47
I agree, it is unlikely, but I also think that maybe Satoshi actually was right under our noses, letting the network grow, while trying to stay out of the spotlight.  I can't imagine how intense it might've been being Bitcoin's visionary and starting to see people use it for drug transfers online in 2011.  Maybe he thought that the world needed a clearer understanding of what bitcoin is before he was willing to reveal himself, considering he probably wanted to avoid getting sentenced like Ross or Shrem by governments ignorant to his brilliance.  And now that there are a lot of different opinions about scaling bitcoin, some more useful than others, I think it's possible he wants to make sure bitcoin can continue to grow (especially considering how much stake he has in seeing it's price increase)
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:05:26
No, they recently managed to catch up on backorders
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:19:22
Hopefully bitcoin will perform awesomely these coming years, we need a cryptocurrency to work, and bitcoin currently has the best chance.  But since we can't seem to address the scaling issue without introducing workaround after workaround I'm not going to pour tens of thousands more into it until permanent long-term solutions are put into place.  I just need other assets to invest in.
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:05:10
Unless they just removed it it should be there...I've been buying with bitcoin for the past 6 months.
@_date: 2015-12-06 07:07:30
Whoops, sorry!
@_date: 2015-12-16 07:27:31
And my Axe!  I agree completely, let the market decide.
@_date: 2015-12-10 00:38:16
So you don't think we'd listen to his guidance if he has a clear vision for improving bitcoin?

I hear it's the healthier option, less tar :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:09:46
BUT I have given in-person acquaintances between 5-10$ just for downloading a wallet to their phones.  So that counts for something, right?

I guess it's just easier to dismiss technology you don't understand...Those commenters are going to look back on these $350 days as could've would've should've moments that they missed out on.  All the signs were there...
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:08:00
I haven't yet, but I plan on getting changetip setup tomorrow and hitting other subreddits..I want to get r/lego into it..lots of builders/artists sharing their work, makes sense to tip them!

@_date: 2014-12-05 02:11:52
Hey, thanks!  Much appreciated :)
@_date: 2014-08-22 21:20:44
Yes, Lego has normal retail sets ranged $1-150 that sit on shelves at Wal Mart, Target, TRU, etc.  BUT they also have $100-400 sets that are "exclusive"  Some of those sets can be found at Amazon (but never discounted) but I like to buy my large sets in stores so that I can make sure the box is in pristine condition.  Once the Lego Store takes Bitcoin, I'll be a happy camper :)
@_date: 2014-12-25 04:24:44
Yes!  Merry Christmas!  I'm thankful for this community and I can't wait to spend 2015 with you guys and gals!!
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:00:28

STRANGE MUSIC!
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:23:17
I could be laughably wrong, but I'm thinking that we'll probably be sub-600 in mid 2015.  There are enough positive things happening in the ecosystem (new products/services) that I think the value of the bitcoin network will being increasing significantly faster.  
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:05:23

Just creeping down...at this rate I think you might be right!

I guess this is why we're still "Early Adopters" and $350 is "Cheap" :D

Absolutely love breadwallet!  I make all of my friends download it!  Thank you!! 1 dollar @_date: 2014-09-09 21:04:37
Sadly, people pay fees without flinching every day...I'm just excited that the phone-to-pay technology will be so aggressively marketed to people, so that way Bitcoin will be a software update (or app) away from integrating.  Badass!
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:43:56
Haha, I know this is just a random speculative post...But I do enjoy the price discussion.  I actually very much agree that well probably have another significant spike...I'm just not sure if its coming in the next 6 months...but I like your take :)

Now I'm conflicted, considering that a lot of people think the creator of SR should be praised for being an innovator, will the publics attitude about Karpeles change?

This is a good use case for storing some BTC with Coinbase/Circle, some on your mobile phone, some on your computer and some on paper wallets...it spreads out your single point of failure and prevents something like this from having a huge impact.  I'm sorry about your loss though, that sucks :(
