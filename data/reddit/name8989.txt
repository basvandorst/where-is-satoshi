Stefan talked about way more than bitcoin, and he is insane. Not saying he should be banned though. And I don't know what he was banned for.

Awesome work! 
The point is your results highlight some users to look into. That's useful. 
Ignore the people upset they are on the list. 
If this was truly just bad research no one would comment negatively, they would just ignore it. People come to whine because the research is good enough to be threatening to real sock puppets.
