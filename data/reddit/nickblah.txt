If proof of work didn't cost money,  then what would stop an adversary from overtaking the network? The word *work* is kind of important.

I use Coinbase.   I don't use their weekly buy option though.

Considering bitcoin can't be uninvented,  I'm not too worried about that.   I'm 24 so I have a ways to go. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:39:28
It's 2013, not 2014.

You're a troll

I'm just speculating here but the price started rising before dish network made its announcement.   So I'm wondering if maybe the big hot shots at dish bought in before, knowing that the news would drive prices up. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:46:56
Bitcoin cannot be uninvented.

Haha don't feed the trolls 
@_date: 2014-06-26 21:44:30
I like how you called it smart money.   We should be using that term instead of  cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:59:20
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:14:27
Seems like Coinbase is going to be the next paypal for bitcoin.   They're handling the processing for a lot of companies these days. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 23:22:22
i think this will raise the price of btc.  if its not profitable for miners then miners will hold back on selling causing less supply therefore raising prices, thus making it profitable again.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:32:03
i want to see a game like WoW with cryptocurrency as in game money.
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:20:42
that's your fault brah
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:05:29
You say its more profitable but you fail to realise that if people lose in bitcoin then all that extra profit you were trying to make will be worthless.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:50:53
I have used them for about a year now.  Great service. Only thing that could be better is the time it takes to receive bitcoin after you buy them. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 07:28:34
I would even help fund this.
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:26:18
You have the same problem with credit card numbers.   I don't think people memorize that either. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:55:15
Bit licenses are a joke.   It makes it unnecessarily more difficult for businesses to accept it.   Please fix this. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 07:41:10
What about exchanging GHs/BTC?  I think if something is to compete with CEX.io then it would need to be at least equally intuitive.
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:51:45
Just pick a day.   Small price variations now won't make a big difference when the price reaches four figures. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:19:10
Does this mean 90 million dollars worth of bitcoin will be bought? 
@_date: 2014-12-29 00:09:54
well the last date on the year scale is the 21st.  It appears the bitbowl hasn't been accounted for yet.
@_date: 2014-12-29 17:31:35
Bitcoin 1.0 isn't even released yet. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 21:45:11
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:47:09
Anyone have an idea on how the bitcoins were seized specifically?
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:57:29
if you think it should be more then buy more.  its not math, its people, people like you.
@_date: 2014-06-22 12:37:42
@_date: 2014-06-20 22:22:43
Its not a matter of percentages,  its a matter of the longest block chain.   The longest one is believed to be the valid chain. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:52:27
I don't see why this is valuable info
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:10:33
Bitcoin would be the least of our worries. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 07:44:37
Do you have a website link? Also, will it be a publicly traded company that I could invest in?
@_date: 2014-12-28 23:50:07
I would presume so.  what bitcoin needs is some good advertisement.  Visa, MasterCard, and western union do it.  so why not bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-24 02:57:04
I'm sure the same can be said about USD 
@_date: 2014-06-15 23:04:18
Well for one, you don't need to trust anyone with your CC info so there's worry of hidden fees and there's no need to worry about Dish being hacked.

@_date: 2014-06-27 21:24:48
Last year,  would it really make a big difference if you bought at 130 vs 140?  Dont worry about the small changes.   Just buy and go long. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:48:53
@_date: 2014-06-20 01:59:15
They just tweeted about it.
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:51:21
cex.io is what adds to the mining power.  what we need is a site like that run on p2pool.  that would encorage people to buy and sell mining power by the GHs as if it was a comodity on an exchange.  does anyone know if anything like this could happen?  and what would be the startup costs for doing so?
@_date: 2014-12-28 23:51:40
If the bitcoin St Petersburg bowl can do this then imagine what a super bowl advertisement can do...

It might be the guy claiming he could double spend and this is the rewad rhe paid the miners to mine for him.

I laugh in irony because i know that this will be used as ammunition against bitcoin by anti-bitcoiners.

I don't understand why this was upvoted for something we've been aware of since bitcoin was created. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:22:38
Do you accept bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:16:34
Valid point but consider the consequences if we don't. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:58:28
Didn't they already do this like 2 years ago? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:33:26
Coinbase is about as legit as they get.  They are regulated and even insured is case things get salty.

1,  Never heard of you. 
2, I would like you more if you tipped me more than a few cents. 
3, I would dislike you if you tipped me less than a few cents.

Namecoin......  nobody talks about that anymore but that is intended exactly for that

People don't understand that a blockchain has to be tied to a currency. Otherwise there is no incentive for miners to verify the blockchain record.

Idk why do you have my phone didn't ring you later on today and the next time you have my room is it was in my life with you guys doing tonight or not to use it to do it again and again and again just got back home and the kids to do it again and I'm so confused right now but it's all the kids to your room tomorrow night at work today so I'm going to be picked out to be a while ago and I don't know

This is me trying harder. 
1,  same as above. 
2, can't say anything positive considering I've never heard of you. 
3,  tipping people a few cents seems like a cheap way to gain publicity. 
Is that any better?
