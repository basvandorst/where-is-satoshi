We are all ok with KYC, IDs, proof of residency blood work, selfie, whatever, as long as it is before they accept our deposits, not after, not with the hostage situation, not like that..I don’t use exchanges that take hostages, use Kraken, they have clear tiers and they will lock your funds immediately after deposit if it comes from a tainted address, simple and clear. Bitfinex and Bittrex are crap with their hostage taking strategy, stay away!

Just keep doing what you are doing, these moves were obviously a precursor to this two big drops of the past 12 hours. Next time this happens we should buy some protection on bitmex. Is it over now or there are more of these big drops before this guy finishes cashing out?

How do they know you have any?

What people fail to understand is that when you use a mixer you are not getting a bitcoin with no history, you are getting a bitcoin with someone else’s history, stop and consider for a moment how dangerous this can be. It could be a bitcoin last used by criminals or even terrorist. You want to be anonymous use zcoin or dash. Bestmixer.io gamma pool claims that the bitcoins you receive are “responsibly sourced” but unless you do chainanalysis on them there is no way of knowing for sure, you need trust, and trust is in short supply. Be careful out there!

How do you know you aren’t getting tainted bitcoins or even your own bitcoins back when using wasabi?

So, you are saying this is chainanalysis proof? Is there a video or article that explains how wasabi achieves this level of privacy?

It seems Digitec and Galaxus are not accepting crypto anymore, no press release, no note on the site, nothing. I hear it simply disappeared.

No really, use a pseudonym with a protonmail account

I keep two ledgers with the same words, clones, it always a good idea to have an easy backup, you can always erase, update and restore without interruption
