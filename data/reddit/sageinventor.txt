Right. But what would you buy with them? I would buy a pet octopus.

If you are going to use anybody, use an established exchange.

That news article **does** contain the word bitcoin. Also, it says usually.

Go and look at the amount of comment karma he has. Then complain.

Very good point. I feel like it could go either way. What future do you see in litecoin and others? Do you think that the world of cryptocurrency will revolve around a base of Bitcoin with a sprinkling of random currencies? If so, then why? What does having diversity in types of money do for the cryptocurrency economy?

Thanks. PM me his skype username.

Hopefully they ship fast then! Thanks!

I suppose this is true. I do wonder how cheap data will be in the future though.

I actually **just** found that after typing the previous comment. But thanks!

How exactly do I go about adding it to the list on the bitcoin wiki? I made an account an the email just wont show up....
@_date: 2013-07-17 20:42:37
The humble ebook bundle. It was basically just for me to see how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:54:54
Congrats on your cakeday. Must be an old person now. What knowledge of bitcoin you must possess!
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:48:43
hm. well interesting. So would this be able to be put into action with the current Bitcoin, or will Bitcoin be changed drastically? Do you think this is a job for Bitcoin, or will another coin become the new standard with this 2 layer, lite-node type of thing? The only reason I ask is because I have heard of Bitcoin being compared to MySpace before. Do you think that the comparison holds true?

Only facebook, sorry.

Cool stuff!

Very cool website, and even better, I just made some bitcoin!

Thank you very much kind sir. I will use these bitcoins well.
@_date: 2013-07-21 05:10:41
You don't.
@_date: 2013-07-29 03:57:05
I suppose they could, but I am looking for a receiving card anyway! Thanks for the info.

What would YOU do with 6000BTC?

Exactly. That's a great way to put it.

That's a lot of crazy stuff. The front page is littered with random everything.

I was going to make a custom receive card, so that won't be much of a problem for me, but I will remember it next time! Thanks!

I'm not saying storage will be infinate, just much cheaper as time progresses. There is a point when storage becomes impossible to shrink more, yes.
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:46:03
Who ended up doing it?
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:33:31
I think that the light-node idea is great, but how does this get implemented in the future? How can one only know parts of the block chain? Electrum is a light client, but the client still has access to the entire block chain. How, then do you create something like what you suggest?
@_date: 2013-07-13 06:31:05
I dont plan to. I just wonder how exactly 10 different versions of bitcoin pop up. Someone has to know how.
@_date: 2013-07-31 15:10:19
*Bows* Thanks. I try.
@_date: 2013-07-31 02:49:18
Enjoy the tiny amounts of bitcoin! :) After all, its what this community is about! (Litecoin tip now anybody?)
@_date: 2013-07-23 15:43:06
And this allows for the buyer to submit a shipping address with the payment?
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:21:07
ah. quite so. Well said.

But who cares. When computers are going quantum, storage will be so cheap it won't matter.

where would I find information on goldcoin? google is no help.
