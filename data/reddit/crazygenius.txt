Just curious, why do you trust someone else to hold your precious metals for you? Do you also hold your BTC somewhere other than a personal wallet or cold storage?

Looking for some help with splitting from my mycelium wallet. I used my 12 word seed to restore a BCC wallet with Electron cash, but at the split I had my BTC in an secondary HD wallet created that states it can be restored with the same 12 word seed. When restoring in electron cash I only see history and bcc for the primary wallet and none of the others.

after this was brought up i did a little google searching and there are very few, very small, kinda scammy looking sites. We need large sites with significant income to properly get it started. Can't say which sites as i pirate all my pirate porn.

This makes the first bitcoin transaction in sapce a possibility! I believe this was attempted already with an astronaut, but it is illegal for him as an employee of NASA to receive private money as a public employee (dont quote me exactly on that). Now we need someone to not only pay for their flight with bitcoin, but to receive a bitcoin payment while in space! Makes me wish I got in at the beginning, as if I was a bitcoin millionaire this would likely be the first thing I spent my money on.

Honestly, however humorous this was meant to be, its the truth. All we need to do now is start lobbying porn sites to accept bitcoin and they may be the mainstrean exposure needed to convert the everyman, as I can imagine this would be an excellent way to hide porn charges on ones account. Just my 2 bitcents.

coinbase is instant after verification, made several purchases but they added needing a CC# in addition to everything, fuck me for not wanting to have credit cards as debit arent accepted. so if you have a CC sign up for coinbase. W/o verification there is a 4 day delay but the value is taken at time of purchase.
