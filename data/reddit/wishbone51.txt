Thanks.. Maybe I'll just do the conversion in Coinbase.

Don't keep your private key in an online service is the main one.

Any random hacker can't take anything if you apply reasonable measures to keep your assets safe.

Do you know how it does the conversion? And what the peers are for? I can't find any documentation on it.

I zip up PDFs of paper wallets, some used, many not used yet, and passphrases for the mobile wallets I use into a file, then encrypt that file with a paraphrase that I will never forget.
I keep a copy of this file on my phone, all my computers, and in the cloud.
My stuff is secure, but easily accessible, and will never be lost.

For USD, Coinbase is FDIC insured (up to $100K), and they say their bitcoin is insured as well.
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:05:39
How much does one BTC weigh?
@_date: 2018-10-06 21:43:20
I have PDF files of my paper wallets, along with my wallet pass phrases all in a zip file that is gpg symmetrically encrypted (pass phrase), with a copy on my phone, laptop, desktop, and in the cloud.
Secure, and easily accessible. Not exactly cold storage, but not in an active wallet and the encryption is safer than someone accidentally landing on my private key.

It's generally frowned upon for two reasons.
1) Anonymity: People can see what you are doing more when you re-use an address.
2) Once you expose your private key to connected software, anything can happen.
Partial spend from a paper wallet is frowned upon for the above two reasons, and also the fact that unless you know that your change is returning back to the paper wallet, you might lose your change.
Mycelium has a cool "paper wallet spend" feature where you can scan a private key, spend, and it returns the change back to the paper wallet. It works good, but if you have a trojan on your phone looking at your camera, you could expose your private key.
With that said, if your computer, phone, network, and internet is not compromised, and you know what you're doing, it's perfectly safe to re-use a paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-27 07:20:36
PigeonCoin would be a good example.

That's about USD $0.22, if I'm reading this correctly?
I'm in a good mood. I'll send it to you. What's your public address?
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:59:19
Its pretty easy as is to create a paper wallet.

When you purchase, you scan their QR code. Have you done this before?

That was a brilliant scam of a scammer. I love messing with scammers, but the "inspect element" HTML edit idea was brilliant.

It's just a cartoon, dude. You're reading too much into it.
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:37:01
Even if you move a bit of it, it's all gone, until change is made and returned to that address or another. Still stressful
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:03:39
I use coinbase to purchase bitcoin, but transfer it to offline storage. Don't keep it in an exchange. If hacked, you won't get it back.
Look up guides online for best security practices

@_date: 2018-10-14 01:02:54
How much is the service charge? Or do they use an exchange rate that is a percent off their official rate?
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:09:26
I would
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:18:55


What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2018-10-03 10:16:57
PayPal and others are instant.
Not dissing bitcoin, but it has a ways to go before it's competing with centralized solutions.
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:12:54
That's deep
@_date: 2018-10-27 07:30:05
What was the exchange rate you used for your deal?
@_date: 2018-10-27 07:15:32
How did you receive your coins?
@_date: 2018-10-13 23:29:33
I would much rather use Coinbase. This isn't even anonymous since they require your phone number, and are taking video of you.
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:30:35
Did you ever scan your private key with a QR code reader on your phone?
I also keep paper wallets on my computer, but encrypt the files themselves. Whenever I decrypt them, it is to a RAM drive, which disappears when done
@_date: 2018-10-24 06:32:00
I like it.
Would a comments section of each article be too much fluff?

I've never kept anything on coinbase. I buy, then move it off to a wallet I manage, or a paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-07 10:47:48
I heard that their USD accounts are FDIC insured as well, which is a pretty good deal.
I just wish I could purchase BTC and habe it go directly to an external wallet, or sell from one.
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:24:53
No. The blockchain only has the public address. No way to generate the private key from that (yet)

@_date: 2018-10-19 03:06:27
Ok. What was the exchange rate that the seller specified? It's very possible you got a bad rate, and got all the bitcoin you agreed to.
@_date: 2018-10-27 07:26:42
username checks out
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:26:09
The reason I use Coinbase is that any USD I happen to have in my account is FDIC insured. Digital currency is also insured in case of a breach, which wouldn't be an issue if I could purchase directly into a personal wallet, but is nice to know.
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:36:02
That's not what I did there. If BTC is viable and USD is not, then BTC might become the standard.
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:27:16
"CryptoLamboMerch processes all orders in US Dollar. 
While the content of your cart is currently displayed in Bitcoin, you will checkout using US Dollar at the most current exchange rate."
That's what I see when I go to check out.

@_date: 2018-10-25 18:53:12
I think it's silly they have that fee on top of the poor exchange rate.
@_date: 2018-10-07 01:46:54
It kinda sucks that there are two fees. The horrible exchange rate with the fee on top
@_date: 2018-10-19 03:10:03
Does he need any more than an QR code address on a wall pointing to his wallet? Tell customers to scan the code and send X amount of BTC. I don't see the need for a tablet POS system.

I wish Coinbase would allow us to purchase BTC and send it directly to a personal wallet. Would also be nice to sell directly from a personal wallet as well.

From our private conversation, you are being scammed. Don't let them create an account for you anywhere, and that site is a scam site. Don't accept bitcoin for anything, until you figure out what you are doing.

When you're in a good mood and have more BTC, you can send me back 0.0000545 (included the mining fee I sent) to the address that sent it to you.
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:40:31
I converted all my BCH to ETH ... I was surprised that the mining fee for BCH was $0.01, but it took 1.5 hours to confirm. ETH mining fee was $0.08, and took 5 mins.

I don't see where I can pay with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-18 07:05:18
A lot of stories about BoA and their policy and their view that BTC payments are "troubling".
Not allowing CC purchases is the new normal, but BoA is closing bank accounts used to purchase crypto.
Sound like they're scared.

Wouldn't a donation be more valuable in fiat, rather than pay high ATM fees and poor exchange rate?
Unless it's the type of site where "donations" need to be anonymous?
