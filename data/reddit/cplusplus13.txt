I guess that would depend greatly on what he is studying in school...

I’m not sure how you could even argue that Bitcoin isn’t exactly like the internet bubble. The internet bubble did burst, causing a lot of worthless stocks to lose practically all value. And even though all internet stocks did lose value in the short term, the top companies killed it in the long run. Look at Amazon and Google now! Both of them were hurt bad by the bubble in the short term, but have killed it since then. Internet companies that made it through that time period are enormous profit machines now. 
The situation in cryptocurrency isn’t really any different at all. If you think there isn’t going to be a similar bubble bursting, look at what has happened in the last month... A lot of these overvalued shitcoins are eventually going to fail. But there will be some big winners too. Bitcoin is likely going to be a winner in the long term, so even though it will be cut in price big time by these kinds of major corrections, in the long term it should kill it just like Amazon and Google have.

First of all, not all companies return dividends to shareholders. Amazon is a great example of this. It’s one of the largest market cap companies in the world, and it doesn’t pay a dividend at all. So in that regard Amazon’s stock price could be considered speculative. 
Next, cryptocurrencies absolutely serve practical purposes beyond speculation. Bitcoin doesn’t do much besides hold value, but there are MANY other coins and projects that have real world uses and serve many purposes besides speculation. 
So if you think companies are valuable because of their dividends, and that cryptocurrencies have no use besides speculation, you should do a little more research.
