We're constantly working to improve the security of the platform and that's going to be done as soon as we have a reasonable solution for it. At this stage it's not a problem, but it does cause some browsers to alert our users that we have content which is not served over HTTP.

Our highest priority is your security! The issues being described here are unrelated to the compromise of our website in the beginning of the month. We would kindly ask that you respond via the support system in order for us to properly provide you with assistance.

Thank you for reporting the issue. We've done an internal investigation and this appears to be a client-side issue. The video seems to show a compromise of the client's clipboard, which may be due to a malicious browser plugins or other malware on the client's computer. We have not received any other reports of the same problem.  
All of our content is being served through HTTPS, with the exception of some images. We're serving some of the images via HTTP for performance reasons. The threat of an MITM attack is very low in that case. The issue reported is highly unlikely to result in a compromise of the website or any users.

The BTC address bar-codes are served via HTTPS. The only content we serve via HTTP are the avatars. Again, this has no impact on the issue you're reporting and we would kindly ask that you follow-up via the support system.

Already did, but we give you props for the effort! ;)

I don't know their buyer policies. I was just speaking as customers looking to get discounts on merchandise from amazon, and it has worked extremely well for us. No problems whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:59:59
15% might be a bit too high. We have purchased many items for work and we normally pick the 10% discount. Over 30 items ordered and only one wasn't received, because it was out of stock.

That seems like a huge difference...


And demand for Bitcoin companies is notably down.


I don't buy the analogy. At best, you're speculating on the success of YC companies. I would be more convinced if we had real statistics.  


That's just anecdotal evidence from a guy who literally says that he invested indirectly as tiny to small crowd investor. Again, I'd love to see real statistics, otherwise you and I are just speculating on what two guys are saying on Quora. Hardly valuable.  


Sure, neither Boost nor Bitcoin is benefiting from lower demand from VCs, but that doesn't mean that there is a lower quality within Boost or Bitcoin companies in general. You said that Boost invests in second rate companies and misses on first rate deals like OpenBazaar. Did OpenBazaar ever try to get into an accelerator of any sort, let alone Boost? Was OpenBazaar even an opportunity for Boost?  


You're saying that the raise size and valuations are bigger, but in no way does that mean that it's actually easier to raise the capital. It could be that the round size and valuation are related to the increased cost of running a startup these days.  Is there really any statistical evidence that startups are having an easier time in raising capital?  


The school you went to actually matters when you're applying for a job and you have nothing else to show for. However, hardly anybody cares what accelerator you went to when you start fundraising. Fundraising is all about getting the right intro and Boost has an excellent network of founders.  


Again, the fact that there is higher seed valuations does not mean that it's easier to raise capital :). The higher valuations could easily be attributed to a higher operational cost. Engineers in the Bay Area can easily cost you $200K per year. If you want to have 10 engineers and a burn rate of one year, then you'll need $24 million USD. Again, nothing indicates that it's actually fundamentally easier to raise the capital now.

I think that's the point of being selective: you have a hard time finding quality companies.


I have no clue what you're trying to say here.


It's laughable, because that's not what I said. :) A seed company does not hire engineers, most of the companies looking for seed money are comprised of founders. But that's why they're getting seed funding: they need to be able to hire engineers. So when a company gets $2M seed funding, what do you think they do? Do you think they go back in their parent's basement and keep working, or do they get an office and hire engineers? Do they go out there and pay below-market rate for engineers? I think the answers to these questions are pretty obvious.
There are hundreds of startups in the Bay Area and they all pay market rates for engineers + equity. The average salary of a startup engineer in the [Bay Area is $136K]( And that's the average, but the first few hires are rarely average. Most startups look for extremely talented and proven engineers that can help lead the company and those cost quite a bit more than the average engineer. If you notice, I said that it costs the company $200K, not that they're paying $200K to the engineer. 
**But all of the above is just hand waving. You have yet to show any objective evidence that it is actually easier to raise cash now.**
* You have ignored the fact that Boost's investment thesis is vastly different from the cookie-cutter YC.  
* You have stated that YC is more selective, which is hardly a surprise if you look at the investment thesis. Yet, Boost is still quite selective, with a reported 4% acceptance rate.  
* You have said that Boost's performance is bad, because they pick bad companies. Again, ignoring the fact that they're investing in companies which are in an inherently more risky sector and completely different from that of YC.  
* You said that an example of Boost missing a deal was OpenBazaar, but YC didn't invest in them either. To top it off, did OpenBazaar ever try to be in any accelerator? How can an investor miss a deal which was never there to begin with?!  
* You said that valuations are higher and companies are raising more money, which in no way actually translates into startups having an easier time to get cash.  
Again, where is the evidence that it is actually easier to raise capital? Is there a study which confirms this or are you just going off tweets? Because I saw [the one hour presentation from Fred Destin]( he had tons of statistics from studies and in no way did they indicate that it's actually easier to raise capital. On the contrary, the norm seems to be that fundraising is very difficult!

What's the problem? That Bitcoin is simply not user friendly for the masses? I would look at this article to get a better understanding why remittance for the unbanked is a long shot with Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2015-10-02 14:49:07
It's by no means supposed to be easy. Raising money is always hard, even when people tell you it's easy. If it was so easy, then everybody would be doing it :).

An interesting blog post from SaveOnSend, which pretty much says the same thing (but with a whole lot more analytical evidence behind it): 
@_date: 2015-10-04 17:20:47
That's an apples and oranges comparison to begin with: YC and 500 startups invest into all kinds of startpus, whereas Boost invested in 100% Bitcoin companies last tribe. That's a fundamentally different investment thesis and the results are going to be fundamentally different. 
[The same question was posted on Quora]( and it seems like it's around 30-40%, despite one of the people that answered claiming 90-95% (which is super unrealistic). In general, the accelerators don't post these numbers, because the reality is just too harsh. Many of the startups in this Boost tribe were companies that didn't stay in the Bay Area, so they don't have the massive expenses and $500K means that they're going to be fine. Even Coinbase only raised $600K in their seed round after coming out of YC. So the measure should not be how much they raised, but did the companies raise enough capital to get them to the next round. I'd say that about 40% of the Boost companies did, which is in line with the stats we infer for YC.
I have no clue why you think it's any easier to raise capital now vs in the past. I don't even know how far back are you looking in order to make the comparison. 
Fred Destin, from Accel Partners, explained it the best: he gets 9000 emails per year and he only responds to about 2000. He jumps on a call with 200 of those and only about 80 of them continue to a further engagement. Out of those 80 or so, about 35 get to pitch the partners and they invest in about 5 **for the entire year**. You do the math: less than 0.25% of the companies that contact a VC will get funded! Luckily Fred Destin is not the only VC out there, but the good VCs are looking at similar statistics. I don't think those numbers have changed recently, I don't think VCs are receiving less mail, and I don't think they're funding more companies than they usually do.

Pretty obvious that I certainly wasn't hiding it. :)


Again, how did you make that assessment that money is easy? :) The fact that you keep repeating it does not make it true.


I would kindly ask that you share those charts with me. So far you've just given me tweets. 


There is nothing to feel for: we've raised enough money to last us for over a year and we're expanding our team. The fact that we haven't disclosed it is a different story.


Absolutely not. I think I was pretty clear: the seed company does not hire engineers, until they get their funds. When they get their funds they start hiring engineers. What else would they use the funds for?


What else would I be talking about?!?! So if I'm wrong, then give me the statistics which show the average salary for a Software Engineer in a startup in SF. Wait... nevermind, I already gave you those statistics, but you just conveniently glossed over them.  


Equity means nothing until there is an exit. Equity is nothing more than an IOU.


I live in SF and I see how much it costs, so I don't have to call them :). But just for you, I did call them and that what I'm personally seeing in SF is actually correct!  Again, you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about. 
At this point I'll just assume you're trolling me.

I don't doubt that YC is one of the best, if not the best accelerator out there. However, YC didn't invest in OpenBazaar either. YC's investment thesis is to invest in companies which fit a very well defined and proven mold (in the US). Boost, and specifically with Tribe 5, churned out companies that were 70% international by the very nature of Bitcoin. This is something that nobody else has done before, YC doesn't do it and it simply makes no sense to compare them. Boost is taking bigger risks. This is the same as investing in a more volatile asset, like Bitcoin.  


I would rather look at the real statistics, rather than some sensationalist tweets. But if you want to go off the tweets: Boost's acceptance rate is 4%, not quite the 1.5% at YC, but still Ivy League level and easily on par with Stanford/Harvard.


Seriously? Demand is increasing and that usually lowers the price??? Did you just really say that? Unless the supply is outpacing the demand, then you're very wrong! 


The same thing that's causing the salaries and the rent in the Bay Area to go up. There is a lot of competition in the space and it costs a lot more to run a startup. With $2M USD you will have a very hard time hiring 5 engineers, which cost an average of $200K each and still have money to acquire customers, keep an office space, pay your legal bills and so on... you will run out of money within 10 months. Why is an software engineer in the Bay Area making 2x what an software engineers in the mid-west are earning and 10x what a software engineer in Eastern Europe is earning? Why is rent 3x higher than in the mid-west and 10x higher than in Eastern Europe? Again, you're looking at very general statements and trying to draw conclusions.  
**All you've said is that it costs more money to run a startup in the Bay Area. You have not actually shown that it's any easier to get that money.**  


From those tweets, we gather that 114 YC W15 startups raised an average of 1.9M, whereas the average for a Boost startup is probably a quarter of that. Are most of the YC companies remaining in the Bay Area? If yes, then they'll need that 1.9M. Less than 30% of Boost companies remained in the US, so they can easily run with much less funding.  As a matter of fact, they can run with 1/5th of the funding that a Bay Area startup needs. With 100% Bitcon companies in Tribe 5 and most of the innovation needed **outside** of the US, this is no surprise. There are a large number of differences, which you are simply brushing over and generalizing. 


Because you're comparing apples and oranges, which was my reply right from the start. You're simply not accounting for how big of a difference we see in the investment thesis of the two accelerators.

Tribe 5 has a number of companies that already got VC funding. Two companies got more than $1 mil, 1 got $800K and a number of others received funding in the $500K range.
