Thanks for this. Been a long day so I've nothing to say atm but I appreciate the real talk.

You understood that I meant use cases I think, not the goofy Bitcoin vs BTC subs and their tribespeople. I've been into BTC for a long time but I never felt the need to be upset with the bcash fork. I just don't get it. Dogma isn't the future.

Ask your friend whether or not he or she has read the terms and conditions at PayPal dawt com
I use paypal, too
It's handy for moving sums &lt; 10k to friends and family for no fee (and pretty quick), but the fee is paid by accepting several caveats:
Every drop of analytics blood they can squeeze out of my usage of the service is going to be consumed and potentially traded (never sold you see) and if PayPal dawt com decides they don't like where I'm sending my money, it's basically not my money any more.
Pros and cons is all. Every model has them.

Why is there salt on either side? BCH has its place and BTC has its place what's the problem here? Not trolling just both sides have really picked their spots let's get on with it.

An unfair comparison imo; ethereum is more of a gifted child that doesn't know quite what it wants to do yet.
Edit: I thought I was contributing but it's cool, we don't have to agree

Massively overblown issue with crypto currencies. The device you're posting on did more harm coming into existence than an equivalent mining of btc would do, and your device doesn't safeguard many billions of deflationary wealth.
Unless it's running a BTC node.

Ether maybe overrated as a currency but ethereum has exceptional potential.

Lot of support for central banks in this thread.

This chart is kind of sad, but at least I'm still 'allowed' to Bitcoin a lot. 
I dunno, maybe my appetite for risk is a little lower than it used to be, but that's a feature of aging.
I'm still out here buying dips and dumps.

Two infusions
53 and 75 billions.
128 billion. Not 75.
Lots of folks in traditional circles blaming it on routine stuff or happenstance, timing wise, who seem unwilling to explain why this hasn't happened since 2008. Inverse yield curve. Liquidity issues popping up here and there.
The fed has a lot of hot air to blow into this balloon. 
Remains to be seen if it will be enough.

The overnight lending market doesn't have anything to do with the payday lending market, which is (I think) what you've confused it with.
It's in the article.
