I don't understand your comment.  The whole idea of this project is that restaurants get paid in dollars.  The project accepts Bitcoin/Ethereum on the restaurants behalf and pays them in dollars at that moment.  So there's no risk to the restaurant owner.
...or didn't you actually read about it before commenting?

Except then the restaurants need to understand how to set up a cryptowallet, fund it, trade, and whether the risks of hackers.  The whole point of this system is to eliminate that risk for the restaurants and make trading as simple as possible.  
Tether or Dai doesn't do that.

Except unlike Bitpay, you don't need to wait to have a card shipped to you and you don't need to pay $5 per ACH Debit.

In order to compete with the likes of Bitpay you need to offer alternative solutions and alternative ways of thinking.  Their fees make the entire process unworkable in this sector.  
If you want to compete you need a token to back it up.  It's just that simple.

Look at my history, they are certainly not all to Menubuzz.  Although I did create that to help answer questions and let people know about the project.  That's what you're supposed to do when setting up a project like this, create social media outlets for people to be able to respond and get feedback.

He has relocated to Europe for this, Portugal, agreed data needs to be updated. 
If there were only 5 connections that would be one thing, but 500+?  Different story.

Then the restaurant would have to have wallets for any and all of those, and also have to understand how to trade them.  You can't expect that from a Mom and Pa operation.  That's why so few restaurants accept Crypto.  The idea is to build a bridge between crypto payments and the restaurants so they can accept crypto without having to understand all the inner workings.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:50:57
Of course I have time, we built the product.  You know we are supposed to answer questions and comments online right?  That's how businesses use social media.  It's kind of the point.

Only stated my affiliation once people called me out?  You don't think people seeing I created would be enough?  If I were hiding I would have used a throwaway.  Keep trying though, troll.

I am part of the team, not a shill.  It took us a very long time to build this POS system and you're spreading FUD.  What would you have me do?  Just let you spread FUD without showing the truth?
So far you've said:
1) the ICO could be banned/blacklisted or could not get a bank account
-- Isn't true, they already have a bank account.
2) Risk to the owner of the restaurants not getting paid in US dollars.
-- Again isn't true, currency is translated into US dollars automatically upon transaction
3) They don't have a company and you could go to jail
-- Not true, they are incorporated in Ireland, a stable trading area
4) Scott Kirk is located in Brazil
-- Was true during incorporation, not true anymore.  So valid point, just not valid anymore.
Can you at least admit you were wrong about some of those?  
Now what about my points?
1) The system allows restaurants to accept crypto easily without  the knowledge of how to setup a wallet and trading, it also eliminates the risk as their account is credited in dollars.  Do you not at least like the idea?
2) Having a lawyer experienced in AML and KYC, a lawyer from NY, is actually a great thing for a project like this.
3) The concept for the POS system is a good one, even if you don't agree with the other aspects.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:59:54
Give me a break.  It's a finished product with a legitimate company.  You're just spreading FUD.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:13:39
Where exactly is the scam?  
I'm not a paid shill, I helped create the product (and I created Are we not allowed to comment on our work?

It's not the $50 restaurant bills we're worried about, it's the $500 and $1000 bar tabs.  If there's a risk of exploiting a system, someone will do it.  Thus Race attacks, Finney Attacks, Vector 76 , Majority attack, etc are all potential risks.  Ignoring those risks is something that's possible but it doesn't make them non-risks,
And once Bitcoin/Ethereum is in the MenuBuzz Cryptowallet, customer transactions fees are  $0.  How much are Bitpays transaction fees?
...and only in a few restaurants right now because we haven't done any advertising yet.  It's a new product thus the "beta" attached to the logo.  Not ideal, but you have to start somewhere.

Nothing wrong with being a smart-ass.  At least smart comes before ass. ;-)
First, you're thinking of the consumer not the restaurant and you're coming from the direction of an experienced user rather than someone with 0 knowledge.
For a restaurant to get setup from having no knowledge the amount of work required to do so is pretty overwhelming to the newbie.  Lots to learn, lots of FUD out there, and a lot of time needed.  MenuBuzz eliminates that time and removes the risk for the restaurants.  
So yes, there are other options, but none catered to restaurants &amp; bars, which is one of the reasons so few of them accept it.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:03:40
Have you tried converting cryptocurrency to FIAT?  If I wanted to pay with cash for a pizza i would have to wait to withdraw my currency to a bank, then withdraw the money from a bank machine.  The idea is to speed up that process so the customer can pay with crypto without the laborious process of having to withdraw funds first.
People don't need to pay with MenuTokens, they can also pay with Bitcoin and Ether.  We just store them in the system as Menu Tokens as it's more stable (avoids price fluctuations, no additional fees for multiple purchasesm and instantaneous payments).
This fulfills that need.  Otherwise Bitcoin payments in this space just aren't workable.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:20:42
Not even close, Tether doesn't have a product.
MenuBuzz is an entire system that allows individuals to order food &amp; beverages in restaurants.  It actually automatically converts the crypto to dollars for the restaurants so it minimizes the fears restaurants have of adopting Bitcoin as payment.  Now they don't need to understand the sometimes confusing/convoluted process of trading Bitcoin.  They don't have to worry about hackers stealing all their money.  That's all done in the MenuBuzz system.

You just think everything is lame, don't you?  Just looking at the negative things instead of any positive outcome.  I get the impression you think everyone who responds with facts that don't support your comments is somehow a "paid shill".  In this case you're very wrong again.  You need to lighten up a bit, not everything and everyone around you is a scam.  
...One thing I can say about you is you ask the important questions, things other people will want to know.  So thanks for that.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:43:59
Blank statement... why is it an ICO scam?  It isn't even an ICO.  I think you're commenting before actually understanding the project.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:10:08
Bitpay is totally unreliable for this, you really need to stop pushing it.
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:51:29
"MenuBuzz radically changed this by offering businesses a simple interface for their diners to order and pay with crypto which is converted and deposited into the merchants account in dollars.  "
Maybe you only picked out the part that supported your narrative instead of reading the whole thing?  The whole idea is businesses no longer have to understand how to trade Bitcoin before accepting Bitcoin.  All exchanges are done for them.  The dollar value of the transaction is automatically deposited into their account the moment the customer purchases and food or beverages.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:00:14
I think that's a good idea.  Maybe next time suggest it rather than being insulting.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:03:14
Seriously dude, you're need to read more.  In their white paper it says,
"This is the white paper of Guru Productions Limited, a company organised under the laws of Ireland, doing business as MenuBuzz, with its registered address at Unit 3D North Point House, North Point Business Park, New Mallow Road, Cork "
I spent the time to lookup the company in the Irish Registry too:
They have a product, they are in a stable region, and they are incorporated.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:46:29
Bitpay has a huge fees.
$5 per debit
$5 dormancy fees
$15 ACH decline
A $5 fee per debit is hardly useful when buying a $1 slice of pizza.  That's where our system excels, we eliminate those fees.

All I see is people making untrue claims void of facts.  You pushing Bitpay is the scam.  Considering you keep pushing them is telling.
If you keep promoting a known scam company your message message is lost.

His team isnt in Brazil and he isn't either.  That's where it was incorporated.  
For example, the chief legal advisor has experience in AML and KYC and is a certified lawyer in New York

Bitpay has a lot of troubles. 
You keep pumping them, are you trying to pump them because you have a vested interest?
and  coinbase charges HUGE fees. Totally impractical.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:33:54
Of course they see Crypto as a threat.  They charge $35-50 + huge exchange rates to do a money transfer.  That's even more than Bitcoin.
The problem with oligopolies, like the banks, is they raise fees so high, it's easy for a newcomer like blockchain tech to sweep the feet right from under them.  They should be scared.
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:33:43
Why exactly is that?
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:56:23
You know this is a full POS system as well right? That we take the tokens from the customers and convert them into dollars for the restaurant.  It's much more than just a token.  It's also not an ICO.
