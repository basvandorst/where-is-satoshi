They should create a "LBC Average" and list it on their front page of their website, similar to how Coinbase/Stamp/BTC-e do it. That way, people have a clearer idea of what coins are *actually* selling for, on average, for actual *real world* use, not just traders on an exchange or bots.
I actually think that this would have a good effect on price, as most LBC transactions are sold for a premium.

Actually, you're wrong. You are correct, there are 24/7 numbers to report lost/stolen cards...but those customer service agents can ONLY cancel cards. They have 0 authority to do ANYTHING else account related.
You remind me of the kind of guy that would point at a homeless guy screaming at himself on the street and say, "GET A JOB LOSER"
Yeah, because you know the whole story. You know it **all**.
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:40:21
No, no they wouldn't have. You are talking out your ass.
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:40:52
Uhh, precisely. I'm aware it is vicious and sick...hence why I said it.
Fuck that guy.
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:38:37
Except there is this little thing called "time difference".
If it was 8PM local time and he's from the EU, it's in the middle of the night where his bank is located and MANY banks customer service hours close well before this.
I've been in his shoes...but I like how you act like you know how it happened better than he does. You know, you being there and all..

The economic playing field is slowly being leveled.
No longer will the poor kid in Nigeria with massive potential be left out in the cold because he was born in the wrong place.
No longer will the lazy, worthless, mooch low-life that offers nothing to the world in the USA be able to get a decent paying job solely because he was fortunate to be born in a certain geographic location.
I love it. Those who deserve to thrive...will, regardless of where they are. Those who don't...well, won't.
It's going to take some years, but it's coming.

Bitcoin, in it's current form, is a lot more fragile than a lot of us would like to believe.
If I was a Billionaire, I'd put $2,000,000 towards a spam attack just because. Could you imagine the havoc if there was 100,000,000 unconfirmed transactions?
These current spam attacks are peanuts...and they are still seriously fucking with the useability of Bitcoin.
My Mycelium app was UNUSABLE for 4 hours earlier because the nodes they connect to were that jam-packed with spam.
Anyone who doesn't see the current fragility is deluding themselves.
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:26:49
According to them, they connect to random nodes.

Since when is posting an ad on Backpage illegal?
If that were the case, they would have indicted the owners of Backpage, not used their influence to unofficially have Visa/Mastercard stop transacting with them.
There is nothing illegal about selling coins to someone that is going to use it to post an ad on a website unless you KNOW it is being used for purposes of prostitution.
CoinCafe is afraid of "Operation Chokepoint"...not any OFFICIAL legal reasons.
(Google Operation Chokepoint...unbelievable shit)
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:12:37
Umm, the "worst" banks because they have policies that don't work well with your previous argument?
How convenient.
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:34:56
I think *you're* the one oversimplifying here with the "10 Million in research, 10 people need it." It never works that way in reality.
There's nothing wrong with profit...even on selling things that people desperately need. But there's profits...and then there's **profits**.
Some of the markups on a lot of these pharmaceuticals in the United States are *unbelievable*, even taking into account how much money it cost in research/development.
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:15:48
Yes, because all billionaires are brilliant, safe-made men that never waste time doing dumb shit.
You haven't known many wealthy people, have ya?

Know what else?
SARS are only required to be filed by a MSB for suspicious transactions over $2,000.00. These Backpage buyers are only buying &lt;$50 at a time to post their ads. Honestly, FinCEN would give zero fucks about Sallie Q Hooker paying for her ad in Bitcoin.
**Question to CoinCafe:** Are you asking prospective buyers WHAT SORT OF AD they are posting on Backpage? This *may* suffice as the "due diligence" required to absolve yourselves of the legal accountability for those that are using it for prostitution ads. If someone says they are using it to post an apartment ad, how do you know they are lying if there is no other information to refute their claim? *Maybe they actually are posting an ad for a legal service. Ever think of that?*
The truth of the matter is this: If you are selling Bitcoin at all, you are already funding illegal activity merely by the statistics. **Most** OTC buyers at this point in Bitcoin's life are using it for illegal shit. Plain and simple. It is the MSB's job to detect and prevent this sort of activity as best as they can...but even FinCEN admits preventing ALL money laundering isn't possible.
Like I said before, Operation Chokepoint, and banking policies like it, are the concern for CoinCafe here. Banks do risk assessments on their MSBs. If the bank where they hold accounts find out that they are conducting business with Backpage customers, legal/compliant or not, the bank could potentially close their accounts just because **that's what they do to Bitcoin MSBs.**
CoinCafe is between a rock and a hard place.
Source: I am a a registered MSB with an effective AML policy. The difference is, I do EVERYTHING over the counter...fuck banks. It's more expensive to do business without business accounts for your MSB, but it's BETTER than having the bank breathing down your neck for activity that is technically LEGAL.

Call the 24/7 number. Do it tonight at 3AM. Ask the person you speak to to unblock your card after it's been flagged. Then ask them to place a travel advisory on the card.
See what happens.
I am talking about American banks here. Maybe EU or AU is different.

I would quite literally tell the judge to suck my dick in open court.
No joke. 
Any prosecutor that would actually prosecute this sort of thing deserves life in prison.
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:36:39
Ahh, well then that makes sense.
Why only 3 nodes? Seems kind of stupid, no?
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:29:44
You lost this argument. Dear god....stop.

OMG this.

Actually in effect, they do force their hand.
Lobbyist influences Politician A.
Politician B is not directly bought by a lobbyist, but wants the assistance of Politician A to get a bill introduced and/or passed.
Politician A influences Politician B through intimidation or favor to do what the Lobbyist influenced Politician A to do.
If you taint one politician with lobbying, you taint them all.

He won't need to in time. That's the beauty of things like Bitcoin. They open up the financial markets to everyone, everywhere.
The first step was the internet. The second is an internationally accepted financial medium that does not discriminate based on borders or financial status. (i.e. Bitcoin)
The third step? I don't even pretend to know what's next. I'm no genius.
@_date: 2015-07-15 06:14:59
Honestly, they don't accept Bitcoin?
You know what that means? The $6 I was actually going to pay to watch it stays in my wallet and I download it on PirateBay for free.
Next time, accept Bitcoin...you hypocrites.

"people would simply move to another blockchain. "
God I hate when people say this. It has taken 6 YEARS to get .0001% of the world's population to use Bitcoin even once. Sure, we'll just "hop on" another currency overnight.

You are exactly right.
But WHO do you think is responsible for the government stepping in and orchestrating the monopolistic behavior that reduces/eliminates competition? You think they are doing this on their own?
One word: Lobbyists
Lobbyists hired SPECIFICALLY by the medical industry to create a legislative environment where their good/services will yield a premium.
Surely you see this..

B-Bu-But the government wouldn't lie. If they say he is a criminal...he is a criminal!
Drugs kill people, after all.

*Is Backpage's primary use prostitution?*
I suppose that would depend on the individual.
For some, it's a place to look for apartments. For others, it's a place to find a stripper for a bachelor party. Others, escorts. Now whether those escorts are engaging in legal prostitution or not can vary.
I mean, if I want a girl to tie me up and beat me with a whip because I'm into BDSM, who the FUCK is the Sheriff of Cook County to say I can't? Fuck him...and fuck the hypocritical douchebags that try to impose their fucked up version of "morality" on the rest of us.
Hiring a dominatrix for non-sexual contact is LEGAL in the United States. Contrary to popular belief, not everyone on Backpage is a trafficked sex slave from Russia.
