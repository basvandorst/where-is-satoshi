20k wafers is an estimate, we wont get the actual number from TSMC. Bitmain is also still making L3+ and the new A3, plus they have an AI chip that for all we know could account for a significant number of wafers if big biz or China gov are buying those chips.

Ive tested using Electrum 3.0 for a 2 of 2 with 1 Ledger and 1 standard wallet on an offline Linux system. You probably wont find any step by step instructions for doing it with 1 or 2 Ledgers but the overall multisig process is detailed on Electrum's site. Keep researching and test it out for yourself with small amounts before moving your whole stash.

Antminers are louder than an old vacuum cleaner from the 80's, whats the point of seeking a quiet PSU? 
 
Anyway if thats what you want there are not that many options, you would need to buy a 1500 or 1600 watt PSU from a reputable manufacturer such as Corsair, EVGA, Seasonic, etc. Also make sure you connect it to a 220v outlet or a 15A 120v outlet.  
If you want something cheaper look on Aliexpress, Bits Be Trippin on YouTube recommends one from there it does 1600w and has 2 AC inputs so you can run it on 2 10A 120v plugs.

GG Op on an authentic quality post that will inevitably be buried by memes and reposts.

You can put the 24 words into Electrum 3 directly but you need to select BIP39 in the options menu on the words page. On the next page for Derivation use m/49'/0'/0' if you were using SegWit on the Ledger or m/44'/0'/0' if non-SegWit. Confirmed working I was testing recovery earlier today.

When I sell something on CL I  put "Bitcoin accepted" in my post and guess how many people have paid me with Bitcoin? Zero
@_date: 2018-06-15 07:35:35
It would be an "apples to oranges" comparison, Bitcoin miners can't compute anything else and standard supercomputers are not made for, or efficient at, mining. 
It has been said (years ago) that the top 500 supercomputers in the world combined could not mine anywhere near the hashrate of the Bitcoin network, although I have never seen any detailed analysis on the subject.

In stock is nice but these are 50% slower than the Antminer S9 despite using roughly the same amount of power and costing the same.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:38:39
Time to find a block in seconds = difficulty x 2^32 / hashrate. So one specific hash has a 1 in difficulty x 2^32 chance of finding the solution for a new block.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:00:38
Literally the first result on Google explains it in detail  - my TLDR version: Bitcoin code wants each new block to be found every 10 minites on average, the difficulty number is adjusted every 2 weeks to maintain that 10 minute block time as more or less hash power is being used to find blocks.

Anyone who actually used an Antminer knows that the control board is a just a simple linux system that runs cgminer and communicates with the ASICs. Dragonmint using the same board as Innosilicon (pictured on the right) or Bitmain has nothing to do with the quality of their miner or competence of their engineering team.

Replying to this post and your reply to my post below: a less esoteric view would be to say that the Bitcoin network exhibits emergent behavior, Andreas Antonopoulis has compared it to a colony of 10,000 ants that are able to build large structures and even "farm" their food. Each ant has no practical intelligence and is only following simple rules but as a group they can accomplish great feats. Bitcoin can be seen the same way (simple code produces a complex syatem) but it still requires human observation and understanding to find meaning and usefulness in the data stored in the blockchain.
Calling Bitcoin sentient is a sort of anthropormorphization, you are only implanting your sentience onto it. However if millions of people do this, now Bitcoin has become sentient in the collective consciousness of anyone participating. I think this is one of the main reasons Bitcoin will not be supplanted, it has always had the most "mind share" of any crypto and new coins are inevitably compared to Bitcoin which infers that it is the progenitor by which all others were born.
In terms of actually competing with other coins on a technical level I think layer 2 solutions on Bitcoin will be more versatile and scale better than any new "layer 1" coin can do on its own. Ethereum may be a better network for certain things such as tokens, contracts, etc but due to the centralized development and difficulty in properly coding secure contracts it is not all well suited as Bitcoin for simple storage of large amounts of wealth.

200,000 from the Bulgarian mafia and 100,000 from this guy...seems like these criminals don't understand real opsec and treat their private keys like a suitcase full of cash.

The same Maersk that had to shut down their ports for days 2 months ago when they were hit by Petya ransomware? The same Microsoft that made the operating system vulnerable to Petya? Sounds like a great idea

1) only invest what you can afford to lose, nothing is guaranteed
2) diversify, don't put ALL your extra money in Bitcoin
3) never sell (HODL) unless you seriously need the cash or feel satisfied with your gains
4) don't buy mining hardware or cloud mining contracts.
Source: miner since 2013, spent too much on mining hardware instead of buying BTC, sold early, etc
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:36:59
Just be glad you had the BTC, you might have gotten sued for wrecking that persons car and not being able to pay. I cashed out some BTC back in the day to pay old tickets and court fees...needless to say holding them until today would have covered any late fees and still left $ thousands in my pocket.

This is FUD i opted to take my 55% payout on 9/2 and recieved it in less than 48 hours. I haven't logged in again (no reason to) but i've heard accounts are being disabled after refunds are issued.
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:59:34
The simple math is that $xx dollars of BTC purchased in 2011-2016 are now worth $1 million.
For example I got in to bitcoin around $3 (yeah im bitter about it too). Could have spent $750 then for 250 BTC and it would be worth a milly now. In the theoritcal if Bitcoin goes up 10x over the next few years, you would need to spend $100k now to get a mil worth then. Possible? Yes. Likely? Maybe. Do I have $100k to invest today? No, but some people do and the more people buy because they think its going up 10x, the more the price actually goes up.

AMD and nVidia don't make mining cards, they make GPUs. The board partners (Asus, Sapphire, etc) make the mining cards. AMD and nVidia only care about how many GPUs they can sell, doesn't matter to them what it gets used for after the sale.
With that said, they still refuse to ramp up production beyond normal levels to end the shortage because if the mining demand dies down the market will be flooded with used cards and the supply chain will be stuck with excess inventory of new cards that wont sell.

What is the problem exactly? I already got my 55% refund, requested on 9/2 and received in under 48 hours.

"Expect nothing and be pleasantly surprised if it delivers" yeah this is my attitude towards reddit...
On topic the OP must be regretting not buying sooner or doesn't realize that Bitcoin has actually created many milionaires already, most of them are smart enough not to post about their riches but they are out there. The dynamics have changed and the stakes are much higher now but it has always been a gamble to put money into BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:13:30
Yes I honestly do think it will reach $1 milion. Maybe not in my lifetime, maybe only in 2140 when the block reward is over and the network runs only on fees. In my hypothetical opinion future only the mega rich own Bitcoin. The same people who curently pay $100-150 million for rare art that looks like trash to the average person. Or possibly even governments of third and first world countries will hoard it. 3rd world will hold it as a hedge against their own weak currencies. 1st world will hold it to keep it out of the hands of the citizens to force them to keep using the debt based fiat. I could go on but I think the question is when, not if.

Good point, maybe not but there is no doubt in my mind the Thailand authorities will use the 'ole $5 wrench method to try to obtain the keys.

Given this we might be tempted to say a transaction is “confirmed” once it has been included in a block which is not the very last block in the blockchain. However, it is possible (although rare) for the last n blocks to be orphaned in a reorganization. This is exponentially less likely to occur the larger n gets. It typically happens multiple times a day, for example, that a single block is orphaned, but has happened only a few dozen times in history for n between 2 and 4, and exactly once for ngreater than 4 (a 24-block reorganization in March 2013 due to a technical glitch).

For me the lightbulb went off when I fully researched and understood the technical details of Bitcoin (the protocol, the blockchain, the token, etc).  If you are not a technical person you may never really "get it" TBH. Sounds like you're trying though, I recommend reading the origial whitepaper by Satoshi, running a full node, creating a paper wallet, etc. Just hearing people talk about the moon and the memes are not going to help you understand the what and why of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:54:33
Just guessing but most likely a)round number is easier to use for estimation purposes and/or b)the last million BTC will take over 100 years to mine but the first 20 mil will be created in most of our lifetimes.

Second image in the article says 2600kh/s at 4 watts or 650kh/s per watt. Antminer S9 is 5,000,000 times faster and 1500x more efficient. Edit for the math
