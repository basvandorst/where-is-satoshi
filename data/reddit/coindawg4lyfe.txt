Your mastering the art

This means that owners of hundreds if not thousands of bars of gold would rather have this new technology..And begins the New Economy.

Also Canada has already approved mutual fund.. 100k still possible end of year.

You'd prefer one or 2 companies to monopolize then. It's science all manufacturers centralize to make cheapest miner Asics and then one group control the entire network. Ie bitmain. When the price of BTC goes down it's usually jihan Wu dumbing BTC to pay the electric bill

IF we can make BTC an algo like PHI2, X16 or Lyra2z that would be wonderful for the network but would also redistribute the wealth of nations to people who need it most.. Not Bitmain.. they are getting 18 Billion for IPO...OK youve had your fun now let other people make a few satoshi. 1 GPU 1 VOTE

BTC needs to find his daddy !! he will one day and then the world will finally see BTC grow up to be a handsome young man.

No utility..BTC is money.. you just said money has no utility..you just said digital cash has no utility..derp de derp !!

Sends BTC to 3rd party..losses it. Im really upset for the entire community seriously this is why DEXs are so important. If someone robs a bank do you go dump your fiat currency..no. BTC is money just like anything else. Bithumb is cool for covering that loss also.

Wait till another major gov Fiat currency collapses like Venezuela. People will come to BTC similarly to gold silver in times of economic trouble. But right now everyone likes there little tethers 
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:32:27
Buy ETH...
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:13:09
Flappycoin or GTFO
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:27:32
Sadly they didn't mention the most important part ! BTCP has privacy,  zk-snarks !!

CBOE has the wealth of small nation's. They get what they want

6 months ago it was 19k. Great post. Much content 
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:25:12
They would have destroyed it long long ago my friend. It's here to stay and will not be easily taken down

Namely the US government is a greedy war machine. And will put you in prison for not funding that machine.

^this guy bought at 20k and sold at 6k. Now is too broke to buy back in when ETF gets approved..love it ��
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:01:40
Which sounds better ?, holding approx 8k of fiat currency for a year or holding 1 BTC for a year ! I know what i would do lol 
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:14:42
Coinbase needs to die.
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:27:20
I don't suggest coinbase unless you want IRS on your ass for the rest of your life. Remember Governments hate BTC because they cannot print it to fund war like they do with Fiat.
@_date: 2018-07-15 18:50:44
Hopefully 25k
