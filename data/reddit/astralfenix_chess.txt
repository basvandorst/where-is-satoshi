Well it's pretty obvious that if you have a gun and use it to resist a robbery or whatever, then there's a higher chance of you being shot. That's the inherent risk of standing up to villains. Why is this a bad thing?

I think you wrote 'owner' wrong. You would have to be a total idiot to be the owner of an exchange and let anyone other than yourself have access to the main stash and/or fail to airgap it. Ofc employees would need access to some funds for day to day stuff, but not the main stash

This is spot on and should be more upvoted. But it's not bullish enough to be popular

Meh. Each halvening is half as important to price as the one before it (assuming equal trading volume to 4 years ago, with higher volume it's even LESS important), so I'm not expecting miracles this time round.

Well g'day mate! Let's put another shrimp on the barbie!

Nonsense. Firstly, as others have noted, bitcoin is a store of value, and thus is used every day.  Secondly, when the internet was 6 years old it was very sparse. Little content, no search engines.  In fact according to [this]( there were only around 100 internet hosts globally at the time. So yes, a small group of tech nerds were using it every day, but nobody else had any reason to. However, many of those who saw no value in using it AT THE TIME still knew that it would be huge in the future. Which is exactly the case with bitcoin today.

It's almost as if different people on the sub have different views. And it's \*almost\* as if people say "bankers don't know shit" when they say certain things, but not when they say other things.

If enough people believe in a technical signal, then it's a self fulfilling prophecy. It's that simple

He's not being pedantic. You said it was gambler's fallacy. It wasn't. Words have meanings.

In other words the guy with the counterfeit money printing machine is telling you that he's really printing the money for *everyone else's* benefit, not his own. But hey, it must be true because there's an unproven scientific-sounding theory backing it up, right?

I really don't understand this view, although I see it a lot. Why would the market care about direct fiat &lt;&gt; altcoin options? If the market rates a given alt at a given market cap, it's because that's the perceived value of that alt. It has nothing to do with whether you have to go through bitcoin to get it. Unless you think there's a convenience factor, where people just can't be bothered with the extra step? Even then, that would only apply to smalltime investors - anyone with serious money to invest (aka the price setters) wouldn't be put off by this.
