Probably not given satoshi was wrong about scaling and how we need to rewrite the whitepaper?
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:57:34
Can you elaborate? Monopoly of miners? Users?

Essentially appealing to govt for special privileges, tarrifs, quotas, protection from competition etc will lead to undermining the free market and the business of the appellant himself/herself. 
Matt Corallos submission is very dangerous and would undermine bitcoin and cryptos in general. It is fundamentally an argument against freedom itself because he doesnt like the competition and is seeking to use force, or get someone else to use force on his behalf to stop the "unfair" competition. 
This is the most basic mindset of a socialist. Which is why imo only libertarians, whatever vein they are minarchists, anarchists etc are the only ones who actually "get" bitcoin.

Reading this I'm reminded of the suicidal tendencies of business folk explained by Milton Friedman.

Competition is not "fair". And I don't want Mr Corallo or the SEC to decide for me what is "fair". 
Why not let the free market decide what the users want. If we don't like seg2x then we won't use it. If we do like it then we'll use it. Users have the ultimate say in this. 
Trying to get the force of the state to intervene in the development and progression of bitcoin goes against everything bitcoin stands for and why it was  created by satoshi in the first place.

In a free market there is competition. If you don't like your opponent or think they are not playing fair set your resources against them. Propagandise, come up with a better alternative to appeal to consumers, whatever you think works best. 
If you don't like seg2x come up with a better alternative and convince users to join you. Anyone is free to make their own hard fork. That's the beauty of bitcoin no one owns it and whatever fork appeals to us users the most will win . 
When you start talking about govt intervention that is  moving away from free and voluntary cooperation and using the threat of or actual use of force. I really hope that's not what we as a community and collectively as users want to see happen. 
And who decides what is "fair"? I'll make my own decision as should everyone else.

Value is also a function of utility
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:47:39
The branding and network are two separate things. IF, and that's a bit IF, they do get a majority say on the name, who cares because it might still end up being the minority fork if the majority of miners and users reject it and prefer the alternative fork. 
I think it's dubious to conclude that a BIT will have a majority say on ebay gets to carry the bitcoin name. My guess is they will prefer to follow the miners and users who will be signaling prefork and but most importantly confirm post fork by actually mining and transacting on the fork they prefer. 
Holders don't transact so they don't have a voice only those with skin in the game being miners and users. Money talks and bullshit walks as they say! 
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:09:17
I take your point but I think you are overstating the case of a SEC approved bitcoin investment trust. 
Miners and users have the ultimate say. Miners have a vote according to hash power and users according to what chain offers the most utility and the one they want to use. 
My guess is a BIT may own a lot of bitcoins but they won't do a lot of transactions. They will just hold them. That doesn't give them any power or votes at all only at the point you transact you have to put your money where your mouth is and decide what is best. 
If bitcoin is going to become something that is used by millions everyday that sheer force of velocity will have the biggest vote of all even more than the miners a BIT or the people that simply hold. 
In that case BIT would have to think very carefully about which chain it decides to follow. It will have a large vote for sure but after that what if it makes the wrong choice and users collectively choose another chain that they consider offers more utility. The BIT will be in very serious trouble. I don't they would want to take that risk and let the market decide and follow that.

Thank you I do too. Things have moved on a lot since early days and it's to be expected given how much money is at stake now. 
Bad people are going to replace good people with positions of power in bitcoin like development. Mostly because they tend to be more efficient at getting control and power. To protect and preserve the future of bitcoin I believe hard forks are good and necessary to allow us the users to have a choice of competing alternatives. When that is gone then the alternatives will be alt coins.

Monopoly status over what?

Will be good to add liquidity to the market
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:35:17
I wonder who will maintain such a blockchain? Or any others like it? 
Alumni will set up nodes and miners to do this? What's the incentive? 
Maybe one day there will be specialised data centres that specialise in maintaining blockchains but doesn't seem to be very decentralised and how will they be reimbursed for doing it?

Thats a great idea thanks. I like the idea of a goodbye letter too that will be a hard one to write though
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:23:35
I wondered this myself and whether it was right thing to do. I don't like the idea of keeping secrets. 
But I'm a solo dad and don't trust people very much. He has extended family in case I do die tomorrow that would care for him. But at least he knows about it. If he didn't then might just end up in the rubbish.

You require first statement throws out there the question of what do "we" do about satoshis coins. But cover yourself by saying it's a separate issue and deal with that matter later. The real issue is whether we should "trust" satoshi. Ok say "we" conclude satoshi cannot be trusted. Now let's deal with the coins he owns. It's a sly way of going about trying to justify theft. I'm not saying this is your intention or objective. But that is the line of reasoning that would be used to justify theft or confiscation of his coins. 
I doubt you have actually read the white paper or maybe you have but clearly didn't understand it. Bitcoin is trustless. The whole point of it is you don't have to trust anyone except the cryptography and maths. Whether you trust satoshi or not is irrelevant. All our coins are secured by private keys. 
And what do you mean by "trust" anyway? Trust him to do what? Do you think we need a set of rules or guidelines on what we should and shouldn't do with our bitcoins?

Adoption is only going to grow therefore is still very early days imo. People have had the same opinion when it hit 10, 100, 1000, and soon 10,000. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:42:08
I disagree it's not another issue at all. It's a non issue that should never be open for debate. Ownership of private keys is the foundation of bitcoin without it there would be no bitcoin. To take away ownership of someone's private key is no different than theft and it should never be open to question. 
Inflation (and deflation) is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. In addition to the white paper i recommend you read up on the quantity theory of money. It will greatly benefit a deeper understanding and appreciation of bitcoin.

Your whole post is full of errors. 
First of all "deserve" has no place in bitcoin. Satoshi mined them then they are his. End of story. 
The coins are not "lost" or "spent". They are unspent transactions. It's up to the owner of the unspent transactions whether they want to spend them or not. If they remain unspent for eternity then so be it. 
To the extent they remain unspent and out of circulation they are deflationary not inflationary.
Edit. I think my post comes off as quite salty so sorry but it's because I find it very troubling when people start questioning satoshis or anyone else's for that matter right to the coins they mined or purchased. If we are even going to remotely entertain such debates then the only conclusion is that "something has to be done with those coins...". And who is going to decide? If that happens then bitcoin is a failure and could no longer be trustless. 
I recommend you invest some time into reading the white paper.

This is BS. Friedman would never have supported QE during the GFC never mind the fact he wasn't even alive. Anna Swartz who co-wrote a monetary history of the United States with him publicly denounced the QE describing it as a problem of insolvency not liquidity and the banks should be allowed to go broke. 
The fed themselves accept they caused the great depression and Bernanke accepted that and publically apologised to Friedman and Swartz for causing it. 
Friedman throughout his life said the fed was a failure and should be abolished. He believed the fed should be replaced by math based rules that allowed the money supply to grow by around 2% pa in line with gdp output so prices would remain stable i.e not inflationary or deflationary. He would have welcomed bitcoin despite its deflationary monetary policy as I have come around to this myself. Deflation is not always bad and promotes more careful spending and allocation of resources. 
The accusations that he was a statist for proposing school vouchers and a negative income tax he addressed to a group of Austrian libertarians in the video below from about the 20 minute mark

You assume "society" is synonymous with "government".
