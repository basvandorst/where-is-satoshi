That tip notification only occurs after someone has set up their ChangeTip account and connected it to their Twitter account. Bitcoin can only be added to their ChangeTip bitcoin wallet after they have created one, otherwise it is a tip waiting to be claimed.

Tips are accepted automatically if you have your ChangeTip account connected to your Twitter account. Tips are only returned if you don't have a ChangeTip account and choose not to claim the tip within 2 weeks. The more you know!
