But that would require me to google what Timezone ET is. Turns out to be UTC-5. And then I still have to add up or subtract the hours. Giving a UTC +/- time instead of the name of the timezone skips that step. And as far as I know only people who either live in a timezone or near it know the timezone names.
"Let's meet at 3am EAT!", "*The game starts at 1pm IST*. That late? In India we have dinner at 1pm IST! *India? IST is Irish Standard Time!* Oh really? It's also India Standard Time!", "Meet me at 4am CST", "Be online at 12:30 SCT". 
All pretty confusing, not? Much easier for international people:
"Let's meet at 3am UTC+3!", "The game starts at 1pm UTC+1. Ok", "Meet me at 4am UTC-6", "Be online at 12:30 UTC+4".

The US centrism is sometimes annoying. Hate it when Americans give US timezones for international events. Like "The e-Sport broadcast starts on twitch  CST". Thanks! I don't have a clue what time your event starts.

I tell it will start  UTC+3. Usually people know in which timezone they live and can subtract or add the hours.

Anyone please criticize this comment! Financial institutions might fear blockchain as it offers an alternative for services that have been provide by banks for centuries and longer. Blockchain does it more reliable and for a fraction of the cost. 
I dont think the financial industry is really threatened by it, but some services will just disappear with nothing for them in return.
My personal belief is dat there will be a cryptocurrency one day that is very dominant and maybe even more important than the dollar and/or gold. Because either of those bubbles popped or because that coin (prob not bitcoin) has proven to be much better in every aspect and has grown astronomically.

Yeah a +/- UTC time. I understand people just do it out of habit and it's easy to Google, but if you want the world to watch then provide proper service. "Come and watch the game, we start at 3pm AMT!"

For BTC it is clear who owns it and how much there is of it. This in Stark contrast to many financial products that get fractured, resold untill it's unclear who owns it and multiple institution claim it as their asset. Listen to crypto voices. They have many interesting and insightful shows on economy, finance and Bitcoin. I think show 24 with Brian Kelly is one where this subject is discussed.
