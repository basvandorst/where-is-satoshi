it looks like over $600 will be the responsibility of the business to report as well.  I am thinking at this level it will become a huge hassel to accept bitcoin.

I would seek other methods, lenders club is pretty good for loans depending on your credit score.  
I would exhaust all other methods before taking a loan out of any institution.  Debt is modern day slavery

I am not entirely sure either,  but that is something to look into obviously.  It would be tempting though if approved for btc even if you have to pay back in btc, and to that I would say do not do it.  I don't see how else they could guarantee 20 percent returns to investors  borrowers only pay 6 percent.

I am wondering how businesses accepting Bitcoin will be affected, how will they have to report these sales?  Will it be up to the business to charge the tax or will it be solely on the customer of the business.

Well the UK being part of the EUROPEAN UNION one could reasonabally assume that the ECB also sets their Interest rates.....  But I am sure you know everything about everything and have a lot of friends based on this comment.  Your one of those redditors who just goes around adding no value to anything right?  You didn't say who sets the UK's rates in your response, you just posed another question in a demeaning way.  I can tell your life must be awesome.

Why did J.P. Morgan upgrade Twitter?  Why are they allowed to hold shares of twitter and make a determination as to what its rating is?  Their ratings influence the market, so it seems like this should be illegal yet it isn't.  Why not?

I have been using coinbase instant buys for over a year and have never had an issue.  This has been happening to me over the past several weeks.  They e-mail me saying the problem is fixed, then I go to buy BTC and it gets cancelled.  I dont want to wait 5 days for my bitcoin with the value being so volatile.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:29:23
I know you are right, but there are people out there who will be scared away by scenarios like this... it was complicated enough for people before this classification.  I don't understand this classification when it is clearly not property.  People engage in direct commerce with bitcoin which they do not with property.  I don't go and buy items with my Stocks that I own.  This is BS by the gov't intended to kill the bitcoin in my opinion,

If the ECB were to raise interest rates, do you think this would cause a collapse in the UK like we had in 2008 in the United States?  It looks like the UK housing market is in a massive bubble with a lot of foreign investment coming in and government assisted down payment programs causing prices to sky rocket over the last few years, but if the interest rate crept up these loans would cost more and more, which I believe would lead to a panic as payments start to rise if these people are on ARM or balloon payment loans, and they will also be unable to refinance due to larger payment pushing their DTI ratio above the allowable threshold.  Would this ECB interest rate rise cause something like this to happen?

This is a new problem they have been having.  I am not sure what caused it, but I am experiencing the same thing after using this site for over a year now.

Well i imagine a spam bot's trophy case would mirror yours, if you look at mine it would be hard to assume that.  It was a legitimate question as I signed up yesterday, and I want to know if they are owned by etsy.  I also wanted to show people my store, is this inconveniencing you in any way?

garage sale, family loan, there aren't alot to be honest, but if you are absolutely going to get a loan, get the loan in USD or the currency your trying to do business in if your not in a country that uses the USD for business.  By all means accept BTC once you are up and running, but you don't want to take a loan in BTC.  I looked at the site a little, but I didn't get into the details of BTCjam.  Do you take the loan in BTC?  If you take the loan in BTC, do you repay it in BTC?  If you do, then this is not the greatest situation to be in given the volatility, not to mention the fact that the more BTC loans this company gives the worse it would be for the borrowers because the value of BTC would go up.  There are business loans out there, you have to create a pretty solid business plan though and know your numbers.  My brother in law works at BofA as a small business banker with revenues ranging from 2-5million.  I run a small business that is bootstrap funded, but my business required probably 5 % of the start up cost that you need.  It can be done though, don't lose faith.  Check out grants and small business associations where you are too, they should be able to help find better resources for your area.

I know Bitcoin itself will survive, are there any reputable companies that sell Bitcoin mining machines?

Looking at seals with clubs the poker site, if I deposit on the site and make money, withdraw it and exchange it to dollars.  at what rate am I supposed to be taxed at.... I could deposit with BTC at $600 and withdraw with BTC at $500 where maybe I would have made BTC but lost dollars.  With the fluctuation, its going to cause alot of confusion, and the IRS will have to write a huge tax code on it that will be ignored by BTC users, they are going to have to create a crypto arm of the IRS just to keep track of all the crap that will result in this.

It would and will kill the market when it does happen.  No one will receive their BTC and keep it as BTC.  There may be a percentage that keep it as BTC because they believe in BTC, but the majority will feel burned and want to convert it to something else ASAP.  Mt. Gox has killed BTC several times like this yet it always rebounds.  I don't think BTC will recover from something of this magnitude.  I think it is better for Mt. Gox to simply dump them back all at once, this will cause the price to drop but also stabilize.  You may see the price drop to around $50-$100 a BTC, hopefully another crypto would emerge that is more secure and take the place of BTC as the leader of the market.  Do we really want BTC to maintain its value if it has all these issues?  Looking at the options out there, is BTC the best choice to be the leading currency?  Because you will lose a great deal of personal wealth you may say Yes, but it is widely known that there are faster and more secure options that accomplish the same objective as BTC, but we are tied to BTC because if BTC went down to nothing, we would go down to nothing. We engage in these arguments trying to prop up something that should die, when it dies a more capable replacement will emerge, but this has no chance of happening with BTC valued 10x is closest competitor.  You only like BTC because of its value not because the possibility of it replacing a currency or becoming an accepted currency because Mt. Gox has by itself caused the price to drop 3 times within the past year.  If something has that kind of influence on a market, then it should not be a market, that is just the concentration of power that BTC was seeking to avoid.

The Quark Coin is a scam coin how?  I also accept bitcoin and Lite coin, and you left a site because it played music, there is a prominent off button so you dont have to listen to it.... some people visit the site just to see what song is playing.  I got my first crypto order from Quark, so they have been nothing but good to me so far.

i am not spamming it, i am getting opinions on how to improve my website.  I already paid for advertising on Reddit, so I dont spam it.....

not spam, i am taking a risk by accepting bitcoin, but I believe in the eventual rebound.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:52:46
but vendors cant accept it as payment, that is what will kill it.  NOw it will be hard for Americans to get BTC on the exchanges.  Euro zone is working on controls.  I think it will go down farther till it rebounds.

I went through the whole verification process, it took over 30 days to complete everything, but I can now buy 10 BTC a day.  It is safe and easy to get started, I have never had any issues.  You can buy .1 instantly until you complete the whole process.
