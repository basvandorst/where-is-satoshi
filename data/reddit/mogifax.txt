Hi, a random question I couldn't find an answer to in the googles.  I sent a couple of mbtc to my father overseas into his BTC address he opened on the iPad and iPad only (didn't go through the Blockchain.info website).  He forgot the password and clicked the "forget wallet" button.  Naturally, he got issued a new wallet with a zero balance.  His old address still has his funds, but I have no idea how to get into it.  Ideas?  Thank you.

He was on Joe Rogen podcast recently. He said the same stuff he did in 2008.  His only point is that bitcoin can very easily be a precursor to something better similar to MySpace, Yahoo, Blockbuster, etc. 
And he's right. There's nothing special about the bitcoin protocol itself that can't be replicated and improved as evidenced by a million of altcoins.  Therefore, the only barrier is acceptance. As the example of the Ice Bucket Challenge, every internet meme, and the Kardashians have taught us, anything can catch on at any time.
Personally I think the bitcoin blockchain will be replaced by something better like any other software product. People hodling bitcoin for the most part are disingenuous in claiming that they will hodl it until it becomes money. No way that's true as everyone has a number.
I, for one, think we do have a Friendster / MySpace / Facebook situation going on.

This is a massive circlejerk and you people know it.  While the price is high, everyone is stroking each other's throbbing shafts about decimal points because everyone suddenly has $1,000-50,000 worth of magic internet money. Nerds.
The answer is twofold: 1. No one gives a fuck 2. When it's time, it will be figured out.
No one is going to millibits or picobits or whatever the shit you people came up with if the price in dollars comes crashing down.  And even if it goes to $1M per BTC (*cue the sound of ten thousand faps*), a single bitcoin will mean as much to an average person as a vault bar of gold.

Had some American contacts buy handmade modern art from Kiev, Ukraine.  To say it was a nightmare to arrange the payment would be an understatement.
Some of the obstacles we experienced were origin fees, destination fees, clearing bank fees, conversion fees, new account opening fees.  The slap in the face was this -- the bank opened a brand new euro account on the receiver side in Kiev because they decided to only process payments in euros.  The receiver already had a dollar account.  But because the receiver "wished to receive the funds in dollars", they -- I shit you not -- received dollars into the newly-opened euro account, converted dollars into euros, AND THEN CONVERTED EUROS INTO DOLLARS AGAIN "in accordance with wishes of the receiving party" and deposited the final amount into the dollar account.
All he did was say "well, they are Americans, they will be sending dollars, so I guess I will be receiving dollars".
The assholes used the euro as some sort of a forex tumbler to screw everyone on 1) account opening fees 2) currency exchange fees 3) currency fluctuations beneficial to them.
I could not believe this.  Bitcoin can't catch on fast enough.

Each bitcoin or a pair of special twin pixies that live in a digital world full of secrets and puzzles.
One twin is very extroverted and loves attention.  Her name is Public Key.  The other twin is extremely secretive.  So secretive she is, in fact, that she looks and acts nothing like like her sister.  Her name is Private Key.
The twins were separated at birth like Lindsay Lohan's character in the *Parent Trap*.  If anyone other than their parents knew they were related, bad things could happen to them.
Once in a while, they meet.  When they meet, they can make important decisions like where to go and what to buy.  Because they could be seen together, they are most vulnerable and need to be protected.  You can draw then together on paper, on the computer, on USB flash drives, or even tattoo their likenesses on your body.  Those are just pictures of the twins, not the twins themselves.  They don't live in our world, you see, they live in the special world of secrets and puzzles.
Only special people from our world can enter theirs.  These people are called "miners".  They scour the puzzle world far and wide, back and forth, thousands of billions times, just to track down where every pair of twins has been, and claim their reward.  These dedicated miners spent thousands of dollars on very special picks and axes, and they will never see that money again.

I was just going to say ... That list is not that impressive once you spend 30 seconds putting it into perspective.  Top 25 people have any kind of decent "wealth" (above $10M), if you can call it that -- because convertability into spendable currency still sucks.  The rest are holding BTC worth under ten million dollars.  I know 10 mil sounds like a lot of money, but Sarah Silverman got like 3 mil as a book advance from her publisher ... Shit, Seinfeld made more off his TV show than the market cap of this entire payment network.  And there are tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people who easily make above 10 mil this very minute.
If anything, this list is a proof, not a refutation, that BTC is still at the beginning of its road.  And yes, if it catches on, 10,000,000 satoshis 10 years from now could be a lot of money.

I would really make sure you've researched accepting alternative forms of payment.  Whenever for-profit business interests meet the government, things tend to get dicey.
I'm from Eastern Europe.  I've witnessed several people and businesses get in deep shit in the government by treating the foreign currency like the local sovereign currency.  For example, a small shop owner was caught accepting US dollars in exchange for goods instead of the local *gryvnas*.
Remember that we have the Article 8 of the US Constitution that basically says that only Congress can issue, regulate, and determine the value of the currency of the land.
You may make the argument that "hey, BTC might as well be magical internet tokens or made-up vitual sprites" or whatever.  What harm can you cause by accepting dollars, loonies, live chickens, or BTC as payment, right?  Well, imagine you have to pay capital gains on a wildly appreciated bitcoin sale retroactively ... or pay some weird sales tax that your State issues ... or report every BTC transaction with your local franchising office.  Things like that are not mere regulations -- as of today, they live in weird gray legal no-mans-land.

There are similarities, but they are not as broad as everyone is circlejerking about.  
The Internet was starting to develop as a form of communication.  It's like an upgraded version of yelling over the fence to your neighbor, except the neighbor was anyone with a computer, and yelling was typing.
Bitcoin is stepping on a lot more toes and can potentially threaten a lot of incredibly deeply-rooted, powerful, interconnected, dynastic interests.  It can be viewed as a challenge to entire governments' legal frameworks and foundational principles.  If we know anything about governments, we can safely assume that when threatened, they don't take it lying down.
But there's a little bit of hope, too.  I'm from Eastern Europe.  Since the 90s, it's been routine to exchange gryvnas for dollars.  Even though it's illegal to conduct any kind of business in foreign currencies, people just swap back and forth as needed because local currencies are much more volatile, and they are pegged to the dollar anyway.  If you get paid in gryvnias and you're saving for a new refrigerator, you'd be converting a portion of your paychecks into dollars every month until you have enough.  Then you just go and exchange dollars for the correct amount of gryvnias right at the store in a little kiosk, and buy your fridge.  You don't care if the fridge costs 10UAH or 100,000,000,000UAH because you're holding dollars.
Something similar could happen to bitcoin here in the States and worldwide.  The government just doesn't have a legal foot to stand on to outright ban digital internet tokens, so they'll likely leave it alone.  Massive adoption via a killer app could reach critical mass with the people, and the rest can follow in the Internet's footsteps.
The only thing I can't quite work out is what happens when you want to buy a candybar for 0.000273BTC.  [Eighty percent of Americans believe in angels]( we can't just expect they are going to understand how decimal points in tiny fractions work.

A waste of electricity.  You're 18-24 months too late.  There are now these things called "Application-Specific Integrated Circuits" (ASICs), which are computer chips designed specifically to do one thing, and one thing only (hash).  Competing with them is like strapping on a pair of cardboard wings and jumping off a roof hoping to compete with a space rocket for orbital supremacy.
I've recently seen an all-ASIC 500 G/hash rig that a guy bought for $10k.  It's reliably cranking out 460 G/hashes a day @ around 0.4 BTC/day.  It will never be profitable.  The guy should have just bought BTC with the money.
If you want to use your old machine to learn BFG miner command line, that's one thing.  But it will take you 10 minutes and doesn't justify running it.  You are probably still thinking, "*yeah, but it's just sitting there, not doing anything.  Might as well be mining.  I don't care how much it mines because anything is better than zero*."  Well, according to any mining yield calculator at 50 megahashes, you'll make 0.00004688 BTC per day ($0.03) at cost of $0.36 per day.
You might still be thinking, "*yeah, but electric bill I pay anyway, who cares if it's just a little extra for another computer, at least I'll have bitcoin*."  In that case, just go buy bitcoin with cash and save yourself the trouble.

I'll give you an example.  I work for a Fortune 50 company.  We just wrapped up a capital project with a $1.2M budget that took 18 months.  The project involved adding another layer to an internal hierarchy.
That's it.  No new systems were written, no manufacturing processes were changed, nothing tangible happened.  An additional layer was added between ProductFamily and ProductCategory.
One guy could have surely done it for like under a month, right?  You would be oh so very wrong.
Same thing would happen here.  You budget $0.5M.  You get a couple of business analysts, a dev lead, some infrastructure guys, a PM, and start the envisioning phase.  Your budget is gone before a single requirements doc is written, and you need at least 3 for a solid product -- a Business Requirements Doc, some kind of a system spec, and then a highly detailed tech spec written by actual developers.
You spend 2 months just whiteboarding, another few months writing docs, and then doing reviews and signoffs while the devs are ramping up.  You will have to think of other major project plan bullets, like DDoS protection, retention and backup policies, hardware, system integration testing environments, user acceptance testing environments, backend servers, front-end and reporting servers, metadata, support policies, user registration policies, contingency controls, system security controls, data sharing procedures, HR and staffing.  ETL workflows alone could eat 6 months (Extract/Transform/Load) just to move data from one set of tables to another.  Don't forget -- just like iOS/Apple developers from a few years back, the bitcoin-specific development community is in its infancy, which means that you may have to spend double/triple on poaching competent devs.  I know I guy who went full iOS developer in 2009.  He was in such demand (and still is) that he was able to quintuple his pay as a former Microsoft/C# code monkey.
You may not need $20 mil, but it's laughable to think that you can create a viable online exchange with staying power for anything under a few mil.

Those who did don't represent a group of any statistical significance.  The overwhelming majority became even more broke than when they originally came to mine and prospect.
This analogy is not flimsy.  Fighting an uphill battle against exponential difficulty increases is analogous to going into increasingly harsh and dangerous conditions to mine gold after all the easy surface stuff has been picked.  In both real and virtual mining, those who provide tools and infrastructure benefit greatly, much more so than the miners themselves.

You can digitally sign a message (or a transaction with a tiny amount of bitcoin), and it will be impossible to forge that signature by anyone else.  The public/private key pair is a perfect solution to things like titles and escrows because the proof of ownership is easily demonstrated by the person holding the private key.
In today's world, "owning a house" means entering a relationship with the bank and the title company.  Nothing can happen without at least two parties consenting, but it requires massive amount of paperwork and confusion because nothing talks to anything else and all lookups are more-less manual.  Just look at the robo-singing nightmare during the mortgage crisis of 2007.  
With the bitcoin blockchain, it's trivial to design escrow transactions that are secure while simultaneously being open and verified by the infrastructure.

It's a combination of things.  There are lots of people with Apple iPhone 4, and its performance has been atrocious on iOS7.  For people who have non-Apple email (which is almost everyone), sync calendars with family members, use Google search, want a faster phone, want better bitcoin integration, and don't care that much about on-paper specs, switching to Android has achieved critical mass.
I've been an Apple evangelist since god knows when.  I got all my extended family members on iOS devices.  But I find myself consistently frustrated when performing daily tasks.  Plus it's the little things, too, and they start to add up.  
For example, if I want to QUICKLY take a video and share it, I can't do it from a locked phone.  The process to take and share a vid from a locked iOS7 iPhone 4 looks like this: Home -&gt; Swipe up -&gt; Swipe left -&gt; wait 3 seconds -&gt; Shutter/Shutter -&gt; Home -&gt; Photos -&gt; Recent video -&gt; Send -&gt; Next -&gt; Mail -&gt; Wait 10-30 seconds -&gt; Recipients -&gt; Send.
Moto X can do it in two flicks of the wrist and a couple of taps.
Plus the blockchain.info app on iOS7 is just a mobile website.  Those little things start to add up.
So hooray for OPs switch from iPhone!

I think I got it ... What the critics don't get is that it's critical to understand which side of the decimal point you're on.  With fiat currencies, you're on the left side - with each new money printing event, your static unit of currency loses value.  With btc, you're on the right side - with each new divisibility event, your static unit of btc gains value.

To complement you comment, I am very carefully watching for the public's attention to bitcoin.  I have a pretty large network of friends and even more colleagues, most very tech savvy, and none have mentioned anything related to bitcoin yet.  I mean, not a single comment.  When just a couple of people start asking, I will certainly perk up, listen, and re-evaluate my attitude towards the investment aspect of BTC.
In the media, I will sit up and listen when the talking heads start saying things like "amazing investment opportunity" and "future of money".  Normally, by the time something reaches them, it's already too late.
Finally, my Dad has 3 degrees, and he still can't grasp the concept of bitcoin.  When he becomes an everyday user of bitcoin, I'll be getting out.  We still have a looong way to go :)

We're in a similar position you and I.  I actually remember playing CivCraft from Week 1, and people in it were selling diamonds for bitcoins when they were pennies and you still couldn't sell.  I think that was around the time of the 10,000 BTC pizza.
I made 10,000+ BTC before I ran CCleaner, uninstalled the qt client, and wiped the drive freespace with that nifty little option of using NSA-grade security.
Here's what it taught me.  Trust yourself.  First and foremost, trust your instincts, your intuition, your gut.  Something told us that bitcoin was a good idea, and it was created as currency from day 1.  My gut was telling me, "hey, even though this is play money, it's still money.  Don't throw away money", but I didn't listen.  I knew it was a revolutionary idea back then because my family lives overseas, and the amount of hassle I had to go through to send them a few bucks should have cemented my faith in bitcoin's value.
Literally the same exact thing happened with 3D printing stocks and some waterfront properties I could have gotten my hands on.  Didn't trust myself, didn't have the balls.  But not any more.

Don is correct in pointing our Bitcoin's orwellian undertones, as in, once you know how to tie a person to an address, you can potentially identify all those connected to him (cannot be done with cash or gold).  He's also correct in identifying bitcoin's role as a possible archetype for the next iteration of state-issued currencies, as in, bitcoin is the Altavista before the next Google.
I think he's a little bitter that silver is in the shitter while BTC is posting thousands of percent growth.  He's wrong in calling it a ponzi -- unless he's referring to the ponzi-like, too-good-to-be-true gains that are based on more and more people entering the market until the eventual crash.  He's wrong on the constitutionality.  But he's not wrong on ALL accounts.

It can't possibly follow a similar trajectory because the US Constitution would need to be amended for it to become as ubiquitous as Ford or Coke.  The Article 8 gives the power to regulate money specifically to Congress.
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:59:37
There's a couple of interesting hurdles for BTC -- first of all, it could become a currency that competes with the US dollar, which makes it unconstitutional (Article 1 Section 8, "*The Congress shall have the power to ... coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures*".  I was born in a country that informally used the US dollar as its hard currency, but all routine commercial transactions had to be conducted in the local currency.  People went to great lengths to hang on to their dollars at the expense of constantly trading back and forth.  Every government takes this kind of stuff very seriously.
Second, if [our leaders don't understand how the Internet works]( how do we expect them to have the slightest idea about how BitCoins are used and created?  Can you imagine how one of these politicians in the pocket of major banks, hellbent on outlawing BTC transactions on the US soil, would butcher the elegant concept of bitcoin?  At this time if they need more money, they tell the Treasury to issue more bonds, the Fed buys them, boom, done.  Imagine them trying to understand how BTCs get conjured into existence by a Napster-like network of who?  Minors?  What?  Get off my lawn!
Still ... even at $100 / BTC, I feel we're at the precipice of something truly revolutionary ... Maybe even that [Biblical mark on the hand]( without which no commercial activity could take place.  The QR code is eerily abstract -- anyone can see whatever they want in it.  I am kidding, of course.
As was mentioned before, Bitcoin is a protocol, the first of probably many.  I would not be surprised if the major banks took this idea and perverted it to their advantage while tying the new cryptocurrency to the US dollar.  Perhaps they could use the decentralized processing and confirmation *a la BitCoin* to lower their massive maintenance costs, retire their awful, byzantine, archaic batch processing systems, gain competitive advantage, and focus on their core competency -- the creation and sale of debt.

I watch most of what Peter does.  The lecture he gave at the real estate broker convention at the top of the real estate bubble is pure gold.
However, I've been getting less and less knowledge from him with each passing month.  He's been railing against inflation for as long as I can remember without taking into account how much people the world over depend on the US dollar.  The currency of my home country (Ukraine) is hard pegged to the dollar, and there are dozens of countries that do the same.
Printing a few hundred billion dollars in the grand scheme of things does nothing.  It may inflate asset prices a bit, but it doesn't get spread among just 300 million Americans.  It's fought over by a pool of 7 billion people in one form or another.  This will continue for many, many years.  There is just not a suitable alternative to unseat the US dollar.  And even if there were a country like China ready to offer up a solution, do they have the Sixth Fleet?  The massive military?  The historical stability of the treasury paper?
In the end, Peter is probably right, but we likely won't see his repeated predictions come true in our lifetimes.

Thanks for the response.


Tomato, tomahto.  "Crash" in this case means a rapid revaluation against some other currency.


I am skeptical of these kinds of claims because they don't mean anything by themselves and they can't stand alone.  Gold bugs have been saying literally the same thing -- "*if only 1% of retirements funds bought gold, the price would go to $10k*".


Again, a very prominent precious metals incantation that's repeated frequently.  Yes, if the USD turns into the Zimbabwean dollar, we're going to have much bigger problems than worrying about the accurate value of a bitcoin.  We're taking societies around the world unraveling kind of a scenario.


I agree with this -- basically, price discovery and supply/demand at work.


I am torn on this.  I grew up in a country where changing the local currency to/from dollars is routine, but I am not convinced the powers that be will allow this to happen.  The stakes are too high.  Even at these price levels, a single warren buffet could take over the entire market out of his couch cushion fund ... imagine the collective power of the world's richest plus the government and power structures (militaries).
In the end, I just wanted to know whether there's a technical reason for creating this new plateau.  If the answer is, "no reason, just price discovery", I'm cool with that.

If your "legitimate" feedback is "*how come something that was invented a couple of years ago is not immediately huge*", then it's easily rebutted.  Just look at adoption curves for all new technologies.  Philo Farnsworth invented television in 1927, but it wasn't marketed until the late 40s.  Look how far we've come just within last couple of decades -- first with cable, then with TV programming that rivals large studio productions.
Impatience or jealousy are not legitimate criticisms.  It radio, telegraph, television, Internet allowed people to buy easily share-able pieces of themselves, they would see adoption curves similar to those of bitcoin.
Personally, I think bitcoin's future is not necessarily as currency.  I believe that within 15-20 years we won't even care what bitcoin is the same way we don't care what TCP/IP is.  We will use the small currency packets inside the blockchain to do other useful things.  
When you buy a house, the title company charges you $500 to do what, move some papers around and change a couple of names?  Bitcoin can do it in seconds by having a single satoshi change hands.  When you send money overseas, the banks unceremoniously bend you over with crazy fees and it still takes days for the transaction to post.  Bitcoin can do the same for free in minutes.
Legitimate criticisms of bitcoin include:
- No buyer protection (fixable)
- Deflationary in an inflationary fiat world (feature)
- Can be lost irreversibly (same as cash)
The whole "*I think it's too expensive*" shtick is a) subjective and b) getting old.

The "thousands of years of history" argument fails to admit that during that history we didn't know any better.

Being smart is not just knowing things.  It's relating many things and events together, weighing risks, and taking some of those risks.  Most of the people in this thread own BTC, but fewer people own many of them.

I don't think that will ever happen in the US.  Using BTC for transactions with tax ramifications is unconstitutional.  In the USA, only the US Congress has the power to issue currency and levy tax.

I'm not sure you're familiar with exactly what the elite looks like.  The fact that a few dudes are sitting on piles of magic internet money and likely can't cash it out all at once without raising a million red flags from IRS to the DoHS doesn't threaten bankers and politicians.  It's like saying that a dude with a bunch of Yahoo stock in the 2000s was somehow aiding in a wealth transfer away from the entrenched, dynastically-wealthy Beltway and Wall Street types.  You have to be either high or naive to believe that, probably both.


That would imply that the rich are buying bitcoin.  In reality, the dollars flow to early adopters like in a Kickstarter campaign -- a little bit at a time from a lot of people.  Whatever wealth the early miners will gain will be crowdsourced.

Right, so you have to account for opportunity costs when making decisions, I'm sure you know that.  You didn't break even in EUR, you *happened* to ride the price up until it matched your monetary cost and actually lost much more than you gained had you just bought bitcoin.
To use a rough analogy ... if you needed a car, instead of just buying it, you went out and got yourself a job at Toyota and waited for your employee discount to kick in "*to buy it cheaper*".  I'm sure you can say "it was fun", "I learned a lot", "I wanted to participate", "I had extra money", "it's a hobby", but it doesn't change the fact that you lost much more than you gained.

Precious metals bugs like Max Keiser, Peter Schiff, Marc Faber, Jeff Berwick, and dozens more have been yelling about hyperinflation for years.

I wouldn't call it genuinely superior myself.  There's 4x the coins, confirmation times is faster, and some block anti-spam measures.  The idea is still the same.
Personally, I like to read about cryptos that are actually different.  For example, PeerCoin is inflationary -- there's no limit.  Perhaps some banks or governments adopt something like that because everyone is used to the inflationary fiat paradigm for the last 100 years.
FreiCoin is also kind of cool.  Demurrage forces people to spend it because it continues to decay.  That idea essentially promotes 0% or negative interest rates, which is what the Fed has been doing since the crisis.

I've been raging about this too.  Adoption is not about great ideas.  Betamax was technically superior, but it didn't matter.  Adoption is also about clever marketing.  "Mu coin" is a stupid name, and "Satoshi" is too foreign-sounding.  The hordes of 24-year nerds who grew up on Pokemon and anime have no problem with that name, but a Billy Bob from Taylor, Texas probably would.
It will shake itself out.  If the exchange rate hovers above $1k, I think people will come up with new names and finally start using the word "bitcoin" do describe the network and the infrastructure instead of the magic internet tokens.

I know I guy who's trying to beat back 10 grand he'd sunk into a BFL miner (500 GH).  I think it was 50BTC+ when he preordered, and it shipped many months later.  He started mining in Nov, and two difficulty increases later he's down to maybe 0.3BTC a day.  He'll never, ever get that money back.  The only hope is to maybe make it up in dollars, which is also dumb because in that case he should have just bought BTC with dollars.
The only possible way to mine nowadays is be an insider on the next gen mining chip.  I'm talking be the first to plug in a battery of 10 TH miners and run them for 2-3 months non-stop.  All others are getting willingly fleeced.
We should not be surprised -- look at history.  As with any mania/gold rush, the support community always makes a killing, not the miners.

As someone who has to wire money around the world for business on top of sending money personally to my family in Eastern Europe, I see no pitfalls with bitcoin.  The only was to go from here is up.  I know the Internet analogy is fucked out, but I actually read the old forum replies to the guy who invented the World Wide Web protocol.  People were yelling at him for having the audacity to introduce hyperlinks and images.  I mean, why in the fuck would you want to send an image across the Internet?
In the end, criticizing cryptocurrency becomes analogous to criticizing the automobile, electricity, or computers.  These "pitfalls" are relatively small and manageable while the upside is massive.
Don't worry about the price in dollars.  All that means is that people are getting more interested.  People were not interested at 3 cents, mildly interested at $300, and now they are really fucking interested at $1,000.  It's not a price.  It's an "interest index".

I could have paid off the house and would have been debt free, free to pursue other, more interesting things in life and spend more time with my little boy.

You have to be very careful with those kinds of statements.  If you followed precious metals for any length of time, you'd hear that sentiment over and over again.  If I had an ounce for every time I heard "silver will never be under $20 ever again" because "LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY THE FED IS PRINTING OMG YOU GUISE !!!!1!!!"
People have bought in at $40+ into silver and $1,800+ into gold with crazy premiums, and they may not harvest any profit any time soon, possibly not even in their lifetimes.  Silver sat around $5 for like 20 years, through crazy cataclysms, wars, crises, and even the fall of the USSR.  It can happen again.

Right, as I said in the post, that could totally happen. But today, the supply of dollars is technically infinite. Any bank can ask the Fed or the IMF for more dollars if their economy is in a really rough shape.  How are they going to ask for more bitcoins to get liquidity?
Example.  Some crazy storm wipes Ukraine's cash crop.  The economy is in the shitter, and the banks stopped lending.  No new business activity can happen.  There is not enough currency to go around for basic economic activity.  The banks need to inflate a little until the next harvest, but they can't because they can't get enough bitcoin.  Then what?
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:59:26
I'm not sure I agree.  I was buying BTC on Mt. Gox with Dwolla at $5, and limits were actually higher than they are now.  Now BTC is sixty times more valuable, and limits are laughable -- 3BTC breaks the daily limit.  Nothing got structurally caught up in any way, shape, or form.

@_date: 2013-11-13 04:06:57
I have a few points to add, but I don't want to turn it into a circlejerk.
1. I'd be careful to conflate Bitcoin with "electronic money".  We already have the latter, and it's working fine.  Just because there's a bank between you and the vendor is not really making that money any less electronic.  If anything, I have a throat to choke if something goes wrong.
2. If one can't find a way to make passive money now, they won't be able to make it with Bitcoin, gold, seashells, or wampum.  Just because BTC is highly fungible and electronic doesn't negate the fact that one still needs to provide a good or a service that people want to buy.
3. Machines already run the current system.  Granted, they are old batch system bank machines from the 80s, but that in itself is not an issue.  They are complemented with modern real-time machines that allow you to see your transactions as you swipe.
4.  Again, you mention a lot of automation, which is great, except nothing is stopping people automating their goods and services into websites/kiosks and accepting anything from Visa to PayPal to Dwolla to Amazon tokens to dozens of other forms of payment.  If your business is running margins thin enough to not be able to pay credit card or PayPal fees, I think Bitcoin is not going to save you.
In the end, I am extremely optimistic about Bitcoin.  Even during these "bubble times" there are only a handful, just a few hundred people who can call themselves "Bitcoin millionaires".  I thought that number would be in the tens or even hundreds of thousands by now.  This means that we're still in Bitcoin's early infancy -- provided if we peeked into the future, we'd see the horny orange "B" plastered on every storefront.  At the same time, I want to be cautious and not get too geeked out.  As a kid, whenever I though that Santa FOR SURE was going to bring me that toy I always wanted, Santa had other ideas.  Sure, it'd be nice that everyone realize how much banks really suck and start using BTC, but if it doesn't happen, life goes on, moving on.

If it's too good to be true ... you know the rest.  Generally-speaking, you have to put in a hell of a lot of effort into a venture for it to pay greatly.  Basically, future success is a function of ideas, risk, and labor.  Stumbling into three bitcoins is neither risky no laborious.  In other words, even if your three coins do pay off greatly, you'll probably be dead by then.
Here is my two cents.  I don't think BTC will be a currency.  Governments around the world will go to war before they give up control of their currencies.  But ... bitcoin can easily become an escrow/title/transaction ledger.  Participating in one would require one to own some bitcoins in order to parcel them out.  This is where you come in.
Let's say in the distant future a single bitcoin is valued at $1,000,000.  Your grandkids have 3BTC.  A mortgage company decides to digitize all of their title work.  Bitcoin is a perfect solution -- every transaction is both public and private, secure, confirmed.  But the company needs 0.5BTC to divide it into 50,000,000 satoshis, each thus valued at $50.  Each satoshi represents a mortgage title changing hands.  They buy half a bitcoin from your grandchildren for half a mil.
