Most first world countries are moving towards increasingly mixed economic systems, though. Shit, the only Libertarian Utopia I can think of within recent memory is Somalia. Or Rapture. Or [Galt's Gulch.](

I just got it on PC and I'm really enjoying it. I got the Long War mod for it and that just makes it better. 
I watched ChristopherOdd's playthrough a bit before I made that decision.

Right? I just lost my job and, while I should have another job in the next week or so, I'm really hurting.

That's a new one.

Methadone. Methadone is what you're looking for. And I've done both the methadone and Suboxone thing, as well as Kratom for maintenance. I just don't really give a shit anymore. As hard as I work, shit never pans out, but at least I'm happy when I'm high.

I just used it to buy heroin so I never had any for long. But my preferred market shut down with 3 BTC in my wallet and I could really use that right now.

Not like it's stopped me so far.

I was clean for almost two years and I just relapsed.

Meh. I don't think I want to. I tend to hate myself less when I'm banging dope.

I'm confused about the meta but as far as I know, I am living my life.

That's one thing it absolutely won't do but I appreciate the thought.

I'd believe that more if Nixon didn't tell the North Vietnamese to tank the Peace talks in order to make LBJ look like shit and then spend 5 more years in Vietnam while expanding further and further into Laos and Cambodia.

Nixon may have intentionally prolonged the conflict to hedge his bets on the election but we were sending advisors under Kennedy and fully engaged under LBJ.
