It's not their location as much as their interaction with old timey banks. To provide the wire transfer capability, they are suddenly subject to banking regulations. 
It's a necessary evil, but I'm glad companies are taking it on. Coinbase and Circle just need plausible deniability so run your coins through some intermediate wallets or a join/shared situation.

Samir's shared secret approach is pretty good. The question is how many people and keys is the right number to be sure you won't be colluded against. 
If you have 3 people (family/friends) and a will, putting 2 in the will and then 1 to each of the 3 people and then requiring 4 keys to decrypt will keep you generally safe. 
If your will hasn't been executed and shared, the 3 people won't have enough information. If one of them dies or loses their key, the will can still provide enough info to allow decryption by the two others. 
Also, you probably don't want to hand over a private key for your nefarious purposes wallet because they'll be able to see which addresses were used and figure out what a weirdo you were. 
That said, you'll be dead.

BIP39 does this the other direction. 
Just generate a key the NsA can't guess and encode it in an English recovery phrase. 
The use the actual crypto key to store the credentials or whatever you're trying to hide.

I actually thought about this on my run a couple of days ago. 
I hadn't planned on actually investing but just including Bitcoin recovery phrases in my will for the people who I want to inherit things.  Since all of Bitcoin collects and loses value together and its finite, I don't see a benefit to letting a bank gamble with it while it's earmarked for a beneficiary.

"Trusts" is not plural on this case, just conjugated for the singular "who". 
I assume the sentence was like "They trust the blah" (they is plural) and the subject was changed to "who" (singular) but the verb conjugation wasn't updated.
