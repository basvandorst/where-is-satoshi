lol. Nice tree. The market is too bearish and hopes it won't last until next year. But the good thing to do now is to switch assets into stable coins to reduce the downside risk. [Cryptocurrencies.Ai]( Back-test Optimization tool will help you realize how much money you could save in losses since it provides an indicator on when to invest and when to go in a stable coin. Try the free beta platform now.

Agree on this one, but for now, since the majority of the altcoins are going down, you could definitely use the Optimization Tool of [Cryptocurrencies.Ai]( Platform to manage your portfolio. It will show you the performance of the coins by its back-test model and it will show you what percentage you should put on every coin you choose.  The free beta platform is currently up. Try it now.

Hahaha. Bearish Market. The only thing we can do is to hodL (hold) or trade frequently with minimal losses. Just like those known traders say, you can win or loss on your every trades but what you have to learn is to keep your losses small. Try [Cryptocurrencies.Ai]( free beta platform and use its Back-testing Optimization Tool so that you could realize how much money one could save in losses when we have a model which provides an indicator on when to invest and when to go in a stable coin.
