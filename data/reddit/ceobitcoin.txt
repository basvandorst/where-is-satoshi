Now there are only 5!? Where are the other 4? The quit? Hahaha this is hilarious. Banks will never do something to help bitcoin. They are just evil...

Take a job and ask to be paid in BTC. Or if you have lot of free time, play some faucets. There are thousands out there and if you have patience and dedication you can make quite good coins at the end of the week.

CEO of Bitcoin here. So what questions you have?
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:13:37
Yes people forget very easy who is really behind Coinbase... a bank 
@_date: 2015-10-20 22:19:46
Hi, CEO of Bitcoin here. If you like to invest in our company I would be very pleased to help you to acquire some shares of Bitcoin. Direct sale only for serious investors :)
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:45:21
Coinbase is just another bank.  
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:34:06
Don't forget who is behind Coinbase   
We have to find out also who is behind Gemini...
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:31:26
wait until they will be listed on bitcoinwisdom

Yes I remember that GG was winning a contest organized bu Citibank. Fishy. Everything is touched by a bank get "infected".
@_date: 2015-10-09 19:47:39
yes stocks today are all rigged...
@_date: 2015-10-09 19:46:50
I see you have the right numbers. I understand your point but still don't get your conclusion.  
Regarding what Andreas said... Bitcoin even if will not worth nothing, that "worth" will be expressed in fiat. So make sense to worth nothing because fiat will worth nothing soon.

streamium.io doesn't have anything to do with streamium.directory. There are 2 different things

To have a prove for your concerns make a test. Send them an email requesting a promo article for your business. They will not say yes and will accept your "indications" to what should contain that article with no verification from their side. They just want the money...  
And I'm sure they read this and will start shilling my words.  
And I think I saw months ago a post here regarding this "procedure" from somebody that tested all the bitcoin news sites.
@_date: 2015-10-08 19:38:56
Interesting. I saw many years ago the movie "They Live", didn't know that is also a documentary. Now I see that is even They Live 2 docu.  
Will take a look.

Somebody have to be the CEO Bitcoin no? Is all in the news :)
@_date: 2015-10-20 12:59:30
CEO of Bitcoin here. Sorry but our marketing department didn't agree to re-brand the name of our company. And also our service provider company Blockchain doesn't want a fusion/merge between our companies.
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:55:29
Yep I start that: instead of buying 6pack of beers I buy now only 3, the rest of money keep them and to buy btc.
@_date: 2015-10-09 19:54:03
Yes is quite weird this whole shilling about gemini all over the place. is like when Obama is about to say a lie... but all MSM is washing up all the words.
@_date: 2015-10-09 20:06:29
I heard a guy here many times saying that his paid in BTC. Maybe we should ask him? I don't remember the name but I think he said that he insisted to his boss until they paid him in BTC or something like that.
@_date: 2015-10-07 12:15:39
yeah young generation... these ?  No wonder we are in this deep shit now. Because NWO took good care to "educate" them.
@_date: 2015-10-09 18:30:09
wow, so how you manage to not use any bank?
@_date: 2015-10-07 11:47:48
Bitwala lost my trust when I saw that they link their name with "refugees" donations. Now they come up with these bombastic articles just to bring attention to them because they are losing clients.  
Hey CEO of Bitwala, I'm telling like CEO to CEO :), this is not the way to promote your services... shame on you.  
- Stop shilling about bitwala, we already know you are posting 99% about bitwala.
@_date: 2015-10-18 11:26:33
CEO of Bitcoin here. Do you want to buy some Bitcoin shares and invest in my company?  
Hahahaha man I don't know if I have to downvote or laughing... How the hell you compare a company market cap with a decentralized protocol? Are 2 big different things! You need to get back to school man.
@_date: 2015-10-09 19:59:44
yeah soon we will see that they will "operate" like Coinbase...
@_date: 2015-10-09 19:36:26
So did you donated using this fake page?
@_date: 2015-10-20 21:54:41

Joking! But man seriously stop saying "invest in Bitcoin". That's not the way it is...  
First watch this presentation of Andreas M. Antonopoulos ( then read his book Mastering Bitcoin, then come back here and put the right question.  
I think who told you about Bitcoin gave you the wrong info or missing the most important part.
