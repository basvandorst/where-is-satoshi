Dot com bubble was a US only bubble that popped at 1 trillion market cap. 
Crypto is worldwide and has never hit that market cap. Crypto IS a bubble IMO but we haven’t gone high enough for the burst.

Perfect with the imports for me. Had bittrex, coinbase, gdax and binance

Bitcoin.tax is what I used. Upload reports if transactions and it spits out tax forms without profits and losses. Cost me $30 though because I had over 20 transactions which I’m sure most of us do.

Everybody here so salty about talking facts. Technical analysis done on the charts show going to low 6’s maybe 5’s before total correction and bear market is over. 
It’s likely to dip lower but in crypto, anything is possible. Something could reverse the entire market instantly, nobody knows really.

It calculates the value at the time of purchase and sale. Any coin, so yeah every transaction is taken into account.

How many time is this going to be posted? Goddamn flooding reddit feeds, this child pornography is all over the goddamn internet and the internet isn’t illegal. 
Let’s be clear also, it’s links to it not actual media files so the clear approach, would be to take down those sites.

When you buy an alt coin you most likely are buying it with bitcoin, sometimes Ethereum correct? 
Let’s say you want to buy stellar lumens, one Stellar Lumen (XLM) cost .00004 Bitcoin (BTC).
So if you wanted 100 Lumens (XLM) you would have to pay .0004 Bitcoin (BTC). 
So essentially you buy the Alt coin by using Bitcoin, most are in Bitcoin prices not fiat currencies. 
Now when you bought those 100 Lumens, Bitcoin may have been at let’s say $10,000 USD. Now let’s say today Bitcoin plummeted down to $5,000 USD and Stellar Lumens stay at the same Bitcoin price of .00004 per Lumen (XLM). Your Lumens would now be worth the same amount of Bitcoin but since Bitcoins value was reduced by 50% from 10,000 to 5,000 your lumen price would be worth half the original USD but stay the same price of BTC.

I’m betting it dips one last time down into 5,000’s maybe low 5k.

Bitcoin.tax is exactly what you just described. Might cost you $30+ if depending on how many trades you made. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:43:33
Doubt it

The whole market will most likely be changed by then with introduction of fiat to alt coins. Bitcoin dominance over the entire market should come to an end this year. 
Bitcoin will still be a huge player and probably hold  market cap for a while but more and more alts will get fiat pairings. A big player getting ready to launch is Stellar’s new SDEX paired with FairX. 
Long story short, alts may not suffer the same way they did this year because when btc drowned in Q1 it took the entire market with it. I will most likely HODL through it as I did this year.
