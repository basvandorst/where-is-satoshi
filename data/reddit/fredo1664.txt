I often read that you should keep 5% of your investments in gold. I'm doing the same with bitcoins instead.
The idea is to have a few % of my investments as uncorrelated to the rest of the economy as possible. I'm not sure if bitcoins are ideal for that, but they sure are cool.

I just tried again and it worked. It's a bit slow but usable.
It acts strangely when the change is sent back to the sender address (blockchain's wallet ask for the change to be returned to the sender address by default). It show a lot of very small transactions, when blockchain.info only shows one with the correct amount returned. I'll PM you a transaction ID if you're interested.
