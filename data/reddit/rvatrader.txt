The recent action makes the casino look boring by comparison.

Clicked out of hope ... damn, guess I'm staying single in 2019.

I can't help but visualize the police scratching their heads and asking something remotely clueless like, "Have you tried going through your emails to find the missing coins?"

I'm flattered but nope, I mostly keep to myself. I have a financial background and find crypto compelling, so now that we're at a point where the regulated securities world is colliding with the digital asset class, I feel I could be of some contribution recently.
I'm grateful to have received a lot of insight personally from this community.

How do you feel non-government native Chinese feel about crypto from your personal experiences there?

That random walk seems to have been a good buy.

The way I see it is taxation is a rite of passage in the acceptance (legitimacy recognition) angle. As for adoption, it may be a trade-off. Short-term roadblock but long-term facilitator.

It could be the opposite, secular deflation, with cryptos still prospering. But, yes, hyperinflation is a sort of embedded right tail event (positive black swan) option within the digital currency asset class. Not something you HAVE to bet on, and probably not something I'd want if I'm honest.

Volatility serves to flush away the weak hands. The ultimate effect is stabilization and accumulation of conviction.

For the US, the question of "how much" is determined by which asset class it's taxed as. Currently I believe it's taxed as "property". However it may be more accurate under the "currency" bracket or a typical securities profile where long-term capital gains as well as short-term capital gains apply.
I can't speak in regards to how other nations should do it.

ETFs are required to hold the underlying asset, in this case the actual crypto, unlike futures or derivatives. As for gold, it isn't always better to own physical gold for a host of reasons, e.g. retirement account requirements, tax laws, security/storage, and liquidity. ETFs are also cheaper to hold despite fees short to medium-term due to initial physical bullion spreads.
I think of ETFs as "consumer-friendly" even if I am savvy enough to own it via cold storage. It should serve as an acceptance gateway as well as socioeconomic validation of the asset class.

Central banks -can- print money. That would be monetary inflation.
The deflation I'm concerned about would be the secular deflation of credit expansion or the demand for goods and services brought about by a stagnation in the economy. Similar to what happened to Japan the last 20-30 years.
And in this case if the central bank is accountable, they'd do exactly what Japan's central bank did. They wouldn't print money to exacerbate the current woes any further. Even if they did, it would actually help cryptos in this context due to the flight to safety effect. All of this happening under the grand backdrop of secular deflation.
