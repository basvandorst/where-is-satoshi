Hey did u delete your messages to me? I was just going to follow it. Just got my private key last night 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:05:23

Guess who got their btc back and ended up helping the guy out that actually tried instead of being a doubtful pessimist.

See I️ didn’t know that. Is it possible that my coins got messed up because I️ tried pruning with the 2014 version?

Ok thanks...

It’s definitely real btc I used to mine with btc guild and I moved a portion of it to blockchain.info and left the rest on the core wallet

When I enter privkey into electrum it won’t let me hit next. Btw just for some extra content on the main core page it says I have 0 btc/transactions, but when I hit debug it shows that I have 48 transactions.. also on the main page where it says I have 0 btc/transactions, there is writing above it that says warning: unknown rules activated versionbit1
Any advice? Btw I’m serious about giving btc to whoever helps me I feel like no one here took it seriously

Hey I got my coins back! It was as simple as downloading the latest version of bitcoin core wallet.. I had 14.2 I think it was and I downloaded the new one and it came back! But I’m still going to throw you some btc for the help man I really appreciate it. Send me your wallet!

It won’t let me just open with .dat file, it wants private key
