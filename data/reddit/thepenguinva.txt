And a third thing that looks like a hub or switch but there's nothing plugged into it.

Sure.

No, though there is one there too. Or used to be.

Is there a bylaw requiring you to put up the sign, or just working in good faith with the police?

Nice. I like.

Agreed. I work at a high traffic location that sells iTunes cards (among other things) and we have all received similar training. So many scams against older people and newly arrived people to this country. My grandfather tried to withdraw $15000 to send to someone who called to inform him I had crashed my car (I don't drive.). Luckily his bank manager wouldn't let him without calling me first.

Automatic Teller Machine.
Nothing to do with cash. It replaces what a bank teller would do. If bitcoin had a physical bank, presumably the teller would help you buy and sell bitcoin. To call something an "ATM" these days is almost always archaic terminology, but the fact that it's for bitcoin doesn't make it any more or less so, IMO.
Edit: Fun fact, in Canada they are almost always now referred to as "ABM", Automatic Banking Machine. It's a little more correct. But only a little.

I have been in the bitcoin world for a while, but still a relative newbie. I use bitcoin core. Have for about four years. Should I use something else? The amount of bitcoin I own is extremely small.

You are part of “the dumbest amongst us” that the person you replied to mentioned. But don’t worry, even the dumbest amongst us are smart enough to consider crypto!
