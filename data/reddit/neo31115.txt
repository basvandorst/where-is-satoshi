Yes but that would slow down Bitcoin's growth and usage by a tremendous amount. They'll try.
@_date: 2011-06-22 02:14:46
OK that is just ridiculous. Is it that slow because of tradehill confirming it or is that standard with Dwolla? I'm pretty sure the advantage of Dwolla is that once the funds are in your Dwolla account, you can send them to any other Dwolla account INSTANTLY since it is the SAME SYSTEM. It's kind of like sending bitcoins directly to someone but instead of the network confirming the transactions, Dwolla confirms the transaction BECAUSE ITS THEMSELF!! ugh this really ticks me off.

Also don't forget that using bitcoins offers certain advantages over fiat currency. You can transfer them to anyone in the world over the internet and under a veil of privacy.

I was led to believe that there are no scalability problems with Bitcoin. As far as upgrade-ability, I was under the impression that 21 million bitcoins with 8 decimal place subdivisions could last over 100 years.

Do it! Here is an example widget on a webpage: 
@_date: 2011-06-09 23:57:29
just compress and (optionally but recommended) encrypt your wallet.dat file and upload it to a website or something like Google Docs or E-mail.
@_date: 2011-06-21 11:57:25
at that rate it seems they would need 1,000 computers with ATI cards... IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!

It sounds kind of like using a fiat currency that is backed by gold. Just like you have to trust the bank that you can exchange your bills at any time for solid gold, you have to trust the issuing entity that they'll never issue any duplicates, and that you can exchange your bitbills at any time for real digital bitcoins. 
@_date: 2011-06-07 01:34:33
I think it's a great idea but the reason why it is harder to use than bitcoin for trading/purchases (and its already hard with bitcoin) is that you have to at least gain trust with a few other people or else you can't do anything on the system. None of my friends have bitcoins (even though some know about it) but that's OK... they certainly don't have a node connected with Ripple.
@_date: 2011-06-09 02:57:28
it's still a single point of failure which means someone can possible hack or force his way in (subpoena?)

Ok these exchanges need to start implementing HUGE security features...mobile verification, cookie checks, sha256 or better, massive firewalls,  etc.

I'm against pool mining but it's fine if it stays below lets say 10% of the entire network CPU power.
@_date: 2011-06-21 11:59:38
details still developing as now people are finding evidence that there were in fact more SQL injection vulnerabilities in the MtGox website which is probably why they are not re-opening the site... they just don't trust their code anymore.
@_date: 2011-06-20 17:11:34
good point, there really was no alternative. TradeHill is clunky and slow as molasses. Seems like my deposits don't work unless I e-mail them about it. 
But I think it stresses the point that bitcoin is not supposed to be about  these fiat&lt;-&gt;bitcoin exchange sites.  
For it to be truly person to person, we just have to deal directly with each other, trading goods/services for bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:29:55
Yes, I believe 7-zip.org archiver (free software) can encrypt the file.

Site looks like it works, but login button does nothing (doesn't refresh the page, no javascript actions, nothing). This seems like a coding error and that is sad
@_date: 2011-06-25 17:46:37
ah. I'm on Ubuntu -- loaded up Firefox and it logged in. Pretty sad they have something that doesn't work in Chrome but works in Firefox and IE. that is usually a sign of bad programming (if it doesn't work in IE, it's acceptable)
@_date: 2011-06-10 01:12:21
OK so general consensus is backup often, but you don't have to backup after EVERY transaction.
@_date: 2011-06-03 13:30:54
Right now the easiest thing may be selling items, perhaps via eBay and accepting bitcoins as payment. 
@_date: 2011-06-27 17:46:34
and gold, silver, diamonds, and clams.
@_date: 2011-06-21 11:55:22
thats a pretty good idea, but I don't agree with the decentralized nature of pools. 
I do hate when my password gets stolen though, and I am lucky I started using LastPass a few months ago. Used a fresh random password for MtGox so when they were hacked (as many are nowadays), all my other accounts were fine. I hate that I have a single point of failure though now (LastPass).
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:34:27
i'm pretty annoyed, its been down for me for a day
@_date: 2011-06-25 16:52:10
It didn't work for me in Chrome, then I tried Firefox, and it logged in. Or, it could be LastPass screwing it up.
@_date: 2011-06-06 13:26:26
Don't forget: You would have to control 50% of the network power to bend the bitcoin rules. If quantum computers became the norm, they would probably be used on the "good" side as well as the "bad" so the balance would still be what it is today (mostly good).
@_date: 2011-05-07 14:33:31
It's kind of like finding the value of 1/0. You'll get infinitely closer to that value but never reach it.

Anger problem? You might want to look at 
@_date: 2011-05-27 03:47:22
Perhaps I should have used the term "shady" instead of "unstable". I don't want to say that bitcoins are stable. I don't know enough (or really anything) about economics to say that. Anyway, I didn't properly answer the OP's question. 
OP, of course you wouldn't want to convert *all* of your current currency into bitcoins, unless there is something in the short term you want to buy with bitcoins instead of USD (see bullets 1 and 2).
@_date: 2011-06-27 17:39:07
haha my thoughts exactly, or at least the next mega crash (may be one and the same)
@_date: 2011-06-04 17:10:21
haha. I'm not as crazy as you on it but I have been thinking about it all the time. It just opens so many new opportunities that weren't possible before. Much like the internet opened a huge amount of communication possibilities around the world in the 1990s.
@_date: 2011-06-08 19:49:13
are you the guy that made the youtube videos of his basement setup? and the laptop presentation?
@_date: 2011-06-21 13:52:33
Yup it is gone the instant you send it. The transaction status says "Sent" so not sure if that means "received" or just that I sent it. 
@_date: 2011-05-27 02:34:22
* You can send bitcoins directly to anyone in the world with an internet connection, without paying any kind of transaction fee.
* If you do it right, the transaction is anonymous.
* Federal currencies are ~~unstable~~ shady (well the USD is) because the flow is controlled by a group of people behind closed doors, and people are prone to greed and corruption. Bitcoin economy is controlled by cryptographic principles and all transactions are clear and open (but still of course anonymous).

It is up for me. I withdrew my bitcoins and now just have 0.76 USD with a $0.05 USD per BTC order. lol

@_date: 2011-06-09 23:59:59
Another question related to this: let's say you have 50 BTC and you backup your wallet.dat file. Later that day, you spend 10 BTC and now have 40 BTC. Your hard drive crashes and you have to restore the file (from when you had 50 BTC). Can you restore your 40 BTC or is everything lost?
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:36:43
I can confirm that the passwords were probably decrypted...why? Gmail locked my account when someone tried to login. Thankfully my MtGox password was unique so I am safe.

$40 for 12 months of xbox live gold? Is that really true? and additional 20% off that for using bitcoins?

A handy calculator would still be needed.
@_date: 2011-06-02 03:50:05
ah yes thank you.
@_date: 2011-06-21 02:20:53
if you're worried about time, you don't have to use bcrypt. 
1. hash password with SHA256 or SHA512 (with salt function, etc)
2. look up username and hashed password in database
3. pause execution for 500 milliseconds (modify sleep time as needed)
And you've just replicated the benefits of bcrypt according to that article's author.

One other thing: I reported a problem with TradeHill's site a week ago, in regards to URL encoding the user's e-mail address when generating a Dwolla request link, because they are not currently doing that. They still didn't fix this so the links won't work if you have a plus sign in your e-mail.  If they don't do something as simple as this I would be very wary to trust them on maintaining security.
@_date: 2011-06-17 02:49:31
it was only a matter of time before this started happening. I recommend using Linux full time or if you still use windows, run Bitcoin inside an Ubuntu virtual machine. 
@_date: 2011-05-27 03:50:16
its going to be fun nick-naming fractions of bitcoins. How about **bit** for .01 bitcoins? It will be interesting to see what develops in the community.

Ironically, even without a central authority inherent to the system, a "central authority" has arisen by a mass of unknowing miners blindly giving their GPU powers to a single entity. This is *very bad*
