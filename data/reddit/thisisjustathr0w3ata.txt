Buffet has a deep understanding of the investments he makes. Bitcoin is a technology, and if you can't explain it well to someone else, then there's no reason for you to opine on it. Buffet doesn't have a worthwhile thought on Bitcoin.

You're mistaken. They only insure their hot-wallet, which is their operating wallet -- not yours. The wording in the support article says this, people choose to read it incorrectly.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:19:42
Well, you can. Assuming you have accounts in both places you send $17,000 from your bank to Kraken. That takes one day if you bank wire it. You buy 1 BTC. Now you send 1 BTC from Kraken to GDAX. You sell 1 BTC for $17,100. You wire $17,100 to your bank and it takes one day. Wire fees eat about $40 round trip minimum. But let's scale it up to 10 BTC. Now your profit every two days is about $960. Not bad for two days! But you will need $170,000 minimum cash on hand. So the answer to your question is a question -- how much capital do you have? And secondarily, would you have made more by hodling?
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:06:31
I've been in Bitcoin since 2009, on and off. Mined, used, spent, cashed out, bought back in, hodl, gain, lose worked at bitcoin companies... And I still think in dollars. Just like everyone else does. Being new doesn't matter, dollars makes the world go 'round still.

Doesn't matter if you're lying. The point is the post doesn't contribute anything. We see a constant stream of "zomg I found some BTC that I forgot about!" -- "don't make my mistake, I made a bad trade" and recently people with zero finance knowledge or experience commenting on futures trading. It's like high school. Nobody needs to know you found Bitcoin ffs.

This is the line that I read that's incorrect. Customer funds are not stored in the hot wallet, it is not custodial. It's an operational wallet for external transactions. If the hot wallet was somehow hacked and lost, no customer funds would be affected or lost.
@_date: 2018-09-21 06:21:22
We already knew this step was coming, at the last announcement. This entire process is fully documented in advance and people still act surprised as it unfolds in schedule and as described in all documents and announcements.  Their stance makes sense from what I've read so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:09:45
Not quite right - the hot wallet is not customer funds. It is the operating wallet for coinbase.

If you work somewhere, it's smart to negotiate terms. This is not just when you are starting, and applies for ongoing employment too. Employment is a two-way agreement and there's no need to accept terms you don't like when they can be negotiated to benefit you. Employers are not our benevolent overlords that get to dictate terms.

Approval / disapproval is based on the setup of the ETF meeting the necessary requirements. When they declined the Winklevoss ETF they gave a bunch of reasons why it was being declined. This application may have different problems, but we won't know until the latest possible date (early next year) when they approve or decline this one and give the list of those problems.

It may be worth making a distinction between fractional reserve and an outright scam. Banks are completely open about having fractional reserves, and that's their business model. Everyone participates knowingly. 
A crypto exchange with fractional reserves would have to put that in their terms, otherwise it's not fractional reserve, it's just a scam where they are stealing people's funds.

If you buy some BTC for $200 then you have $200 worth of BTC. It doesn't matter if that is 1.2 BTC or 0.001 BTC. It's still the same amount of value or spending power at the time of conversion. If you want a fix for that, find a crypto without a limited number in existence. Then you could create as many as you like, allowing everyone to own 1:1. Like Tether...

ICE owns NYSE. NYSE is an investor in Coinbase. Why do news outlets not mention this basic stuff? When someone at ICE or NYSE says anything positive about Bitcoin, it's because their future is intimately linked to the outcome. Always.

I assume you're asking about the price in USD. In that case I wouldn't necessarily want the price to go up. I want Bitcoin to be widely used and supported in many different ways. For that to be the case, the price between BTC and USD needs to reach equilibrium as a matter of course. For most people, their spending power will be about the same when they convert so it doesn't matter.

We're beyond most people in the world being able to own 0.28 bitcoin. That happened when it hit $1000. People in the US can't  afford that - a single bitcoin is a blurry untouchable dream. If you take 21,000,000 and divide that evenly across just the US population (about 327,368,831) each person would get 0.06414782 BTC. It's scarce.

The most basic valuation formula is to work out how much money a company is expected to make in the future. Total. So coinbase didn't make any money until last year. But they made $1B. That's a lot. It's easy to see they can be worth a lot more than $8B without anything changing.

The halving of Bitcoin block rewards is not the same as market supply. On the day of halving, the supply of BTC available in the market could drop, rise, or stay the same. You're confusing the number of Bitcoin available for sale with the number of new Bitcoin being mined. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:39:21
Mining businesses are vc funded, and some have made millions already that they're holding. The assumption that miners constantly sell, or even that they need to sell at all, is incorrect. That wouldn't be a good business model.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:07:59
1 - key difference is there's no regulation around publishing trades because Bitcoin is not a security. 
2 - The block trading companies that operate in the crypto space do a lot of volume, and they have zero obligation to report it anywhere. 
3 - Those block trading companies go to exchanges, and each other, and large volume traders (businesses, and individuals) to make their trades.
4 - Entities trading at this level include some of the following: Investors in the crypto space. Individuals. Crypto businesses. Exchanges. Merchants. ICO projects. Traders. Family offices. And more...
5 - What effect they have is the same as other buying and selling. The price moves up and down, and liquidity is provided or removed as the trades are offered and filled.
