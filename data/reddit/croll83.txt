For merchant the benefits are: 
- the payment can't be reversed (stealed CCs)
- less processing fees
- can sell item without needs of a customer registration and verification -&gt; very simple process
For security they can always use a multisig address (2of3 or 3of5 private keys to move the funds.
For volatility they can always convert to FIAT without a processor but with an exchange for example, at least a part of them...
For 51% you are right...

Blockchain.info let you query all transaction for a defined address, but is not the best way to implement your needs.. you need to check every 'x' minutes the address and check if there are new transactions. You need something that calls a script on your website when new transaction are received (AND CONFIRMED AT LEAST 2/3 TIMES)... As I know you can do it with official bitcoin client api, but in that case it would be referred to your address, don't know if it can already handle 'watchonly addresses'...

Yes You can! with multisig.  has Instant Confirmation feature, but who is accepting bitcoin must trust greenaddress. It works this way: you have 1pk of a 3of2 address. the other pk is owned by greenaddress. When you send btc to your friend greenaddress automatically sign trx with 2pk and it is verified by miners. if you try to doublespend and you did used 'instant confirmation feature' greenadrress intercept the double spend request and simply don't sign trx with their 2pk, so 2nd trx (the double spended) will be never verified by miners. but your friend (or merchat) should trust greenaddress feature, because the trx will be unverified for 10min as a normal transanction.

Greenaddress.it it's a multisig wallet. They hold 1 pk and you the other one.

@_date: 2014-06-18 06:40:07
Beacuse theorically you can trade them: if you are lucky enough, you buy 100gh/s for 400$, take mining earnings (every 10 minutes) for a month and sell gh/s. If you are lucky the gh/s price will still be the same or even higher and you make profit both from mining and gh/s selling...
Reality: watch the graph, gh/s price is always dropping.. I tryed 2 times to test the business, buy-in and out after a while, in both cases I entered on cex.io with 3BTC and went out with more or less 3BTC (including mined earning)... Not profitable for me...
At the end I saw part of my 3Btc converted some crappy altcoins mined (NMC, IDC, ecc..)...

Well, actually people in Italy paid for IMU with Monti and now they are paying Tasi (that is more expensive than IMU itself)... we are the kind of people that are used to say: 'new tax? Shit!  Bla bla bla bla' and then when the deadline came up we shout up our mouth and pay... and this happen always!!! We are great speaker but that's all... 
Coming to the main topic: IMO bitcoin can grow up in Italy in two different ways: from the roots (just like you said: brik'n mortar bitcoin POS near univesities) or from the top (government and institution will say: 'ok, bitcoin is a way to attract new business like NL, UK or Germany'). Guys from Coincapital and Cashlessway are doing very well with the government approach, now we need to be more compact as community and start to operate from the roots point of view...

They are two opposite things... colored coin let you color some bitcoin in order to produce a subset of coin that belongs the same blockchain protocols (confirmation time, block size, proof-of-work, etc keeps unaltered). With side chain you can create your own blockchain behaviour that can be completely different. The innovation with sidechain is that you can keep the main blockchain hash power and you can move bitcoin between the main blockchain and the sidechain...

I also bought some ether few hours ago. 
DAC/DAO and smartcontract are technology parallel to "Bitcoin as currency", and when CoreDevs will decides to support sidechains I'm pretty almost sure that Ethereum will fork. 
Finally Ether is only the 'fuel' to make ethereum operations. Derivative products will continue to support Bitcoin, so they are stricly connected.
With this in mind, not supporting ethereum in favour of Bitcoin is like buttercoiners that don't support Bitcoin in favour of $s...

| "They can't be double spent as far as I know so they dont seem to rely on blocks being verified."
As I know, this is not true. You can send some colored to an address and watch them appear instantly on that address, but it must be verified by miners, if not you will double spend. It's totally equals to Bitcoin. Try to send some with 0 fees and check it yourself.
| "Would it be possible to use these assets as a switch (say on a gambling site) for instant server recognition without account creation?"
This is the same with Bitcoin. You can send bitcoin to gambling sites and they will find them instantly. But to avoid double spending they require confirmations. That will be the same with colored...

It's a matter of protocol: a single block can be more or less 1Mb and since a single raw transaction is more or less 0.28Kb it means that 0,28Kb * X tx/s * 60sec * 10min = 1Mb... so the X is 7tx/s.
To change this value, the protocol should change block size (increase bandwidth consumption and slow down the network) or decrease the block timing from 10m to 5m (decrease network security)...
As now is not necessary because the tx/s limit is still not saturated, no modification will be done... of course in future something should be done, but imho can be done a sort of priority: bigger transaction can be put in the low priority queue in order to give precedence to smaller transaction: if pay your coffee with bitcoin you need confirmation asap, if you send 1m $ with bitcoin you can wait also for several hours...
At the end visa processes 160m tx, but they don't clear it after few minutes like bitcoin: you need at least 2 days to see the visa transaction confirmed... so it's much more slower than bitcoin. The difference is that Visa is like the Blockchain for Bitcoin, so they confirm that you have the money to pay your coffee, but your money goes to the merchant only after the clearing... it's a matter of trust of the merchant in Visa's word...
Maybe in future Blockchain.info or Coinbase will start to gain this trust so merchant can sell goods without waiting for confirmation and the transaction can be cleared on blockchain even after 1 day... (this is alreasy happening with coinbase off-blockchain transaction)... no protocol should changes will be needed...

Keep in mind that is USD volume... In November 1BTC was  so 10BTC/day of volume was 12K$/day.. now the same volume would be 5.8K/day (more than 50% less)...
BTC volume is decreased over time in any case, but it's normal for several reasons: ex. if you buy it  and its value is now 575$ and news everywhere tells you that it will grow up to 3-5K$ you don't use that BTC, you hold it until you can...
IMO r/Bitcoin users should change approach: tell people to spend their bitcoin, stop talking about price, start telling them that probably the best that they can expect is 600$ and you will see how the BTC economy will start to grow again...

At the end if I limit your purchase for first 90days it's like with bitcoin: exchangers will wait for 6 conf (90 days) from the first payment... if no chageback then nolimits... yes, confirmation time is a bit longer then bitcoin, but it should work! This is a frictionless way to buy bitcoin and this open the doors for mass adoption:

I'll try to explain in ELI5, i'm going to simplify the process so it would not be accurate to reality but hopefully you can understand it: 10 minutes is the average time that a miner need to solve a matematical problem. The difficulty of the problem is variable from block to block in order that if new powerful miners come out and solve the problem in 6 min, the next block became more difficult to solve and it will require 10minutes again. The 10min is chosen at protocol level in order to be not so small and not so high. It is related to the network security: if it would be smaller a malicious miner with enough computational power could produce 2 blocks (say block N-1 and block N) in the time needed to produce only one by other miners, so it could rewrite some transaction in the block N-1 creating a longer chain in a smaller time. Using 10minutes is strong enough because is veru difficult to solve a block in less than 5minutes.

Money loundering? They accept only cryptopayments, this is not money loundering... they make money from arbitrage, so they use the spread between btce and bitfinex for example (11$) so they buy bitcoin on btc-e and sell them to finex at 11$ more, so they produce earnings even if the price is going down... maybe if the price goes up the spread may reduces and they can loose money...
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:27:09
it depends on where you are from... in EU I would say with SEPA transfer to exchangers like bitfinex and then buy with limit orders (it will take some time to buy 60k$ of bitcoin at a fixed price because you will have to create order and then cancel it and create a new one at a different price when you see that previous order is not completely filled and no-one is buying your dollars)...
if you want your BTC in few times or don't have sepa, contact a Bitcoin trader on reddit.comthey will charge you about 5% but you will have your bitcoin in small time and without moving the price (like you would do using market orders on bitfinex or any other exchanger)...

eBay could operate as eScrow making some business on the service. They can use a code assigned to the merchant that will be shipped with the item and used by the buyers to unlock the payment. Moreover if they will do a job like coinbase, the merchant could decide to convert to fiat as soon as the payment is sent from acquirer and collect it as soon as is released from eBay, just to mitigate volatily..
It would be a great business for everybody :D

IMO Btc won't go anywhere for this month because of whales. The big news will be that this guy is starting to accept Bitcoin on his own business... I'm just waiting as hell the moment that the fucking whales turn from bearish to bullish... that is the only way we can see a spike in the price...

@_date: 2015-01-02 18:59:13
This happens because bitcoin core is the standard wallet that download the full blockchain. There are 5 types of bitcoin wallet:
- full wallet (Bitcoin core) they need a full blockchain
- spv wallet (multibit) they download only block header of blockchain. These wallet needs 20min with HDSL internet connection to sync
- online wallet (blockchain.info) they don't need any software. The encrypted wallet is online and you download it with browser in few seconds and open it with your password
- paper wallet (bitaddress.org) you print public/private key on a paper and send bitcoin to its pulic address. since there is no software you can't send bitcoin untill you import this wallet on other type of wallet like SPV wallet
- hardware wallet (trezor) don't need the blockchain but you need to buy it and wait for the shipping time
I would reccomend you to use SPV wallet like multibit or online wallet like greenaddress.it for your scope.

Ok, now I got your point... you should put in the OP, because it seems like  a scam. Yep, the "Average BitJoe" can't perform a double spend, but what about a solo miner? He can relay the double spended transaction, but it would be a risk also for him... confirmation (at least 1) is needed to avoid double spend.

Bitstamp is too expensive to use as exchanger for volumes of Bitpay (0.5% plus deposit and withdrawal fees)... Coinbase exchange bitcoin internally selling to its own users... both of them uses OTC. There are many other exchangers out there... cheaper and more serious than Bitstamp...

AutomaticTransfer. They use webinjection to modify html rendered by your browser: you will see 'security verification, type your otp password to unlock the account, but the real website that you are browsing is a wiretransfer page... you don't see it nothing but the security fake message. You insert your otp and boom... wiretransfer is sent... you will notice only when you will go to atm and realize that no money are present on the account... they modifiy also balance and sometimes also statements...

Hi dan_held, tnx for the clarification! Firstly I would like to thank you for the great work that you all are doing there and the big effort you are putting into. Well, Facebook as always is full of limitation but I think that tip on comments would be the rigth way to mainstream. They speak only one language: profit. You guys probably need to speak the same language with them. I'm quite sure that if you find a way to share your profit with Facebook they will let you tip on wherever you want, but then comes tech limitations with complex facebook privacy rules. I would recommend you to don't stop developing this integration, because rigth now is quite useless. Good luck!

You simply can't use the Coinbase Exchange. It's available in 25 US states only. You are stucked to older Coinbase brokerage, so you can buy only at their price. More or less is like bittylicious that let you instant buy bitcoin with credit card if you are from UK... you can also try Kraken, is very oriented to security but volume is much lower than bitstamp, so if you have to buy more then 10BTC you can wait for long time for your limit order to be processed...

As I understood you can only tip from ChangeTip website :(
EDIT: you log in to ChangeTip Website, on the home page, on top (where you have "Send a tip on Twitter") you should click on facebook button on the right and then type your friend's name and the amount. Then hit "preview" and a Facebook share box will open. You put in your comment and it will create a new post. 
If this is the only way is quite useless and not user friendly...

Open Bazar  is an Open Source software that you can download from GitHub  ( and run on your pc, just like Bitcoin client or Multibit... it let you open an eBay-Like store where you can list your item. It's free, dosen't require subscription, all transaction are done without any commission. It's decentralized, so there's no server that can be hacked or seized by FBI. No company behind. Payments are done only in bitcoin, from buyer to seller, this means that no charge back can be done to you as a merchant. Plus it provides buyers pseudoanonymate. Go to check it and support it, it will blow your mind.. it's just a matter of time.

It's because when you create a Bitcoin transaction from the unused address, it means that you are creating a string that contains your public key hash, dest address, amount, and others info and then you sign it with the connected private key (raw transaction). Inside this raw transaction you expose your public key (not your address that is an hash of the public key, but the entire public key). This exposure can limit the number of private key that a very powerful machine have to generate before it generates your real private key and stole your funds. Bitcoin address generation could be overlapped: with a bad random number generator you can create the same private key two times. It's very difficult because there are more private key than you can imagine (it is really more than you can imagine), but if you expose your public key you will limit such number to a smaller one. Today you can still feel safe if you used a good random number generation when creating private key, but with computational power that comes in the following years it can be nomore safe so someone can generate the same private key.

Search for all files with name wallet.dat under the folder C:\Users\&lt;Your Username&gt;\AppData, backup them and then open one by one in the bitcoin client, get each public key and check its balance on blockchain.info. I hope that the refresh didn't wiped the AppData folder...

Online purchases requires VBV or MCSC from most website, the payment is authorized but the shipment requires days and in the meantime legit owner can see the transaction and block the card in time so the hacker's order can be deleted. With applepay you can pay in presence, this means hacker pays, take goods, go away and only after a while the legit owner will block the card.
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:33:31
It depends on your country. In EU we have a regulation called 'liability shift': Visa and Mastercard provides security standards (Vbv, mcsc), PCI-DSS, etc.. as long as you merchant/processor/reseller implement such process you won't have a chargeback if someone pays you with a stolen cc. They take the responsibility to refund customer. If you don't implement security measures you will become liable and you will have a chargeback.

We well see another pump of the price. Do you know how many account on stamp shorted btc because of the downtrend channel that we was having? So you can imagine how much fiat are on the stamp users' account. IMO they are going to buy btc with remaining fiat in order to withdraw them and put on other exchanges... and this will absolutely drive the price up because nobody want to sell btc on stamp and hope for a SEPA or a wire... we can possible see another gox story with another 1000$/Btc but then on other exchangers? What will happen?

Or we could see Amazon Bitcoin Wallet with their multisig and nlocktime and you would be forced to use their wallet. They can trust your instant confirmations and your user experience would be scan&amp;pay&amp;go... but that's not the problem. why this would improve adoption? What are user's benefits? Key management? Average user would pay x% to a key management service == banks. Even if there are advantages from user's perspective, it would impact price.
Amazon would use processors like BitPay, or even create AmazonPay but you can be sure that they would sell every satoshi and create a huge selling pressure.

Hi DjDopesauce and welcome onboard. When you make transaction with bitcoin these are irreversible. When you make transaction with fiat currency they are always revertible. So when you buy bitcoin with fiat who is selling you bitcoin is totally sure that such amount of bitcoin will never be reverted, but he is taking fiat from you that can be reverted and at the end of the day he can find himself without fiat and without bitcoin if you ask to your bank to reverse the payment because it was a fraud abuse of your account. To protect themself, who is selling you bitcoin wants to know everything about you so in case he can request your fiat even if you try to chargeback because he can prove that it was not fraudolent abuse of your bank account. Plus all current exchange, to be safe against laws and government, must implement AML/KYC policies that require you to identify. Some exchange like Robocoin Kiosk take you a palm and vein scan, some other request you a selphie with your id in your hand. Don't warry, it's normal practice. You should do it just one time,then it will be very simple procedure.

1/2) Coinbase, Kraken, Bitfinex, ecc are exchangers, they couples the offers/demands: people want sell their bitcoins at x$, others want buy bitcoins at y$, they match all orders and execute them, so you can give your dollars to them and buy bitcoins from people who are selling, or viceversa. In order to use them, you just need to register to your favorite exchanger and deposit dollars or bitcoins. For security reasons you need to verify your identity. In this case you don't need a bitcoin wallet, you can leave your bitcoins there (at your own risks - read about MtGox scam). Of course you can buy/sell bitcoins in person (see localbitcoin or Facebook groups) or even with an atm (find them with coinatmradar). In this cases you need to have your own bitcoin wallet (see sidebar for more links, i would recommend Mycelium and GreenAddress.it). There are also online managed wallets (Coinbase for example), they are like fiat banks: you don't control your bitcoins, they can seize your funds or even run away, but they are more user friendly, you just need to remember username/password (and think about that if you use real bitcoin wallets you need to make backups of the keys - or just a passphrase-, if not you will risk to lose them forever, nobody can give them back, there is no 'forgot password' link or even a support desk). Online wallet example is also valid for the exchangers. You have to decide basing on your skills.
3) as i know copay is a multisignature wallet, more or less like greenaddress.it, it means that you can create wallet controlled by 3,5,7...15 individuals and funds can be spent only if there will be 2,4,6...14 individuals that authorize transaction. As greenaddress.it, it is not an online managed wallet. You will have the full control of your funds. It just give you more security.

Don't agree here. Cryptocurrencies has properties that fiat money don't: programmable money, smart contract, dac/dao, speed, reliability. Sure you can do all blockchain related stuff with SQL, but then you are going to lose the best thing that blockchain give to you: transparency. I can imagine a state that control a public blockchain where citizens can control the state. The state can make their addresses known to public in order to let people know where politicians are moving funds, how they spend people's money. That's something that without a blockchain is not easy to achieve. You would need big datacenters, very well engineered system, etc... you already have all of this with Bitcoin. You can see that is reliable, hacker proof system much better than actual banking system. You just need to find a way to centralize mining and control address creation and you are close to realize an elettronic system that is better than multimillion software that is used by actual banks. BTW I'm working on a similar project (by myself) since december 2014.
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:33:43
I think I got it... seems like bitcoins are destoyed and recreated on each transaction. Blockchain only got informations about transactions, so each new transaction loses the information about the origin of the coins.. I think this behaviur can be achieved only using HD wallets and generating new different address on each transaction, even the receiving ones. Tracking all transaction and follwing only address can bring you to the originating transaction.

You can be enough safe having your weekly spending stash on your NOT ROOTED android mobile phone and the big stash on a paper wallet.

Yep. UASF supports any 1Mb block that signal (and later on includes) segwit. BTC1 (Segwit2X) will start produce 2Mb blocks in November. UASF will not support them...
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:04:55
Nope.. do not agree... 148 segwit blocks must have 1mb max of unsigned tx data. The rest of about 3Mb is for witness. If 2x will come in play we will have 2mb of unsigned tx data. If 1.1mb of tx will arrive then 148 will discard it.

You are right, they are mixed, but not only at exchange level, but also on single transaction level. Imagine you have address A where you receive 0.3BTC (newly generated from block 200001) from address B and 0.2BTC (newly generated from block 200005) from address C. Now you have 0.5BTC on address A. If you send 0.4BTC to address D there is a way to know that 0.1BTC is belonging to block 200005 and 0.3 is belonging to block 200001?
