Two things you should know;
1. You likely won't make any money from mining unless you invest in a substantial operation. If you are doing it for fun, then by all means.
2. There are a HUGE number of scams when it comes to mining equipment - mainly because it doesn't make economic sense to sell cutting edge miners until they are obsolete.

Guys, real arbitrage opportunities do not last long - so if there has been an arbitrage opportunity for a while across two exchanges; there is likely a very good reason for it (probably related to delays in processing withdrawals) - go for this at your own risk.

Surely, assuming the key is generated securely, using a paper wallet for 'cold storage', where the private key will only be used once to empty the wallet when you want to withdraw funds from your cold storage, is a perfectly fine use case.
What is your strategy for cold storage of bitcoins?

Yep, also the 17% mining from an unknown location.
This is why I'm a bear about BTC, the 51% attack is a real problem. Governments could sink billions into such an attack. Doesn't even have to be by directly buying miners.

A bitcoin exchange (MtGox), where one could trade government issued paper money for bitcoin, has been in the pits for months. They weren't processing withdrawals in a timely manner for a long time, so people couldn't get their assets out of the exchange.
Recently, they claimed this was due to a flaw in the bitcoin protocol, when in fact it was a flaw in their implementation. They have completely stopped processing withdrawals in bitcoin. As such, everyone on that exchange is trying to sell their bitcoins for cash so they can at least get some money out of the burning building.
Additionally, a black marketplace build on the reputation of another, now dead, black market place has lost a lot of people's bitcoins. They claim they were hacked, as a result of the same implementation issue that MtGox suffered from, but this seems very unlikely and as such they are being accused of theft.

In reality though, they would create paper money IOUs backed with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:39:54
could be because of the block size limits? To get to the desired BTC per wallet you'd need to have tens of thousands of outputs.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:35:51
Well, yes. Salts should always be applied. If salting with the username or email they would need to pepper it with something site unique too. This would apply if they were hashing server side anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:07:37
Or go through a mixer.

@_date: 2014-02-25 14:51:44
Very good point, but couldn't you simply hash again on the server to negate this?
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:10:20
Easier to carry out transactions with. Don't have to wait for a confirmation.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:33:47

@_date: 2014-01-15 12:02:56
Yep, but if you want to pull the money from that stealth address to one of your storage addresses that'll all be transparent on the blockchain, right?
Suppose you could do a second stealth transfer to yourself and then the original sender won't be able to keep track.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:30:02
The thing is, with a lower confirmation time, the less value there is in the work, so it doesn't really help much.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:13:30
A lot of smaller inputs is better for servicing things like withdraws. 
It means you don't have to have a larger proportion of your total coins as unconfirmed balance when doing a transaction with an input if the input is close to the desired output.
That's why there is a 60/40 split too, so there is more variance across the different inputs under MtGox control for better efficiency in withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:38:23
There are restrictions on the amount of fractional lending commercial banks can leverage. This is dictated by the FED AFAIK, and I think the current ratio is 1:7.

When I say 'hash' I'm implying a salted hash. To generate this set of pre-fabricated hashes they would have to create rainbow tables based on the salting occurring client side; this is still better than them simply bruteforcing with plaintext passwords.

Yes I'm aware that it doesn't add any protection in terms of MITM, and that hashing server side deals with that. I'm talking about protecting you from the (albeit much less important attack vector) server operator. If no hashing occurs on the client then you can't guarantee that your plaintext password isn't stored somewhere on the server, be it in logfiles or a database.
Most people use the same password, or similar passwords, for their logins across different sites. Client side hashing protects them from this somewhat.

@_date: 2014-02-25 14:08:49
Although you are correct, I think the concern here is that passwords were being sent to the server in plaintext, when the preferred procedure is to hash them client side and then to send them; this way the server doesn't see your plaintext password at all.
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:41:52
First, consider: What gives money value?
It isn't backed by gold like many believe, it hasn't been for decades. It has no physical properties other than the paper on which it is written.
Money has value because people agree to use it as a medium of exchange. People agree to trade their labour for it with the understanding that they can use it to buy the things they need. 
Money is a representation of value in a economy. Within an economy there is a certain amount of money and there is a certain amount of value; the more units of money that exist in an economy the less relative value each unit represents. This is the cause of inflation - units of money having less value means you need more to buy that carton of milk. Printing money creates inflation.
Bitcoin's value is completely unknown, and its value is being driven by market speculation; supply &amp; demand. The more people that believe in its ability to function as money in an economy, the higher the demand resulting in more people trying to buy in. A lot of people trying to buy bitcoin means they have to compete to buy before their competition - driving up prices. This is further increased by the understanding that there is a hard limit to the total supply of bitcoins, meaning that if a buyer believes that the utility and demand of bitcoin will continue to increase, and that the supply is fixed, the prices will keep rising - which makes bitcoin a deflationary currency.
The more utility the market thinks it has, the more value each bitcoin has. The volatility is a symptom of the uncertainty in the market, because nobody knows where it is going to go, i.e. is demand going to grow or are governments going to kill it? Is there a hidden catastrophic flaw in the algorithm that completely destroys it's utility as money? This process is called price discovery, and it is pretty much never ending.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:34:47

Got it from the wiki, but it is due to the cheksum at the end of end of a bitcoin address. The chance of a mistyped character still resulting in the same starting characters on the complete checksum which are appended to the end of an address is extremely unlikely, so without calculating it personally, I'm still confident in those numbers.

'New bitcoin' suggests an independent currency, which isn't desired at all. All your examples were *new* currencies and not a simple redefinition of the common unit.
I think changing the standard is a mistake. BTC should always equal the application level unit of 1 bitcoin. We shouldn't be standardising intermediate units when we have satoshis anyway.

I know exactly what a rainbow table is.
Onefingerattack suggested that it would be easier to send a bunch of pre-fabricated hashes to a server than sending a bunch of plaintext passwords, which is clearly not true.
I don't think you understand what I am suggesting anyway. The client hashes the plaintext, lets say;
sha512( salt +  plaintextpassword + pepper).
Lets say that gives us 
We transmit that to the server as our password parameter. Now the server has no idea what our plaintext password was to generate that hash, unless they generate rainbow tables for that particular combination of salt &amp; pepper.
The server side is now no different, they also apply a salt and pepper as per normal, lets say that gives them the following;
Which is then stored in the database.
This protects users from a badly set up server (be it logging, malicious operators, or an attack) from getting your plaintext password at all, which means most users who use the same password across multiple site (which is a reality) aren't going to become a victim of stolen passwords.

It's close in that namecoin is better suited for data storage, however key value pairs wouldn't necessarily be ideally suited to contracts.

SegWit acts as a bandwidth multiplier on base block size. 1MB limit with SegWit = same (or slightly more) bandwidth usage as 2MB.
2MB and SegWit uses a lot more bandwidth than just 2MB.
Chinese miners have stated that they can handle 2MB level bandwidth; not both.

all they have support for is the 2MB hard fork. Changes thereafter will have to be made with an approved process. It isn't like everything they do after their 2MB release is going to be accepted and auto downloaded without scrutiny. It really isn't a problem that the process to be used after the 2MB HF isn't known yet. it isn't relevant at the moment..
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:18:43
The reason they don't is that upping to 2MB *with* SegWit will increase bandwidth to a level they do not believe China's GFW can handle.

Just a different perspective; I work as a software engineer, and the technology behind bitcoin is absolutely mind blowing. It is extremely complex and grasping the entire ecosystem of the currency isn't exactly easy and that's coming from a computer science graduate. 
I had to do a lot of reading before getting a good understanding of how it all works. Bitcoin makes everyone feel like a dumbass at first.
To answer your main question; bitcoin is still in it's early stages. The most fundamental act; getting and storing bitcoin; is way too complicated at the moment for mass consumer adoption. Honestly, it doesn't have any use to you right now, but you should keep your eye on it because it is an incredible technology that *could* change the world. For example, if everyone used bitcoin, there would be no need for banks to hold anyones money and no need for any of the administration involved in transferring money.
Currently the most common use case for me is balancing books - my uncle and I often go to lunch, one of us pays the bill and the other effortlessly sends bitcoin to pay them back instantly. Once you are used to it, it is such a painless and effortless way to pay people - much better than dealing with change etc.

Yes, I'm still not seeing your point?
This hypothetical air gapped device purely outputs, it does not take any data input from any online device (in the real world it would need to scan QR codes too, but that's not the point). With this model the service that broadcasts your transaction does not have your private keys. Sure, it's still technically 'online' but only in a pedantic sense, for the purposes of users without access to the internet, it's offline - i.e. off the internet.
@_date: 2015-11-13 11:18:47
The problem is - who owns the private keys? Obviously boom.cash do. It's still not an offline solution.
A better product would be something more like a trezor. Offline creation of wallet, offline signing of transactions then a user gets the raw transaction and texts it to an sms service that broadcasts the transaction.
Is there a standard compression or QR display of a raw transaction? Would be pretty good if there was a way of signing offline, transferring via QR then sending via an app to any service that can take the raw transaction and broadcast it to the network. Could broadcast via radio, sms or fucking morsecode then, depending on the service.
Alright, I think I've a new side project. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 16:01:34
It hasn't finished crashing yet.
@_date: 2015-11-13 11:48:02


Yes it is, you sign the transaction offline on a dedicated offline device, then provide the signed transaction to an online service via another device that is online, e.g. to some SMS provider who knows to forward a signed transaction to the bitcoin network.
This way, the cryptographic work is completely air gapped, the only output is the signed transaction which can be safely displayed and given out.
The original problem is giving access to the bitcoin network to those without internet access. While boom.cash would do this, it doesn't in a secure manner.

and it would expose the cold storage paper wallet private keys to the wild (the computer that would sign the messages), which defeats the purpose somewhat.

@_date: 2015-11-03 16:45:07
So, there's this technology/concept called asymmetric cryptography. Essentially you have two large numbers that are mathematically linked, and you can use one number to prove you know about the other number, without giving away what that first number is. (This won't make any sense yet, but roll with it)
This is how bitcoin works. A bitcoin wallet is made up of a public 'key' and a private 'key'. These are just two numbers that are linked together in a provable way. The public key acts as your wallet address^\* where people send you money, and the private key allows you to move money that has been sent to that public key. This is a convention based upon the maths linking the two numbers. This works because both keys are intrinsically linked.
A *private key* is basically a tool that lets you interact with the network directly and say to everyone;


When you have that ability you can unequivocally tell the entire network that you authorise the movement of bitcoin from the wallet the private key is linked to, to another address.
The decentralized ledger of the bitcoin network takes note of this movement and knows what everyone's new balance is after that transaction.
An exchange works very differently. Your balance on an exchange is not represented anywhere on the blockchain. You have no way of telling the network that you own some of those bitcoins that coinbase holds. You have to rely on coinbase to let you access your bitcoins. Essentially you are making them your bitcoin bank.

Also shown here: 
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:22:03
By creating a proper bitcoin wallet and sending your bitcoin from an exchange to your own wallet. The private key associated to your own wallet is what authorises bitcoin to be transferred out of your wallet. If you own that, you own the coins on the public ledger.
On an exchange you rely on their bookkeeping to agree with your claim to ownership of some bitcoins they hold in their wallets. You then have to rely on their solvency, infrastructure and customer service to be able to move them.
On the blockchain you rely solely on your own ability to keep your wallet safe.

It's just an astounding amount of ignorance compressed into a short paragraph. I almost registered just to tell her she's an idiot.
But I'll just vent here instead.
1. 'Unsafe'
It's hard to know what you mean by unsafe. If you really mean 'hard to use without shooting yourself in the foot' then sure you might have a point. If you actually think it's unsafe' as in insecure then I don't know what to tell you. You should consider reading a bit more than headlines, bitcoin is an extremely secure mechanism of exchange, it hasn't been hacked since leaving infancy. Hacking the protocol is highly incentivised due to the nature of the network and it hasn't happened. It's as secure as any other  technology based on asymmetric cryptography.. like, say, SSL...
2. 'Hacker's paradise'
This is a logical fallacy. Sure, hackers use it due to it's superiority in many ways. Cash is a criminals paradise, does that mean you shouldn't use cash in your day-to-day activities too?
3. 'Regulation &amp; Protection'
It would be an optional feature, those interested in bitcoin like it precisely due to it's lack of regulation and state 'protections'. There isn't 'no' regulation, in fact the regulations are probably the real reason Upwork hasn't implemented it. KYC requirements for withdrawing bitcoin would be a real logistical &amp; legal challenge for Upwork. Those who know what they are doing are definitely a lot MORE protected with bitcoin than they are with bank accounts anyway.
4. The Founder is the only one who is secure
How does this even make any sense? It's true that the individual, or group of individuals, who acted under the name Satoshi Nakamoto have a lot of bitcoin. Tell me, how can they extract the value out of those bitcoins via a bitcoin exchange if they magically destroy bitcoin? Do you understand market forces?
5. Ponzi cash collecting
By what mechanism are 'minions' collecting real cash? Do you mean by selling bitcoins for cash? Well, again, it's the market determining value.
6. Cut and run
This really just shows that you don't know what you are talking about. It's great how you can go from your first sentence claiming perfect understanding to ending on a complete impossibility. Lets say Satoshi 'cuts and runs'. By selling his coins? As soon as the network sees those coins move, the price will start to drop. He can't get his coins out in a timely fashion without losing their value almost entirely. He can't cut and run and make any money. Even if he did make that irrational decision, the protocol and network are completely decentralised and out of Satoshi's control. It would continue until the network reaches a consensus on ending the project.
But, most importantly, do you know that Satoshi has already ran away and left the project? He is no longer involved in development in any shape or form and has not been heard from in years. Satoshi's coins are still in the wallets they started in.

Huh, update hasn't hit my appstore yet. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:24:04
There's a second screenshot in that link showing the numbers and the bar graph.
7 and 9 are beside eachother but 8 is on the complete other side of the dice. They are 0-9 A-F, but on the screen for entering rolls I was shown 0-9 A-F even without that setting enabled, but the stats screen did show 1-16.

Rather than discounting bitcoin you should consider adding a premium to other payment methods.
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:45:13
There's a few tools out there, but I'm not sure which one I'm going to use yet. Google for 'bitcoin private key to public key utility' and you'll see a few.
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:34:07
You might want to cancel that order!
I tested 320 rolls using android app and they are collectively 0% fair apparently.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:51:30
I'd consider them burned as burned as I consider satoshi's original coins.
No way real satoshi would compromise his identity like that.
@_date: 2015-02-20 10:27:14
No he didn't.
His account was hacked.

The underlying ECDSA private key is just a binary representation of a large number, in this case I'm representing it with 64 (Rolling 16 dice 4 times) hexidecimal characters.
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:41:20
You joke, but the first roll did have a lot of paired characters. Going to trust that is more me seeing patterns though.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:34:38
Have you got the .apk? Would rather install via adb than get amazon appstore.
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:39:38
Are you talking about the address checksum?
The address is derived from the public key, which is derived from the private key. You can create private keys in anyway way you want.
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:27:50
I did 320 rolls, 0% fair! Jesus! Won't be using these for anything other than fun then by the looks!
Will do a better test later where I roll hard.
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:55:25
Sure, be sure to deposit hundreds of bitcoins in it too, yeah? Promise I won't steal them.
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:53:50
Nope, saw it on 4chan this morning
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:13:24
The cool things you've been hearing about, like multi-signature wallet transactions, are more likely to be relayed by nodes and included in blocks.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:54:27
It figures it out. If you stick 64 characters in that wallet details input that are all in the range of 0-9 and A-F then it'll do the rest.
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:45:37
Here's some screens: 
I didn't change that setting, what effect would that have?
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:13:53
Not that I know off, I paid fiat for them.
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:15:16


Sure, which requires a computer. Deriving the public key from the private key uses a lot of complicated math that would take a really long time to do by hand.
@_date: 2015-02-24 11:35:22
Don't agree with their usage of bits though.. really don't think using bits makes it easier. I personally find it a lot harder to value.
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:25:46
The Eurozone just announced a 1.1 trillion EUR QE over three years.. so..

They'd have to know the order they fell in too!
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:45:34
In which case, why trust it to convert a given private key? That's an easier step to compromise.
Ninja edit: Unless you mean in terms of the rng not being compromised but not working correctly; which is a good point.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:54:07
I would have thought that the set of people into bitcoin would have largely been in the set of people who are technically minded enough to use a screen recorder. Jesus.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:25:16
That looks pretty good.
Out of interest, why are you importing stuff inside a function? So if that function isn't used then it won't waste memory?
@_date: 2015-02-25 00:15:58
by a really strong margin too..
@_date: 2015-02-05 10:04:36
Yeah, because bitcoin won't be fractionaly reserved if it becomes the defacto currency.... /s

Hate when sites hijack my scrolling like that. Just don't do it - I'm used to the way my touchpad scrolling works on *every single other site*. 
'Smooth scrolling' can suck my dick.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:23:36
That's awesome, definitely going to give this a go.
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:36:21
Roll four times and you have a bitcoin private key in hex. Getting the public key from that private key will require a computer though.
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:58:00
Dunno, I'm probably going to check on it from time to time and throw a few bits to keep it over the line.
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:48:25
In theory yes, but in reality somebody could roll for the rest of their life and they would never get the same as anybody else. Assuming the dice are fair..
@_date: 2015-02-19 11:29:46
You need the older blocks first to confirm the chain
@_date: 2015-02-09 10:35:51
Just to clear this up for you:
This private key is the 'foundation' of a wallet. The public key is derived from the private key, and the private key is what is used to digitally sign transactions so the network knows the transaction is real.
You can import private keys on many webwallets, exchanges and personal wallets. Once you import a private key you can 'sweep' the balance into your own wallet, or you can just keep it as is.

I suspect he was being serious.
'The Shock Doctrine' is a popular book and documentary based around slamming Friedman's neoliberalism, and it spends a long time looking at Chile.

Jeez bud you need to do some reading on economics
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:34:22
Thing is, converting that private key to a public key *needs* a computer; which means entering your private key into a program. Kinda defeats the point. 
If you are going to use an air gapped computer to convert your private key to a usable public key then you may as well use the same air gapped computer to generate the private key in the first place.
@_date: 2015-02-16 11:14:53
I'd add,
**In eurozone:** [Kraken](
SEPA payments etc work great with kraken.

Are you using a third party DNS? I wonder how they are blocking it, it might just be with their DNS.

If bitcoin doesn't have a stable future then it has no future. I'll accept the volatility now, but if it is still volatile after mainstream adoption I would be shocked.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:07:00
I thought RllCKY's comment was @_date: 2013-12-18 10:47:00
If hoarders start selling it will greatly benefit bitcoin in the long run anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:50:36
You had me there. Hungover brain is fail brain.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:29:38
Cool idea! Might give this a go!
