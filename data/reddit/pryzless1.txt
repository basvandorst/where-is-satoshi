The main issue is a logistics issue. Even if they used dollars they still couldn't buy meat today. Their is no supply, no market, no vendirs to get the needed supplies regardless of currency.

Hodl started as a meme. It's a conspiracy now pushed down our throats by whales trying to rid themselves of their crypto for cash while we keep the prices from dropping too much. 
If you see Hodl everywhere u look u better sell and run away

Its about to be 4,500 and he still will be saying suckers for not buying. There are huge issues with Bitcoin and Eth that are foundational problems which can't be fixed. Hitting 2k watch.

Probably put $2,000 in when the price was at 1,000. Then 20k when it hit 9k then everything above the 15k mark. Perfect example of a bag holder. Denys being wrong and making a mistake because he literally can't. If he is wrong he has to accept the fact he just reset his entire lifes income to about 30-40k, stole his kids education, and is actually a homeless loser instead of the brilliant, I was right look at me know guy he thinks he is.

Right most people would sell at a profit of 20 bucks just so they could buy the dip. Even if he had balls of steel selling at 5x profit is very unlikely. The only ones that became millionairs are the ones that bought and forgot until it was on the mews and they sold at 1000x profits.

The bottom of 3k or less looks a lot closer now than four days ago
