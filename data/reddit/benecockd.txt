I was there when it was created on 4chan, apparently it's a 4 step process, 1.) create blockchain 2. Name it dogecoin and people will value it in the future, 3) ?????? 4) profit!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:35:11
invest in the GBTC stock or whatever... you don';t even need bitcoin and all gains are tax free!
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:54:16
fuck, i should've waited 5 seconds
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:40:24
i would assume the same thing, but not everyone is 100% in bitcoin, and this is a legit option for some people... just throwing it out there... 
@_date: 2018-08-07 14:27:13

is there a discord for this subreddit?
@_date: 2018-06-22 11:57:17
hey mates, my friend and i were having a discussion about Lightning Network and were wondering, how does a transaction choose a path to its target? Like if i want to send 20 bucks to a seller, and there is a path with only 3 connections, and another with 6... how does it decide? Are fees a factor or does it all work together? 
I'm also inclined to believe this is an IOU on the blockchain for miners? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:06:41
your off by +$200
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:12:56

I love you too
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:17:30
i was there on 4chan when it was made... literally based on that people will give it value in the future...
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:56:32

if i use the electrum bitcoin wallet, will i be able to collect forked coins?
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:17:41
i mean, if you find 100k bitcoins, and it only worth 50,000 grand (per btc), wouldn't it be better if it was worth 100 grand (per btc)?
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:28:48
that's very true, they don't have to keep them. But why would they have inside info its worth less? I mean, i believe the governments have inside information, but not necessarily meaning its worth less... unless they can make it worth less, which they can...i guess, they would do that after they cash out...fuck
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:10:32
don't forget 2019 and 2021

doesn't JP Morgan have an ETF fund for Bitcoin that is regulated?
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:42:34
would that be around 55-65k USD per BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:43:54
honestly, if quantum computing came out, i would assume they would crack all the lost wallets, and whoever cracks them (goverments usually will get to it first since they have the technology), will get a shit ton of bitcoin and will only want to value them higher... i would expect this to actually raise the value, or whoever cracks those original wallets, they will want to drive the price up
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:53:22
there are commercials even on Amazon for season 1 and 2, where they show E-Coin, and i'm not sure if its the show or a commercial...
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:40:52
i mean, want to sell my forked coins for bitcoin...why wouldn't i take steps to increase my stack for free?
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:59:42
on changetip, would converting USD to BTC be good? Is the exchange rate on websites as static as stock itself?
