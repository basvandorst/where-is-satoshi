That's the reason bitcoin took off is because of illegal activities. You must be a noob here
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:44

The whole reason of bitcoin is so you can avoid taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:08:27
oh okay that may be why. You do need to have a credit card linked also.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:51:17
I did keep it on NiceHash due to lower fees. The cashout limit was around $120. My point is the majority of people didn't use NiceHash as their main wallet so it's not as bad a Mt Gox.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:04
Which happened with a lot of people that sold at the magic 10K. Then we're hoping for a dip and now were past 18 lol 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:16:32
Not really. I was one of them. The payout limit is $120 so the majority of people lost less than that including me. It's not like mt gox where people were losing life changing amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:12:56
121K next year 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:48:39

Spending money on BTC wasn't a dumb idea. But blowing it all on a trip along with your personal belongings is. I'm older so I know some older people who aren't doing well and really regret spending all their savings on travel. Some of them literally toured the world in their 20's. Just a heads up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:36:56

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:31:20
So the same as me. I have nothing in my 401K. Not impressive without figures.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:33:27
I don't care what he buys I only think it's a bad idea because he was putting all his savings into it. He msg me already and said it was just his profits so it's all good.

@_date: 2017-11-29 23:23:18
If it keeps the current growth then it will be $121K in 2018 and over 1M in 2019. So this guy is being pretty conservative giving himself an extra year padding

@_date: 2017-11-05 22:10:29
I'm dead serious. If you use the percentage growth from the last year it will hit 1M in 2-3 years. (Obviously I don't believe it will keep these crazy growths but math doesn't lie).
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:19:54

It's tough to panick when you bought most of your coins at 5K. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:13:31
You're an idiot if you think thats not trading. Not everyone does it down to the minute. I sold my btc at 8k and bought again a few days later when it dipped down to 5k. I was always going to buy back and that's what smart people do. You're not smart which is obvious since even people on front page now realized it's fake. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:18:08
It's NOT the same. If you really want another example then let's say you owned Action comics  and you sold it for $10. Now it's worth millions. Stil not as bad as bitcoin as that took like 50 years to go up in value compared to 5 years for bitcoin. I just discovered bitcoin this year so there's nothing to eat me up. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:35:41

You can use a PO Box if you're paranoid 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:49:22
If people put any $ in bitcoin that you actually need then they're a fool. Only invest what you can afford to lose. This makes it very easy to hodl through dips as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:04:55
I did over the ~$100 limit so I got an extra $10 which covered the fee and then some. Signed up a few days ago.

Thanks for doing the math. I was too lazy so just did rough estimate in my head 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:29:13
I'm guessing you also wasted coins since it sounds like you're trying to make yourself feel better. The guy could've been a millionaire today if he didn't spend the coins. No luck there. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:43:13
Why not both?  
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:31:11
Or just invest spending $. I have nothing to lose cause I would've bought games clothing etc instead. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:59:54
Your Fake post has no verification or proof in it (I just double checked). You would've posted it already if you were'nt FUD. Nice try though ;P

then will all have to go live on the moon ;D
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:54:26
I buy pretty frequently so I just leave them there for now. To lazy to transfer right now as I just put throwaway $ into it. If I lost it tomorrow it wouldn't bother me. Once it gets to a large enough amount I might invest in a trezor etc 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:06:33
He won't do it obviously. Going to make another account. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:21:05
Basically any dip that's still over what you bought it for is easy to ride through 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:36:26
I hope it goes down some more. I can't wait to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:38:10
I know. It's easy to double when you're worth less than a pair of socks lol let's see how fast bitcoin doubles when it's worth $200K

@_date: 2017-11-28 13:06:50
50k? I've seen larger amounts sold. It's called day trading noob. I guess you haven't noticed the large buys either shortly after. People who are smart always buy back in. 3 posts on the front page today that all say "I'm out". That's just paid FUD by bcash to convince people to sell. Only an idiot would drop their coins now 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:28:10

The hero we need!
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:39:44
I have so little invested I don't even check the price 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:47:10
I said that at the end of my post. This is to put last years growth in perspective. If someone said on Nov. 26 2016 next year on Nov 26 2017 bitcoin would be $9K everyone would think they were insane. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:15:23
Lmao youre funny. "Please believe me" 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:44:31
You mean like the housing market bubble experts have been saying would happen when I bought my house 12 years ago. Still waiting for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:15:57
In canada it's only instant 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:17:19
You're late 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:09:09
I just don't understand why anyone would take the chance even if it's under 0.1%. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:19:50
Millions lol my dad has billions.
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:41:15
News flash if you're getting robbed the guys have guns in their hands not 25 ft away from them 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:07:00
Your comment has nothing to do with my post lol what are you talking about 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:18:58
I could post a screenshot though. Too easy to photoshop the numbers 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:24:59
I'll hodl OPs mom 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:18:28
But I'm willing to lose everything 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:19:15
I just bought at 5K a few weeks ago for first time so I'm still a noob. Haven't sold a single Satoshi yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:03:14
No one asked you lol 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:39:41
I'd have to believe it in order to be envious. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:37:00
It's not a safe investment. I only put enough that if I lose it I won't even care. That's how it should be. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:52:37
That car heading outta town:
When bae says she's pregnant 
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:32:52
I wonder what that feels like. I bought my first at 5k and so far it's never gone down.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:40:10
I didn't see it come back that low. I just saw it when it hit 10K (again) and realized it went down to 6 lol 
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:32:03
Some serious losers in this thread. I check the price once a month when I'm buying more.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:54:44
8 years ago bitcoin was dead lol it just surged this year. And why come back in few months? Come back in 5 years. I will XD
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:14:08
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:07:38
Until OP wakes up and realized I hacked into his wallet :D
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:53:25
I'll buy tommorow 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:44:52
No but 23 is too old to be asking stupid questions! :p
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:29:55
Doesn't taking a screenshot of your password make having an offline wallet useless lol
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:57:54
People said there's a housing bubble in Canada. That was 10 years ago. Of course they're still saying it's a bubble lmao meanwhile an average single home is over 400K where I am and rising every month 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:25:45
Of course I didn't. I said I bought 1 bitcoin lol 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:55:56
I agree. You would actually believe someone put $6K into bitcoin their first transaction lmao 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:12:48
10 more years and it's the salary of a Sanitation Engineer in Africa 
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:42:11
If bitcoin dies 5 years down the road I can't wait to come back to this sub for laughs 
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:25:30
The cassette was invented over 60 years ago and then afterwards portable cassette players than cd', microdiscs, mp3, ipod. You just proved my point on how long it takes for something to catch on mainstream.
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:25:34
Dumbest thing I've read all day. "Nobody can know everything right guise!"
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:32:35
I just recently got my first bitcoin. Haven't looked at it since. It's better to just forget about it. If it does up in 5 years it'll be awesome if it goes to 0 it's all good. Should never invest $ in bitcoin unless you can afford to lose it. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:14:45
That's a very generous estimate. VERY. I don't think you realize how dumb the masses are.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:12:24
Fake post is fake 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:42:04
Lmao ^ What a fool. "This isn't it" Who comes onto a monopoly meme and gets mad when there's no real discussion. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:38:19
How can something be dead If it doesn't exist. Obviously it was created then and it was dead. I would even argue it's dead still compared to other currencies. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:47:27
Even if this doesn't pass it's only a mater of time. Bitcoin is still very small. Soon as it has a noticeable effect on the big guys... RIP bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:53:17
Terrible terrible example. Motion can be calculated precisely while the equations in economics can never truly be calculated. That's why there are so many experts with varying opinions in economics.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:43:10
Not in our lifetime 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:24:11
Actually you're very dumb since you didn't pick up on the point. You don't have to be smart to know economics. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:40:03
Economics is a joke. I took it in uni and I already knew half of it before I started lol
