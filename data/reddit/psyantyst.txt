so where did you get that text from?

and which town is it?

Satoshi would know the Reddit community will not believe a user claiming to be him, so he would not bother to create a profile (16 days ago!). The obvious difference between Satoshi and you is that he is clever...
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:42:22
Of course. But this is a bitcoin subreddit, so it deemed more appropriate.
@_date: 2014-09-03 09:26:20
It's a great infographic indeed, but too technical for a 6-minute general talk on bitcoins. Bookmarked for future references!

Anyone noticed how Bitcoin Solution's example scenario of "trading short" is wrong?

You asked for recommendations, so here they are. I filled in the poll, but it could have been designed better. For example, use radio buttons instead of check boxes. In this way one will not be able to select both Yes and No, as he can now. I also don't see why one should type "yes" or "no" in a field, instead of selecting an answer and then having a field for additional information. Also, I would make the poll more adaptive - if you answer "no" to "have you ever donated?", then a lot of the questions thereafter are useless. 
Hope you gather statistically significant sample!

good point!

Thanks for the tip. Compiling stuff from source is safer, but I agree with you that they also need to provide signed binaries. 
Anyway, I heard I can also use Cygwin and git to compile the source, but i'm not sure how. Any help will be highly appreciated!

No probs. We are holding Bitcoin meetups every 2-3 weeks. So next time you come, check out the Barcelona Bitcoin Community meetup group ;)

now store your private keys and BIP38 passwords [in an image](

You are right that 6 minutes is nothing. It's mainly about planting a seed of curiosity in the brains of people who never knew the concept of bitcoin before. That's my angle.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:55:09
just wait until those investors decide to cash in... 
@_date: 2014-06-19 07:34:38
So in which city is this?

I'm an "early adopter" of cloudhashing services and I must say I don't find them worth it. I purchased an infinite contract (which turned out to not be actually infinite) with an initially expected ROI of 3 months. 1 year later, I have only 60% return. although their customer support is good, in short I can say: I lost money with cloudhashing. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 18:14:34
It's Azarius. They not only accept Bitcoin, but also: Litecoin, Peercoin, Worldcoin, Dogecoin, Novacoin, Primecoin, Feathercoin, Namecoin and Terracoin. Coin party wooohooo!
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:01:57
Unfortunately that's true... But note that:
* one year ago there were very few companies who were not a scam (scam=100% loss). With cloudhashing I only got 20% loss, in part due to my naivety and in part due to their unfulfilled promises.
* "send us money and we will give you more money back" is exactly what banks are doing with saving accounts. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 13:01:53
even if not scam (unlikely), Ethereum is known for not honoring expected dates. The initial ether pre-sale was expected to start February and not end of July. So obtaining the ether you pre-order now will most certainly be delayed beyond "winter 2014/2015".

ok, here are the bad news: bitcoin.org is unreachable (repost:

your date format is not consistent. other than that, the extrapolation seems legit

Actually, this year the summer is less hot than expected. In any case, whenever you happen to be in town, we will be happy to see you on one of our regular Bitcoin meetups. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:14:09
meetup approaching - next week Friday 13.06.2014
@_date: 2014-06-14 10:15:55
Why would that be so? 
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:19:37
I call this censorship. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:07:38
To me this all sounds like: "I'm Satoshi, yes, I'm the real 'toshi, all you other Satoshis are just imitating. So will the real Satoshi please stand up!" We're gonna have a problem here..
@_date: 2014-07-30 07:06:55
We hold our meetups only in cooperatives, co-working spaces, or bitcoiners' homes. Our audience ranges from entrepreneurs all the way to rebels and revolutionaries. :)
@_date: 2014-09-03 09:18:08
All great suggestions so far. But I'm sure you are aware that Bitcoin is so much more than currency and money. OK, this suggestion is now banned: "Bitcoin: so much more than currency and money"
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:37:10
Good points to consider! The video - not so much. Though, if I remove all the "umm"s, it will fit in 6 minutes. BTW, his statement that "money has never been backed by anything" is clearly wrong, while "bitcoin is incredibly superior to gold" is debatable at best. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:39:29
unfortunately none of those show correlations with Bitcoin. Hence my post.
@_date: 2016-11-02 21:00:19
Couldn't agree more! Check out the slogan of our logo and you'll understand: "TicrThing: feed your crypto obsession"
@_date: 2016-11-02 20:58:10
Thanks for pointing out. These are all planned upgrades. Check out the "Stretch goals" in [our campaign](

The key word here is convenience, not improvement. OCD people need convenience too.

You can now go one step further and get a dedicated hardware price ticker, so you don't even have to grab your phone. We call it the [TicrThing]( and we made it especially for junkies like you (and us). &lt;end of product placement&gt; 
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:23:14
The comma moves to give way to the important digits first. So when the price exceeds $9999999, you can throw away the cube and enjoy  your billions :)

then a little moon symbol is displayed ;). jk

We have the intention to release the code + schematics, but no concrete plans yet. First we want to make everything top notch (and maybe return our initial investment) and then release it to the community.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:28:44
It's a hardware price ticker. It displays the price of crypto-currencies in national currencies (e.g. XBT/USD) or in other crypto-currencies (e.g. XMR/DOGE). See more info on our [webpage](
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:20:17
There is a whole [discussion]( on this, but we felt it is closer to ISO standards on currency codes, so we chose XBT. It is a recent change, though. The pictures you see on our [webpage]( are from the older version, which used BTC.
