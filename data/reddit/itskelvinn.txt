Ill buy your house for 3 dollars
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:16:07
I asked this on r/coinbase and a moderator said that its because when you click "buy", you are guaranteed that price for 30 seconds. The increase accounts for any changes within 30 seconds. 
Its all bullshit and it pisses me off because they sell to you for a higher price AND they charge you fees on it
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:34:06
I didnt hear about that effect taking place

Sucks that when a person openly admits that he/she was wrong, (difficult thing to do, and not common) other people tend to rub it in their face, like a bunch of children
Seeing reactions like this just make people less likely to admit that they were wrong. Whether it be crypto, science, politics, etc.
