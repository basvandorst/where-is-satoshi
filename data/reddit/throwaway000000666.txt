Thanks for the link, great post!
I think the LN devs will offer a guide how to set up a secure LN node. Security of the nodes is No 1 priority during the ongoing tests. 
Concerning spam, there could be rules for routing a tx, e.g. if my side of the channel would get depleted, the tx would cost n satoshi instead of being free.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:15:20
Why should I try to prevent spam? I'm puting no work into confirming transactions like a miner. It's pretty much free for me as well.

There could be rules for routing a tx, e.g. if my side of the channel would get depleted, the tx would cost n satoshi instead of being free.
Beside that in a future version you will have the possibility of rebalancing the channels on your node yourself, called 'splicing in / out' (without onchain tx).
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:20:48
My guess is that tx cost on LN will be zero at least in the bootstrapping phase. How do I know? Because I will offer routing (small) LN payments at zero cost as soon as mainnet LN is considered safe enough. And I do know about others who said they will help bootstrapping too (e.g. wumpus, lopp).
If we have a few of those highly connected hubs, everybody is able to open a channel with one or two of them, and pretty much reach any destination for zero cost or nearly zero cost. And those are just devs and enthusiasts, no banks and exchanges.

@_date: 2017-12-05 19:25:49
Correct. But why not release 0.15.2 with Segwit asap instead of waiting several more months for 0.16 where many other things have to go in as well?

Asuming they only want exposure to price, they can just simply roll into the next cash settled contract?
@_date: 2018-09-25 21:31:57
Looks like the CME bitcoin futures don't play a big role when looking at the volume compared to Bitcoin exchanges.
Why is Bakkt with their physical settled contracts a better solution for institutional investors than the cash settled CME contracts?
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:48:53
I've read often times that physical backed contracts are superior to cash settled ones. But I don't know if that's a fact or just hopium for hodlers (because backed ones need to actually buy Bitcoin).
Do Institutional Investors want exposure to Bitcoin or only exposure to the PRICE of Bitcoin? If they want it in their portfolio because of asset correlation reasons (and that's my guess), it wouldn't matter how the contract is settled (you can always roll cash settled ones into the next contract).
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:14:53
Routing is the missing keyword here. Funds aren't stuck in the channel if you can route them to other destinations as soon as the nodes open more channels...
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:55:09
The "addwitness" on cli in 0.15.1 is considered for testing. You can't get the change back to a Segwit address if you spend from one. And backups / downgrading won't work correctly if you used addwitness for existing addresses.
And I think many businesses use Core nodes and will wait for an official Segwit Core version before upgrading.
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:17:59
I'm in already, I even begged you to open a Channel with me (what you did; unfortunately LND closed it on us :P)

WEN ETF?
@_date: 2018-08-17 08:35:06
Yes, but only manually? So you yourself have to take care of channel state changes that might happen? And that means your backup is invalidated as soon as you send/receive/route a payment, probably minutes after your last backup.
Or what is your way of backing up channel states?
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:55:26
Is Tor already integrated?
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:39:57
Is this way of backup possible with routing nodes too?

144 blocks is the default, but you can set it yourself.
I don't think this is a problem at all, but I wanted to make clear that you'd get this problem first when your are offline before a pruned backend may become a problem...
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:21:58
But you already risk someone cheating you if your LND node is offline while some of your peers force closes a channel on you with an old channel state. And that's going to happen after 144 blocks afaik?
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:24:00
That's 8 month old info.
You can run LND with a pruned backend now (though it's not officially supported).

Neutrino comes with BIP 157 and BIP 158 to Bitcoin Core:
-  
- 
Those BIPs will be splitted in 3 PRs. The first one is already merged ( the second one is in review ( the third one is yet to come.
Hopefully it'll be included in Bitcoin Core 0.18.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:07:12
Correct. But channel timeout will be afaik something between 3-7 days. And it looks like we'll get mobile light clients (neutrino, eclair) right from the start. So even without a third party monitoring channels, unreachable states should not happen very often.

AMA request!
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:49:46
That seems wrong. Over 1,5 MB in the mempool, enough for a first big block:
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:42:06
I had to send two tx with Bitcoin Core 0.15rc2 today. Fee estimation was between 220-350 sat/Byte (I think that is with the new smart estimate fee algo). I changed it to custom fee and got both tx included in &lt; 6 blocks with fees of 16 sat/Byte and 21 sat/Byte (means estimate fee overpaying by more than 1000%). I did so by looking at the current fees in the mempool: 
It seems like we still have to chose the fee by hand.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:00:27
Depends on price. If BCH is around 0.1 BTC, hashrate won't be higher than those 10% of the BTC network.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:21:32
That desire makes no sense. You know that you are able to settle anytime if you want to. That's enough that you want your funded LN channels to stay open as long as possible to pay and get paid. Settlement is only needed in disagreement situations.
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:21:31
Fork Core 0.13.1 on Github. Increase blocksize and wait for miners, nodes and other ecosystem participants to adopt your fork. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:52:26
I fixed those (small) problems I had last year with the bitcoin payments woocommerce plugin.  If you are interested, PM me.
The advantage compared to BTCPay (or disadvantage, depends on your point of view) is, that you don't need a full node to connect to (it just uses a block explorer for verifying payments, so you're giving up some privacy here).

It's not my stream, so I don't know.

It's not; even if we'll have a hub and spoke topology at the beginning, the hubs (normally called nodes) can't do anything with the coins in the channels not belonging to them. It's trustless.
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:46:42
There is no privacy concern. If you don't want to have some node on your tx route, you can route around it.

Seems more like it was cancelled by only one CEO, Stephen Pair from Bitpay. His medium post reads like it was written before there was a decision made:
The update at the end of the text confirms this more or less. I think he told the other CEOs privately that Bitpay backs out of 2X and then they decide to cancel it.
If you look at the tweets from Jeff from yesterday, it seems like he was pretty clueless about the fact that they would call off the fork a few hours later, he was still in full Hardfork mode...
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:38:27
I said "in the beginning" wie might see a hub and spoke model. It's far easier to scale than p2p. And those nodes are only able to view the lightning tx from and to the next node. That means the nodes in between aren't able to identify the true sender and receiver of the transaction, and therefore aren't able to reject those tx based on some blacklist.
@_date: 2019-04-24 10:14:29
I'm stuck on "loading network"... isn't it possible to have two lnd instances on the same LAN?
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:37:41
But if Segwit activates on mainchain, we can have all the great stuff like Lightning on top of the mainchain, so there is no need to use the aux chain at all. I can even use my full node to only validate the mainchain (so no centralization).
If there are any disadvantages, please name them. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:40:31
Yep, so let the BU folks use the crappy aux chain for their onchain coffee, without degrading the security of the mainchain!

@_date: 2017-04-04 10:00:19
If segwit won't activate until the end of the year and no other proposal gets enough support, what is your **personal** opinion how we should move on? Segwit is my favorite as well as yours, but what is plan B, if segwit gets rejected?

"Last updated: 2 years ago"
"This plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download."
I think this was the only plugin that does not rely on a third party and can be used without a full node. Electrum can be used as a merchant wallet too, but seems more complicated.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:22:39
I am using it in production. But it is no longer maintained and lacks Segwit support. And I had to rewrite the parts where it connects to block explorers because it was outdated.

So... how does LedgerX manage a totally theoretical hardfork of Bitcoin? Let's say... November?
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:18:10
u/AaronVanWirdum please ask Arthur Hayes (Bitmex) on his stance on the 2x fork and how Bitmex will handle it:
"As for businesses and exchanges who did not sign the NYA, most are yet to comment.  However, some major exchanges and trading platforms, including BitMEX, have published standards about minimum technical safety requirements necessary for a hardfork coin to be supported.  As it stands, the SegWit2x proposal does not seem to meet all of these requirements, therefore many exchanges may be unable to even list the new coin, let alone support it as an upgrade to Bitcoin.  However, there may be time for SegWit2x to fix these issues before the hardfork date."

Good work from morcos, bit it's still overshooting way too much. Mempool is empty now, but fee estimate says 266 sat/Byte for 6 blocks confirmation target. I did a tx a few hours ago with 1 sat/Byte and it was included in the second block!

That's only the NYA "intention to signal" crap.
Take a look [here]( at BIP91 signalling.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:53:15
I like BTC.com, writing 'NYA' in coinbase text, but not signalling bit 4 :)
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:50:19
There is no need for anyone to adjust the code. Simply run Core, and you won't be on the side with the HF, because Core won't implement it (not in this short amount of time).

Fuck 5%! If the BU signalling miners had some balls, they would leave with all their 40% hashpower! But I guess deep inside their heart, they love Segwit very much! :)
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:24:31
When BIP91 locks in Segwit, shouldn't BIP148 Nodes help orphaning non-bit1-signalling blocks? That means you'd have to change the date from Aug 1st to whenever BIP91 starts orphaning (looks like Sunday).
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:03:59
Absolutely. There'll be huuuge sell walls on every exchange far below 0.1 BTC...
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:23:53
Is it correct that as soon as BIP91 starts dropping not-Bit1-signalling blocks, all miners have to change the version field to 0x20000012 instead of 0x20000010 (this is what Antpool is signalling right now)?
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:28:50
What do you think will be the value of the Bitcoin-ABC Coin after they forked off and BTC people dumped their ABC coins?
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:01:52
This price is impossible after the fork imho. You need buy orders to sell into, and I guess the sell side will be much bigger... 0.05 BTC at most
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:35:04
Yep, correct. Miners not running BIP91 risk building on non-segwit blocks (but I doubt we'll see one).
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:57:30
Miners only need to signal bit1. Signalling has to be 20000012 or 20000002. Other blocks will be orphaned starting on sunday.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:47:04
But BIP148 nodes won't start orphaning non-segwit-blocks before Aug 1st. BIP91 (Segwit2x nodes) will start earlier. It would strengthen the network if BIP148 nodes would start earlier as well.
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:09:43
If Core wants Segwit supporting Miners to continue using Core, they should merge [BIP91](
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:06:25
Maybe a patch that enforces bit1 signalling starting at block 477120 (like BIP91)... BIP148 is a bit late to the party
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:19:11
Why don't you merge this into Core, at least as opt-in? Miners like Bitfury could continue using Core instead if BTC1.

@_date: 2017-05-23 19:33:10
The bit 4 Segwit signaling is absolutely idiotic and just more work for everyone. Just activate Segwit via bit 1 (BIP9) and concentrate on the HF. That is more than enough work for 6 months.

@_date: 2019-05-10 09:41:08
If I remember correctly you are running lnd on a 1GB low-end box? No problems with low memory on your end? Even with v0.6.1 I have to restart lnd once a day because it keeps eating my ram. Here lnd starts off with &lt;200MB, next day it's &gt;500MB. It didn't got much better with v0.6 / v0.6.1... (I'm on  a raspiblitz if that's relevant)
