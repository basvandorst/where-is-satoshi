Really?, Because send a transaction for a few sats because are a few Bitcoin, it didn't pass but after 3 days got a message about double spending and got it back.

Buy high, sell low, profit. 
Reddit way.

Satoshi himself considered that anything below 0.01 btc is spam. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:11:32
He said that Bitcoin will be useful for high transaction, like 0.01 btc, never for pay for your coffee for pay for read. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:06:43
This is very stupid. 
- declare Bitcoin as a legal tender. 
- make exchange regulated by gov
- accept Bitcoin for petrol
- subsidized minning farms
- subsidized development of merchant software to work with Bitcoin. 
That's all Maduro needs to do, all or nothing, but no, instead they come with this stupid petrol crypto.

Stupid questions. 
To receive founds in a lighting wallet need to have founds?.
Who open the channels?, Who wanna support the network?.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:52:25
Bitcoin to the moon!!!
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:52:20
So Bitcoin is one of the biggest bubble in history, but effect in global economy is almost zero?.
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:56:43
So what about the futures?, Bitcoin is still alive?, Ready for moon?.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:13:00
Wow!!! Lighting is fast, really fast!!
So don't need to have Bitcoin to use a lighting wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:27:11
Yeap, and that can be mined at your home with and 5 years old computer. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:58:36
See you at the other side. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:15:26
I hope you are right. 
This year was stressful with Bitcoin going up and up every week. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:41:35
When Bitcoin what, no when you want. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:01:52
I'm using eclair test wallet, any site where can test lighting? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:26:01
Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments.  Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01.  The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:06:36
The fun part it's that's didn't try double spend. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:22:42
I'm testing eclair and lighting is fast, very fast. 
Any lighting hub to create a channel?

Can we just ban Asians from Bitcoin?, Really, prefer a stable sub10k Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:23:59
So Robin hood will allow people to buy high and sell low for free?, 
What a good name for an exchange.

Good for you. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:55:29
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:20:59
Of course, how do you expect to people criticize Bitcoin about having high fees if they pay cheap fees?.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:12:30
I'm just sad because don't have money to buy the dip. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:56:50
This is the end friends. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:33:38
And the dip is gone. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:39:00
the problem wasn't spend that Bitcoin in wow, the problem was not buying again. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:51:26

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:35:50
I be so happy if Bitcoin end the year at 10k/11k,  it means more time to buy for poor people like me. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:02:18
I'm not gonna contradict them. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:43:56
I love the dips!!!
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:51:32
Just buy, like the guy who buy ath at 2800 and tough was crazy, now is happy. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:57
At this rate 20k before New year. 
Happy and sad. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:53:10
aaaaaaaand 16k is gone...
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:57:07
Why not take a medium amount, put it until value increase X2 then cash out about 75% of your initial investment and mountly save small amounts?.
That sounds not so conservative but allow you to gain money in a relatively short time. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:52:25
Quite impressive the nivel of attack on Bitcoin while searching on Twitter. 
Just miss the part we're Bitcoin was developed by the devil. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:28:19
Imagine when a country demand Bitcoin to buy petrol!!!
God, that day will be a storm o money, not just a rain. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:41:13
How resistant are hardware wallet?, Can survive underwater?, If something bad like a car accident are tough enough?.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:55:26
Investing early means less money, more Bitcoin. 
So investing at 2.5k was a lot cheaper than now. 
Riskier but cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:31:02
Life is so unfair. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:16:53
I don't like it. 
I don't want that obscurity in a transparent system like money. 
Bitcoin represent the opposite of our current monetary system. Transparency, even if it hurts. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:53:32
I'm the dip guy, buy and Bitcoin goes down so I'm afraid of buying more. 
Maybe this time is different. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:55:17
You can give your Bitcoin for free if you dont want it more. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:20:31
Because we are talking about money, not about installing some Linux distribution to check what happen. 
That's why things took time,we are Bitcoin, not ethereum.

But that's not real dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:48:36
If you ask me, Bitcoin is just recovering from past mistakes and reaching they real value. 
After 8 years and still under 1k(early 2017) with 16 millions of Bitcoin mined that is the real price. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 00:31:04
with current inflation is too expensive to keep the price at 100k, that means 180.000.000usd to keep the price. After the next halving is just 90.000.000usd to keep the price.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:48:33
But why?, 10k is just a number?, Why not 9999?, Or 11k?

Is all about trust. Why futures didn't came with Bitcoin at 100usd?, Trust. 
An etf is a(nother) proof is trust from mainstream. 
And that means that a lot of people that think that Bitcoin is a bubble maybe reconsider their opinions because a bubble isn't backed by an etf. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 01:53:34
That's mean that the market have to spend 108.000.000 usd daily to keep that price. With the current inflation of course. 
Edit: with only 900btc per day means that the market need be able to buy 54.000.000 usd daily. 
Interesting how less inflation make easy or cheaper to keep the price. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 01:02:30
No, I don't. 
I'm more happy with Bitcoin at 7k, because is cheaper.

If you are an investor, then don't invest more than 5%.
If you are a believer, then patience and enjoy the ride. 
Talking for myself, I'm build my position for the next bull run.

If we sell then the dump is worse. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:06:39
how much did you buy?, was a debt?.
18k for now is gone, so let focus on 7/8k, if you buy at this price, when we reach 20k your gains will be around x3. So get some money and buy more, buy every dip-

because bitcoin until 2140 is designed to need more and more buyers to keep the price. Isnt like like gold that adapt to buyers or sellers or stocks that have a limited number.
If people stop buying, then price will drop until find a price that buyers can support.

Yes ,they can. The problem is that they own a lot of bcash. If they sell the price will dump more. 
If they forget about bcash and mine Bitcoin then price of bcash will dump and they are screwed up. 
They also need to sell a lot of s9, that in the current bear market nobody want. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 03:39:41
i hope not, my goal is 0.5btc by EOY, and with btc at 8k is easier than with btc at 10k or 20k.

This's just a good capitalism system sell as socialism.
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:00:19
This is very simple. 
Miners expect to sell Bitcoin at 8k, if no one buys, then the price will drop. And again. They will try to sell, and if no one buys again. The price will drop. 
So this year we don't have enough buyers to keep the price high. That's why always the price drop. 
And I can talk for my self. This year since March haven't buy any Bitcoin, because don't any money. No, I'm not the guy that is guilty of this bear year, but spend all my money last year in the bull run. 
And like me. A lot of guys did the same, so stop with theories, get some money and enjoy this cheap Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:28:16

Don't forget about the monetization of lightning, currently you can only make money by mining Bitcoin, but that is almost impossible. But with the LN you can build a node with high liquidity and make some money. 
That also means more full nodes securing the network.

no confirmation times, minimal fees.

What if this big buys keep the price above 6k?, Just like a small amount of BTC is sell daily.

I don't have enough Bitcoin to care about adoption. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 00:47:54

@_date: 2018-10-15 00:09:10

In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for [mining]nodes. I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.

at some point bitcoin will reach critic mass that will be very easy reach 50k and even 100k before 2020.

If the same amount of users keep buying daily then with 900btc per day the price should be 12k. 
And if you the keep the parameters for the next buble the next ath should be at 40k minimum.

how much before the 21mill limit is increased or changed?
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:10:58
Yes. 
Bitcoin was designed to be runned across thousand computers across the world. 
And we are running Bitcoin in a few pools. 
Bigger blocks means running a centralized system, and we already have banks to do that.

If this continues by the end of the next year 50k will be a reality. 
Just think. The bigger get Bitcoin. More coverture from the media. Easier for normal people to enter and trust Bitcoin. 
With more people comes more value and stability. 
At some point Bitcoin will become self conscious and it's gonna be to late to try stop him.

I just regret not buying 2 years ago. But being realistic probably I will'be lose my Bitcoin if I buy in 2010. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:14:21
infinite loop.
- The fees are high, 
- people dont make much transaction and just use bitcoin as store of value(like me). 
- So miners need to inflate fees to make some money from the few transaction 
- so less people does bitcoin transaction.
Repeat and repeat.
what if you lower your fees, yes, you will gain less from transactions, but much more people will be using bitcoin for transactions, so they make much money.
Bitcoin going to the moon means more people using bitcoins, just economy of scale, lower your fees, more transactions and the more money you make.
sadly miners dont think that way.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:17:55
yes!!! is cheap if you wanna send lot of money.
but if you wanna live out of the current economy system you cant pay your coffee with bitcoin. Or if the economy colapse and wanna use bitcoin to daily living you are doomed.

1800btc are mined daily. 
Looks like miners avoid to sell to keep the price hight. 
But they have to pay bills so they are forced to sell (gold bless pow).
So lots of Bitcoin on sell produce the dip. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:31:09
The first time was ugly, now is just another chance to buy more Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:52:29
But Bitcoin is free money!!
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:30:28
Can we get 5k Bitcoin this week?.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:17:27
Buy half, and wait. 
But this year looks like a bull year. So do t panic and wait, Bitcoin will fall again to 7k. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:34:48
Just buy a little more. Take your chances guys. 
Better to buy at 6.8k than 20k. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:14:18
Check the spread. In my exchange spread is huge, you sell really low while buy price is really high.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:01:34
BTC price: 10k
Sell price: 9.6k
Does it means that while the price is 10k to buy, when. You sell the price is 9.6k. you have to wait until price is below 9.6k to have profits. 
And what if Bitcoin bounce?, Like used to do. 
BTC Price 11k, but remember that you sell at 9.6k.
That's how do you lose money, and don't forget about the fees for selling and buying. And if you love en usa, taxes.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:22:45
I can answer for my self. 
Last year buy every day until have no more money. 
This year just second time buying and small amounts. 
Looks like buyers don't have money and normies aren't interested so the price will drop until it finds buyers. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:22:40
Also don't confuse, the bear market is over. Forget about 3k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:11:03

I was getting nervous.

Paynyms are great! Sadly only samurai wallet support it.

Since you own 51% of the network, what if the idea behind destroying your income??.
Is like apple destroying iOS.

But, but  Vlad zamfir says that we should be rule the future of the block chains...

Another way to "sell" is buy stuff at Amazon with pay with moon. When (if) Bitcoin goes down just buy what you spend.
@_date: 2019-02-27 15:26:11
Read. Currently there's no much money, but they are taking position for the next halving. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:56:41
If you buy at 3k, at 30k you got gains of 10x
If you buy at 10k, you have to wait until 100k to have 10x gains. 
Imo you in the middle, not too late, but not too early.

Bcash is going to be the first crypto taken down for a government. 
And when that happens. Bitcoin will soar to the stars.

@_date: 2019-02-24 01:02:35
Being able to use my BTC to buy an account at Satoshi games was really exciting!!
Selling my Bitcoin for some alt  that probably will die in less than 5 years is plain stupid.

finally a big treat for btc instead of roger ver or the impostor.
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:37:13
Thanks. 
also means that those satoshis are lost forever?.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:40:30
Start by demanding to exchange and everyone on Bitcoin world to use segwit. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:27:01
That's happens when you live in a dictatorship, poor Venezuelan people, ups, sorry. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 17:56:45
I will not accept your shitcoin for my hard work.

How much did you lose?, A lot. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:36:32
Hahaha. 
What an idiot, maybe wants to buy cheap BTC from weak hands.
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:47:18
Still remember when someone says something like this on Twitter "some people don't want to buy Bitcoin and make more rich early buyers, they prefer to start they own currency and buy new tokens".
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:26:17
Please bitcoin, need more money to buy more Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:26:17
You need to meet the guy who buy just before a dip. Both of you could be really good friends. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:53:03
Don't forget about parity. 
Yes. That happens when people want fancy things when their money. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 22:05:43
Demand segwit, and use exchanges and wallet that implement segwit. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:56:05
Have you tried again?.
@_date: 2019-02-27 21:02:27
@_date: 2019-02-19 16:47:28
What eclair really lack is being a good wallet for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:20:41
8.5k or 9k could be a good entry point.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:53:43
1) Bitcoin dip to 8k: too scared to buy, fearing a higher dip. 
2) Then Bitcoin rise to 9k: don't buy because is a dead cat bounce. 
3) Bitcoin to 10k: damn, why didn't buy at 8k
4) Bitcoin at 12k: because spend to much thinking Bitcoin rise again, decide to buy back at 13k
5) go to 1
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:31:57
Just buy some damn Bitcoin, what else you have to lose?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:42:10
In the future probably we have to increase block size, but not like an idiot just increasing because is easy and makes users happy. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:57:53
I'm scared ��
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:31:25
If miners and exchange don't use it's really matter?.
Segwit was delayed a lot of time, but still cry about high fees, now segwit is activated and started with the damn forks. 
But still the % of segwit is really low. 
You can start demanding segwit. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:09:40
Just before bcash fail. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:54:42
Bitcoin was born to survive!!!
If it can survive this idiot attack then we can't defeat the banks. 
Trust in Bitcoin people. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:21:18
No please, not yet. Need more time to buy more!!!
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:59:04
Roger ver: bitcoin is just a name, the highest coin can claim it. 
Also 'buy Bitcoin', what Bitcoin?, The coin with the highest value?.
He then lie to people by selling a coin without the highest value as the coin with the higher value. 
What a shitty person.
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:40:18
What about paynyms?, Can use 2 wallets to move my Bitcoin from one to another using paynyms?.
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:43:02
We need to create some kind of group to buy every Bitcoin domain and avoid situations like Bitcoin.com
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:45:43
Really?, What about the internet connection to download a blockchain that increase by 8mb every 10 minutes?.
Yes, only Chinese miners will have the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:52:52
Never bet against Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 23:27:05
Still visible this ad?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:40:59
Not only that. 
Does it mean that one day you will hear the rumor that maybe, just maybe Chinese government seized data centers holding the blockchain. 
That day bcash will die. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:49:37
So this is more about day trading than buy for long term?.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:05:02
Yes, even the dip were fun. 
But seriously, I'm tired if having swings in price Everytime a rumor come from.china. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 02:08:56
any way to use electrum with my own node?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:31:13
Good. Maybe a dip is coming. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 04:20:20
Ok. Now let's say that I'm using a custodial wallet, and the wallet lost all the info, all the satoshis are lost?.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:30:45
Hey big brother. 
Im gonna kill your or liberate you. 
But everything is gonna change. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:45:47
Please, stay away from Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:36:28
Why not use visa instead? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:53:27
We need the guy who buy Bitcoin and a dip occurs. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:44:17
Nice. That is needed in situations like this. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:01:10
Tell me.  Why was so hard to invest like, 10 dollars, if it works, fine. If it fails, fine. 
That's don't understand from people that follow bitcoin from 2010. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:13:49
Every day is like "what can destroy Bitcoin today?". 
Really guys, is very stressful. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:19:37
Yes. If minning bcash is more profitable than minning Bitcoin nothing to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:34:09
Trust in Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:54:23
We need some kind of bit666 for biometric wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:01:19
I don't like bcash but what can we do?, Nothing. 
That's why they say that must co-exist. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:03:30
Bitcoin and gold. 
That's all you need in a world where bubble are part of the market. 
@_date: 2019-02-17 15:35:15
If everything goes accord the plan, this year. But spect some delays because software development is hard.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:14:22
Now 6k is a support. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:56:49
So again Bitcoin is going to flop Everytime a news come from China?.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:10:03
Segwit ready?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:10:14
Again. 
We need to test segwit and see were it lead us. 
Once segwit if fully operational the devs will know what need to be done. 
Patience my friend. This is money. Or do you wanna end like ethereum with money looked. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 20:54:54
Patreon isn't the greatest thing. They just have a good idea, payed content behind a paywall.
But interface is shitty as hell, yes, monthly payment is great, but is what credit card allow, not patreon. 
And yes, recurrent payment is what lightning need in the future. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 03:43:56
It's just me, or this increase in lightning nodes, somehow secure an amount of transaction for miners?, This way one risk of Bitcoins, having just a few transactions that could lead miners to leave Bitcoin because the don't earn enough. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 13:55:33
Use Linux, ideally live distro. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:59:26
Do you remember when you don't know what to do with like thousand bitcoins?.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:29:21
If the other miners are planning on switching between btc and bcash you should buy more miners and screw those fockers. 
More slush and less Roger ver. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:03:04
Better than gamble. 
Bitcoin will buy my freedom. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:34:19
This is good. 
Yes. Now they have a toy called Bitcoin after they falied attempt to overtake Bitcoin. 
Now just wait, until bcash fail and Bitcoin devs prove that they were right. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:28:06
Never return scumbag.

@_date: 2017-11-14 00:00:10

Good?, Bad?, This is Bitcoin, censorship resistant. 
@_date: 2019-02-17 15:37:40
This. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:54:22
It's segwit enabled by default on Bitcoin-qt?

Put your money in Bitcoin and can live from the interest. 
Enjoy the deflation.

@_date: 2017-11-03 21:28:17
Have a few Bitcoin in my cellphone wallet, less than a dollar, but remember check a lots of wallet and find the most used and with less bad comments. 
Find myeliceum. 
Buy a new cellphone and imported using the seeds. 
No problems.

Bcash will be a place for experiment with radical ideas. 
Expect a quick and painful death. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:13:32
I would expect more dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:23:51
this is PoW!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:29:36

And here we are, there's no way for us to store our wealthy, not until Bitcoin of course.

how many of these nodes run on AWS o digitalocean?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:48:54
Miners join and leaving Bitcoin should be banned. 
Really. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:36:56
But witch Bitcoin?, Good one or the bad one?.
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:11:26
Ideally block size should increase every 4 years. Since the halving decrease the rewards, a size increase should help to keep the miners interested.
The problem?, Determine the right block size. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:22:50
I also believe that, the problem is when, and the answer probably is many, many years. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 19:11:08
Since there's no cap in lightning transactions, the more transactions that you process, the low you can charge and the more money you can do. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:32:17
Then if chine sell more than USA then chine can call himself USA?
Seems logic. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 05:50:03
Satoshi wallet must be the prettiest and easier to user wallet right now. Still blue wallet is a good lightning/Bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:33:15

Prepare for the worst. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:41:32
Currently, 6 mining institutions represent the hashing majority (nearly 60%) of the network. According to those who think consensus is achieved and secured through mining power alone, the entire security of the Bitcoin network rests with… 6 companies. IMO, such a system would be as arbitrary as the Federal Reserve, easily controlled, and could in no way be considered “decentralized.”
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:07:13
If Bitcoin was controlled by miners then we aren't different from dollar being controlled by the Fed. 
Good for us that this is Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:30:29
I will wait. 
Until Bitcoin become usable again. 
And don't worry for miners leaving Bitcoin, money follow money. 
New miners will come. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:22:49
Demand segwit adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:14:32
Certainly. 
The more the price increase, the more Bitcoin gain trust among normal users. 
Of course, the gains now are lower than before. But more certainly. 
I'veen talking to my sister about Bitcoin since April, and she tell me that some of their co-worker wanna invest in Bitcoin. 
Why now and not before?, Trust, confidence and certainly. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:17:21
Just tell everyone who is interested in Bitcoin that don't use those services. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:29:31

Without those damns forks 10k will be so close. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:28:43
Create and account, they give some words to backup,  needs some work but looks interesting. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:02:50
At 10k Bitcoin market cap will be about 200mil, right?.
Still fear a crash to about 6k or 7k if we reach 10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:50:42
Crazy isn't?, 6k being a support. Who could believe that in March. 
Now Bitcoin must hold until futures arrives. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:38:51
Thanks for nothing. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:48:06
Imo even with institutional money the inflation is too high. 
Don't forget that until the year 2140 Bitcoin is going to have pressure on the sell side. 
That's why I'm expecting more dip and rip in the coming days, that bounce between 8k and 15k. 
Ps: yes, that's some of fundamental analysis, so no triangles or TA.
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:44:36
And still a barely used network, imagine when 10% of world population is using eos(if).
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:13:51
Better chances to buy cheap Bitcoin. 
Centralization is bad guys. Still don't get it?.
Do you really think that banks are gonna let you kill them without using the more power weapon that they have. 
The government. 
But no problem. Time will reach us that lesson. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:34:08
See you in hell!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:38:06
another dip, another (small)buy.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:40:29
That's why I'm here. 
I'm here for the revolution, and stayed for the memes. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:46:57

I'm just a poor guy :(
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:28:58
A whole year of Bitcoin at the same price would be a good thing. I'm not a millionaire, I'm not an early adopter, last year Bitcoin just increase and increase in price every day. 
So yes, if Bitcoin stay around the 10k this year then is a good thing. 
Remember that 2020 is the next halving, we don't have too much time to get a good amount of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:01:08
Just bought a little more. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:16:05

I'm fine, at this price my goal is get at least 1 Bitcoin before the next halving. 
With Bitcoin at 20k that goal was just a dream, but now look feasible. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:25:35
Release early, release often. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:09:31
Last night have a nightmare about Bitcoin at 2k. 
But was a nightmare not because Bitcoin was at 2k, was because i didn't have money to buy the dip. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:35:05
I bought since 1k to 20k, sadly didn't buy too much at 1k :(

As someone below says. If everyone thinks that's we are at the bottom and start buying, then yes, we are at the bottom. Otherwise if people think that can fall more, then they stop buying and then the dip will occur. 
Imo is what TA sometime works, everyone see the same and do the same, like buy at some level or sell at some level. Self fulfilled prophecy.

According to internet a trillion is 1 followed by eighteen zeros, so if Bitcoin reach 1 trillion, what would be the value of a single Bitcoin?.
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:16:33
thats sad men, but...
if you have that amount of bitcoin you should use a cold storage, if i were you what have been done:
- 1 btc to my mom, in a paper wallet, mom, this is mine, vary valuable, never lose it.
- 2.5btc in a paper wallet that under my control.
- 2.x bitcoin in the exchange, if you wanna play with the DIP, of trading.
seriusly, that amount of money need to be protected, put in different places.
Thats what im going to do when have more bitcoin.

Here's Buffett's "Top 3 Mistakes to Avoid":
1. Trying to time the market. "People that think they can predict the short-term movement of the stock market — or listen to other people who talk about (timing the market) — they are making a big mistake," says Buffett.
2. Trying to mimic high-frequency traders. Buying stock in a good business and hanging on for the long term, he says, is a better strategy than flipping stocks like a short-order cook flips pancakes.
Third one removed.

The more I think about eth the more don't see how you can make money. 
They idea behind are really cool. But they are just a tool, if you wanna make money bet on a ico. 
Really. Still don't understand why ethereum with unlimited supply, when you really are a tools for runs services will make you gain money. 
After all Bitcoin is a truly currency, ethereum not.

PoS was delayed in eth because miners don't like it. 
In Satoshi head creation of big minning nodes was part of the plan.  
You can build an alternative monetary system and want it to be cheap. 
In the future minning hardware will consume less power, and sun power will be cheap. 
Even Bitcoin can help to develop better technology for solar power.

this is truly huge.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:06:39

500mill is another number to wait, remember that some says that before 500mill Bitcoin will become to cannibalize gold.

the best thing about buying the dip is that losses are minimal, but gains, oh god.
Buying ATH at 20k, need to reach 40k to double your money, but if you buy at 7k, the gains when bitcoin recover 20k will be about x3.

what if producing a coin is like 100usd, and you only sell 10% of the mined coins to make the price soar?, and then sell all your coins to have a dip?, and build cheap to start all over?.
Bitcoin high cost production is like a tax, force miners to sell their coins.
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:44:39
Yes. 
I prefer to buy at 7k than 15k. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:10:18
Sadly the best thing for Bitcoin was having users forced to buy Bitcoin. 
Just imagine that anyone can produce a Bitcoin at home, then the value would be so low now. 
But today miners area forced to sell thanks to electricity bills(tax) and users forced to buy to keep alive the market. 
While in ether you turn on you computer and produce money, sorry but money don't work that way.

just imagine a seed as money, a seed hard to collect, maybe even cost your life because just grow in a dangerous mountain. And also you have a seed that grow in any house, just take the seed and wait 1 month, voilà, money.
People will say "why use a money so dangerous, isnt better a money that can be produces in any house?, after all if just a few people produce that money isnt fair".
Just search how much cost to run a bitcoin mining operation, if ethereum guys think that their coin, produced in their garages can have a higher value than a coin that take millions to dollars to create are delusional.

yes, is related.
Because if anyone can produce a coin A, and just a few people can produce a coin B, because, you know, production cost.
then value of coin B always be higher than cost of coin A.

Because they believe that blockchain, not Bitcoin is the future. 
They believe that people always will trust banks and governments.

"The extrinsic (perceived) value of a specific stone is based not only on its size and craftsmanship, but also on its history. If many people—or no one at all—died when the specific stone was transported, or a famous sailor brought it in, the value of the rai stone increases by reason of its anecdotal heft."
i dont think that "life" will be part of the production of this kind of money /s

Yes. But crypto today is too small. Nvidia could be making billions with VGA for minning crypto. 
But they don't do it, why?, Avoid bad press and any kind of troubles. When Bitcoin become more mainstream than today, we will see big companies minning and the end of current centralization. 
Patience guys.

Worst?, Tried to mine like 2012 when heard about bitcoin, but forget because already was difficult. 
Then 2016 remember Bitcoin again, when was like 200usd, even gain some free Bitcoin on line. But didn't know where to buy forget again. 
And this year remember Bitcoin by accident, but know where to buy legally. But was unemployed so buy like 30 usd. Then like 50 usd next week. 
And the worst is all this year's wanting some way to gain money with no so much effort. Even tried gambling hahahaha. 
But today I'm investing heavy on Bitcoin, even think putting all my salary but still to risky if need the money. So invest like 1/5 of my salary in Bitcoin.

If you think about it. Gold isn't useful. 
You have to pay someone to keep your gold. And pay for it. And what if gold value increase like 1% and you have to pay 1.5% to somebody to keep your gold you are losing money. 
Hard to subdivide, also how do you pay 1k in gold to someone who lives across the world?.
Yep, gold is boring.

Remember that Bitcoin drop to 16k in January, and thought "looks like a good idea to sell like 1.5k, just in case of emergency", sadly was on vacation so when have to chance to sell the dump was already happening(first fall to 6k). 
But only regret on not buying a trezor at 20k and avoid using my own money :(
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:32:42

@_date: 2018-12-06 00:57:53
I was thinking about that. 
Currently miners only process TX with higher fees, and even with no fees. So maybe lightning force some kind of market for transaction. 
Too much lightning and just a few fees. Too much on chain and high fees with few users. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:27:19
Not yet, not until buy almost 0.5 BTC before next halving. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:32:29
He still can sell all those shitty tokens and alts to buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:37:34
Oopennode is also interesting, create an account, and you can receive from off chain and withdraw to on chain. 
They charged you fees but still nice if you don't run your own node.
