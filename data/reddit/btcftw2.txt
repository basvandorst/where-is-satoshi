Ignoring the headline hyperbole, this is interesting news... both because it extends the chain of BTC only economic activity, and because the seller seems confident that users with no access to paypal or credit cards would be very willing to accept the inconvenience of learning about and purchasing bitcoin, vs. the inconvenience of figuring out a bank transfer.

no they don't.  Miners "secure the network with a 51% consensus".  If nodes did, someone could just rent a huge number of AWS (amazon cloud) nodes to temporarily take over the network.  Its much harder to do that for miners because mining uses real silicon and electricity.  Full nodes do have an important role though; they keep redundant copies of the ledger.  And so its unfortunate that they are not compensated.
think about it, maybe you'll figure out how to fix the relationship...

Can you explain in more detail?  The paper I am reading ( indicates that the original messages (transactions) are necessary.  
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:34:11
Yes, and "total system work" is an odd choice of metric.  The network's capability to DO THE WORK scales by O(n) because n is the number of nodes in the system.  So the inability to do the work is O(n*t)/O(n) or O(t) -- that is linear by the number of transactions in the network.
So after all of that technical gabbling we are left with the result we knew all along:  
Your node must store every transaction which ultimately is unlikely (depending on network and storage advances) to allow the entire world to make every purchase using the native protocol.  But we sure as hell can do better than 1MB of txns every 10 minutes!

Yes, if bitcoin's block size remains at 1MB and adoption increases by 10-1000x then only very high value transactions will be able to afford the txn fees.  So at that point only banks or bank-equivalents will bother to run full nodes because only these institutions can directly use it (by aggregating customer txns).  Bitcoin would turn into a settlement mechanism for a few centralized institutions.  (Everyone has essentially a coinbase account; with associated censorship)
But if we increase the block size it may be that individuals with slow connections can no longer run full nodes at home.  BUT they will still be able to form a group and (without needing permission) collectively purchase internet and server space that is capable of running a full node.  The threat of doing this will generally be sufficient to keep the actual situations rare. 
Then there's the third option, where Bitcoin's growth stops so the above arguments are irrelevant.
Which option would you choose?

There are 2 components to this idea:
1. introduce supply side variation.  This is extremely important to create a classical supply/demand economic interaction.  Today the supply side is completely inelastic.
2. introduce a pool.  The pool idea is interesting for alt-coins to penalize miners from coin-hopping and to discourage high powered miners from destroying a coin by running up difficulty and then leaving.  But are there benefits for bitcoin?
I'd support this proposal because it is in broad strokes equivalent to my proposal (elastic block cap by txn fee) which simply specifies a minimum transaction fee T(x) where x is the location of the transaction in the block (T(x) = 0 for all x &lt; 8MB (say) and then increases superlinearly from there).  In simple english, bigger fee txns can expand the block size.  This allows the supply (space in the block) to increase for those willing to pay higher fees.
The proposals are equivalent because presumably a miner would not pay a fee into the pool unless txns in the block exceeded the fee.

Doing something like 15-30 trips over the course of a week with $500-$1000 each is not a crazy idea in this environment -- esp. if the bank "holiday" causes an employment "holiday" for a family member or two.

I tend to agree with your assessment inre Switzerland in 2015.  But you are not thinking about this properly.  You should be recognizing the limitations of your own knowledge of the subject, the allure of billions of dollars sitting on the other side of just one piece of "red tape", and acting accordingly.

To aggregate transactions, in general you must hold other people's Bitcoin on their behalf (if you didn't it would take a txn to pass it from you to the aggregator).  So the aggregator is by definition a "financial institution" (an entity that holds other people's funds).
The "lightning" network minimizes this risk quite a bit because you pay it and then it pays someone else on your behalf.  But it is technically (and therefore probably legally) holding your money for a short period of time.  Additionally, aggregators in the lightning network require float for each hop in the network.  And there will be a fee for privilege of using this float.  What I mean is that you send a txn for (say) X btc to the aggregator who does NOT submit it, and then it sends a txn to a de-aggregator peer for X btc (not submitted), who sends a new txn for X btc to the destination (possibly submitted, possibly not).  So it consumes 3*X btc. for the duration of the aggregation period (or until there is a reverse flow) to move X btc.  
The bigger the aggregator, the more likely they'll be able cut out the 2nd aggregator (me -&gt; aggregator -&gt; you rather than me -&gt; aggregator -&gt; aggregator -&gt; you) which reduces float (saves money).  And of course all the normal digital-technology scale efficiencies also apply (the cost of serving a web page to one more customer is essentially 0).  So there are large scale efficiencies in the aggregation business that will provide strong centralization forces.  
Aggregators are not going to be your friend joe, but large centralized well capitalized institutions.

They are in a debt spiral not deflationary spiral -- the Euro is inflationary.  One solution to the debt spiral is to inflate the debt away (print monetary units to pay the debt), another is to repudiate it (bankruptcy).  Either one will work.
Unfortunately, it is likely that Greece will do both.  First, repudiate the debt which "will kick them from the Euro" -- AKA their central banks will no longer be allowed to create currency to fund debt.  But physical bills don't magically disappear and so ppl can still transact in Euro (this is very important).  Greece will probably then print their own currency so they can inflate it to fund additional programs (my guess based on the politics of the empowered party), with the end result being a "socialist paradise" where basic amenities are unavailable like we see today in Venezuela.
However if Greece repudiated the debt, and then used Bitcoin or Gold, Euro, or USD as its currency it would do ok.  The Greek government is currently running a surplus without the debt payments.  
There are long-term advantages to using Bitcoin over Euro or USD though.  In theory at least, the monetary units created by inflation of the USD are spent in the USA producing no net economic gain/loss in the USA in general (although some argue that the wealth redistribution results in net economic gain, and others in economic loss).  However, if Greece adopts the USD, then the 2% USD unitary inflation essentially becomes a "tax" on Greece which is spent in the USA.  Therefore, a fixed-monetary-base currency would be better for Greece, than in inflationary one whose new units are spent outside the country.  Of course, today Bitcoin is more inflationary than the USD so this argument mostly applies for the 10 to 20 year time frame.
It could be that the "plan" is to use the Euro without a Greek central bank.  In that situation, you would want your citizens to amass the maximum possible physical currency before you repudiate all foreign-held debt.  This might be exactly what has been going on for the last few years.

If you want a benevolent overlord to ultimately responsible for your coins, coinbase or circle are likely as responsible custodians for your bitcoins as banks are with your fiat currency.
Some people on these forums are investing in Bitcoin as a hedge against financial disasters that might wipe out their bank balances like bank failures, bail-ins, or government nationalization of balances in checking accounts.  For these people coinbase, circle, or your country's equivalent would have similar risk profiles so can't be used.  They need to hold their own coin.  In that case, its best not to do so on in an unencrypted wallet on a windows machine. :-)

Author has a few good points about reasonable tipping, seemingly cut-paste from somewhere else.  Most importantly the amount of the tip: 20 years from now, tipping might be so popular that your 5 cent tip might combine with 100000 others to make something valuable, but for now I think that people should tip a minimum of a few bucks outside of Make it (almost) worth collecting.
OTOH he looks at a nascent service, thinks that what's there today is all there will ever be and therefore makes poor conclusions.  Esp. about a service that probably requires almost no maintenance.
Also, WRT privacy:  Yes it would be great to have decentralized social media and tipping.

This is a very interesting idea.  But I think you need to talk to a bitcoin expert a bit.  Its pretty easy to "run back home" to centralized solutions, and I think you do so when you say: 
"Though reading from the database would be open to anyone in the world, writing to it would require specific permission. These permissions, as well as arbitration of contradictory data submissions, would need to be managed by some independent authority, perhaps a board of directors including artists, publishers, rights societies, labels, and music services."
With blockchain technology you should be able to remove this centralized authority (and there is good reason to do so because it is yet another inefficient middleman who will end up charging lots of $ for negligible effort of registering a new song).  
I don't know much about specific rights, but here's one way to do it.  You model song ownership as an initial set of Satoshis (say 1000).  You add to this initial transaction a "fingerprint" (a hash like sha256) of the legal document claiming title to the song, and put the legal doc somewhere public.  In subsequent transactions, you hand fractions of these Satoshis out to other parties.  The amount you hand out could be proportional to ownership of the song, or not.  Subsequent transactions could also have the hash of a legal document attached.  This additional document could confer specific rights (such as printing the sheet music) to owners of those Satoshis...

If you read what I said carefully you'll see that I am not here to tell you the the FRED graph MEANS we are in a snowballing turmoil.  I am here to tell you that the FRED graph showing significant liquidity injection combined with your observed fact that published inflation is low and additional observations that are quite frankly deflationary like the price of gold, silver and oil means that we are in a very volatile situation which has a greater potential to exceed conservative forecasting than during other times.  In other words: a black swan event is more likely to happen in the next 2 years (but note that "more likely" does not mean "likely").

Right, but this strategy could have issues.  First BTC is easier to hide from physical searches and easier to carry.  Second, it can be used for international purchases without interference.  Finally, some argue that the USD's inflation is much higher than the official numbers  AND the amount of dollars has increased by 5x since 2008   This is like a coiling spring and when released it may cause high USD inflation.
So diversification makes a lot of sense.  I got into BTC for exactly this reason...
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:41:05
Pretty much entirely wrong I'm afraid. 
1. Its primary purpose really is a currency, and 
2. there is no computer system that you can buy time on (ofc some 3rd party might rent their computer for bitcoin)
3. The only purpose of the bitcoin computer network is to manage bitcoin transactions (sending coins).
4. There is no token that is a bitcoin, even a digital one.  Your balance is an entry in a distributed ledger, but there is no file (sequence of bits) that IS a particular bitcoin, for example.
5. A phone app won't use the bitcoin computer system for processing power.  It might use it to make payment easy though.
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:32:25
Are you asking or is this rhetorical?  It does more than imply.
A merged mined chain is clearly very susceptible to 51% attacks because a large mining pool can do so without even the economic impact of stopping mining BTC.

Many companies enter into a longer term trust relationship so basically take orders "net 30" which means the buyer has 30 days to pay.  However, this does expose the seller to unnecessary risk (whereas with BTC cheap multisig escrow is possible), confers an advantage on 1st world companies that can secure a good credit rating, and it creates a barrier to switching vendors.  And small but critical services, like rapid prototype turnaround are often cash-up-front and very time sensitive.  
So I think that yes international B2B is great application for bitcoin, especially when you consider that the repeat relationship and high volumes makes it worthwhile for the business to push Bitcoin as a payment method -- as compared to a business converting a single consumer.

the problem is that he implies that the bitcoin network is some kind of computing resource -- like it does voice recognition or something, and the coin and money part is secondary.

You're really drinking the cool-aid aren't you?  Maybe you ARE the cool-aid which is why your handle is "__State"?  Sorry, I don't have time to address all of your comments, you'll have to think for yourself.  But here:


It is unlikely that it happened this way, instead Gox created bitcoins on its balance sheet that didn't actually exist.  But here's your case: in 2007 the US monetary base was around 800 billion.  It took an initial infusion (money creation) of 300+ billion (37% increase) make up the shortfall.  And the economy as a whole is still dealing with the repercussions and has printed a total of  3200 billion (500% increase).  
In contrast, Gox's economic effects on Bitcoin lasted barely 3 months.
Finally, chew on this:  FinCEN requirements caused all Mt. Gox customers (was it something like 1 million+ people?) to upload identifying documentation, including passports.  This information was stolen during the Mt. Gox failure.  Now criminals may have a pool of 1 million high quality documents with which to forge illegal passports.  And these documents are the VERY ONEs required for travel.  So the US regulations that forced exchanges overseas and FinCEN identity requirements just handed terrorists a million entry documents.  
These regulations are making the problem worse.
At a very minimum, there should be 2 pages to a passport, the first page is NEVER copied or electronically transmitted and only used by immigration.  The second page is used for FinCEN identification.

here's another idea:  
The problem is that there's a big "chilling effect" when there is regulatory uncertainty because if the prosecution (govt) loses they are like "oh well", but if you lose its 30 years in jail and all your assets.
So pass a bill that allows businesses to file some kind of "statement of business method" for approval.  If the State approves the document, it protects the business and employees from criminal and punitive monetary litigation, strictly limited to the operations outlined in the statement.  Litigation can only determine that such-and-such a practice is illegal (so cease and desist) but not criminalize or punish in another fashion the mistake for the first offender.  
Without any criminal or punitive measures, the business clearly has the option to cease and desist without even going to court.  Subsequent infractions (presumably not covered by a "statement of business") by any individual or business could be criminally prosecuted.  Of course, the State could retract approval of any statement with 30-90 days of notice, etc.
Option: the State offers the same money for the defense as it is spending on the prosecution.  After all, clarity around poorly worded regulations is a public good.  Finding this clarity should not be the exclusive financial responsibility of the first person to stumble upon the poor regulation.
So for example a physical bitcoin company could file a statement essentially like:
"People send me Bitcoins.  I mint a physical coin made from silver, print a private key on it and return an equivalent value of Bitcoin in physical form minus my fee.  This is not money transfer or exchange because a person gives me bitcoins and I give them bitcoins back in a slightly different form.  So in effect value is not transferred.  This is not a bank because customer Bitcoins are not held for more than 48 working hours (the time it takes to make and ship the physical coins).   Therefore I don't need a money transfer or banking license."
If a statement like the above is accepted, the State could later determine that in fact such behavior DOES require a license.  But could not criminally prosecute the individual as part of that determination.

There are lots of reasons, but one of the smallest yet also Most compelling (for the end user) is that once you've loaded your phone some coins it really is easier and faster to pay merchants or split the lunch bill with colleagues.  Rather then having to type in a ton of info into a web site -- CC number, name, address, expiration, that "extra extra" secret number on the back -- you just point your phone camera at a QR code and then press the "pay" button.

that's great!  If you do it that way, I don't think you'd need a centralized authority to register the data... just like with bitcoin, the authority to modify a record can solely rest on the owners of the coins.  
But one very interesting observation is that you have 2 different things:  You have distinct rights (and payouts when those rights are used), such as the right to produce sheet music vs the right of radio play, and you can have fractional ownership of a particular right (that is, all payouts relating to sheet music sales go to these 3 people).  
And we can represent these 2 ideas on the blockchain either by carving up a block of coins, or by using multisignature wallets.  
What mapping makes the most sense?  Is it possible to not define the mapping a-priori but instead let people choose a representation, yet still preserve transparency and useability.  
For that matter, what properties are the most important to preserve?  I think:
1.  Strong transparent licensing property: Someone should be able to license a work and pay the license fee to the correct owners solely by looking at and transferring value in the blockchain.  In particular, it should be unnecessary to talk to any person to effect this for standard licensing requests.
2. Weak transparent licensing property: Someone should be able to license a work and pay the license fee by looking at the blockchain and associated (hash-stamped on the blockchain) legal documents.

You can't trade gold that fast. You can trade an electronic receipt stored in a centralized location that may be lost, seized, company fails, etc.  If you avoid all that some of these receipts may be redeemed for gold but in a pinch will be redeemed for the US dollar -- which is good for "all debts public and private".  By the time you get your dollar and try to buy actual gold, the price will have doubled.

This is a little misdirecting.  Bitcoin is not efficient at storing bulk information like photos.  But its very good at proving that a particular piece of information (stored elsewhere) existed at a certain point in time.  It is also good at proving and transferring ownership of a digital unit that can represent something in the real world.  So if you had a bitcoin-unlockable front door, you could go on vacation and transfer to your housesitter a key (without giving yours up).  Then when you get back she could transfer it back to you (without physically meeting) and you can be sure that the key was not copied.

The problem is that the license is too broad.  It was written to cover the billion dollar firm storing and trading currencies.  But I just want to be able to tip people on Reddit 20 cents... and a bunch of similar services.  All this stuff technically qualifies.  The bitlicense needs to set a lower bar, both in txn volume between pairs of people, and total txn volume.
Also, it is finally generally accepted and reported by the media that the financial industry today has not changed in many years, so your idea that since "nearly everyone in the financial industry is ok with this", therefore it IS ok is flawed.
And sorry to say if you are part of the industry, but recent statistics show how it has grown to serve itself rather than its customers.  For example, ongoing excessive bank and credit card fees.  Slow transfer times to create "float".  2007-8: giving mortgages to people who should not qualify so they can be bundled in lucrative financial instruments.  And of course the bailout.  Let them fail!  Also the average wall street fund significantly underperforms index funds -- profits line the pockets of the brokers.  Finally, lots of well-publicised fraud, no-one goes to jail.
This stuff that "nearly everyone" is ok with is ineffective -- it is time to reevaluate your practices.  Let Bitcoin be a "free-trade zone" where new effective policies and practices can be experimented with.

1. You card # won't be stolen and charged, forcing you to fill out forms, make statements and get them notarized to get your $ back.
2. Confidence of cash.  Your card won't be denied for some reason.  Ok this doesn't matter much for internet txns, but it matters a lot for in person txn.  Especially if you are travelling.
3. You won't need to chargeback with large vendors (they'll work it out with you without involving the CC in my experience), and anyway you'll probably lose if you do. 
4. Fees.  Sure you are basically a responsible person, but remember if you forget to pay for one month anytime in the next few years, you'll get hammered by nasty fees.  This is why CCs keep you on even if you pay regularly.  One mistake and they've made their profit from you.
5. Take the long view: Help bitcoin be successful now so in the future when you DO travel internationally or buy something direct from China you can use Bitcoin for much greater efficiency.  When your govt currency has a hiccup if not hyper-inflation or when your bank goes bail-in you have a nest egg.

No, that value is the fraction of the block that can hold your txn.  The probability of inclusion would clearly depend on the number of uncommitted txns in the network and the fees they are paying.


In both scenarios a full node could take a look at existing uncommitted transactions, and prior block contents to recommend a fee that would provide a given probability of inclusion (on average).  The difference is that in the fixed block size situation txn fees can rise out of control rapidly because the supply curve is vertical at 20MB.  Unlike traditional supply/demand economics, an infinite price cannot free up any more supply.  With my idea, supply will expand to accept additional demand (when it exists).

What you need to understand is that charges on credit cards and paypal can be reversed but a bitcoin transfer cannot.  Bitcoin is like handing someone cash.  So a common scam was to steal a credit card or paypal login and buy bitcoins with it.  Then when the charges are reversed, the person that sold the bitcoins to you ends up losing the money, and can't get his bitcoin back. 
Because of this kind of abuse, physical cash is the only way to get bitcoins quickly since handing someone cash is also not reversible.  
For all other methods, the online vendor wants to start a relationship with you -- get your ID, your bank account, validate you are who you say you are and then make you wait 30 days so if you did steal the account, the real owner has a chance to complain.

Few, if any, Bitcoiners think that Karpeles, Brewster and Shavers should go free.  Note that no laws specific to Bitcoin are needed to prosecute them.

This.  Gavin, some people will never change their minds even given overwhelming evidence.  At some point you need to simply release a version of Bitcoin with this change, and let the number of people who upgrade have the final say.  If this is done soon, we may be able to see a compelling majority before the 20mb blocks come into effect and therefore avoid a true hard fork.
And given your position within the organization, I think that it is fair that that version be on the master github repo.  People with other opinions can make their own fork.

The existence of the problem does not imply this is the solution.  Madoff's ponzi scheme (which took place in NYC) stole far more under this regulatory framework (and MANY others).  So more likely this is NOT the solution.  Its a radical idea, but perhaps the existence of these easily subverted "audits", "background checks" etc, actually encourage the public into a poorly placed trust.  
Many people left Mt Gox quickly a year before the failure because they were thinking critically and not trusting audits, etc.

The short answer is he's a Gentoo maintainer which has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  So you are using the wrong example to ask a very important question.  The answer to your actual question is that those who do the work or pay for work to be done will always have more power than someone doing nothing.  
However, with Bitcoin that power is limited.  If you do not like what they are doing you can choose not to upgrade your client and you can even grab the source code and make (or pay someone to make) the changes that you want.
If these changes are incompatible with the other work, the blockchain will "fork" which means that 2 independent branches of it will exist simultaneously.  Those who had coins before the fork will be able to spend them on both forks.  Presumably, eventually the market will settle on one of them -- causing people to sell BTCX and buy BTCY, and therefore you can tell what fork is "winning" by looking at the relative price.
This is really an amazing concept that goes beyond standard political decision making processes like democracy (rule by the majority).  Instead its like quantum mechanics; the system can simultaneously try both possibilities and as long as one person is running the fork it is still technically alive.
However, having multiple viable forks would be incredibly confusing especially for beginners, so most bitcoiners hope that it doesn't happen without a truly compelling reason.

Dear Matthew Driver,
You asked what the "appeal of a crypto-currency is?" (1:45)  Here it is in a nutshell: We don't have to trust people like you.  
You are either incredibly stupid or are so morally "flexible" that you are willing to stand up in front of the world spouting things you know are lies.
For example, that word "efficient".  I do not think it means what you think it means, given that you charge a couple % per transaction.  
You may want to look up "security" as well, given that all the info needed to issue a fraudulent charge is printed right on your card.  
And "intrinsic value"... hmm... what's the intrinsic value of a dollar bill, the paper its printed on?  
And "inclusive"... you had better look that one up given that you need a bank account and must apply for a credit card whereas Bitcoin wallets are available for everyone.
Towards the end there you seem to be saying that you think that all anonymous transactions must be illegal.  I guess you think this because you've never bought christmas presents for your SO.  Because Samsung would not benefit from knowing what Apple's R&amp;D department is purchasing.  Because the Wikileaks and Snowden revelations did not shine a beacon into governmental violations of the very laws they are supposed to uphold.
You want to give people in your company the power to look at every transaction in the world and accept only the ones that the glorious benevolent Mastercard agrees with.  No thanks! 
In that direction lies the destruction of free and democratic societies.
I feel sorry for you.  Sorry that you have to basically perjure yourself in front of the whole world.  There really isn't enough money for that to be worth it.  I recommend that you go find a job were you can be honest.

I don't think you understand the protocol.  Right now there is 1MB of space approx every 10 minutes to place transactions (a block).  The number of full nodes is irrelevant to this.  They all store copies of the same data.  By the protocol definition, the "supply" of space to store txns cannot be increased beyond the 1MB (or Gavin's proposed 20MB limit). If a miner issues a block that is larger, the other nodes will reject it.  This "feature" was originally put in the protocol when bitcoins had no value to stop jokers from spamming junk transactions into the blockchain just to waste space.
Anyway, my proposal is a small modification to Gavin's which is to not have a hard 20MB limit but to allow blocks to be larger if txn fees are bigger.  This allows the "supply" of space in each block to actually increase as demand (as measured by willingness to pay fees) increases.

@_date: 2015-05-06 14:04:13
I don't think you understand my proposal which is to basically create a function T(fee) -&gt; max location in block.  So the txn can be included in the block at any location &lt; T(fee).  
Therefore the protocol in fact requires what you are suggesting -- txns are left out of the block if they don't pay a high enough fee (and there are more pending txns than space in the block).  But at the same time, the supply (space in a block) is increased as higher paying transactions are available.
You may think that each miner should decide himself whether a transaction is paying enough.  That approach may work.  However, all nodes need to store every block so the cost of including a txn is network-wide even though only the miner gets the fee.  So there is an argument that a minimum fee for excessively large blocks should defined across all miners.
The only real risk here is that the price of BTC explodes and so the fees (in USD terms) become so excessive that no txn fees ever meet the minimum fee (this situation devolves into today's hard 20MB limit).  This is easily solved but every solution unfortunately complicates the algorithm which is why Gavin's totally simple 20MB proposal is the stopgap we need today.  But an approach to a solution would basically look at how many of the last N blocks were 100% filled without expansion/how many were filled with expansion.  If this ratio is high, txn fee is too high.  Alternately you could look at the ratio of free txns to fee txns in the last N 100% filled blocks (weighted by fee).  If there are very few free txns (they are being crowded out), reduce the fee needed to expand the block.

you are probably right, which is why my example fee doubles the txn fee every extra MB.  So we aren't going to get too far away from 20MB blocks.  But at the same time there IS some flexibility in supply so supply/demand equations work.

S/he could give some to a friend electrician/plumber or whatever saying, "you're heading into the city?  There's a place to change these there if you want to."  The existence of a prominent mechanism to cash out makes it easier to spread the currency to secondary and tertiary users.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:41:43
The mechanism I'm proposing is slightly different.  Basically IF you pay a higher fee your txn can be placed "beyond" the normal block size limit.  So let's say the "limit" is 20MB.  If your txn has a fee of 1uBTC, it can be placed in the block anywhere from 0-21MB -- essentially the block limit is extended by 1MB, but the last 1MB can only be used for txns paying 1uBTC or more.  (of course I'm just making up these numbers right now)
So rather than a "hard" limit of 20MB, we have a "soft" limit that allows supply to expand for those txns that pay for it.
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:21:41
That's the point of releasing the code of course... to see what node operators support it.  
However, my personal opinion is that decreasing bitcoin nodes has very little to do with block size.  And decreasing nodes has little to do with Bitcoin's eventual success.  Instead I believe that we are seeing the transformation of the network from enthusiasts and hobbyists who were running nodes for no real purpose to nodes being run by actual significant economic participants.  Please consider that its actually a BAD idea to run a full node with a Bitcoin balance in it (unless you are doing lots of daily txns).  You are basically running a "hot wallet".  Much more secure to just start up your wallet when you need it.
And you may be confused by thinking that just because the max block size is lifted to 20MB that means there will be lots of 20MB blocks the next day.  I suppose that if that were the case we'd be seeing lots of 1MB blocks today.  But we are not.
Regardless, the above is irrelevant.  For Bitcoin, like many things, its grow or die.  Bitcoin's value continues to be based on its promise as a universal value transfer network.  If this starts looking unlikely we really will see double digit coins or lower as holders move to more exciting opportunities.
I would prefer we die trying to be a universal value transfer network (which I think VERY unlikely at 20MB) than to die because we didn't even try.

IANAL but how about really driving hard: a law that basically says if a customer accesses the website of a NH incorporated and/or NH hosted service than that transaction is considered to have taken place entirely and solely within NH and shall be governed exclusively by NH (and federal of course) laws.  This would stick it right to other overreaching states (NY), and if they actually do pass overreaching laws would render these laws unenforceable (at least in NH).

Here's an outline: In Brazil HSBC ATMs were the only way for me to get cash (international traveller), but only $150 per day.  Credit card acceptance is spotty and it can be frightening to be in a foreign country, not speak the language and not be able to pay for the gas you just put in your car :-(.  Cash is king in these situations.  If HSBC ATMs accepted Bitcoin and dispensed cash this problem would be solved for visitors.  And since Bitcoin charges cannot be reversed, HSBC does not need to worry about risks due to fraud and chargebacks.

I'm not throwing a monkey wrench in the works with what I'm about to say because Gavin's right, we need bigger blocks now.
  
However all you guys who are into supply/demand curve analysis (economic analysis) should realize that supply (block space) has a HARD limit.  In real life, if the demand (price) is high enough, new supply appears to meet it.  The way Bitcoin is currently organized that does not happen.  The block size is fixed.  So traditional analysis using the supply demand curve does not work.  Its a cliff.  If demand is on average 110% of current supply, the Bitcoin network will never be able to commit all transactions.  People will leave the network.
But actually, this suggests an interesting solution.  Create a supply/demand curve by creating a variable supply:
Any-fee txns are accepted in the first 20MB of each block.  Beyond that, txns must pay a fee, say start at 1 uBTC and multiply by 2 for each additional megabyte (of course, someone would have to analyze this carefully to see what the suggested per MB fee is, and ideally allow it to vary).
So if you created a txn with a 64uBTC fee, your txn could be placed within the first 26 MB (20 + log2(64)) of a block. 
So there is no "hard" block limit.  Additional supply is created as txn fees go up.
You could probably price this properly (within an order of magnitude anyway) by looking at the historical relationship between BTC price and # transactions.
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:37:06
Interesting.  Certainly I wouldn't know if something was in the protocol at one point but was dropped.  
But that sounds a little different than what I was advocating, which would be (in theory) an unlimited-size block so long as people are willing to pay higher and higher fees.  So supply actually increases.  Of course in practice there would be a limit to the block size, unless BTC's value dropped to zero -- in which case we won't be filling up blocks anyway.  [ok the above ignores "reducto ad absurdum" edge cases: of course the maximum block size is when all 21M coins are spent as txn fees]
@_date: 2015-05-26 02:59:38
Yes but that has nothing to do with this post.
This post suggests a way to allow network neutrality to co-exist with differentiated services (i.e. dynamic QOS flows per customer).  Service differentiation is typically considered anathema to network neutrality because ISPs need to actively "choose" to allow some service to have dynamic QOS.  So for example, the ISP's favorite internet video provider gets high bandwidth flows for cheap, but Netflix does not or has to pay a lot.  Or the ISP denies access to dynamic QOS to porn distributers for public relations reasons...
This post solves this problem by suggesting the creation of an open market for the purchase of dynamic QOS flows.  
Bitcoin enables this market to function by allowing purchasers to be pseudo-anonymous (ensuring fair pricing).  Bitcoin also solves the fraud issues that hamstring the use of traditional payment networks for digital assets.  As an asset (rather than a liability) the ISP does not need to deal with customer identity data protection, account management, and delinquent account collection.
The emerging OpenFlow protocol will make it possible to create a market that covers the dynamic flow end-to-end.

The devs only offer software.  You do not need to run it.  As soon as someone created software that breaks the current issuance schedule the blockchain would fork into 2 separate chains -- the original 21M software and the new "inflatacoin" software.  Any holders would have coins on BOTH chains because the coins you have can be independently spent on each chain.  Nobody wants the value of their coins to be inflated away, so people would rapidly sell on the "inflatacoin" chain and buy on the 21M chain.  The value of an "inflatacoin" would decline to zero.

This is like dividing the wind power in the Pacific ocean by the number of sailboats and concluding that sailing is not energy efficient.
The hashing power (wind) exists because of the block subsidy which is orthogonal to the number of txns (# sailboats).
What is interesting about bitcoin is how the cost structure is inverted (when the block subsidy is no longer relevant).  The cost of traditional transaction mechanisms is priced based on the infrastructure required to execute the transaction (plus profit).  With bitcoin, the cost of the infrastructure (hash rate) will be priced based on the sum of the transaction fees.
Today, miners mine txns to reap the block subsidy.  They generally don't mine empty blocks because without a viable Bitcoin network they can't cash out their subsidy.
In the future, miners will not mine transactions that they cannot profit from by turning off their hashing power.  When a profitable block can be constructed, they will turn their ASICs back on.  This will reduce hash rate to whatever the users are willing to pay.  
Users are probably willing to pay something that is less than competing money transfer options (although the other pros/cons of the Bitcoin currency will also influence this).  Therefore the hashing power of the network will size itself to ensure that Bitcoin remains competitive.  
How does this analysis impact our holy war?  Well, larger blocks will therefore result in a higher network hash rate, less cost per txn, and a smaller minimum (practical) txn value.
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:11:48
Multiply that "very small" amount by every state/province in every country of the world and you end up with a nightmare.  
Additionally, even though the cost is 5k, its looking like it will cost a LOT more in manpower.
And finally, the "if you change something, you must get our OK" clause is complete BS.  Since its impossible to change nothing and run a successful business it basically allows the state of NY to criminally prosecute any license holder at any time.  So you are trusting NY to be reasonable about what that ambiguous clause means -- a situation that can devolve rapidly if the changing individuals in the NYDFS results in corrupt officials... and unfortunately as we discovered with Carl Mark Force (or whatever his name is) and Mt.

The advantages of gift and loyalty cards are well documented.  I think that they primarily accrue because users will not go to competitors. Also some % are lost or not used.  So these discounts are (generally) not a scam.  The merchant is actually wholesaling the cards at a large discount.  Otherwise how does gyft and the grocery store with the gift card display (to many different stores) make money?
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:52:45
IMF is projecting 20% for 2015.  Other estimates come in near 30%.  Within that context, the possibility of losing 10% seems like not taking a big risk, esp. given the possibility of appreciation.  And those "freeze" companies have counterparty risk.  
Regardless, I don't think the OP is talking about converting his friend's entire savings to Bitcoin.  While he may hold some BTC, the most important point is that it can be used to move value out of (and back into) the country and into more stable currencies and assets in international markets.

Its difficult to model the miner's reaction to block reward halving because we do not know the variation in miner profitability, and only have one data point.  This one data point seemed unlikely -- hash rate recovered quickly.
A hostile actor cannot steal your coins via mining superiority; it can only prevent you from spending them.  Therefore such an attack is limited to non-economic actors.  These actors would be more likely to simply declare Bitcoin illegal than to bother spending the money to gain a majority of hash power.  
However, the question 'how much hash power is "enough" to secure the network' remains extremely important but is unfortunately completely unknowable because like the Drake equation (esp. when originally formulated), it requires too many completely unknown inputs.

I tend to agree but think that its better than no ability to change the block size at all.
You may fear that miners optimize the area of the box under the supply demand curve in the manner we all learned about in macro-economics 101 when you have a monopoly.  This will reduce the block size to the point where users have to pay more per txn.
On the other hand, this will also drive micro-transactions (low fee txns) away from Bitcoin which miners must realize is a very dangerous game since Bitcoin is only better than certain alt-coins because of the network effect.
Also, miners compete, so more space-efficient miners can vote a higher value both to run other miners out of business and because they are more profitable at higher block sizes.
Personally, I prefer BIP101 (Gavin's hard-coded 8MB limit that slowly increases) because miners can ALREADY "vote" for a block of size N by simply making their own blocks size N.  And the miner can refuse to build on top of a newly-mined egregiously-sized block, so it seems unlikely that a 1GB block filled with junk would be accepted.  It also takes more time to propagate these large blocks so a larger block increases the risk that another miner will find a solution that competes with yours (and therefore stealing your block reward).
@_date: 2015-07-01 02:40:38
1. cost is artificially high due to mining reward.
2. energy cost will not increase much if we ever scale the block size, so the cost could drop by a factor of 8 or something if only the core devs would compromise.

@_date: 2015-08-28 17:27:01
Yes, the decentralized nature does add cost which might ultimately affect the minimum transfer.  However other features reduce cost, like being irreversible, trustless, and permissionless.  Also its easy to create a txn, and has a simple account structure (easy to specify a payment address).
So a scaled-block Bitcoin might compete with centralized systems on the strength of these other efficiencies.  And it seems like overlays like LN or the plain old centralized overlay like changetip will dramatically outcompete.
I think that you are trying to discourage use of this feature because IIRC you want to keep the 1MB block size.

However in the current system there is positive pressure for miners to not destroy the value of the token that they mine by doing things that would destroy the blockchain like 51%ing, blacklisting, etc because the miner would not be able to convert to fiat without using the very blockchain he destroyed.
In a system where the mining reward is an external currency, if a malicious agent could grab tons of fees with the effect of destroying trust in the system, he would profit from doing so.  The disincentive is gone.

Ahhh,  I've been to Campinas and Ubatuba twice and if ever there was a place that needed BTC but has ignored it (so far) it is Brazil.  It was a nightmare to withdraw cash from ATMs there.  The only ATM that worked for me was HSBC and that had a 24 hour limit that was under my average daily spending (when you include hotel, taxis, etc).  And credit card acceptance through those handheld scanners you find in restaurants, gas stations and the smaller hotels is spotty.  I got into the habit of paying for hotels in advance so we had time to retry the CC reader during my stay and hoarding "just in case" cash.

I'd actually agree with your argument.  If, in practice, people MUST use an exchange to transfer to 3rd parties then the larger "bitcoin" ecosystem is centralized even though the portion that the exchanges use (the bitcoin blockchain) may not be.  
You think that the Mt Gox failure did not reflect poorly on Bitcoin?  Why were so many people working on decentralized exchanges?
A LN node is practically the definition of a money transmitter  -- you pay it, it pays the merchant.  I don't see how it will possibly avoid all the legal requirements.  
If you limit the blockchain to 1MB therefore forcing everyone into LN, a ruling like a LN node is a money transmitter is going to destroy bitcoin -- by that I mean cut txns by 10x-&gt;100x overnight, for example.  And I assure you, such a ruling will not happen when LN is nascent -- it will happen only when LN nodes are moving a huge amount of money, because that's how the regulatory infrastructure works.  If LN nodes don't preemptively register with FinCen, The worry that this might happen will exert a chilling effect on businesses that want to base there revenue model on these payments.
I'm "for" the Lightning network... if you scale the blockchain reasonably, you give LN a chance to answer these questions, and let LN grow handling micro-payments.  There's a huge untapped micro-payment market, from changetip to ad-free web sites (via automatic penny payment to the site).
This issue is a LOT bigger then the technical situation which is what too many people here are primarily focused on.

The reality is that companies and the officers have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders and cannot just give money away with no strings attached.  But these can be very thin strings... the bitcoin public's fear that every single bitcoin-related company has an evil master plan to destroy bitcoin and therefore their own business model is just silly.
And finally I do not think that Gavin and other core devs are the willing dupes you all watch on nighttime television.  They are not going to bow to "corporate overloads" for a salary which, in Gavin's case at least, is certainly less then he could pull in the open market.
But the key ingredient in this strange brew we call Bitcoin is transparency... and its hilarious how it seems that EVERY time people start complaining about a lack of it -- in exchanges, in ASIC developers, in mining efforts, in the Foundation, in that cyprus "bank" -- we get a SHTF event about 6 months later.  The weakest element in the Bitcoin protocol are the humans at either end.
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:23:10
Full nodes wouldn't be required to be LN nodes.  So the point therefore is that LN increases centralization (compared to using full nodes today)  LN nodes &lt;&lt; full nodes.
Unless, ofc, multiple LN nodes use a single full node.
Personally, I think that there will be centralization pressures in LN having to do with the time value of the money required to do a 2 hop LN.  If I pay the LN X BTC and then the LN pays my merchant, the LN needs an extra X BTC while both payments are in play.  The situation is even worse with the 4 hop LN payment ( Me -&gt; LN -&gt; LN -&gt; merchant) that would be typical if there are a lot of LN nodes.  That briefly consumes 3 times more BTC than my single payment.  So there is a significant centralization efficiency in LN.

yeah, like I was saying the problem isn't with Bitcoin but the people on either side.  Eventually companies will actually use the features in Bitcoin to prevent some of this (multi-sig wallets, with one key held by the customer, the other by the company).  But Bitcoin is not and has never been some kind of final social solution, no matter what some head-in-the-clouds evangelists imply.  We will always need law enforcement, judges and juries to deal with larger problems that are actually about human greed and corruption even though bitcoins may have replaced dollars, diamonds or gold as the mechanism of the value theft.

This is also not quite true which makes Bitcoin truely fascinating.  The real situation is that the 51% can't force the 49% into a choice they don't want to follow.  The 49% can continue to use their forked Bitcoin currency.  
In a situation like increasing the inflation schedule, this fact -- that the uninflated bitcoin fork will still be useful and active -- will ultimately destroy the increased fork as the price of the uninflated coins rise relative to the inflated ones.  Inflation, like debasing the coinage, only works when its forced onto its users.

I'm not sure you should connect the advice portion with the medication selling portion.
Given freedom of speech (in many countries) and the fact that any "doctor" posting is not doing so with the authority of the state (i.e. a medical certification) behind him, the advice portion of your service may be perfectly legal or at least in such a grey area that the state would not want to expend resources.  I mean even today you can head over to webmd and get some comment section "advice" for what its worth.
However, a service whose members illegally resell or even import generics in bulk quantities into patent-protected regions is going to attract the notice of the hugely capitalized and motivated drug companies.
So I think it would make sense to at a minimum keep these two functions separate, and honestly (IMHO), not do the resell perscription drugs portion so you can avoid jail. 
Also, maybe allow HTML5 web video chat for face to face consultation... doctors really need to see their patients.

You have to remember that in a scam or ponzi money is constantly draining from the system.  But with Bitcoin value is injected into the system every time:
1. some merchant saves 1-2% (or more for international purchases), 
2. a foreign worker saves 5-10% in remittance, 
3. people the world over save TIME (the most valuable commodity) not doing a painful wire transfer, 
4. micropayments happen for media
5. internet tipping and other emerging applications happen
The problem is, these are small, constant and therefore boring injections of value as compared to 10000 people suddenly deciding they need coinz NOW :-).  
But a constant leak will overflow a bathtub eventually and that's what we saw up until about early october when the speculators started noticing and buying coins.

If you are looking for 50k BTC contact miners, payment processors and whales to see if you can buy direct.  Also, sign up for multiple exchanges if you can: bitfinex gemini coinbase circle (you might be prevented at some of these because of the NY DFS bitlicense).   Also I think Silbert's second market may still sell to your volume. 
Multiple exchanges will spread your risk and allow you to acquire more coins faster (because most of these places have weekly limits).  If the bitlicense forces you into a low volume exchange (Gemini right now?) put a big buy wall above the average price on other exchanges.  That will signal to sellers and arbs that there is a big buyer on the exchange who is willing to make it worth an arb's time to get coins on the exchange.  
How much above is enough?  Well, IDK people's analysis always differ so you might get someone who arbs too low.  But keep in mind that the BTC market is very different then the highly liquid stock markets you are used to.  Here is my analysis: The arb has to move your USD out of the thin exchange into another one to rebuy his coins.  Let's say this takes 2 fiat bank transfers.  So probably 3 business days in fiat best case.  If the price of BTC is appreciating on average $10 a day right now (just a guess), he's out the market for $30 of the run up.  Ofc, that appreciation is not a guarantee while an arb is (except for the counteparty risk undertaken by the arb)... so some arbs may go for less.
This reality is probably why the Chinese exchanges (which are experiencing great demand right now) are running about $20-$40 above other exchanges.  It takes that kind of premium to attract arbs.

True but:
1. The network adjusts itself to ensure that the cost of this is less than what the network can handle.  The "owners" cannot shut off the service and disappear leaving you with nothing because if all the professional miners leave any user can just start mining him/herself (note I don't realistically think that this will happen).
2. The users know exactly how much value will be drained in this manner -- it cannot exceed the ratio of unmined coins to total coins.  So the drain due to mining will cause your coins to lose 6.2/21 or 30% of their value over MANY years.  After the next block halving (happening in a few months) the yearly loss in value will be comparable to many fiat currencies (around 4.5% I think).  And after the one after that the yearly loss will be even lower (~2%).

No, that's why I put "mandatory" in quotes.  We should not do this at the protocol level.  But IIRC it is done at the client level.  So you'd need to modify the bitcoin core source code to produce blockchain spam without paying a fee.  And miners have incorporated the algorithm into their code AFAIK... so they can distinguish between "normal" txn that is paying a low or no fee and somebody who is fooling around.  And ultimately its the miner's choice whether they are willing to include a low or no fee txn.  Anecdotally, a long time ago I modified the client to issue non-zero txns that were about 1/10th the bitcoin core default value.  Judging by how long they took to confirm, these txns were basically treated by the miner's similar to zero fee...

LOL, guys you read it there.  His plan is for Bitcoin to stop growing.  
"**fees become become so high that users won't pay them**. The thing is, that can't actually happen because **once users stop using Bitcoin**, the fee income drops and **hashpower decreases**, decreasing costs for remaining miners"
So users stop using Bitcoin (and start using something else), fee income drops, and hashpower decreases (miners start mining something else).
Sounds to me like the death of Bitcoin and the rise of a not-yet-developed scalable competing crypto-currency.

Yes you are correct.  It would work fine; especially since there is a natural "penalty" for larger blocks (longer propagation time).  See Peter R's paper for a formal framework of the idea.
People will attempt to tell you otherwise but its all just the speculation of people who pay lip service to ideas like decentralization and the free market but are actually creating a centralized process to enforce their vision of "decentralization".

Some of Bitcoin's promise is for future potential (when everybody uses it), some can be realized today.  But without use today we'll never reach that potential.  So to some degree if you accept Bitcoin you are doing it for the future even if it might not (or it might) pay for itself now.  I think that you make that clear and then move forward discussing the future potential.
You might distinguish 2 parts to you talk.  
  1. Why the ad agency should take bitcoin, 
  2. and why the agency should push clients to incorporate bitcoin. 
[advantages to ad agency]
 1. Ask them about payment pain points and contract disputes; introduce multi-sig transactions.  First for escrow: using 2-of-3 you don't even have to trust the escrow agent.  Second, using 2-of-2 is sort of a "good enough" escrow because if the client chooses not to pay, the money remains forever in limbo.
Many aspects of advertising are mostly digital (print ad creation, etc) meaning you can just email the product to the customer.  With Bitcoin you can accept worldwide business easily because payment is as easy as email.
[advantages to customer (ad campaign)]
 2. Bitcoin has advantages to the merchant (briefly describe) and more importantly has an iconoclast perception which appeals to certain demographics.  Historically the first-mover announcement that company X is taking Bitcoin gets lots of news coverage generating a one-time "pop" in sales.  There are lots of examples like overstock to Google about...

you have to be willing to pay the local seller's time... if s/he's got to meet you somewhere a 5% markup barely covers it at $200 ($10 profit for the seller).  Exchanging only $50 would get the seller $2.50; not enough to bother with.  You might get someone to show if you offer to give the seller a flat fee.

Look, I can see that it might be unfortunate for you.  But we sort of have a dichotomy of bad choices here.  Let me break it down:
Option 1. Limited block size:
  1.a: Bitcoin successful:  Competition in txn fees makes them too high for the average joe to issue a txn.  Bitcoin blockchain is used for large settlement between financial svc companies like circle.  We end up with the very middleman infrastructure Bitcoin was created to avoid.  End users are not interested in being full nodes b/c they can't issue txns that will be accepted anyway.
  1.b: Bitcoin unsuccessful:  The excitement of being an early adopter fades, end users not interested in being full nodes anyway.
  1.c: Bitcoin similar to today: no issues
Option 2: Scaling the max block size over time
  2.a: Bitcoin successful, exceeds Moore's law:  End users submit transactions through a middleman.  Note that they can still hold their coins, etc.  Much better outcome than 1.a
  2.b: Bitcoin successful, does not exceed Moore's law:  End users can still be full nodes
  2.c: Bitcoin stagnates (adoption like today):  Block sizes are not filled so end users have no problem being full nodes even if network/disk bandwidth does not increase.
  2.d: Bitcoin unsuccessful: End users don't care to be full nodes anyway.
So its very simple.  All outcomes in option 2 are better than option 1.  Yes, all outcomes are not positive.  But the negative outcomes in option 2 (scale block size) are LESS BAD than the negative outcomes in option 1 (limit block size).

The problem is occurring on many fronts and is caused by the increasing requirement for business and technical mediation to support basic life activities and constitutionally protected rights.  For example, freedom of speech is protected but a business can shut down your web site at its discretion and often does so due to fear of litigation by fringe groups.  You can theoretically pay for something with cash, but the lack of high denomination bills, asset forfeiture laws, expected individual productivity, and social convention make it extremely inconvenient to do so.

The system can be in multiple states simultaneously until an observation (block discovery) collapses the state into a single time flow.  If multiple blocks are found near-simultaneously this state uncertainty can persist for those who observe the dual blocks until another observation is made.  
Similarly observations made inside a "black box" don't change the uncertainty (collapse the wave function) from the perspective of someone outside the box.  You just become part of the uncertainty (schrodinger's cat).  For example, someone could suddenly post an alternate block history that forked off of "our" blockchain history in 2010.  If that history has more work then the network will "collapse" to that blockchain and our history will be replaced (in theory anyway).  At that point we will all realize that we've been the cat inside the schrodinger's box...
If the 1MB spam limit remains enforced by a minority of users, the blockchain will fork and your coins will simultaneously exist on both forks.  Basically your coins are like particles existing in all possibilities simultaneously.

Bitcoin's "killer app" right now is not custom boutiques because the intersection of probabilities of people who have BTC and want hemp based soaps is extremely low.  Also people tend to defer luxury purchases in times of economic hardship, so the bubble pop is depressing sales.
I hope that you understand the above and continue to accept Bitcoin because the only way to solve the chicken-and-egg problem (consumers don't hold BTC because merchants don't take it and merchants don't take it because consumers don't have it) is for some people to accept or hold it even if it is not providing immediate economic benefit.

I didn't listen to the podcast but I think that you are talking about "colored coins" -- or the practice of attaching a specific meaning to a particular bitcoin beyond that of the bitcoin itself.  For example, you could put 100 oz of gold in a vault and then through a legal document "attach" ownership of that gold to ownership of 100 very specific 1 microBTC units.  If prove ownership of one of these microBTC, you can take 1oz of gold out of the vault.
If this is your question then the answer is that in that case we WANT fungibility to be disrupted.  Because those 100 microBTC individually have additional value "attached" to them, we need to be able to track and distinguish them from other microBTC.  There's nothing special about BTC to do this.  You could write "this note entitles the bearer to 1 cheeseburger" on a dollar bill and give it to someone.  However, someone could copy your handwriting, etc.  So Bitcoin's existing properties (not counterfeitable for example), and the existence of "colored-coin enabled" wallets make it easy to do this.

Another possible explanation is that you are generating the spam just so you can make this argument.  Just because something is possible does not mean it is likely or is happening.
How do you know that other miners can't handle larger blocks?  Can you trust miners to accurately report this when perhaps the *can* handle them but not as efficiently as other miners.  Why should you get to choose to confer an advantage to miners with expensive bandwidth &amp; cheap energy costs over miners with cheap bandwidth &amp; expensive energy costs?  The latter (cheap bandwidth, expensive energy) covers many small or even home miners BTW, whereas the former is often an effect of situating a dedicated, centralized mine near a cheap (and therefore remote) source of energy.
If it really was impossible for many miners to handle the large blocks, we'd be seeing a lot more 0 txn blocks.
And the 0 txn block is unfortunately the way a low bandwidth miner can still mine so its existence basically blows your spam explanation away (you can mine a 0-tx block on top of a big block if you just receive the hash).

Irrespective of whether you are "for" or "against" Kim Dotcom, file sharing or end-to-end encryption, the fact that a senator can essentially destroy a business without due process should be of great concern to anyone who believes in an independent justice system, democracy, and capitalism.  Especially when the business is not even located in that senator's country!  
Right now Bitcoin may not be pervasive enough to keep this company afloat but hopefully in the future it will make tactics like this impossible.  This is why some of us encourage Bitcoin (by spending it direct or via Gyft for example) even though paypal or credit cards might be a more convenient option today (although, I have say, once its set up on your phone its super easy!).

When an industry starts to prey upon its own customers, it is ripe for disruption and an implosion.  The financial industry is particularly vulnerable because it is a zero-sum game with significant information asymmetry.  The mortgage scandals of 2008 can be seen through this lens.  The pressure to bundle and resell mortgages was so great that individuals (without strong financial sense) were encouraged by banks to take loans that they could not afford: "If the bank lets me have this loan, I must be good for it."

There is not one "block" that all miners are working on.  Every miner creates its own block and fills it with transactions.  Therefore a miner can fill his OWN block with bogus transactions, but never broadcast these txns to the rest of the miners.
If you had lots of processing power, you might be able write custom code that attempts to steal these txns in the following manner:
1. You discover a block and do not publish it.
2. Miner issues big block
3. You issue your block to fork the network.
4. You start mining a new block on your fork with all the miner's transactions in it.
5. the miner is now racing you for a block on his fork.
6. you win sometimes.
But its pretty stupid to find a block and sit on it due to the block subsidy (coinbase txn) so its unlikely miners would try to do this.

That's a fair bit of change!  I think that there's a possibility that you'd show up and your CC wouldn't work for $10500 in some 2nd or 3rd world medical tourism country even if you've "enabled" it there.  
So if you know the other side accepts BTC, there's the "confidence of cash" aspect to consider... the txn is just between you and them so intermediary can stop it.   And given CC rates and currency exchange fees you could probably negotiate a discount.
On the minus side, you can't chargeback if the operation does not go as planned.  However you could probably negotiate a "half now, half after" kind of deal or use escrow.

Ok I purposely was hurtful to try to shock you out of your marketing speak which because various ventures have failed in the the BTC space is becoming associated with scammer companies.  
Why am I doing this?  Because I like the concept of bitreserve...
 If you seriously think your comment made sense, let me break down your comment to explain how while it might fly in as some kind of marketing release it doesn't fly so well on reddit with bitcoiners. 
CC said "so when exchanging BTC to BitUSD, you actually selling coins for usd and then holding my USD?"
you said "No CC-- that would make us a bank."
But then you do not actually say HOW you solve the problem of the value of BTC changing relative to other assets. 
Instead you say "Our reserve is a mechanism by which we substantiate the value of the cloud-based virtual assets we enable."
This is obvious since it is the definition of reserve.  However as others have commented you have obfuscated the fact that it is merely a definition by using buzzwords and atypical phrasing like "substantiate the value" rather than "back".
Next you say "Our reserve assets substantiate the value of our bitassets."
So you're just repeating yourself.
"And our real-time transparency--something Coinbase really should adopt--means that anyone at anytime anywhere can confirm that our system is solvent and has sufficient liquidity,..."
So now you use the classic marketing technique of misdirection -- you pull the customer's attention where you want it away from the hard questions. 
However, this is statement is in fact untrue.  In reading your website, it turns out you do not have real time transparency.  In fact your finances are audited quarterly.  Which is very laudable, BTW!  But tor true real time transparency I would expect a mechanism like a web API for public access directly into 3rd party banks and phys holding companies and query your balance with them.
