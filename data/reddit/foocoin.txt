This sounds decent but why Blockstream is missing from supporters?
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:46:23
Probably, but we could end to have two year of bear market.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:03:08
Correction is coming, so it probably drops. If you're willing to hodl four years price will be more than $10k or zero.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:32:46
Shits gonna hit the fan.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:40:01
It's not anymore about SegWit or HF. It's about stubborn egoistic people and power grab AND that's what will make impact on price.

This shit is unreal

Decentralized bitcoin is centralized to one country and one person: Jihan.

That's only 1/3 of tokens.

Wake up man... different times different things. BTC is tiny and it takes time. Now is not time to pump this much higher than it is now.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:50:25
Well, it works both ways: you can also argue "segwit or else". I'm pro segwit, but whole thing has turned political from both sides and I don't like it. I would prefer to see first segwit without any strict time line to do HF and see how it scales and then HF when needed.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:10:00
It's encrypted before it is written from phone ram to phone storage section and this is important because security of your phone can be compromised (rooted phone) and malware can swipe you storage area. If you lost your phone you can use new phone with your username + password combination to download your encrypted private key from Airbitz cloud.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:51:14
100% agree.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:31:52
Surely, but it's not yet sure how things will play out... If you're going to buy bitcoins better to dollar cost average.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:33:27
It was very disturbing to watch Bitpay CEO talking about that their business needs big block fork of Bitcoin... Seems that there are people who want force contentious HF.
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:05:41


Of course it's option. We, users choose how we upgrade our protocol. Not miners. Not developers.
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:49:02
One does not hodl BTC on mobile wallets.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:11:53
Well, we need to something because otherwise Jihan and Roger block us forever.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:29:49
NO! Polo is not safe in any circumstances. Withdraw your coin immediately.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:39:24
Shits gonna hit the fan if UASF activates. Bitcoin needs to find consensus with SegWit2x before that.. If that doesn't happen it's better to dump your coins.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:31:08
Let's do this.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:06:17
If HF happens you will have bitcoins on both chains. Because money is ultimate power and it corrupts ppl.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:23:34
You can HODL through it.
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:14:29
Sounds more like obsession.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:41:57
I know, but devices get lost, broken etc. Cloud where keys are stored should be open and accessible without Airbitz.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:08:09
Neither. Use HW wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:08:08
No, you should first learn basics about bitcoin and then buy small amount of it. Try different wallets and send some bitcoins with your friends back and forth. KEEP learning and start buying bitcoins with some percentile of your monthly salary.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:17:54
What happens is that nothing happens and current situation remains.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:10:17
Jihan can censor your expensive and slow censorship resistant transactions whenever he wants.
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:18:41
That's why foam has so many bubbles.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:13:59
I think your wallet is really good for noobs and in general for people who use it for spending/temporary storage. In general mobile wallets should have only similar amount of value than your physical wallet. If you hold serious amounts of BTC you _NEED_ to know how to secure them properly and without any trust to centralized party.
I think Airbitz does good job to make secure mobile wallet for casual bitcoin users.

There will be no writing on the wall that Jihan splits bitcoin at specific date. Just look around what's happening and it looks like they're preparing to that with all anti SegWit FUD and second coming of fake Satoshi. This is their last straw.

It's not repost. Link is obviously different; Idk if content is same at some other post.

Scaling issues will not be solved with consensus. There will be at least two bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:48:52
I think you're not shocked if price plummets overnight because you believe that price will recover and even rise from previous highs. Don't spend your precious coins for car/boats/etc crap... just hoard and hodl and enjoy your freedom.

Don't watch shit like that; morons and charlatans are irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:45:55
Hard to say, but if you want to get in you need to do it eventually; you might get in and prices crashes or you might be lucky and it pumps. It really doesn't matter... Just HODL.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:36:54
Retarded idea: Jihan controls also Litecoin.

@_date: 2017-05-17 11:25:53
This is getting out of hand... Instead of creating altcoin we should focus on not hating each other. I'm pro SegWit, but I don't want to see multiple Bitcoin chains. I think we need more space regardless of SegWit sooner or later and I would be happy to see coordinated 2mb + SegWit upgrade.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:57:29
Just read between the lines.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:26:36
It's easy and good wallet for noobs because security model of it is simple for users, but _ONLY_ if you create strong username + password combination which will be used to encrypt your private key before it is written to phone memory. Airbitz also backups your encrypted private key to their cloud (not sure if it's possible for user to retrieve it if Airbitz goes bust).
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:16:07
No it will not be like normal day and after that we will have two or three bitcoins. Hodlers don't want see their wealth dump 90%. If bitcoin splits it's end of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:50:32
Slight dip? Why would you risk your precious coins for that? Sounds like you're gambling.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:28:01
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:41:58
We leave that 2xHF crap... Only SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 09:09:47
Coinbase is like bank, meaning that you don't own your coins and they can do whatever they want with them. With breadwallet you're in control of your own money (if you can use it with your own node).
Breadwallet is just mobile wallet... With that in mind use it just like you use your normal wallet; don't store excessive amounts in it.
HW wallet for HODLING and mobile wallet for spending. Get rid of coinbase ASAP.

@_date: 2017-05-18 12:08:53
At this point both big blocks and Segwit seems to be tools to drive political agenda. I don't fucking care about this name calling and finger pointing.
Let's start this from clean desk and move on with 2mb HF + Segwit. We'll need extra space regardless of Segwit anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:09:27
Both chains will have 21m coins. Probably not: look what happened with ETH and ETC.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:44:27
SegWit2x is just stalling tactic.
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:41:24
Will some miners run and test this beta code in production?
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:10:51
Absolutely, but be prepared that price might crash after you buy. If you'll be hodling then there's no problem.
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:13:44
If this is not sign that we're at top of bubble Idk what is.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:48:06
Take a closer look at Bitmain post: _"Later, we will support the activation of SegWit on the UAHF chain if there is no patent risk associated with SegWit"_
This means that Jihan will not activate SegWit if it removes ASICBoost compatibility.
Jeff is at the same boat with Jihan (surprise, surprise...)

@_date: 2017-06-08 09:06:09


Why would you hope for that? We already have SegWit altcoin which is basically Bitcoin with 4xsupply and block time and different mining algorithm. I don't see any point of creating another one.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:49:11

Jihan keeps milking fees from users.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:21:20
My point was that we don't want to create altcoin out of Bitcoin chain. If we can't get SegWit for Bitcoin we need to enable 2nd layer protocols without it.
Bitcoin protocol cement is drying up fast and it'll only get harder to deploy changes for that.
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:26:00
Don't wait next 45 years to retire. We'll have +$10k coins at next halving... Retire then.

Enough of this rushed power struggle. Do we have so powerful egos that bitcoin needs to be destroyed? UASF is rushed proposal. Participants needs to meet in the middle ground; SegWit2x is for that.
Idk why UASF proponents want to risk their fork creating new altcoin with segwit. Why don't they just use Litecoin?
With controversial HF bitcoin is done.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:55:16
Blockstack (onename.io) probably makes namecoin irrelevant. Maybe we need to drop namecoin merge mining support.

There's no problem with confirmation times; pay correct fees.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:08:36
Altcoin created from bitcoin won't replace orginal chain. We need to enable SegWit for Bitcoin without chain split. Bitcoin will done if chain splits to 2 or 3 Bitcoins...
No one wants to be bad guy who hard forks, believe me... Don't be fooled to encourage users to do HF; that's what Jihan and so called "Big Blockers" want, so that they can take over the orginal chain and enable SegWit and whatever upgrades they want. This is not about the SegWit or block size increase. This is power grab.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:28:42
I agree with this. Fees are way too high and Jihan is more than happy to milk them from us.

I see Bitcoin and Litecoin to be just software. Bitcoin has first mover advantage and network effects + it's only crypto currency that has correct philosophy behind it. But for me Litecoin is just copy... not a scam. Ethereum for me is grand scam; it's premined and it destroyed its own principles by doing bailout HF. I don't like it's centrally governed. I hate that scamcoin. For me it's fraudulent blockchain that is used as a scamming framework to launch bogus tokens.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:28:28

Localbitcoins is always good choice, also check out if your city has bitcoin atm at  -- good option to use cash and maintain privacy.
Bitcoin core is full node implementation and while it's good to run your own validating node I suggest you to use mobile wallet (like Airbitz or Breadwallet) to get familiar with bitcoin.

As banks in Croatia don't offer any BTC accounts (as far as I know) I assume you want to sell your BTC and transfer fiat money to your bank account. I don't know about tax laws in your country, but you could always sell your coins for cash for privacy reasons. When you have a privacy taxes are optional for you.
