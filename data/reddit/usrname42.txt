All of those are due to political idiocy, not any actual economic issues. That's the shared root cause.

If non fiat-based systems are so great, why does no country today use one? Doesn't that mean all non fiat-based systems eventually collapse? And why do [basically no economists](  think a return to the gold standard would be good?

If we're going to appeal to authority, academic economists who have actually published economic research have a much greater understanding of economics and fiscal policy (btw inflation is mostly affected by monetary policy) than Lew Rockwell, and most of them don't think the system is going to collapse.

Which is why the argument above is stupid.

Call it a political platform if you like, but there was no *economic* constraint on US debt that made 2013 some kind of cutoff year beyond which debt cannot safely increase. If actual investors thought the US government had an unsafe level of debt, interest rates on US bonds would be increasing - in fact, they're near record lows. An actual debt crisis would look like Greece.

I'm not arguing that there aren't risks to global prosperity and stability, but I am arguing that a) US government debt levels are not one of those threats, b) in the event of anything going wrong with the system, Bitcoin and Bitcoin users will not significantly benefit, and c) people in positions of power are self-interested enough to try to avoid the system collapsing by using redistributive measures to solve some of these problems, if they become more acute.

[If that were the case, then an independent price index would show very different inflation rates to CPI, right?](
What evidence do you have for the claim that unemployment is over 10%?

Exactly. You can't live in a Bitcoin. It has much less intrinsic value than a house.

Except that when they convert to fiat currency, they have to pay a processing fee. Am I missing something here?
