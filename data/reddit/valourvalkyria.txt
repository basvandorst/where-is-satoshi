Rudimental researches show that CME futures are quarterly?

Look for localbitcoins.
For exchanges, while I hate coinbase, it's the most user friendly. (Remember to buy your bitcoins in GDAX instead of coinbase itself)
bittylicious is the fastest, with the shittiest price.

Price going up every single minute. I suspect it's because of the launch of CBOE futures.
If you hold fiat in any exchanges, BUY NOW.
I think it will touch 17000 again today.
To the moon!

If you paid your coffee in another currency that has risen 10% 6 months later, would you say 
“Congrats on paying 1.1x the price for your coffee as compared to everyone else”

Altcoin are not losers. At least that’s what I think.
They all have different features that bitcoin doesn’t have.
The fact that bitcoin hits 10k will further advertise the crypto community as a whole.
Some people might be into Litecoin, some Monero.
Those people are helping increasing the market cap of Crypto currency as a whole, which helps bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:39:17
I think it's different.
When it hits 8000, it's no different than 7000.
When it hits 7000, it's no different than 6000.
But this time we are adding another digit. 10k.
(At least in my pov.)

People don’t know that you can buy 0.1 btc instead of 1? I don’t know what to say...

Por que no los dos? ;)

Not sure if sharing your holdings online is a good idea.

You just made my day sir.

Very true, very true.
We really need LN and Atomic Swap.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:36:44
Whoa. 
Good information :)

This page is so simple that you can run it off a static page hosting like github page or S3 bucket.
Yet it's so damn useful.
It's like multisig.
Thank you for this app.

You could make a cryptocurrency out of that algorithm and earn money too!

Good strategy.

That might confuse them. And then there will be 20,000 bitcoins in the void, assuming I keep buying bitcoins until I die.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:53:07
make a puzzle out of it :)
my kids will hate me.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:37:15
Then I think we really have to make this happen. Isn't that what bitcoin is about?

Hmm probably better doing multiple long term storage i.e. Tape + CD + USB/NVMe + Hard Disk + paper with QR code.
Just to be extra safe that the storage medium doesn't deteriorate :)

So, if the multiverse theory is true, all the universes are mining on a giant blockchain?

Gotta hodl them all!
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:13:05
Basically, when you generate a wallet on bread(wallet) or electrum, it will prompt you to write down 12 randomly generated words.
In case you need to recover your wallet, you can use those 12 words. It's like a private key.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:45:28
I think that it's about 3,14 everywhere in the universe.
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:49:55
So uhh... what happened next?
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:07:38
It's more of a currency thing, not in maths.
It's not "wrong", there's no right and wrong in this situation.

Europeans use decimal points for separation.
$3.000,00 is three thousand and zero cents.

the only thing i give a shit on this post is that you are mining with renewable energy. good for you.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:06:52
That, too.
