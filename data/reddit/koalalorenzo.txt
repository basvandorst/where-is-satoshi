No, it is not a BitGo address.

I am Italian and I do approve this yummy message.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:06:10
but you can fake a degree :D

Or he should stop, wait 4 days and the mine like crazy for 2 weeks!
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:06:06
Not if you are mining and the competition is getting harder to get a block.
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:09:22
Yeah, I think it is really bad if it will happen for btc.
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:18:56
I think that was the point. Can't wait to see some easter egg :D
@_date: 2015-12-12 11:07:55
If it is not confirmed and it is removed from the mempool, you may resend it.
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:16:53
I am pretty sure that the Insurance will find a way to not "recover" your coins. In any case you can use Xapo Vault if you trust them and Xapo's insurance. I still prefer to have a TREZOR, with my own private key saved also in the trezor's backup paper and stored in a real vault. That's is for big number of BTC that I want to hold.

Finally my iPhone 6 has the proper native resolution!
@_date: 2015-12-27 15:21:56
or you can turn it on and off every difficulty adjustment to be sure that it stabilize without growing to your difficulty.
1st week: you mine with a lower difficulty
2nd week: the difficulty is adjusted, you stop mining
3rd week: the difficulty is adjusted (lower again) and you start mining again, repeating what you did in 1st week.

(I still don't understand why my comment has 0 upvotes, is it just because I have a fucking link?!? thanks bots).
**If you don't own your private key is really easy to loose them**. Sure, You can use your Xapo account for daily if you want, (I have linked my debit card, for example) but I strongly suggest you to use a paper wallet or TREZOR to save your private keys, to hold your coins in a safer place owned by only you!
@_date: 2015-12-20 09:14:47
If I remember well it is asking you to confirm, before the broadcast of the tx. There you will see the transaction fee there
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:10:20
Sure, in that case the TREZOR will use the Android phone as node to broadcast the transaction or download the blockchain info required (if using a SPV). Note: BreadWallet is on iPhone only for security reasons. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:17:01
I use both. BreadWallet for daily things, and TREZOR as vault (monthly things, sometimes I even forget that I have one)
BreadWallet is encrypting your masterprivate key and storing it in the iPhone using AES encryption. If your phone is not jailbroken, and upgraded to the latest version, you should be safe. I suggest to connect it to the internet only when you really need to make a transaction (broadcast) or just update the blockchain and the balance info (it's an SPV wallet, don't worry).
TREZOR is safer, but it is hard to use when you have "daily" transactions to do... You need a second PC/Mac to use it, and even if you are using Electrum or mytrezor.com, you need a trusted "third-party" node to broadcast your transactions and download information about the wallet balance. 
If you don't use bitcoin daily, like to buy things on the web, a pizza or use ATM, then the TREZOR is just OK for you. If you instead have a Daily need, but you still want to save in a safe place your wallet... [why not both]( :-)
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:21:01
Ok, Thanks! That's important to know. So the malware can still affect the Trezor, but you can verify that the transaction before. There should be a way to confirm the process of sending the transaction signed, after it is signed: In this way you check that it is signed correctly on GreenAddress. What do you think about that?
@_date: 2014-08-18 11:32:08
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:36:22
That’s amazing to know! I really like this App, and now that I know that the code is open source, I like it even more. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2014-08-23 09:58:10
I will! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:17:57
I retweeted it! This will be amazing :-)
@_date: 2014-08-22 09:36:52
By reading documents around internet I can understand how it works to verify the payment. Maybe I am just really ignorant about that and I am really curious :-) Thanks for your answer. What about when you have to send a payment? Is it going to send the “encripted” payment to some node that will spread around the bitcoin network? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 09:04:17
So... is using a paper address, the best solution?
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:13:16
You are saying that the "user interaction" using the screen and the buttons on the Trezor, are making the process safer than on that Chip. I agree, but what if I just plug and unplug the USB when I need, does it make any difference? Could it be something like: "Yes" = Plugged in? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 12:55:15
I think I am going to do so: generate a paper wallet offline, move some coins over there and import it to a new wallet when I need those coins. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:16:19
Check it here:  
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:56:35
Sure, for now I just have a README but I will probably write something about it ;-) 
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:15:58
ahahah thx!
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:18:02
I am considering it, for sure! I put all of them for diversity reasons, but I see your point! (check the branches). I hope somebody will find this useful as I do!
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:52:08
yes, let me explain. Remember what happened with Ethereum some times ago, when a version of the client went down because of a bug? The network was up and running because they have "diversity" in clients and versions. I do see this as important to keep the network up and running, also in Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2016-06-01 10:35:29
It is really easy, and you have just to create a shared wallet! You can use the Chrome version of Copay that supports natively the Trezor wallet, in this way you can create a multi-sig with iPhone, Mac and Trezor in few steps.
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:03:03
I don't think Apple will block you :-) if so, push for a change! :D
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:29:33
+1 hopefully they will release for iOS :D
@_date: 2015-08-12 05:06:28
Sorry, you are picking the single example that I provided, but you should probably consider the meaning of this thread.
I am trying to understand what Bitcoin learned from altcoins, and/or why not. I don't care if PoW is better than PoS or of a combination... I really don't care. :-)
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:21:54
There is a 2-way BTM also in Copenhagen with BTC/DKK. I used it few days ago, and it was kinda expensive. (I had not time to check the fees)
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:41:27
They don't actually respect your privacy: they have more information than your bank, and you can read online a lot of people with frozen funds. I don't trust them anymore :-(
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:31:37
My self, or greenaddress.it 
I have a TREZOR + GreenAddress to feel safe ;-)
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:50:50
Are you using myTrezor or another wallet/software? I don't trust Chrome to be honest!
@_date: 2015-08-12 04:47:04
But some of them may be helpful. I think for example that PoS over PoW may remove the 51% but create other problems. Nothing is perfect, but the altcoins are not just "monkeys"... maybe monkeys with one single feature super cool and something else horrible. :P
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:54:02
Thanks! I Will :-)
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:06:41
Is this true? Are they doing this?
I am not able to read that anywhere 
@_date: 2015-08-23 05:48:19
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:37:00
I do not recommend to say bad things to those cable... you know what happened to my friend that had a fight with a blue-rusted-cable-ghetto-gang? Don't you know?!? I don't see him around anymore! Don't say bad things to the blue ghetto cable!
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:29:11
I will replace it as the support suggested me, but my big question is: even if they will send it back to me again... they can do it again! So, what is the solution? Going to the factory, follow the building of my specific device and then pay it in person?
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:58:55
I actually watched that video (and several others) before deciding to buy it or not. Thanks for sharing that!!!
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:40:15
I had a two HW1, with GreenAddress but one stopped working, and the other was turning off my PC (Dell Mini) and Mac every time I was using it. I had to transfer my bitcoin and trash the HW1 after 6 months :( Then I bought a Trezor
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:45:18
One pizza at [hungry.dk]( and maybe I am going to regret it!
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:37:27
It was new and I bought it directly from the website! but the support asked me to send it back so they can send me a new one :-) Amazing
@_date: 2016-12-18 13:26:28
Not always, it depends on how the HD is implemented. Let me try to explain this easily: the most common "kind" that I have seen implemented, is the same that Electrum uses, so if you use the same seed in Electrum, Copay, Trezor or on the Ledger Nano, you will get the same addresses (and the same funds). Instead BreadWallet implements the generation of the addresses in a different way. So, yes, you can use it to generate and eventually move your funds somewhere, but not everywhere. 
Check ti here: 
@_date: 2016-09-19 06:09:48
Yes and no, the debate is quite hot and you can find a lot of info. But, you have to consider that the development of solutions to the problems is hot as well. For example the implementation of thin blocks and extreme thin blocks are interesting, to speedup this process... At the same time we have also off-chain transaction via LN and SegWit, that will make transaction faster (almost instant, since those are off-chain)
It's not just about block size, it is about how we want to make a better bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:28:52
Amazing, this is just amazing :)
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:25:22
!bitcoin is the old !btc basically. :(
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:48:26
That is cool!!! Can't wait!
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:24:48
When I was there I was not able to find the ATM... "It was broken and they were repairing it"... I had to keep my euros :(
@_date: 2015-09-07 09:09:47
That is better :D Thanks! I will google it 
@_date: 2015-09-06 18:26:53
This is Amazing :D Please make it real into a Firefox/Chrome  app/plugin :3
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:53:52
That is super cool! 
I think I will do that as present soon... and I will pay with Bitcoins! :D
@_date: 2016-10-29 15:39:48
same here, nothing weird ever happened. They actually are doing a good job to introduce and help new user to start using bitcoin! So far they are also doing a good job on the UX, which is really important if we want to allow everybody to use Bitcoin! Cheers for them!
Edit: I keep a small amount on Coinbase, the important stuff is on a Trezor... you never know!
@_date: 2016-10-22 06:49:56
That would be really cool!
@_date: 2016-10-04 05:22:19
Thank you Apple! ₿ :)
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:57:16
What is gold backed by?
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:10:54
Are you also planning to "alert" the users when a RBF transaction is incoming? That would be amazing!
Great job and thanks for improving this client every release!
@_date: 2015-11-08 22:07:59
...so the altcoins, duh? 
 
 
 
ban soon?

I was going to reply with an amazing "porco dio", but then I realised that she doesn't speak english if she replied me in Italian... Porco dio.
@_date: 2015-11-09 07:09:18
Copay is also a good one now :-)
@_date: 2015-10-04 09:45:48
I am using xapo one and I am happy with that. I don't have other debit cards so I am interested in other people opinion.
@_date: 2016-05-18 11:31:20
Thank you for your reply! I love the app and I use it mostly because it is one of the few that is truly decentralised! :-) Thanks for what you are doing!!!
@_date: 2015-10-26 13:08:21
I was using a TunnelBear VPN connection :O
@_date: 2016-05-01 05:57:30
I am confused, is t0 using a private blockchain? So only "authorised people" can be a node... and only "authorised" people can broadcast transactions? How secure is that? How trust-less is that? Why not just use kinda-Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other public blockchain that has multiple purposes?
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:53:37
I am scared of the "buy/sell" feature, for privacy reasons. I hope it will be possible to disable this as in Copay!
@_date: 2015-10-10 06:40:25
Meh... not really tested to be honest. I have deleted it instantly since there is no source code and I felt really "unsafe".
@_date: 2015-10-16 12:26:27
I will do my best.
@_date: 2016-05-22 05:37:18
Not really, if the malleability problem is fixed, and if the Bitcoin Client broadcasts only the first transaction seen, a normal transaction "replaced" is not a problem. Instead an RBF transaction, because of its nature, will be broadcasted anyway!
@_date: 2015-10-26 11:48:24
I see a butt... :O
@_date: 2015-10-09 12:25:47
On Mac you are not able to close it but force quit. I think it is dangerous somehow. I would like to see the source code
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:16:29
What? are you still using paypal? 
@_date: 2015-10-14 09:40:20
I would select it "every" 2.5 minutes, but I would like to have a "custom" value to change the refresh time to my own value.
PLZ, make it open source :3
@_date: 2015-10-14 07:47:22
I am going to install it :-) 
I was thinking about a watch face that shows the "bitcoin block number" instead of the hours :P
@_date: 2015-10-05 17:24:44
In Copenhagen we have 2 ATMs. One is just selling bitcoin and the other is both selling and buying. 
The one that is just selling is super simple to use: Scan, Verify the address, Insert money, Confirm. Done!
The other one, instead is super complex: I remember it was not working, and was requiring me to write my phone number, and verify it with a one-time-code... I don't want to associate a bitcoin address to my phone number. Anyway, with that machine I was not able to "insert the cash" because "the central hardware vendor" was doing an upgrade to their system, without notifying the users.
I had to log in on localbitcoins and find somebody. It was better and "cheaper" for my privacy. :(
@_date: 2016-05-30 19:35:58
I use it with a 2of3 multi-sig wallet with my Trezor + iPhone + Backup. Best solution ever so far!
@_date: 2015-10-18 13:51:32
@_date: 2016-07-18 18:11:42
IMHO Electrum is the best if you are not looking for a full node, but just a good wallet, or if you don't have enough space for the blockchain (even when limiting the space to 5GB of blocks)

@_date: 2016-07-24 21:27:11
They also provide a safe way to recover the funds if GreenAdress is not available anymore! 
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:56:00
"Ama retto" instead of "Amaretto"? Another example of how hard is for foreigners to write Italian... but it is funny that I have never noticed the meaning of the two words divided in Italian. Ama = he/she/it loves, retto = rectum
therefore, this must be the true HODL Special drink!
