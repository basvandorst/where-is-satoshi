You can check out our press release on the [donation]( but in short:
Increase innovation and the number of new projects in high priority areas of free software development, including the GNU Project; Expand the FSF's licensing, compliance, and hardware device certification programs; Bring the free software movement to new audiences; Contribute to the long-term stability of the organization.

You can deduct donations of [other non-currencies items]( what is the difference here?
EDIT: also, in this case you're bringing up, what exactly are your capital gains? You gave away the bitcoins so there's not really any gain to be taxed.

Very neat. One quick correction on your license page: the AGPL requires that someone who modifies the code provide to users interacting with that modified version an opportunity to receive the source. That's slightly different from having to 'publish' the source, as it means that local modifications that aren't put live don't need to be released.

Follow up on the deflationary thing, would it be possible for the community to decide to add more bitcoins in the future? People say that no more can be mined once the hard limit is reached because 'it is written in the code', but the software miners run gets updated pretty frequently from what I understand. Would it be possible (via a hard fork, I presume) to change the total number that can be mined, assuming a majority of the mining power agreed to the change?

If you use the standard kernel then perhaps so, since it comes with many binary blobs which could be housing anything, but there is [Linux-Libre]( which is blob-free.

It's not a good idea to assume that people will always act rationally with their own long term interests in mind. There's plenty of evidence that shows that individuals often act irrationally, and there's also the fact that people may have circumstances that cause them to discount possible future value more harshly than normal. A loner with a terminal disease might not have any reason not to cash out quickly and spend their last weeks in comfort. 
There is also the issue that the coins could  be stolen, and the hacking of Mt. Gox back in 2011 demonstrated that people are more than willing to dump coins down to zero if given the right circumstances. The fact that there are a few individuals who have the power to do so is a legitimate concern.

Even outside of law, words can have multiple, sometimes even contradictory, meanings. Different agencies enforce different areas of law that each have their own set of technical terms that are defined by that body of law. Sometimes those terms are confusingly similar to each other, and very often they are confusingly similar to words that have an ordinary meaning in English. You have to look at the law itself and see the definition in order to understand what is meant by the term in any given context.
It might be helpful to think about it as being like a function name in a program. You can sometimes guess what a function does by just looking at the name, but if you really want to understand it you'll have to actually look at the code. Different programs may use similar function names, but you can't assume that the function does the same thing in both programs just because the names are similar. Different bodies of law are like different programs, and if you want to understand what a term means in a particular law you'll have to look to that law (or possibly case law or legislative history) to find the proper definition.

That's not what I understood OP to mean, and you'll have to forgive me for thinking 'a whale' would be a single person. In any event, there are people who have enough coins to individually drown the markets (which are currently pretty shallow), so I don't think it would need to a coordinated event to cause problems.

What is the license? I didn't see any licensing information in the repo. Best practices is to put the license in a file called COPYING or LICENSE. If there's no license, then people don't have permission to modify, share, and redistribute the work.

Well you've got one good argument right here in this post: people who care deeply about software freedom aren't able to use Mycelium and there is a big overlap between that community and the Bitcoin community. I'm the copyright and licensing associate for the [Free Software Foundation]( and we've helped tons of projects and companies upgrade to a freedom respecting license. If you'd like back up in helping Mycelium to make the switch, please shoot us an email at licensing

This is a part of the tech life cycle laid out by [the Innovator's Dilemma]( a new tech doesn't serve the needs of current high margin businesses, but does meet the needs of certain niche groups. The tech continues to develop, funded by growing those under-served sectors, until it gets to the point where it starts to outperform the old tech even in those high-margin areas of business. It happened in steel factories and hard drives. Doesn't mean it always happens or that it will happen with Bitcoin, but it is interesting to think about.

Yeah, I'm not sure where this comes from exactly. People were hyped about the internet, especially by 1995. Lots of people at the time thought the internet would bring about a golden age of direct democracy and toppling of old power structures. Yeah, there were detractors; maybe I don't remember them as much since they were by their nature generally not on the internet. But this idea that everyone was against the internet back then seems like a bit of a rewrite of history.

Many of you here on r/bitcoin helped support the FSF receiving its largest ever donation, a million dollars worth of bitcoin from the Pineapple Fund. Now we want to help more free software projects receive funding as well, but we need your help again. We're gathering together this Friday during our weekly IRC meeting to work on improving the \[Free Software Directory\]\([ by tagging projects that accept cryptocurrency donations. You can help out by just dropping by and tagging your favorite free software projects, or you can join in the discussion about how to run this crypto\-donation project going forward. I hope to see you all there on Friday!

And searches for [Paypal]( are down over the same period! But let's be serious here, as several other people have pointed out, this rise is barely a blip when you look back over the year. It doesn't show any real exploding interest. It might actually be a pretty negative sign when you think about it. You'd think the CNN doc would have given rise to a lot of new (or renewed) interest in Bitcoin. But that doesn't really seem to be the case.

I hope when you say 'life savings' you are not including your emergency fund. An emergency fund of around 6 months of expenses should be kept in as liquid a state as possible, so that it can be used right away to deal with the unexpected. Not having a proper emergency fund can do major damage to you financially if you lose your job or have an accident. Just imagine how much it would suck to be forced to sell some of your coins during a temporary low in the market, only to watch the price go back up. In short, if you don't have an emergency fund, then you have an emergency.

A lot of people tend to focus on the technical aspect of bitcoin, but there are other factors that might make another currency "better". For most people, the technical merits behind the system make no difference at all. How many people honestly understand how credit cards or paypal work? Most people have no idea, and they don't care. What they do care about is seeing the logo for the company they use and trust. A latecomer could jump in with an identical service to bitcoin, better branding (perhaps an established brand like paypal or amazon), and simply trounce the bitcoin community. "Buy safecoins, they're just like bitcoins but backed by a name you can trust."

They don't have to offer anything new or desirable in order to succeed. Only a small percentage of people make decisions based on the technical merits of a thing. Most people don't even have the ability to discern the technical merits. For the rest, there is marketing, and already established banks obviously have an advantage in that regard.

It's crazy to think how small bitcoin still is. With all the big news and the rising price, it can seem like bitcoin is poised to take-over. But then you see something like this and are reminded that it is still a long ways to go before most people even know about bitcoin, let alone support it.

The network effect only favors bitcoin if you assume that the only competitors will be newcomers who have to build a network from the ground up. Something as stupid as Amazon privately mining their own blockchain and then offering it as simple payment method while providing associated tools through their store and hosting services could be a serious threat. Aside from perhaps being better at providing associated services, and making it easier for people to buy their coins, it could technically be the same. Once people have the coins, it actually would be pretty much identical to bitcoin.  But the fact that it is coming from a trusted network could be a huge advantage for adoption. You have to remember, after all, that many people make decisions based on advertising and gut feelings instead of on the technical merits of one choice or the other. 
People are talking about the potential for a bitcoin 'market cap' of a billion dollars, well, Amazon's market cap is a little bit higher than that (about [$120 Billion]( And they are not the only player of that size who could be interested in created a blockchain that has them controlling most of the coins at the start. So I wouldn't be so quick to assume that bitcoin really has insurmountable network advantages. 
EDIT: Apparently bitcoin just hit the billion dollar market cap.

It moderates itself but in unknown directions. Small communities can see their initial purpose mutated or destroyed when an influx of new people come (think endless september). The initial members can try to move to a new subreddit to re-create what was lost, but this isn't always successful. Having good moderation can help maintain the initial culture, forcing newcomers to acclimate or to form their own community elsewhere. Good moderation has the same counter-democratic effect as a constitution; yes, the majority is in some ways constrained about what they can do, but the constraint helps preserve the community.
None of this, of course, applies to bad moderation. However, if you already trust your current mod, he'll always have the power to remove other mods that are added after him.

To merchants. That is a great feature for merchants, but the reason that charge-back exists as it is now is because consumers want it. Having no charge-backs does not directly benefit the consumer as it shifts the risk of accidental transfer or being defrauded by a merchant to them. 
Indirectly, it can benefit them in the lower prices merchants could offer based on the merchant not having to bear the costs of charge-backs. Also, because of the distributed nature of bitcoins, consumers may find themselves becoming 'merchants' much more easily, in which case they would gain the benefit directly.

But .6% on one $266 transaction is less than .6% on ten $110 transactions. If the volume of transaction outweighs the loss in value they still make bank. And we have to keep in mind, the policy of allowing bots runs during non-panic times as well, so there are increased transactions when the price is going up as well. So it makes sense for them to allow micro-transactions. Now, if they were smart, they could keep the bots during normal times but block small transactions when the service is lagging.

Except the 'better' part to come out could be unrelated to the technology itself. Instead, the 'better' aspect could have to do with superior marketing/branding, customer service, or even potentially government backing. This new system could even just be bitcoin on a new blockchain but with better backing from people who know how to market and spread a new technology.
Bitcoin has first-mover advantages, but I don't think that those advantages are a lock on the future of crypto-currencies. Bitcoin won't just succeed on its own; it needs people working on building the services and companies around it that will lead to its adoption.
