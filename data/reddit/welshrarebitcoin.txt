I think the Tails issue is different. I'm a Tails user myself, and the Electrum client in Tails is often a few versions out of date and won't connect; I generally download the latest tar.gz and run it from there (it still picks up your wallets in persistence).
As for the Windows client, the only other thing I can think of is some kind of firewall issue preventing you from communicating correctly with the server... but I'm no expert on what could be going wrong there.

When you installed Electrum, did you set a particular server or allow it to automatically select one? It almost sounds like the server you're connecting to is not relaying up-to-date information.
If I was you, I would try downloading the portable version of Electrum, to ensure it isn't accessing any local config files, and restoring your wallet within that. It's available from the Electrum download page.

I'd like to suggest a UK charity, [RNLI - the Royal National Lifeboat Institution]( (link goes to their Bitcoin donation page).
I grew up in a seaside town in the south of England. Sea rescue in the UK is split between the sparse, but Government funded Coastguard, and the RNLI. There's a RNLI station in many coastal towns, fully manned by volunteers, and charitably funded (the 'Royal' in their title reflects royal patronage - it's definitely not an indication of funding).
Where there's an incident at sea, RNLI volunteers are often the first responders. I remember teachers at school dashing from classrooms because an emergency siren had gone off in the distance. Some of my friends had family in the fishing industry, and their parents and close relatives had been saved on numerous occasions by the efforts of these brave men and women.
It would be fantastic if their efforts could be recognised this Christmas.
Also, I think what you're doing is fantastic, and should go down in the annals of Bitcoin history. Anyone got links to the media to get this story out there?

One effect of the Lightning Network is that a significant proportion of transactions will be taken off-chain. Once that happens, transactions per block will decrease and fees will fall. This guy's assumption that fees will continue to increase following LN is shaky at best.
Describing Lightning Network transactions as IOUs is also rather misleading. The transactions are (or have a direct mapping to) standard Bitcoin transactions. Describing them as an IOU suggest someone could welch on the deal; this is false. Any non-time-locked transactions can be submitted to the blockchain as required.
Lastly, suggesting that Blockstream will be the main beneficiary of Lightning Network is somewhat incorrect. The three main Lightning Network implementations are open source. A whole range of companies will establish themselves using this software, and I imagine some larger businesses will implement it themselves (e.g. exchanges, Amazon). Specialist hardware - not sure what he's going on about here. I would imagine any hardware requirements would be less demanding than running a full node on a busy big block network.

This won't happen, as the relevant tax is already in place. It's called capital gains tax. Whenever you convert bitcoin into £s, goods, or services, you should be paying it (via a self-assessment tax return). You can also make voluntary national insurance contributions if you're not working.

I'm a big fan of [Tails]( It's a highly secure Linux distro which runs from a usb. It comes with Electrum.
Tails, by default, stores no data, in which case you would have to type in your private key words each boot. A better option is to tell it to store data for Electrum, which is kept in encrypted persistent storage - you would then have to just type in your encryption key on boot. Connections to the net are through the Tor network.
Personally, I consider this to be as secure as a hardware wallet. In some ways, it may be better, since it runs off any old usb - no one would identify it as holding bitcoin, requires a cold boot to access, and has strong data encryption.

The CME futures will be cash settled; no bitcoin will be exchanged. They're basically a monetary bet on the future price of bitcoin.
Of course, some people who enter into a futures contract will do so to hedge against the value of actual bitcoin they own. This is where the worry around shorting bitcoin via futures arises.
However, once the futures market gains sufficient momentum, genuine futures traders will get in on the game, and will buy / trade futures contracts without ever owning bitcoin. They will trade futures contracts in order to hedge against other futures contracts they hold.
In either case, the settlement of the contracts will be through USD.
And, frankly, it's the type of situation which is indicative of how deranged the financial sector has become; it's a betting shop with nicer suits.

Decentralisation isn't what you think it is.
Decentralisation ensures no one person or organisation can manipulate the blockchain or Bitcoin protocol. That's the intrinsic benefit of decentralisation - it's nothing to do with exchange rates between bitcoin and other currencies.
Exchange rates are susceptible to human manipulation. There's little we can do about this at the moment, as the Bitcoin economy is very much in its infancy.
Currently, the biggest influence on the value of bitcoin comes from the exchanges. This is because we're still in a market whether most movement of bitcoin comes from investors buying in or cashing out. Since almost everyone else is hodling, there is a limited amount of bitcoin available to move around, and so price changes get magnified quickly.
I hope, with time, two things will happen.
1. Second-layer solutions will make wide-scale commercial use of bitcoin viable. Once this happens on a large scale, the value of bitcoin will become more tied to the value of real-world goods and services.
2. The market for investment in bitcoin through exchanges with fiat will become less profitable. Achieving (1) will help with this; I also suspect that the markets will establish a natural limit on the exchange value of bitcoin which will reduce the profitability of trading activity. The deflationary nature of bitcoin should help with this, probably only after the next halving.
In any case, until either or both conditions are achieved, I would expect to see exchange values continue to fluctuate. But this does not impact the value in decentralisation - Bitcoin's worth is in the blockchain, and as long as that remains secure, I will continue to support it.

Imagine if Stephen King and Donald Trump were writing a book together. They get to chapter 20, mainly because King pretty much steers the narrative, style, and prose.
At chapter 20, Trump decides he can do better by himself. He takes chapters 1 to 20, and starts chapter 21 using a non-toxic crayon and the writing skills of a 5 year old.
Stephen King also continues the book.
A Bitcoin fork is like that. Prior to the fork, the code and blockchain of both versions are identical. After the fork, they diverge wildly.
Returning to the example, Trump can probably throw lots of money at his book to make it a flash-in-the-pan success. People have used, and will again use this approach with their forks of Bitcoin.
However, 20 years down the line, King's version will be the classic that people still read.

I find it hard to visualise how bitcoin will grow in the future, and how much hodling will contribute to my future purchasing power.
I made a little website that does some modelling based on some of your assumptions about bitcoin's future. It then works out a yearly spend allowance which will give you a consistent purchasing power in the future.
Needless to say, it's not a crystal ball! But I hope it will help you visualise how bitcoin could potentially grow.

No, as  said above, I got it wrong; Bitmain will be mining blocks incompatible with either bitcoin chain. This will mean an immediate hard fork and effectively a new coin.
If I *had* been correct, and they were to privately mine the legacy chain with compatible blocks, and their private chain was longer than the public chain, then yes, upon release, it would be the longest chain. Nodes would see it as such, and adopt it as *the* legacy chain. Any work done on the previous chain would be rendered null and void, including any fees or payouts to other miners.
Of course, bitmain could only do this in limited circumstances, when their private chain hashpower exceeded 51% of the public legacy chain hashpower. I suspect these circumstances may arise following BIP148. It would be a huge leverage against any remaining legacy chain miners not aligned to bitmain.
However, as points out, this isn't what they plan to do. By hard forking, they're announcing their intention to create a new coin (they'll probably try, and fail, to retain the bitcoin name). Hopefully their decision to do this will be the impetuous needed to lead other miners to signalling segwit.

Fiat currency is the next Titanic, Bitcoin the lifeboats. When the ship starts sinking, Captain Fiat tells passengers, "There is no cause for alarm. This is the greatest ship ever built. The lifeboats are small, and leaky. You're more likely to drown in one of them than by remaining here."
His instructions work, mostly. Many passengers neither see nor want to see the gaping hole in the side of a ship. A few do, though. They see the hole, and they see the cold waters, and they choose to take a seat in a lifeboat, just in case.
A few more people join them. The Captain laughs as the first few boats launch. He watches the boats splash into the water, thinking about the evacuees' impending doom with a grim kind of pleasure.
Bitcoin lifeboats are magic though. The longer you stay in one, the more luxurious it gets. People who get on one early can look forward to living on their own floating island in a few years' time. They will neither need nor want rescuing.
Passengers still on board watch the boats, and watch them grow. Land forms around them, but still they remain on the ship. Surely they can wait a bit before leaving security for this strange new land.
Passengers who wait a bit longer for a boat needn't worry. The archipelago of richness built around the first survivors has sufficient fractionality to produce a flotilla of lifeboats for those left on the sinking ship. More people leave, and the new Titanic grows increasingly empty as the waters get nearer.
And, as the ship finally bubbles beneath the waves, Captain Fiat will look out upon the new continent formed around him. At that point, he will understand stability.
But it will be too late.

Hi guys, long time lurker, first time poster.
I wanted know know whether I'd be able to retire off my bitcoin, and created a little spreadsheet (Excel 2016) modelling tool.
The tool works on a few assumptions:
1. You'll start spending your bitcoin *x* years in the future.
2. You want to have the same purchasing power per year.
3. You want to spend all your bitcoin by the time you die.
The tool asks you for some predictions around bitcoin growth, and uses this to model the future purchasing power of bitcoin. It also asks you how much bitcoin you have, how long you plan to live, and when you want to start spending.
From this, it calculates the maximum 'salary' per year, you can draw from your bitcoin stash, presenting it in today's fiat equivalent.
Turns out, I can think about retiring in 10 years. Yay!
Obvious disclaimers: this is a very basic model, the outputs will depend on your inputs, which are inherently finger-in-the-air guesses at future bitcoin performance. Don't make any decisions based on this, and always err on the side of caution. And never get involved in a land war in Asia.
Enjoy! (Also, feel free to modify this to suit your own needs).

Does this mean that Bitmain plan a hostile takeover of the legacy chain?
1. By August, a good proportion of miners move over to the BIP148 chain.
2. Bitmain privately mine the legacy chain, anticipating that their chain will be(come) longest due to their mining power + ASICBOOST + ongoing transition by other miners to the BIP148 chain.
3. At an appropriate juncture, Bitmain announce their intention to release their private chain, threatening to wipe out all gains by miners on the public legacy chain.
4. Affected miners are given a choice - join Bitmain, and their intention to hardfork, in return, maybe, receiving some recompense from Bitmain for their losses; or suffer the losses and possible bankruptcy.
5. Bitmain control the legacy chain and hardfork.
