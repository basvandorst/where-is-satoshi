You should probably refrain from using words you don't understand.

Can't tell if you are really asking me this...are people on reddit really THIS dumb!?

I can use gold coins to buy anything as gold is a widely traded commodity with good liquidity supported by major banks and institutions. Almost nobody accepts bitcoins in the world and it's volatile as fuck.

Congratulations. You are almost through the letter A. If you keep this up we can finish all the letters soon and your mom will be so proud!

I mean ya I really am very smart. You do realize there are people who are superior to you right? No matter how salty and bitter you are about it. No matter how many of your idiot friends are part of your anti intellectual mutual masturbation session you are still an idiot. I'd like to think that even an idiot would on some level understand this, but it appears I've overestimated some people's intellect recently.

Why are you explaining how currency works to me? I'm not one of the morons who thinks this thing will never crash because it's a miracle and how everything else is shit and fake blah blah blah. I am telling people right now: when this thing crashes and it will, there will be people who will kill themselves. Probably a few from this sub.
Also, "better" than gold coins? Better in what way? Better short term returns? Because gold has been used for millenia, by multiple cultures, whereas bitcoin has been around for less than monopoly money and is barely accepted for anything anywhere.

It's not you, it's the world that's wrong.

You missed the part where gold coins have far more pros than Bitcoin and far fewer cons.

Don't argue with these morons. Reality will hit them hard soon enough. I expect a few suicides.
