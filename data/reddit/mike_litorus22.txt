But still, does that rule out a con from the start? How can you know for sure?

This is a good link I haven't seen before. Thanks

But what if they want to scoop all the little people and their investments? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:45:50
Again, you cant disprove what I'm saying. Trust me guys, I want to believe in this new technology and I hope it works. But there is a risk involved and im asking a simple question. Everyone on this subreddit is either massively invested in bitcoin and or complelty biased, or both. Im only being downvoted and provided with answers that do not shoot my question down. I want to understand but I cant wrap my head around it. And I feel like im not the only one.

Yes, Its smells like bank. I'm asking a valid question here.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:50:15
Yeah until they pull the fucking plug and shut you and your cash supply out after you "break a rule." This could be 1984 on steroids. We all know that soon the govenments will want to have all of us register our wallets. It just seems like a perfect storm of mass control.

No one can give me a straight to the point answer. And thats concerning. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:19:01
No one can disprove what I'm saying! Follow the money!
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:09:56
its an honest question? why can't someone just explain reasonably? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:35:05
Ok, what am I missing?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:08:58
yeah, me and like 90% of the other people talking about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:15:47
Excellent question. I'm sure there must be a way.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:24:16
But what if Satoshi is the CIA?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:52:37
Then provide a simple answer to prove me wrong. No one here can, because most of the people looking at this have no clue about finance or the economy, including myself. I'm just a laymen asking a simple question. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:20:24
we can only hope
