Hmm...good point. Perhaps evangelizing isn't the best way to go about things. I ask though, because we got into an argument the other day and I realized I should have more knowledge about what things make Bitcoin something here to stay.

Holy moly.

I see what you mean. I have no clue what all Circle is going to provide besides wallets for consumers. I'm guessing their next move would be to expand to include wallet and payment services for businesses? It would make sense to me at least that they grow to include both sides of the transacting equation...

I think its 1500 per course. Each course is 10 ECTS (credits?)...I'm looking at this: 
Looks like they want you to take 90 ECTS total, minus the 1 free course, so 8*1,500 = 12,000 Euro total.

I'm guessing the usual benefits of cryptocurrency. No chargebacks, faster transaction times, that sort of thing...and probably the ability to not have to carry a wallet with you (just transact using a smartphone and QR codes?)

It seems to me that their selling point is not the use of Bitcoin. They give you the advantages of the bitcoin network, but users just transact in USD like normal.

...you've got 12 .edu email accounts?

Ah understood. I'll have to make sure to block time off to learn this stuff. Learning difficult concepts is always fun. I recently finished my physics BS degree so I am familiar with 'difficult' for sure. Thanks for the approximate study times though.
Guess I better get cracking at this.

Oh I'm not disagreeing with that. He is right. As a note, the argument came up when I was talking to him about potential business ideas and I suggested we take a look at doing something with cryptocurrencies. I understand that there's currently a working system, but I definitely feel like over the next few years crypto will push further into the mainstream space. 
To me, this is a very attractive tech space to get into and learn about. I think it's very worthwhile to think about starting a business in the crypto space, especially with all the potential for building applications on top of the bitcoin network.
I am not politically motivated like others as you have pointed out. I think if bitcoin is going to survive and be useful, it has to move away from political ideology. My two cents. :)
Thanks for your response!

Probably the most sound response yet. Thank you.

Estimated daily or weekly time commitment?
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:06:02
Interesting. Thanks for the input. Why do you like the fact that its so 'hipster'?
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:49:28
Sigh... This makes me sad...
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:49:23
Yeah for sure. I signed up. Excited to see what they have to offer.
Today is a good day! I set up a recurring buy last night on Coinbase. :D
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:24:24
Well, I just thought I'd slowly amass some coin by doing a weekly recurring buy of $20. I have no clue whether or not it's a good time to do a recurring buy, but from my daily visits to coinmarketcap I've seen a pretty steady value (~420-~450?) for a while now. I decided to set up the recurring buy because I don't think it'll drop anymore than this. 
I have literally zero clue about your second question though. I don't have any trading or stock or w/e graph reading experience. I would say in the long run I think it's bullish. Like many I purchase to hold some and trade some, but honestly, you're talking to someone who's only been in this crypto world for ~6 months.
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:36:32
Also done!
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:52:08
Totally agreed. Not sure if I've ever seen BTC charitability... =__=
