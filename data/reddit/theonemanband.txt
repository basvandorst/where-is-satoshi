Hi, thank you for your honest answer. I didn't know about mining pools!
I don't have very clear the "no progress" part.
Let's imagine the dice has 1million faces.
You have to roll it 1 million times to get the right face?
Can the same face come out twice?
I imagine you need a lot of CPU/GPU to throw the dice once.
So maybe I can throw it like 10 times in one hour, and you with a better computer you can throw it 1000.
But my question is. If I use a very shitty computer, and I can only throw 1 time per hour. Will my 1 roll be usefull to the community?
just in minor part maybe?
What if i have 1 million people with shitty computers like mine? will they make the block break? I guess they will only get cents afterwards but this is for the sake of theory. :)

But do you think you could *potentially* mine with any computer?
mid 2008 imac, 2009 toshiba laptop, 2001 pc?
Or it has to be at least something? I don't care if it does 0.0000001% of the work, as long as it does something.
Also, will the computer get extremely slow? like, you can't use it at all? Can you still go on facebook/youtube/play chess/watch an .avi or .mp4? 
Can you say "only use 90% of cpu, and leave me the rest to watch a movie" ?

Thank you, I am a bit of a rookie, but I am trying to understand how it works.
For example, I know you need a powerfull pc to mine.
But my question is. Can many weak computers make 1 strong computer, when mining?
Let's say you have 10 million people mining for 2 hours using old iMacs from 2010. Would they make a difference?
Or would that be completely useless?
I know that even IF they break the code it gonna be only cents for them, but let's just forget about payment for a second. :)
