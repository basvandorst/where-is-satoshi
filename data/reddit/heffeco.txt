I was actually wondering about this earlier and how nowadays economic teachers are approaching Crypto, and whether or not they get any pushback from the school systems. Nice to see this post while browsing today and seems like an awesome professor! Thanks for sharing!

This sounds like it would be some really good fun. My cousin is just getting into the crypto scene and has been trying to develop his passion of photo and film on social media platforms. If you’re interested I could give you his contact. Maybe a cool little project. Great to hear your investment panned out and you are doing well, cheers!

All they would have to do is print a billion dollars and dump it into bitcoin. Bitcoin would become theirs and we would pay for it through taxes.
