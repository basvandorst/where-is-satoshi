No6. You want bitcoins to create a sales team so that bitcoins will rise in price again, so that you can continue hodling

Someone donated 0.3bitcoins to our organisation when the price was 18,103 dollars and I converted it recently to naira when the price was 13,700 dollars. So I can say I lost 1,320 dollars (448,000 naira approx).

Are you asking us how much bitcoins we have lost due to slowly falling price (for hodlers), or how much lost due to wrong trading?

No1. Bitcoin doesn't need a sale team because it is the most popular crypto currency there is.
 No2. What Bitcoin needs are people to increase its public image right now.
No3. The main reason bitcoins was invented has been defeated due to high transaction fees. It was invented for easier transactions.
No4. Right now Bitcoin only appeals to hodlers as it is the most costly commodity on ground. Bitcoin must go from a commodity to a currency back again.
No5. We should find a way to make Bitcoin better.

It is possible. A super computer can do it, if given enough time.

The rising price is such a good thing in its entirety. In Feb 2015 someone donated 4.23 bitcoins to my organization for charity work. That time a Bitcoin was 300 USD so I didn't bother withdrawing it in naira as I felt it was small (and the price of Bitcoin that month was falling). I withdrew all of it Dec last year when it was 10000 dollars. The work I could be able to do with that 4.23 bitcoins in Nigeria was so much that I even donated to another charity organization. Since the bitcoins was money donated for charity, o cannot use it for my personal gain. So you can see that bitcoins rising price is a good thing. 
Bitcoins will still rise like always.
