That is reeeeeaaaaaally shady.
Alright, yeah. You're right. If the evad3rs weren't so sketch and actually respected its users.... But damn.
Apparently this was patched but I wouldn't put it past them to put in another backdoor like this.
This sucks :(

This is the one of the most common misconceptions about mobile security. Darwin + OSX is one of the most stable and secure operating systems on the market, more secure than Android. Furthermore, most jailbreaks actually fix the exploits they use, so in some cases a jailbroken iPhone is *SAFER* than a non-jailbroken one. 
Seriously, it takes, like 6 months for *thousands* of experts to get a working exploit on iOS. For most Android phones it takes about a dozen hobbyists and a few weeks. It doesn't even compare.
I imagine that you got your opinion from people who did not change their remote login passwords from the default 'alpine' to something else, which is completely their fault. If you jailbreak your phone, and only install the blockchain.info app, you are completely safe.

Even if they do, nobody will do shit. The U.S. is too big of a military power for the dollar to collapse like these doomsdayers say.

Because has been a circlejerk ever since that bubble in March.
