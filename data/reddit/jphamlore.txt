Okay, let's make an analogy to 20 years ago.  Suppose someone had noted personal computers connected to the Internet would become widely available and that CPU power, storage space, and bandwidth available to these machines would vastly increase over the next two decades.
The equivalent to 21.co would be claiming that if one could get each of these machines to donate just a fraction of their CPU, disk space, and bandwidth, one could form a distributed computing machine of a scale never seen before that would put all of the world's servers out of business.  Welcome to the new "permission-less" super distributed computer that will take over the world!

Justice was served when the geniuses at Classic decided to drink their own kool-aid and listed Peter R as one of their developers, immediately announcing their project was going to be failure on the order of the Titanic.  Their prime task was to convince the miners their developers could actually manage a project on the scale of Bitcoin, so they prominently display as one of their developers the name of a clown?!
It is actions like this which lead to me to believe all of these alternate forks are actually deliberately trolling.  They're not even trying.

take one year or more to be adopted. We should increase the limit and
increase it now. 20MB is simply too big and too risky, sometimes we
need compromise and push things forward. I agree with any solution
lower than 10MB in its first two years.

The real crisis is that if some compromise isn't found and if the fork of Bitcoin-XT is required to force the change, then in effect, the core developers of Bitcoin Core who opposed the change will have been fired from the project.  Who could ever trust their technical judgment again if they were so blind as to permit a situation that endangered what they were supposed to be protecting.  And how could developers who were willing to be on the wrong side of a hard fork be ever trusted to have a commit bit on Bitcoin-Xt?
But what happens the day after?  Does Bitcoin-Xt just try to use new commits to the former Bitcoin Core, always checking that none of them try to reverse the new blocksize limits?  Would Bitcoin-Xt always have to vet its committers to make sure none of them is a mole from the former camp?
Once this war starts, I do not see how either side can back down from viewing the other as deliberately trying to kill Bitcoin, and I do not see a reconciliation.

What Gavin is doing is simply madness.  Was it not so long ago that this was done?
Gavin didn't want to be the lead developer of Bitcoin Core anymore:  He wanted to be instead the chief scientist.  So Wladimir was appointed to relieve Gavin of these duties.  And Wladimir is respected enough to be included with Gavin in the group to be funded by MIT Digital Currency Initiative:
Is it too much to ask as a bare minimum for Gavin to be able to convince Wladimir of the technical merit of Gavin's arguments?  Because after this is all over, assuming the Bitcoin-Xt fork is triumphant, what then?  Gavin will no doubt once again wish to ride off into the sunset to be more a chief scientist, and the natural to be the lead developer for Bitcoin-Xt is Wladimir.
I don't think one can reasonably accuse Wladimir of being a stooge for Blockchain.  But read his opinion for being weakly opposed to Gavin's proposal:




So why stick with the name Bitcoin-Xt?  Why not set up in advance Bitcoin-A, Bitcoin-B, Bitcoin-C, etc. so that every couple of years Gavin can hard fork the project, only to hand the project back to Wladimir, only to come back again to hard fork when he doesn't trust Wladimir's technical judgment, and so on.

Does anyone listen anymore?  A miner posted asking for a max of 10 MB for technical reasons, so here's the proposal which starts at 8 MB and doubles every 2 years?!  Is this some deliberate attempt to kill consensus?
At the maximum it should have started at 4MB with a linear increase, say 1MB per year.  Then the increase would be far more gradual and it would take 6 more years to hit 10MB, basically double the current lifespan of Bitcoin.

Read Counterparty's open letter critically:
I contend part of the problem with this debate is Counterparty's disrespectful open letter.  Let us learn about true communication from why this open letter is disrespectful and contemptuous and therefore is causing the damage.
Bitcoin protocol's core developers have made a technical argument why the 40 limit is better than 80.  They are arguing in network engineering terms and deserve to be answered in a similar manner.  Counterparty in their open letter does not address these engineering objections at all merely claiming that if there is a problem, change the compensation.  This is disrespectful and condescending, especially when it is the Bitcoin protocol core developers who are the ones making the decisions.
Furthermore Counterparty does not address the proposed alternative of using the 40 bytes as a hash, instead simply stating if they don't get their way, they will abuse another part of the protocol.  Again, this is disrespectful and contemptuous of the technical competency of the Bitcoin protocol's core developers, who deserve at least an answer to their objections.
In true communication, each party deserves to at least have their arguments understood and considered.  To pretend that the other side's arguments simply don't exist is to destroy true communication.

No one has given Gavin Andresen the type of authority over the project that Linus Torvalds has over Linux, by design.  
The bigger decision it seems to me is whether there will be a formal voting system.  I suspect if one isn't created, a hard fork will be politically impossible.  That is why in more formal voting systems there are clear rules about how to submit a proposal to qualify for a vote, who is eligible to vote, and what consensus level is required for a proposal to pass.

What if the status quo wins the vote?  How long is this decision to be respected, one year, more, forever?  What if a larger block wins, should the other side be allowed a re-vote after some time?

Unbelievable.  If Brian Armstrong wasn't a co-founder, I think he would be in danger of losing his job as CEO within a week.  
This last week's claim is that Coinbase's future is more exchange than wallet.  In the last 24 hours, Coinbase's reputation as an exchange may have been permanently damaged.  They just tried to rip off their own customers selling 10% of the value of their coins.
Take the price charts from say here
checking the boxes for the exchanges' prices and see what Coinbase just failed to do, with OKCoin leading the charge to slap them down.   Just like I have been predicting in another sub two days ago, for which I was heavily downvoted, the Chinese are going to show Coinbase who really wears the pants in this industry.
Now I'm not one of those claiming Bitcoin's price is going to hit $10000 or even $1000 USD any time soon.  But it is pretty clear there was a steady price of around $420 USD before Coinbase decided to go cowboy and try to impose a 10% haircut on its own customers.

Another problem is that some of the key developers of Bitcoin Classic have argued that SegWit should be a hard fork and not a soft fork.  My understanding is there would be rearrangement of data structures and perhaps new transaction types.  Thus it would not be a simple pull and rebase from Core.
I believe there is also considerable resistance among certain Bitcoin Classic supporters to the idea of SegWit.  That is why I have predicted that if somehow Bitcoin Classic were to succeed in imposing an immediate 2MB increase, that community would almost instantly break apart in civil war over SegWit, especially with this bizarre governance structure claiming to offer democractic voting.

I think you have completely failed to understand what exactly Coinbase seems to think they bring to the table.  The need to obey KYC and other government regulations is not a bug relative to Coinbase, it's a **feature**.  It is what they do to make themselves relevant to the industry.  The article above basically states Coinbase chose being a **regulated exchange** over being a wallet as their core business.
If it were not the case that there are coins that are viewed as "dirty" versus being "clean" and thus people who use such coins being viewed as "possibly criminal," Coinbase would not exist as a viable business.  Therefore Coinbase absolutely needs the means to be able to distinguish between coins with a clean history and those that are dirty.  They need every transaction they themselves do not control inside their business therefore to be on the one true Bitcoin blockchain.
This to me explains why regardless of how large the market cap other altcoins achieve, Coinbase will **never** support converting them back and forth from fiat on their exchange, despite this being the best way to eventually pressure miners and Core to cave on the block size issue.

Satoshi has the financial means, Satoshi's hoard of bitcoin, the community support, and enough technical skill to be the lead developer of the equivalent of today's Bitcoin Core.  Satoshi walked away not wanting to do it anymore, giving Gavin Andresen the keys to the code repository.  Gavin Andresen has the financial means, being paid to work fulltime on Bitcoin, the community support, and the technical skill to be the lead developer of Bitcoin Core.  Gavin Andresen chose to step down handing this role to Wladimir van der Laan.
Lead developer of Bitcoin Core is evidently a position that has high requirements and is not entirely pleasant.  It is easy to see why:  A lead developer has to do so many things that are not coding.  Gavin Andresen would prefer to be the chief scientist and not the lead developer of Bitcoin.
I have been a vocal critic of alternate forks of Bitcoin Core intended for use by miners ever since late May precisely because I knew no one would step up to be a fulltime dedicated lead developer that one could depend on being there for 2+ years, and I was proven completely right.  Like I said at the time, even if Gavin Andresen had succeeded, he would have had no choice but to come crawling back to Wladimir a few months afterwards to hand back the position of lead developer because only Wladimir is willing, capable, and qualified to do the unrelenting and often boring work of being the lead developer.
None of the alternate forks meant for miners have any chance of succeeding until they can answer the question of who is going to be the lead developer who will be there day-in day-out for years.  Until they can, they are merely proposing what will inevitably become abandonware.  I also cannot believe they are unaware of how important this issue is.  Because without an answer, I am afraid that by definition alternate forks are trolling whose promotion can therefore be suitably banned on forums such as this:  They are non-serious acts meant only to provoke a reaction but which do not advocate an achievable outcome.

The concern is blindly using someone else's code and not having the resources to properly extend and maintain it.

You have the best reason to ban discussion of XT;  Mike Hearn has admitted that he is trolling with the entire issue.  
A discussion forum's purpose is to discuss a topic with people giving their reasons for their opinions.  Now if someone is saying something they do not actually believe in, whether they are a paid sockpuppet or they are trolling, they do not by definition belong in the discussion.   Moderators in that situation have the right and responsibility to remove such persons from the forum.   That is the whole point of moderation.
Hearn has stated in his podcast that his real goal is to replace the current multiple-person core developer model for Bitcoin with an absolute dictator with final say over decisions.  He said that if by chance the core developers eventually accepted XT's changes, it would be kicking the can down the road.
Listen to what Mike Hearn is saying after about 1:01, about an hour and a minute into the podcast.


Note that immediately after Hearn said that, even the interviewer was taken aback.
Then Hearn calls Wladimir accepting the blocksize increase as


What Hearn has been doing with the XT discussion is by definition trolling:  He is saying outrageous things that he does not believe in simply to stir up a reaction.
I conjecture Hearn's goal is to make the political climate for a blocksize increase impossible.  Thus his projection of major network problems that would give him the legitimacy in the future to demand a dictator to oversee Bitcoin core.

There was never a chance for XT to go anywhere once Mike Hearn said this after someone purporting to represent some of the Chinese miners posted airing some of their concerns:


of their internet situation, nobody has any inherent "right" to mine if
they can't do the job - if miners in China can't get the trivial amounts of
bandwidth required through their firewall and end up being outcompeted then
OK, too bad, we'll have to carry on without them.

I did source the comment.  Hearn stated the real issue was having a dictator over Bitcoin core, and that solving the blocksize problem would be simply 'kicking the can down the road."
By definition, Hearn is trolling.
Some of Hearn's actions can only be explained by making a deliberate attempt for the XT effort to fail.  XT needs the Chinese miners to have any chance to reach the 75% threshold.  So this is how Hearn talks to someone purportedly representing some of these miners on the Bitcoin development mailing list:


of their internet situation, nobody has any inherent "right" to mine if
they can't do the job - if miners in China can't get the trivial amounts of
bandwidth required through their firewall and end up being outcompeted then

Hearn just basically gave the people whose support he needed the finger in the most important public forum.  And from what little I know of those Eastern cultures, that is one of the most degrading and humiliating things one could do, something they never forget, or forgive.
It is almost as if there is a calculated effort to make XT fail to achieve its threshold.

Every day something happens to make XT look less and less like an actual software project.  Now there is code and even binaries for a fork of Bitcoin core that only contains the increase in blocksize, not the other patches in XT.  So what exactly does it mean for people to be running these new forks?  Are they for or against the 75% XT threshold?  Are both sides going to claim these forks' nodes in their calculation of support?
Everyone went off and threw out a Linux distribution years ago so what is the problem with this?  The difference is a Linux distribution is by its very nature something that intends to be a continuing project.  In contrast I see no development of any sort of continuing infrastructure to keep these forks updated.  What happens to these forks if there is a new release of Bitcoin core every few months?  It would be completely irresponsible to simply blindly fold in the new patches, after all, who knows if the patches might interfere with the pre-existing blocksize increase patches.  Someone running the forks needs to painstakingly go over these new patches.  That amount of work starts to add up to something suspiciously resembling the duties of a lead developer, a role whose drudgery neither Mike Hearn nor Gavin Andresen seem to have any inclination to fill.
From this circus I can draw no other conclusion that from the start XT was sabotaged from within in a deliberate attempt for it to fail.  This is especially inexplicable if the only template for a benevolent dictatorship, Linus Torvalds and Linux, is being applied only with all of its organizational lessons being reversed to induce deliberate failure.  Anyone have any idea for XT who are the equivalent of Torvalds' trusted lieutenants that enable him to continue being the lead for the project?

I couldn't be happier with this outcome.  Code for a hard fork only has to exist by July 2016; there's no guarantee it will be accepted.  A hard fork will probably occur no earlier than July 2017.  This means the development of the new fee market with 1MB block size will continue, and all the chicken littles who claim Bitcoin will be endangered will be proven wrong as price and adoption skyrockets, while the spam transactions are culled by the market.  The notion of a "Bitcoin Chief Scientist" will be destroyed forever as all of Gavin's warnings will prove to be false alarms.

The biggest reason I would have for Bitcoin supporters to not be worried in the slightest is that industry consortia have a **terrible** record of being able to produce a usable product from scratch, particularly anything related to software.  
For example time and again various consortia have tried to compete with Qualcomm in LTE or to create a mobile OS only to have no usable product actually appear.  So to this day Qualcomm dominates in LTE chipsets and single companies Google and Apple develop the major mobile OSes.  
The best software example of anything approaching a successful consortia is the Linux kernel, only that has been run from the start by a benevolent dictator Linus Torvalds who knows everything about that project and a lot more. 
But such industry consortia would **never** allow an actual coder to be the project's lead let alone be the benevolent dictator that creates the project from the ground up.  And that is why they will always fail, spectacularly.

It is surprising to me that people do not understand how total a victory Core achieved in the negotiations.  The victory is so overwhelming it might be advisable to consider showing some magnanimity.
First of all, **Core** did not commit, only some, admittedly important, individuals who described their titles as "Bitcoin Core contributors".  As Core operates by consensus and the group that went to Hong Kong, or any group for that matter, cannot speak for Core, there is no obligation for the code that is dropped in July 2016 to actually ever be incorporated in Core.
Meanwhile a great mass of the mining community has committed to a multi-stage process where it is understood that SegWit must be activated before any hard fork is activated.  Much of the community is now committed to as fast as possible accepting all of Core's releases from 0.12 on out in order to activate SegWit and eventually the hard fork.  (In particular the opt-in RBF changes will now be swiftly adopted.)  The process of activating SegWit has therefore been accelerated by many months or perhaps even made possible the crossing of the 95% threshold.
And once SegWit is activated, there will be up to 29 soft forks that can be deployed simultaneously, a gargantuan increase from the previous 1.  
So basically Core committed to nothing and got everything for expediting activation of its suggested improvements.
That being said, it might be wise not to adopt an overly legalistic interpretation if in a couple of years consensus develops to activate by hard fork an increase in the block size.

No, some in Core asserted that if fee pressure were an imminent prospect, there would be impetus to find solutions, **which is exactly what happened**.  Gavin with BIP 101 tried for the foreseeable future to destroy this process of fee pressure inspiring solutions.

Gavin was 100% wrong that there would be any negative effects from the blocks becoming full.  Instead, Bitcoin price has skyrocketed, almost doubling.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:33:34
Logically unless one thinks a fork is going to happen and it kills Bitcoin's price forever, the time to buy is now?  Because coins bought now will be valid on any chain in the future.

Don't worry about it, with all the promises walked back from the initial draft, all that needs to be done is to drop some code in July, have it be rejected as not having obtained consensus, and then with some luck any hard fork can be delayed until well into 2018 or later.
Also it can be interpreted that nothing is promised until SegWit is activated.  Once SegWit is activated won't there be the capacity to have up to 29 soft forks deployed simultaneously?  The pace of development using soft forks will skyrocket while the hard fork idea will be shown to be near impossible in the short term.
Meanwhile we'll have months if not years to see a real fee market develop.  When Bitcoin's price is seen to be still rising and no "brownout" disaster having occurred, all of those crying for a hard fork to increase block size will be seen to be fools or alarmists with an agenda.

What this graph shows is that by this July the halving of block reward won't be such a big deal relative to the miners because they'll already be collecting in transaction fees alone enough to match Bitcoin's price when it was below $240 USD, a figure at which apparently they could still mine at and stay afloat.
So I'm afraid ya'll out there hoping the halving will be some kind of miner apocalypse are gonna be mighty disappointed. :-)

To me the major legal exposure for supporting a fork would be to the larger American exchanges.  There have been threats that such a fork could be attacked by double-spending and rendered worthless.  And this is asymmetric in danger, because the 1MB branch coins could never lose their value.  An exchange backing a larger block fork that winds up on the losing side would be dead-to-rights guilty of outright fraud for selling fake coins.  I have argued no such American exchange will actually touch a contentious bigger block fork.
In addition the larger American exchanges are all-in dealing only with Bitcoin and fiat, not altcoins.  They don't actually have at the present working code for multiple cryptocurrencies.  So if any of them activate such code out of the blue to trade both branches of a fork and it goes wrong, there is another legal disaster that again could put that company out of business.

The big advantage of 2MB is that it has some chance of happening versus the other proposals.  
Even just one bump to 2MB and no others would be huge.  It would disprove the fears the developer community is so divided that a hard fork is impossible.  
What I see happening is the best case scenario where the limit won't be raised until Gavin Andresen's warned deadline of 5 months for negative effects will have long passed.  What is needed now is actual evidence as to what a future fee market will look like.  Now is the best time to find out.

From the article:


How about this simple challenge:  If Gavin Andresen can't even convince 2 of the 4 other developers with commit access to the github Bitcoin core repository, these 4 whom it appears Gavin Andresen accepted to have commit access in the first place, to support Gavin's position, maybe Gavin is simply wrong.  But it's even worse than that.  Not a single one of these 4 whom Gavin entrusted with this commit responsibility is willing to back Gavin's position in public.  And they aren't all working for Blockstream.  In fact the lead developer Wladimir van der Laan is part of the same MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative that Gavin Andresen is.

Gavin did it because he didn't want to do the boring grunt work of being the lead developer.  He wanted to be the chief scientist.
Everyone was perfectly fine with Wladimir being named the lead maintainer about a year ago.  And it's not like Wladmir did anything like secretly joining Blockstream.   In fact he joined the MIT Digital Currency initiative just like Gavin did.

You are on record for stating that an open source project such as Bitcoin core needs a lead developer who can unilaterally make decisions.  So why don't you tell us who you have in mind for Bitcoin XT's / core eventual lead developer, assuming your proposal wins.  It doesn't seem to be you or Gavin Andresen, because neither of you have shown any inclination to do the unending day-in day-out drudge work that a lead developer for Bitcoin core normally does.
But I know full well you won't name this person because you can't.  The truth is the best candidate for this would be Wladimir.
Until you name your lead developer, the person who can unilaterally make project direction decisions for Bitcoin core, you are just trolling the community, and should rightly be banned from Bitcoin moderated forums.

If the market really cared about an increase in the blocksize, it would have paid to support more core developers sympathetic to that view.
This is a classic case of money talks, BS walks.  The market has spoken.
The point of a market is that votes are weighted by depth of interest not just number of voters.  The depth of interest just isn't there to raise the blocksize.

@_date: 2015-09-19 04:44:12


The Hong Kong workshop is in December.  That is where concrete proposals will be discussed, so presumably no change before then.  Even if there were unanimous agreement on how to proceed, how rapidly would a blocksize increase be deployable after that?  
No matter what happens, I think we are going to go well past Gavin Andresen's 5 month deadline before we should see serious consequences to the network.  We will see, won't we?
Will the same apply to blocksize raise proponents if five months from now pass, there is no blocksize increase, and nothing bad happens?
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:16:15
That type of decentralization won't work because the dispute between the developers is over the protocol itself.
In this particular case of the debate over the blocksize limit, it wouldn't even help to have a formal specification and not just have the Bitcoin core code be the specification.
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:14:04
So who's the name?  Is it going to be you?
Enough of this weasel worded claim that someone should be unilaterally making decisions for Bitcoin core without stating who this person should be.  Who do you propose right now as the person in the world best suited to make these decisions, a person who would also be willing to take on the full-time drudge work of not just making sexy big decisions but also actively maintaining the project day-in day-out.

Who set up the current structure of Bitcoin core?  Gavin did, that's who:


So of the four other core committers that Gavin, he has been able to convince a grand total of **zero** to completely support his position in public.
And now with XT he has given control of the project to a person Mike Hearn who has stated in public a belief that open source projects should be run as a dictatorship by one person.  Uh, that person ain't Gavin, so it's pretty clear if some disagreement happens between Mike Hearn and Gavin in the future, guess who's getting the boot from the project?
This is sheer madness.  It can be debated whether people signed up for the current blocksize limit to be retained far into the future, but I really doubt anyone signed up years ago for complete control of the Bitcoin core source code to be in the hands of Mike Hearn.

I am afraid this is missing the entire point of Bitcoin:  Whoever possesses the keys **is** the owner.  If Kleiman had sole access to the keys to Satoshi's 1+ million coins then **by definition** he is Satoshi, instead of Craig Wright.
It should be obvious to everyone by now Craig Wright does not possess all the keys needed to access the 1+ million coin, else he would not be doing this public song-and-dance.  Therefore he is not Satoshi.

It is my impression at some point there are going to be several softforks required for say the Lightning Network and / or sidechains, so is the idea to try have them introduced in smaller pieces one-by-one, or can they be grouped in a couple of larger updates?

Those defending what Gavin Andresen and Jon Matonis have done, you just don't get the magnitude of what they did.  They have done the equivalent of someone opening the gates of a city in the middle of the night for an invader to gain entry.
My prediction is that is far from over.  What Craig Wright in my opinion has been doing is laying a trail to claim ownership of something essential to Bitcoin, whether it is a device on which he suspects are the keys of the actual Satoshi to the 1+ million coin, or to Bitcoin's code or protocol.  I think Craig Wright's not going away forever; instead, he's going to come back and start suing to try and deliver a tremendous blow to the community.
And what is most telling is neither Gavin Andresen nor Jon Matonis have apologized.  At some point what can be ascribed at best to gross negligence becomes liable for sanction by the community.  The supporters of Craig Wright's claims have crossed this line.

And who decided who has commit access to Bitcoin core?
Who decided who should be the Bitcoin Core Maintainer not much more than a year ago, April 2014?
Funny there seem to have been no notable objections in public to these appointments, because they were made based on merit, commit access being earned by making contributions to the project.
At least for once there isn't the false accusation of some conspiracy led by Blockstream because how would that explain Wladimir van der Laan's position?
