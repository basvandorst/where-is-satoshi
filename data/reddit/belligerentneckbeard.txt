Looks like the trolling is working as intended?

I'm looking to have fun and enjoy, not necessarily to maximize return, but I do understand your perspective.

Ya I understood what you meant.  :)  There's a fair number of less expensive S9s on Amazon, although they're much cheaper through bitman when/if they're available.
Agreed on the 220v.  If I ever buy another house I'll have an extra 220v line pulled for "stuff" like this.

I used to mine several years ago, and thought it was interesting.  I'm thinking of getting back into it, except this time I'm looking to buy some decent hardware.  Bang for the buck what is the current state of mining hardware assuming I'm not really looking to min/max the power thing?  I just want to mine because I like mining, and I pretty much always hold what I find.  Is the Antminer S9 still the best bet?
Context-  I don't have a huge ton of room, and have 110v power.  I'm only looking at getting one unit.  This is strictly hobby.

Ya I thought of that.  During the winter where I live is pretty cold.  Having a "heater" wouldn't be a sad thing.  During the summer we get some hot spells, and I don't have AC, but usually it's not for more than 3-4 days at a time.  After that it's 65f pretty much all summer.  I live next to the bay, so I get nice cool air off the water.

Ah cool, good to know about the S9s.  The 17 looks pricey, but the big problem there is power-  I only have 120v.

I'm in an apartment and don't want to eff with the high voltage power behind the stove.  If I was in a house that'd be different, I'd just have a 220v line pulled.
