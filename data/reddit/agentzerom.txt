Bitcoin is not divisible. All transactions recorded in the ledger/blockchain, including monetary inflation subsidies, are based on an integer value and atomic units of Satoshi. The clients by default display the amounts as a fraction of a made up denomination called "bitcoin" which is defined as 100 million satoshi.

There is no such thing as a fraction of a bitcoin. Everything is a satoshi and labels are attached to higher denominations such as "1 bitcoin equals 100,000,000 satoshi". But a transaction value is currently stored in an int_64_t variable which is an integer, NOT a decimal/fraction.

Intrinsic value is a **component** of something's total value. Bitcoin may not have any intrinsic value at all, but that doesn't mean they are worthless - it has other value by its other properties (like censorship proof, irreversibility, frictionles, etc). Additionally, I don't wear jewelry, therefore gold's "intrinsic value" as jewelry has no value to me. And I'm not a consumer of gold teeth, so there's that too.

Bitcoin eliminates the need to back things. Gold backed paper fiat because the paper was worthless, but the paper was more convenient (portable) so it gave it value through redemption.
Bitcoin is infinitely more portable/convenient than gold so there is no reason to back it - just port it around and use it.
Further, backing introduces counter party risk.

There are reasons to hold bitcoin beyond using it as a currency. For instance, why do people buy gold? As a hedge against other market risks (and other reasons).

Ft Knox has never been publicly audited. Germany wanted to repatriate their gold from WW2 and the USA said no thanks, we can't do that until 2020 or so. Germany wanted to immediately audit their own gold and we said "how about we give you X percent now and the rest later". Germany agreed but upon shipment, the gold was not the german-mint-stamped gold they deposited - it has been "melted down and restamped with another mint stamp". Then a few months later, Germany said (after some off-line threats were made, I'm sure) "Oh, nevermind, keep the gold USA, we trust you're doing a fine job securing it for us".

When using QR codes to transmit signed and unsigned transactions, you know exactly when your device is transmitting data and can do any number of things to capture the data it is displaying and independantly verify that the data is exactly what it should be (and not your private keys).

For you to understand what people are trying to tell you,  you really need to experience it personally. Bitcoin is very much like gold and I, as a life long gold bug, suspect you will like a portion of your wealth in it.  But for you to get to that place,  you need to get $5 of it and play around with it in all the manners possible (paper/brain wallets, multi sig, contracts, secret sharing, etc).  The worst that can happen is you will have spent $5 to make yourself smarter. Don't consider your experiment started until you have actually obtained your $5 in bitcoin. To be fair, there were many things you have to learn to buy your first one of gold to prevent you from getting ripped off that might taint your bitcoin experience.  But after that,  I promise you will have a different view of this math based asset.

A feedback loop in the protocol will regulate the block creation to an average 10 minute period, regardless of the hash power thrown at it.

The ability for an employer to compensate an employee with bitcoin has already achieved what you claimed will not happen in anyone's lifetime. That employer's ability to pay required taxes on behalf of the employee is already present in traditional accounting systems. Once the employer calculates and sets aside those funds to be paid to the IRS, all that's left to do is call the bitpay api to send them the appropriate amount of bitcoins based on the exchange rate. 
Even if the employees is paid in a bitcoin amount (ex: .5 btc/hr), it is standard practice to base their withholdings in the current dollar exchange rate for tax purposes.
I'd bet you a bitcoin at least one of bitpay employees is being paid in this manner. I

The difference is the elegance of using SHA256 as the PoW protocol. By using SHA256, we can trivially adjust the difficulty of the task at hand to control monetary inflation (and the rate at which blocks can be created). If you tried to apply that to finding protiens as PoW, you can't control block creation because there is no guarantee some network in the future couldn't solve protien problems infinitely faster - and what about the problem of agreeing on, or running out of protien problems for the network to solve.

That's what he wanted everyone to think (an my premise is that he did it to slow everyone's understanding of what Bitcoin really was and how it would work in a global economy). Look at the code.

Because it would me much less complex to add logic to the reward system that allows for additional monetary units to be created than it would be to change the entire transaction system by changing monetary units from integers to floats only to provide for divisibility. Changing transaction records to allow for a decimal would obliterate countless dependancies on systems that understand a satoshi as an integer. This will never happen. The protocol is far too entrenched for this type of change to be accepted.

If a single Satoshi has the same purchasing power of a USD penny right now, a whole bitcoin would cost 1 million USD. I think the point is that bitcoin COULD have this kind of valuation and still function as a global/ubiquitous currency. I don't think it will replace fiat in any of our lifetimes, but it (or some crypto currency like bitcoin) will compete and take over large portions of the global economy. In doing so, it will have to raise to moon values simply due to demand/scarcity of monetary units.

What will happen is as systems like the dollar and euro hyperinflate or die (like all fiats do), other fiats will gain popularity and bitcoin will be compared to bitcoin as a relative value pair. Bitcoins value against obsolete currencies, will in fact, increase forever against it.
In other words, once the Dollar or Euro's value is zero, bitcoin will be compared to the Dollar 2.0 or Euro 2.0 (because all value is relative). But these fiats will cease to exist in another several decades - the whole time bitcoin will generally/ultimately increase in value against them because they go to zero.

By keeping the keys off the computer, you avoid those kinds of loses. However, you do need to generate those bitcoins keys (paper wallets) on a secure computer. The best way to do this is to use a free "Live CD" that is kinda like a use once/throwaway computer - it boots from a CD and erases completely when you reboot.

False. The dollar, in its current form, has only been around since 1971 when they "redifined it" and took it off the gold standard.


My word is the bitcoin source code. It is provable that monetary inflation will take 130 years and do so over a very well defined curve - and not affected by any political policy. If you don't know this yet, then you really need to go study bitcoin a bit more.

If your drive holding the bitcoin key is encrypted, you must give up the encryption key. From there, they can decrypt your drive and get your private key to confiscate your funds as they please.
If your paperwallet is encrypted, you must give up the encryption key to decrypt it so they can confiscate your funds as they please.
If your bitcoin keys are not encrypted on any medium, they do not need any key to get around any encryption and thus can confiscate your funds as they please.
TL;DR They will confiscate your funds as they please - or you will spend at least 5 years in prison - at which point, they will ask again. Rinse, Repeat.

The internet is never going away. There will always be the ability to spend your bitcoins. It may be inconvenient and not easily accessible, but it will work. Look at gold. It's a universally understood store of value, yet you can't spend it anywhere. If the internet was not ubiquitously accessible in the future, bitcoin, and peoples value stored/recorded there will still be usable and have its value. Consider if bitcoin replaces your county recorder's office and your home title is recorded in the blockchain - you don't need to have access to transfer that house all the time. It might sit there for decades and never need to change ownership.

MTGOX IS A SCAM!!!
IF you get identity verified, you'll need to link your bank account to get your dollars out. At this point, they will tell you you'll need to "downgrade" your identify verified status so you can fill out a banking information form. Once this form is filled out, they will "test" your bank account information and then you'll need to be "upgraded" to identity verified again.
Each step in this process will take months and is designed for you to give up, buy your bitcoins back (and pay their commission twice), to move it to another exchange.

A hash of a CP image is not illegal. In fact, they are used by systems to identify the presence of CP.
It is entirely possible that some other [illegal number]( could be put into the blockchain, but it is highly unlikely something like that could bring down bitcoin. It is more likely that the IP owner would have no options but to say "FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU". Similar violations can be thought of in other contexts where society would just shrug their shoulders and say "oh well, it's too big to fail" and just deal with it.
In the scenario of having decryption keys to some piece of data in the blockchain that produced illegal material, then I suspect possession of the decryption keys, perhaps even in conjunction with possession of the blockchain, would result in a prosecution - not just having the encrypted data.

Close, but not really. Its in everyone's best interest to switch/fork if the changes bring new features or stability. The direction the project goes is determined by the miners. Remember, one of the rules of the protocol is longest block wins as it represents the most amount of work. After such a vote, miners will place their vote by working on the chain that supports their view of how things will be. A fork eventually occurs from the way the code interprets the transactions and different groups of miners start working on those chains. It becomes evident which chain is getting the most work by looking at the hash power of each network. If a few miners are the only ones left on a branch, they might decide "there is not enough support to make this a viable system, fuck it, I'll switch over with everyone else" OR "I believe in this, fuck it, I'm sticking with it and effectively making this my own alt-coin" (an taking the responsibility of maintaining it from there on out, either by themselves, or with that smaller community of developers/miners.
Basically, these development changes have the ability to make new altcoins and people will either support them or let them die. It is perfect evolution.
@_date: 2014-05-26 02:39:21
There are two pieces to consider with Bitcoin. A distributed payment network and a digital currency.
The Bitcoin payment network distributes the responsibility of processing user transactions to the entire community instead of placing that responsibility in the hands of a single entity like Visa/MC. As an incentive to do this work, individual processors are awarded new monetary inflation and receive transaction fees. Combined, the system creates an indestructible, unseizable, censorship proof, irreversible, and frictionless currency and payment network. Indestructible in that you can copy the ability to spend your funds any number of times. Unseizable in that you can protect those copies of information offline with strong encryption. Censorship-proof in that there will always be an individual payment processor with a financial incentive to include any transaction in the accounting ledger. Irreversible in that new transactions can only be written to the accounting ledger, never removed. Frictionless in that money flows like information on the Internet and it is trivial to send any amount of value to any user across any geo/political border, in seconds.
As for the digital currency itself, it is provably scarce with only 2.1 quadrillion atomic units of currency that inflates at a provable rate for approximately 140 years, at which point monetary inflation ceases and it will become a monetarily deflating currency through attrition. The inflation properties are guaranteed by mathematically controlled feedback loops and functions that throttle processing rewards and divide those processing rewards in half until the atomic unit is reached and no new money can be created.

As demand increases and bitcoins are used in larger and larger percentages of the global economy, the price must increase - it is the only adjustable parameter in the market capitalization equation. Fortunately, a single bitcoin is a rather large denomination and only those who can't get their mind around it will be the only ones not comfortable with such high exchange rates. That is, mbits are only about 80 cents these days and ubits are even cheaper.
TLDR, the exchange rate won't be stable until it's ubiquitously accepted by all merchants and consumer around the world. When that happens, someone buying a 100 million dollar mansion won't effect the market because the seller won't be "dumping" those coins on the market, he'll just be spending them outside the exchange market on something else he needs.

Reward halving is a somewhat elegant inflation control. The rule is to divide the previous reward in half every 210,000 blocks.
Bitcoin is an experiment. Satoshi could not have known how society would accept all of the parameters he codified in the protocol. Other forks of bitcoin have been free to experiment with their own rules and so far this is the one that has stuck.
I don't see it as a problem for miners. The market has seemed to plan these events well in advance of the actual event and the network, overall, handles them just fine.

You deposit bitcoins, sell them for dollars and pay their commission, can't withdraw them, buy back your bitcoins at a higher value and pay another commission, and take your bitcoins. How do we even know the exchange rate and volumes are what they say they are? NO FUCKING BUSINESS WOULD EVER GET AWAY FROM RUNNING LIKE THEY DO AND BE ABLE TO KEEP GOING.

If people add more computing power to the network, the "problem" is made more difficult to solve. If people remove computing power to the network, the "problem" is made easier to solve. This is how the network guarantees blocks can only be solved once every 10 minutes on average. 
Proof: Satoshi and Hal Finey were only able to make blocks once every ten minutes with their "two" computers. Today, we have tens of thousands of people working on validating transactions and we still have 10 minute blocks. If everyone but two people turned off their computers today, the blocks would eventually return to 10 minutes intervals.

Unconfirmed transactions sit in the RAM of every mining node until it either gets put in a block or its priority is reduced beyond the nodes ability to keep it around.

Sometimes some creative accounting can help you provide excellent discounts to your customers AND you get to keep a tidy profit. For example, buy some bitcoins and hold them. Let the market fluctuate. When the price is high for that "batch", sell it at an actual market discount. Lets say the "batches" value rises 10%, you sell that batch at 5% under market and keep the 5% for yourself. The customer gets a discount, you make a profit, and all you did was strategically sit on your bitcoins. And you ALWAYS get the sale because your ad is ~8% UNDER everyone elses.

What is this is for?  If it's just for getting your ip to broadcast to peers,  then it's not a very big deal. Current nodes are already connected and able to identify peers.  It's only new nodes that come up while the ip service is down that affects the network,  and even then,  can't you manually specify nodes to connect to if the ip service fails?

You dont need the private key to generate a bitcoin address. You just need some data that *should*, under normal circumstances, be a public key and hash it into an address.
However, satoshi did not do this. He created some arbitrary message as the public key (there was never a private key). The data he used as the public key was a message: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". There is no known private key that could generate a public key that happens to be that message. If you convert that message as you would a real public key, you'd get the address "1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa". There is no way to spend that money (or sign a message) because a private key does not, could not reasonably exist because satoshi would have had to brute force a private key that had a corresponding public key that read "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
PGP authentication is the only way to prove his identity.

A normal client only wants to connect to 6-8 nodes. That's just the way the client is coded. There are commands you can specify to connect to specific nodes, rather than randomly learned ones.

There are 100 MILLION "pennies" of a bitcoin! Yes, $600+ is a lot of money for a whole bitcoin, but you're buying, literally, a FUCKTON of satoshi when you do that.
If you use a more comparable monetary denomination like bits/ubits (with 2 decimal places for cents), then it starts to look more realistic of a fledgling global currency. That is, $1 USD buys you about 1600 bits, (1MM / exchange rate) which makes bits pretty fuckin cheap.

Again, with the internet not going away, the network will always converge and have consensus. Isolated networks will obviously fork, but the internet routes around damage and thus this is a very unlikely event, especially for timelines longer than a few hours. Yes, regular transactions won't work during network outages, but again, there are other apps for bitcoin coming down that pike that don't need instant, always on connectivity.

You're getting downvoted because you're wrong. Some of the miners would drop off. Not all of them.

Bitcoins are not infinitely divisible. The concept of a bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places, but it is a ruse. The actual storage of bitcoin values is an integer and the value of a bitcoin is 100 million of those integers. Therefore, you can't reference less than a satoshi, or 1 millionth of a bitcoin. I know this goes against everything you've read, but the code proves it.
    ​main.cpp
    static const int64_t MAX_MONEY = 21000000 * COIN;
    
    src/util.h
    static const int64_t COIN = 100000000;

The only problem with whitelists is the delay between a theft and a judicial ruling. those bitcoins could have been spent millions of times before a governing body makes an official decree on inputs.

There is no such thing as 21 mm (million) bitcoins - only 2.1 mmmmm (quadrillion) satoshi. 
Imagine a system that was made up of 1000 pennies. That's all the monetary units the system could allow for. If you have 100 of these pennies, you have what's called a dollar. That means there can only be 10 dollars ever created. Everyone's wallet in this system only displays values as fractions of dollars, not pennies. 
Let's imagine you have 2.53 dollars in your wallet. That's actually 253 pennies - because the system does not know what a dollar is. Humans have simply come up with the abstraction that 100 pennies equals a dollar, but the system that records all of the transactions does so in pennies.
Now let's say a bunch of people lots their money or threw it away because they didn't think this radical system of 1000 monetary units would take off and  about 500 pennies are taken out of circulation. The remaining 500 pennies are certainly not enough to run a proper economy, so people decide to divide them so more units are available and simply "split" everyone's holdings. 
So they change the system so that all wallets now display a thousandth decimal in the client and your balance shows $2.530 dollars. But remember, there is no such thing as a dollar, only pennies in the system. You still have only 253 pennies in your account. It's just displayed as $2.530 and the .001 is never spendable because it doesn't exist.
So what if we just double the amount of pennies in everyone's account AND redefine what a dollar is? To think this is possible, you have to gravely misunderstand how the blockchain creates monetary units. New blocks generate new satoshis and distribute them to the miners that secure the blockchain. There is no other way to create monetary units and expecially award them to all bitcoin addresses equally.

It is no big deal to allow for more bitcoins to be generated. it's just a couple lines of code. Getting miners to adopt it is a much bigger problem. They will have to be convinced to adopt the change. If there is no threat to the system, i.e. there are enough monetary units moving through the system at values that enable general commerce, then there would be no reason. If too many monetary units have been lost to forgotten passwords and such and the exchange rate makes it impossible to "buy a stick of gum" with it, then it may be deemed an emergency and a required to adopt or the currency would fail. It is not something that would be taken lightly, but it may be an easy enough decision to make when the time comes and the circumstances are correct.

No. There can only be 2.1 quadrillion satoshi - the mining subsidy (monetary inflation) is issued as an integer value in satoshi - That is the atomic unit of the currency. You cannot break any part of the currency down below a satoshi. You can redefine what a bitcoin is, to something MORE than 100MM satoshi, and you can allow more satoshi to be created, thus maintaining a ratio between satoshis and bitcoins, but you cannot divide a satoshi to a smaller unit because it is an integer.
Its difficult to get your eyeballs around this because every single client obfuscates this simple fact, but the truth is where the code is. The clients display the currency as a fraction of a bitcoin, but the information is stored as an integer and fractionalized against the arbitrary definition of a bitcoin that contains 100MM satoshi. 
This, and several other things, are a ruse by Satoshi to inhibit understanding and adoption of bitcoin before the code and infrastructure is ready to handle 7 billion people on the planet using it.

It's not an honor system. It's a risk assessed system, like anything else. Every business accounts for a certain level of theft and attempts to mitigate it somehow. Getting robbed at gun point? Install cameras and bullet proof shields. Getting $100 bills confiscated by the bank teller because your cashier didn't ink test the bill before accepting it? There are ways to mitigate bitcoin double spends as well that will be worked out as the technology becomes more accepted and understood. For instance, digitally signing transaction receipts with registered bitcoin addresses. 
Lets say double spending bitcoin thefts really becomes a huge problem, then, the merchant could say, you need to register a bitcoin key with us before you can pay with bitcoin. This key would be used to sign a transaction that states you bought gas with all the important details. If you double spend, then they know who to contact to get their money, or turn your information over to the police for investigation - including the legally binding digitally signed receipt you signed. This process could be done in milliseconds with no additional overhead or complexity than what is already experienced.

You're not breaking the law, per se, but if a law enforcement officer sees you with that money, in an certain context, he can literally simply say he suspects that money may have been used in a crime and seize it - at which point, you are obligated to prove you obtained it legally before the state is required to return it.

A bitcoin is defined as 100 million Satoshi. It is displayed as a fraction with eight decimal places. It cannot be "divided" further because the actual, real unit is the Satoshi, not a bitcoin.
To do what you suggest, you'd have to redefine what a bitcoin is, to say 200 million Satoshi, then inflate the monetary units to 200 million satoshi to "increase the divisibilty to 16 places". 
@_date: 2014-05-22 04:18:27
Nope.  It's everyone else that confirms the miner validated the transactions and issued the currency properly according to the protocol.

This is an overly complex solution that will obliterate uncountable critial dependencies that expect a monetary unit of bitcoin to simply be an integer.
Its much less risky and harmful to the network by simply adding logic that says something like if blockcount &gt; X, reward=reward+additional monetary inflation.
This would allow for more monetary units, decrease scarcity/price so that you could buy sticks of gum again - without forcing everyone to update bitcoin accounting software, wallets, and who knows what else.

A seed is used to kick start a pseudo-random number generator off on a determinable sequence of other random numbers. The purpose is to be able to generate a predictable and consistent series of random numbers (keys) from a single one so that only the first needs to be backed up or remembered.
If you kickstart the PRNG with a different seed, the result is a stream of completely different sequence of random keys.
IMO, Electrum is the most secure light weight client available, mostly due to its ability to create read-only wallets, and relatively easily sign offline transactions.

People cant agree on bitcoin/mbits/ubits/bits/satoshi. It is impossible to think there will be consensus on redefining a bitcoin from 100 mm satoshi to xxx mm satoshi. Imagine the confusion when you say "you owe me the 200 mm version of a bitcoin, not the 100 mm version", especially during the time that those extra units haven't even been created yet.
As a matter of fact, since monetary inflation beyond 21 mm is a forbidden change by itself, we would all be required to constantly change the definition of a bitcoin every single time a new block was created and issued the new satoshis.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:54:00
The problem with this thinking is that there is a huge amount of infrastructure that goes into supporting a crypto currency: wallet software, accounting management, exchanges, features, etc that give a crypto currency it's usability, acceptance and  value.

It does create a single point of vulnerability, but the size of the number possible as your seed is so ridiculously large, it would be impossible to brute force it. However, if you do something stupid with that single piece of information, like copy it unsecured somehow, you can lose everything. For the truly paranoid, put your seed on a dedicated computer, export the master public key to an online computer that you hardly ever use for anything, create unsigned transactions on the online computer, use a non-writable medium to copy the unsigned transaction to the offline computer that has the keys, sign the transaction, again use a non-writable medium to copy the unsigned transaction to the online computer and broadcast it. Then obliterate the media used to transmit that un/signed data.

Dogecoin was derived from litecoin. I am assuming that litecoin's implementation of scrypt  proof of work was not modified because it was originally meant to be a joke, so it not much of a leap that they didn't put much work into changing the protocol.

You are not taking into account there are two types of inflation. Monetary inflation and price inflation. If the monetary units become so scarce against the products they are chasing, then a single satoshi ends up not being able to purchase small items like a stick of gum. This is price inflation. By increasing the monetary supply, either by increasing the number of bitcoins, or dividing existing bitcoins, you will drive down its scarcity and reduce price inflation so that there are enough units to make such purchases. Making the pie bigger, or cutting it in smaller pieces ends up doing the same thing.

Neither of us know what exactly will happen in a global economic collapse and so we're down to discussing opinion. Mine is that the internet will survive. My evidence is that none of the technology of the day during the great depression went away. People still had access to telephones and communication networks.
There will always be networks of computers, thus the Internet. A global economic collapse does not mean the Internet will go away. It must means most people won't have direct access to it.
Lines connecting the Internet get cut all the time. Due to multiple route links, networks survive the damage. Thus, the Internet routes around damage is not a myth, but fact.
Yes, the bitcoin app called currency will fail in such a scenario, but it will also be relatively unaffected for alternate apps built on the protocol, like property management.

The core bitcoin code has checkpoints built in. This means that very old transactions are effectively locked in and can't be changed - or the database/ledger will be invalid.
Because of this, it is possible to copy someone else's blockchain, rather than syncing, and significantly reduce your start time. Your only vulnerability is then the delta between the current software's last checkpoint block, and the last block from the party from which you received the copy - and even that will be mitigated once you connect to random peers.
In the future, the entire blockchain may be pruned to reduce its size.

Can't find it, but it was an article that described the IMF's role in stabalizing national currency exchange rates between each other. Countries are required to pay into the IMF fund and the IMF manipulates the markets with those funds to attempt to keep the exchange rates stable. The point of the article was that there was nobody to give the IMF funds to stabilize the bitcoin exchange rate against all the other fiat currencies. One of the positions of the paper was that nation states needed to allow payment of taxation in bitcoin so a percentage of bitcoin could be contributed to the IMF. Another was that a nation state needed to purchase a percentage of their GDP in bitcoin and submit it to the IMF.

Bitcoin is not infinitely divisible. There is no such thing as a fraction of a bitcoin, technically speaking. The monetary unit is stored as an integer and monetary inflation comes by adding integers to the ledger. If monetary inflation happens, it will be by allowing higher block rewards. 
Such a change would be a hard forking event and unless such an event was the only way to save the currency from failure, it is highly unlikely that anyone would adopt the change.

No it cannot. The atomic unit is a satoshi which in an integer. all transaction values, including ones that create monetary inflation are integers - you cannot divide an integer. You can only add more of them, which is a [prohibited change](
The only way this works is by allowing additional monetary inflation and proportionally adjusting the definition of a bitcoin (100MM satoshi to something greater). That's like the FED saying we're doubling all the fiat bills in existence and calling everything a half-dollar bill from now on. Which is ridiculous.
Bottom line is, you've been "lied to"/mislead - bitcoins are not "infinitely divisible" as the base atomic unit is an integer.

You're confusing a private key that allows you to spend your bitcoins with an encryption key that protects your private key from unauthorized spending.
If your bitcoin private key is unencrypted, you don't need to give them any information - they will just take the funds and use it.
If your bitcoin private key is encrypted, you must give up the password that protects it and then they will take it and use it.

That's not what happened above. someone offered solution that wasn't a solution to the problem they specified. All altcoins have people who hold a hugely disproportional amount of wealth in that system. Simply switching to an altcoin does not make that problem of extreme unequal wealth distribution go away. Freicoin doesn't solve the problem either because anyone can avoid the fees by frequently spending their bitcoins to other accounts they own with zero contribution to real economic activity or transfer of wealth.

Developers talk about everything in public forums. Proposals are hashed out. Proofs are coded. When there is a disagreement on how something is to be done, then it is put to a vote by the miners by choosing new code, or not doing anything. The code forks the blockchain, or it doesn't and the overall community accepts and works with the new change or it doesn't. Future code can be written like "if block is greater than xxx, check for a new transaction type and process it." Bottom line is consensus. Forks may occur and people will vote by adopting the changes, or sticking to the old code.

The primary reason that litecoin went with scrypt was to prevent ASIC technology, which they believe will eventually result in centralized mining. Since their implementation of scrypt is flawed, and makes the proof of work system compatible with ASIC technology, their primary "benefit" of litecoin vs bitcoin goes out the window.

Direct inspection of the blockchain does not give anyone any information about account ownership. All you get is a bunch of long account numbers and it is anonymous.
Upon closer inspection, with tools like Bayesian Inference, you can start to build a picture of who owns what accounts by analysing movement of value between accounts. These tools already exist and are quite successful in the gaming industry and as terrorist network monitoring applications. They will, if not already, be applied to bitcoin transactions in the blockchain.
Bottom line is, bitcoin as a protocol is anonymous, but anonymity is not so easily maintained due to analysis tools and outside (the blockchain) points of reference.

Find more of you,  people that have and want to spend bitcoin.  Then organize regular weekly meet ups to talk and eat.  Then use them as a force multiplier to incentive merchants with your combined purchasing power. That is, organize "cash mobs" of people to come in to a merchant and show their excitement and commitment to spend money in their shop - if they learn about bitcoin. And they don't really need to accept it...  just learn something about it by watching each person negotiate a bitcoin payment between themselves or give them a paper bitcoin wallet and ask your group to pay their tips there and cash it out for the merchant and put the cash in their normal tip jar. Also, contact the guys at yBitcoin magazine and ask them to send you a carton of free magazines and hand them out to everyone, or leave several at a merchant so patrons can find/read them. Good luck!

Bitcoin, the protocol, does not do/use decimal places. The values of bitcoin transactions are stored in an [integer]( The base unit will always be a Satoshi, but the protocol can be manipulated to allow for more monetary units to be created. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:37:11
Yes,  looking at it wrong. .. bitcoin is a ridiculously large denomination with one hundred million atomic units each. These are like pennies compared to dollars. If you think about bits instead, then a single us dollar is equivalent to about 1700 bits. That puts the digital currency squarely in the cheap category.

@_date: 2014-02-03 17:27:19
You're mistaken.
As bitcoins become more scarce, their value increases so that not even mbits and ubits or satoshi can purchase small items.
If you increase the monetary supply by making the pie bigger, they become less scarce and less valuable relative to goods and they can again purchase those small value items.
If you increase the monetary supply by cutting the pieces of the monetary supply in to smaller pieces, you accomplish the same goal of decreasing their scarcity which makes them able to purchase smaller value items.
The difference is the "fairness" of distribution. Making the pie bigger enriches the mining operators because they get first spend of those new coins. Dividing the monetary units enriches all holders of bitcoin equally at the same time like a stock split.

Except that you can't actually divide bitcoin. You can divide the abstracted monetary unit they call bitcoin, but only down to "the 8th decimal place" that is a satoshi. You cannot "divide" it down any further, without redifining what the current definition of a bitcoin is, which is 100 million satoshi.

 You have been mislead. Bitcoin is not divisible. Storage is recorded in atomic integer units. You could create more atomic units, and then redifine a Bitcoin from "100 million atomic units" to something else like "200 million atomic units". But there is no way to "extend the decimal places" of bitcoin because they are not stored that way in the blockchain - only displayed as fractions in all the client software.

Miners actually pay their own bitcoin address newly generated coins "from nobody to myself in the amount of X"... and if they do the work properly, everyone in the network recognizes their contribution to securing new transactions, including the payment to themselves.
The only problem with what you said is that X is not 50. It was 50 bitcoin. But every 210,000 blocks X gets divided in half. It is currently 25 bitcoin. When we get to 420,000 blocks, it will divide again to 12.5 bitcoin.

The difference is that, with bitcoin, we are guaranteed a known inflation rate for generations until it ultimately is limited and ceases. Bitcoin's inflation is arguably more paletable since no central banker is benefiting from the first spend value of monetary inflation as it is fairly distributed across those working for it. 
If you understand/know the rules of the game, you can work with it - but with fiat, the policies of monetary inflation are based on the whims and potential profits of politicians and bankers.

Don't trust anyone with your coin. Export your private key some how, either by backing up your wallet file, or printing your private keys on paper (multiple times) and keep those copies secure and in different places so the information cannot be destroyed. Use encryption to prevent theft. The more third parties that have access to that information (your keys) the less secure you are.

He gets downvoted because he's making a tired argument that everyone that understands where this is going knows that it will get fixed. IP packets are software limited to a fixed size, but yet they allow all sorts of encapsulation to adapt to all kinds of data flows. Bitcoin is an extensible protocol that will adapt because there is a need for it to adapt since its core functions are so desirable. Bitcoin is 5 years old. Visa is 50+ years old. Do you think Visa could handle 11,000 TPS 50 years ago? Fuck no. Time and development will solve this particular problem.

The first thing that killed it for me was your explanation that bitcoin uses encryption (it's cryptography, specifically digital signatures). The other miss opportunity was when the math guy asked how is it limited to 21 million. You should have said the reward value that subsidizes the processing of transactions and inflates the monetary base is one that started at 50 bitcoins and is divided in half every 210,000 blocks, which results in zero monetary inflation after ~140 years. Kudos though for being on a panel, it is a nerve racking experience, especially when you first start doing them.

Plausible deniablity is the answer. Get a Yubikey, or similar single key keyboard. Program it to output a random string of characters. Set your passwords to be something like "&lt;KEYPRESS&gt;myDogIsCranky" or "&lt;KEYPRESS&gt;&lt;HOME&gt;&lt;RIGHTARROW&gt;&lt;RIGHTARROW&gt;myDogIsCranky" or something appropriately complex.
Because the Yubikey character string is complex and not meant to be remembered, you literally can't produce your passwords for a judge. All you know, is that you hit the Yubikey an then type in "myDogIsCranky".
As long as you can sufficiently make the Yubikey disappear before it can be confiscated (and probably even if you don't if you play your cards right), you'll have plausible deniability.
Further, you should make your passwords an admission of a crime like "I jaywalk  3very_day".

Curious, how do you think that "replacement" will happen? Altcoins are being created left-and-right as it is and nobody is adopting them. If one of them starts to take hold like Bitcoin, what do you think will be different that the rest of the world will go "oh that altcoin that is brand new? oh yea, we should totally adopt that over bitcion that's already been around for x+5 years. Forget about all that software and acceptance thats been built out - its totally played out now and this new altcoin will be the one".

Yes confirmations are like performing due diligence on checking for counterfeit bills. Nobody checks a $1 or $5 bill for counterfeit because it's simply not economical to attempt it. Some people don't even hold a $100 up to the light to look for the strip, let alone use an ink pen test.

You're not computing all that I'm saying. 
Yes, splitting the stock right now does nothing. It only has meaning when the value of the currency is greater than the smallest thing that needs purchasing.
Lets say in 2140, after all bitcoins have been produced, we find that only 1 million bitcoins are left in circulation. Everything else has been lost to attrition and the exchange rate is so high that a single satoshi is worth today's $20. You can't buy a cup of coffee with that.
You can either change the protocol to allow miners to create more than 21 million bitcoins, which would decrease their scarcity, and thus decrease their exchange rate so that a single satoshi can again buy the cup of coffee OR you can divide the pie so that the $20 satoshi can be divided into small enough units so the sub-unit will be equivalent to the price of a cup of coffee.

The scenario above was all the whales dumping their coins at the same time. Don't move the goal post. A single loner duming tens of thousands of bitcoins is a good thing long term because it reduces whales and distributes their coins to countless people.
The situation at mtcocks in 2011 is not a realistic market event. Transactions were rolled back because everyone understood it was stolen funds and the hacker was evading security controls to get more bitcoins out than the security policy would allow. $0.01 bitcoins was not a real number an the market rebounded reasonably fine after the event.

The problem with your theory is that it is clear that bitpay is not turning around and selling those bitcoins on the open market - they are selling them to private investers and partners so the price is not affected. Evidence of this is the sale of several million dollar real estate and luxury vehicles purchases that have gone through bitpay and those coins never turned the market down.

All currency/commodity pairs have an established value. One is worth and specific amount in the other. Markets make this determination. If the exchange rate between bitcoin and dollars is 1 bitcoin per 800 dollars, then it doesn't mean that bitcoins are pegged to the dollar in any way - that's just a comparison you're making. Markets make the value go up and down for all pairs - euro/usd, usd/gold, etc. None are "pegged" or dependant on the other, it's just a relative comparison of value.
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:07:17
That would be a gain and you would be liable to report it and pay a tax on the gain. Would they find out if you didn't? Not with a single stamp,  but the more you do that or the more regulated the thing that you are trading is,  the more likely they will catch it. 
Money laundering would be taking those $5 gains you made from drug sales and running it through a legitimate business to make it appear the earning were not from drugs. 
Money laundering would also be keeping your legitimate earnings in cash,  all of it,  or at least 10k, and getting seen with it in almost any context.  You will be guilty of money laundering until you prove yourself innocent and your money will be seized.

Typical bitcoin transactions move bitcoins from one account to another. Those bitcoins existed before, in another account, and are moved to another. Think of it literally as a bank draft check being written that says "Pay X bitcoins to account Y, from my account Z" and wrapped in a digital signature.
When miners solve a block, they get to make a special bank draft that says "Pay SUBSIDY_AMOUNT bitcoins to MY account Y, from NO ACCOUNT" and wrapped in the crypto signature of the block itself - literally bringing new bitcoins into existence from nothing.

TLDR, zero confirmation can be acceptable risk.
Think of it like cash transactions. No cashier will ever think to counterfeit check a $1, $5, or even $10 bill. They just stick it in the till and hope for the best. With a $20, they *might* hold it up to the light and look for a stripe. With a $100 they will hold it up to the light and *might* ink check it. The more value you're dealing with, the more due diligence you put towards verifying the authenticity.
The same thing goes for bitcoin. You can basically accept small transaction amounts because the cost to double spend is high. But wait for a max 6 confirmations for extremely high value amounts. How many you wait for depends on your risk of losing that amount, trust for the person you're dealing with, etc.

So the value gold has for electronics is a very small part of its whole value. That is, intrinsic value is not the same thing as an item's whole value. Some value is attributed to usefulness like electronics, some is attributed to human desire and the market enforces the price of all of it. So what if bitcoin doesn't have "intrinsic" value - it has other values and human demand and the market CLEARLY has established a value for it above zero.

It is entirely possible to create a new transaction type that allows for an invalidation of a transaction. It is important to understand that this would be an entirely new transaction type and would not invalidate other transaction types.
Basically, a bitcoin transaction is a function that returns true or false. What that transaction computes to determine a true or false state is upto the function.
For instance, one of the things a function might do is ask an Oracle if this transaction hash is whitelisted. If it is, the transaction returns true and everyone sees it as a valid transaction in the blockchain. But if the Oracle ever changes its mind in the future, everyone instantly sees it as an invalid transaction, and thus, everything else after it.
Kinda crazy for anyone to buy into that at first glance, but it does have its merits in some contexts.

In that example, transactions would already be sync'd through the normal propagation of blocks. What would be wierd is the state of transactions could change as people recalculated their individual blockchains.
Confirmations for these transaction types would almost be meaninless as an Oracle could return false for a transaction 1000 blocks ago. This would cascade transaction failure to all children.
This sounds like a really bad thing, but again, I think this might only be useful in some contexts. Perhaps non-monetary contexts like colored coins? I dunno. That's one of the wonderful things about Bitcoin - we really don't know where this bitch is going or what it is capable of. Kinda like setting off our first nuke all over again.

I can only really help if you're running linux.
I start bitcoind with "bitcoind -daemon". To test that it is working and available, run "bitcoind getblockcount" and "bitcoind getconnectioncount". Verify the blockcount is close to what blockchain.info is seeing.

Take Gold and the inherent value it has to be used in as jewelry. It's true, people use it for that and that gives is some value, but I don't wear jewellery, so that aspect of it has no value to me. Same goes for water. If you have a pool of it in your back yard, that inherent value goes down because, meh, there's a pool of it. But if you're in a barren desert in Africa, that water's inherent value means a lot more to people there.

I simply argue that "intrinsic value" is only a component of something's "total/true" value. Some things may have zero or some non-zero intrinsic value - but it is only an additive component that increases the total value. Gold may have an intrinsic value in its utility in science and fashion, but Bitcoin's ability and other properties are additive components that gold or many other things can't relate for there is no context. But each has properties of value that contribute to its over all value.

Ask a state run death oracle if Joe Shmoe is dead so a transaction will be paid out. The oracle signs a transaction saying Nope, Joe Shmoe is still alive. So Joe Shmoe will forever be alive? Or do you think the oracle might be able to revoke that answer and re-write it as true? Or perhaps the Oracle never signs anything and just returns a state that clients will validate on the fly by querying the Oracle directly?

There is a default "gap" in an electrum wallet - this is the number of unused addresses the wallet will maintain at all times. The default is 5 - so the wallet will always keep 5 addresses free. If you spend to one of them, the wallet will create a new free one at some point so there are 5 again.

Those 184 billion coins were the result of an unsigned integer bug. It was reversed because the blockchain was reverted before it caused significant damage to its reputation. The decision to revert was a majority consensus - everyone mining understood the problem, the problems it would cause, and agreed to start mining right before the coins were created. 
Another event like this happened recently where a hard fork between client versions caused them to process different versions of the blockchain. Once again, within about 6 hours, everyone came to the same consensus of what needed to happen - rollback of one of the chains and everyone begin mining on the "correct" chain.
It is important to understand the collaboration and communication among miners that happens before these type of events - they are not taken lightly. If the event that there is not consensus, then forks will happen and a new cryptocoin will be born. If there is not enough support to continue development on both chains, or grow the infrastructure, then one will eventually die.

There WILL be a huge crash in bitcoin and it will be the result of a massive theft of bitcoin from individually stored online wallets. Some piece of malware will propagate and stay dormant until its network has collected a large amount of private keys and sweep them all away instantly at the same moment.
This will cause a massive loss of confidence around the globe and the price will plummet. And I will be right there to pick up the cheap pieces at the bottom of the market. This event will not kill Bitcoin. It may take a LONG time to recover, but it will eventually make the world more secure by forcing people to take security seriously.

I don't know what to say to you if you think it's ok for a central entity to have so much control over a currency.

Crime isn't "that bad" where I live. There are much worse places to live. But crime can happen anywhere, and any time, without your approval or awareness. I do lots of things to keep myself safe - live in a gated community, don't hand out in barrios, stay home after dark, watch my surroundings and leave if something looks sketchy - and carry a gun. If you have a fire extinguisher in your house, or have fire/accident insurance, you can begin to understand why I carry a firearm. You don't expect bad things to happen, but you do prepare for them. Fortunately, I live in a jurisdiction that allows me to protect myself. (yes, it would be nice if the world didn't have people that wanted to initiate violence, but it's silly to think that is a reality)

I think your game theory is wrong. This could be early whales getting out/taking profits with their cheap coins and spreading them to people at "newer highs" (especially at the end of the year for tax purposes). Those new people are not interested in letting go under what they go in, so they hold for the market recovery. This process isn't "evil market manipulation" if the whales are uncoordinated individuals looking out for the own best interest, it's just the market playing out (are the old whales with lots of coins obligated to hold them forever? what is a reasonable exit strategy, or do they have to hold forever??). If the protocol is secure, the infrastructure continues to grow, then the prices will recover, just like they have twice before, just like they have in any other context.

You make it sound so easy for an altcoin to rise to the occation, but in reality, its ridiculosly difficult because there is a high cost to infrastructure change. All the systems being built now are bitcoin protocol based and for anyone in the ecosystem to integrate an alt-coin will have to at least double their development workload to adopt each separate altcoin - and for what gain? Look at all the protocols that were developed to evolve email and crush spam. they were good ideas, but were too expensive in infrastructure upgrade costs. No altcoin offers any significant advantage that bitcoin can't address or adapt to.

As I understand Communism's means of collecting/claiming all resources "for the people, and ultimate goal is to self-remove those power structures "in the end", it is not human nature to do so (give up such power). It will never happen. I believe this is the ultimate division between anarchism - they both want freedom, but it is naive to think that anyone given power to rule will give it up "when society is ready for it".
In a utopian world, I am an anarchist because the there can be no power structures to violate a minority's natural rights. But as a realist, I am a Libertarian because it is a more realistic goal to shoot for - The sole role of government should be to protect its citizens from fraud and violence. Period. Everything else is just redistribution through force or playing favorites.

something similar with me. My order was held up by weather and a delay due to lack of inventory of the commemorative bitcoin silver round. They said they would be happy to ship the "other stuff" immediately and then ship the bitcoin round separately. This caused me a little extra pain though because they did not ship it 2-3 business day as I originally ordered. The "other stuff" is scheduled to arrive Monday and I dunno when then bitcoin rounds will ship.
Related, I called in the other day to find out what the F was going on, and the lady that answered the phone was a facebook friend that recognized my name from a bitcoin group. Pretty small bitcoin world.

Yes, there is some slippage. The system attempts to maintain one block every 10 minutes (on average) but increases in hashrate (and decreases) cause this rate to fluctuate. The new difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks by looking at block datestamps that far back.
So in times of new mining technology growth, hash rate increases faster than the feedback loop can throttle it... but during times of sluggish exchange rate growth or fall, miners will shutdown their unprofitable units and the rate slows.

Monetary inflation comes from a calculated reward value. This reward value, at the genesis block was 50 bitcoins that could be claimed by the miner every time they created a block. The calculation that must be adhered to by the protocol is to decrement the previous reward value by half every 210,000 blocks. Eventually, around 2140 AD, the reward value will effectively equal zero.

namecoin transactions can record name pairs like "google.bit" and "192.168.1.1" domain and IP address relationships. If adopted en mass, it would only apply to something like the TLD .bit. But it can easily apply to .onion domains so that you can redirect google.bit to an onion address (TOR hidden service).
On awesome by product of namecoin is the  irreversibility of these name pair associations... that is, effectively, domain names would be unseizable or irreversible just like bitcoin's transactions. Combine this with .onion/tor hidden services and you can begin to have bulletproof, unseizable and anonymous hosting on the Internet. No amount of bitching, complaining, or bullets could make wikileaks.bit go away.

No PII is recorded in the blockchain. Only account numbers. If each of you hold to the rule of never telling anyone where they came from, they can't be linked to someone. But there will always be someone that knows the association of a source address and person - as it is with any transaction. If you give $10 to a cashier, they know you gave it to them. They will never know who gave you that $10 if you don't tell them and/or "can't remember".

The RPC daemon for the client *might* use the same API. But the APIs to the exchanges to pull data, the interfaces to display currency pairs, charts, and other data all have to be integrated for each new alt coin. It's tens of thousands of lines of code to implement a new coin - at each exchange and for each tool used to make the coin useful.
Why do you think there are no variety of wallets for altcoins? Why doesn't someone port blockchain or mycelium or electrum to xcoin? Because it's a LOT of work, and then there is maintaining it... This is why altcoins **really** have to bring something innovative and useful to the table to be taken seriously.

Waiting for confirmations is like checking for counterfeit bills. Nobody checks $1s, $5s, or $10 - they just stick them in the till with understanding that its just too costly for someone to go through that trouble to counterfeit them. When you get to $20s, tellers *might* hold it up to the light and look for the strip. $50 and hundreds will get a ink or UV test.
The same applies to Bitcoin. Small transactions are usually just accepted because of the cost of maliciously double spending. The problem is that nodes are relaying the transaction, which in the absence of malicous double spending, should mean its valid enough to be included in the blockchain. I know the merchant received the initial notification in their client - but something caused the mining nodes to not include the transaction in the block and the unconfirmed tx was flushed from the memory pool.
Yes, waiting for 6 confirmations is the safe way to go, but not practical in all situations, especially live exchanges at a brick and mortar establishment.

If so, there is an algorithm called Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme that allows you to break up your password into shares and distribute them to trusted people. Each share is as strong as the original secret, but when combined with enough other shares, the original secret is fully disclosed.

Hashrate and difficulty only function as a feedback loop to throttle block creation. There is another component that throttles monetary inflation that is called the block reward. This value started off at 50 BTC for each block and every 210,000 blocks (~4 years) gets divided in half.

Depends on what you mean by "account for"... The system accounts for all bitcoin. The blockchain is an accounting ledger containing the genesis and entire history of every single bitcoin. If someone misplaced their private keys, or lets them be destroyed, the ledger remembers what private keys can be used to spend them, regardless of whether those keys are accessible or not. It is mathematically improbable that "lost bitcoins" can ever be spend again. Ever.

I will.
There is no part of the protocol that enables you to store PII in the blockchain.
Consider this...
If you move to a new community. Nobody knows who you are. You are anonymous. But eventually, you need to engage the community to survive. If you walk down the street and yell your name "MY NAME IS BOB!", then you are throwing away your anonymity and revealing who you are. 
Lets try a more subtle approach... this time, you only announce who you are to the people you need to deal with. The grocery store cashier learns you're bob through casual interactions. The barber as well. Same with your direct neighbor.
Like it or not, you have given away your anonymity. Each of those people you communicate with has distributed knowledge of your identity and have the ability to give you up if someone comes looking for you.
Yes people might be able to be tracked down in the future through Bayesian inference, but those will be using datapoints outside of the Bitcoin protocol.
Bitcoin is anonymous - but average people don't use it that way.

At the current exchange rate, $804, a single USD buys you 120,000 "bit pennies", called Satoshi.
typically, when you buy something with a bill larger than the value of the item you're purchasing, the cashier will give you change. In bitcoin, if you have an 'input' greater than what you're trying to spend, you create one output to the bitcoin address you're paying in the exact amount, and another input in the amount of the different minus a fee that goes back to either the original address, or a new address. (you make change to yourself, and what you don't spend back to yourself gets collected by miners as the transaction fee)

Not if you have encrypted the wallet file with a strong passphrase.


When you restore a wallet, there is no passphrase. It is prompting you for a new passphrase to encrypt the new .dat file. You can use your old passphrase at this time. If you don't choose a passphrase at this prompt, the .dat fille will be created with no encryption.
The seed is not a password. it's just a large random number that determines the sequence of pseudo-random numbers generated by a random number generator. The password is the key used to AES encrypt the seed.

Yep. Just to address a pet peeve... there are two kinds of inflation - monetary inflation and price inflation.

I will argue that there is no way to determine the monetary base of Bitcoin because unknown amounts have been destroyed, are unspendable, or otherwise unrecoverable.
Both Monetary base and Monetary supply refer only to a count of monetary units - and not their value. Supply is all monetary units, and base are those units in circulation. Since all values require a reciprocal pair, i.e. this orange is worth two apples, the market cap is the correct term to evaluate the potential of X relative to Y.
The market cap of stock ABC is the shares multiplied by the share price in dollars. Similarly, the market cap of bitcoin is the (monetary base/supply) multiplied by the unit's value in dollars.

At the same time , domestic bitcoin announced the resumption of trading platforms charge a fee . Since the September 25 bitcoins China announced fee-free , Bitcoin transactions are booming , in order to maintain price stability Bitcoin , Bitcoin China decided to start to charge a fee , the rate of 1% . Subsequently , OKCoin notice that, in order to prevent malicious speculators raise or lower prices for market manipulation , OKCoin resume two-way charge transaction fees .
User Xiaoming said that initially when the advent of bitcoin , bitcoins each only one-tenth the price of $ 1 , and when now each Bitcoin prices rose $ 1,242 , those who initially held Bitcoin no shot of truth, because Bitcoin frenzied speculation may generate investment bubble. Moreover , as a decentralized virtual currency , the hype behind this concentration , it is difficult to say no agency handling predators , many people rush the occasion , will be hidden behind the body in hands .

What is Bitcoin ? Bitcoin ™ (BitCoin) is a P2P form of virtual currency . Point to point transmission means a decentralized payment system. Bitcoin monetary institutions do not rely on a specific issue , it generates a large number of specific algorithms to calculate by using a distributed database Bitcoin economy throughout P2P networks composed of many nodes to identify and record all transactions. The decentralized P2P features and algorithms can not by itself ensure that a large number of manufacturers to artificially manipulate currency Bitcoin . Based cryptography design allows bitcoins can only be transferred or paid real owner. This also ensures the anonymity of ownership and circulation of currency trading .
Bitcoin features: to the center , in circulation worldwide , exclusive ownership , low transaction costs , no hidden costs , cross-platform mining.

You **can** generate "free money on your computer", but you're doing so competitively with everyone else on the planet. You can imagine the profitability of this would be very slim since everyone is trying it.
You can't buy them with reversible transaction systems because of the risk of being frauded. This only really applies to strangers. I've sold lots of bitcoins to friends and family via my square reader. This works because my friends and family know I will break their fucking neck if they scam me. This won't work so well with a stranger you just met and will never see again.
Once you experience bitcoin: buy some, hold some, watch them rise in value over a period of time, spend some, etc, then you honestly won't want to use anything else.

It is very difficult to judge the number of individual humans buying into bitcoin and there has only been one POS system released that helps brick/mortar merchants process bitcoin.

All you really need to copy/restore your wallet is the seed stored in the .dat file. You can export this seed from the GUI, or commandline. This seed is all the information the client needs to reconstruct all the private keys associated with this seed.
If anyone gets ahold of this seed, they can spend all your bitcoins. It is possible to encrypt your wallet so this seed is secure - and it is even possible to store this seed outside of a wallet, so the wallet can only construct the public keys making it a "read only" wallet. The "Master Public Key" is that "crippled" seed.
It is not possible to restrict someone's ability to see your balance if they have your master public key.
If your wallet encryption passphrase is super strong, then it is safe to store on a 3rd party service. It basically comes down to how long you'll be using that passphrase. If the password strength is only good for 5 years of brute force attacks, then you should consider that wallet expired after that time and move your bitcoins to a new wallet.

I've always liked aliases better. You simply pay an email address. The address gets torn down into a URL. Then the URL is retrieved to get the bitcoin address.
For example, you pay AgentZeroM The protocol splits username and domain and forms the url  and gets a bitcoin address.
Trusted signing authorities can be used to protect the address in transit.
Note: Electrum supports this.

Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks and ultimately settles to the new hash rate every 8064 blocks. You would have to apply some ridiculous magnitudes of power every 8064 blocks to do this in a second.
The 21M upper limit is based on a block reward value that divides in half every 210,000 blocks. Once the reward equals a satoshi and the reward halves again, there just isn't an amount added to the fees the miner collects.

If you make it too fast, then network latencies cause orphaned chains and you'll see higher number of confirmed blocks disappear more regularly. As an example, LTC requires about 4 times as many blocks to one bitcoin block for equivalent security that the blocks will remain secure from orphaning.

I really don't understand where this guys is coming from. Everything in a market is manipulatable. Everything. The difference is Bitcoin still beats out hard assets in ALL the good properties of money: Scarcity, divisibility, fungible, portability, durability. The only thing it really kinda sucks at is acceptability - and that is only a matter of time. People aren't going to look at all the other good properties and say "oh, shit no! I don't want any of that useful properties! Move my money instantly anywhere, duplicate it to hedge against destruction and encrypt it to hedge against theft? Fuck all that!"

If you use a client like Electrum, you can use the hash of that crazy passphrase as a seed for the wallet. This will allow the wallet to create a deterministic sequence of bitcoin addresses based on that passphrase/seed. Basically, it will be able to generate all the bitcoin keys it will ever need, all pseudo-random, but determined by that initial seed. Use the same seed, get the same string of keys.

1. Generate a bitcoin address.
2. go to bit2factor.org and encrypt your private key (these two steps can safely be done offline with html from bitaddress.org and bit2factor.org
3. encode the encrypted private key into a QR code. Good luck on windows, easy on linux with qrencode.
4. encode the public key into a QR code.
5. print both out to about 1" square. place them back to back and laminate them. Cut down to a small border for convenience.
6. obtain erection
Now that you have a encrypted paper wallet, when you want to spend:
1. open mycelium
2. select 'cold storage'
3. scan private key and type in passphrase. key only stays in memory, not stored in your wallet/local storage
4. type in amount
5. scan recipient address or select from address book
6. send
7. masterbate

Absolutely... If bitcoin does not take off as a globally competitive currency and ends up being relegated to basement neckbeards to only foster the exchange of trading cards, then yes, it will eventually be secured by GPUs once again. But I don't think that's ever going to happen. Example: Just two weeks ago, I was only earning a meager .17 bitcoins per day mining. At $130/xbt, I was down and sad. But now that they are $270/xbt, I feel A LOT better about keeping my ASICs going for another good while because .17 xbt is worth that much more.

That's not how Open Source works.


@_date: 2013-10-28 17:54:40
pgp is used to sign/verify messages to provide integrity and to encrypt those messages for privacy.
Integrity allows both parties to know the bitcoin payment address is secure in transit and can't be modified without detection. Without it, the address could be changed in transit to an attacker's bitcoin address, thus the funds stolen. Privacy allows both parties to know the payment address and/or meetup details are private between the two individuals.
I highly recommend you use a mobile app like slingsafe for this type of communications. It's open source, easy to use, and offers all the same features like pgp offers.

No, non-random passphrases are always going to be more susceptible to attack. Deterministic sequence keys are just a way to create the same bitcoin keys over and over from a known starting number.
Hashes derived from common, known, published sentances are all bad and you should consider any keys derived from these types of passphrases as compromised - as it's trivial for someone to compile lists of these well known sentences and generate keypairs, import them to a wallet and withdraw the money anytime someone is dumb enough to use them.

There are actually 2.1 quadrillion monetary units of Bitcoin - not 21 million. That's "enough" to support a large percentage of a world economy. Calculating fractions is trivial for those of us that know how to move a decimal place. "point zero zero three" bitcoins is 3 mbits. Done.

Feedback loop in the protocol makes the problem of validating transactions easier or harder based on the amount of computing power applied to the network over the last 2016 blocks of transactions. The protocol ensured that blocks can't be created faster than once every 10 minutes, on average.
Basically, part of the computation is guessing a hash value with a certain number of leading zeros. It's effectively guessing random numbers that are not trivial to guess. By increasing the number of required leading zeros, or decreasing them, the problem is made easier or harder.
It was designed to be steady so that for generations to come (130 years or so) the monetary inflation of bitcoin is well known, 100% transparent, and expected (unlike fiat inflation).
