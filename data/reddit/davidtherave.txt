in the core software? absolutely, yes, that is too much to ask. this shouldn't be in the core software, this should be provided by third party tools. and it is.
the CLI is used by people who know exactly what they want to do and want to do EXACTLY that without having to take longer to click around a GUI that performs a limited set of operations. it is for technical users. one would expect that someone who wants to run internet service infrastructure would be a technical user. i'm a server admin and i don't spend all day staring at a bunch of terminal tabs because of fucking stockholm syndrome.

as we're discussing, a 'decent' interface means something COMPLETELY different, depending on who you're asking. for this reason, we should not be hostage to the core developers to provide an interface that any given user is going to think is 'decent'.


it's not that it doesn't work for the tools i use, it's that a GUI generally *cannot* work to provide all possible operations that you conceivably would want to do in a way that is clean, simple, and efficient.

christiana isn't a state. it's a very small area in which there's an unspoken agreement that they won't fuck with the people who reside there.
