No. That's literally what the wallets name is... Bitcoin Core. Stop politicizing shit that's not political.

If you are not a troll and interested in positive conversations about bitcoin and other finances, consider checking out cryptocrypt.org. 
Edit: I will send out invites to anyone who sends me proof of a post/reply of yours that was either thoughtful/insightful/helpful.

Uh, let's not be Kentucky. You don't know all the crazy shit our Governor is trying to do.

Can confirm! Bought two notebooks 3 years ago. Still using them every day! They have quite a few coffee stains on them now, but have held up amazingly.
@_date: 2015-07-31 13:42:04
Yep, that's I believe. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:50:34
Maybe other subreddits are just gaining popularity faster?

Wow! What an honorable man. Must be an Arsenal fan too! Btw, U.S. Pizza gooner here!

I don't trust many articles that have spelling errors and don't provide a link to a video.

What do you currently do for work?
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:36:30
Looks like someone(s?) has a script to check it automatically and empty it out immediately. Paid off for them this time...
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:41:29
Woohoo! Ranked  - next milestone (end of the week?) is in the Top 200!
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:22:51
Misleading title.
@_date: 2015-11-14 22:06:51
The difference is that settlements take a lot longer in the stock market, where bitcoin is "instant."
@_date: 2015-11-19 23:04:35
Sorry, but you were not one of the persons affected. If you were, you would not agree with all four of your statements.
@_date: 2015-11-14 21:19:56
Did this morning at 7am. Waiting to get a response. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 22:05:42
But when it happens in the opposite direction they reverse it?
@_date: 2015-11-14 22:11:37
Exactly. 
Additionally, read their user agreement: 
"...we are not liable to you, any other person or any institution:
vi. for the price at which you buy or sell Digital Assets on Gemini;
Please also note the following risks in accessing or using Gemini:
ii. The price and liquidity of Digital Assets has been subject to large fluctuations in the past and may be subject to large fluctuations in the future."

I took snippets from the user agreement that support the trade and do not support their reversal:
GEMINI INFORMATION ACCURACY, LIABILITY AND RISKS
While we strive to provide you with accurate information, we cannot guarantee that information on Gemini will always be accurate. As a result, we are not liable to you, any other person or any institution:
iv. for any transaction you initiate or attempt that is not completed;
v. for any transaction that is completed;
vi. for the price at which you buy or sell Digital Assets on Gemini;
Please also note the following risks in accessing or using Gemini:
ii. The price and liquidity of Digital Assets has been subject to large fluctuations in the past and may be subject to large fluctuations in the future.
You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for you, and that Gemini does not give advice or recommendations regarding Digital Assets including the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, Digital Assets. You acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use Gemini at your own risk. However, this brief statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with trading in Digital Assets. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources.

You are responsible for making sure that any Orders entered on Gemini are accurate and intentional. We may, in some cases, and at our discretion, require secondary electronic, verbal, written or other confirmation before acting if your account activity is outside of your normal range of activities.

This should NOT be reversed. Everyone should read the user agreement who were affected. 
I am fighting that judgement.
@_date: 2015-11-14 21:38:35
Also, what is interesting is they must have rushed to send a statement because the subject line was spelled incorrectly as, "Trade reversal notificiation"
I know... Small oversight.

Why would he want anyone to come document his place of business? He's provided proof in the past.

I like how a dedicated bitcoin programmer made a comment that was deleted just now. Top job mods! /s

Get 'em Dan! 
I agree with you and enjoy reading your posts!
