How many do you have that a spike makes you $3000?

My coworker has been telling me since last year when it was at like $800 to buy in. I've known about it almost since it first came out but never bought in. I've been a bit short on cash so finally bought in around 4000-5000 but only small amounts. Currently almost made triple my investment though

So youre saying everyone needs some sort of secure device that is never connected to the internet? How do you expect adpption in that case? How will coins ever get used?

I'm new as well to this. Why should I move them away from coinbase?

Why would they lock you?

This is under the assumption everyone got in a year ago and has done nothing sense.

I'm just trying to get into bitcoin and just got verified on coinbase. What is wrong with coinbase? Should I not buy anything from there?
What is this "great Coinbase rush"?

I just started as well. You sign up, create an account, verify phone # and email, attach a bank account/card to purchase with, and verify your identity. From there you can Buy/Sell.

Log doesn't make sense to me though. It seems to severely downplay the amount of money, as an individual, I've lost.
