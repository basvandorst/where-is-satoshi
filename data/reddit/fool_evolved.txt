This is why I decided to "invest" in Bitcoin. I was watching bitcoin at 1k thinking it couldn't go any higher. Then eventually it hits 3k and I'm convinced it's a bubble about to burst. Goes down to 2k and I'm convinced it will crash. Then it goes up to 4k, down again and up to 6k.
All that time I'm on the "Blockchain is an interesting technology and has a lot of potential for technological disruption, but surely Bitcoin is overvalued". Then I decided that no on really knows what's going to happen and it's very possible you can't apply traditional financial thinking to Bitcoin and purchased some.

Today Bitcoin was claimed dead. Today Bitcoin lives.

You can [view]( the transaction go through the confirmation process on the block chain - that will be proof it worked.

I've only done two trades. Around the time when we first breached 10k I had sold expecting the price to go back down to around 8.8k It went to 11k then dropped to 8.7k and Coinbase friggen crashed when I tried to buy back in at my price and I got locked out. Good timing, but unlucky Coinbase crashed.
The second time was when we breached 19k. Sold at 19k and got back in at 15.2k. I was lucky Coinbase didn't crash that time.
I probably just got lucky with the timing, but the only times I ever feel comfortable trading on swings is when there is huge momentum in the price.

This is a great point and it is being addressed. Satoshi will appear on Jimmy Fallon's The Tonight Show next week to discuss the current state of Bitcoin and set things straight. Stay tuned.

Actually if you read the thread it's pretty funny, especially the fact that the meme has carried on for this long.

I sold at around 9.7k with the plan to re-enter at 10.3k or 8.9k. Lesson learned, I am not a crypto trader. Time to go back to hodling.
