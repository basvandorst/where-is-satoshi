* Expect losses in your investments.
* It's a risk
* It's essentially gambling
* The difference between day trading and long term couch potato investing (HODLing)
* Be very skeptical of new coins popping up in the market. They all tend to have the same marketing schemes and you'll never really know if a coin is a scam or not because everyone's source these days is all just based on online discussions and at this point, shilling is a pretty common tactic (which unfortunately, also works quite well on newcomers. For example,  EOS ( and Karbon( literally use the same website design and that alone is enough to raise a red flag for me.
I mean, just because they use the same web layout doesn't necessarily mean they are scams - my point is that right now crypto is slowly breaking into mainstream and ICOs is the new kickstarter scam, with no guarantees of delivery or future support.

I really want to buy BTC but wondering if even just spending 50$ CAD is worth it. 
LTC/ETH seems more appealing just because I can get that one, whole coin. I don't want a partial :(

I don't post about how I bought Bitcoins. 
That's the thing - Facebook gets data from the websites you visit, the Facebook pages you check out, the very mention of cryptocurrencies in your convo logs and uses that info to market to you.

I'm still fairly new to BTC but aren't fees automatically adjusted on our wallets/exchanges when transferring?
Is there any reason to set your own fee?
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:54:39
I see. So if I'm not in a rush to move my BTC from my exchange to my wallet, I can adjust to a lower fee?
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:46:08
why not? if there are no more miners and one person comes in, they'd be the only to profit from it, no?

Could be worse. Like buying 2 pizzas for 10 000 btc

It's also advantageous to those who are hodling/day trading.

But this is exactly what's happening with Bitcoin. Right now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:53:10


And in the end, the people who are willing to pay those fees are the ones who are incredibly loaded with BTC to begin with.

How so? it doesn't hurt to put a few hundreds or a grand or two on the side. 1% of savings is pretty negligible but can be pretty huge for a crypto investment.

Just buy it now, because regardless if you hold it long term, it's likely going to go up.

There is supposedly another hardfork (or change, not sure) happening in november which is making some people uncertain about BTC/
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:53:57


I'd imagine that those with a large amount of bitcoin would probably have the utmost freedom of mobility, moving between 1st to 3rd to developing countries without any worries.

Fuck that. Don't change what already works. I've been around LJ, Friendster, Myspace, etc on several social network and unnecessary layout changes is what drives the users away.
I wouldn't mind extra features, but the layout and current color scheme, etc is fine.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:17:38


Atomic swaps will solve this problem, no?

I dunno about you but since I've started taking interest in Bitcoin, I've been BOMBARDED by ICO ads and shitcoins on Facebook.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:52:00


I mean...it's still being used as currency. 
Just not for small items like a coffee or small drug purchases on the Darknet, but rather large massive flows of money laundering in super high numbers.

But at the same time, if all the big league miners jump ship, wouldn't this present an opportunity for newcomers to get into the mining game?
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:28:19
But then I can also say that me holding bitcoin and not spending while OTHERS spend is far more beneficial for ME in the long run.
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:07:48


wait what. shit.

Don't you get charged fees if you transfer directly to a wallet? Apparently you should transfer to GDAX, then your wallet.
