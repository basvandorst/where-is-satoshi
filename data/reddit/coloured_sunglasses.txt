I don't think it needs to have it's own unique value in terms of utility to remain relevant in the long term. LTC shares what BTC has, brand recognition, a proven track record, and a good core team of developers.
LTC has remained a top ten crypto while others have dropped. Remember when LTC and Dash were neck and neck last year? I think we are much more likely to see BCH drop out of the top ten cryptos before LTC.
Full disclose I have investments in LTC.

In fairness to Ver, his arguments for BCash were compelling, especially for people new to the space. I don't think that's the case anymore though.

You're looking too closely at the micro movements of bitcoin day to day.
Look at what happened in December, afterwards you would want a healthy correction and that is exactly what we are seeing. We've had three weeks of consolidation and it would not hurt to see more of it.
The most concerning thing is that, while Bitcoin has remained stable, crypto market cap continues to go up, dumping into alt-coins that people don't understand, and most of which have no purpose of existing.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:00:54

@_date: 2017-12-30 18:42:08
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:58:28


No, the opposite happened. Bitcoin was spoken about as if it were massively adopted, but the network and infrastructure are not ready.
The problem is actually Bitcoin itself. It's not user friendly, it has high fees, it's slow, and it's increasingly volatile in the future. 
The good news here is that all those problems can be fixed and Bitcoin might actually be ready for some level of adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:38:27
Bitcoin is a global currency, just saying

@_date: 2017-12-20 22:38:46
Problem is that these networks want a specialist to speak on crypto. Ver happens to speak well on the subject and his quarrels with Bitcoin appear valid to the average person.
Slow transactions, high fees. This resonates with people who don't understand what crypto is.
Bitcoin is synonymous with Bitcoin Cash to most people who follow mainstream media. 
Thankfully that generation will be dead soon and instead we can look to pull-requests for information on how our currencies are evolving.

I agree that maybe our kids will use Bitcoin, or something like it, but it doesn't make sense investing dollars in open-source technology in the first place. 
It would make sense to invest in the companies integrating with Bitcoin as a payment network, or the companies using block chains. But this is often done in the form of questionable tokens.

Edit: One other thing, I wouldn't discard Reddit's opinion on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is to succeed, it's young people who need to be willing to adopt it. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:40:05
A hard fork of Bitcoin will kill it at this point.
Same with Ether and BCash. The concept of creating money from thin air does not settle well with anyone who doesn't have something to gain.
Edit: I'm talking about the optics of the situation for new adopters. If there is a wean in confidence about Bitcoin's future, the market dies. I promise you. Save my comment.

Agree about consensus being achievable. All I'm saying is the optics look really bad. For Bcash, there were no optics because nobody was watching.
Imagine the headlines on CNBC or any MSM outlet. At a moment where BTC is finally gaining confidence in the public eye, a move like this could eliminate hard earned trust.

Gab's content policy is to follow the laws of the United States. None of the things you listed there are illegal.
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:10:47
Sorry I don't fully understand your argument. Could you rephrase it?
My point is that Gab and Bitcoin enable users to operate without prosecution from private organizations. Gab, while centralized, essentially has a 'hands-off' approach. If we had a decentralized social media platform, the same type of hateful speech would exist.
I respect Gab's content policy because they recognize it's not their purview to determine which content is bigoted.

Is there a stable coin that is also private? That would have decent value. One tied to USD and maybe one tied to Gold. Is that possible?
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:47:08


It happened and is happening now. It also was happening in 2013. I know because I used it and have continued to use it, albeit infrequently.
The problem arises when people make the argument that Bitcoin will replace the traditional banking system. In theory you can make an argument on why that is good, or necessary. But it will not happen and there is no incentive for it to happen.
But again, Bitcoin has a use-case regardless of what the USD value is. It did ten years ago, and it does today.
@_date: 2018-03-28 01:08:44
Why not? Perfectly valid usecase for Bitcoin.
OP, from what I can tell pretty much any wallet will support this. Did you encounter an error with one of the wallets?

Joking aside, ask your patient if he is trading money. I don't think it's a harmful addiction if he follows the market and/or participates in forums, even if done frequently. If channeled correctly, who knows, it could lead to an interest in programming.
If he is compulsively trading currencies then yes I honestly think it's basically the same as a gambling addiction.

and if it's in the title, you know it's true

Yes they and many other banks changed their policy.
I understand that's it's credit, so it's not _your_ money. But banks purposely don't provide developers tools to connect you to savings or chequing accounts.
eTransfer has made things better in the last few years, but it is a 1 to 1 platform and can't be integrated into another application.
I don't like the idea that banks collectively decided to ban the purchase of something.
You can circumvent it through an arduous wire transfer on Quadrigacx. I would actually recommend Quadrigacx over Coinbase as it's a Canadian company. You can do eTransfers after being verified.

One of those subreddits, like the coin itself, is a copy of the other.

Let's be honest, that was a wtf moment for everyone. But I doubt it will ever happen again.

Remember how Facebook died when mom and dad registered? Yeah.

Wait, so there isn't an overhead to credit card transactions? Didn't think you could send 1 cent via credit card to any merchant.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:42:37
Out of all answers, this is the most irrelevant.

Is this the same type of humor from Rick Morty? Aka, not at all funny.

New investors wouldn't buy altcoins. 
We are seeing all the old investors jump back into the market.

Think of it this way: Trust is expensive. It's paid in the form of unbias electricity instead of people and organizations.
As an aside, this planet's potential to generate more electricity is astonishing.

I have no idea what either of you just said but I love it, keep it up.
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:25:21
Are they? I really haven't seen much negative from them except some ignorance. They regularly have Tom Lee on and dedicate entire segments to Bitcoin. They also have Bitcoin in their ticker...
Perhaps you are sensitive to criticism of Bitcoin and the market.

It may not be Bitcoin, but there is a problem that needs a solution.
Banks do not provide simple methods to pay people in other countries. Banks need to work with other banks to implement a global payment network. 
The technology used to send payments globally through the banking system is decades old, difficult to use, and requires many intermediaries. 
The globe is connected and the demand for global payments is now. I can install an app on my phone, fund it with BTC from my bank account, then send and receive money to anyone, anywhere through a network that I trust.

Seems like there is nearly zero correlation between traditional stocks and Bitcoin. A year ago I thought that if the stock market experienced a correction, Bitcoin would do well. That hasn't been the case though.
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:09:17
Same, I'm so happy to see 0-5% growth per week and be confident it's not a pump and dump like BCash is experiencing.
Unpopular opinion but I'd rather see Bitcoin at $9k levels well into May.
@_date: 2018-04-28 04:19:43
Don't be worried. If you don't get it, I'll send you $40 CAD of BTC myself.
Edit: Btw, 40 CAD is like 5 pence

I just mean it's irrelevant because it doesn't explain anything. Supply and demand are always acting forces in capitalism. Unfortunately they're unsatisfactory answers to explain anything beyond that.

I want to hear him say this on CNBC

The last few months we've seen organic looking growth for the first time since the bubble. This is really encouraging.

No, I was around during Mt Gox. Which, as you know, was an exchange. What happened with Mt Gox said nothing about crypto currencies. 
The problem I'm describing is creating tokens out of thin air followed by market manipulation by just a few people (due to low liquidity).
Unless you think it's coincidental that all crypto assets mirror each other :)
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:36:39
I used to think this. 
The problem is you're trying to make Bitcoin as money analogous to USD as money. It's not like that.
Bitcoin is not a sole player in the future of money.
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:01:40
True but as a deflationary, capped currency there is a strong incentive to hold. 
Also you could make an argument that those who accumulated the most Bitcoin likely did so by merely being first adopters. Their wealth is not measured by any effort.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:50:17
BCH, SV fork destroyed any credibility crypto had.

Wealth inequality will be insane if Bitcoin ever goes anywhere.

Why wouldn't you buy an ETF instead? Stock markets are down this year, much better investment. There is a good chance Bitcoin goes to zero at this point.

Do not buy a hardware wallet if you're only going to have $100 on it.

These type of upticks are not organic. We have seen this dozens of times in the last few months. Its always followed by a new ATL.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:33:59
I literally said that.

Right, because r/bitcoin is so influential.
