Exactly, I trade cryptos and stocks, started out with 600 bucks. It’s been a crazy bumpy ride. I have about 3k now split between my crypto trading account and two stock trading accounts. Honestly the crypto account, I could lose it all and not really care...which will probably end up being the most successful as a result lol.

And scanners?

The crypto world desperately needs a good scanner. Basically you input settings to scan for and stuff that meets those parameters pop up. Basically like trade ideas for stocks...
So for example I’d like to scan for 
1. Price movement: new high of day
2. Greater than 100k volume or whatever
3. Price range .10 - 5.00 USD
Then any cryptos that have made a new high of day, with that volume, in that price range will pop up as they come.

It’s so cool reading all of the stories of success from cryptocurrency. I wish I had the capital to take advantage of the situation! I bought 200$ worth of bitcoin at like 4K, sold at 8k, just because it’s such a small amount, it’s insignificant. 
It’s crazy to think, you could basically go in with every penny you have on every dip and be doing amazing.

BALLS, really though...why not? You could always just claim bankruptcy. Not something I would do, but in such a debt driven world, this isn't even a big deal.
