Super smart early adopters made a fuckton of money off figuring out all the hard shit before places like Coinbase and Binance made it “easy” for “the normal guy” - fact is, the huge swell of popularity of crypto that primarily drives the value up comes from the millions of normal guys getting in the easy way, not from you handful of nerds that know how to buy the hard way without an exchange.  I made plenty of money buying on exchanges, fees included. Are they high? Yes. Insane? No. How do we know? Because the market can bear it.
Stand outside 7-11 and scorn people for wasting money on the high fees of transacting there. Convenience commands a premium and always has, for that exact reason. The more exchanges make, the happier you should be. It means more people are on board, and that can only be positive for crypto prices.

I'm the OP and I can promise you I am telling the truth. I did not account for Coinbase fees or slight rounding but dollar cost averaging smooths out the bumps. Even the very big bumps. I don't watch BTC daily or even weekly - I just set up an automated buy every 2 weeks back in Nov 2013 and I'm now breaking even. For accuracy - I have 3.77 BTC now. In order for throwaway to prove I'm not a liar, (s)he would need to take into account the amount of BTC purchased and the conversion rate at that time for every single buy I made, which wasn't done. I do know that a couple of my automatic bi-weekly purchases were made when BTC was below $500 which helped a lot.

You referring to me? I'm just some random dude. I don't come on reddit every day, just think it's cool. I do not work for, not am I affiliated with any BTC services. Just a fan of common sense and honesty.

Great point. Is there a service you use for Dollar value averaging or just a formula you made for yourself and a recurring calendar notification to make  buys manually?

Thanks - that's it exactly.

That’s a cool gizmo - where can I get one?

My ex-wife was super pissed off at me when I bought 1.00 BTC for $1,000 and change. My wife was thrilled when I sold it for $18k last year.

Wait, 12/31/19? Did you mean 12/31/18?

If A owes B and B owes C and C owes D and D owes A, it all cancels out. 
Every country should just send a delegate to a worldwide accountant summit armed with everyone each nation owes and they should all spend a couple hours canceling everything out, then go to a local bar and get drunk together and take pictures and put it on Instagram. 
The world will be better off after that.
