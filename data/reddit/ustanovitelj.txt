On the other hand, if they didn't require you to change password or anything after a hack... So while I agree it's inconvenient, forcing change is the right thing to do, whether actually urgently needed or not

You're pushing your point without pause, even though it's obvious you'll not get a simple answer outside of the publicly posted one from blockstream. Why? Honest interest, to score a point, or maybe you think you'll dismantle a conspiracy that's bad for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:40:05
Bingo. Not upgrading internet exposed mission crit software is usually a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:51:48
Your enemy's enemy? Or keep your enemies closer? Both common concepts, and complementary. Don't call a conspiracy when there are normal (more boring) explanations available.

Well, this is why at least 50% of hashpower has to be segwit aware to avoid chain split. And miners hate splits.
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:38:53
Segwit txs are nonstandard, meaning they won't be relayed by old nodes, but will be accepted once in a block. Only risk is buggy/troll blocks it seems, for which the border patrol segwit validating mode is needed for miners to not risk loosing money

But OPs post is already working to tease out the lunatics. Step 2 filter the crazies. Step 3 profit... from astronomically improved peace of mind

There's also the option to mount the HDD on a fast Linux box and sync fully, then shutdown unmount and restart on the pi. Getting the block chain from a torrent is likely also possible for further initial speedup
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:20:29
Diff adjustment happens every second week on average, adjusting difficulty so each block should take 10min on average.

Maybe Coinbase. They can't calculate fees properly since a few months.
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:47:18
Larry Lessig figured this one out. Code isn't law. Even TOC and software licenses are weaker than law. That's why he went after congress instead of writing up legal cases.

Have you looked at how the fake news is received and reacted to in both subs?
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:47:39
This guy knows his quiche
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:35:47
Definitely not short and simple. If it was, then libconsensus would be more than halfway finished by now and new coding volunteers wouldn't be asked to help copy pasting stuff into libconsensus and start writing tests to make inroads towards using libconsensus exclusively

Huh? If UASF with flag day, BU miners (and hack nodes) could try to troll BU miners to fork off, or they can do it on purpose (51%attack). Or what did you mean?
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:09:24
As would be expected from non paid, likely non professional moderators. Do they also sometimes not go far enough? If yes, then the can be solved by letting users (eh, rbtc warriors too!) repeal moderation events. I'd like it to be public though who repealed what, to find sockpuppets and feed them my private autofilter's blacklist (WIP)
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:40:32
1. Bugfix appears in GitHub 2. BU nodes start disappearing 3. Todd tweets 4. BU damage control
Now if BU has auto update, the right way would be 
1. Inform major miners about quick fix, 2. Push mandatory update, 3. Publish advisory 4. Publish bugfix 5. Build protections to prevent whole class of crashes (invalid RPC messages) 6. BUIR 7 political spins/lies
Though step 7 is probably no longer needed, since bug was cleanly handled
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:50:59
The users, who can short BTU and long BTC, then sit back and sip a nice drink waiting for BU nodes to drop like flies
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:27:00
So, did 40% of hashpower go offline when BU nodes crashed? Or were the hashpower maybe running core, stayed online, and just faked the BU support signaling?

You mean you have to change www. to np.? PITA for sure, since it could just be done automatically.

Are you calling stratum servers nodes?
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:38:05


Yes. This worries me in BU/EC and re. block size:
 - change from fixed consensus to emergent
 - block withholding risks, ping and​ packet drop issues with 2/4/8/20MB blocks
 - centralisation trend
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:47:50
Sorry, shouldn't have asked you to fell yourself above. I counter your tactic for stalling a difficult position of type "please spend more time explaining, and (hopefully?) lay some trap I can use against you" with leaving you to self educate, for now. Sorry for the inconvenience.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:13:46
Likely a troll begging to be banned, to return martyred to rbtc

And sad
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:09:25
The only serious option. Antpool's empty blocks are probably from times when their SPY mining is working well, or alternatively, when their distributed block optimizing (stratus?) servers are unavailable.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:28:08
Maybe automod learnt to dislike Twitter

Which of the two (rhetorical) questions do you read as "claims"? (Do you want a Wiktionary Link with that?)
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:16:16
You can build both decentralized and centralised (for more efficiency, gaining the best of two worlds?) on top of decentralized. Similar to how  asynchronous programming goes on top of asynchronous, and still allowing synchronous wrappers to be used to make programming easier.

Your"logic"just fell off a cliff
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:52:02
Which pool?
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:54:04
Timeframes make a difference. Because of "luck" a longer period of blocks is more reliable. But less up to date.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:46:11
Nodes, or hashpower? Where do you see this?

Wanna give economical incentive with fee bonuses to segwit miners?
@_date: 2017-04-23 21:18:41
Yep. The roundtable thing feels like a joke. As if computer users aren't capable of choosing which app to download or which blockchain to transact on no big-important-guy have said what to do.
@_date: 2017-04-23 20:58:32
Eh? What's stopping hk agreement miners from using that code? Your statement appears insincere
@_date: 2017-04-23 21:11:14
And it was likely on order by Jihan or some govt officials, who can't risk LTC leading the way

Ad hominem or scam busting is maybe not relevant right here right now? If you disagree, you can simply write that. Or call out falsehoods. Or "that sounds like shilling to me" and harvest sweet karma

Above all, it'd be shorter: "terries have no say. Pride is waste"
But why are these seemingly Chinese males against decentralisation?

If not, then why even sell a single one? They're risking tear downs, patent infringement and other suits, and take on warranty and compliance and documentation costs. My conclusion is that they need to sell hardware - or they are beyond stupid.
