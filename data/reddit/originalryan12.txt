God you are so right though. Explaining even the very basics of cryptocurrencies above a basic coinbase interface level and even explaining how that works to my parents was pretty hard.
It does need to be more user friendly so badly, not even just the exchanges I think those can be what they are, but the entire process is not simple to a new user.... It just isn't. I still know people for example who weeks in were still using software wallets and Changelly to switch coins around their portfolio losing tons of money not checking exchange rates and fees vice precision buying on an exchange. Yes for long term holders it's not a huge deal and yes it's technically safer than an exchange but they didn't even know all that.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:00:13
I don't think they should have to declare it PUBLICLY that's a little far. This is one they'll need to think through. Maybe a cryptocurrency investor should not be in charge of cryptocurrency regulation. Or figure out the regulations right now and stop trying to screw with it, that will solve the whole problem.

I'd been cashing out with specific amounts at profit milestones too, so I'm still up even if it goes to zero (which it will not). 
I even guaranteed insurance for the buy in's of the people I brought in until they reached a certain profit point at which I'd give them the option to take back ROI or stay in, so I'd have peace of mind not screwing them over by bringing them in, and even giving them back their money I'm STILL in the green.

I hear you. It's an odd thing.... I really want to bring cryptocurrencies up because I want to spread the wealth but I don't want the bubble/pyramid scheme argument with someone who has yet to hear the word blockchain but are somehow an expert on it.
The 5 close friends I have gotten into it are up between 20% and 400% in less than 2 weeks though, and myself 5 figures in a month while cashing out at intervals I set on purpose in case it was a bubbly bubble. Zero skin in the game right now. 
Honestly people can argue all they want, those who know, know. Yes it will go down once the hype subsides, no, I do not care, but I didn't pay for my trip home to South America for Christmas... And I truly honestly want good people to put even a tiny bit in and take advantage of the phenomenon but don't want to come across wrong.... Can anyone relate I don't even know.

Technically, if all idiots stop selling, the market price will not move since no transactions will lower the value. If a million people try to buy a current 1 dollar coin at a penny but nobody sells at a penny then the value is not a penny it's a dollar.

I've always thought Bitcoin would eventually simply be the standard by which everything else is measured, an unchanging value. As in eventually a banana costing 10 Satoshi will always be 10 Satoshi for hundreds of years, varying only by regional demand, but never varying due to inflation or fluctuation of Bitcoin. That would go for everything else including other currencies. If this becomes the case, it really would have a main use case only as a store of value, not as much a day to day currency, and the measure of inflation rate of other currencies would be precisely measured by their relation to BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-31 11:44:29
Agree. I commented a while ago about how banks lend out over 30 times the money they actually have, literally creating money, and how our inflation is only curbed by debt, not by not printing too much money. I was informed that the bank lending is healthy because the credit system is how we afford new businesses and large purchases. Cool. Well with bitcoin credit in the future you could do that without inflation or currency devaluation once it becomes stable.
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:21:49
There is a video explaining the banking system and how they can loan out over 30 times the money they actually have.... Literally create money by credit. Then looking at how stocks although representing a portion of a company, the value hasn't a damn thing to do with the value of the company but just what people kind of buy it for based on confidence. After understanding that, a monetary system based on the value of a limited supply of a digital super secure currency.... Makes a ton of sense. The value now doesn't matter, it's only just beginning, eventually it will be global and stable and that's obvious.

@_date: 2019-08-16 19:59:28
I've always thought the day to day value is really irrelevant. Bitcoin is the best candidate to be the high value stable reference currency, by which all other currencies and cryptocurrencies gage their value against as they fluctuate based on their use cases and demand. This is sorely needed, as the most stable currencies today are honestly not that stable. Bitcoin doesn't need to be the fastest or the most flexible. It just needs to be the most secure valuable reliable store of value. Eventually stability won't be able issue.

Ok I'm going to only reply once more in this thread, hopefully everyone understands supply and demand factors into actual price and I said that.  Without demand supply doesn't matter, and vice versa. I'm saying there currently is no asset that is a standard by which everything else is measured in value, more or less whether supply or demand dictates it, but that value fluctuation is currently not single sided as fiat devalues at an imperfectly measurable rate.  If Bitcoin became that measure, then barring any change in supply and demand the price would remain stable indefinitely, and fluctuations in supply and demand would be the only change and perfectly reflected and measured.

The national debt is just about the total GDP of this entire country. Think about that for a second. Some countries have wild inflation by printing money, but instead of going crazy printing, it's put off into a massive massive national debt. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it then seem like the value of the dollar is all smoke and mirrors, if the only reason it's so strong is because of borrowing instead of printing, with a budget deficit that's insane and only fixable by politicians getting their heads out of their asses and conceding to a proper budget.....

If Bitcoin becomes the standard value by which everything else is measured, it really doesn't matter if any is inaccessible. It would be like gold being the perfect standard which it isn't because we don't know how much is still in the ground and the mining rate changes, but let's say we knew exactly how much was in the ground that we couldn't reach it or knew when we would. Then we'd know the real precise scarcity anyhow and know we'll never exceed that. There's a great value in that, and we already have that with Bitcoin.

Took me a long time to realize that BTC itself was what I wanted to accumulate. Why? One reason is it's what is used other than fiat to buy all other coins in every exchange everywhere. It's literally above them. It is what all cryptocurrency is measured against. You cannot say that about anything else. If you have time to watch your coins 24/7 then altcoins can make you more on swings sure. But good luck with that....

With this market if you are proficient in trading and moving value between exchanges.... BTC is not the place to have your money when BTC is going up in a large swing ironically, so I agree with you.
Since most altcoins use BTC as their current gage of value as the trading pair, not USD... When they go up and are worth more in BTC over a time period AS bitcoin is also rising at a moderate rate, the total rise in USD terms is exponential. That is why in a fast rising BTC period if you know what you're doing, you're in alts.
