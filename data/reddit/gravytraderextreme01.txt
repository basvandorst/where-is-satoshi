Just so I'm clear: $6.5k is the current floor (it's only possible to dip under this iron-clad support level in monetary terms), and we'll see $7k by tonight... ET I'm guessing?

Did it?

Emerging markets include (hopefully) profitable companies that generate economic activity. Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu... these are all risky companies, but they have customers, income, etc.
Precious metals... eh, it's almost as dumb to hold gold in your IRA (in my opinion).
Bitcoin... is it going to be around in 40 years when you're ready to dip into your IRA? It doesn't create any profit, the only way it increases in value is when somebody else is willing to pay something more for it, and why are you adding currencies to your IRA? Are you also adding Euros?
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:23:00
The floor is still at $6.5k, so I guess that must mean we're living in the basement.

@_date: 2018-08-22 20:06:43
Lol... okay, so the small, regional co-ops running the dams are limiting new mining operations hooking into their grid because they're protecting Big Coal? WTF?
Read up on the topic and you'll discover that the communities living in these areas don't want to take on the expenditure of supplying massive new infrastructure to supply the mining operations with power, without any guarantee that they're going to be there next month if bitcoin prices crash.
When you have steady predictable population growth it's easy to scale up your power production at a planned rate. Not so easy when it suddenly doubles overnight, and then crashes, and then doubles again based on the market whims of bitcoin.
This isn't just limited to bitcoin mining... one of the most popular bitcoin mining areas in WA had an Alcoa aluminum smelter move into the area because of cheap hydro power.

@_date: 2018-08-25 19:03:09
supply cannot be manipulated = technically true, but what difference does it make if the price is affected by Tether's endless quantitive easing?
no physical storage = eh... not really true unless you memorize your keys?
securely = also eh... it's much less risky keeping your money in a bank than keeping your trezor buried under your birdbath

So you're fine holding an asset that can be arbitrarily dumped by the big players whenever they choose?
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:17:11
Well, perhaps in monetary terms the floor is $5,000... but the real floor is $6,500.
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:33:22
So you're saying never again under $6,500, dude?
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:47:44

Ah, but dude, you said "never again...", that seems to suggest it will never reach $5,XXX again... which of course, it did for some length of time. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:06:18
Never below $6k again, right guys?
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:53:12
I've thought about this too, and surprisingly... even if Tether is 100% unbacked and "worthless", I could still see people treating it like $1USD just for convenience.

Tether pump
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:48:26
In a hypothetical world where tether no longer exists, many of my concerns with bitcoin do go away. I still don't think it's smart to add it to your retirement account, but whatever, go for it if you want.
Right now you can't talk about bitcoin without talking about tether since they're so closely intertwined, though. We know the run up to $1,000 was manipulation, and there's strong evidence that the run to $20,000 was manipulation as well.
Without tether my best guess for bitcoin's price is between $10 and $100. If tether ever implodes we'll find out for sure.
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:48:18
Renewables do work, but fly by night bitcoin mining operations are also putting huge strain on publicly subsidized systems that were designed to expand and adapt to slow, predictable growth. This is why areas that are popular for bitcoin mining (because of their cheap, subsidized power) are also pushing back against mining operations.

Nobody I know in real life uses Bitcoin... they all know about it because of the mania in December, but it's really become a big joke now outside of these echo chambers.
Tech improvements don't really have an affect on price... Adoption, might, I guess? But again, nobody is using it... even shops and restaurants on those "bitcoin accepted here" directories have stopped accepting it, either because it was a huge pain to deal with, or nobody actually paid with BTC so they just kinda forgot about it. 
Bitcoin needs a killer app that makes people think, OF COURSE! This is so obvious. Why did I ever do it the other way?
You can't talk about decentralization, being your own bank, the evils of inflation to normal people and expect them to care what you're saying. If you have to prime your mark with a dozen articles and youtube videos before they "get it", then it's never going to go anywhere.
Right now bitcoin is kinda useless aside from speculation. Payments are way easier using something like Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, etc. and there are approximately zero shops or businesses actually accepting it (even the "Bitcoin Cafe" rofl).
In my view, the only thing that will increase BTC price now is: 1. Tether induced manipulation, or 2. another massive bull run that eclipses the 20k high... adding another layer of bag hodlers to the bottom of the pyramid. 
If 1. starts to happen, it could trigger 2. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 05:12:08

That ship has sailed, man... If you weren't buying bitcoin at $1 there's realistically no chance to do this.
What's the upside for BTC? Let's say it hits $20k again. Wheee..... 4x profits. Nice little sum, but not enough to retire on. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:57:02
What's your personal moon price?
@_date: 2018-08-17 01:16:48
Hmm good question - If depends on the situation: for it to get down to $100-500 things would be pretty dire. I might YOLO $100, but I wouldn't buy anything substantial.
In my opinion institutional investors are a meme to keep the hodlers hopeful, ETF will never happen as long as Tether is a thing, and the crypto space around BTC is starting to become disillusioned. 
Just my thoughts.

@_date: 2018-08-13 17:45:31
I think the danger is, when tether finally pops, what happens to BTC? We know the run up to $1,000 was manipulated. Who's to say the run up to $20,000 wasn't manipulated the same way? What if BTC is actually worth about $20 given its utility.
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:55:45
Still sticking to that "never again under 6k" prediction?
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:23:35
If it goes below 6k, will you leave Edit: or head over to and publicly admit your love for Roger Ver?
@_date: 2018-08-17 19:02:53
or sell off while BTC is still worth $6,500. Better to sell now than a year from now when it's $1,000.

Thanks for keeping the hope alive. You're doing good work. When reality hits (and let's be honest, it's hitting HARD), I love that we can still keep our spirits up with what - on its face - may seem like naive, wide-eyed hope and belief in an asset that's eroding daily. Some days it's all that keeps us going, though... thanks for being part of the community!

How can we pump to 6.5 when 6.5 is already the base?
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:45:00
If we're treating this as an investment, maybe we need to compare it to the value of the equity markets? And then somehow adjust for all the wash trading on USDT exchanges.
@_date: 2018-08-17 19:05:52
I'm pretty sure he's the troll that was always talking about the quilt shop in Iowa accepting LN.
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:32:22
I agree with everything you're saying. Bitcoin does seem to be the only decent use for blockchains. The main problem I have is: what's the point, if you basically have Tether acting as a central bank, printing USDT that may or may not be backed with it's finger on the scale?
You have Bitcoin which is hard money. Then you have this second layer of Tether which is about the softest money you can imagine, and has massive influence over Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 18:55:02
We've had a tremendous bull run the last few days. All of my charts show $12,500. Not sure where these naysayers are getting their data from.

I would be worried about the dip, but luckily the floor is $6,500 so there's nothing to worry about!
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:43:20
Yep, that's why we've had endless posts about submitting positive comments to the SEC. After the first rejection, the tune started to change to "eh, who needs them!" after it was obvious that an ETF isn't happening anytime soon.

Nope - $12.5k according to my charts
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:41:06
Imagine how much energy bitcoin would use if it replaced banking entirely.
Also, a lot of bitcoin mining power (in the U.S.) comes from publicly subsidized, cheap hydro power. It's renewable but it also puts huge strain on systems that were designed to adapt to slow, well predicted growth. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 19:03:25

This is the problem with deflationary currencies. Nobody wants to spend them, everyone just wants to hodl. 
With mild, predictable inflation, you're incentivized to spend money instead of hoarding it under your mattress (even if that's to buy investments like stocks, bonds, whatever...)
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:39:54
Makes the Lira seem like a safe haven

Well there goes 6k again
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:40:09
I see your point - however - I see apps like Apple Pay, Venmo, etc. using digital money (USD) taking over rather than cryptocurrencies. The EU already has SEPA which makes transactions between bank accounts nearly instant. Online-only bank accounts are becoming more popular (like Ally).
Bitcoin has the problem of, at heart, being a deflationary currency which means that for mass adoption we need a MAJOR change to how the world economy works. Can you see consumerism dying? People hodling their coins while spending money only on what they TRULY need? Eh - maybe - but I doubt it.
Optimizing existing systems has the huge advantage of working within the framework our economy is built on. I mean, what, we'd need to abolish the federal reserve? Make banks obsolete? How's this going to affect the stock market? My guess is people aren't going to throw their money into stocks when they can see better returns just hodling. The U.S. tech sector alone has generated an obscene amount of wealth, is this now going to shift over to China?
Anyway - my point is - this would require a MAJOR shift that has very very very limited appeal outside of certain ancap and libertarian circles. Realistically it's not going to gain traction.
@_date: 2018-08-19 21:26:02
Now that we're \_actually\_ at 6.5k, what's the next price prediction?

It's not as simple as just plugging in a power cord. In order to supply these big miners with electricity, there's quite a bit of infrastructure that needs to be built. When there's no guarantee that these miners are still going to be there next month. There's a potential for the local community to be left holding the bag after creating new infrastructure etc. that goes unused. 
Also, it's not as simple as simply raising prices. Since these are publicly funded co-ops, they can't just charge different industries different rates without changing the rules. If prices go up, that also means that prices for electricity to thousands of homes increase as well. Again, not something that's going to make these miners popular with the locals. 
I love the irony of using publicly funded electricity to mine your libertarian utopian cryptocurrency though.

Legit question: more than 51% of mining takes place in China, right? All of their traffic is passed through the great firewall. Wouldn't this give China, more or less, complete control of bitcoin if they wanted?

I feel like there are some good use cases for bitcoin like you mentioned. What bugs me is that these benefits worked just as well (maybe even better) when bitcoin was in the $20-$100 range. The actual use cases of BTC don't justify the price we're currently at. It's all just speculators and whales using smoke and mirrors to somehow justify the valuation we're at.
@_date: 2018-08-17 21:31:25

If you can manipulate the price of bitcoin by creating/destroying tethers, it doesn't matter if there's a hard cap on bitcoin itself.

Yup! They're partnering with Microsoft, too, so you'll probably be able to use LN at any Microsoft store as well. 
Something people aren't talking about is the other companies Starbucks owns, too... Like Seattle's Best Coffee, Teavana, etc. They will most likely be accepting LN soon as well.
Wonder how long it'll be before Apple starts accepting LN in their retail stores?

The time to get excited is when we see actual, organic growth (like from Nov-Dec of last year)... But when it's flat, and then suddenly there's a HUGE 5 minute spike for no reason, you've got to ask if this is just somebody manipulating the market.
@_date: 2018-08-20 02:47:35
That's exactly the point... When you're investing in stocks or bonds, you're doing something productive with your money. You're not just stuffing it under your mattress (which is same as buying bitcoin).
Now ask how many people would buy things with a percentage of their retirement account.

A Turk with 80% Lira, 10% gold, and 10% USD would have even less volatility. 
Obviously the charts still look pretty good since we have the huge increase in 2017-2018. Once the bubble finishes bursting, the mania finally settles down, and reality sets in, zooming out on the BTC chart isn't going to be any better.

This is why we need Tether to go bust... Then we might actually have some market fundamentals based on the actual use and utility of bitcoin. Until then the price can easily be set by a very small number of people. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:01:36
Is 6.5k the base regardless of the actual price? So 6.5k could be the base at 6k, 5.5k, 5k?

Just because energy is renewable doesn't mean that it doesn't impact the environment and the communities supplying that energy. It doesn't sound like you're from the U.S. so you might not be familiar with how our energy systems work here. Some of the most popular places to mine bitcoin are in communities supplied with cheap, subsidized, hydroelectric power due to their location. These communities have co-ops who manage and maintain the power infrastructure in the area. It's for these co-ops to provide everyone in the area with reliable, cheap service when the population growth (and therefore power usage) expands at a predictable rate. However, what is happening now is large bitcoin mining operations are locating to these communities due to their cheap power. This means that the co-op needs to build new infrastructure (at their expense) to supply these mining operations with lots and lots of power. There is no guarantee that these miners will still be here next month, let alone 10 years from now, so it is very difficult for the co-ops to plan their infrastructure accordingly. This is why so many of these communities have either restricted bitcoin mining or temporarily frozen new mining applications while they figure out how to handle this problem.
So, no, it's not that these power companies are in cahoots with Big Coal to keep you addicted to that sweet, sweet, smog producing coal plant. It's that bitcoin miners are using these communities due to their cheap, government subsidized power and aren't seen as valuable, long-term members of the local community. They produce little to no local jobs, they're a drain on local resources, and if bitcoin crashes, they're packing up and leaving. 
One of the funnies anecdotes I've heard is a private plane from China landing in Wenatchee (which is the community where most of these bitcoin miners operate) and asking the volunteers at the dam's visitors center how to purchase electricity.
