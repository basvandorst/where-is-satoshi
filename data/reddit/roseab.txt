In my humble opinion, don't deprive your business of Valuable achievements in International market.Almost all serious VPN providers do accept major credit cards as well as bitcoin and other electronics money. Here are few tips that could help you reducing credit card fraud in your business: 
**Always ask for identification.**: You may ask for identification anytime you are presented with a credit card. Many cardholders even write "Ask for ID" on their cards to prevent unauthorized use.
**Require a credit card verification number on all purchases.** Referred to as a CVV (card verification value) or CVV2, this three-digit number is located on the back of every Visa and MasterCard.
**use an account verification system.** Known as AVS, this system checks on the billing address of the card to make sure that the zip code and other information matches.
Hope it could help.

Your VPN can see all traffic any data that is not encrypted just like your ISP can.
HTTPS connections will keep your username/passwords/content safe (even if you are not using a VPN), but not block the person running the VPN from seeing your DNS queries or what servers you're connecting to. They can see anything sent over HTTP, including stuff sent by browser plugins.
So You're just trading one chain of trust for another. Instead of trusting your current access point and their ISP, you're now trusting the VPN host and their ISP.

To the best of my knowledge, Hola injects ads on web pages. Please note that such Providers are more likely to log your activities and serve contextual ads while you're connected. They're also more likely to use your usage habits to tailor future ads to you, have fewer exit locations, and weak commitments to privacy so if logging and privacy are important to you, you may want to avoid them. 
Fortunately many reliable VPN providers support Bitcoin as well. Purevpn, PIA, cybergost are few well known brands among many others that almost have optimized severs for watching Netflix/Hulu from outside of US.
Hope it could help.
