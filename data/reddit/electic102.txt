You didn't miss anything. CMC is unable to capture the price when there is trade flurry's. That means when the price spikes high or low, they miss that. That is why they don't really show the 24HR high/low and that why the price seems flat out wrong when there is increased trade volume. 
Simply, the miss it because they are looking at tickers where as streaming sites look at the trades and can be more granular. Use [this](

Right, but the cycle is here again and this time there is cryptocurrency. It is another major economy having issues that can impact the price of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:44:03
The price is an aggregate of 40 exchanges, the global consensus price. We may add a grid below with individual exchanges. However, it is likely bitflyer has lower volume than most major exchanges for the coin you are looking at and the price is higher or lower than the other exchanges.

**Who uses it?**
It is used by professional crypto traders in the US (Wall St.), China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. They use it when they are on the go. 
**What is it used for?**
It is used to keep track of prices across 50+ exchanges, currency flows, news, reddit posts and to keep track of positions in realtime in a secure manner.
**What is unique about it?**
It is a killer UI. It has a built in FOREX engine. Also, it is secure by design. It doesn't use a 3rd party server, everying is done on device including the portfolio keeping you safe.
**Is there a telegram channel?**
Yes, visit

Well Chavez is dead. Maduro is his hand picked successor. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 09:09:48
Yes, the media does tell us that. However, Venezuela was in crisis long before the U.S. imposed sanctions. There have been food, medicine, and other shortages starting when Chavez was in running the place. 
So here we are, the world has had enough. So it has two options. One, military or Two, sanctions. Two is the best option to get the people to force him out without outside intervention. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 00:35:13
Agreed. But even in the downturn they should have had enough income coming in. These oil facilities all eventually shut down or could not be maintained. They even started importing oil...which is pretty shocking.
I agree, socialism has nothing to do with it. It is just someone came in and became a dictator. In fact, Chavez said a lot of things Trump says. He said don't trust the detractors. Don't trust the foreign firms and foreigners. He said don't trust the opposition party. People cheered. He plundered. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 09:45:19
The UN is ineffective because there are members on the security panel who will veto any intervention to keep things going as is. You know who those members are.
The US isn't perfect. However, these sanctions are a unified effort between a a dozen or so countries to try and get Maduro to leave. To reiterate, this country had food shortages before sanctions. So I don't get why you are advocating for doing nothing here. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:30:30
The country is already running on USD. People are not taking credit cards anyway because the base currency is Bolivars. So it is USD and BTC is out for most daily transactions because of power.

A wallet is where you store bitcoin. And by wallet I am talking about a native wallet where you have the keys. Robinhood on the ohter hand allows you to buy bitcoin but doesn't allow you to send or receive it. That being said, I would recommend you buy bitcoin on an exchange, such as Coinbase, and send it to a wallet for safe keeping.

This is frankly just the beginning. 15k or even 20k by years is not that hard to believe. Here are my reasons why:
1. Currency protectionism is rising. We have China, US, India all now using their currencies to hurt each other over trade. This is very good for Bitcoin. It fucking validates Bitcoin's need and very existence.
2. Middle East Tensions. With the drone downing, we are going to see a tense posturing between powers in the area and also powers internationally. That is great for Bitcoin.
3. Tariffs. Tariffs suck and markets hate it. This is great for Bitcoin.
4. Softening Job Market. We are already seeing this in the US. That spells bad news for non-US economies as people move to more safer investments. Great news for Bitcoin.
Pretty sure the next 8-12 months are going to be really good for Bitcoin. !timecapsule BTC

If you want to sit here and wait 2 days so you can book your slot on MTV cribs, then you are going to be disappointed.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:13:09
This is insane! The yearly low on BTC was $3,152. This year alone you are looking at a 400% return if you bought it at the beginning of the year. No other investment is going to give you those types of returns and don't get me started on what your returns would have been if you bought it five years ago.
I think a lot of people just want to be rich INSTANTLY. It doesn't work that way. However, I think a lot of people are going to panic sell. Since these auto-update...when you search this thread five years from now and find it, I want you to see the number below in regards to the gain. Those could have been your gains.

@_date: 2019-06-28 10:02:35
I have been in BTC since 2016 and I have gone thru many gut wrenching crashes and honestly tried many tactics to trade BTC. However, the only one that has worked so far is incremental buying. It averages out any dips and is also less stressful. 
The truth is Bitcoin is a deflationary asset. They don't just keep minting them like central banks do with their currencies. That is why BTC is amazing. It's a transparent economic structure and it will always prioritize building value.
Four years ago it was trading near $300 and today it is trading near $12k. I don't know what it will trade in 5 years but these prices will seem very cheap. Come back to this thread in five years...let's see how it ages.
!timecapsule BTC
@_date: 2019-02-01 06:17:14
No. Hang on. So far in this market Bitcoin has proven to be the winner compared to other coins. That being said, I hope you have it in a hardware wallet and not sitting on an exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:49:16
You could use Bitcoin to do swaps between central banks using a 3rd party currency. In this case Bitcoin.


I would say a couple of years ago banks were probably thinking to have some sort of pegged stablecoin but now I think central banks are going to keep something of an alternative to gold and that most likely is Bitcoin. Why? Because it is completely independent of the U.S.
 It also helps that the last five years has really proven that Bitcoin is a viable store of value over the long term even more so than gold.
The next few years will be interesting for sure. Even if a handful of banks have Bitcoin as a reserve then $11k is going to seem cheap in a few years. That's the path we're on!

@_date: 2018-11-25 11:02:50
I am not saying you are right or wrong. However, there are some other factors at play here. The first is that coins are also destroyed per day. People lose keys, people pass away, etc. A second factor that affects the price is exchanges. They create artificial supply. Just because X people hold coins on a particular exchange, doesn't mean exchange holds X coins. This artificial supply, along with any other instruments built about BTC create volatility. 
  
Worse, we take these low volume new exchanges are connected to our pricing sites and feed the panic. So unless we start ignoring new exchanges I doubt things will change...

Hi Everyone,
I am one of the lead devs for Bitcoin Tab. Bitcoin Tab delivers realtime streaming price, news, social and reddit posts, and code checkins from Bitcoin Core in every new tab for Google Chrome.
We wanted to thank everyone who gave us feedback over the last few versions. Here's what's new:
* Reminder: It is open source. You can grab the source code from GitHub [here](
* \[NEW\] New more compact header. We made the Bitcoin logo smaller so that more grids can fit on screen. Ideal for laptops.
* \[FIX\] GitHub code checkins didn't have the right visual badge.
* \[NEW\] All lightning repos are now represented in the code checkins grid. I know this is a huge deal for people to see development moving along, so if we forgot any repos please let us know.
* \[FIX\] Fix time ago stamps so they are more pronounced so you can see updates.
REQUEST: Do people want to see on-chain stats? Like fees, current transaction rates, nodes, etc? A few people suggested this but we need more feedback to see if people want this or not.
If you have feedback, please let us know. Every bit helps us!
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:27:58
The code is written in C++ and is really easy to understand if you take a look at the tests. The tests in a way help describe any function you might have questions about and how each function is expected to work.
Secondly, the code, and the activity of the Bitcoin Core team, is the most important fundamental any investor should look at. You can keep up with everything bitcoin [here]( and pay special attention to the "code checkins" section which streams the activity of the devs in realtime for Bitcoin and all lightning projects.

It's okay to have a difference of opinion. Sure, you can and should watch the whole thing. However, I found most of the answers of "why do we need Bitcoin" pretty weak when they were answered. It didn't instill a lot of confidence on why the government should embrace it and it re-enforced the view that this is a bad idea and will undermine the government's authority.

This is a completely bogus number and honestly how we got into this bear market to begin with. By focusing on market cap of which is a completely fictitious number. Literally alt-coins are self reporting how many coins they have in circulation and really can't be relied upon to be an indicator of market health.
Instead, focus on the progress a coin is making. Is the coin checkin in code? Are they growing community? Are they making partnerships? Is there adoption coming from other hardware and software vendors? Is the team churning? Is there cash to sustain operations?
