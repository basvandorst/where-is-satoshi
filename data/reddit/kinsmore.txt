That's a mitigation that prevents someone from snooping on the key on disk, but it's still stored in-memory in plaintext. If something gets root access (or can trick the application into spitting out chunks of it's own memory) then it's right there to be picked up.
But yeah, they cocked this one up good it seems.

I know they won't be phased out, but they are a hack right now for backwards compatibility, and they are less than ideal in many ways.
Bech32 is an upgrade in just about every way, and I have spent a lot of time and effort securing things and validating tools that use P2PKH addresses.
If i'm going to repeat that process, i want it to be with Bech32. And with lightning coming as well, hopefully Bech32 will be the address-of-choice to work with lightning easily.

Again, i'm not talking about cold storage. Cold storage is a great idea, but it has nothing to do with the conversation I was having, which is:
Encrypting a key on a server does not improve security at all. Because in order for that key to be usable, the server must have access to the key that encrypted the key. So there must be a plaintext copy of a key on the server.
Cold storage is the real "solution" to that problem. Or more accurately segregation and keyservers is the real solution. You put all your private keys on specialized servers who's only job is to release those keys when needed to other servers that can use them, then instantly delete them from memory.
And then taken a step further, you segregate further keys into a "cold storage" that you need a physical person to unlock from a vault and enter by hand in order to spend larger amounts.
But all of that has nothing to do with what I was speaking to, which is that simply encrypting a key with another key doesn't improve security, and in fact it actually makes it worse as now you have 2 keys that you need to securely store, and twice the attack vector in decryption code.
You need to read what people are saying, you are just talking to yourself here. You brought up "hot wallets" when nobody was talking about hot wallets, and you brought up cold storage as a solution to a problem that was not in this conversation. Imagine if I replied with:


You'd be confused as hell right? Because that has nothing to do with the conversation we are having, you are just saying random stuff...

[here is the form you'd need to fill out](
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:29:56


I said that... keyservers are a common thing, but you do know that the keyserver stores the key in plaintext right? And the keyserver is still vulnerable to exploits that could cause it to sign fraudulent transactions... Again, there are even more mitigations for those kinds of things, but then we are getting into system architectures, which I do all day at work and don't really want to do in my off hours...


Holy shit you're crazy! It's probably a good thing I won't get any more replies to you... You started an argument about something I wasn't talking about, all the while ignoring what you wrote and just responding with what you think I would write... And how the hell would anything I say protect my own assets? Like jesus christ...
It's kind of funny actually, you are right, but you are arguing with nobody. I'm not saying you are wrong about anything you have said, and I actually agreed with you in every comment, but I'm pointing out that you are bringing up all of this for no reason. It has nothing to do with my first comment, which is that in order to have a private key that can be used to sign transactions, it MUST be in plaintext at some point. And if it's encrypted, it doesn't help anything, because the key to that encryption must then be in plaintext on the server in order for it to be used.
I didn't talk about cold storage, I didn't talk about keyservers, I didn't talk about if they were right or wrong about the way they setup their services, I just said that "why didn't they encrypt the key" is a dumb sentence, and that simply "encrypting the key" wouldn't help...
Go take a nap dude, you sound like you really need one.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:21:42


If the private key needs to be used, then whatever is needed to "decrypt" it must be in plaintext on the server. Whether it's a symmetric or asymmetric key, it doesn't matter.
The server needs access to a way to decrypt it, and if malware gets on the server, it too has access to that key just the same.


Salts are for hashing, there is no hashing happening here. You'd just use different addresses (and therefore different keys for each user if you wanted).
I'm in agreement that they fucked up. My day job is working with cryptography and security. But their fuckup wasn't having a private key in "plaintext", that's a requirement unless you want a person there typing in a password every time it's needed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:23:59
I agree, but I wasn't talking about that. I'm just saying that "encrypting the encryption key" doesn't work, it just pushes the problem one level deeper.

Also, Segwit is still only "half implemented" in my eyes.
I want to use it, but there's no easy way for me to do so. I *could* start now, but then i'm using some kind of "middle" address format that will go away soon with a new format coming, and spending all the time to secure and setup my tools and ecosystem around a transient format seems pointless when I can just wait another month or 2 and get the new "final" segwit address format.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:09:35
If transactions are being sent, then the key has to be in plaintext.
If you encrypt the key, then the password for that needs to be in plaintext
Unless you have a person physically typing it on every time they do a transfer... But then you are giving one person a lot of power...
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:45:51
No, when you click on the transaction in your coinbase dashboard, what does it say as the expected date and time it will show up in your coinbase account? It will also say that in the confirmation email they sent you when you started the transfer, as well as in the confirmation dialog you had to approve before they started the transfer. it will give you an exact date and time.
And i'm not sure where you are getting those numbers, but [nowhere on their site does it say anything about a "maximum 2 days"](

I'm suprised they didn't go for a one-time difficulty reduction at the time of the hardfork.
Capitalize on the future that were trading, and start the difficulty off at 5% of BTC making it more profitable out of the gate.
Miners would have flocked to it, and it could have risen more slowly stealing hash power from BTC along the way.

Then he will proclaim that their support is the worst because calling them up and complaining like a child that he wants it to go faster won't actually speed it up.
Then after the 1 week that coinbase said it would take it will come through and he will then continue to post about how awful coinbase is because it was "too expensive!!!1" and "they tried to steal my money!11!!!1!".

Coinbase is a "victim of their own success". They are growing much faster than they can keep up with, so don't expect them to be first at just about anything.
But they are in my opinion the most secure and easiest to use bitcoin "system" out there. For most people, Coinbase with 2FA enabled will be more secure than them trying to hold their own private keys, and Coinbase is fully FDIC insured so as long as you don't think the US government is going down any time soon, your money is yours regardless. (and if Coinbase ever goes under, i'd wager that Bitcoin as we know it is done for)
That being said, for more advanced usage, or those who truly want to keep their own bitcoin, they aren't ideal, but i still use them (more accurately GDAX) for trading.
But back on topic, the reason they aren't doing segwit yet is because it's so new. A company like Coinbase can't make any missteps here. They don't have the employee numbers right now to be screwing around implementing things that might not be needed, or might not make the company money. I'm sure they are working on it, but it's not a "needs to be done right now" since it won't make them any real money, it won't make anything more secure, and it won't help them with their customer support issues, so it's a lower priority. Not to mention that a bug or security issue in the code could cost them their entire company, so changes to the core code of their system are not something that should be rushed.
I do have a feeling they are working pretty heavily on it as the second they enable a LN on their "system" they will almost certainly be one of the most used ones, and they are the processing backend for a LOT of companies, so being able to sell their product as having the lowest fees because they have the most popular LN out there is going to be a huge selling point. But they have bigger fish to fry in the immediate future.

I hate when people lump coinbase in with the rest of them.
Blockchain.info, xapo, and bitpay said they would be following the S2X chain. They called it an upgrade and said that all users would be on that chain.
Coinbase said they would allow trading on both chains, would wait a week at minimum to decided which chain should be called bitcoin, but were defaulting to calling s2x "segwit 2x" and bitcoin "bitcoin" for the first week.
How those 2 things are equal i'll never understand.

I'm honestly not sure how it works for those not in the US. FDIC insurance is a US-Government thing, and I'm not sure if it applies to the company, or to the user (do they pay up to $250,000 to the company to reimburse you, or do they pay you directly, I don't know...)
That being said, I do know that it only covers "Coinbase's losses", so if you got 5BTC stolen from your coinbase account, FDIC wouldn't cover that. But if Coinbase goes out of business, gets closed down for fraud, gets hacked directly and has their money stolen, or something else, that's when FDIC insurance kicks in.
You should take a look at [this article from coinbase]( that describes their insurance. It's pretty bare but it does tell you what they cover and what they don't. It looks like for your purchases in the UK your cryptocurrency wallets are covered by private insurance they have.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:46:41
And I see it as the exact opposite.
90% of the complaints I see about coinbase are:
* The fees are too high
* they want too much of my information
* they closed my account for violating their terms about what I spent my money on
* Their support is awful.
The first one is making them stable, the second means they are complying with US regulations which makes them very unlikely to be shut down, the 3rd is due to rules that their USD payment processors force onto them (You can't do business with many credit card processors or banks without agreeing not to allow your money to be used for illegal things). The 4th is getting improved on, but there's no way you can just take on a few million accounts over a month and be able to train customer support reps to keep up with it...
To me, those first 3 complaints put me at ease that they aren't going to be shut down, or go out of business any time soon, and the last one is getting improved on by better funding.
They are the one company in this space that I actually trust, and it's a big reason why I won't touch anything except BTC, ETH, and LTC.
If their goal really was to just get users, then get VC funding, and repeat. They'd lower their fees, they'd be more lax with following regulations, all to get more users to get more VC funding. When the reality is the opposite. They are taking their time with validations to slow down the amount of people, they aren't supporting other altcoins in an effort to reduce the amount of work/liability they are open to.
You want to see a shady company, look at bittrex. No support, they don't follow any patriot act laws, they stay away from fiat to ensure they don't need to follow regulations, etc... Those kinds of companies are the ones you need to lookout for.
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:14:29
So here's the thing.
People here will tell you to never keep your money on coinbase, people here will tell you to buy a trezor or print a paper wallet or store it yourself somehow.
But that assumes you know what you are doing. All it takes is one fuckup, one mistake, one lost hard drive and you could lose it all with no recourse. You could have it stolen because you accidentally connected to the internet while making your address and some malware took it, or lose everything in a fire or flood and not be able to get to your bitcoin, or print it out on a piece of paper and store it somewhere only to have it get stolen.
When you hold your own bitcoin, you are your own bank. And that means you have nobody to go to when things go wrong, you are just out that money.
With coinbase, you are FDIC insured, they handle the security and storage of it, and you can get to it from anywhere that you can login. Coinbase is (in my opinion) the only exchange that is following all the laws, and doing everything right. I STRONGLY recommend you secure the crap out of your coinbase account (setup 2 factor authentication, a strong password, don't share your account info, etc...), but keeping upwards of a few thousand on Coinbase is no big deal, and personally I'd even be willing to keep much larger sums on there if I didn't need my own wallet for other reasons.
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:27:28
Just make sure you use any wallet where you control your own keys, and make your first transaction or 2 after the split to yourself to ensure that even in the event you mess up and your transactions get replayed it will be to a wallet you control.

KYC laws are one of those "company ending" things. You don't do that right, not only will your company cease to exist, but you could face jail time.
I would NEVER trust something that important to my company to a 3rd party. I would keep 100% of that information in my own systems as well backed up as possible.
Unless you have some kind of agreement that at any time I wish I can mirror all the info from your system into mine I can't see many places trusting you, the risk is just too high. If you go out of business, or get sold, or fuck up and lose data, I would be completely fucked.

So that means that 80% of the users will together make up less than 20% of the bitcoin owned there. So while most may be a drop in the bucket, it's still interest in bitcoin.

And I can speak to hundreds of men, it doesn't mean the entire planet is 100% men.
Happy customers who just wanted to get on, buy $100 of crypto with a credit card, then spend/hold it aren't going to go on reddit and talk to people who are saying hyperbolic bullshit that doesn't match their experience at all.
Coinbase is a company, they need to make money. Believe it or not, they can't just shut your account down and steal whatever you have in there, they have laws to follow about that. And denying users the ability to buy using their platform is another dumb decision business wise, so I highly doubt that the "majority" of their possible users are having trouble like that.
More likely is that you are talking to people who are clearly trying to scam/steal repeatedly and are trying to stir the pot to make it easier for them in the future.

Sorry it's been a few days since I was on reddit.
What is the exact error it's giving you?
If you are getting tons of errors and it's not letting you continue, you can try salvaging the wallet.
You can salvage the wallet by opening a command prompt on your computer (in the start menu, go to run, then type `cmd.exe`).
From there type `"C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" --salvagewallet` including the quotes (type the command our yourself, don't ever copy and paste text into command prompts when it comes to bitcoin, there can be invisible characters that can sneak in there and break stuff).
That should start the process of recovering the wallet. It will try to grab just the private keys from your wallet and post them to a file called `debug.log` (for you this will most likely be located at `%APPDATA%\Bitcoin\debug.log`). That will contain your private keys near the bottom of the file if the salvage was successful.

You can't argue for replacement of a system if you don't have a replacement.
You can handwave away the problems as "someone else will solve them" but the reality is they won't. There have been tens of thousands of years across 10 billion people to attempt this, and nobody has done it. 
Until you have a solution to the "problem" of government and taxation, you can fuck right off. Holy shit I can't believe I started to be interested in what you were saying... You literally have no idea about how to do things, you are just repeating things like "market" and "TAXATION IS THEFT" and other bullshit. you are a fucking parrot!

Okay for starters, don't reply to any private messages you may get. If the discussion isn't happening in the open on this subreddit, don't trust it at all. People WILL message you trying to  get you to send them files, or run commands yourself and send them the text, DONT DO ANY OF THAT. All it takes is a string of characters to steal your bitcoin, and there are ways of making it look like nothing important to get you to send it to them.
That being said, First go to here on your old windows XP machine:
C:\Documents and Settings\YourUserName\Application data\Bitcoin
In that folder there should be a file named `wallet.dat`. That is your bitcoin wallet file, don't send that to anyone, keep that VERY safe.
Copy that file on to a USB drive or something local, don't email it to yourself, don't try to upload it to anything, keep it local. If you don't have a USB drive to transfer it with, go buy one. If there is even a slightly significant amount of bitcoin here, it will be worth it.
Next install "Bitcoin Core" from bitcoin.org (again, don't follow any links from PMs make sure you actually have the real Bitcoin Core from bitcoin.org) on your new PC.
Assuming your new PC is Windows 7, type `%APPDATA%\Bitcoin` in the address bar of your file explorer, that should bring you to a folder that has a wallet.dat already in there. RENAME THAT FILE to `wallet.dat.old`. DO NOT DELETE IT. It's almost always safer to just rename it, you can always rename it back if you find out you need it.
Copy your old `wallet.dat` to that folder, and start Bitcoin-QT back up. It should take quite a while to sync and work it out, but you should see your balance show up after a while.
If at any point this is too technical for you, or you get stuck, don't trust anyone online to help you, especially not in private. Go to  They are the only service in this area that I would trust. They charge a fee for their work, but you can be almost positive that they will help you out and won't steal any of your money.

@_date: 2017-10-31 14:13:31


how would this market work? Get into details. How would you go about getting a road repaved near your house?


Again, be specific. You get cancer, how do you pay for treatment? How do you get to the hospital? How does the hospital pay for it's equipment? How do the manufacturers of the equipment get paid for making it? How do the designers of that equipment get paid for their time? You get hit by a tree in a storm and are paralyzed. How do you pay for treatment? How do you pay for alterations to your home? Especially when you have no job any more because you can't work.
Keep in mind the tens of thousands of "gofundme's" or "kickstarters" that have 0/1000 backers in our current world WITH taxes and charities and social nets in some ways.


Because things that the government provide through tax money are naturally uneven. It can cost $1 per person to get an apartment building in NYC to run power lines to their block, but it can (and does) cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per person to run electrical lines out to someone on a farm. Because of that, nobody wants to be a farmer, because it's so prohibitively expensive to even get power to the location that it's basically impossible to make a profit.
The idea being that if everyone pays $10 per person, we can get everyone covered by electrical power. Nobody is bankrupt from it, and everyone benefits.
And saying it's a better option than "choice" is disingenuous. Taxes are still a choice, but they are a collective choice, not and individual one. We as a society have learned that pooling our money together for *some* things makes us all better off. Where that line between what should and shouldn't be paid for by the government is an argument that goes back to the beginning of time, but the vast extreme majority agree that it's the right way to work.
And this is all completely ignoring the idea of laws. Laws take time and knowledge and money to create and enforce. You want laws, without them my strawman above of your neighbor just killing you and taking your house won't be a strawman, it will be reality. But how will you pay for enforcement of those laws? How do you propose drafting them?
Just look at history at what happens without many good regulations. Going all the way back to some of the first recorded history, people will naturally amass power and influence and use it for personal gain. Someone gets a leg up in the world, and they use their power/money/influence to gain more power/money/influence at the expense of others. "Law" is basically the only way we have found that can stop this process on some level for any significant amount of time.
And law de facto needs enforcers, and it can't be optional. And therefore you need to pay those enforcers. And like it or not, every time they are involved in one way or another, there is going to be a happy person, and a sad person. They live between conflict, that's an enforcer's job. Their funding MUST be neutral, or they will be swayed into favoring one side or another (generally whichever side can keep them from being homeless or dead). And the ONLY way to have neutral income, is to take some from everyone.
Now, don't get me wrong, our modern tax system is a mess, and there are a TON of things I don't agree with about it, but the fact is it's the best way that we as humans have found to create a "society" of any kind.

Because I've read the rest of this thread, every time you get asked about what your idea is to replace the whole structure of government you reply with "tell me why we NEED taxes".
The truth is that you don't NEED taxes, just like you don't NEED someone to stop your neighbor from buying every piece of land around you letting you die, or just straight up coming into your house and killing you.
But the whole idea of a government which can create and enforce laws that elected officials can craft and debate on is the best way we have of managing "society". And despite your instance that it's "sickening" that you or anyone else should pay for someone else's problems, you have and will continue to take those benefits throughout your life while attempting to not pay for them yourself.
But i'll indulge you, explain to me how you expect to pay for a functioning society without taxes? Things like roads, hospitals, police, disability care, utilities like electricity and water, etc... (i'm making the assumption that you want those things, if you don't think they are necessary for life, a solution for you is to just find an island in the pacific ocean somewhere and setup shop. No taxes! And nowhere to shit that isn't a hole in the ground!)
Don't just reply back with "there are ways" or "how are taxes NEEDED for that", actually explain it.

Yeah sure.
So when you are managing your own wallet for long-term storage (often called "cold storage") you need to be very careful.
Generally the best way to do it is either work with a hardware wallet (like a trezor) or print a "paper wallet". With bitcoin you can generate addresses entirely offline, without any contact with the outside world, and you should. That way if there were malware on your PC, or the program you were using to generate it was backdoored it could send your private key across the internet.
The reason this is more of a threat than say just worrying about malware stealing your coinbase password is that you can change your coinbase password. Coinbase can and will monitor for logins from strange areas and can reset your password for you. And the "bad-guys" can't see how much you have in your account. Not to mention that Coinbase has a feature called their "Vault" which locks your coins away and makes them impossible to withdraw without 48 hours notice. So even if someone stole all your account details and tried to withdraw it, you would get multiple emails, text messages, and alerts telling you it was happening with an option to stop the transfer at any time in that 48 hours. With a "raw" bitcoin address this is all the opposite.
The bad guys can just sit and watch that address on the blockchain, and the second it gets more than $5000 on it, steal the money then. There's no way for you to change the "private key" for that address, or setup a 2-factor authentication for it, or anything else.
If your private key is stolen, you won't know until it's too late. So it's extremely important that you take as many precautions as you can when generating it, as both you and the bad-guys can sit on that information for years before acting on it. And while technically the same thing can happen to coinbase, it's literally their fulltime job to protect those. Not to mention that they have insurance, so even in the worst case scenario of coinbase getting massively hacked, you are guaranteed to get up to $250,000 of your money from the US-Government no matter what.
I still recommend learning about all of this yourself and experimenting with it (at least if it really interests you). It can definitely be a "hobby" of sorts, but do your experimenting with like $50-100 of coins until you are certain you are capable of handling the responsibility and the risk associated with being your own bank. Because everyone makes mistakes (I sure as hell made my fair share while learning about this, I actually lost 10 BTC back in 2010), so make yours with $50 instead of with $5000, and leave the "pros" to do the heavy lifting until you are ready to take over.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:37:53
If you really believe that, then start trading on margin.
I'll give you 1 BTC, and you can give me 1.5BTC back in 1 month. According to your graph, you should make an assload of money on that deal! Parabolic increases are nuts! The 1 BTC I loan you could be worth 100X in a month! You'd be dumb not to take that deal!

There is also no reason that a Satoshi has to be the smallest amount.
The protocol can be changed in the future to further divide a Satoshi into as many more as is needed.
So in 100 years when a Satoshi is $1 USD, we could have sat-cents worth 1/100th of a satoshi, or kinsmores worth 1/10000th of a Satoshi (and I'm going to be pushing for that name!).

And just to clarify, a "safe hard fork" should be very far in the future.
Like put the code in today, but have it activate in 1 year. That way everyone can take their time safely upgrading and by the time the fork block comes around, everyone is running the same code and you have pretty much 100% consensus.
Many of the core developers believe we should have a 2x blocksize increase at some point, but they wanted to do it like this. Safe, slow, steady, controlled. The 2x group has decided that it's okay to do this much more quickly, which is leading to this split.

That's the saying! Lol write that on your IRS forms!
I only hope that one day your house is on fire and you call 911 they just fucking laugh in your face. Or maybe the firefighters will come by but when they see your trezor burnt up already they will just leave as you can't pay them. Hopefully you paid for your own firefighter course which was nearby as the cost of traveling far on your private roads is super expensive! And the risk of leaving your secure compound is pretty great as you can't afford your own personal body guards for another year or so. Maybe the firefighters will teach you how to not die if you call them up right now. Oh but wait you don't have a phone line capable of calling the firehouse because you didn't spring for the "lifesaver package"! Aw shucks!

Hopefully you were able to buy all the firefighting equipment you need for a fire before you have one! Although without a mail service or public roads it's going to cost quite a lot to get it from the manufacturer!
And that's all assuming you don't get sick and die before then! Which do you prioritise first? Do you buy all the medical equipment you might need first, or all the firefighting equipment you might need first?
You might suggest going to a hospital, but your neighbor just bought all the land around you and now you are landlocked so they can shoot you for trespassing the second you step foot out of your house. Hopefully you bought that helicopter a few years ago!
Oh but wait you can't buy that helicopter because your boss just decided to stop paying you but forced you to continue working! What are you going to do about it? You can't afford any guns or your own personal police force! And his police force says he's allowed to do it! Aw well you should have planned better!
But hey, at least you aren't spending your money on those freeloaders with their roads and hospitals and firehouses and police forces and laws and jails! Fucking hippies! TAXATION IS THEFT! I RENOUNCE MY CITIZENSHIP! I DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR LAWS!

They still haven't said what they are calling each side.
People saying they will or "probably will" call B2x Bitcoin are wrong, they are waiting to see how support looks as we get closer to the fork, which IMO is a completely valid way of doing it.
Right now S2X has pretty low support in the futures markets, and if we keep putting our money where our mouth is (by supporting the original chain and working on the futures markets to show support) then Coinbase will call Bitcoin Bitcoin and everyone will be happy with their free coins come november.
