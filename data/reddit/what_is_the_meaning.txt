Bitcoiners should hire thousands of bitcoin mimes all across the country to perform in front of reserve banks and investment bank offices. Lmfao
I’d even pitch in some paper money on that endeavor.

They seem to be from a very conservative place because they “beat” around the bush when it comes to mentioning the sexual acts.  That’s about all I took from it.  (Pun intended)
Some broken English too.

This just happened to me over a less than one year old state income tax bill.  It happened to my wife over an old hospital debt from a shithole that almost killed her.  It’s fucked up that they apparently have this ability.

Dudes been doing a show daily for years.  Started on YouTube.  All of a sudden he’s supposed to be a Russian agent?  These people have lost their damn minds.  Get the fuck outta here with that garbage.

The ip address from the source server in mine says Austria.  But that could simply be a vpn.

That's funny.  My wife said she heard them talking about this same thing on a morning talk radio show in the last day or two.
I couldn't care less if some idiot actually had video of me jacking it.  Let them send it around!  It'd make a good story!  lmfao
But I could imagine other people might not think like me and would panic and do it.

Lol  I couldn't give less of a shit if they did.  Everyone beats the dragon, so who cares.  I always wink at the NSA as I'm finishing.  They also have thousands of hours of me picking my nose.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Pokemon Go was designed by the NSA to easily get video data from locations without the expense of going there themselves.  Instead of placing cameras everywhere, they just convince people to play this game and go around being their own army of mobile camera units.  Congratulations players, you are now the governments robotic camera drones.  lol
