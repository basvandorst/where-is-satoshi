not until they short the hell out of it first to bring the price down to more manageable levels, they're not gonna buy one bitcoin for $14-19K thats for sure, they've been in the business for decades they arent gonna FOMO like your average joe.

the Whales knew all the newbies would FOMO and buy in at an all time high, i mean what are these poor people thinking buying in at $14-19K for a single bitcoin?!!! now they are going to get eaten alive by the whales, i really feel for the new people who have no idea what they're getting into and just bought into the hype and mania without a good understanding of the market mechanics, the players who are manipulating the game and cryptocurrencies in general.

not tryin to scare ya but you bought in when the price was at an all time high(this is never a good idea) during a crazy pump orchestrated by whales.  Now the whales are dumping for profits and in anticipation of CME and CBOE futures and it could get ugly. the saying goes dont invest more than you can afford to lose.

back then the market cap was small so a whale could sneeze and the price would move wildly, but now there are so many more users and $150Bln cap and many are hodlers so there will be dips but nothing plummeting

this is because bitcoin core threatens their centralization so of course they have to do everything to keep their power they have invested billions in their mining equipment so they gotta make most money out of it
