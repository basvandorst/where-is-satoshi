Should have made my original post more clear. it's upvotes and downvotes on [tinytipbot.com]( not reddit

I appreciate your input Phaxda. Alot of what you just said is exactly what I'm going for. The site is supposed to be informal, silly, rude, and at  times nonsense. It's called "tinytipbot" for goodness sake. Too many bitcoin projects are too serious. I wanted to do something that wasn't just geared towards Bitcoin heads.
If anyone has any problem with the content, by all means post something you deem interesting and I'll definitely tip you. My intention with the site is to make it an online forum where people actually get paid for the content they post. I definitely don't want to be carrying the site by myself. I'll have the code up in a day or so to automatically upvote posts as soon as you post so it goes on the front page. Right now you have to upvote your own post manually.
I responded to your "hot chick". dope pick, and you are definitely in for a surprise with that girl! I Looove House Of Cards.
Even though it may not be your cup of tea, thanks for the kind words, and by all means withdraw your 39 cents before you leave for good! you literally have the highest amount in your account right now.

I was referring more to the technical aspects of reddit grabbing the image from my web.... oh, never mind. love your name by the way.
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:04:58
categories are now bigger for you my friend.
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:41:40
You're right here bub,  [tinytipbot.com/listing/view/136]( and [tinytipbot.com/listing/view/137](  the posts are listed in order of hotness like hacker news or this site we are currently on. I just upvoted you so your posts are now on the front of the website, and just tipped you 75 grand. literally lol'd on the first post. I should probably do a minor rewrite so that your post is automatically upvoted by 1. hmmm
@_date: 2014-11-21 16:47:58
yeah, it's still in beta. It's definitely not trying to compete with Reddit. Your suggestion is definitely noted though in that I should probably make the categories more noticeable. I would totally tip you for your helpful observations if you were on my site.

lol, I only meet friends, friend. and i post silly content because I'm naturally a goofball, but there's no reason serious discussions can be had, and with proper punctuation! I just type naturally as things flow from my brain to my fingers. If people start using the site, it will get better, I promise. I do realize not everyone is a fan of my humor. 
If you like House Of Cards, you might want to give Scandal a try. It's first season starts out slow, but it really gets good going  into the third.

that's what's up. you can email me at tinytipbot[at]gmail.com, although I've got alot on my plate right now. This took me months by the way and many different prototypes. It has the same voting algorithm as reddit on both the posts and comments (if anybody ever posts any). I think going the color coin route would add too much complexity to something that doesn't really need to be. right now, the satoshi are just values in a database, not tied to the blockchain at all. I could have easily called them Nakamoto's.

And a Fedora Tip to you to sir. Thank you kindly!
@_date: 2014-11-22 23:06:15
you sir are a gentleman and a scholar! [slap ass](
to Chakra_Scientist, I'm not exactly sure how reddit does what it ddoes, but it pulls the last image that was submitted to the website. Reddit pulled that from [this]( listing on tinytipbot.
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:48:59
amazing! I love it.Try to post some content on the site about anything you want, it doesn't have to be about bitcoin at all. If it sucks, it'll get downvoted, if good, free tips for you buddy!

upvote promo went fast so I put up a new promo. your first five upvotes or downvotes now get 500 Satoshi. on [tinytipbot]( not reddit!
@_date: 2014-11-22 03:20:41
it's confusing, I'm sorry. If more people continue to be confused I might have to rename some pages or what not. But what you submit to the front page is called listings and posts are actually comments to those listings.

I''m not exactly sure how R&amp;B singer Monica got on the thumbnail.
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:49:20
I just added the automatic upvote on submission. I'm coding as fast as you guys can give suggestions!
