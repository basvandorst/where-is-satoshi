@_date: 2018-09-08 12:03:52
Just stop with your hard to remember due to service related injuries. The problem is you friend not anyone else. You have a problem remember the previous lie overlapping the new lie and now it's hard for you to keep your stories straight. I scanned your post history and literally 10 months ago you're talking about what to do with your btc you currently own. If I was in your lying position and had 2000 btc the second btc was at 1000$ a coin I'd go wait a second I'm a fucking millionaire. Not lonnnnnnng after the fact of up to 20k down to 6k over 10 months and go wait a second I'm a multi millionaire. The problem with your story is within your own post history you talk about having 1 or 3 btc.  Now its 2000s and you cant remember because of service kk cool story bro.
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:18:50
Also pretty sure people in high asset classes don't care about reddit or random posts lol

Please stop spitting out random trash before you Google simple facts.
To have Tether properly audited is slow because it's a unique process with crypto. So instead of have people wait and speculate like you they hired others in the mid term...
Second off.....
FSS, the Washington, D.C., law firm that Tether hired to assess its reserves and write the report, has no shortage of gravitas. It was founded by three former federal judges, one of them a former director of the FBI, Louis Freeh.
Another of the firm's partners, retired Judge Eugene R. Sullivan, is on the advisory board of one of Tether's banks, and was introduced to the company through that connection, according to the report. His ties to the bank also helped FSS do the review "in a timely and comprehensive manner, ensuring that no pertinent information was overlooked," the report says.

@_date: 2018-08-11 12:54:53
Yeah and ? He never said 90 on btc you implied he meant btc. He just said hes down 90%.... I would make an educated guess he meant his portfolio as a whole.

It was people are just stupid...... USDT company Tether has the assets to back the 3 billion in coins they transfer..... so it's not thin air its being backed by their money. The problem with crypto is every fucking moron who invests 10 bucks decides he knows everything about these mega billion $ companies and just spews random dogshit facts he reads. This is like all the personal trainers who watch YouTube and all of a sudden can teach others how to stay healthy..... smh
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:14:38

@_date: 2018-10-11 01:16:02
It's still up from .01 cent so just buy at appropriate levels or DCA and relax. Dont use credit or debt and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:17:45

@_date: 2018-10-05 23:50:28
Please stop lol. We can buy many btc for 6k your argument is terrible. People dont buy alts because they're cheap. They buy them because they feel they're good projects. That's like telling everyone to buy Berkshire Hathaway and not bother with Amazons and microsofts back in the day because they're cheap. Eventually good projects pay the fruits of their labor.

Sound money ?. Money fluctuates constantly you'll never have sound money not with anything it constantly changes. Btc. Cash. Visa. Etc. So not too sure why you're concerned. Get with the times or be left behind imo

Volatility is bogus first off. Second off transaction fees and interest from banks are absurdly high. Exchange hacks?? Ohhhh you mean internet bank robbery. Yeah that shit happens to banks too brotha thing is they dont publicize it. Pretty sure more fiat money has been robbed at gun point than any other thing but sure let's run with it. Pumps and dumps ? Ok so basically the only real thing is to be able to control the ico and random shitty projects that are allowed. Yet no legit exchange hosts corrupt coins ornpump and dump coins. It's up to the user to buy so its nobodies fault but the user. Just like a bank I can go get 100k loan and if I fail to pay it the bank doesnt go ok you didnt know here is your money back. The difference between the 2 is you cant buy crypto if you dont have money. But banks love it when you use credit and loans because they get their initial back plus interest and you cant just not pay them so yeah they always win because most humans are in desperate situations.

Um I wouldnt say they dont know what they're doing. I would probably say that they cant afford to lose it in the first place. And theres a fuck load of coins that were promising and are now worthless and anyone holding them is a moron but the panic sellers are looked at as having godlike foresight. Investing in general is just risky. Dont do it if you cant enjoy it......
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:11:26
Quebec is a  horribly run province imo. None of his surprises me. I dont hate French Canadians, I just think the province hates Canada as a whole and the majority of the population in Quebec thinks they're better than anyone else in Canada yet when they need help they cry for federal help.
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:07:53
If it's not bitcoin itself another crypto will eventually take place of fiat. The first one through the door always gets shot but opens and paves the way for others.

Pretty much..... Bank logic = Give us all your money and when you get paid have it direct sent to us don't worry though we will tell you when you can and can't take it out but you also have to pay us monthly for this. And if you have too many transfers a month that's extra. Also every single time you call in we will make you wait hours to talk to us. All those representatives yup we pay them with your interest fees. Basically trust us though we know how to make ourselves rich off you working.  Intelligent customer response = um can't I just hold my own money and buy things when I want and not pay you for doing nothing?

You give money to bank (deposit it in your savings or cheq) they say ok we will hold it for you. They put it to work immediately and just simply cover the funds if they fuck up. You invest with them same process. They give you the dog shit return of 1% or let's even say something obsurd like 10% yearly. Tbey earn way more by actually investing your money they dknt just give you 10% just because. They profit like 30%+ and if they fuck up they can simply print more money on a federal level. You cannot do this if you fuck up an investment you claim it on taxes and barely scrap by. They just go uh oh we need more. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:34:33

1 Tron = 547 sats (at time of replying to this), those 547 sats in BTC value when BTC rises the 547 sats are worth more. So the price of TRX goes up even if nobody is buying TRX just because BTC rose and all Altcoins trade pair with BTC/ ETH etc...

That's because Binance is actually the smoothest exchange with the best support and they need to keep evolving. Honestly I've never had an issue with Binance from day 1. Verfying with them took like 2 hours and everything's been smooth sailing for me. Keep it up binance!

They earn THEM it. They pay you .5% for lending them your money basically.  And if they lose the money on the investment they only owe you .5% and they're allowed to print money you're not. Oh also if you lose money good luck. If you gain money you pay taxes do you think they do ?
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:23:26
