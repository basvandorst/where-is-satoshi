One of the biggest names in Silicon Valley is placing a moonshot bet on bitcoin.
Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm’s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.
Founders and Mr. Thiel are well-known for early investments in companies like Facebook Inc. that sometimes take years to come to fruition. The bitcoin bet is quickly showing promise. Founders bought around $15 million to $20 million in bitcoin, and it has told investors the firm’s haul is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the digital currency’s ripping rise in the past year.
It isn’t clear if Founders has sold any of its holdings yet. The bet hasn’t been previously reported.
Bitcoin vaulted last year from a fringe area of Wall Street interest to the most talked-about asset in the financial world. The digital currency started 2017 trading around $1,000, then shot to near $20,000 as individual and institutional investors alike ramped up speculating on its rise. From its all-time high reached in November, the price chopped almost in half over the next month. The cryptocurrency traded at $14,292 on Friday, according to CoinDesk, up 1,375% on the year.
Relatively few mainstream investors have bought large sums of bitcoin, scared off by concerns about cybersecurity and liquidity, as well as more mundane fears of investment losses. Even some of those who do own it are cautious about speaking too publicly, lest they draw the attention of hackers.
The recent price plunge has also spooked some. On Dec. 22, the prominent investor Michael Novogratz said he was delaying launching a crypto-focused hedge fund for outside investors, stating “we didn’t like market conditions for new investors.” South Korea announced last week it would crack down on cryptocurrency trading, an ominous sign given that the country at one point accounted for as much as one-fourth of global bitcoin trading activity.
Founders began buying in for its investors before the recent volatility, the people familiar with the matter said.
The billionaire Mr. Thiel is an outspoken libertarian who co-founded digital payments service PayPal Holdings Inc. and made headlines as a prominent booster of President Donald Trump. He previously ran a multibillion-dollar hedge fund focused on global macroeconomic trends, and had some success navigating the financial crisis before racking up investment losses by investing in safe havens and missing out on the subsequent rebound.
As a venture capitalist, Mr. Thiel and Founders fund are among the most successful in Silicon Valley. Founders has more than $3 billion under management and has taken stakes in more-than 100 companies, including Facebook, Airbnb Inc., SpaceX and Lyft. More recent investments include the crypto-focused hedge funds Metastable Capital and Polychain Capital, which puts money into blockchain companies.
Mr. Thiel made the decision to buy up bitcoin together with Founders’ other investment partners, a person familiar with the matter said.
By buying bitcoin outright, as opposed to backing other companies doing business in the space, Founders would seem to be breaking with its investing tradition, an investor said. But in communications with investors, Founders representatives have sought to cast the investment as a high-risk, high-reward wager similar to its other venture bets, the people familiar with the matter said.
The representatives have told firm backers that a cascade of cash into technology companies has stretched their valuations to historic highs, making stakes in startups as dangerous a risk as ever. Bitcoin, on the other hand, could multiply several times over in the coming years.
Thanks to its rise, the bitcoin investment is already estimated as the most valuable in the Founders’ most recent, $1.3 billion venture fund. People close to the firm said that the fund hasn’t made many investments yet.
Founders has also warned investors that bitcoin does share one potentially perilous similarity with more traditional venture capital investments: The digital currency could be worth nothing, or close to it, in the end.

Mirrors Edge went on sale for [5 bucks this July]( 1 week ago. In Europe it sold for [2.49 euros]( which is 3.05 USD.
Today, not even a week since the steam sales ended, you are selling this for 1.6854 BTC which is currently about 15 USD.
Using this website, others can confirm this pattern for the other games you are selling.
For mirrors edge, you are indeed profiting from these transactions with a maximum of 400% markup if you come from europe, less if you come from the US.
This is unethical.

I think politics discussion on reddit is fundamentally flawed because of how reddit is made. The upvote system enforces groupthink and homogeneity; the fact that you need to find and subscribe to nondefaults will only skew this sameness further.

Thanks for all of your guys' replies. I've read through all of them and I see that just because consumers might benefit from postponing their purchases (due to deflation or moore's law) does not necessarily mean they will keep postponing. I guess I was skeptical, and maybe still am a little skeptical of a real currency that in theory should keep increasing in value.
One more question: what caused the price collapse of last year? I'm under the impression that the media picked up a story where some guy lost hundreds of thousands of USD due to a virus, which caused a panic and mass sell off. Is this the whole story?

Exactly! When it comes to the problem of deflation on this forum, people just say the common 'well, people have to eat eventually so they'll spend'. Problem is, that is assuming there exists only one deflationary currency. In real life we have both inflationary fiat and deflationary bitcoin. What currency would any rational person use to buy products? The inflationary one of course!
That's why we have so many posts on this subreddit saying aww man I wish I hadn't spent X amount of bitcoins back Y years, it could've been worth X*(deflation rate) now. And of course they use USD to compare gains... Like the 1 million dollar pizza when bitcoin was in its infancy.
There really is no incentive to actually spend bitcoin like a real currency if all it does is keep deflating.
I know this isn't a popular opinion on this forum but I'm all ears for arguments against my position. I really want to believe in bitcoin's success but right now it just seems like a lot of speculators jacking up the price. 
Perhaps the best time to cash out is right before the mtgox queue clears. But whatever, I don't own a crystal ball.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but 1/100 shares don't collect dividends. Only full shares or 100 1/100 shares collect dividends. Come to think of it, that's probably the reason why burnside decided to sell partial shares, so that he can collect the dividends for those shares without needing to disburse his partial PT shares.

Facebook is by no means an indicator of bitcoin's future. Any idiot can set up a Facebook account easy as pie. And each idiot has social pressure bringing pushing him to use Facebook. All in all it's a cumulative feedback effect that drives Facebook to be a near monopoly for social networking.
Bitcoin won't have this benefit because it's hard to get into and not intuitive in use. What exactly is the average person going to spend using bitcoin? Drugs? That's all?
@_date: 2013-07-21 19:35:09

You haven't made money unless you've sold it. But this is from a speculator's perspective. If you really believe in bitcoin and use it often then indeed you have 'made money'.

Hm. Something like an online banking interface would be really neat. Instead of users having to deal with wallet.dat's or electrum.dat's, alphanumeric addresses or sluggish qt clients, they could having bitcoin amounts attached to their online banking.
Exchanging directly from fiat&lt;-&gt;BTC on an online bank account would be lovely. 
2 factor authentication might be necessary as the average user probably doesn't have great computer security and is running Windows.
Some folks on this subreddit may not like banks, but for bitcoin to become mainstream, the interface has to be more user friendly. This could be a big draw for bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not a feasible currency until it finds some equilibrium price. Until then we will have to deal with deflation (and more pertinently, speculators). Like you said in OP, deflation is to the detriment of bitcoin as a currency.
I don't think we will find this equilibrium price just from the thought experiment of 21 million BTC being applied to an ever increasing economy. It will continuously deflate. 
Again ITT people are applying the fallacy that deflation will be counteracted by the fact that people will eventually spend; but this is not necessarily true. In practice we have inflationary fiat and deflationary bitcoin. Any normal, rational actor will anticipate that BTC will be more valuable in the future so they will prefer to spend fiat and hoard bitcoin. Fiat is not disappearing any time soon.
Currency is derived from middle English meaning "in circulation". If bitcoin is continuously being hoarded, it's not a currency. Note how people never address the problem of bitcoin's deflation directly. They only mention how bad the current system is, as if that alone is proof for the future success of bitcoin. But we'll see... Maybe if deflation were a constant 2% a year things would turn out okay. Problem is the speculators.

A little late here, but how exactly did you change your BTC into USD to pay off your debt? Did you trigger any anti money laundering protocols? 
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:49:38
That's 5000%
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:04:19
Exactly. He lied about selling his bitcoin. What's stopping him from lying about who he is? How does OP know those dox are his actual dox?
Not to mention doxxing is against reddit's global rules.

What a bunch of greedy fucks. They know that time is of the essence before the difficulty ramps up high. Might as well make more money right?

How would you need money as an immortal being? You'd be free from hunger and any material demand. Perhaps you would need money to pay for a skill you haven't acquired but as an immortal being, you'd have plenty of spare time to learn.

Wow this guy is a fucking idiot lol. But it makes sense since he writes for BBT.

Agreed. You're getting shat on by downvotes but you are absolutely correct. There is a reality distortion field (AKA circlejerk) in this subreddit. Please don't jerk to death.

I doubt that would be a fluid asset. Better off getting cash or a normal 1oz bar or coin.

Sounds pretty good. It's not obvious what genesis refers to to the non bitcoiner but obvious enough for us. Sounds like a conservative enough bank to store your money with.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:13:22
Damn. I think you just became the victim of an IRL circlejerk complete with downvotes. I'm sorry man. Did you mention anything about the price increase?

Deluge definitely.

That sub is more of an economic outcry. My views are more to do with culture. I mean, we're free to do what we want with our money but I'll look down on you if you do so.

Oh. Any ideas on how to change electrum servers? I don't see any menus that would allow me to. Nothing is coming up on google.
Edit: Nevermind, I just needed to click the green circle in the bottom right to change. 
Doesn't seem to be the issue though even if I change to different servers.

My condolences. USD to BTC is hard.

Yeah because it makes people realize that they aren't invincible and that the price never keeps going up. Cocksuredness leads to circlejerking.

Pretty much what I'm afraid of. I read online that bullion's value decreases if the container is opened or if there are fingerprints and such on the gold. Somewhat of a catch 22.

Yeah but everyone gets paid in fiat. Fiat will exist.

He might want to convert them into fiat. This might cause a problem when the banks report (due to AML) his deposits that came from seemingly nowhere. I've read on that small monthly increments (like 1000 USD) don't trigger any alarms.

Be careful guys. Remember, this guy can always charge back his credit card, keep your bitcoin and also temporarily disable your steam account due to the chargeback in addition to losing your game.
Buyer beware. People do this all the time.

God I am so afraid of buying or selling. What the fuck is going on? Bought some at 10... I should be happy but I'm scared as hell. 
I think ill wait til the mtgox queue clears in a week to see where we're at... That would be most reasonable?

I read through the OP. My question is, why? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:47:13
Oh. How much did you change? Just a ballpark estimate if giving a precise amount is bothersome. I'd like to know how much is a 'safe' withdrawl.
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:48:33
1 oz of gold
Pretty much the only thing I've spent BTC on though.

I'm not sure your average criminal could even figure out how to use the private key, let alone bitcoin.

This cuts into the heart of the issue. Why is the consumer punished by using bitcoin as its intended function? It's supposed to be a medium of transaction, a currency. But there are many people who intend it only to be a commodity, like your coworker.
Had you spent fiat on those purchases and hoarded the bitcoin (like most other people), you wouldn't be in this situation. Which sucks; you are being punished for using it appropriately.
I think deflationary currency has significant problems that haven't been addressed. If you are hoarding bitcoin, you don't believe in bitcoin as a currency; only as a means to get rich. 
But put it this way; you aren't as bad as the guy who spent 20k BTC for a pizza a few years back.
**Edit**: You're doing it right, but doing what's right isn't always what is rational... but thanks. For bitcoin to succeed we need to do right.
Also, your coworker is a douche. There's no way he could have predicted bitcoin exploding these past months. He didn't earn shit and shouldn't have the right to gloat.
