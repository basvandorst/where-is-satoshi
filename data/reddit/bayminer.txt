You know BTC hasn’t arrived yet because even its most ardent supporters use terms like “millionaire.”  You value the bitcoin in relation to the number of dollars it will get you.  When you value your dollars in terms of how many Bitcoin they will get you, then it’s time to put 60 percent of everything you have ever made on this earth in the asset.  :-)
But seriously congrats on a job well done in your investment and your perseverance and belief.

“If you need a bigger block size right now, there’s nothing stopping you from using BCH”
This is superhuman thinking in a nutshell.  Take a guy who wants to use BTC and tell him to use BCH.  I don’t need a bigger block size.  I need a useable blockchain.  In a year it will be too late.  
You seem to be assuming I want BCH to take over BTC.  I want the opposite.  That could change.  I’m not into the religion thing.  And neither are the millions of other people you need to maintain the value of your coin, because without them what you hold is a bunch of zeros and ones on a hard drive.

Yes.  The market price today is the value (in fiat) of your bitcoin.  That is what you can trade it for.  
The value of all bitcoin is not the market cap.  
It’s really not a very controversial statement.  You can sell all the stock of a company for at or more than its market cap.  You can’t sell all bitcoin for that.  Nobody would buy it and if they did it would be worthless.  But that doesn’t mean bitcoin has no value.  Its value is immense.  Why?  Because people use it to store and transfer value.  
Its value just isn’t measurable (or even estimable) by market cap.  It’s just not a worthwhile metric.  
But I don’t feel all that strongly about it.  People can say what they want, even if it is totally asenine.

You are marooned on a deserted island with 9 thirsty, shipwrecked pirates and a single 1 gallon jug of fresh water. 
You start out as friends and ration it in 10 parts.  The other 9 drink their share and you keep your 1/10.  
Then they kill you and drink your water.

Now you are being silly.  If you really are an engineer you know perfectly well that the reason 2x failed was because it was buggy, had no support and forked one block too early, not because of the block size code change itself.  It was a failure in execution from a hasty and patchwork effort, not a failure of the concept. 
If there is any one thing I have learned over the years it is that whenever a person refuses to address an issue substantively, but rather falls back on their credentials to support a non-answer with the back of their hand, it usually means they don’t know what the fuck they are talking about.  I don’t know if that is true or not in your case but you don’t really seem to have any substance to back your strident assertions.

Sorry but this is nonsense.  The “decentralization” argument is based on the notion that storage cost to run a full node will some day get very expensive.
Right now you can store the blockchain on a full node for the cost of a single transaction.  
You can buy a 10tb Drive for 300 bucks.  One seventh the cost of a single modern ASIC.  
The argument rings hollow.  The network will remain decentralized with bigger blocks.  Fees and congestion will go down, but it will remain decentralized.
Is this not something that is acknowledged by all?  I thought the whole argument in favor of small block sizes is to keep fees high to force people to make fewer and more efficient transactions.  
Personally I think that is idiotic because they won’t.  They will make the transactions they want to make on a network that provides them with the ability to do so.  
This is like coke deciding to put sour apple flavor in their beverage so that consumers don’t drink as much of it, then responding to complaints by telling people to drink Pepsi.  In other words - it is fucking dumb.  
In any event - it strikes me that the whole “increased blocks will ensure the network goes haywire or goes into the hands of the few lucky enough to have a buffalo drive” just doesn’t make sense.  If it did, then why does the damned road map contemplate increased block sizes “some day.”

The title of Satoshi’s white paper is “Bitcoin: a peer to peer electronic cash system”
The first line is about how “commerce on the internet” requires “trusted third parties to process electronic payments.”
That was the problem he was attempting to solve.  
What you are saying is false.  It is also dangerous.  Bitcoin is only a store of value because of the promise that it can be used.  Why not cut up paper into 21 million pieces and stamp each one with a number and pay couriers to transport them about the world if time and transaction costs don’t matter to your “store of value” hypothesis?
I am not a BCH shill - believe me, far from it - but many posts in this sub are starting to make me wonder if you all are hellbent on destroying a good thing.  You don’t care that the earliest mainstream adopters of bitcoin are dropping it?  Unbelievable.

This ^
Crypto assets don’t really have market caps.
The market cap of a company is the market price of a single share times the number of shares issued and outstanding. It is a rough measure of what an entire company is “worth” (so long as a control premium is added). If a purchaser makes a tender offer for a company, you would expect that purchaser to pay more than the market cap to acquire the company. And at the end of the process the purchaser would have a company.
We in crypto use “market cap” to imply something that is false. The “value” of bitcoin is not equal to or greater than the last transact price times all issued and outstanding bitcoin. All holders cannot sell at that price. A purchaser who bought all bitcoin would have something worth nothing, like Satoshi had on day 1. You can sell your BTC for today’s price, but the value of all bitcoin has nothing to do with the transact price times the tiny float exchanged each day.
So it is a meaningless metric. It’s like saying the 100m shitcoins I made yesterday on my laptop are “worth” 1 billion dollars because I managed to sell one to my friend for ten bucks.
You might as well take today’s trading price and multiply it by a random number, because it would be just as meaningful as a determinant of value.

Tell you what.  Take our your phone right now and send a friend in a foreign country 50 dollars.  I will do the same in bitcoin.  Let’s see which one gets the money first, and at less cost.  (Assuming of course that your friend lives in a country that does not block dollar denominated incoming transfers.)
Not having to rely on trusted third parties is the thing.  It isn’t some ancillary benefit.  Think beyond your current environment for one minute and imagine a world in which you are the only person who controls your money.  And we, collectively, the regular folks, are the only people who control what it is worth.  If you don’t see the value in such a system then you will never truly be interested in bitcoin.  Because that is what it is.  The blockchain is just a bunch of debits and credits in the sky.  The trustless part is the revolutionary part.
If you want to cabin your risk buy insurance.  You pay for it every day with every transaction in the form of higher prices charged to you as a consumer, from merchants charged fees from banks and processors, to cover your exposure.  
If you think bitcoin is taking a long time to take hold, I wonder how many years it took our great (great?) grandparents to get used to all those mechanical horses and glowing electrical candle orbs.
I’m not here to satisfy your every objection.  If you don’t think there is anything in this stuff.  Ok to move on.  I’m in.  Crypto had me at hello.

I can take out my cell phone, hit a button and transfer something of value to you at any place in the world - value that you can store, transfer or use to buy things like your local fiat currency.  I can do this almost effortlessly.  It is relatively inexpensive (for example, by relatively I mean can store a billion in bitcoin on a piece of paper; you need a vault and security guards to store that much in gold and you can’t transport it without a tractor trailer).  
And I can do all of this in a cryptographically secure way with no third party to trust or to get in the way of my intentions to transfer that value to you.   
I see all of the above as a real world practical application.  You can’t buy pizza with a Picasso and you can’t get your car washed with a Krugerrand.  You can’t send them to me with your phone either.  Yet they have value.  And so does bitcoin. If you don’t think so sell me yours I’ll give you $100 for each one.  
Why is this so difficult for people?   The use case is that you can use it to store and send value to other people quickly and cheaply with no trust involved.  That’s it.  That’s enough.  It is what makes the thing revolutionary.
End of line.

Bitcoin needs to compete to be the best. The first mover advantage doesn’t mean very much with a product that has such low (but growing) mass adoption. There are a few billion potential users out there that could care less what people say on this sub reddit. Here are a noob’s suggestions:
Bitcoin should be priced in Satoshi or some other small denomination. Not in Bitcoin. There is a major psychological factor at play here that is totally missing. That is why gold isn’t priced by the ton. $14,000 worth of something that changes hands in decimals is unusable for the masses. Move the decimal.
Hear this. Nobody in the real world gives a shit about the raging debate between this guy and his crew and that guy and his crew. People care about value, useability and cost. The in-fighting looks to a noob like child’s play. A user that can send an x coin for 5 cents doesn’t care if there are ten thousand people who mined bitcoins with a Linux distribution or Pentium CPU in 2010. Nobody cares that you collected access to lots of numbers on a blockchain. Want people to use BTC? Fix the problem.
Competition is good. You now have competition. Welcome to the fucking show. This is how the world works. Make a better product and convince people why it is better or your product will die.
So here is my main suggestion. Core needs to scale this thing. Now. Stop screwing around. And somebody had better start getting on CNBC and explaining to all the trillions of dollars worth of potential “use case” people why you are better than the next guy. Because the next guy just copied your code, made it cheaper to use, and has a PR machine that to be perfectly honest is kicking your collective asses. You can’t even get coinbase to support segwit!
Ps - I want you to win. But you will not win if you keep congratulating yourselves. Core needs to get to work. And we all need to get the word out. Or BTC will be Betamax, and we will all be hodling in the wind.

The only thing it is actually incentivizing is people to switch to other coins.

All public blockchains are as immutable as the next community supported fork. 
Bitcoin is more decentralized than ethereum?  Bitmain might disagree.  I hate to break it to you but BTC blocks are hashed into existence by miners made by a single company in China that supports a copy of the pre-August chain, not BTC.  That should scare all of us and is frankly an emergency situation.  How many miners does Bitmain have the ability to shut off today with the flip of a switch?
And the eth nodes are apparently more distributed.  
And...  ethereum is cheaper to send from A to B and faster.  
These be facts.  
What I was saying is that this need not be the case and ethereum could focus on what it was designed to do and bitcoin could actually focus on doing what it was designed to do.  Right now ethereum is a cheaper and faster means of exchanging value electronically.  Sorry if that butt hurts.

Friend, the federal reserve system is just a ledger.  
You may think what bitcoin does is superfluous, but you don’t understand it.  Your bank takes your money, keeps a fraction of it on their balance sheet, and loans it out in multiples to other people - profiting from the 10x levered proceeds on that debt and devaluing the asset you have given them in the process.  The fed, in turn, keeps a giant unaudited ledger in the sky that maintains the net balances for all these banks, through a system of banks owned by the banks, and sits by committee to decide what buttons to press that further devalue your asset.  
This system has only been around for a finger snap in the history of nations.  It works to a degree.  But it sucks trillions in value from you and your assets, and gives it to the ledgerkeepers.  
Bitcoin eliminates the need for all of it.  It can’t be devalued.  It has a limited supply.  It isn’t backed by debt.  If we agree on a price for a bitcoin (say one bitcoin for one corn husker) then we agree.  And we do not need to trust anyone to keep our ledger.  All we have to do is agree that one bitcoin is worth one corn husker.  And we keep our value for ourselves.

The strawman is suggesting that I said anything remotely close to that BTC should “base its entire roadmap” on block size.  
Go back up and read if you want to know my views the posts are not long.  
What I said is that the argument against providing some fee and processing time relief - at a time when new users are choosing their network en masse - doesn’t make a lot of sense.  You respond by saying basically nothing.   
I don’t even understand the argument against increasing the block size while lightning is developed.  And I’m paying very close attention.  All I hear and read is tribal warfare, no logic or sense.

If you have crypto on an exchange your basis is already baked in.  It’s the FMV of the coin when you acquired it.  
If you send it to another exchange the basis doesn’t change.  
If you trade it for something else on that second exchange you realize your gain.  There are two scenarios.  
Scanario 1:   If the trade is crypto to fiat you would use the fiat price to compute the gain (gain is fiat less basis).  
Scenario 2:  If it is a trade for another crypto then your basis in the second coin is the fair market value of the coin you bought (coin 2), and the gain is that fair market value less your basis in the coin you traded (coin 1).  
If your question is, how do you determine the fair market value of coin 2, in scenario 2, the IRS says you need to do it as of the date of the trade “at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.”
To me that means no cherry picking.  So either consistently use the coin1-coin2 rate at the time of trade on exchange 2, or apply a global metric to all basis computations (like the price on the most liquid exchange at 9am for all trading days).  
See Q5-6.  
I’m sure there are accountants on here who could help out with selecting the right way to set the FMV.   Hope this helps.

I don’t.  I value any bitcoin I buy or mine as what I can get for it.  Trying to value all bitcoin is like trying to value double entry bookkeeping in an era where few people actually use it to keep books.  
My point is only that market cap is (unintentionally) misleading to everyone.  The people saying it and the people hearing it.  Bitcoin as a whole is NOT worth 200 billion or whatever other number people are throwing around.  Nobody knows what it is worth. Could be more.  Could be less.  Don’t care.

It is better than money.  That is why we are all here. 
I don’t want to wade into the debate over “should bitcoin be like gold or like PayPal” except to say that I see no reason why both cannot be accomplished.  I see two main barriers to accomplishing both.  
1.  Medium of exchange vs. Volatility.  Volatility (and by this I mean the variance and frequency of price swings) is the enemy of any medium of exchange.  Ask anyone who lives in a country that has experienced/is experiencing hyperinflation and they will tell you that money that changes value rapidly isn’t very good to buy bread with.  But with bitcoin volatility will smooth out over time with more adoption and sophistication.  Crypto markets are in their infancy.  In the real forex and futures markets you don’t get arbitrage opportunities between exchanges that can be captured with a pencil, a piece of paper and manual button presses.  The arbs will equilibrate prices.  And an actual operating futures market will too.  This will happen naturally over time.  It doesn’t trouble me.
2.  Agreement that it has value.   This is the key.  Bitcoin has value today because we all agree it does.  But that could change.  If another coin comes around that does actual useful transactions cheaper, faster and better, then why would the other 98 percent of the world that hasn’t used any crypto pick yours over the better one?  Don’t tell me - or fool yourself into thinking - it’s because this sub has lots of early adopters who really believe and will show them the light.  People vote with their pocket books.  And they adopt things that do what they need.  This is the one that troubles me.  Bitcoin has to deliver on its promise not only to keep a secure, trustless and decentralized ledger with a limited supply of coin - it also has to do it better, faster and cheaper or it will die.  People will stop using it, and what will be left are the early adopters trading with themselves like old men at a coin swap.  
This is the time.  This is the year.  The world is ready and is watching and waiting with their money.  Don’t fuck it up over this “big block little block” nonsense.  Time to get these fees down, process transactions faster, and get out the word that bitcoin is ready (not will be ready) to eat the banking system’s lunch.

Gold doesn’t really have a market cap either.  
It is semantic but important.  Market cap is market capitalization.
Bitcoin and gold aren’t companies.  They do not have capital structures.  There is no market capitalization.  
Taking all the gold in the world, melting it down, pouring it into a couple of Olympic swimming pools and multiplying its weight in ounces by the spot price is as meaningless a measure of the value of all gold in the world as measuring the value of all the numbers locked on and transferred through the bitcoin blockchain by the number of those numbers times the price to sell one on an exchange today.  
Bitcoin has real value.  Its value is that you will buy it from me for something I want. And I will buy it from you for something you want.  We store our value in it, and we agree to exchange it.  And we can do it without some bank taking a cut or controlling us.  It’s really that simple. 
But the total value of “all bitcoin” or “the bitcoin network” cannot be determined by a simple market cap approach.

The use case for bitcoin is that we all agree it has value and will continue to have value in the future.  
As for scalability and cost - Try buying a brick of gold to send to a friend in Zimbabwe (drive to local gold bar dealer, buy at exorbitant markup, transport in car with gun at ready, hand to armed courier, pay for insurance and courier to fly to Zimbabwe, pay for customs clearance in Zimbabwe, if not seized or stolen friend picks up gold bar from armed courier, friend takes gold bar to local gold buyer, sells at huge discount) and you will see the benefits of bitcoin over other value storage media.  
Meantime your Zimbabwean friend could say thanks by sending you a bitcoin from his cell phone at a cost of a couple sats.  
It will scale.  These problems will be solved.  But after reading this Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash debate for so long now I am left with one overriding concern that I will express:   You are both undercutting the very thing that gives Bitcoin its real value - confidence that others recognize it as valuable.

Price will tell you what you can buy of each of the other things you mention with one of the things you have.  
Let’s do a little thought experiment.  BTC has a higher market cap than ETH.  You purchase all of the BTC in the world and hold it in your wallet.   I purchase all the ETH.  What are our wallets worth?  Is yours worth more or less than mine?
That would depend on what we each can do or buy with what’s on that wallet.  Mine might actually have a higher value than yours because I can use it to make cryptokitties.  
You should call it the notional dollar denominated money supply because that is closer to what it is.  But it isn’t value.   To say it is is fooling yourself and misleading to others.  
The market price is the best indicator of the value of one unit of BTC.  Market cap is not the value of all BTC.  
These are facts. If you need a means to measure BTC’s crypto dick against others then come up with one.  I’d love to hear it and use it.  My point is that market cap ain’t it.  
Wish I had more to offer on this topic.  Not much more to say.

Who said I am in crypto to make a quick profit?  
Ever think I wrote what I wrote because I want to improve BTC rather than pay myself on the back and send pictures to my friends of rocket ships and moons?
The sum total of people “in crypto” can fit in the east village of Manhattan or the Hollywood hills.  Your market cap is the paper clip budget for the fortune 100.  This is not a major industry yet.  
I want it to be.  
I’ve been waiting.  What I am saying is that the world will not wait.  
The post is constructive advice.  “Core is doing a great job” doesn’t answer why I can send an ETH or LTC for almost nothing and get it confirmed right away, but to send a few satoshis costs me all of them and takes half a day.  
The market will decide what survives.  Not you.  Not your beliefs.  Time to wake up.  This is what competition is.
Your bitcoin is worth nothing if people don’t want it.  That means the market rules.  And the market will use what is most useful and least expensive.  The rest is nonsense and meme posting.  That was why I posted what I posted.  I hope it is taken in the spirit in which it was intended.
Edit:   I’m sure the core devs are doing a great job.  But they let a fork produce a product that works just like bitcoin and is reputed to be faster and cheaper.  Sure block size is not a panacea.  But it’s in the damned road map so why not just do it as a first step?

Price goes up due to scarcity.  Mining remains profitable, only “profits” (against fiat) are measured in sats not multiples of BTC.  If it doesn’t, people turn off miners and difficulty adjusts.  Or fees come up if block space is tight.  I don’t think the sky is falling.

Eth is designed to do smart contracts.  BTC is designed as a secure, trustless payment system. 
Eth is currently better, faster and cheaper at doing what BTC does than BTC.  I can send an ETH three times, faster and for less money than a singleBTC transaction.  
Now - what I would like to see is that change.  I am a fan of both, for different reasons.

No he is right.  If 200 people have 10,000 BTC each, and the rest of the world wants to increase the supply, then you could have billions of people using the inflated chain and 200 people playing tiddlywinks with each other.  The only way it works is through common understanding that once that inflationary fork happens ALL of the chains are value-less. 
But reality is an important perspective.  Without that social understanding, what you hold is subject to the whim of users you do not control and who may outnumber you.   The social understanding is that we all are in this together or we will all fail miserably.  Bitcoin is a social compact as much as it is a code.  Nothing is immutable that can be changed by human beings.  But it is in everyone’s interest to preserve the 21 million inviolate, so it stands to reason that it will never be changed.  Also, the less you all horde the higher the probability that this will become a reality.  
It is premature to suggest, but not beyond the realm of “sci fi” tin foil hat comprehension, that wars will be fought over this very issue.  For now let’s be happy to build and use a system that works.  And I emphasize - use it.  If you all keep it in your pocket you might find yourselves some day (*we* might find ourselves some day) forked into irrelevance - whether you hold 1/2 BTC or 10,000.

Money has no intrinsic value.  Its value is what you can exchange it for today (medium of exchange) or tomorrow (store of value).  People who do not understand that will never understand Bitcoin.  Cowrie shells were used as money for longer than any other form of it in history.   “Coinage” and then metal backed paper and then fiat were no more than systems invented so elites can exert control over the money supply.  Paper has no more intrinsic value than Bitcoin.  The day we all stop believing in it - and the systems that support it - is the day it is valueless.  Same with gold coinage before it.  And cowry shells before that.  And the wampum that was used by native Americans since the 1500s (and formed part of the currency used by the Dutch to buy the island of Manhattan).  
Bitcoin is a new financial *system* in which participants imbue it with value.  It has value because people will part with valuable things in order to obtain it, and can exchange it if they have it for valuable things.  Without that understanding, of course it looks value-less to the uninformed.  The value of one Bitcoin is what I can buy with it.

Ok so I want to help you.  Lightning network is not ready for you.  It is not point and click.  
Use Bitcoin as it was originally conceived (send your BTC on chain to the recipient).  It works extraordinarily well, is user friendly and is safe and secure.  If for some reason you need faster transaction times for a particular send, you can convert your BTC to Litecoin on a one-off basis for your transaction as needed.   It is rare that you would ever really need to do that today.  
In a year or two lightning might be in a place where non-technical people can comfortably use it.  
BCH has centralization concerns and that is why you should consider not using it.  It has issues at its very core.  Many may disagree with that and that is fine.  It is a free world.  But the point of this whole thing is to get away from having your money controlled by a single person or group.  BCH was not an organic development like BTC was.  It was a sponsored event and it still looks to me like it is controlled by faketoshi, Ver and Bitmain.  DYOR on that one and make your own judgment.

A hardware wallet is just a seed that makes numbers but keeps those numbers (private keys) off the internet.  Anyone with the seed or numbers can spend bitcoin.  There is no way to geofence that.  There is no central bitcoin server that can deny access to BTC associated with an address if a person has the seed or numbers.

Good article but I have to say wading through a multi page article in Medium on ASIC resistance that does not discuss ProgPoW is pretty disappointing.  Whether it is good for Bitcoin to switch to an ASIC resistant algo is another story and is open for debate, but it’s not like there isn’t a solution out there.  Why write on ASIC resistance without even discussing the only real ASIC resistant algo?
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:40:46
Bitcoin has value because people agree it does.  It is that simple.  This is the nature of money.  Bitcoin is not a stock.  It is not an asset.  It is a system.  And the participants on that system agree to exchange other things, like goods and dollars, for BTC. That is why it has value.  If you don’t understand that then you are sipping through too tiny a mental straw.

It isn’t political.  It is the fundamental economic basis for the blockchain and the essence of its security.  They did not know a thing about it.  ETH is a proof of work blockchain with a new ASIC, high difficulty and marginal profitability for miners given a stagnant and declining price.  There is a serious question to be discussed about reducing mining rewards at this time?  I don’t think so.  
At least with BTC I know I can buy a miner and the rewards will be there, subject to competition from other miners.  With ETH it’s POS next month, next year, two years; it’s ASIC resistant but it’s not - welcome ASICS; block reward is x, no it’s y, no wait does someone want to debate it so we can understand the issue?  It has become extremely difficult to take seriously anything they say when it comes to major economic issues.  People therefore will not invest in securing their blockchain.  
Devs should be keenly focused on the one thing no crypto project can do without:  a secure blockchain.  The ETH community these days acts like POS is a thing, and miners are some annoyance that must be dealt with harshly so that bags can be expanded to a maximum degree until POS arrives.   Well, POS isn’t a thing and there is no telling when it will arrive.  And while you are all dreaming up equations in the sky to be implemented “soon” we have been here on the ground spending money securing your network.  
What more do miners want?   A thank you would be nice.  Prog PoW, a consistent and profitable issuance rate and a concrete timeline to POS so rational investment decisions can be made would be even nicer. 
Meantime I’ll spend my resources mining something else.

Ask yourselves this - if someone comes on Reddit to make a post telling you it is the “last chance to sell” why would they do it?
1.  They want you to sell to them.  
2.  They want you to sell to someone else because they have a short position (this includes a position in another coin that hopes to gain market share).  
3.   Some men just want to watch the world burn.  
No matter which is correct for a given post, the takeaway is that the poster has a motive, and it is not in your interest to listen.

They didn’t even understand the issue.  A project that can willy nilly alter the fundamental economic structure of the blockchain in a few weeks based on the whim of a group of disinterested developers — after taking a poll and reading posts by a bunch of bagholders on reddit who wouldn’t know a miner if it fell on their face and only want their bags to get bigger at the expense of chain security — is far from what I would call an immutable chain.  They should be ashamed.  I had high hopes for ETH.  No longer.  That can change but it will be changed based on future conduct of the developers.  Right now it is a shit show and the only public voices are (1) the horde of Redditors clamoring for their bags of free interest on top of the bags of free ETH they already have and (2) the developers who don’t seem to know that Rome is burning around them.  
With all the negative talk about mining in the ETH bag holder community I wouldn’t mine it any more if you paid me.  I certainly wouldn’t mine it if you don’t.

I need a lesson from you like I need a nose on my ass.  
Bitcoin is not an investment.  It is a new financial system.  One in which financial “experts” who have been stealing from the masses for generations with fractional reserve banking and inflation have no place.  Get used to it.  The fire sticks are on top of the hill as we speak.  
And remember, that financial Mecca you hold dear was first a tiny capital (acquired with wampum) of a backwater nation that began with an ideal among some farmers ruled by the iron fist of a tyrant.  Ideas matter.  It was King George who should have questioned his own bearings, not George Washington or Alexander Hamilton or Thomas Jefferson or James Madison - the zealots with their silly ideas.  
We do not care if you root for us.  We care only that you buy in, hodl and use - or get out of the way.  Because you are a dinosaur.   You may see the asteroid coming a mile away but you can’t stop it.  Your extinction is a matter of time.  This is the gospel according to Bayminer.  
In all seriousness you should stick around and read and learn.   There are many smart (brilliant) people in this space.  It has a lot to offer.   That you think this whole thing means speeding up your back office suggests you have been listening to a little too much Jamie Dimon bullshit and don’t actually have a clue what you are talking about.   Blockchain without decentralization and trustlessness is just a database.  The secret sauce is the other stuff.  Read up a little.  And think for yourself.  
Ps we did not evolve from the Neanderthals.  We occupied the same space as them until they died out. You might read a little on that too.

“Quantum theory yields much, but it hardly brings us close to the Old One’s secrets. I, in any case, am convinced He does not play dice with the universe.”
That is as close to calling something a joke as one will ever read from the pen of a physicist.  If you need a translation, he is saying to Born, “you all have designed a nice little predictive tool but as a theory it is a house built on a foundation of sand.”
But in truth he was probably right.  So my analogy is inapt.  A better analogy is: Newton thought you could turn lead into gold.  The point being that even the most gifted mind can make mistakes.  
Vitalik may well operate on the same mental plane as both of them.  But no human is right 100 percent of the time.  A biased input will yield a biased output in the even the most powerful of mental computers.

Make fork of coin A - it is coin B but we will call it ACash - and hash it like there is no tomorrow.  
Short coin A on cash settled futures market in Chicago. 
Sell coin A on spot market for ACash.  This depresses the price of A and boosts the price of ACash.  
Then...  instantaneously and simultaneously ... 
Shut off all coin A pools you own.  
Stop making coin A miners.  
Brick all existing coin A miners with disabling virus through back door or pushed firmware upgrade.
Kill coin A.  
Make money on rise of ACash and short of coin A.

I like your post but I have to be honest I lost the thread of your point.  If it is that one should choose investments to maximize expected returns then I agree with you.  Separately, I also agree there are many worthy and revolutionary technologies and causes other than crypto.  
Beyond that I’m not sure exactly what you are saying here.  
My point is that this is a paradigm shift.  It may fail, sure, but the investment metrics you are applying in an effort to rationalize it do not apply.  Satoshi Nakamoto did not invest in Bitcoin.  He created it.  And we use it.  Why?  Because it has the potential to free us from the money skimmers and balance sheet manipulators that call themselves financial institutions.  “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”  (Nakamoto, Genesis).  That’s where all the smart guys on “the street” with their free cash flow metrics and big boy bravado found themselves.
I believe my children will live in a world of financial freedom that we do not yet fully comprehend.  And I think the smart bankers like Jamie Dimon know it.  They are Ma Bell.  Bitcoin is the internet.  Times they are a changing.  It’s almost palpable.

There is a .notdef glyph to the right of the B.  Why?  It is unique in that it is the only symbol that covers another.  This must be a clue, not just a failed representation of the summation E in the white paper.  
The log scaling can’t be order or frequency.  (The largest words are not first, last, lowest frequency or highest frequency).  Perhaps rotation/orientation or distance from whatever notdef is in the white paper (notdef as the first word)?

Money is a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account.  
igajdeed- You may be confusing Marx’s labor theory of value with the question “what is money?”  OP is correct that one thing money is is a “tool for measuring GDP.”  That’s the unit of account part.   GDP is *measured* in dollars (or Yen or whatever).  
But OP there is no requirement that something exceed global GDP to be considered “money.”   Money can be casino chips in Vegas.  And it is.  And they are.  
Bitcoin is money if two or more people agree it has value, exchange it as such, and use it to measure that value relative to other things.  Bitcoin is, therefore, already money and has been since its inception.

You don’t need a wise man with bitcoin.  What you are describing is fiat money and the wise man is the bank (although cigarettes also have intrinsic value because you can smoke them).  
The dilemma in your example - “how do we all agree on a ledger without a wise man to verify it” - is the very thing that Bitcoin solves.  
Bitcoin eliminates the need for wise men and their trusted ledgers.  That’s the point of it.  Miners are not trusted parties.  In math we trust, because we can prove it for ourselves.

There is no question crypto impacts interstate commerce, and when states like New York regulate crypto they are impacting interstate commerce.  
States generally can’t discriminate against out of state interests or unduly burden interstate commerce.  This is based on the “dormant commerce clause” (which really isn’t a constitutional clause at all - but it stems from Congress’s delegated power to regulate interstate commerce).  What is an “undue burden” in a given context is very fact specific.  I doubt state licensing of bitcoin businesses would ever be struck down on this basis.  Furthering a rational state interest is usually enough to overcome its application.  States, after all, are the repository of general police powers in the US constitutional structure - not the feds.  States usually can do what they want unless it runs afoul of some constitutional prohibition (like the ones in the bill of rights) or properly enacted Congressional act (like 31 USC 5103 in rastanikoten’s hypothetical).  
So you are probably right but there is some nuance you’re missing.

To move a billion in gold you need a forklift, an armored truck and guys with machine guns.  
To move a billion in BTC you need a phone and a piece of paper.  
Enough with the transaction fees.  It costs 3.50 to take 10 bucks out of an ATM in many cities.  Banks charge you to hold your money (account fees), charge you to send it (e.g, wire fees) and charge you when you ask for it back so you can use it (ATM fees).  Bitcoin is doing just fine.

rastanikoten - That would be struck down on a field or conflict preemption theory not a dormant commerce clause theory (US dollars are legal tender and must be accepted for all debts, public and private, by federal law - congress has occupied the field of whether dollars may be accepted without a license, and has passed a law saying so).  
But going to your direct question - benefitting “mystatedollars” and burdening “outofstatedollars” would be discriminatory so the case is much closer than the real world case we are talking about.  The dormant commerce clause is on its way out.  But your “mystatedollar” vs “outofstatedollar” example is close to a classic case.

No there is only enough gold in the world to fit in a couple of Olympic swimming pools.  Countries just put it in vaults and moved bricks about.

This isn’t complicated.  Bitmain can buy some BCH for cash, sell large holdings of BTC for BCH (driving down the price of BTC and driving up the price of BCH), sell the original cash purchased BCH for BTC (capturing their profit in BTC) and let the market re-equilibrate.  Any whale with market moving holdings in two coins can do this.  
It is a thinly traded, illiquid, unregulated, nascent market right now.  That is why you should stop buying and selling based on what they do.  Buy if you believe in the thing on a 1-5-10 year horizon and sell if you don’t.

The document was submitted by the lawyers for the estate, not Wright.  Boies Schiller is one of the best litigation law firms in the world.  If they made this kind of error it will be almost as grave a mistake as David Boies being unable to answer a question in the Supreme Court argument of Bush v. Gore.  That is to say: mistakes like this can and do happen.  Lawyers are not lie detectors.  
But you can all assure yourselves of something.  There will be a forensic analysis of all the documents in that case.  Including this email.  The answer will be found.  I see no reason why the plaintiff would forge an email demonstrating that Wright had the idea behind Bitcoin in a suit against Wright for less than 50 percent of the bitcoin mined by W&amp;K.  His incentive would be to forge an email demonstrating that Kleiman was Satoshi.  But that is not what we have.

It isn’t in the constitution.  In fact the Constitution gives congress the power to regulate the value of money.

John has three cars.  They are rare cars; the only 3 left in the world.  Everybody wants them.  
Jane definitely wants one of John’s cars, and will pay dearly for it.  She offers her monies to him and he agrees to the exchange.  John gives her the keys.  
Jack wants one of John’s cars as well.  John insists that Jack pay double what Jane paid, but after Jack hands over his greater quantity of monies he gets the keys to one, too.  
Sultan is the only person rich enough to be able to induce John to part with his last remaining car.  Sultan pays one meeelion dollars in monies.  He gets a set of keys.  
How many cars did John start out with?  
When Jane and Jack and Sultan complete their transactions, how many cars are left?
(I’ll fill you in the answer to both is 3).   
BTC very similar to this example, Sir.  Lots of people wanting to buy BTC can make the price go up but that does not make more bitcoin.  Just like the cars - no matter how many monies are spent, there are only three cars to buy.

You are wrong.  They didn’t know at the highest levels at the largest banks and in the bowels of the economic modeling engines of the Fed.  
I disagree with the notion that any abstraction can fully and completely model human behavior over time and on a mass scale.  Game theory, like classicical economic theory and monetary theory (and Marxist theory and the Hobbesian state of nature and DSM-IV and even the rantings of Freud and Jung) is a tool to aid in understanding, but it rarely provides the answer to the complex game of life.  A single human brain cannot accurately be modeled, let alone the interaction of all of them over time.  Brains can be abstracted, and models can be constructed to characterize those abstractions based on a set of rules, but the answers are predicated on a flawed assumption - that brains and the behavior they drive can be reduced to a predictive formula.
Game theory “works” for computers.  Not people.  It is an interesting study and informative mental exercise, though, and yes it is a study I have loosely kept in touch with for 25 years.
Fortunately, people aren’t objects.  Their trajectories cannot be modeled with the precision of physics.  We can open up tiny windows with greater or lesser degrees of predictive accuracy.  But there is no grand theory of human behavior and game theory certainly isn’t it.  People can’t be modeled.  If they could those making the models would rule the world just as sure as Ghenghis Khan did.  But they do not.  They sit in windowless rooms writing out complex equations that prove much but predict very little.

I’m going to name my dog Bitcoin.  If you send coins to him it’s on you, not me.

I love guys who think they can take their tie off after a long day and pop in here like they’re some kind of primatologist objectifying and judging what they see.  Guess what: this isn’t “Gorillas in the Mist.”   What you see here is your evolutionary future, Mr. Money man.  Watch and learn.

It takes 3 days to send an international wire and costs a hundred bucks.

It doesn’t have to be perfect.  Just better.  And it is.

Whales can only manipulate weak hands.  To sell high they need a dumb buyer.  To buy low then need a chicken little seller.  The antidote to whale manipulation is collective common f-ing sense.  
Hodl it.  Use it.  STFU.

All the dollars in all the pockets amount to about 40% of the “money” in circulation (using M1, the strictest definition of money).  It’s about 8% of M2.
Most money is just an entry on a ledger, not cash.  That’s why Roosevelt declared a bank holiday.  Not enough dollars to go around so he had to stop a run on the banks.  
You don’t need to take my word for it.  Take his (from his fireside chat on banking explaining why the holiday was needed):  “In other words, the total amount of all the currency in the country is only a small fraction of the total deposits in all of the banks....  By the afternoon of March 3rd scarcely a bank in the country was open to do business....  It was then that I issued the proclamation providing for the nationwide bank holiday, and this was the first step in the Government’s reconstruction of our financial and economic fabric.”
The dollar *was* “down.”
Edit:   There is nothing wrong with having a point of view.  You should put your post back up.

This is awesome.  Good for you.
