Banks will do a manual recount of ATM money and match it with the digital transaction records to verify these types of complaints; they do happen occasionally. No worries OP!

Hopefully I'm not too late to this, but I was wondering if I'm looking to hold at most $2k worth of bitcoin as a short-medium term investment and for occasional spending, is it necessary to use an offline wallet on my computer, or would 2 passwords and SMS confirmation on blockchain.info be secure enough?

So in terms of price and usability, what do you have that convinces me to switch from coinbase to vault for my btc?

Lost it at "Final Balance: 27,365.13378008 BTC" Like a paper bag on a monument.

Looks good, although kind of pricey... ($65 sweatshirt?) I'd personally go for something more subtle, like the iPhone case.

I think they'll either just let them sit there out of circulation or dump them through an exchange.

I assume the API will be down as well?

As someone who does all his fiat banking with BofA, I've had no problem with their handling of my money in relation to purchasing, selling, or dealing with bitcoin. As far as I'm concerned, that's all they need to do!
