yeah, its not worth the heartache to find out one day the hardware was compromised.
There's a lot of money to gain it you can hack these hardware wallets to "randomly" create a seed from a premade list of seeds the attacker has uploaded.
Just saying, I would barely feel safe ordering one directly from the manufacturer as I'm not sure if it was intercepted in delivery.

Lightning network is going to make most of the alts obsolete.  Want bitcoin to do a neat trick you only saw this one other alt do? Just roll a lightning network channel that performs the same ability. Return to "normal" bitcoin when you are done.
I would say almost 99% of the alts can be replaced easily.

You sound very toxic to this sub.  Not sure you have any good intentions for being here.  If you'do like to discuss the technology this sub is very welcoming. If you'd like to just spread fucked up discussion because you have an axe to grind then most people here will not take you very seriously. 
Btw- bitcoin is still relatively new. You haven't missed the boat. It's still in its infancy and segwit/Lightning network was just made possible less than 6 months ago! Big things are coming in 2018.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:59:07

Picture the LN as a customized environment designed to behave however the participants want it to behave. If you want your coins to link to real estate tokens that unlock timeshare locks on the doors of a beachside condo for 48 hrs, you can make that happen.  If you want a payment channel that links victory points from an online video game that pays bounties for online kills, you can do that.
The lightning network takes advantage of the segwit fix we've been asking for for years! We can now peg these alternative environments to the bitcoin blockchain so the possibilities are amazing!!
I'm sorry but I do not have any links that I prefer over any others.  There are far more knowledgeable old guys in this sub that can point you in the right direction.

Their grand plan is tanking.  The only thing BitcoinCash had was bigger blocks to make transaction fees cheaper.  Their developers just made a copy of the BTC code and edited it to allow for larger blocks and they *still* managed to royally fuck that up.  Very embarrassing to fuck up so badly while the entire world watched and shook their heads in disbelief.  
Lightning Network just made BCH's pitiful attempt look like amateur hour.  Lightning scales 10000:1 to their hacked up solution.  **Make** **no** **mistake**, **BCH** **is** **obsolete**. **It's** **got** **nothing** **but** **PR** **now**.
BitcoinCash was an attempted hostile takeover of the bitcoin protocol.  They were really hoping their shitcoin was going to fool people rushing into crypto for the first time and not understanding the difference.  And they were *really* hoping the Lightning Network wasn't going to be ready so soon.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:05:12
That was your opportunity to put forth a reasonable argument on why we should believe a random redditor who hasn't been a part of this project for very long.
You seem to be a little confused. Bitcoin has been called all these things you have called it many times before. It's still here providing value to millions after years (almost a decade) of growing pains and developer solutions to those pains.
If you have some technical knowledge of a weakness in the protocol you'do like to help us with we'do be all ears.
We just don't have time for haters. Your talking points are all tired arguments that have been debated before. You offer nothing new and that's why we bring up your noob status around here.  You seem like an uneducated child rushing into an adult conversation with a serious lack of knowledge about the protocol.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:18:55

We really don't need the Doomsday you are painting.  Just another financial crisis could cause market panic and major corrections that cause the government to issue another round of serious bailouts, inflating the currency massively overnight.
Everyone will "feel" like the government restored order and everything is going back to normal but anyone willing to actually look will see the hidden massive debt that is baked into the tax burden of future taxpayers. 
$1mil bitcoins will happen, it's just a matter of years, not decades.

Man, if I had a satoshi for everytime bitcoin was dying...
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:35:51


That made me chuckle but totally not necessary.  Bitcoin was born out of the disgust on how the government manipulated the markets during and immediately after the housing crises of 2008.  
It was the catalyst that set the wheels in motion!  Everyone points to the white paper and the genesis block but the true beginnings of the concept of bitcoin rose out of the anger during that crises.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:20:12


Lol. Oh you've read **the** paper cryptocurrencies are based on, huh? :)

This is just silly.  So we can say sovereign wealth funds are "financial weapons" now because they can be allocated to fund things we do not like?  Do you think you'll like where this line of reasoning leads to?
Are we going to say that any wallet containing more than 10,000 BTC could be seen as a "financial weapon?"  I do not like the sound of that.  Money has always been seen as "soft power" in that its a nonviolent way to coerce people to engage in a mutual beneficial relationship.  
I think ZH is just using the crises to criticize US intervention in Venezuela.  Investing billions into a country is the use of soft power.  Money is used to buy weapons but it is not a weapon itself.  It is a tool.


Maduro fucked up by running his country into the ground.  This was an exceptional feat as it was by far one of the wealthiest countries in South America when he took over for Chavez.  
The reality is that Venezuela is now in humanitarian crises mode.  People are starving in the streets, the wealth of all its citizens continues to collapse as their fiat is inflated into oblivion.  Human trafficking has rushed in to take advantage of tens of thousands.
These people need the dictator out (like yesterday) and an emergency injection of billions to prevent further starvation and societal collapse.  This is not US imperialism.  It's humanitarian aid and doesn't need to be vilified.
Also, buy bitcoin.  Those that did were able were able to fly out with their wealth.

You act like normal segwit doesnt provide what 2x is attempting; the ability to build proxy layers onto the protocol.

You are correct. There is exorbitant costs associated with the physical transportation and storage of certificates that really don't matter as most investors never elect to take receipt of the physical paper. The physical assets still must be stored and cataloged for the few investors that do request physical transfers.
So ownership is really just updated on a digital ledger for the great majority of stock purchases. Hey! Where have we heard about digital ledgers before I wonder?

Give it time.  This is big for the true heroes of the bitcoin community, the developers.  They are the ones that will play with this code and create fantastic new apps.  
It's the community that makes the crypto and the bitcoin developers have been donating their time and effort for almost a decade.  The LN will be another tool in their toolkit.

This!! The crypto exchange markets do not coordinate!! So this is still a "small" market where the hedge fund players are running game on the small fish all day every day.
If exchanges do not coordinate (which is what you have in a decentralized market) then actors will play across exchanges, coordinating buys and sells to dupe the novice traders trying to make a quick flip.
It's like rope-a-dope for cryptotraders.  The harder they try, the deeper they fall into the trap.

You spent that entire time talking down to me without presenting a single argument addressing your principal statement.




I believe the lightning network channel system doesn't have ruin decentralization but can accommodate a "network effect" linking smaller channels together in a larger network.  This would create a model not unlike how all internet traffic works now.
Lightning network channels will essentially be LAN networks linked together to route payments just like the interwebs route traffic.  So it will be like six degrees of paying Kevin Bacon, all routed automatically with higher level layering protocols built on top of Lightning tech.
What's more this wouldn't be that difficult to roll out so I'd imagine this would solve your worry about voiding decentralization by accepting faster payments.

You don't have to download the entire blockchain to participate in the network.  And now, the Lightning network allows for people to just keep the relevant info needed to establish a channel.  From there they can just keep what's needed to play off-chain

20 years ago CNN and Fox News wasn't rushing to explain the world by focusing on what Twitter or Reddit was reporting.
It's difficult to see it because tech moves very fast but old institutions do not.  Cable news is struggling to stay relevant to the fast and cheap production of YouTube videos, Twitter updates, and Reddit editorials.  Cable Networks are posting 10 minute clips on YouTube and putting multiple 30 second ads.  They just don't get it and they are struggling to stay relevant.
Most millennials are cable cutting.  That means that an entire generation will no longer gets it's primary news and entertainment from a regional cable provider (and the slew of corporate partners of said ISP provider)
You see "a flaming shithouse of data dystopia" while I see the chaos that naturally comes about when old institutions begin to die off.  It's going to be scary but anything worth a damn always is!

I beg to differ. The price is set by the buyer *and* the seller together.  So if a seller found a buyer at $1 million and another buyer found a seller at $0.1, technically both would be correct then and only then.

Most likely a major Bcash investor/partner that Ver convinced to spend their own money to keep the lie alive that larger block sizes were needed.
Love seeing history like this. It's so subtle at first and yet so obvious when you know what to look for.
Friendly reminder to anyone not paying attention, Bcash was a quick cash grab with the attempt to hijack the open source project of bitcoin and fool noobs into investing in Bcash thinking it was really bitcoin.  
**Bcash** **is** **now** **obsolete** as its bigger block sizes cannot come close to competing with the lightning network.

Dumb response is dumb. All encryption will eventually be broken. The protocol allows for this as a consensus can push to implement the next level of encryption that has not yet been broken.
If you have read much on bitcoin (or have been around long enough) you would know this.  Breaking the encryption is not the end of the world provided that people have upgraded.
You seem to have a very limited understandin of crypto and physics.  It' is always an arms race and you must pay attention for when it's time to abandon one type of encryption for another.  
You are suggesting that bitcoins encryption was meant to stay in place forever which shows how much you know.

They have done nothing but build a secondary layer for exponentially enlarging the capacity of the network when it comes to fast settlements and advanced payment channels.
Have fun with your shitcoin, Bcash. That garbage has already been made obsolete and it's not even through its first year!  The lightning network can already do everything your temporary block size increase set out to do, except it actually can do it better and cheaper! 
Good luck promoting your knock-off bitcoin!  BTC has more developers and a better community that's not spreading FUD ;)

That's ok. There are quite a few layers at work here. First you need to remember that lightning network is really still in is first year (beta lightning work was late 2017/early 2018). So all on 2019 will be finding out how amazing it implement into other platforms we all know and love. Micro payments through the browser, exchanging virtual goods for mbtc on gray markets, vending options irl, etc...
Then you have to remember that people are going to lose their shit when the block reward halves again in 2020.  By then, every miner in the world will be competing for 6 btc instead of 12 every ten minutes or so.  The freshly minted btc will command a higher value per btc based on the mining hashing power invested to harvest it.
Then you have good old central planning inflation and how good politicians are with paying for things on social credit (loans made to pay for things based on the understanding that the taxpayers will pay it back over decades). This allows for buying in excess today and inflating the currency to pay for it a little cheaper tomorrow.  This will make btc relatively more valuable to all fiat currency (as it already is).
Also, this year governments started accepting tax oligations through crypto.  Local governments are allowing its residents to pay their taxes in btc which is the start of the real utility that we were finally waiting for.  If you can pay your government in crypto it's value will solidify as a new hedge against inflation.
Lots of factors are creating more momentum for the protocol ramping back up in 2020.

I think forks are a feature.  Bitcoin Cash refused to embrace segwit so they wanted to go against the consensus.  That's a personal decision every actor in the market can choose for themselves. It's true liberty in that no one person is disenfranchised.  If change is wanted by the majority, they can signal for the change. If they change but the majority does not, they have their own blockchain all to their own.
Change is bound to happen and the fork process allows for change where anyone and everyone gets to vote what they want.  If new innovation is discovered in this field then more than likely someone will push to change the bitcoin protocol and another fork will happen.  
Many in the community see this as a feature.  It allows for maximum liberty to the individual.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:04:55


I'm sorry but this is an ignorant statement.


Literally anyone can fork the code to create what they want.  You just have to convince others your version is superior somehow to the code they are voluntarily using.  If you cant convince anyone else to use your code, maybe it wasn't that good of an idea?


Some investors what to use the best.  


Again, retarded comment because you cant replicate on the same protocol.  If it's not on the same protocol it's not the same coins. I cant believe you are not understanding this.

Wake up, man. The fiat currencies are plummeting all the time.it's a constant inflation.  That's why only a few years ago you could buy bitcoin for only a few hundred.  A few years before that you could pick them up for $30 each.

Then you are no longer talking of bitcoins. You are commenting on derivatives in the bitcoin market.  Nobody says corn futures are actual corn. It's a promise to pay a certain amount FOR corn at a future date.


Bitcoin was never about a monopoly on the blockchain technology.  Anyone can make a paper copy of a deed on a house.  It doesn't mean that deeds to houses lose value. THE bitcoin will most likely be more valued because it's the longest running blockchain.  The protocol is like a fingerprint in that there will always be Coke and Nike in a world full of knock-offs, anyone can easily say, "I will only accept this protocol"
