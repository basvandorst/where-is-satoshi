Sounds like you need a new bank.

How does this work? The tipping on Reddit.
Edit: Scrolled through your comments and found a link describing it. How do you safely connect your wallet to Reddit though? Sounds sketch. Forgive me, I’m very new to all this. I don’t even own btc at the moment. I just started traveling down the rabbit hole.

I want one of those coins they have in japan. They come in the little plastic bubble from coin operated turn handle machines. Are these available online? They aren’t a large amount of btc. They have a holographic sticker on the back that you peel off and reveal the private key.

Thank you for the clarification.

I’m saying there is finite amount. So what happens when it gets wiped out
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:55:04
Will never happen.
@_date: 2019-12-11 09:22:56
Did they steal cash or BTC? If BTC, does it go back, or is it gone?
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:51:51
Ok so what the hell is the plan if stuff like this keeps happening? How is that sustainable?
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:53:27
Apparently not. How about you explain instead of being an asshat?

Paper advertisement is still a thing. Print flyers about bitcoin with easy to understand facts and stats and just hang them up at ya stations, bars, pet stores, liquor stores, phone poles, etc. Going somewhere for Christmas or new year? Hang up a flyer if you stop for gas. Some people don’t get on YouTube.
