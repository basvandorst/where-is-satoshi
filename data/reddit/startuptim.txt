How long isn't out account active?  And who do I email?  Their whole system is automated and a piece of shit honestly.

Ive heard lots of recent horror stories of people wiring Kraken money and they never get credit and Kraken never makes good.

Where is the best way to make $10 to 100k spends at a time on acquiring bitcoin for USA peeps and safely?  Coinbase has $250 a week limits.

Mine is 4 years old and 250 week limit is junk.  I contacted their support 3 weeks ago and They said my limit does not reflect my account age and positive status and they were escalating it.
Then nothing.  No way for me to respond, no limit increase, nothing.  I literally have deep 6 figures I'd like to spend on Bitcoin.

Hey all!
A friend of mine is looking to buy $10k - $100k BTC at a time, yet I'm at his house right now and Coinbase says he has a $250 weekly limit. As he is looking to do potentially 6 figures per transaction, this obviously won't work.
Where would the best place be for him to buy Bitcoin, right now/tomorrow, starting with $10k - $100k per transaction?
He is from the United States if that matters. He is also from a state where Coinbase's GDAX isn't available, and Coinbase itself has a limit on his account, despite he validated literally everything you can validate.  Also, Gemini has some recent horror stories of wire transfers.  
If possible, he'd really, really like to just make an account tomorrow, verify whatever, and buy a lot.

Thanks for the response!  I just texted him the URL.
Could you let me know any pros/cons of what you think of them?  Also, are they insured, secured, etc?  If you don't mind, how do they stack up to Coinbase (which is what we always hear about)?
Many thanks in advance!

He bought $250 via his bank account on Coinbase, and $50 via his credit card.  Now it says he has to wait a week to do $250+$50 again.  Then he has to do that for 6 weeks to potentially increase his limit.
But that can't be right.  Waiting 6 weeks with paltry amounts just to raise it from $250?  
He is looking to invest a lot, starting with a single BTC buy, and then do $50k in the next few days, and then I'm guessing $50-$100k a month.  He even spoke of wanting to do $500k in a chunk as well.
I feel as if we are missing something.  How on earth do people buy large amounts if Coinbase limits you to $250 initially, and then likely limits you to another tiny amount increased from there?
