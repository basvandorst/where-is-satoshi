Backing up anycoindirct.eu They're pretty cool especially when you live in the Belgian/Netherlands regions

Oh I can assure you that I wanted to but alas I had to wait until my 18th birthday and I had to convince my father that this wasn't one big ponzi scheme.

My humble opinion would be to sell it on eBay. Cash out. Use the money to buy Bitcoins and help Bitcoin to get globally accepted :)

Bitstamp since I live in Europe it's stamp or that one german exchange.

I hope that when this happens I do not even have to think about having to cash out and people gaze at me you have WHOLE Bitcoins? Flabbergasted yup let a man dream..

I use Authy for two factor authentication so that should be set.
I'm thinking about storing 1 Bitcoin on a paper wallet for my dad as he finally understands that this is something 'longterm' and not a get rich quick trip
Any advice for cold storaging his part?

Great that you're going to teach them about Bitcoin! I'm studying Applied Computer Physics and I'm going to present my paper tomorrow! In crypto we trust!

Oh my father knows about lows when he and I thought it would be a good idea to buy a Little Single  from BFL.. Two more weeks is still a funny catchphrase here at casa del CptShock. Thank God for chargebacks. Yes I'm completely aware of the irony here :)

The next crash might be a drop from 350 to 300. It's hard to predict the future and I am so bullish to the extend that even $300 is cheap imho

Thanks a lot for the information, I sure do appreciate it!
Over time I have found that you can never know enough. Thanks.
