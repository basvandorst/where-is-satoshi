Please, never sleep ever again.

Thanks for this.

Yes, most, if not all of us are more tech-savvy than the average, and might think bitcoin's progress is slow. But five years ago, it was nothing. What other form of currency or trade ever achieved that?

Hey, me too! At least we finally got Google Music ;P

If he mined a lot at the very beginning, he must have lots of bitcoins. Now, he CAN spend them; he just CAN'T sell them all at once and crash the price.

Even if I don't make any money out of it, I only want Bitcoin (or any other Cryptocurrency) to succeed because I just hate seeing banks with their ridiculous fees and their fear towards progress. 
Besides, some of my friends have hobbies they spend a lot of money on, or simply can't keep their money in their pockets, constantly buying useless over expensive things. Why wouldn't MY hobby be Bitcoin? I'm having fun here, and so many talented people already invested so much of their time building every single component and feature of this technology, I can't believe it will all go away.

I think Dogecoin has it's place here because it's mainly used for tips.

I would just like to see Google implement Bitcoin in Google Wallet, charge little to no fees, and kick PayPal's ass.
Edit: They do consider it -&gt; [link](

Valve accepting Bitcoin would be huge IMO.
Let's start with Bitcoin, and wait a bit for the shitty alts, shall we?
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:32:18
But new cryptocurrencies should at least have something new, something different. There's just so many useless alt-coins already. Some people just clone one, change a few variables and hope enough people fall for it so they can make a quick buck. That's can't be good, can it?
So, in a way, cryptocurrencies ARE like precious metals; each one should be unique!

Which host are you talking about?

Is it running on a battery with solar panel? Do you need to keep the lights on or does it last a whole night?

Have a look at [Copay]( It is developed by BitPay, a Bitcoin equivalent to PayPal.

After almost 2 years, i recently got a refund from BFL. Never thought i'd see that money again. I think they had to play nice after being shut down by the FTC.
I actually made money from this since USD/CAD moved in my favour. Pretty sweet but i'll never be this stupid again.

Some people sold their bitcoins because of the Core/BU conflict, but many more stopped investing more into Bitcoin, myself included. The price reacts to that.

Employees can go elsewhere too, just like the clients/users

You must be very successful in your endeavours with that attitude

You have no credibility, don't make stupid predictions.
