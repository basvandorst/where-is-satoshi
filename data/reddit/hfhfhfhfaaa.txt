He means there are more buyers than sellers at the current market price. Everyone understands.

Segwit allows 4MB max blocks in exchange for 1.7x transaction volume. Onchain scaling would allow 4x transactions for the same size blocks.
Segwit is useful as a stepping stone to LN, but it is a horrible scaling method. And the lack of any routing network makes LN useless as a short term scaling solution too.

That's not entirely fair: there are core parts of LN that aren't total vaporware and may actually be useful.


Script-heavy transactions don't move bitcoin more efficiently, so this is actually wrong. But even if it was right, it suggests that onchain scaling is better, since it gives the transaction increase without opening the network up to 4x blocksize attacks.

It took Classic less than a week to put together a 2 MB fork, and Gavin documented the changes in a blog post. But sure, lets give the Core developers a couple of months more to obstruct a blocksize increase by encouraging them to add random, useless and non-essential crap to their list of proposed improvements for the miners.

If BTC was like the US economy, 90 percent would be used for speculative trading, off-market asset storage and purposes other than making actual day-to-day payments that get measured as GDP.
Assuming 2.1 million remain to serve the use of value transfer. If all of those coins are exchanged 1 time each day on average, that is 46.5 billion in value transferred daily, and the value of a coin would have to be at least 22,702 USD.

If the wishlist includes hard forking the entire Core development team into the spinning glass prison from Superman II, that would be an acceptable delay.

I'm a bitcoin user and would LOVE to see Core fulfill the promise of bitcoin too. But the network has been at capacity for six months, segwit is still not launched and there is no planned date for a HF blocksize increase. Tons of meaningless personal drama and developer infighting though....
It's very easy to see why people are upset. Eyeball a growth chart for ether sometime and try not to notice it started growing exactly when the bitcoin blockchain hit capacity last January. Surprised there isn't more discussion of this here tbh.

Who are these volunteer contributors? Most of the people coming under fire are on the payroll of other small blockers and don't seem concerned the lack of capacity growth. Others, like Samson Mow, are trolling retards who deserve what they dish out.
Hell, a healthy segment of the community would be grateful if those complaining about being criticized and overworked would devote a whopping 20 minutes to bumping the blocksize, drop all other work, and then go on a two month beach vacation in Thailand. Hell, the community would crowdfund that considering that the second largest blockchain, which these people have been laughing off as irrelevant, is now coming up on 50k transactions daily and is on track to hit 100k within a year.
Early investors and users are livid. But sure, criticism is haram and we should all keep our heads down and faith up.

The top two cryptos are doing around 270,000 daily transactions. If bitcoin had added capacity last year 255,000 of those would probably be on the BTC blockchain and we'd be seeing at least 5k in monthly transaction growth.
Attempts to jack up fees have pushed up prices slightly, but lack of transaction capacity and price competition between blockchains is keeping a lid on it and pushing transactions elsewhere. Miners made a bad mistake.
