I think I have ability, but I dont know how to do it. I have an offline solution (downloaded carbonwallet) to generate a transaction. Year ago all was fine: that thing formed for me correct transaction and after that I was able to broadcast it at  
I can see this strings in my .js file
function(privKey) {
        Electrum.gen(10, function(r) { 
          WALLET.getKeys().push(new Bitcoin.ECKey(r[1])); 
          if(WALLET.getKeys().length == 10)
            login_success(); 
        });
      } 
  function txOnChangeSource() {
    var i = $(' option:selected').prop('index');
    $('
    txDropGetUnspent();
  }
I think there are my private keys inside, and WALLET.getKeys().getExportedPrivateKey() returns it. But I'm not a programmer guy and have no clue how to get my keys from the browser.

This is an old wallet from 2014. Now carbonwallet is the very different thing. I have that opensource wallet back from that time. It is html+js, you can run and form transaction offline and than broadcast. By default they use  to broadcast. I can form my transaction on my computer and than broadcast it thru some broadcasting service. At least it worked year ago. And now it's broken.
blockchain.info told me that "The transaction must have at least one input".
Generally my issue is that I have seed that incompatible with all modern clients. I have a tool for, and also an algorithm how to manage that issue. But that does not work anymore.
