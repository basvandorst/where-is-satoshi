When I decided to cash out I only wanted half so I did it a weird way thats really payed off since. I had let's say 10 bucks and instead of day trading for more Bitcoin I'd buy 10 bucks worth when I thought it was going to go up then sell when it eventually did and buy only ten bucks when I thought it was about to go back up again. Rinse and repeat. Instead of making more btc from each smart trade I made Fiat and kept my holdings always the same even though I bought back less btc each successful trade.

Coinbase is owned by gdax . Com
If you set up a gdax account you can transfer your coins to the new account and day trade for free. Iirc You have to make limit buy and sells for it to be free but if you want to straight trade it costs .25% to buy and free to sell.

Shoot if I were in his shoes I'd give the same answer he did whether I bought back the pizza btc with Fiat immediately or not. No sense in telling the world how much money you have. 
Edit: I'd still buy pizza with btc too! It helps btc gain traction when it's used in real world purchases and doesn't cost any more so long as you dont change how much Bitcoin you own by buying a pizzas worth before pizza purchase. I'd also ad that I know I'm going to eat pizza in the future so it's a good idea to put a hundred bucks into a pizza dedicated btc wallet todat so next years pizzas are cheap af

I plan to sell 40% immediately for even pennies, then after a week sell 25%, then wait a month and decide on the rest. Probably hold 10% for forever just in case.

I once paid a hobo to stand in line at Black Friday for hours then I showed up at 15 min til open and sold my spot for more than I paid the hobo. Win win... Point being the company has "someone's" info and if that person bought something somewhere with CCTV and saved his receipt at the time of the atm theft then win win. This is all hypothetical of course since we can't know the thoughts of the theives but it wouldn't take much forethought to pull it off.

Same. 
I was going to invent Bitcoin and buy 20 dollars worth when they were 10 for a penny. But the drugs wore off and I forgot all about til just now.

Or they put a ton of money into it, come back after they have moved the coin to a safe wallet then steal the machine before someone services it and steal it plus their money back

The pizza guy did say he had a regret, it wasn't buying the pizza but that he didn't take the Fiat he would've spent on the pizza and replace the Bitcoin immediately. Honestly tho I got the impression that he feels anyone can regret not getting in when it was cheap but at least he's got a little claim to fame in Bitcoin history.

Isn't the idea: give your bank 5 paper dollars, buy 5 dollars off btc and buy a sandwich. If every accapted btc and Fiat then doing things this way would leave the banks stuck with the paper currency
