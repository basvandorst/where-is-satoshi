I have this same issue. I cashed out most of mine on Coinbase (they were in there since purchase) to pay off debt and moved the bit I have left to my QT wallet, but with the price now I almost want to put them back to Coinbase or maybe just cash out altogether. Not sure I have the stomach for this and paper wallets seem so... I don't even know the word for it. Ephemeral, I guess. Part of this magic money is that it's sometimes hard to wrap my head around how easy and hard it is, all at the same time. Have trouble trusting myself.
I am just a natural worrier, too! Don't even get me started on the tax issues... ugh.

This is why my earthquake kit has one pack of Marlboro, one pack Camel Light, and a fifth of Jamesons in it... even though I don't smoke anymore.

OK, you decide what's "better" when it comes to people spending their own money. Nice.

Your son has made a smart decision. However, this is a real teaching opportunity. Don't stop with this purchase, because as any investor knows, diversity is key. If the kid is interested in trading, this is a good thing. Those are the types who grow up to make a lot of money, but his first priority should be to diversify. He needs to pursue more traditional investments, and it also wouldn't hurt to go the other way and look at other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is not the only game in town.
As far as converting to fiat, Coinbase has worked ok for me. I trade in other alt currencies on btc-E by moving btc bought at Coinbase to there.
If some personal experience is helpful here, I paid off my student loan debt with bitcoin that I bought awhile ago. It is not a scam, but it is also not foolproof.
There is also nothing dangerous about meeting in person to buy--many sellers are retail merchants who also accept btc and just ask that you purchase from their store when buying your btc. It is usually not a dark alleyway type of scenario.

I just logged in for the first time in quite awhile to respond to this comment: I paid off my student loans (~20K) with BTC. I it took a lot of them and I only have 10 left but I am so relieved to be rid of the debt. It was worth it, suck it Sallie Mae. Just wanted to pipe up here, I guess it's not a "fun" story but it is immensely meaningful to me and a big turning point in my life to not be saddled by this debt.

Some research would have gone a long way there... FOX, man. One of the critiques is that the quality of the sign was too good... seriously?
This clip made me want to buy more bitcoins. If these are the best arguments against it that a supposed business channel can come up with, it's time to go all-in.

Love this thread. I've started asking all my bartenders if they would prefer to be tipped in bitcoin and new one today said yes. So I sent 5 bucks ($20 tab) to his email through Coinbase. 
Got this email from him a bit ago near the low: "that site is jank already lost a buck, but thanks! livin in future now."
I have had a lot of fun tipping cool bartenders this way and he's the first random one to ever write to me. What a day.
That story could be better, but I am shitty at Swype. Prefer real conversations over actual pints most of the time!
