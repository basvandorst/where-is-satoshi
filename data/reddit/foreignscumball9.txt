One project would never monopolize the whole world's identification needs. We will need identification for medical, insurance, automotive, financial, educational, and many other sectors. Some of these projects will grow together, and no, it wont eliminate the need. If anything, it might demonstrate the usefulness and reinforce the need.

Eh, in his eyes he's offering good advice. No need to get mad about it. Family should look out for each other and we that's what he's trying (But perhaps failing) to do. We don't know what Uncle Bob will say next, but if it's along the lines of 'Fair enough, just be careful' then I don't see any harm in what he's saying.

I would add if you plan on trading often coinbase can react quicker. If you have it on a hardware wallet it takes about 30 minutes to an hour to send it back to coinbase before you can do anything with it. So for holding longterm, get a hardware wallet and put it somewhere safe. For learning about the different currencies and selling/buying small amounts often you are probably fine with a  2FA coinbase account

Not sure how i feel about the pond idea. Could see some do-gooder fishing it out and throwing it away.
