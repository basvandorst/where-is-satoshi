BitShares is a great decentralized exchange

Check out BitShares decentralized exchange, it’s still new but there are very high hopes it will be the gold standard for exchanges.

Aren’t you doing the same exact thing though, but just opposite?
By saying “now is not the time” how don’t you know that the whales have YOU right where they want you?
Just some food for thought. Nobody knows what Bitcoin is going to do.

It seems pretty good to me
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:22:59
BitShares is better 
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:47:22
Why would it be crashing half as fast? Most people didn’t even know about bitcoin back then. 
If anything, things will crash twice as fast

Check out BitShares. It’s an actual decentralized exchange.

Yeah but like you said it’s more of the “herd” mentality I think that matters. 
Hopefully the greedy bastards that are running the show have picked up enough coin and will start a bull run soon. 
All I know is I feel like an idiot from the last bull run and got in way too late, so I’m not risking that happening again. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:06:28
So you’re saying it’s going to be a reversal soon then? I was having the same feeling. 
I remember last December and I got sucked into believe that BTC was still going to rise because everyone was saying it was, and that’s when it crashed. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:20:45
Greed mostly. 
People are ravenous for that paper shit. 
I, on the other hand, enjoy making money but also know how to be patient for it.

This post in underrated tbh

BitShares. It’s the best 
@_date: 2018-08-19 15:22:33
Because bitcoin wasn’t as popular in 2014. It was more of a pump and dump and then everything that happened with MtGox messed everything up. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 04:51:48
Couldn’t agree more. Let people tell you you’re wrong. They’re just bitter. It’s called climbing the wall of worry haha
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:32:32
This reminds me of that one spongebob episode

I think you need to move the red line at the end over to the hump before that on the 2014 chart. 
Meaning there will be one more hump to like $8500 or so, then back down to where we are at now, and then moon

Literally perfect dude. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 06:12:37
BitShares DEX
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:21:34
Go to Coinbase.com, verify your identity with a drivers license, add bank account or credit/debit card, and purchase some bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:39:07
Nah man some of the big investors in bitcoin believe it’s going to be worth over $100k maybe even over $1 million someday, right now it’s not even at $10k, you might as well invest a little. Just download Coinbase and buy some
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:14:24
Dude it’s BitShares or nothing!! Check out BitShares at BitShares.org
@_date: 2018-11-06 05:28:16
“Hey man want me to gild your rune armor for you?” 
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:41:24
BitShares is a decentralized exchange, more advanced than bisq. No tor, you can even use it without downloading anything 
@_date: 2018-11-09 05:18:46
Only send money in increments you’re willing and can afford to lose. 
Like the other guy said, use instant buys and ACH. 
There’s been plenty of people who make posts like this where the wire transfer gets “lost” or somehow doesn’t go through, not sure why people keep making the same mistakes.

He’s just another shovel seller. Making money by “teaching” people how to get money. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:26:06
It will probably be some type of digital currency with I believe we are really far still from having a one world government and basically being totally enslaved as a whole.
