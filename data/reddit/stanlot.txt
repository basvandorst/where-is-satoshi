Wow, this is pretty significant
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:29:48
but bitcoins and iphones didn't exist 10 years ago :P
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:06:46
Same here but it seems fine now
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:00:56
Each one, yeah. Though you should probably be looking at bitstamp's price and not mtgox.
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:49:46
@_date: 2014-01-25 06:59:46
It's something!
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:35:16
Only the first $1000 per week is instant though.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:21:03
An increase in price from buying more is normal though. If your buy order is large enough to eat through the current lowest ask price, your average cost per coin will undoubtedly be higher.
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:15:01
Should have bought the BTC when you made the bet :P
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:45:11
If they never followed Bitstamp, they were at the very least closely in tune with Bitstamp prices. The question now is where their current price comes from because they're ~~solid~~ solidly above every major exchange save for Huobi, which has never happened before.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:21:45
Thought this was gonna be about :[
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:09:03
So optimistically, we'd hit 100k well before 9/2016. Eep.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:38:29
That's right, but OP said he got 123,000 uBTC and his picture shows 123 mBTC, which is the same thing.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:42:49
Well. At least they didn't try very hard
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:43:01


My sides
Unfortunately, anyone who hasn't researched into bitcoin doesn't already know that bitcoins can't be replicated in any way will probably believe this.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:35:37
Well if you want to get technical about it, Bitcoin was actually the question...
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:06:22
It's back up.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:57:36
I tried looking at the picture upside-down, thinking it was an ambigram. I hope I wasn't the only one...
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:32:13
If you have at least 100 comment karma and you send a message with "REDEEM KARMA" in the message body, you'll get roughly .50 USD in bitcoins.
For the lazy: 
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:52:47
Not to derail the conversation but, where in the world does it cost $1200 to feed a family of four for a month?? You could probably do that on roughly a third of that budget...
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:08:26
And this same guy was flinging a couple BTC around 7 months ago too. Jeez.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:01:35
That's 123,000 microbtc. One microbtc is 1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin so he got .123btc
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:15:11
Probably made a killing on transaction fees. I'd love to see more crop up in large cities like Boston or NYC
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:27:35
Popular early-Youtube personality.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:43:17
here you go
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:50:50
No, there is a 1% fee as well as a 0.15 bank fee
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:11:08
Cheers, you can now definitively say you made money 
Good luck with the rest of your ventures
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:19:55
I'm watching Bitstamp's chart though. Dem ATHs.
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:18:29
No, a normal purchase takes about 4-5 business days to complete but they also have an instant buy service when you link a credit card which doesn't have a very high limit (0.1 btc/week) until 30 days after your first purchase completes (10 btc/week)
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:26:21
Yeah... that would mean a minimum market cap of 1.2 trillion USD. I wouldn't bet on that happening any time *soon*.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:40:31
But seriously, Destiny is just being abrasive because that's what he does. He's still having a dialogue and learning about it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:13:25
Seems more like one person/group cashing out.
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:25:50
I'm liking coinbase more and more every day
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:31:23
I think they brought it back. It's on the sidebar
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:50:38
Christ. That's way better than finding change in your couch. Congrats!
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:08:21
Holy cow. That's a life changing amount of money right there. If I were you, I'd cash out at least the $1500 you spent on the coins and then hold on to the rest like your life depended on it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:06:19
had a couple recent top posts that compiled some faucets. Head on over and take a look
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:26:44
Most people don't know about this but if you have at least 100 comment karma, you can "redeem karma" once by messaging here:
It's a one time thing and only about $.50 USD but at least you'll feel like you're along for the ride!
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:59:45
But your payout amount for those 25 games were 100x compared to the 2x from earlier games? I don't know how just-dice works but generally, higher payout means lower chance of winning, right? I mean, if you had won even once in 100 games at 100x payout, that would be breaking even but you only played 25 games.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:28:42
To be fair, we're in a time when it's important to see more businesses, big or small, start accepting bitcoin. Not only does this lend it credibility as a viable currency, it's just plain good for everyone involved; businesses will dip their toes into the bitcoin market and bitcoin holders will have more outlets to spend in.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:55:32
Was going to point this out but couldn't really describe it as well as you did. Basically, if you throw x # of BTC out there for sale, you're not going to get market price for all of them. The price will get progressively lower since you temporarily raised the supply far over the demand. You won't get x(current price) and still be able to tank the price.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:58:20
Like today.
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:00:59
But that was when Coinbase stopped all buying temporarily. Those purchases even came with a disclaimer and a box you literally had to check yourself to ensure that you read the text. Whoever complained about those purchases and didn't bother to read the additional text when forking over hundred to thousands of dollars probably deserved it for being so flippant with their money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:56:36
It already did earlier as well. I don't think the sell price ever hit 1000 though.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:48:50
They can't "delete" them, but they can certainly freeze them and just leave them untouched and out of circulation. To be honest, even if they sell them off, the impact on the price would probably be short term and minimal.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:30:44
While it's nice that this is now an option, I'd like for there to be a quick toggle on/off switch or something without having to go into my preferences to do it.
Edit: Especially since the new values change how the log scale looks
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:31:57
$100,000,000 *worth* of bitcoins. Not 100,000,000 bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:25:02
If you set up a recurring $1 payment, won't it charge you the .15 bank fee each time? Seems like it would be far more preferable doing larger amounts over a couple days rather than a buck a day.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:33:49
I saw this yesterday too, what am I looking at?
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:30:15
Ha, not if I only have just one BTC I bought to be along for the ride :[
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:15:03
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:53:49
"you-bit"? It's more of a "mu-bit"
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:30:07
Of course not but people don't really understand the money they use everyday either but that doesn't stop anyone from using it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:29:21


@_date: 2013-11-18 08:57:59
stabilizing at 550?
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:45:58
What's your reasoning for $3000?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:50:52
Well, to reach $1,000,000 USD pre-tax, you'd need at least 1,124 BTC at a rough current value of $890/BTC. So however many people here who have that much, which is probably very *very* few of us.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:30:07
How does something like this even happen??
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:51:53
Coinbase seems to be very much in sync with bitstamp's values. Problem is that you'd have to wait 30 days after your first successful purchase to unlock a significant instant buy limit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:41:26
Yo dawg...
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:33:13
Well, this guy's definitely drunk.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:53:15
Free bitcoin sites. You click around ads every few minutes for a couple microBTC at a time.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:21:40
No, you just can't walk into a bank in China and trade BTC for CNY/RMB.
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:12:31
Yet China is trading at a volume 3-8x greater than the rest of the world at almost any time of day.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:23:05
Most likely? A moderate price drop for a short period of time. It would just get eaten up by buyers eventually.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:30:17
Yeah, but who'd give you BTC for your plasma?
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:25:57
He means that currently, the total BTC market is worth 12B. There's a little over 12 million BTC already mined and with a value of approximately $1000USD/BTC, the total market value is about 12B USD.
21M is just the max number of BTC that will ever be mined.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:02:20
But then you get posts like this and wonder if it's worth it:


so bitcoin is stored on an hDD right?






@_date: 2013-12-03 20:00:55
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:33:55
Self posts don't impact link karma
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:38:50


Probably not then...
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:44:38
200,000 new accounts in the span of less than three weeks? You guys gotta get to hiring more support staff!
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:02:16
Why am I surprised that this exists?
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:34:51
1 mBTC = 1000 uBTC, 123 mBTC = 123,000 uBTC. I don't understand what the confusion is about.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:50:57
I wonder how they determine if someone is "high risk"
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:33:49
Only Gox dropped a considerable amount. Bitstamp still going strong.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:23:05
I can't actually believe this. All I'm doing is watching the charts go higher and higher by the minute. It's just hit 510 right now...
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:15:26
Is 2FA airtight? How secure does it make your account if you have it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:13:15


What's an API key?
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:07:31

Who's upvoting this crap?
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:52:20

Pretty sure they have a service that lets you print a paper wallet for offline storage.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:00:45
I think you're alone on this one. Just because I have BTC and can purchase it doesn't mean I'll buy things I don't need.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:27:28
It certainly will if btc tanks further and you piss away half or more of your uncle's money. And yes, it is your uncle's money. Be thankful someone cares enough to provide for your education.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:31:21
Speaking of changes on coinbase, does anyone else have a weird instant buy amount? I'm supposed to be able to instantly buy 0.32 BTC since the last time I checked but now  it says I can buy $43 worth of BTC instantly, or &lt;0.05BTC. The heck happened?
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:11:25
Selling doesn't automatically drive the price down. People have to be willing to sell at lower prices to actually bring the price down. If their threshold is $1000 and it dips below $1000, then obviously people will stop and the value will stabilize around there.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:06:31
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:01:18
So... is Jackie Chan also endorsing bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:25:50
I'll take some, only if you're using bitcoin to buy!
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:37:27
That... sounds plausible but also pretty terrible considering it's on the cusp of being 1k USD/BTC. An instant buy of .1 BTC/week sounds pretty lame if you're someone who has a recurring buy set up.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:16:39
    wow
                           very sauce           
      much original
                                       so pickle
                       wow
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:59:04
Whoa, thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:26:48
Most people recommend that if you have a significant amount (an amount you can't afford to lose), move most of it to offline cold storage. 2FA is pretty useful though.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:00:10
Congrats on your profit of ~$180k (so far!)
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:26:28
I did instant. I first changed my login details to something simple that I'd never use and then immediately after verification, I changed it all back. I never got anything like you did and they've given me no particular reason to distrust them.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:42:41
Well, that was over pretty fast. Looks like every market bounced back a fair amount already.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:08:38
enjoy the ride
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:24:10
What? No. No no no no no. Stay in school, ffs.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:01:52
I don't know if there actually is anything that tells you that. I don't remember seeing it when I first bought and it was hell waiting almost a full week while watching the price shoot up almost 75% in the meantime.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:58:52
So this means if I decide to buy 1 Bitcoin now  and it rises to $1000/BTC by the 22nd, I will get .6 rather than 1?
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:26:02
No large business operates without a few bumps. Keep in mind that Bitcoin is getting enormous at a tremendous rate and running 100% smoothly is most definitely not what's going to happen at the moment.
Edit: keep in mind that I'm not defending them because I don't know what each individual circumstance is but you shouldn't completely write something off because a few vocal people in a pool of hundreds of thousands had a bad experience.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:16:55
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:38:34
I can't see this dropping too far below 900, if that.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:08:01
Now start spending them!
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:21:25
600 and beyond!
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:19:35
Aaaand right back up to 580 on Bitstamp.
