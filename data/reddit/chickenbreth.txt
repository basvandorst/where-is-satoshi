obviously being trolled/scammed. it took me less than 5 min to get all that same info about you just from your profile and previous posts/google. and the fact that one of your posts outlines how you were previously scammed and has dollar amounts, sort of guarantees the 1btc sum, and the gullibility/scammability (sorry no offense).  when you ask questions or make posts using any information that can make you vulnerable or a target do it from a theo away account, not a named account.  no problem using real names, but in that case don't use any real facts or figures and vise versa...just the state of internet these days.

if he were to attack anything for ca it would be fiat and that just pushes more people to altcoins. trump is like "the big one" as in earthquakes and california always was predicted to fall off the continent when he hit.

Anyone have solid reasons why they would be trustworthy to even share my bank info with?

You bring the phone online to download the app? Or is it possible to install over USB from an offline computer and bring the app to that computer using a thumb drive?  It sounds pretty secure, mostly depending on the precautionary steps you take. Memorizing the seed sounds more like a fun challenge than a necessary step though, I lean on the side of perceiving that as more risky than coming up with an interesting way to save it on paper and building in a sort of treasure hunt for relatives in your will.
