The minimum value is 0.00001, so you either ran into a bug or you've messed around with the defaults.  This isn't how it is for most everyone else.
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:07:06
Then something is wrong with your client, I have never had it decide to pay less than 0.0001.  I think that is the default too, but I may be wrong on that part.
According to the wiki it is the default, something is messed up with your client: 
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:05:52
I think the default is 0.00001 or at least that is what it always is for me and when I am in a hurry, I add a little more, it's not like it's a lot of money...

The only paper bitcoin is the few ETFs and they are fairly new.  Bitcoin is a highly liquid hybrid commodity on its own and if you control the keys, that's as good or better than fiat money.
  


  
The foundation spent their funds, and that is a testament to bitcoins liquidity.

Are you really doing this just to buy a fake id?

Looks like he is unbanned!

Your fee is not the right fee, you're saying core decided on that fee?

Define what you mean by recovery phrase.  If you're talking about a brain wallet, brain wallets are not recommended around here these days.

ROFL!  I'm going to stay safe in my assumption that the very same people who cry about not being able to spam this sub with hard fork clients are the same people who want to get people to run those clients.

This is a relevant submission for a few reasons.  
  
It is presumed that bitcoin was started because of failing financial markets because Satoshi Nakamoto famously embedded the text "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" in the Genesis block of bitcoins blockchain.
  
Bitcoin is presumably affected by the state of markets around the world and China is one of the biggest.

No.  This place is not the appropriate place for this type of discussion because it will instantly turn into promotion and uneducated people are easily manipulated.  Bad actors will exploit it to get people to run a bad implementation in order to cause failure\problems.
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:21:54
I agree with what you're doing here.  It is not this subs job to play a roll in consensus and we have seen time and time again how reddit is used to influence people one way or another.  There are too many uneducated in the underpinnings of bitcoin who are excited and will download and run something if they think it is popular.  I could see this place being used to push a bad implementation in order to overcome the proper consensus that is needed.  When I say proper consensus, I am talking about consensus among those educated in bitcoin development.

He made his first million with bitcoin in 2011.  He donated 1,000 bitcoins to a charity when bitcoin was over $1000 so I'd say he's filthy rich.  
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:59:10
That guy doesn't appear to understand the fundamentals of bitcoin.

Sure they will.  Not a chance in hell I'm going to trust an anonymously registered domain.

Nice try, your comment that was removed had you calling me an immature twat and those types of attacks are not allowed around here.  Real mature of you too!

How do we know for sure that it is secure?
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:14:55
Right.  I've met IT folks who learned about bitcoin because of cryptolocker and are now hodlers.
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:42:54
I should have said he made his first million **from** bitcoin in 2011.
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:56:55
It's like winning the lottery, you're going to get hounded if you are public about it.  A lot of early adopters scrubbed their activity on bitcointalk and reddit after bitcoin took off.
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:47:46
Nobody is stopping you from being educated.  There are places much better suited for that than a sub-reddit that is constantly spammed with misinformation and half truths.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:12:23
Congrats dude, glad you are doing well, don't let the haters get you down!

He was correct in his prediction that if he acquired a lot of bitcoin he would become very wealthy.

His fee was 0.00000192 BTC.  He has since sent another with an appropriate fee and it has already been confirmed.

This topic is a lot like the US Election process.  The person voted into office is not usually the most qualified and best for the job, it is usually whoever had the best campaign and financial backing.  I don't want bitcoin to fall victim to the same thing that is destroying my county.

How is this a problem with network capacity?  Miners don't fill up each block right now, why would they fill up even bigger blocks?
@_date: 2016-01-11 22:30:49
No it is not factually correct.  A prediction wouldn't be led with "maybe".

Read the wiki you linked "minrelaytxfee: 0.00001".
  
Either you messed with it or ran into some bug I have never seen before.
