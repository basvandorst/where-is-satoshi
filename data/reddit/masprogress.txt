Just switched today. Been wanting to dump Coinbase for a while 
@_date: 2018-10-18 23:21:59
It ships next week. Looks pretty cool

Become familiar with gold's role in monetary history. Apply that to the internet era.

This guy is a saint compared to the government’s war on drugs

Guessing Ledger doesn’t support wasabi receive addresses yet, Trezor does. Coinjoin worked great for me btw.

Great post. Fake news MSM will bash whatever threatens the shadow Gov. Bitcoin and Trump got them scared.

Duck duck go

Yes. What does the political/economic establishment  hate? Trump and Bitcoin. What do I support? Trump and Bitcoin.

I've been in crypto about 6 months but that's what I assumed haha. Read the recent tweets from  both have potential unless btc decides to scale. But that doesn't look like it's happening anytime soon sadly

Was a fee estimation issue, now corrected.

I could be wrong but just like silver was money for the masses, another coin (LTC?) will be used for small transactions.

Would you pay for coffee with gold? Didn't think so

The richer these guys get, the more corruptible they become. It's like money is a drug 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:07:42
It more likely means the end of ETHs bubble
@_date: 2017-06-11 05:44:55
I disagree. Nobody would buy coffee with gold. Silver (another crypto) would work better.

 on twitter has a 4 part thread for anyone seeking answers. Bullish, for now.

Noobz will be noobz.

Holy shit. Bought my trezor for $100 couple months back, Amazon pricing them now closer to $300.....
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:15:11
Check the Trezor prices on Amazon now...

They are beginning to panic
