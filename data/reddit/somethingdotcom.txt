That would be my ultimate deal, but 15k sell in 5k
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:56:33
I remember a guy that said it would hit 8k, when it was 13, then it went 15k and I was “ha ha”, but now.....

I put all my money in cryptos instead of drinking all weekend and spending mad money on it, that changed for me!

Few days ago I invited many friends at home and one of them saw my Trezor package on the table, so we started talking about bitcoin and I do not like to talk about it with friends, because most of them are ignorant I have to argue with them just to explain how it works atc...so most of my friends that play video games all weekend and spend all their money on computer parts and snowboard trips "knew" it is a bubble with doing no research whatsoever.

Invest $25 in bitcoin, now have $32....I dont know how you guys live that 9 to 5 nonsense of a life! :D

So their bank account was blocked from the biggest private bank in the country, because of the big volume of money from unknown sources - all bitcoin transactions in and out. I dont believe it is related with the massive amount that the government probably owns.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:29:04
Probably face to face or not on a trading platform with no banks involved - just cash for transfer from your side....but dude pay your taxes and dont be worried!

Best way to hodl - hardware wallet at your mamas house :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:52:57
In Japan it is already mainstream! In the last video I watched there were tens of thousands of locations аccept bitcoin!

Man not hot!
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:10:03
Oooh men, not again, I am sick of those crashes, I should stop investing in this bubble!
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:02:10
I am wainting for Boobcoin.....I think I will invest in boobcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:22:57
I believe that is the situation - I already sold half of my ripple and bought BTC, and have waiting order for higher price if there is another jump from them...Only few really strange coins are green today, so something is happening
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:49:45
No no, I did that in the past and know it is pointless...but now witnessing the whole mess live I saw how fast can it go down and you can not be always watching the markets, so I place and order for some pretty low price compared around 8k.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:15:32
You should be new here!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:58:54
How many times do we need to you teach you that old man.....do not buy with money you dont have
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:08
Everyone was begging for a dip....here is your dip now...what for it fall a little long and buy!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:41:26
I had some money in BAT (I like there idea cause it is kind of bald...or stupid - they try to eliminate google from the ad biz) and the IOTA I believe have some good background.

Next stop is to can afford new Pedomobile :D

I am waiting for MCFee now! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:31:58
I expect the BCH comment soon!
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:14:01
Yeah, also no one in the news mention how many actual donations for good causes are done via bitcoin. They only love to talk about the dark web!
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:53:26
Sooo many people are exited about the 10k - on cex.io is it 10 100 for stable 5 hours. I hope for bigger dip, but around 9k probably I will buy. It is going to be an interesting week!
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:37:33
Totally my interpretation, but i believe it will stay around 10k for awhile. It took 1 day for the price to go from 8400 to 9800 and then almost 2 days it is going around 10k. When it finally hits many people will start selling, so probably it will go down a little, then will just above 10k etc....10k is a mental barrier for many people.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:54:54
I believe would be some kind of crash at some point, but then as in the dotcom bubble only the best will stay and will become greater than ever... for now there are too many pointess coins
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:05:24
Saving indeed, but their biggest problem is the aging generation, but two thing are more or less related :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:38:38
Nice try, ex-wife!
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:32:02
The fall for 10 min was caused by some bug cash outs that made all panic, so probsbly it could happen again, place waiting order at low price and wait!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:39:09
It is interesting how much electricity does Las Vegas consume?
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:49:29
Probably a good idea to buy before it...but it is so high right now!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:36:07
Nice try, tax person!
