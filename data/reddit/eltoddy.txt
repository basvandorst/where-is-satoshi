Not really. this transaction's fee was 4 sat/byte and it took 15 hours to confirm. You can move BCC with 1 sat/B fee and confirmation in the next block.

Feel free to prove me wrong, I will gladly admit I'm wrong if that's the case.

Even if true it doesn't change the facts.

I'm pretty sure most people just ignore things they don't like.

Yes, 4 hours. Not saying is perfect, but the transaction OP is showing took 15h. At 4 sat/b your BCC **will** be in the next block. This is a fact, you can test all you want.

You are the one bringing BCC, I was just pointing out that OP was hiding the fact that his low fee transaction took 15 hours to confirm.
Maybe you just have a hate-boner for Bitcoin Cash?

[Why did you cut the time it was included in a block?](
It took 15 hours! Kind of embarassing.

I thought we were talking about BTC and fees. Not sure how BCC trade matters in this case.

Yes, I am an **evil big blocker**. Doesn't change the fact I didn't brought up BCC.
Sorry if posting in offends your religion or something.

There are plenty of coins with lower fees. Your point?
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:03:54
Fair enough, I guess. OP is still lying by omission, bragging about low fees when it took 15 hours to get a confirmations is kind of ridiculous.
