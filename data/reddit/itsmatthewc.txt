I'd try [purse.io](  Purse lets a **buyer** (you) to make a purchase on amazon with a credit card/other payment method for a **seller** (person providing the bitcoin).  The process is made simple as well, typically going like such:
* Make an account on Purse.io.
* Press Buy BTC and choose a orders with your preferred price set by a seller.
* Fill out the order on amazon and provide the order id for your transaction on Purse.io.
* Wait for the order to be delivered to the seller, then receive your bitcoin!
This service works well since you're able to choose your price through the available options.  I've been using Purse to obtain and spend most of my bitcoins since I find it very simple and safe. **Please know** that most of the orders set by the sellers are at a higher price than the current bitcoin price, so it depends on how much you're willing to spend.
If you're interested, I think that [their video]( helps explain their service very well.

Purse isn't a wallet, only a marketplace

Well, considering bitcoin is an online currency... I'd hope that there would be more bitcoin subscribers.

I really like it.  If the title could update as well as the page, that would be great (so price can be seen while switching tabs).

From what I've seen of coingig, it's definitely a bit sketchy (haven't purchased so wouldn't know for sure).  Some of the items honestly shouldn't be offered (e.g. re-vines, email accounts, $5 amazon giftcard for the cost of $5), so if something could be properly built and moderated, then it'd be a much better system. :)
