The precautions set in place for bitcoin can just as easily be applied to credit cards. All you're doing is making a new credit card, big whoop. At least with a credit card, it might be a fraudulent order here or there that gets paid back, and not the emptying of one's life savings.
Your dismissal of the need for insurance just highlights the kind of recklessness I see so often with bitcoin advocates.
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:31:22
The number 1 failing of bitcoin advocates is their inability to perceive the difficulties and risks facing a regular person using bitcoins.
The security challenges and technical know-how needed to use bitcoins in a safe, reliable, and convenient way are quite frankly astronomical with respect to the abilities of the average joe. People still don't know how to change their car oil or windshield wiper fluid.
Once bitcoin can be made safe, reliable, and convenient for the masses, then it'll have transformed into something indistinguishable from traditional forms.

I'm not saying nothing should ride the coat-tails of Bitcoin. I'm responding to a specific topic about why the sub may seem more hostile... It's because it needed to be with all the critiques and hostility towards the first widely used cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:56:22
Insurance for cryptocurrency? No one is going to insure large cryptocurrency companies, themselves currently being the primary source of theft.
Further, it's nearly impossible to know whether or not a client is defrauding the insurance company by falsely making a claim. At least in the real world, there is physical evidence when someone makes a large withdrawal, or burns down their house. There's a paper trail to identifiable accounts whenever a transaction takes place too, because so many measures have been put in place to make sure account owners are real.
The only way personal insurance could work with cryptocurrencies is if it's heavily regulated. The currency can only be spent, stored, and collected from heavily regulated entities. At the very least, it will involve users having real-life identifiable accounts with every entity they do business with.
In the end, these regulated locations still have the freedom to anonymously "lose" their clients' assets in any manner of ways.
If these regulated entities had the fort knox of security protocols, continuously updated, that made it so even the owners couldn't steal client assets, then we've still created a new problem. With all the regulation and security measures required to make cryptocurrencies usable, safe, and reliable for the common person, it will have become practically indistinguishable from using paypal or credit cards on the internet.
Regulated entities would refuse to interact with any money from outside the regulated market otherwise theft and fraud within their own market will be rewarded as there is little risk of being discovered as falsely making an insurance claim, etc... That black market is bitcoin's current atmosphere, and it will never be reliable or safe for the common person.

I'm in the same boat, except I actually did make a fair bit of money before I sold.
The problem with bitcoin, I find, is that to get the application of bitcoin to the point that the average person can use it easily and **safely**, then you essentially end up with a product no different than traditional forms of money and credit.
Even those who say bitcoin is already or can be made more secure than the status quo, fail to realize that credit card companies and banks are balancing convenience with security. If society ever decided it wanted QT security or some other intense regulation to access and manage their accounts, then big bank will tilt the scales towards more security.
Virtually the only thing bitcoin provides for the average person, that traditional forms of money is not likely ever to accomplish, is the lack of inflation, which will only come a lifetime away from now. Governments and banks around the world rely on inflation to balance the budget and manage the economy, I do not think they will so easily step aside.
Regardless of all of these issues that make widespread adoption of bitcoins an impossibility among the general public, there is still a market for bitcoins in the illicit market, and for use among those living within unstable economies. In other words, bitcoin is pretty much a gimmick for &gt;99% of the population of all developed countries. Westerners who have bought in are merely providing a service, at great risk, for those participating in illicit trades and those residing within hyperinflationary economies.
What is the size of those niche markets? Hard to say. How impervious is using bitcoin against any potential government ban enforced by monitoring internet activity and/or clamping down on merchants? Again, hard to say.
I feel far more confident trading in the stock market then I know of the answer to either of those questions.

@_date: 2014-09-03 16:25:20
Niche uses for those among the &lt;&lt;0.1% of the population with the technical know-how to safely use it? Certainly, niche by definition pretty much guarantees the success of bitcoins.
Global use for the everyday needs of the average person? 0%.

In the defense of and I'm far from a fervent believer, bitcoin has had quite an uphill battle in terms of defending its legitimacy and prospects. That defensive attitude lingers from years of battling. 
Dogecoin is just riding on the coat-tails of bitcoin's success and people want to get in on the ground floor of some random currency, despite the fact that bitcoin is going to be the apex crypto currency given the amount of investment and publicity it has garnered over these years.

It is a problem with Bitcoin. You simply cannot expect people to know how to do this. It would be like expecting everyone to know how to change and maintain everything about their car, but harder.
Further, there are few, and surely none that you mentioned, things that can be stolen from your computer in an automated way with irreversible consequences. A keylogger that takes down your credit card information and empties the contents? Just keep an eye on the history when you pay off your bills and you will get refunded. A stolen ID damaging your credit score? Reversible. Trade secrets are not easily stolen in automated fashion... That would be a targeted attack most likely, and either such information are already (attempted) heavily secured or cannot be used without revealing the perpetrator anyways.
Don't dismiss this weakness of Bitcoins. It has to be addressed. Anyone who thinks this won't remain a problem that prevents wide-spread everyday adoption of BTC has clearly never worked in IT support. Already people with the computer literacy to actually set up and use BTC are getting compromised.... Imagine the YAHOO.COM homepage masses.
I get what your point is, computers could be made more secure... But BTC cannot wait for it.
edit: The increase in security needs to be on the order of what was done for Battle.net. People can't keep their accounts secure, but a phone authenticator makes it very hard to break.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:03:32
I don't see a -60% haircut being represented at that pointer. It's a bubble, and those who bought over $30-40 are playing a dangerous game. I respect BTC and its goals, and I think it can succeed in its aspirations, but this recent appreciation is absolutely diverged from fundamentals and technicals. Sure this bubble may go on and on until $1000, $10000, etc... but inevitably it needs to correct for it to be adopted as a currency. Only when it corrects will it finally be at a range where BTC value is stable, and only when it's stable can it be used as currency.
When the range at which BTC is stable is so far below the current value, massive inadequate reversals will happen time and time again. If you want to play the speculative trader and try to make it big, you risk finally getting caught in the correction that finally brings sanity to the value of each BTC. Don't think you're too quick to get caught, today should be a lesson to everyone on how quickly and easily it can happen.
This nonsense would not happen if it were not a bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:12:40
I'm curious, I've avoided coinbase. When you're locked in, does that mean you actually have the BTC in hand?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:12:59
The talk in that article will be the justifications used to criminalize BTC, or hamstring it's adoption, when the real reasons are far simpler... Governments like having control over money. Interpret "control" however way you want, but they simply aren't going to give up that power. For instance, it has been tremendously profitable for the States to have oil traded in USD. Secondly, banks do not want to lose the business of holding people's money.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:46:59
You know there is nothing to stop Bitcoins from going to 0 in a matter of minutes? This is what separates Bitcoins from the rest of the market.
I commend anyone who at least sold their original investment and riding the rest to the moon. But, when there is finally a correction, just as many people are going to wipe out their savings, as those who made out with a fortune.
For instance, $30 to $2 simply doesn't happen unless a company files for bankruptcy out of nowhere due to criminal actions covering up the shitty situation. Such a drop is absolute madness... So, sure, a correction in the future of the same magnitude may not spell the end of Bitcoins, but such fluctuations will assure that Bitcoins are not adopted in the same way currencies are. To drop from $230 to $15, then rise to $1000, rinse repeat, is simply an unsustainable model.
Given the daily volume vs total number of bitcoins out there, very few people are actually making money wrt to the number of different holdings. With such low liquidity, the stock is very susceptible to bear raids, which could spiral out of control. If you think you can sell at a good price when **the** correction occurs, you're wrong. As someone who trades in low-liquidity small-cap bio, I know how quickly shit can fall... But at least those companies have book value, that is treated with more respect than speculative value.
If I could see some healthy chart action on the bitcoin market, I wouldn't be so wary, but there are simply no support levels anywhere close to $230.... Please, if you're in the market, cash out your principal. I know some people have their life savings in it, cash that out, you've already doubled, etc... ride that amount out if you have to.
Given that a major correction would have a dead cat bounce, you may be able to protect your position if you have 75% of your position in cash, and you buy on the bounce, covering your losses.
**EDIT: Hope you guys listened**

That's the biggest problem with Bitcoin. It threatens the establishment. That's great and all, but it's also a sure way to get the government to clamp down on Bitcoin.
Bitcoin doesn't work if the network is blocked. It can't become mainstream if no vendors are allowed to use it. They can still keep track of those who transfer money to bitcoin markets, etc...
Long story short, the government can make it really hard for most people to use bitcoin.

Isn't giving your money to centralized institutions an antithesis to bitcoins? Cypress version.BTC can happen in such a scenario.
Centralized bitcoin banking eliminates the anonymity of clients, allows for asset seizure, sets BTC back in terms of efficient and speedy transfer of funds to be no more indistinguishable from traditional forms, potential for the exclusion of newly issued BTCs into the banking network, etc... It's starting to become indistinguishable from any other currency.
Insuring bitcoins is the biggest joke of all. Go on your wallet/banking account/etc..., transfer bitcoins to anonymous wallet, and get insurance pay out! It's far too easy to do this scam with bitcoins. It cannot be insured.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:50:11
That's only going to be the norm as long as centralized wallets remain uninsured. Insurance will require a very dramatic increase in regulation and restrictions around the use of bitcoins. 
Until then, there is really no incentive for businesses to be honest once they have what they feel is a sufficient number of bitcoins in their possession. Nothing prevents them from stealing, literally nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:28:23
Just make a new wallet, transfer them to new account, and tell them you were hacked. Nothing they can do.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:38:38
They can claim they are a bitcoin store, but they are actively trading on the market with their client funds.
Bottom-line is, coinbase shouldn't accept USD, or it should have a USD balance.
But if they didn't accept USD, they're would be no opportunity to make huge profits off their clients... Where's the fun in that?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:31:06
We're in uncharted territory. But until there is stability, it won't be used as a currency as you suggest. Now the big question is, is stability far higher or far lower than the current price?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:03:13
That's the problem, we don't have that much control over them. Saying they work for us is quite disingenuous. They work for money and power, and who has more of that than anyone else? Those who already have both.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:34:41
I'm transferring $100 to an account right now, so I can sell for $10k in the next bubble. This shit is going to happen time and time again until the exchanges are more mature and there is a lot more liquidity.
I think a stable region will be $20-30, and so I'll be waiting for that to hit before I buy. I have faith in BTC that the stable price level will increase over time, but, and it's happened at least twice before, there will be opportunities to sell if a bubble forms at vastly inflated values in the future... and then you increase your position when that bubble crashes. Rinse repeat? Let's find out over the next couple years.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:37
I'd love to know how many people managed to buy a sizable number of BTC this week at &lt;$300. From the sounds of it, the guy is taking big transfers, making a risk-free bet on the market,  and pocketing the profit while he returns the original transfer (due to it being "flagged"). Probably made $100k this week at least.
The same game could be played for withdrawals.

@_date: 2013-04-11 12:10:29
This is why fee should be flat rate, not percentages. Percentages stinks of a racket by the exchanges, huge incentive for them to drive price up when they should be a neutral party.
A flat rate can really hit the HFTers hard. $0.001 or $0.0001 would do it.
If mtgox could actually handle the volume, I wouldn't mind their current charging practice, but if they are getting owned by HFT orders, then perhaps it's time to adopt flat rate until they can handle it.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:36:15
People are hoping that stability will come because volume dries up, but that is actually a symptom of the problem that will permit bubbles to form and pop.
It takes very little USD to cause BTC price to crash because the volume is so low during times of stability. You want BTC to be stable? Then you should be encouraging faster/reliable exchanges, and more liquidity and volume. This generally involves MM, or a lot more traders. Both of those require the BTC market, currently in the billions, to be worth a lot more so that profits can actually be made on tighter spreads. It may just be the case that we endure these wild fluctuations until it becomes economical for MMs/traders to move in and provide the liquidity needed to prevent such busts.
This wanting of the market slowing down is bad for BTC's stability, because it becomes too easy to manipulate, cause crashes, and harms it's goals for a currency.

I get how insurance can be worked out, with heavy regulation and restrictions... I get it.
But with all that said and done, how is that distinguishable from current forms of currency other than the fact that it's deflationary? The appeal of bitcoin right now is that it's easy, fast, and anonymous. None of that is the case once the insurance providers gets involved.

I meant in the context of insurance. If you can access your registered account, transfer the funds to an anonymous account, and claim that your funds were stolen, you'd double your portfolio. There would be no way to determine that it was a scam.
Regardless, coinbase routinely picks and chooses who can convert their USD into BTC. For instance, when you transfer $1000 USD to coinbase to be converted into whatever the going-rate is for BTC, coinbase will automatically buy $1000 USD worth of BTC. If over the course of the next few days or weeks the value of BTC goes up, coinbase will cancel your order and refund just your $1000, thus bagging the profit for themselves. If the value of BTC goes down, they will give you the BTC.
You trust them with your bitcoins?

That is a good point, but greedy traders can ruin it for consumers who panic when someone pounds the bid til it breaks through support levels, and collect from the panic sellers. If one has the capital to double their portfolio at a 50% discount, it will happen. As long as the market is available and trading, it can and will impact consumers... And as long as stability breaks down with higher volume, the confidence consumers have in using BTC for consumption will be damaged time and time again. Since you need the market to bring more capital into the BTC market, this relationship is inevitable.
