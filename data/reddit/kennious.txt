Whatever gets ya off, bub. I haven't traded BTC (bought like 500 bux worth a few years ago prior to Mt. Gox bullshit), so I'm admittedly not tuned into normal volumes. However, even the volumes in that order book are, like, a few hundred.
If that's normal volume, it could easily just be the nearly 200k subscribers in this sub circlejerking the price up to $900.

Wow such volume! It looks like nearly dozens of BTC were traded!

Sorry if you misunderstood--I wasn't comparing the volumes of Mt. Gox to today's markets. Really just pointing out the tiny amount of volume in these markets, so I don't place too much stock into the current exchange rates.
If the absolute best day on Bitstamp is 12,000 BTC @ 900 USD, that's 10.8m USD... or to put it another way: about $55 per subscriber in this sub.
I realize that not everyone in this sub trades BTC on a daily basis, but that's really my point: the market is so incredibly tiny that the current valuation means almost nothing. All it would take is a small move (i.e. ~$10m) from one bank to completely disrupt the current price levels. (I would argue that this would be a good thing for Bitcoin, but we're talking about the price levels, not overall health/state of Bitcoin.)
This is also an "unfair" comparison, but I'll offer it for additional perspective: the average daily volume of the EUR/USD market is somewhere in the ballpark of 575 billion USD. If you trade equities/securities, this is like comparing a small-cap biotech penny stock to a Fortune 100 company.

Good timing!
