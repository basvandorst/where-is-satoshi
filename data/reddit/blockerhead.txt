That's exactly what I want to avoid! Every transaction is exchanged between two offline devices, say via Bluetooth, NFC, etc.


   
Since the transaction is received on my device (via NFC, say), that opportunity shouldn't exist; your wallet should deny it. I wanted to know, if wallets resistant to such (and other) tampers exist.

Yes! That is what I wanted to know. Any hints on how to attempt this?

Just one quick question. If the transactions from the offline wallets come in days after, how can one differentiate between the *transaction timestamp* and *blockchain confirmation timestamp*?

Yes; I understood. Thanks!

Yes, I do. :) But, there is another angle to this I am working on.

Well, ideally, when I do go online, my transaction should invalidate the 'getting back 100BTC' transaction because mine occurred earlier. 
I see your point.

I am sorry; can you please elaborate?

The wallet balances should also get automatically updated. For example, a debit/credit message between wallets via NFC technology can update the wallet balances after a transaction. This transaction can be posted to the network when either/both of them come online. 
I am keen to know, if a solution exists that wouldn't tamper the transactions on the wallet and yet implement the right debits/credits given the original balance was sourced from the blockchain.

Got it. Thanks!

Well, shouldn't it? Even outside of scope of this discussion, there might be cases of finite delay between the time transaction that happened in the real world and the time a miner included it in his block. I would expect *some* parties to be interested in the fact as to when the transaction happened and when it was processed.
Something like, the date on a bank cheque vs. the date the cheque was presented to the clerk at the bank branch.
