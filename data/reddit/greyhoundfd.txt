Unfortunately, people often don’t think about the resources required to maintain those accounts. If banking was easy, anyone could be a banker, but most people aren’t. It’s hard, it’s expensive, and it requires building trust with your customer base. Most banks actually aren’t doing too well right now, the financial crisis depleted a lot of that trust and trust isn’t a very renewable resource. 
You’re right it’s not the best solution, but if it’s that terrible their customer base will deplete and they’ll have to change their tune. Like another user said, go for a credit union. They often are more amenable because they have fewer customers to deal, and are much more timid about their policies.

Socialism isn’t about plugging a leak. Socialism posits that the foundation is rotted through, the walls are caving in, and the insulation is leaking some gas that is probably toxic.
I really don’t think you get my point because you’re getting caught up in the wording around that point. The fact that I have stated multiple times what my point was and you keep defaulting back to one fucking sentence that is no longer even that relevant is starting to get annoying. Do you actually disagree that people who advocate socialism only do so because they think it will make them materially wealthy, or are you just being an ass?

Deflation doesn’t cause economic catastrophes, it decreases demand by increasing the benefits of not spending money, which can lead to economic catastrophes when supply is barely being exceeded by demand already. Currencies throughout history have inflated and deflated with the course of world events, there has not been an economic collapse every time the % change had a +.

If bitcoin reaches it’s max value that means it’s achieved theoretical max adoption which means cashing out would effectively crash the global economy, because most infrastructure would be bitcoin-reliant.

I’m fairly certain Electrum lets you set your own fees so it should be possible there.
You are right though, more decimals will be needed at some point. Economic growth basically demands it. If you deflate bitcoin to the Real World values, so that it approximated the whole global economy, a Satoshi would be (I’m pretty sure, I’m not doing the math on this rn) about three cents. That’s, you know, fine, but economies expand. As that happens, the value of a Satoshi goes up, and quickly things start looking like the 1950s where you’re buying a candy bar for a quarter. The problem with that is that it has to be tempered by inflation with fiat currencies, but that’s not an option for us. The only possible solution is adding decimals so people don’t have to default to 1 sat for everything that should be worth .2 sat or whatever.
I’m pretty sure people are working on this though, so it shouldn’t end up being a huge issue.

Peasant 2: Yeah, they've got fixed values supposedly, and they're universal so you can use them to buy a blanket from the weaver AND milk from the herdsman
Peasant 1: Well yeah, but the barter economy is clearly superior. Why use iron to make coins for an exchange when I could just keep it and have MORE iron to barter with?
Yes, everyone knows the transaction fees are annoying, but this technology is still developing and the problems will be fixed by solutions that are literally just around the corner. Just be patient, stop expecting the tech of the 2040s today. Transactions cost money. We can bring the cost down but if you want a free method of transferring money for purchases that also is secure, private, instant, global, and has a fixed supply, you need to be patient. Wait for the solutions to be fleshed out and it will be as good as people say it will be, probably even better.

Banks are evil because a completely separate unrelated entity does bad things?
“If you don’t like it then leave” is a perfectly rational argument because it gets to the root of what’s wrong with your beliefs, which is that you want to have your cake and eat it too. You want income equality but you don’t want to be poor. You hate warfare but you don’t want to get rid of governments. You want people to be incentivized for doing work but you don’t want them to be incentivized for also doing *better* work. If you really cared about socialism, if it was really the be-all end-all of your beliefs, you would go someplace that was socialist. But you don’t really like socialism, what you really like is wealth. The fact that you don’t have wealth but others do is frustrating, but you’re still too childish to acknowledge that *your* problems are *your* fault, so instead you blame others. Why am I poor but others aren’t? It couldn’t be because I made bad financial decisions or chose the wrong career. No, it’s because the rich are all just manipulative and evil! 
Communists and socialists are like children in what they believe. They refuse to acknowledge that their problems are their fault because they’re convinced that having problems makes them defective. The fact is though that most people make financial mistakes, most people aren’t rich, and most people also come to terms with their decisions and say “Yeah, I’m not going to be rich, but I did stuff that makes my life meaningful in ways that are *more* valuable to me than money”. Most people make mistakes in their lives, and instead of wallowing in misery and lashing out at the Rich or at Jews or at (insert ethnic slur here), they say “Well, guess I fucked up. How can I move past this?”. Communists and socialists are communists and socialists because they never get to that phase. They get stuck at wallowing in misery and lashing out.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:51:02
I’m sorry, I was under the impression communism was a system where you told people “No, you can’t do that, it hurts everyone else”. In fact, I’m pretty sure the reason people support capitalism is because capitalism is the only system that leaves value-choices up to the individual directly subject to them, rather than, say, telling you that you can’t be an artist because it wouldn’t benefit society enough.
The fact that capitalism says “You can be an artist but you’re going to make 40k per year max unless people really love you”isn’t a sign that it bans people from having control over their own workplace and life. It’s a sign that it privatizes the costs of your own actions onto yourself and makes you solely responsible for your life, rather than socializing the costs of your choices so that Jennifer in Seattle is paying $50 a month against her will so Ted in New York can turn his graffiti from a thing he does after his real job into a full career.
“Democratic” is a nice buzzword, but what it really means isn’t that you get more choice, it’s that you get less choice, because the things you want to do stop being possible if 51% of the people think they shouldn’t be. That’s what democracy actually is. It isn’t everyone getting to do whatever, it’s tyranny by majority. Sure, maybe Ted is sad that he can’t do art full-time, but it’s just as likely that a socialist state would say “No art, we’re upping your work hours from 8 to 12 hours and cutting your pay by 5% because that’s the only way to make this profitable for the state”. In fact, that is very likely because communist systems are inherently inefficient and have to rely on heavy-handed labor policy to produce even half as much as they could in capitalist economic frames.
Socialism sounds good on paper because the vast majority of its marketing in the West comes from officials trained by KGB and Stasi to be good at fomenting revolutions, and their track record is extremely successful. The track record of the countries they worked with though is not. Venezuela is collapsing, Cuba is rapidly approaching that point, communist dictatorships throughout Africa have either imploded or switched to capitalist systems decades ago. You think socialism encourages democracy *because the information created to spread socialism in the US specifically targeted American memetic images like democracy and liberty*. In Germany and Eastern Europe, it targeted patriotism and peace. In Western Europe, it focused on stability and economic prosperity. In China and Japan, it focused on military strength and unity.

They have little understanding of reality.

Just knowing that they exist makes me feel physical discomfort in my chest, like I’ve actually been injured. I could write for hours, days even on all the ways they are wrong.

You can’t claim to represent Bitcoin and then direct people to an altcoin, it’s unacceptable. It’s like someone founding a Microsoft twitter account that directs people to “mycrosoft.com” and selling them “BC” computers, and when taken to court for this they say “Well the Microsoft slogan is ‘Be what’s next’ so we figured people would want to get on the train for our new product to unseat Microsoft”.
In literally any other context this would be considered a copyright violation and fraud. The fact that legally it can’t be prosecuted as such doesn’t mean it’s right, it doesn’t mean it should be endorsed, and it doesn’t mean Twitter should support it on its platform.

Clearly you do not understand segwit. Even having a segwit address reduces the total fee you pay because your transaction size decreases from 1/2 to 1/4 of what it was originally. When everyone has segwit though, the fees drop even more because the overall size of the mempool drops, which, by basic laws of supply and demand, means that sat/B fees drop as well because their is less competition for mempool space.

Fees aren’t bad tech, nor are lack of fees good tech. Fees are a reflection of the supply relative to the demand, and fees will always be high when the demand for transactions approaches or exceeds the supply of transaction space. Other coins have cheap fees because their demand is low, BTC has expensive fees because its demand is high relative to its transaction space. Stop talking about fees and start talking about tech and supply. Does any other coin have the tech to handle the transaction volume of Bitcoin while offering the same desirable attributes of bitcoin, like security and decentralization? The answer is definitively no. BTC is barely handling that traffic, yes. Everyone knows this, but if you saddled our transaction volume on fucking Monero it would crash overnight.

As for blockstream not being criticized here, it is criticized here. There are a number of different posts which have criticized their approaches, I’ve seen them.

No, they don’t. What they have is transaction demand that is literally so low it’s practically nonexistent. BCash runs 8mb blocks that are still starting to fill because they don’t even implement batching. Bitcoin is trying to run an efficient machine, while every other currency is using transaction space like America used oil in the 50s, while complaining that we’re technologically behind. Well, guess what? The other side of the surplus is the deficit, and the rate at which crypto demand is going other coins are going to run into problems fast, and like the frog in the pot of water things are going to be a-okay up until the moment when they’re not.
The community is resistant to change because it’s democratic. That was the whole damn point of this experiment. And you know what? The community has been pretty damn responsible with that power. They know that the easy solutions lead to decadence in managing resources, so they’ve been responsible in choosing what to do. Raising block space can wait until *after* we know that the system is running efficiently, it doesn’t come before. This is like oil, when oil prices are high everyone wants EVs, and when they’re low everyone wants oil. If you want a sustainable, efficient economic system that can run itself until the sun burns out, you need to pressure people to find solutions by using high prices.

This isn’t bringing BTC to its knees. The fact that fees are high indicates that the system is working as intended, because if fees were low despite very high transaction levels either miners wouldn’t confirm anything or they would confirm transactions despite losing money, which is economically unhealthy.
Never forget that cheapness *and* expense are both parts of a healthy market system. Market systems only fail when prices don’t account for the actual scarcity of a good. Some good being expensive doesn’t indicate that the system has failed, but that it has too many participants, something which we will soon be able to fix by improving infrastructure.

I disagree. While the dot com bubble is referenced all the time, it gives the wrong connotation. Yes, the bubble burst, but the most valuable companies with the best products remained. Amazon, google, apple, Microsoft, all these companies lost millions of not billions in potential and actual market cap from the dot com bubble, but they re-emerged stronger than ever, if not pillars of the modern day economy. Bubbles that happen on one good or one company, like the tulip or Enron, just collapse and they don’t come back. Bubbles that occur across an entire market weed out weak players with inferior offerings and leave an open field for the survivors to grow and develop in. Market bubbles aren’t bad, and they aren’t misconceptions. They happen, and they’re necessary to strengthen markets by eliminating competitors who otherwise might hang on as zombie companies, siphoning market cap from those with real value but less publicity.
Bitcoin with LN is nearly indestructible. I don’t say that in the sense of the titanic, I mean it has innovated so effectively that it dramatically counters the arguments that it’s weak. A crypto bubble is *good*. It will hurt in the short term, but in the long term it means that small time cryptos like Dogecoin aren’t going to be draining market cap from the coins that actually have a valuable market offering and effective technology backing them. I am honestly thrilled about the prospect of a bubble. Why? Because I’ve made a decent amount from crypto, enough that I feel confident in its viability as a product. A strong and vicious bubble can show us just which crypto currencies are the real deal. I’d like it to be BTC because I think BTC has the best tech to facilitate a new global economy, but if it’s Ethereum it’s not like I’m going to off myself over it.
I want to see which of these contenders is the new Amazon or the new Google, I think we all do. We *need* the bubble to burst to see that happen.

Depends on the fee. There’s no guarantee of confirmation, and if your fee is too low the amount will never confirm, or it will take months until the mempool drains. If they set the fee manually themselves, then it should be a few more days.

Keep in mind though that BTC will more likely than not have a higher market cap than gold. Why? Because gold is a speculative store of value but is essentially impossible to use as a currency. You almost always have to sell your gold in exchange for currency to buy something. Even if someone is willing to take your gold, you have to physically be present with them to exchange the gold. 
BTC allows remote exchanges, which will support the market needed for people to use BTC as a currency without exchanging it for accepted tender first.

While it's nothing new, I think it's good to consider since people often compare BTCs valuation to gold (Market cap 7 Trillion). In reality, BTC is much more useful than gold since it has all the advantages of gold but is also liquid and relatively simple to convert into usable currency.

We've been overdue for a price correction for a while now. The risk is that it comes after the futures open. A massive price correction immediately or soon after the futures get offered could set a trend of shorting Bitcoin as being a reasonable bet, especially since many in Wall Street are still convinced that this is just a bubble waiting to burst. On the other hand, a price correction followed by continuous upward growth would be a great thing for us, since shorters would sweat pretty quickly and those who expect Bitcoin to do will would become more prominent in investment communities.

Insider trading does harm bitcoin, because it encourages the forking that Ver has done. If you’re an exchange as big as Coinbase, you know all you have to do to send the price of a coin through the roof is add it to your exchange. It’s instant publicity. No, insider trading does not harm the block chain or transaction protocols, but it harms the confidence and trust that members of the community have for one another. All the people at CB have to do is schedule a coin to be moved onto the exchange, but it up, and voila, instant money. Never mind if the coin is a scam that doesn’t work and siphons market cap from BTC, “insider trading is none of our concern and does not harm Bitcoin in any way at all”.
This is why the SEC exists. The protections it offers seem minor because we aren’t alive for the times when this shit happened.

@_date: 2017-12-14 17:17:25
I think a 2mb increase is in our long-term interests. I don't like the mindset of BCH (Let's just keep increasing block size into oblivion, this definitely isn't an issue), but the fact is that I'm now basically obligated to keep my money in places like Coinbase because what was a small fee at $100 in balance is now looking very large at $224 in balance. I have the paper wallets, but I can't store anything because I'm literally looking at upwards of $15 just to move my transactions.
The worst part is that the influx of wealth into the community is going to continue to drive transaction prices up. As speculators join, they're going to want to ensure they can move money out rapidly for daytime trading, so their transactions fees are going to look relatively big to guarantee movement. This will continue to drive the prices up, so we will see higher than anticipated increase in transaction payments based on block difficulty and price.
Off-chain scaling helps with this, in the form of LN, but we need a stop gap measure. Maybe BCH just wants to plug to hole in the dam with their finger and leave it be, but just because they're shortsighted doesn't mean we have to be overly farsighted. If BTC collapses, it won't be from issues 4 years down the line, it will be from issues in the immediate present. We can't neglect one in favor of the other, they *both* have to be addressed.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:08:15
Let me ask you this, why do people transact BTC for ETH or LTC? It’s so that they can move it and dodge fees, or sell it and dodge fees. Either way, it’s not the same as why people ordinarily conduct like transactions. If you trade a piece of art for a house, you are doing so because you can also use the house as a capital good later typically. It is not to facilitate some other action. People aren’t selling BTC for ETH as a way of diversifying their portfolios, they are doing so in order to perform business transactions, which means that what is nominally a like transaction is actually a purchase of a good or service, which is normally taxable as a capital gain. This is not a special rule for crypto, this is fixing a loophole that incorrectly characterized some particular transaction. People aren’t selling art, buying a house with that art, then immediately selling the house to someone else in exchange for a different piece of art. They are ordinarily doing specific work to maximize value with both assets, either making improvements to a home or waiting for maximum value with art. This is not what is happening with like transactions for crypto.

Glass Steagall wouldn’t have done anything to prevent the 2008 meltdown, it just would have slightly, maybe limited the extent of its damage.
The principal cause of the subprime mortgage crisis was a whimsical societal attitude to the usage of mortgages, coupled with the Community Reinvestment Act mandating that banks had to offer mortgages to low-income and low-credit score individuals, and the rapid expansion of the mortgage market into areas which were basically unexplored and untenable (which is why it was called a housing market bubble. When untenable practices resulted in failure, the bubble collapsed, as bubbles do). Then a Democrat president immediately bailed out the banks and blamed the crisis on trivial rolled-back government legislation, rather than being the result of natural market fluctuations and, to a small degree, government intervention.

There is no such thing as true equality because people aren’t equal. Not everyone is good at math, not everyone is good at sports, not everyone is creative, not everyone has a good sense of intuition, people aren’t equal. 
True equality doesn’t bring individual freedom, it’s achieved by artificially capping the achievements of individuals. Any system based on individual freedom will naturally stratify into overachievers and underachievers. This is how Bitcoin works. People who got in early are overachievers, people who got in late are average achievers, and people who get in at the end are underachievers. Bitcoin doesn’t equalize people. It’s not a social tool. It is a more efficient and secure method of running transactions with the added bonus of things like socializing economic growth or automatically correcting recessions at high adoption values, but it’s not going to magically equalize anyone, except in the sense that it removes differences in economic law across borders by making transactions harder to trace.

The housing market collapsed because it was valuing itself fraudulently and and a result people realized the valuation numbers were off and tried to get out before it caught up with them.
Bitcoin is not going to collapse because its valuations are not based on fraudulent information, they are based on actual assessments of its utility as a medium of exchange that is more reliable, secure, and decentralized than fiat currency. It is not going up because it’s a tulip that happens to be interesting and valuable, it’s going up because it has real, physical utility that fiat currency does not.

Infinite period of time basically just means that just because there's enough resources to fulfill everyone's desires one day doesn't mean there will be the next. The thing you're missing is that scarcity does not mean you don't have enough of what you need, it means you don't have enough of what you want. E.g., even if everyone in the world wants beachfront mansion homes, there is simply not enough space in the world for everyone to have a beachfront mansion home.
The reason that price-capitalist systems are more effective than shared communist systems is that people in an economy can only make economic decisions based on the information that they have. The communist benchmarks for success, the Jewish Kibbutz, had to reneg on their rules for free food for this reason. Since people in the kibbutz had no way to determine the relative availability of food based on its price, and only had access to what they were told, they tended to invite family from outside the kibbutz, or hold lavish dinners with people within the settlement. This resulted in near food shortages frequently, and as a result they instated prices for food that could be earned by working.
This is the value of prices, they convey information on the significance of a goods scarcity to the consumer by allowing them to benchmark its relative power. They also allow the consumer to decide whether a product is worth having or not. If it's too expensive for the value it has to the consumer, for example a jacket with low ratings but a high price tag, the consumer won't buy it. This is why companies aren't just going to create useless but flashy products, because making a product does not obligate consumers to buy it in a capitalist system.
As for your final point, artificial scarcity is not a product of capitalist systems. It is a product of poor government laws or the corruption of officials who stand to benefit from monopolies. Read the article you linked, of the seven possible causes it lists for artificial scarcity, only two (monopolies/cartels and hoarding) are in any way components of capitalist systems, and those phenomena are themselves incredibly rare. The others are all aspects of, often socialist in origin, attempts to control the market via government policy. The very information that you linked doesn't even agree with you.
As for the food and housing points you made, these come from aspects of markets you would not have learned because your socialist leanings cause you to reject economic theory as a basis for why events happen. The reason there is enough food for 10 billion people but others are still hungry is because that food is produced in places where it cannot make it to hungry people effectively. Why? Because those people do not have access to roads, they are far away from the sources of food, or their governments have instituted socialist policies that lead to corruption and economic inefficiency which causes them to go hungry because the food is too expensive where they are.

Oh my god dude, have you ever had even 10 seconds of time where you thought critically about anything?
Communism is based on capitalist economic theory *if specific conditions were to not apply*. It is theoretical, it is not separate. There is no way to achieve it in reality because in reality scarcity dictates that the supply of resources will never equal or exceed the demand for resources over an infinite period of time. Communism is a theoretical system that is possible if this were somehow proven to not be true, if society was able to achieve a scenario where the supply of resources would *always* meet or exceed the demand for resources. 
Since scarcity must always be present on an infinite timeline, people always have to prioritize their actions and resource consumption, which means that resources have to be allocated. Without going deeply into the theory, the most efficient way to do this is by using a medium of exchange that is limited in supply which allows people to say “This item is worth 12% more to me right now than that item, so I will buy this item” and allows producers to say “I can make 11% more producing this item than that item” so I will produce this item. 
You need to understand that there is a difference between what you want to be true and what is true. What you, and all the rest of us, want to be true is that resources are not scarce and you can have anything you want and no one has to suffer never ever ever. What *is* true is that resources are scarce and people have to prioritize the relative value of different factions that this is most expeditiously and efficiently achieved by relying on capitalist systems.

You’re thinking about BTC’s behavior right now and extrapolating that that’s how it’s going to behave forever. It’s not. If BTC becomes a global *currency*, that means it’s value is determined less by supply and demand and more by its purchasing power, but since the supply is fixed its relative purchasing power increases indefinitely. It’s not like housing or land where you’re making a risky investment and there’s the possibility you cannot sell for a turnaround because the market crashes immediately after you buy it. 
Housing markets can expand enormously, well over 100% increases in a few years, but they can also fall to fractions of their initial values. It happens all the time. There are many people who buy houses, remodel them, and find that in that span of time the house is actually worth *less* than it was originally. Bitcoin behaves this way right now because it’s really more of an asset with some utility, but do you honestly think BTC is still going to be crashing to 20% of its value when it hits the 1MM mark? No, it’s not. It’s going to stabilize out and steadily increase in value unless there’s a global market crash, but even that usually means only total economic drops barely into the double digits at most.

It is not private, it is actually very transparent since it’s impossible to truly hide your address. Monero will likely be used for private transactions and will displace Bitcoin as the face of the black market once public markets open to cryptocurrencies.

A communist society without currency only exists when somehow you can produce enough goods that everyone is satisfied, but even basic economic principles states that this is impossible. If you even get close to doing so the population will just increase to create more scarcity.

Hoarding currency. Hoarding non-currency assets means you are taking excess out of circulation when it’s uncalled and then re-entering it into circulation when it is valued. Housing markets and stocks cycle. Currencies like BTC do not.
If I buy a house at the bottom of the market when few people are looking for houses, and sell it at the peak of the market when there’s competition for houses, what I’m actually doing is restricting supply when demand decreases, and increasing supply, when demand increases. It’s a form of equilibrium-generation. If you just sit on currency while it perpetually inflates, you’re not actually controlling for anything or generating any equilibrium, you’re just sitting on assets. There’s no mechanical value to it.

Because the entire point of even having the concept of privilege is to say that it means someone has it better than someone else, but that's based on a monetary perspective of the world, which most research says has very little to do with actual happiness. There are homeless people barely making ends meet who are happier than people sitting in their East End apartments managing their stock portfolios. The notion that the rich guy has it better than the poor guy is ridiculous. If that was the case, why is he poor person happy and the rich person unhappy?
The entire conception of modern privilege is a cheap justification for prejudiced and discriminatory thinking, and it almost always falls along the lines of traditional racial and social divides inside a region. Palestinians think Israelis are privileged and arrogant, Israelis think that Palestinians are privileged and arrogant. Black people in the US think whites are privileged and ungrateful, whites think blacks are privileged and ungrateful. It's a pointless concept used to reinforce divides rather than bridge them.

They were risky loans balanced with unrisky loans. That’s not an ethical qualm, that’s standard practice in all portfolios. You balance riskier stocks with stocks that are pretty reliable, so when the riskier ones tank, the portfolio as a whole survives. That’s called risk management, and for the most part it actually works extremely well. Stocks on the S&amp;P and NasDaq go down every day, some go down a lot, but they’re counterbalanced by highly-performing stocks. No one was composing whole CDOs out of subprime loans and saying “Yeah these loans are great”, they were composing tranches of CDOs out of subprime loans and balancing them with loans that were perfectly fine to mitigate and minimize the risk of holding the CDO.
There was a slight issue in this due to the fact that Fannie Mae, which is *NOT A COMPANY, IT IS A PUBLICALLY TRADED STATE INSTITUTION* (the Federal National Mortgage Association) just started greenlighting CDOs as AAA without even looking at them. Companies cannot market their own loans as AAA if they’re known not to be AAA by regulatory bodies. The problem is that the regulatory bodies just *stopped doing their jobs*.

R/BTC is focused on bitcash, which is a less secure version of bitcoin that attempts to rectify the high cost of transactions by adjusting block sizes. The problem is that it largely exists as a drain on the market capital of bitcoin because it is backed by wealthy miners, it continuously masquerades as bitcoin because they propagandize the fuck out of it, and the transaction problem is going to be solved for BTC in months anyway because LN protocol is coming Q1 2018, which will basically make transaction fees nonexistent and transactions borderline instantaneous. 
It’s more or less a scam. It is continuously marketed as a better alternative to BTC, but no one who invests in it is going to end up making money anyway. Once LN protocol comes out, there will literally be no reason to invest in Bcash anyway. The best criticism they can come up with now is that our developers are antisocial and neurotic.

Yes, but if a bank lends you money for a home and you only repay a portion of it then default, they actually lose a lot of money since the interest is supposed to repay the cost for the bank to buy the property plus the employees and resources needed to bring in the deal. If you only pay back 100K then default, the bank ends up with a house it has to turn around and sell quickly to cover employee incomes and the amount spent on the house in the first place. 
Loans aren’t just “Give some dude money and he might pay it back maybe”, they’re an investment with collateral and careful data analysis done beforehand to make sure they’re profitable. On the lendees side, loans are a way of divesting large costs into smaller more manageable monthly fees. For example, if you’re 30 and you want a house that costs 250K to start a family in, while you’re on a salary of only 50K, it might take you 25 years to afford that house in one payment, because you can only save up for it through direct savings and investment. If you take out a loan, you can divest that into 1,000 monthly, a number which is comparable to a rent payment, you’re just stuck making that payment until the mortgage is paid off. The net result is that you can get your house before retiring, and the bank gets a nice bit of gravy on top of its recouped investment for taking a risk on you.
That’s not just “Here’s some money, pay it back somehow, maybe, we don’t care.”

Centralized means that there is a direct authority in control of something. It means there are rules and regulations and the process is not open to anyone. This means centralized programs can’t be open source. For something to be decentralized, it has to divest authority into a number of different sources, which means for any decent level of decentralization it needs to offer code almost freely, which means it’s open source or very close to it. If someone is going to claim that being open sourced is bad, that also means that decentralization is bad, so if someone says decentralization is actually good you can’t just turn around and shout “NO I NEVER SAID DECENTRALIZATION WAS BAD!” because that is a lie. 
This guy said open-source was bad and useless and had a value of 0. When I told that there is a clear and obvious market for decentralized and open-source banking methods, he gets all pissy claiming that he never said that when he very much did say that.

Exactly, but since utilities and many stores still don't accept BTC, it's not enormously versatile. As that changes, more and more stores will accept it, which exponentially increases its versatility and value as a currency. If it's guaranteed that you can use your BTC, the only thing stopping you is whether or not you have any. As BTC prices start being pegged to specific goods, the influences on value will be standard inflation/deflation (which opens up a can of worms about second-layer fiat systems to prevent deflationary spirals, I won't get into that now), which will dramatically stabilize the price.

So long as there exist goods that people want access to but cannot afford, there will be people who offer access to those goods in exchange for something. Fiat currency isn’t this evil invention that magically appeared out of ~Rothschild Manor~ nowhere and unleashed debt and banking onto the world. Usury has literally existed for thousands of years. All fiat currency does (when it’s run under a central independent bank and thus doesn’t suffer from the problem of being a community resource) is allow for the more efficient allocation of resources by incentivizing the movement of money from private accounts to investment accounts.
Keep in mind, the vast majority of wealth we’re talking about is not held by John Q. Citizen, who has access to resources other people don’t. So long as he’s with a good credit union with a fair monthly interest rate, inflation doesn’t actually affect him in the catastrophic way it can impact private financial entities with large capital holdings. For example, a bank with 350 Billion in asset holdings that allows those holdings to sit in a vault will lose 175 Billion within the span of about 30 years depending on that inflation rate. However, if it moves that 350 Billion into mortgages, CDOs, and stock holdings then it can expand its capital reserves rather than contract them. It also moves capital investments into the economy to the tune of 350 Billion in new mortgages and capital inflows for private companies, which means greater usable economic growth.
I love Bitcoin, but I love it because its tech is fucking beautiful and will rapidly outpace any mechanisms we have for handling commerce right now, not to mention it is enormously liquid across borders. I do *not* love Bitcoin because I believe it will magically alter human biology to make people willing to wait 20-25 years to save up and have access to things the rich could get with a snap of their fingers, rather than make small and affordable monthly installments on them.

All currency systems inevitably resolve to fiat, but good tech can outpace it and cause temporary fluctuations. It’s just whether or not you’re ahead of the curve that determines your success. Fairly certain the dude who first saw gold and thought “That looks cool, I should hold onto it” would have been pretty thrilled when it got adopted as the standard for currency instead of barter, but in the end gold was still debased. Then the people who hoarded greenbacks were thrilled when they became the basis for colonial exchange in the colonies, but that still ended in inflation and fiat currency. Now we hold bitcoin, and it’s great and the tech is wonderful, but it will be made into fiat in its own time. 
Moral of the story: Don’t shit on good tech, but don’t expect it to change fundamental paradigms. Crypto will be made fiat. Not via ethereum, but probably via a BTC second layer or hard-fork.

No one wants to be personally responsible for handling all of their stocks themselves and also all their “shares of their own house” themselves, *and* working 8 hours a day *and* providing security for all their money, just before they can even begin to find things to do. The purpose of money is to facilitate access to goods and services that *improve our lives*, telling people they have to sit on their own currency and monitor it 24/7 in addition to everything else in their lives makes their life *worse*, and disincentivizes their own joining. 
The point of Bitcoin as a commodity that appeals to people is to make people’s lives *easier* by facilitating cheaper movement of money across borders and making transactions quicker with less investment in infrastructure. The point of Bitcoin as a commodity is not to shame people for their buying choices so they waste an extra two hours a day handling money.

If there is a fixed quantity of BTC that can ever exist, then as soon as the %growth of BTC is lower than the %growth of the economy then the currency begins to deflate. If I have 4 bagels and I use 4 stones to represent a bagel, then if I have 8 bagels and still use 4 stones the currency has inflated 100%: one stone is now worth 2 bagels. If your economy grows 4% but your currency only inflates 2%, then your currency actually deflates, because now there is a larger ratio of goods/currency, which is what deflation is.
This is why I've started shilling on here for second-layer or hardforked methods of inflation to be worked on *down the line* because without them financial institutions will never support BTC long-term and will instead pick options like Ether which can manage inflation. I hate this, because Ether is shitty and I don't want people using it over BTC. I would rather see the people who designed LN and Schnorr Protocols finding a way to make an adjustable inflation rate function within the BTC environment than see large businesses' hands forced to inferior crypto methods because of a single, stupid, glaring fault within the BTC community.

Debt isn’t slavery. Debt is distributing unaffordable costs into small installments over time. Do you even grasp how expensive housing can be? Even a mid range home can easily cost anywhere between 100-200K. Your average person makes only about 40-50K at peak earning years, and most of that will spent in the form of rent for current housing and food, not to mention other basic goods and (at peak earning years) childcare. 
Rather than having to spend 20 years saving up to buy a home on what little you can scrape together of savings on top of what you need for retirement, you can divest the costs into relatively small monthly payments over 30 years. For example, to buy a 200K house with a 50K down payment and at an average annual interest rate of 4% over 30 years, you pay literally just $700 a month. And you get that home for an additional 20 years vs. saving up for it, which is literally a quarter of your life.
Inflation facilitates this because it means that your cost relative to your actual income goes *down*. Wages *rise* with inflation. In fact, they rise even *beyond* inflation due to increases in productivity. Your average worker today makes a  more than 10K higher wage compared to the 1970s after adjusting for inflation. But since loan payments don’t change with inflation, loans still being paid today made in the 1970s would have ludicrously small real values, since the payments, calculated for smaller values of inflation, would be tiny. 
Since wages and cost-of-living actually *rise* with the value of inflation, it’s not even a damn tax, in the same way that a stock going down is not a “tax” on your investment. It is a change in the value of a financial commodity as a result of the increased supply of that commodity, and since most money is backed by numbers in a book and not hard assets (which makes it a better currency, not a worse one) economic expansion will *always* result in inflation anyway due to rises in wage earnings and corresponding rise in prices to compensate. Consider inflation the “price” of being financially incompetent and not keeping your money in places where it accumulates value to outpace inflation, like bonds or index funds.

Allocating capital for businesses that need investments works using legal contracts that aren’t adjusted for the real value of currency. That means that loan and capital repayments are affected *very* strongly by the influences of monetary policy. When a currency constantly deflates, then repayments get significantly larger over time adjusted for real value, and can quickly overwhelm people who originally made loans, especially since inflation rates or deflation rates can change.
Since banks have more capital to absorb losses in repayments due to inflation, most monetary policy *favors* inflation. Not to “steal money from poor libertarians” but because inflation provides a cushion against deflationary trends that can punish loan-takers to the benefit of banks. Inflation hits banks hard on later mortgage repayments and long-term loans, but benefits those who wish to take out loans. It also incentivizes people to store their money in the form of stocks and bonds, which fund businesses and, if even moderately managed, can more than pay for their investments in returns each year that outpace inflation. This sub likes to complain about inflation “stealing value from people” but the fact is that it only affects those who are running with bad banks without good interest rates, or those who basically just kept their money under their pillow. For anyone else, inflation is a moderately annoying 2% reduction in profits from stocks each year, but one that is easily out-done by the performance of the market.
Thinking of it as “value” is a bad framework. Think of it as a tool. I have X goods and Y currency to represent those goods with. Now, the currency is basically infinitely divisible, so it’s not like it deflates to the point where it can’t be tracked. The problem is more that if I make an agreement to get X1 goods for Y1 currency at regular intervals for five years, I benefit from an economy where things inflate, because I will pay less in the real value of currency by the end of the contract. When the economy deflates though, I suffer from that, because I will pay more in the real value of currency, so I might opt for contracts that require payment now under pain of law if the producer does not provide (which is riskier, since they may not rule my way or it may not be able to enforced if they flee the country with my money) or make shorter-term contracts. One way incentivizes purchasing at the cost of harming production, one way incentivizes production at the cost of harming purchasing. The difference is that producers have access to more capital than consumers often do, and can more effectively take the punishment of inflationary conditions than consumers can take the punishment of deflationary conditions.

Breaking through the obstinance of BCashers who focus on big blocks is a great first step. It works us towards using Bitcoin for what really makes it valuable: its security and potential efficiency as a currency form. 
Now we need to break through the obsession with the more libertarian element of BTC to focus on keeping the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin. If we can move past that, to maybe a fixed-rate addition of BTC into the system, then we’ve developed the currency system that can power the future: a decentralized, inflation-throttled, ultra-efficient, technologically-advanced currency system. It could support whole economic revolutions, and could even act as a tariff-buster since private keys can be made at-will.

Yes, everyone is talking about future price, but how do you know that they're talking about the future price in unadjusted dollars? People always talk about price in real dollars compared to today. If someone talks about BTC hitting 10K, they're not talking about it hitting 10K because it was stagnant for so long that the USD inflated about 50%, they're talking about it hitting 10K because the size of the BTC market expanded 50% relative to the number of shares.
Saying "Of course BTC can hit 10MM because the dollar will collapse" doesn't make you clever, it makes you pedantic. We all know extremely high BTC values will result in the loss of fiat value as crypto overtakes the market. No one cares, it's not relevant to the discussion. What's being discussed is if crypto will expand to occupy a portion of the market equivalent to 10MM in todays dollars, or the vast majority of the global asset market.

No. Some cars have appreciating value for collectors, but that does not mean they are appreciating assets. A Lamborghini, improperly or poorly maintained, will lose all its value. Certainly, an expensive and rare or limited edition car, properly maintained or sold to exploit temporary production trends (*cough* Tesla Model 3’s *cough*), May catch a much higher value, but the reality is that even luxury cars generally decrease in value. This is not inherent of cars, but of ICE cars. Internal combustion engines produce vibrations that cause continuous and degenerative damage to the car, causing almost inevitable breakdown of parts over time. Without correct maintenance, which can be extraordinarily expensive or complicated, ICE cars lose value irreparably. To properly maintain these cars such that their value is kept far outpaces the amount profited from selling an old car.
The true profit in reselling cars isn’t in selling expensive cars as luxury collector’s items, but in buying ancient cars and flipping them to collectors, since you may be buying little more than a chassis for extremely cheap and rebuilding the car, or buying a car whose damage is surface level and the owner doesn’t always realize or care enough to deal with the small amount of repairs needed.

It’s the same reason that many miners sell bitcoin they make: utility companies and renters are still requiring payments in cash. If I’m a J Crew outlet I have an income from clothing sales but I also have expenses in the form of employee wages, utilities payments, and possibly rent to a mall owner or lot owner. In the end, it’s easier to hold BTC, but harder if not impossible to pay for many required services with BTC, so it has to be immediately liquidated. 
The first step is for small shops to accept it, because they get people used to paying for things with BTC. Once people are used to it, grocery stores may open up BTC payments as an option, especially in cities to reduce lines, which dramatically improves liquidity and market viability because now someone who receives BTC as payment no longer has to sell BTC to get the services they need. When there’s a strong incentive to keep money in BTC, since it can cost to cash it out in the end, then utilities and renters start accepting it as currency, which applies enormous upward pressure since people no longer *need* to cash out for certain fixed payments.

This. It’s not like this is a stock option where you can say “Based on standard valuations models, it will probably have a cap of X, but movements in the near-future might drop it to Y first” and then evaluate how well the price matches your trajectories to determine how accurate you were. The theoretical market cap of Bitcoin is the entire economy of the world. Movements in the near future might be directly to that cap or directly to zero, or they might oscillate up and down. This is an adoption issue, not a valuation issue. It’s like trying to make a prediction about whether or not or how quickly debit cards would catch on.

This is actually ideal. Without inflation, loan contracts or other forms of payment, which are basically the lifeblood of any entrepreneurial enterprise are worthless, because the amounts are legally settled beforehand and the costs of paying back a loan become exponentially higher over time, forcing banks to lower interest rates on offered loans, shutting down smaller banks which might require larger interest rates to even turn a profit. Endless deflation would completely destroy the liquidity for large investments because you can’t divest large expenditures into monthly payments.
If I’m Peter and I’m starting a new factory to produce semiconductors, I might need a capital investment at the beginning for the building. I take out a loan for 200MM at 2% annual interest over 20 years (1 Million per month) to get the factory up and running, but if the currency is deflating at 4% due to economic growth on a fixed amount of coinage, by year 17 I’m paying 2 million per month. If I can’t bring in contracts to cover the steadily rising cost of the loan though, which may not be uncommon, I’ll very quickly go under and default, costing the bank huge amounts of money. The net result is that interest rates go down but the willingness for a bank to accept making a new loan also goes down. More people who need capital will be unable to access it because of stricter conditions on loan offerings to prevent defaults, and the economy will be *less responsive* to the opening of new markets. 
You don’t have to have trade-offs which technology as wonderful as that behind bitcoin. All you need to do is open the market to contracts which cover BTC and conduct transfers by actually moving BTC and then allowing the banks themselves to cover it in the form of contracts. That keeps the liquidity of BTC as a currency at its peak without sacrificing the enormous advantages of an inflation-based economy in aiding economic growth.

Interesting. As a footnote, this suggests that over 5 years it may be more profitable to get into Monero than Bitcoin, predicting a 180x , while predicting only a 14x increase in BTC prices. We often think of Litecoin as being the silver to BTCs gold, but the advent of LN may push Litecoin out, so it does make sense that the privacy aspect of XMR compared to BTC would become relevant, whereas the speed aspect of LTC or ETH really isn’t.

Hint: "They" is money
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:39:02
This. I’ve commented this elsewhere but the “Sell everything, buy a lambo” shtick is very man-child like. The idea is that you spend money to invest, the money matures, you have more money, and you use that to further invest. Someone who invests their money in an index fund that follows the NasDaq or S&amp;P500 after they graduate college and get their first job will have, on average, about 5 doubling times (about 10 years for index funds) until they retire, 7 until they die. That means that you can generally take the money you invest and multiply it by anywhere between 32 and 128 to determine how much you will have at the end of your life. Given the advances in modern medicine, it is also pretty likely that we will see average retirement push higher, even into the 80s and 90s, which suggests that you may have 7 doubling times until you can *stop working*, not just until you die and the money is inherited by your kids.
The serious advantage of strong investments like Bitcoin, or Apple/Google in the 90s, is that they can bypass those doubling times. I have about $1400 in BTC. If it reaches maximal saturation that could probably be worth anywhere between $150K-$300K. In other words, this early investment bypasses the equivalent of 7-8 doubling times. I can, with an investment now, have the same amount of money I would leave to my grandkids if I just held that $1400 in a fidelity account. Then, I can take that 300K and spend it on a house, or stick it into a fidelity account and be able to retire with a guaranteed 9 million dollars at only age 70. Enough for an annual income of 300K until I was 100, or 100K until I was 160. That’s not even accounting for how much the money might grow while I was consuming it. Hell, at 9M as long as you leave most of the money in an account you can survive indefinitely on 100K per year because the growth rate outpaces your spending.
Obviously the limited amount of BTC in circulation means the economics of such a situation becomes indefinitely more complicated at peak saturation. There are other factors to account for, like the consistent deflation of money, and whether or not a soft or hard fork expands the total amount of BTC to level out the deflationary curve. However, the basic mathematics of stock investment remains the same.
EDIT: Just to clarify, a doubling time is 70 or 71 depending on who you ask, divided by the percentage rate of growth. It gives you approximately the t for the Pe^rt function when you’re finding a final value twice your principle value. Also known as the rule of 70 or rule of 71. For index funds, which have averaged about 7% growth for most of their existence, the doubling time is about 10 years. Some other funds can claim a doubling time of 3-5 years, but I am skeptical of that right now. Mutual funds have a doubling time of around 35 years if I remember correctly, which I’m pretty sure does not account for management fees.

It’s price is a measure of its valuation, which is indicative of how many transactions it can really be used for. It’s not that we only care about going to the moon, it’s that when we hit the moon, the 1M mark, that means that bitcoin has achieved the equivalent market value of the United States, which means that its usefulness for small transactions is becoming increasingly significant.
Yes, some speculators want to get rich by investing in crypto, but everyone should want the price to go up. Since there’s only 21 million bitcoin, that means that to achieve full adoption we need to stretch 21 million units to the full size of the global economy. That requires a valuation of about 1-3 million per bitcoin.

Okay, I’m reading through it again and I’m seeing where you’re coming from here, so let me clarify:
Predatory people like exploiting others, they lie, gaslight, abuse, insult, all that stuff. They may be highly narcissistic or have serious mental disorders. Entrepreneurship classes specifically teach you how to achieve financial goals through the movement of a product from beginning stage to end stage, and how to recognize financially good and bad ideas. In doing so they can teach you a lot about handling money and weaknesses in current business practice.
When I say predatory people with entrepreneurship training are “dangerous” I’m not talking about someone’s poorly drawn Sonic OC, what I mean is that they become highly manipulative people with a good business sense. They may do what OP dealt with and try to copyright things to exploit and harass people for money. They may start debt collection agencies and intimidate or threaten poor or old people into giving money they don’t have. They may fake their phone numbers to appear like a legitimate call and then conduct “IRS Tax Evasion” or “There is a warrant out for your arrest” type scams that take advantage of people’s fear of jail or a criminal record. They are, effectively, extremely manipulative people who have the tools to channel that into exploiting people for money. These people can be “dangerous” because they can seriously damage people who fall for their tricks, especially small businesses or old people who don’t have tons of money to spare.
I realize the point I made was kinda easy to interpret in a cringe sense since I didn’t really make it very clear what I meant, so I hope this seems more reasonable.
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:24:14
It’s an exaggeration, but you can actually be trained in entrepreneurship as a shortcut to developing the skills yourself. It’s effectively just a way of getting people to use marketing analysis and creative thinking to develop ideas to pursue, rather than necessarily adopting an idea and pushing it to completion with the full risks associated.

Twitter is a censorship apparatus. It is most likely an extension of CIA/FBI projects like Operation Mockingbird which were designed to infiltrate the media. Twitter and Facebook create the illusion of public support for an issue by censoring one side and promoting the other, and as a result more timid people may change their views or hide them to avoid public persecution from perceiving themselves in the minority. Independent reporters like Project Veritas have literally *caught programmers and workers from twitter on camera admitting that they do this*. The most obvious case of this rn is the Tommy Robinson arrest, which is incredibly low in the trending list despite having much higher numbers of tweets and activity over the last couple days.

Yes you do. If you just hire people to do the innovations for you, you’re not an entrepreneur you’re a manager. Every single entrepreneur has had specialized knowledge of their area and the creative drive. JC Penny, Sears and Robuck, A&amp;P Grocers, Amazon, Microsoft, Mac, Facebook, the list goes on and on. Every single one of these companies was founded by a person with highly specialized knowledge in the area within which they operated. Yes, they hired more employees too, but having specialized knowledge doesn’t mean you can’t also have help. Someone with experience only in railroads cannot found tech company and be wildly successful simply because he hires some incel programmer, because specialized knowledge brings with it the understanding of the failures of the current system, and knowing the failures of the current system and being able to find solutions using your specialized knowledge is what makes an entrepreneur. Showering money and someone else isn’t entrepreneurship, it’s venture capitalism.

There's still a great deal of pain felt in the community from when the transaction prices skyrocketed last year. I think many people, especially those waiting for the bull run, are consciously or unconsciously concerned that the bull run will start and the infrastructure will not be able to easily accommodate such a rise in demand again. Remember that while segwit helps, transactions are a market, and any spike in demand will produce transaction cost increases at the expense of longer times. While segwit greatly helps manage demand, it is not the 40% increase in block usage that causes the demand to skyrocket, it's the 2% after that which creates competition for block space and sends prices up.

No, because original products have additional value from their originality and recognizable brand. Copies retain all their benefits but are noticeably not original and try to steal value by copying a brand.
If I asked you whether you wanted Cheese-its or "Costco-Brand Square Cheese Crackers" which would you pick, even if qualitatively and cost-wise they were the same? Originality is a value which makes a product better. Between two otherwise identical products, copies always have less value than originals. 
This, of course, comes with the additional fact that BCash is a copy of Bitcoin which then retained none of Bitcoin's flexibility and desire for innovation and is instead implementing the same old solutions over and over again. BCash does not have segwit, it does not have schnorr, it does not have LN, it does not have smart contracts, its devs don't even tolerate discussion of second-layer protocols. So, it's a copy of Bitcoin, made with old technology, which is inflexible and refuses to change.

Computers aren’t magic boxes that take in SCIENCE! and electricity and suddenly become better at running games and mining crypto. They’re massive arrays of electrical components like capacitors which have actual limits on the size of their construction. You can’t build a capacitor or an op-amp that’s smaller than a single atom because *they’re made of atoms*, and at around 10nm you’re getting extremely close to actual atomic-sized components, which is extremely inefficient because of how circuits work, unless you can find likely very expensive materials to use in CPU construction. You can make *other* processes more efficient, like cooling or circuitry, so that you have more room for semi-conductors and such, but there are actual fucking limits on how efficient a computer chip can be.

Because most hydroelectric dams aren’t used for energy generation, they’re used for energy storage. During the day, the dams are active, generating electricity when needed, but at night they turn off and excess electricity from other plants is used to pump water back *up* the dam. That’s how the electrical grid accommodates the massive difference in power usage from peak to minimum demand. 
If the dams were active constantly to run bitcoin mining farms, not only would their reservoirs deplete, but you would have rolling blackouts because there would be no time when the excess grid load from other plants would be stored, and as a result there would not be enough energy generation to supply everyone.

Do I believe bitcoin will replace fiat? Yes
Do I believe that bitcoin works as a currency? Yes
Do I own Bitcoin? Yes, I have about .13BTC in an electrum account.
Do I believe that a fixed amount of currency available functions effectively for a large scale economy? Well... not really. I don’t necessarily believe in fiat, but as long as lending is legal lending will occur. There will always be people willing to make loans, there will always be people who want to buy things they cannot afford. The notion that BTC will lead to the end of banks ventures dangerously into statements of “People should...”not “People will...”, and “People should...” statements are the most dangerous thing ever, because they conflate personal conviction with reality, and using that to make a plan is disastrous. Lending will exist, and the likely case is that Bitcoin will completely revolutionize payment systems, do serious damage to the banking system, but people will always want things they can’t afford and people will always be willing to lend them that money in exchange for interest. That system is the basis for banking, and bitcoin, deflationary or not, will not change that fact.
The most likely scenario is this: people will expect Bitcoin to deflate, FOMO will apply pressure for people to join, and this will result in peak adoption. Banks will then lobby for an IOU system, or a soft/hard fork to allow for money supply expansion, to at the very least allow for BTC “printing” to counteract deflation. The net result will be a dramatic improvement in the efficiency of the global money supply, with reduced inflation, but it will not be a currency with some fixed money supply. That is not going to stick around for very long if BTC becomes popular.

As a comparison, in menswear we have MTOs, sites and companies that keep costs low by reducing inventory via only producing as many clothes as are ordered and shipping them all at once a while from the order time (usually a few weeks or even a couple months)
It’s very true that inventory and storage is a high cost, and many of these companies produce exceptional products (Beckett Simonon, e.g.) for a very low price relative to the quality, but for many people low cost = low quality so all they see is a low cost and a high waiting time, and may skip. People looking at this may see cheap services, which can be helpful, but they may also associate cheap services with low quality on the sellers part, and choose alternatives for certain projects.
A 17% difference may be too much. Slightly undercharging your competition with the justification of BTC may be more advantageous. Maybe 15% instead of 20% service charge, and heavy marketing. Once the consumer base is established and you know you can outdo your competition, twist the screws on them and start dropping service prices.

Instead it’s owned by an NGO with its own agenda and funded by wealthy doners who like when it prints certain material. You don’t think it’s quality because it’s good, you think it’s quality because it’s good *in your opinion*, which just means you probably agree with 90% of what it writes.

Obviously you’re not required to go there but on r/T_D all posts used to consistently get downvoted massively within seconds of posting, and usually kept a max 70-80% upvote ratio. After the quarantine this disappeared, and the explanation given for it is that most likely that bots were automatically downvoting and commenting on things with certain tag words, but since getting past quarantine requires manual response they’re no longer able to access the sub.
I expect that many political advocacy organizations have bot farms that automatically downvote or respond on posts with tag words, in this case “Gab”, but it’s also the case that people massively slander Gab as being full of Neo-Nazis when the proportional number of posts from admitted net-Nazis is roughly comparable to that of Twitter.

Realistically, in an end-game scenario where Bitcoin reaches its max increase, it's only really deflationary at the average rate of economic growth.
The thought for BTC distopia is "Oh, eventually people won't make anything because they'll just sit on their BTC" but that's not really true. There's a downward pressure on spending and upward pressure on saving, a factor I think does need to be taken into consideration, but you could never just sit on your coins and expect to make a living unless you were fabulously wealthy. Your real wealth would only increase by like 2-3% per year. In terms of dollars, even if you had a $1,000,000 sitting in a bank increasing at 3% real value per year you'd only have a real income of like $30,000 a year.
The place where this becomes an issue economically isn't because people will sit on their asses, but because it applies an upwards performance pressure on businesses. A company seeking to get capital now has essentially a death percentage: &lt;2% annual return, because at less than 2% annual return you can literally just hold your assets in a bank and make more money than this company would for you. That will be hard on already struggling retailers, or sectors with small annual returns.

Maybe, but recessions are great for markets. It’s called a cycle for a reason. During expansions, the market grows, start-ups prosper, and there’s a capital influx. When the expansion ends and the recession starts, the start-ups eat each other and the capital bleeds out, but those who invested wisely are rewarded and those who invested poorly get burned. The net result is that the most innovative startups survive or are consumed by stronger companies, the market reaches bottom, stabilizes, and capital starts flowing in again. The constant cycle of growth and recession benefits everyone: it encourages innovation, while purging useless innovation and larger, more stubborn businesses from the marketplace. Someday this ~~May~~ will kill Bitcoin. It’s what always happens. Few, if any, businesses in capitalist countries are more than a hundred years old, and the ones that are are often small businesses in niche markets or encourage high turnover of upper management to prevent stagnation. Bitcoin will grow, hit its peak, and either innovate radically or be replaced by someone else. No matter what, Bitcoin *as we know it* will be dead eventually. LN already makes Bitcoin radically different than it was 5 years ago, and 5 years from now it may be radically different in other ways. So long as that continues, we’ll be fine, but eventually it will be replaced by some other method of storing and transferring value, just like fiat is being replaced by crypto today.

@_date: 2018-06-01 20:58:58
Well, yes. You answered your own question. A bank doesn’t need to have the same amount of money on hand as it lends out. It may be legally required to, but if a bank can’t survive a money run that doesn’t actually impact the bank—until of course there’s a money run. An economy run on bitcoin entirely, if banks have to match investments to their reserves and deposits rather than liabilities, would never grow. It would just enter a deflationary spiral because the total value of the entire economy could never exceed a fixed value of 24M BTC. Banks, however, only have to have a certain amount of money available in reserves, and the rest is covered in the form of liabilities. When banks loan money, that money is stored in the forms of assets, investments, or new deposits. 
Say Peter deposits 100mBTC in his local TD Bank. The bank then lends 90mBTC to Paul, who takes that and then deposits it back in TD Bank under a business account. The bank now has a possible lending reserve of 190mBTC, including the 90mBTC it has already lent out. In other words, there does not have to be a 1:1 match between reserves and liabilities. Let’s say Paul doesn’t deposit the 90mBTC into TD Bank though, let’s say he uses it to buy 100 shares of Exxon Mobile stock. Exxon Mobile, or whoever he bought the stock from can then deposit that 90mBTC in a different bank, which will then lend that money out to someone else. 
What about assets though? Let’s say Paul uses that 90mBTC for a car loan, what happens to the money then? Well, a portion of it essentially goes to the car manufacturer, because the car dealer paid for the car, and that portion of the cost doesn’t really go to the dealer in any meaningful sense because the dealer has to pay for a new car to place on the lot instead of the one he just sold. Of the portion that does stay at the dealer though, it will be distributed among the employees in the form of wages, most of which will go back to, you guessed it, the bank.
“But u/greyhoundfd”, you might say, “What if they just keep it in an electrum account or a ledger? Not your keys, not your crypto!” Well, yes. That money does not go back to the bank. Neither does cash you store in a safe at your house, but even extremely wealthy people with money for complicated and foolproof security systems will keep their money in banks. It’s not because the bank is magically more secure, it’s because the bank may offer convenience features or incentives not normally available. Consider this: one of the advantages of LN is that it decentralizes the costs of BTC payments. Rather than a few main nodes handling most traffic, or massive networks of expensive (but profitable) mining machines, LN nodes allow for traffic to be handled rapidly and cheaply with very little actual cost. Compare that to the expense and hassle that Visa, for example since they’ve had a network failure just today, has to deal with. Visa does not want to maintain a distribution network, it’s expensive and unprofitable. Visa is a bank, and it wants to do banking. Suppose Visa knew customers had the tools to handle money in the form of BTC without deposits, but wanted to retain customers? They would likely reinvest the money from their card network into utilities and convenience features that incentivized people to keep BTC in Visa-associated banks, rather than on ledgers or electrum.

There is a non-negligible number of older people who just buy flip-phones because they find smartphones and iOS confusing and difficult to manage. I encounter these people regularly. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 04:23:41
By any reasonable standards a flip-phone is also harder to use than a smartphone for making calls, but some people still prefer the former. It has nothing to do with the actual complexity of the task, it has to do with self-confidence, trust, and the capability to adapt to new information. Especially when it comes to money, many people are going to favor trust as the highest factor. While hard keys are still extremely secure, many people will still see it as just sticking money under the mattress and as being unsecure. In general, people enjoy the banking system because even though it comes with some drawbacks, **it places the responsibility for active protection of money in someone else's hands, which means the person does not have to think about their financial security as much, and failure results in someone else holding the blame**.
Bitcoin is extremely secure, yes. But if you screw up, you can't sue someone and get compensation. *You* are responsible. If you lack confidence in your abilities, either due to legitimate difficulty or simply lack-of-trust, you will not want to use new financial tools. You will want to give it to someone else to handle it for you, especially if that person can be held legally responsible if the money is misplaced.

If it hits 100K I’m selling immediately. My price target is 80K, if the bull market is aggressive enough I might HODL to a higher target, then I’m liquidating it and sitting on it until it corrects. I doubt this will be a rerun of the last bull, but even with aggressive expansions every market has a cap. Not that I’m professionally trained in valuation or market analysis, but I would honestly be astonished if BTC at its current infrastructure state could effectively handle a market over 100k per coin.

1) Google paid one of their first painters in google stock shares. The plain fact is that most people don’t care about deflation vs. the cost of a good, they just want what they want with whatever currency is most suited to that. Frankly, the answer to your question is simpler than most economists care to think it is: “Why do people want to spend bitcoin if it’s deflationary?” “Because they do.”
2) The same goes here. Bitcoin will continue to deflate, but you also need to consider that there are and always will be altcoins with different values. Bitcoin is never going to be the world currency. If it is, it will need higher divisions of currency (and subsatoshi demarcations do exist, theoretically), but this actually strongly encourages investment. Imagine you’re a Zimbabwean investor and you invest some 100 quintillion Zimbabwean dollars into a project, and then the currency inflates even more and suddenly you have actually lost value because the inflation renders all your past purchases overly expensive.
Economists assume that inflation means people will invest to match their inflation rate and everything will balance. In truth it means that any investment has to perform at a certain level of success to return any real improvement in value to its investors. It narrows the margin of companies that are useful as investment opportunities.
3) There are literally dozens of explanations for how the 1973 oil crisis ended. The geopoliticians say it ended because of geopolitics, the Keynesians say it ended because of Keynesian economics, the libertarians say it ended because of actions by libertarian economists. Everyone has a different explanation.

Bitcoin doesn’t have to be a currency *right now*. Its most valuable use is what it always has been: a more secure form of gold, that increases in value to a greater extent. Its currency utility is secondary. Not because fiat is superior, it isn’t, but because the fact that bitcoin deflates instead of inflates is infinitely more valuable than its use as a medium of exchange. Fiat works fine as a medium of exchange for 99% of the world, but it’s shitty as a value holding asset for 100% of the world.
This is why no one gives a fuck about transaction speeds. They care about feeling that their money is secure and protected, not that it’s useful. Your average person will deal with 1 minute transaction confirm times if you promise them a mansion when they retire.

No. I say as someone who invested in BTC that that would a terrible, terrible idea.
Investment is done on levels of risk. Savings goes in things like Roth IRAs, or mutual funds, or bonds. Speculative investing, like what we're doing, is something where it's okay to go into high risk assets because you usually diversify your holdings so if BTC just suddenly collapses for no reason everything else is insulated. The reason people often look down on BTC isn't because it's a bad investment. It's a great investment, that's why I invested in it. People dislike it because it breeds this atmosphere of fanaticism that is *bad* for investment.

In the meantime, the only person indicted by Mueller who is even relatively significant is a guy we’ve known was working with Russia and Ukraine for literally *a year*, and was fired by Trump coincidentally after his first National Security briefing, which should make it more than obvious that when he was told he had a Russian mole in his campaign he removed the mole.

It probably won’t crash much, or it might crash a lot, but it will crash at least a little because users who support Segwit2x will move to S2x,leveling off some demand for BTC and bringing the price down a bit.

As a direct competitor to BTC in BTC's stated goal? No. Bitcoin is the best asset for global transactions that are secure, fast, and provable, especially because it is constantly iterating and upgrading its technology. Even if a person doesn't believe that crypto is some magical wand that will destroy the banking system, the incredible promise of the system as a new basis for global transactions is clearly apparent. That's why I support it, despite also supporting many parts of the financial system that are hated by people here.
But BTC doesn't, as a condition of its goal, supply things that some people want. I would say that ETH, XMR and LTC are generally accepted by BTC maximalists. ETH and XMR in particular have very different purposes from BTC. LTC takes a different approach to the same goal, which is generally not favored but is useful in some periods, like when there's a lot of market activity and transaction fees start rising.

The explanation I’ve heard is basically that tether claims they’re backed by 600m USD, which some people are questioning. If it turns out that the hack was fake, as a method of hiding that they don’t actually have this money, it means that an enormous portion of the USD invested into bitcoin doesn’t actually exist, which means that exchanges which rely on tether for backing their own buy/sell orders might end up with nothing when they try to collect. This could effectively mean that even though bitcoin transactions *are* on the rise, the real USD value of bitcoin is extremely low compared to its current value, and when the charade ends the price will halve.
Now, it’s also possible the amount of tether people have invested is actually very small, which would mean the impact might be 10-20%. This is practically nothing. It sets us below 8,000, but it wouldn’t be as bad as the drop from Roger Ver’s shenanigans a month ago.

Actually, BTC is traditionally associated with the new-populist group you’re talking about. The vast majority of support for BCH and such is people who don’t understand the purpose of crypto or who disagree about its intentions.

No, *you* don't understand. You can't inflate a currency by creating more subdivisions of that currency. No one is creating more satoshi, what they are talking about is implementing fully functional measures of tracking micro satoshi measurements, which is already done by some sites on a theoretical basis. This can't create inflation because inflation is entirely unrelated to the subdivisions of currency available. If you added two decimal places and called that the new Satoshi *technically* that would be inflation, but only if you didn't retroactively convert payment values.
What happens now with rounding up vs rounding down is that if a good should ideally be worth somewhere between 2 and 3 satoshi, you have to pick one, rounding up or down from its ideal price. If we add more subdivisions though, you have to round less. So instead, you could charge 2.55 Satoshi for your good. *This does not increase the number of satoshi*, all it lets you do is more closely approximate the value of your goods in satoshi.

I mean, yes, but arguably by the same token the existence of the market itself is a form of rent seeking. "Creating wealth" is a difficult term because the verb "creating" implies a physical action, like labor or coordination. The reality is that many things that don't initially appear to be "creating" wealth are absolutely the creation of wealth. Charging significantly above-margin prices for a product to stay competitive is often portrayed as a way of taking money from others without creating wealth. The same could be said for, coincidentally, renting apartments. Most commonly, investment banking, charging interest, and venture capitalism are portrayed as stealing wealth for yourself, when in reality the great benefits of these practices for the economy are readily visible to those who have even very little experience with economics.
When you talk about "manipulating" a market, that has very concrete meanings. [This legal group]( provides a decent list of actual examples of market manipulation, though it's definitely not comprehensive. What's likely happening with bitcoin is just that people who have lots of bitcoin are choosing to buy or sell are different times to maximize their holdings. They're likely not even doing so purposefully. I'd bet that many just have auto-trades set up to run at certain price windows that they just progressively move. That's not market manipulation, that is using good stock practice on a market where you just happen to hold a large share.

“Gaslighting, an elaborate and insidious technique of deception and psychological manipulation, usually practiced by a single deceiver, or “gaslighter,” on a single victim over an extended period. Its effect is to gradually undermine the victim’s confidence in his own ability to distinguish truth from falsehood, right from wrong, or reality from appearance, thereby rendering him pathologically dependent on the gaslighter in his thinking or feelings.” -Brittanica
Suggesting that the people who disagree with you are mentally ill is gaslighting, even if you suggest that they see a professional, because the implication is that their political view is what defines their mental illness, not their actually being mentally ill.

This is patently untrue, in multiple ways, because it’s untrue for banks as both moneylenders and moneyholders.
1) Banks have enormously improved financial inclusion as moneyholders. Previous to banks’ existence, moneyholding had to be performed by the individual, and as such could only be effectively done by those with enough money to provide for their own security. This meant nobles, proto-capitalists, brigands, and governmental leaders. Because banks are started with high amounts of capital, they can provide security while also allowing those who are poor to store their money inside. Yes, I realize that inflation infringes on this guarantee of security, but everyone losing X% of their initial investment due to inflation is far more democratic than everyone below a certain capital threshold losing 100% of their investment while those above it lose 0%.
2) Banks as money lenders have dramatically increased inclusion because loans collateralize large expenditures into multiple small expenditures. Because of this, those with small incomes who might have to wait decades to save up money for large purchases can do so immediately by spreading the cost out over a longer period of time, into payments they can afford. This is far more inclusive than a system incapable of moneylending. In a system incapable of moneylending, it would be impossible for the poor to decide that they wanted to start businesses, or own houses, or even buy a car, without waiting years if not decades to save up to buy it wholesale.
Bitcoin certainly makes the former more inclusive: instead of needing a bank, value can be stored at home, or in more secure vaults, but far more secure than dollar bills under the mattress. However, it is far less capable of the latter because it is inherently deflationary, which means that it disfavors the lendee. 
So what is the utility of bitcoin? That it’s more secure and more capable of handling cross-border, or wartime, or high-volume transactions. Not that it increases inclusivity. It does not. Since the amount is fixed, bitcoin is fundamentally incapable of increasing financial inclusivity by allowing the poor to subdivide large purchases into affordable increments.

This clearly states that average viewership for Fox News during major programs is 2.3 million, while between CNN and MSNBC it’s only 2.1 million. Every article since then has said that Fox is topping its competition for audience growth, even if they haven’t listed direct viewership comparisons.
I have rarely if ever seen a small business or bar which plays Fox, I’ve usually seen either MSNBC or CNN, so I’m curious where you found that Fox is on at most small businesses. It’s generally known that CNN has contracts with most airports to be the default station, but I have not heard anything about Fox’s numbers in small businesses.

I'm not talking about whether or not it's legally okay. I'm talking about whether it's morally okay. It is not morally okay to refuse to do business with someone on the basis of the fact that they do not censor groups you do not like.
You're calling me a lost cause, but you don't even know what you're talking about. My approval or lack there-of for the president has 
# ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING
to do with whether or not it is morally acceptable for internet sites to be deplatformed on account of their refusal to selectively censor political speech. I would think this is unacceptable regardless of whether the people being censored were left wing or right wing. I would think it was unacceptable regardless of whether the people being censored were moderate or radical. I would think it was unacceptable even if it was about non-political issues, like sexuality or religious stance. You have no evidence *whatsoever* that Gab is "faux-libertarian". You are attempting to dehumanize a website because it makes you feel better about your hypocrisy. Then, to top it off, you're trying to hide this by making it about *my* political stance.

Hmm, I should clarify that banks are important for inclusion in the start-up of brick-and-mortar stores or other high-capital start-ups, which people often cannot finance themselves independently.
It is, however, very true that banks are extremely slow to expand financial access to those who aren't immediately near branches, or are "unbanked". The amount of capital and coordination needed to establish reliable banking networks is simply so high that this process takes forever regardless, and bitcoin is useful in bypassing this entire process.

The question then is "Is there a moral basis for resembling *any* fundamental laws?" and the answer would be "No", because you can't selectively say "This one law which defends basic rights is worth promoting in your own life, but this other one isn't" without engaging in hypocrisy.

But that's hypocritcal. The only difference between hate speech and regular speech is an arbitrary moral distinction. It's the equivalent of saying "I'm against censorship except when it's focused on opinions which I find morally detestable", which is tautological. No one supports censorship of opinions that they *like*. You're essentially just saying "I'm for censorship of my political opposition". So where does that end? 
No one who claims that hate speech is an absolute category says it ends at "I hate Jews" or blatant examples like that. It expands into *implied* racism and anti-semitism, then *subtle* racism and anti-semitism, then opinions which *evoke the spirit* of racism and anti-semitism. It essentially comes down to the personal opinions of those reading it. What's hate speech to one person might not be hate speech to another. **If you can provide me an objective, deterministic test for whether something is or isn't hate speech, I will admit that I was wrong, apologize for calling you a hypocrite, and admit we both have valid, but conflicting, opinions on this issue.**

I don’t care whether you’re American, Russian, or a fucking Thargoid. Inciting violence for the sake of advancing your Agenda is dangerous and never ends well. At best it can be used to prevent worse violence, but it never ends in a manner that improves the overall situation.

Of course you can lend money. Lending doesn’t require fiat currency inflation to operate, it only requires that you have more money than the amount that you borrowed accumulate so that you can pay back the interest too. Since money always circulates through an economy, this is easy to do no matter whether the currency is inflating or deflating, unless it deflates by a lot at once.

I’m not lying, you’re calling me wrong because some random people who are completely irrelevant as measures of the whole system did something. If some random ass person doesn’t like Bitcoin, it isn’t indicative of the success of the whole system. I don’t like all these people who only just started posting on this sub claiming that they’re the new oracle of Omaha because they magically know that Bitcoin is completely failed as a system. The fact that Tesla as a stock goes down doesn’t mean their cars don’t work, just like the Nasdaq dropping doesn’t indicate that the US Economy is defunct or the dotcom bubble indicated that the internet was a failed project. 
Prices are a reflection of people’s current valuation of certain goods or ideas, they are not reflective of the efficacy of those ideas by any objective means whatsoever. If Bitcoin goes down it means fewer people are buying Bitcoin so the price is dropping to attract new investors. It does not mean that Bitcoin is a failed project or that Bitcoin is suddenly widely unpopular. It’s a speculation, it still will be speculation until probably around 50k to 100k in value. To reflect that, small mom and pop businesses are not and *should not* adopt BTC as a primary payment system. Large businesses are because they can shoulder the volatility and they recognize that expanding adoption will pay off in the long run.

I’m not saying calling bitcoin BTC is wrong, it’s absolutely correct, just that people who haven’t had much exposure to it will assume that BTC is the base unit.

People talk about how you can't have debt with Bitcoin but you absolutely *can* still have debt. There is literally 0 reason why someone couldn't loan you 1btc in exchange for monthly payments of .001 BTC in return on a 10% interest rate. There are two principle differences between an economy in multiple fiat and an economy in BTC
1) An economy with one currency with fixed rates ease transaction difficulty, and means that BTC will inflate or deflate to match economic expansion, probably requiring the lifting of several regulations on prices
2) In times of recession, this will greatly incentivise buying, since BTC losing value means it will make more sense to buy things you need than to stick to a normal model.

That’s a stupid statement. People disagree with news all the time. People decide that something which was reported didn’t really happen, or that it happened a different way, and they often do so with absolutely no basis for this whatsoever other than that someone else said differently in their own newspaper. Few of the many people who decide that a newspaper isn’t worth their time do so because they have direct knowledge of the events being reported and know that they are false. 
I doubt anyone here shouting that Fox is propaganda knows personally that Fox intentionally misrepresented events in a way that they personally know to be fallacious and that they did so explicitly to push a political agenda. What they actually mean is “NYT/WaPo/Snopes/Bloomberg said X and Fox said Y, so Fox must be wrong and lying to push a political agenda”, or, even worse, what they could mean is “I know absolutely nothing about Fox News but I have seen memes on r/politics calling Hannity a moron so obviously Fox is propaganda”. The former is wrong simply because it doesn’t investigate any reason for the discrepancy, but assumes it. The latter is so patently absurd and moronic that anyone who thinks and realizes this is the case for them should do some deep reflection and question how they got to the point where they judge things they know absolutely nothing about and thinks that makes them morally superior.

In what possible way can video games be used to help further any kind of development you have? At least being on reddit helps give you access to information on current events and new ideas. Video games are just a way to pass the time at best. I play them sometimes, but I don’t make excuses about it. I’ll run a round of R6 Siege when I’ve got 30 minutes to kill and don’t feel like sitting down for something else.
It’s not about “enjoying different things in life”, it’s about productive versus unproductive ways of passing time. Almost every single way of passing time known to man can somehow contribute to your development in another area. Even reading is known to dramatically improve neuroplasticity and helps development in other areas. 90% of video games have skill development that is entirely limited to the game. Map knowledge in R6 doesn’t help you have a family and be happy when you stop playing the game. It improves no one’s lives. It’s applicable only to success in the game. 
On top of that, they rely on rapid-cycle action-reward patterns that basically set you into a track where unless you recognize the game isn’t important, you play the game on repeat until either you burn on or you lose interest. It’s like heroin, but without withdrawal. You play because it’s fun and since it doesn’t have withdrawal symptoms it’s easy to say “Oh, it doesn’t matter how much time I spend doing this because I can stop any time”. It’s not like alcoholism, you *can* stop any time, but you don’t because it’s fun and there doesn’t seem to be any reason to stop until you give yourself some reason.
The deflationary aspects of bitcoin limit its use as a currency *right now*, but past 80% adoption they’re basically negligible. At 100% adoption, it socializes economic growth and auto-corrects for recessions.

Because nations routinely express opinions on who should and should not be elected in other countries. Nations are not magical bubbles in space, what happens in Canada effects us, just like what happens in the US affects Russia. Russian citizens and even the Russian government have the right to provide information they feel is relevant and make their opinions known. There is literally nothing wrong with that.

That’s sort of true and sort of not true. Bitcoin and other cryptos provide a mechanism for direct-order drugs, but the fact is that fentanyl would likely have spread to the states regardless. Unlike what TV tells people, drug dealers can be anywhere. They can be students at school, a guy at the gym, a coworker, not just some gangbanger on a street corner. Ease-of-access tends to be a very minor concern when it comes to addicts. They have a very high tolerance for difficulty of acquisition, and more likely than not this would have happened anyway.
Bitcoin aids this by making *all* transactions more secure, which can help drug sales but has a host of other effects as well.

Prison Labor in the US is not slave labor. The actual production jobs like UNICOR are relatively high paying compared to other forms of prison labor, and usually consist of making things like army uniforms that don't go for final sale on the market. They are the vast minority of jobs available though, most of which might be kitchen work for the prison, librarian work for the prison, or other maintenance jobs.
"Prison labor" in China (I.e., real slave labor), might consist of, for example, peeling garlic by hand for 16 hours a day with no break until your fingernails literally fall out. You get no pay, you're just expected to do it or you'll be beaten
Basically, so-called "Prison slave labor" in the US is basically just chores and maintenance for the prison, it keeps costs down, and is paid work. Prison slave labor in China is all-day, required at penalty of beatings, unpaid, and goes directly to enriching the government by selling the goods abroad.

Look, I get it. People don't like inflation. It's a silent tax. But you have to have it. At the very least, you need to print money to counteract deflationary spirals, which can paralyze entire countries and lead to the shutdown of investment banking, which is the most critical component of economy because it guarantees that startups and valuable innovators can receive money from those interested in their creations. It stagnates innovation. The advantage of bitcoin is not that it's immune to inflationary trends by having a fixed money supply. The advantage of bitcoin is that, being mathematically-based and programming-aided, it is capable of being much more efficient as a medium of exchange than a Visa card.
Comments like "transactions take place between users directly" really shows how people miss the bill on what BTC actually has the potential to be. \*All currencies involve transactions that take place between users directly\*, this as a statement is not any more important than writing "BTC can be traded for goods and services" as a bullet point. What you're trying to say is that at peak adoption banks don't exist anymore and you don't have to rely on their good faith, making the currency more secure. You can bounce a check but you can't bounce a bitcoin transfer, essentially.
If you want people to fall in love with Bitcoin, don't talk to them about the evils of inflation. They're not real, and most people don't care because the impact is negligible over their lifetime. Instead, talk about the public accountability: about how people can't disguise their illegal expenditures because they're publicly recorded. Talk about how the LN can accommodate thousands of times more transactions per second than Visa can, so their transactions go through faster with fewer difficulties. Tell them about how they can travel to foreign countries or wire money across national borders without paying expensive exchange fees to banks. 
The fixed money supply is a mistake. It was designed to create mining incentive and get the currency off the ground. It will eventually be hard forked out, likely for some other method of introducing BTC, or a secondary fiat layer will be built in on the mechanisms by which BTC is operated with BTC acting as a loose exchange rate and the same counter-market patterns that physical gold has now. Don't shill people on a system neither party fully understands and which could have real long-term consequences.

Prices are usually pretty constant. A large pizza is about $20, while four bananas are $2, so we can say, roughly, that one pizza is worth 80 bananas. That means that if the net worth of BTC at the time was 550 pizzas, it was also about 44,000 bananas.

I told you, I know what Gresham's Law is. The combination of words "Bad money drives out good money" is not a magical statement that makes bitcoin successful because it's deflationary. I am not asking you what the law says. I am asking you where you read/heard/were told that this relates to *deflationary vs. inflationary currencies.* Gresham's Law, almost exclusively, relates to currencies which are treated *equally* as legal tender, but one has an innate value that is greater than its value as a legal tender. I.e., if you use $5 worth of gold to make a $1 coin, no one will use the $1 coin, they'll just sell the gold and use a $1 bill. The direct significance of this is that currencies with no alternative uses tend to drive out currencies with many alternative uses. It does not relate to deflationary vs. inflationary currencies.
Now. **PLEASE**. Tell me who told you that it relates to inflationary vs. deflationary currencies, because as far as I know, it doesn't.

If it's not logical, just show me the economist who says that that's what Gresham's Law states. Seriously, this isn't hard. I'm not saying Bitcoin is shitty, I have over $1000 in BTC, I love BTC. I'm saying Gresham's Law has zero relation to BTC because the principles of Gresham's Law have to do with alternative uses of materials and goods, not perceived values of materials and goods.
If it's so fucking obvious that Gresham's Law means people value deflationary currencies, it should be *incredibly easy* to find economists who use that definition, but *no economist I know of uses that definition*. The fact that no one can show me an example and is just screaming "IT JUST MEANS THAT" is really not making me believe you.

As long as Bitcoin has high liquidity, the price isn't that big a deal. Rather, the price becomes reflective of the amount of transaction traffic moving through Bitcoin. Keep in mind, hodlers do not generate value for the currency because value comes via buying and selling. The value of the currency comes, rather, from its use by retailers as a medium of transaction, then secondarily from its usage as a store of value. Hodlers aren't gamblers either. Hodlers might be what we would think of as a less pessimistic version of a survivalist who keeps gold on hand in case the dollar crashes due to the US government collapsing. The Hodler keeps Bitcoin on hand for the day that Bitcoin's liquidity and ease-of-use is so effective.
Think about a debit card. A debit card has an enormous usage as a medium of transaction, but no usage as a store of value. It's not that the debit card can't store money, it's that you can't know how much money is stored on it unless you have personal access to someone's accounts. If someone asks for $40, you don't give them a debit card with $40 on it, because they don't know for sure that it has $40, and there are better stores of value, like cash or a check. 
Bitcoin, like debit cards, has enormous liquidity. In fact, it has more potential liquidity than debit cards since components like LN could, theoretically, allow for functionally infinite transaction capacities at extremely high rates. It also allows for near-instantaneous transactions between multiple currencies, and far overseas from the branch bank the currency is based out of. It is also more secure, even in the hands of a relatively incompetent or inexperienced user, than a debit card. This will fundamentally drive the usage, while schnorr and Smart Contracts may add other fundamental advantages.
While the price is volatile, this doesn't really affect someone who loads $100 into BTC on a paper wallet and uses it to buy goods on a trip to Quebec, it largely affects Hodlers, who are, for the most part, waiting for 1MM (imperfect peak adoption) to 3MM (perfect peak adoption) BTC anyway. I've been working through this in my head and you're not entirely wrong. Bitcoin does require a fiat layer for stability. Its fundamental use is as a *transaction medium*, not a *currency medium*. That fiat layer may be the result of 2nd layer protocols, a hard fork, or the integration of extant fiat currencies we use today. That does not, however, change the utility of bitcoin as a transaction medium, which is indisputable.
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:31:23
That’s because major contractors still don’t view it as stable enough, but we’re getting there. Think of it as credit cards. It’s taken a while to get credit cards viable for large-scale purchases, even if adoption was almost universal even decades ago. After a certain-sized purchase, checks were just expected, but eventually credit and debit cards have replaced them.
Even if BTC is still also mostly just used as a medium for USD, that doesn’t change its utility as an international medium of exchange that’s secure, rapid, and relatively cheap. The moon is a big goal but it’s a long way off. Be patient.

Lack of faith in Venmo doesn't mean that Venmo-scrip is worth less, it's just debt accounting. That's all this is, it's debt accounting or transference of code. LN uses a different methodology to handle code-transfer than block chain, but that doesn't make it not-BTC in any way, just like Venmo doesn't do debt-accounting in Venmo-scrip, it does it in USD.

The value is generally adaptive to the number of transactions: essentially, to be used as currency for an economy of 21 trillion, bitcoin needs to have a market cap of around 21 trillion, or a value of 1 million/coin.

It would be peculiar for any currency to become that common then just suddenly half the people using it don’t want it anymore.

They can be positive. Bubble expansion indicates a new market, with a lot of innovation and experimentation. Bubble contraction indicates that a previously expanding market is kicking out its unsustainable members to contract down to its best businesses, which will be able to survive the bubble contraction. Artificially inducing a bubble is not necessarily a great idea, since you may make an incorrect judgement of which markets need the most innovation at a given time, but bubbles are not bad by any means. They are disadvantageous to investors who are weak hands and may dump stocks that fall at the collapse of a bubble even if they are good investments.

It's not that it isn't worth shit, it's that it's not backed by the US government. There is nothing you can exchange dollars for from the government, which means they're not backing it. What it means when it's said that "The USD is backed by the US government" is essentially that the government legally enforces the availability of the dollar as a legal tender. In effect, the dollar is an investment commodity with a fairly predictable rate of growth and decline, whose availability as a legal tender is mandated by the US government. This is as opposed to, say, gold, whose availability as a legal tender is solely up to the individual in question.
The value of the USD is not being provided for by the US government, it is being determined arbitrarily by market-wide supply and demand curves, which are dependent on factors like earnings rates, gdp and gdp growth, and interest rates. Strictly speaking this is true for all currencies because "value" is an abstract concept and not a physically-measurable quality. Even if the US implemented the gold standard, the USD would still not be backed by anything. What it would simply mean is that the value of the USD and gold moved in tandem because there was a fixed exchange rate between USD and gold, but the "value" of the USD (and of gold) are still determined arbitrarily at the point-of-exchange.
E.g. a loaf of bread costs $1.00, then deflates to $0.90 due to supply growth. If the currency then simultaneously inflates so that at the end of the year the bread still costs $1.00, it may appear as if, from the perspective of bread, the USD has not lost any value at all. But in comparison an apple may experience no such supply growth, and go from being worth $0.36 to being worth $0.40. From the perspective of an apple, the currency has inflated by a staggering 11%.

Yes he is. The presumption is that wealth is the only source of power, and therefore that society will be improved if the power of the wealthy is restricted. The problem is that to restrict the power of the wealthy, you need to create something more powerful than the wealthy, and there is no guarantee that this does not that turn around and exploit *you*. This is literally what happens in communist dictatorships. The people create a powerful central government to strip the rights of the wealthy, but they don’t realize that power is what’s exploiting them, not wealth. The result is that the powerful central government, when it has removed all opposition, then exploits the peasants that formed it more viciously than even the rich did.

You say that like it’s a fact but it’s not. It’s unsourced propaganda that you’ve been fed to indoctrinate you into an irrational hatred of the wealthy. It’s not backed by anything except your own conviction that it “feels right”. More often than not the countries which have embraced this mentality go on to commit genocide and murder on scales practically impossible to comprehend. Socialist governments in Europe and Asia killed over *100 million people* in the span of 80 years. If you count the nationalist socialists and the casualties in World War Two, that number inflates to almost 200 million. That’s more than the population of all of Western Europe in 80 years.
You’re talking about how “the rich” have been treating the poor like shit as if this is something special. People who have power tend not to care so much about those without power, no matter the mechanism by which this power is obtained. Not to mention that “rich” and “poor” is relative. The poorest person in America is wealthier than the richest person on the island of the Sentinels off the coast of India. You can’t state an absolute condition from a relative condition. There is no physical attribute of wealth which you can point to on a rich person and say “See, this person has wealth”. It’s not like a hare-lip or a large bust, there’s no physical analogue to it. It’s a social condition, which means you consent to the rules which produce it by contributing to that person’s wealth. 
You are posting on reddit, presumably using a computer, in an apartment or house, stocked with food and furniture, and, knowing the audience of reddit, probably also while or after getting a college degree. *You have consented to this system which “treats the poor like shit”*, because there are benefits to living in it compared to living out of it. Poor people are not stupid. They are aware that some guy in the Hamptons doesn’t give a fuck about them. They are also aware that the vast majority of products which they benefit from on a daily basis are produced by the wealthy, and they benefit from access to them, so they choose to participate in the systems in which the wealthy are dominant.

Its behavior hasn't changed at all. It swings wildly in a general upward trend, and usually booms rapidly before crashing. A small number of people pay enough attention or enough money to be able to move their assets appropriately and therefore make a lot of money.

There is an indefinite amount of purchasing power. This is completely unrelated to the money supply. If I discover a gold deposit no one else is aware of, I have not created money, but I have created a source of purchasing power. I have also not taken purchasing power away from anyone else for having done so. Likewise, when someone purchases my goods, I am also not taking away from their purchasing power. This is because the value, in purchasing power, that they perceive from my goods is higher than the value that I perceive and therefore charge. The result is that we *both* benefit from the exchange, because my value for new money is greater than my value for my goods, and their value for my goods is higher than their value for their own money.
When someone discovers something new and sells it, they are creating purchasing power, but they are not creating money. The only *possible* way to define economics as a zero-sum game is if you assume there is some value of purchasing power owned by mother nature, which comprises the possible purchasing power achievable with the most efficient usage of goods. Therefore, someone using goods to produce something would be *taking* purchasing power from nature and moving it into the their own control. However, this still maintains the point that economies within the world of Man are not zero-sum, because they are capable of expanding by taking purchasing power from nature and not from themselves.
Yes, private prisons are not charities. They are prisons. Criticizing them on the basis of their usage of prison labor is ridiculous. Most especially because the ACA (American Correctional Association) legally *requires* prisons to compensate prisoners for their work, to allow them to choose how to work, and requires they always have a job in prison, unless they are enrolled in educational programs. These standards *also* apply to federal prisons. They operate identically, and most of the accusations against them are borderline conspiratorial except in a few cases where the subject was prisoner abuse, and not collusion with the state.
It's an expression. It refers to the person who said "The rich fight the poor" in this immediate context. He's a big boy, he can defend himself, except he's not. He's done nothing to clarify that the statement was not about communism. Instead, other people are basically just giving him the benefit of the doubt and are angry that I have the audacity to point out that "The rich fight the poor" is an endorsement of the Theory of Class-Warfare, which is an explicitly communist theory. It's not a factual statement. This isn't to say that it's false, and *that* isn't to say it's true. The statement is an emotional construction of the statement "The rich appear to benefit from the same factors which negatively influence the poor", which is a personal observation of the person who said it. It is emotionally constructed in a way which is reflective of the Theory of Class-Warfare. It is reflective because this theory posits that the upper classes exploit the lower classes for the sake of enriching themselves, and they do so by purposefully using political and economic tactics to divide and subjugate the poor. In essence, it is an interpretive mechanism which states that the rich benefit from factors in society which harm the poor, and more specifically, **that they do so purposefully in an attempt to subjugate and control the poor**. This is "fighting", which is why it is called "The Theory of Class-**Warfare**" and not "Class-Exploitation" or any other general term.
Now, you can go and tell me that you agree with his statement, that he's right, that the rich do fight the poor, and the poor try to fight the rich but they fail. Just don't pussy-foot around and tell me that this isn't based in the socialist theory which it is so obviously based in that only a moron or a coward could refuse to see it. It isn't "Common Sense" to look at neon flashing lights and claim you don't see the message, it's willful ignorance.

Shutdowns only stop non-necessary government expenses, which includes basically nothing. Even national parks are generally still open, they only closed in the last shutdown because President Obama directly ordered the parks to be closed.

Most of what he says has absolutely nothing to do with inceldom, at all. In fact, the vast majority of material he's produced is just a psychological analysis of why similar religious stories come to exist across all cultures.
It's far more likely that someone who follows Jordan Peterson is an occultist than an incel.

Of course it is. If you scaled the punishment linearly based on the amount stolen then white collar criminals would literally get life in prison for embezzlement. Are you arguing that embezzlement should be punished comparable to murder?

It’s not a knee jerk reaction. “The rich fight the poor” is a statement deeply ingrained in the socialist methodology. It implies that 1) The rich are more powerful than the poor, 2) The rich possess enmity and hatred for the poor, and 3) The rich leverage their power to enact violence upon the poor due to this hatred. That isn’t a statement on power dynamics, that’s an endorsement of the Theory of Class-Warfare. 
This is equivalent to you defending the statement “Everyone should have the same amount of property” as not being communist. It’s blatantly communist. It is an endorsement of a central tenet of communist and Marxist theory. You cannot, in good faith and with a reasonable understanding of the subject matter, *possibly* claim that endorsing major tenets of communist and Marxist theory is not in any way related to communism or Marxism.
EDIT: I had to go back to check this but the fact alone that the user I initially said this to never clarified it wasn’t about communism, but instead everyone *else* has been claiming it’s not about communism, is an enormous indication that it’s related to communism.

You’re not stupid enough to believe that. Whether or not people agree with something has no basis in its reflection of reality. Yelling “That black man tried to kill my daughter” does not hold some basis of truth just because it strikes a chord with my audience of 1860’s southern Democrats

At that point though you’re basically just tallying the number of conservatives and the number of liberals, it just becomes increasingly irrelevant. Not to mention that viewers from CNN are probably also viewers for MSNBC and other liberal cable news networks. There is also no hard and fast rule that older people are more conservative than younger people. In fact most statistics show that Gen Z is significantly more conservative than Millenials or Baby Boomers.
What remains is simply this: Fox News is the highest ranking cable news station. People don’t like MSNBC and CNN, and you can’t change that. Accept it, that’s how things are. Instead of bargaining, just acknowledge that Fox News is the most popular cable news station, and start trying to understand why that’s a difficult fact for you to acknowledge.

The enormous advantage of banking is that a bank can devote its time 100% to making loans while having a large reserve of money to draw on. It gets that large reserve of money by encouraging people to store money in the bank, offering incentives.
I can’t believe it surprises anyone that *charging money to have a savings account* with negative interest rates would result in a reduction or stagnation in savings. This has to be the dumbest idea ever, and it didn’t work, and now they don’t want to switch away from it.

The rich aren’t fighting the poor because access to wealth is not a zero-sum game. The rich do not lose wealth when the poor make money. It is in fact in the best interests of the rich to help the poor, because poor people with skills can be coordinated to make money for the rich while turning a reasonable profit themselves.
Private prisons are not a method of enforcing violence against the poor on behalf of the rich. Private prisons exist because the government refuses to take reasonable actions to curb violence, and as a result the United States endures an extraordinarily high crime rate. It is, however, *illegal* to force inmates to do hard labor, and is considered a form of slavery in the US. Inmates even in private prisons do labor in the form of rehabilitation programs which may have them working food service, doing janitorial work, and stocking libraries. It is intellectually dishonest to evoke the spirit of 80s chain gangs to discuss people ladeling out soup.
Also, my point was not that a thing was about communism because everyone claimed it wasn’t. My point was that a thing was about communism because everyone *except the creator of said thing* said it wasn’t.

Fraudulent bankers frequently go to jail for years for violating the law. What you mean is “Bankers who offered loans to people who couldn’t pay them back”, which isn’t fraud, just unethical.
Common shoplifters get prosecuted and not fined because their victims are not well-to-do upper class rich people who were stupid and just want their money back. Their victims are usually poor underclass ethnic minorities who have put their money on the line trying to get ahead, and may easily lose money on a per diem basis from shoplifting.

You’re scanning the surface and ignoring the content. The rich have power, and desire to retain power. There are other kinds of power which exist, and the people who have that power also desire to retain it. In fact, there will always be people more powerful than others for one reason or another, and they will desire to retain that power.
The concern is not that there are powerful people, the concern is when powerful people use institutions designed to create regularity and stability (the government) to exploit and control the weak.

It’s sounding less like you want to make a point about fairness and more that you’ve been indoctrinated into some absurd pathological hatred of wealthy people.
No one said white collar crime was more prevalent. That’s the problem. You cited an article saying the prosecution rate has gone down but that means nothing about the number of actual crimes. You’re just *angry*, and I don’t know why.

It's almost like the government exists to protect the liberty and livelihood of the people, and not for the people to protect the liberty and livelihood of the government.
