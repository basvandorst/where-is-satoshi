I'm not sure where in the world you can put a $20k car on your debit card, not where I live. The dealership would also notice the gun to your head. 
You are right though, hiding the third key in the bank would work for gun to the head scenario, but it does not protect you from your wallet provider maliciously updating their wallet software to steal your second key and bypass your daily limits. You may trust your wallet provider to not do that, but that's not the kind of risk I want to take with my entire bank account.

I don't understand how you can have "multisig with spending limits" with only your own keys. Spending limits can only be enforced by a third party signer.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:16:01
Hardly seems like a mainstream solution unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:42:17
Your still missing the point. At any time that party can push a malicious update to the wallet software gaining one of your keys. They would then have 2 keys and the ability to sweep your funds. Not secure enough.
Perhaps we need a signing service, one that is a completely seperate entity from the wallet provider. Not perfect but better then trusting your wallet provider to also be your signature.

If we solve problems like I am talking about above, then their won't be much risk. The younger generation hates banks and that hate is growing worldwide. The more they continue to fuck up with things like bailins and other gross incompetence, the more bitcoin strengthens. 
Actually, your point is shit because over half of the world actually does not have banks.

"Get out of Bitcoin then, because it isn't going to happen. You are your own bank. If you can't take that responsibility, then find someone who will take on that responsibility FOR you. (a bank or something like Coinbase.)"
That's a pretty horrible attitude. If bitcoin takes off, more and more people are going to have more and bitcoins, and it is going to be trivial for criminals to start pulling home invasions forcing families to send all of their bitcoins to the attacker. In one night your entire families wealth is wiped out with no way to track down the theif. There has to be a better solution to this rather then giving up control of your money to a third party.

Thank you for adding absolutely nothing of importance. Story of your life I'm assuming.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:04:13
Apologies, I wasn't sure who/how to do that. I thought the point of my thread was being misconstrued due to the first reply I got.
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:13:29
Also not anywhere near a mainstream level solution.
And with those solutions were back to having someone who knows you keep your life savings in bitcoin can hold you at gunpoint until you send the funds. We're just going around in circles here.

That's really relative isn't it? If I only have $10,000 to my name, then that is a lot of money to me! Doesn't mean I should have to be an expert to secure and go out of my way with complicated computer stuff in order to feel safe.

If someone knows you have all your money in bitcoin, and you only are able to choke up 2 btc. They're gonna know you are lying.
Wallet software will multisig will always be at risk of silent update by the wallet operator. It also forces you to have to rely on that third party not going down for any amount of time.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:21:58
These are obviously limits that you set for yourself. What you feel comfortable with, not set by a third party. If you know that you'll need more money soon, to buy a house for example, then there should be a tx you can send that will allow you up your limits after x amount of days. How often do you need access to spend all of your money on short notice? If it happens to be often for you then you don't need to use the feature.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:45:59
Nobody keeps all their money in cash. Bitcoin is not meant to be the same thing.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:03:19
The point of my story is that there should be a algorithmic and trustless way to protect your bitcoin from being wiped out overnight for any reason. I'm sure it's possible, eventually we'll get there.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:41:05
That would require you to go to a bank and get the money, then go to a dealership and buy the car. Both would be unable to occur with a gun to your head. Instead, sneaking into a house and threatening a family to send you all their money and then dissapearing into the night is absolutely trivial in comparison.
You are also not safe from a multisig wallet service maliciously and silently updating their software to steal your key. I would not trust all my money to such a scenario either.
We need a trustless way to ensure that you cannot be wiped out overnight.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:15:13
well please tell me how?? I'd love to take advantage of this user friendly solution you have that doesn't involve splitting up keys using advanced cryptography and handing them out to family member and basically making most of your money very difficult to access.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:11:28
Whatever man, it's clear you are definitely not the type of person that helps push the world forward. You exist solely to slow us down. Spending your Sunday badgering a stranger on the internet for an interest of theirs. I feel sorry for you.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:20:22
Well it's certainly got you all riled up for some reason! Pretty sure people said the same thing about the car, electricity, the airplane, the internet etc...

You speak like the code is set in stone forever and is incapable of changing or evolving in the future. I too am shocked the perfect system was not created on day 1.
Real visionary thinker we have here ladies and gentlemen.
