Yes, it could be scary and yes and no on the other. Why? The forbidding will be early stages and no because of global demand of a currency that does not depreciate. In the USA the fed is scrambling to appoint members of a newly formed digital currency commission. Doesn't look to me like they're thinking anywhere near short term. As for myself, I'm in a hardware wallet and it's been forgotten for about 10 years. It's gonna be fun!

Sure it does but that doesn't mean the governmental regulatory commissions and banks are not going to have a heavy hand in things. Think of it like this. Governments are not getting their cut (taxes via gains) and they will do what they have to get their cut or they'll eventually make things illegal through legislative process. Insofar as the banks...who side do you think they're gonna take? Good luck

This does not bode well for investors in legitimate cryptos in 2018. The faretting out of the illigitimate ICO's and exchanges, ripoffs and scams in this apparently very strange world of digital currency can be a good thing if investors were to drop the FUD factor, the greed, grow some brains and common sense, get over the get rich quick logic,    and most importantly; let the regulatory commissions around the world do what most certainly has to be done. All of course,  in the effort to make cryptos a viable, legal and legitimate currency. Patience is a virtue!
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:23:01
It's gonna be a wild ride though 2018 while financial establishment around the world weed out the scammers, ICO pipe dreams, and greedy investors bent on getting rich quick without a trace. Ferret out the negatives throughout, allow the regulatory commision(s) to do what they will do; and then sit back, relax and enjoy seeing legitimate crypto portfolio's grow beyond our wildest dreams! Chill!

My editing didn't change the premise, aside from different choice of words , adding to or restructure of a sentence to get the same point across. If you don't think Bezos is not now  in it for the money and notoriety of it, just ask the wealthiest individual the world. Money controls everything those people say and do, and yes \- they do want their names etched in stone, in the history books and at the top. I don't think I implied Bitcoin would take over credit cards. Quite to the contrary; I believe credit cards as part of financial institutions will someday own the greatest market share of Bitcoin for all it's worth. No worries bud...everyone's entitled to their opinion.

When you write that passphrase down, transpose 2 of the words written down. For example: 12 and 20. You don't have to remember the word, just the 2 numbers you transposed. Remember the 2 numbers and don't write them down anywhere. This way, even if a scumbag get's their hands on your passphrase, they're not getting in. That is, if they're not a Lopht graduate. Downside of it....if you're rendered brain dead through an accident or whatever, Oh well! Seriously, what I've done is cryo'd one of the transposed numbers through one company, another transposed number to another company and the seedphrase w/two transposed words with a third company; and have put instructions in a will. Yep, no one but the possible disgruntled Ledger programmer is going to steal my goods. If you do this, make those two numbers something you'll never forget. Also, don't get ingenius or inventive by transposing 4 or 6 numbers. Best laid plans, right?

Big name credit card companies are holding this down too. When they approve, all hell breaks loose toward setting some real crypto\-based spending. Bezos is getting there; just being careful for now, considering all of the implications. Laying the groundwork for such an undertaking can't be easy. Even for the almighty Amazon or Walmart. I can't imagine him not going there because doing so would etch his name permanently in the financial history books. And besides \- I would bet dollars to donuts, he doesn't want Walmart going there first.

Just what I thought. SOS. Same ole pumps, same ole dumps, same old scams - a lot less idiots dressed in space suits readying for the next moon shot though. A lot less kiddies blabbering about Lambo's too. Looks like the reality of how the evolving of transacting digitally; to supplant transacting with paper as the world knows it takes a very long time has finally baked into more brains than not. Think I'll check out again now, but not for 2 months. This time - a couple years; and that may not be long enough. In any event, put it in the offline wallet folks and forget it for awhile. You may someday be happy you did. In other words; Grasp what is real, save the brain cells for far more important things and save the wasted Internet bandwidth for when it may really need it. Peace out!

That ideological concept, the Satoshi premise seems to be turning everywhere we look in crypto these days. Especially when regulators are concerned about it.

Plausible theory there. Long as you're not one of those conspiracy theory loony's, pushing only what you've heard and not what you've researched. Makes perfect sense. Have seen that spin on it here and there. Someone had to get it to market \- what better way than a government entity to do it? As for myself, I could care less about where it came from. Does any of the origin of it really matter now, beyond what to put in the history books or possibly finding one of its inventors to assist in the digging into it, fine tuning it, fixing its imperfections? I think those may be what matter's most. That is, if it is to continue gaining credibility. as opposed to the 3 steps forward, 4 steps back scenario we're seeing recently; with an occasional 2 steps back, 4 or 5 steps forward in the mix.

You paint a very scary picture for the future of crypto then, if regulators are to have their way with that. Not to say your opinion lacks common sense. Your observation is very true and one large aspect of the trade\-based manipulation going on. My opinion is from a common investor\-sense aspect of things; in knowing investors are driven by fear and greed, with the two greatest factors driving those are news and sentiment. I think we're talking about apples and oranges here. Insofar as fake trades go  \-Tell that to those buying BTC on an exchange that accepts USD deposits and withdrawals, move it over to another exchange that doesn't, buy a alt/BTC pair, trade it, make profit, turn it into BTC via USDT, move it back over to the first exchange, sell it for USD and then withdraw that to a bank. The aforementioned may someday be illegal but for now, none of the that looks fake to me. I guess we can therefore agree with all \(including your assessment\) \- is why regulators will do what they do. "Turn it into BTC via USDT" you may ask? There is apparently a tax loophole there that is sure to get closed before the end of this year. I would bet on it! Respectfully.

* I bought mine on Amazon, was a 2 week delay from a third party. No way was I about to go with what Ledger says about attestation and safety on it of the box. I popped the hood on it to verify there was no companion chip and the authenticity of the main chip. Had to be very careful popping it open though. There is a very specific way to do it without dislodging pieces fitting inside like somewhat of puzzle. Most important is keeping it flat on a table when one does pop it open.  I couldn't find a how to on youtube on it...had to drill into Google and found a great step by step with explanation and pics. Better than the blurb and pic Ledger has on it on their web site. For the guy that got his delivered from Ledger. If the shipping box had the word Ledger anywhere on it, pop the hood! If not, you're probably good to go. As for myself, I would pop the hood so I can sleep nights. You'd be surprised at the repacking, labeling, every little detail a slimebag Ledger thieve is capable of to make it and shipping materials look untampered with. Also, don't let the Ledger disclaimer about voiding the warranty scare either. It's easy to do without leaving a mark if one uses a thin jeweler's flat head. There are no internals that would let on that the hood was popped.  And on a final note to all you proud Nano S owners out there. Hate to be the bearer of a seriously fucked up possibility here but....
* What if Ledger or a programmer there left a back\-door open to some day...some very later day; go in and nab the goods through that hard coded passphrase? Sorry guys, I know that's fucked up. Moral to that scenario is "truth is sometimes stranger than fiction". Good luck to all!

I was trying to put it in the perspective of its market cap being near 1/3 of overall loss during this year. Easier to see the positive impact of it's removal that way.

I agree with you 100&amp; Mine was not from a position of apathy or an accepting of the delay of segwit becoming the standard, as was more from the aspect of helping others to understand the possibilities and why the delay. I am sure you are aware of the "big plates" the exchanges and other crypto\-based entities have before them these days.

Net neutrality on crypto?...on the Internet? Fat chance of that ever happening, respectfully. IMHO the selloff was due to sentiment affected by the attention and subsequent "bad press" it was garnering through governments and regulators.
Not sure the same is the reason for this selloff. Sentiment is a major factor with investing \- nothing has changed with the governments and regulators. If anything, they've loosened their grip on a lot of it, and gotten away from the all\-inclusive or none theory. Thus opening doors while tightening that grip on the lesser, the easier regulative aspects of it. Silly as it may sound \- if I was a fly on wall looking out, I'd say Munger, Buffet and Gates, with their round table on the crypto\-space last weekend had more to do with sentiment and the selloff this time than most people want to give credit to or disdain for. To me, it was no more than opinion with conjecture. These guys know their influence and they know it well! Too bad they may not know what their talking about insofar as crypto\-economic benefit\(s\) are concerned. They have no crystal ball \- maybe ball's they carry in burlap bags. They have none other than their influence to try and sway a growing interest away while they learn all about crypto, and you can bet the house that they're trying to do exactly that. Scary stuff!

Lower fees and faster transactions are only part of the segwit picture. There are contributing factors that have discouraged exchanges, developers and miners from transitioning to it.   \- There are vulnerabilities in the code leaving the exchanges open to DNS hacks. They can protect themselves from the hack, but do they really want to since they don't have to?  \-  Multiple thousands of lines of code have to be written to support it. Does anyone have the time or want to spend the money for that when again, they really don't have to?  \- Miners have to rev up or upgrade the hardware to support it. It's all about money there and again, do they really have to? The answer for all three is a resounding "No", as long as legacy is there to make the transaction happen. At least not until there is a mandate of sorts. I understand there is one in the works. I'm not making excuses or saying segwit is not good for the investor. The problem is, it's not good for all, and since the exchanges, devs and miners have us dead\-to\-rights insofar as weighing the pro's and con's with regard to risk, productivity and profitability \-  I'll let you fill in the blanks about how soon we might be seeing segwit as the defacto standard for transacting Bitcoin.

# This is not market manipulation. This is people holding back now (world wide) during all of the regulatory news during the last three mos.. Not a bad thing and bodes well for the future of bitcoin. These people (not you?) reacting to weekly market moves need to chill on the get rich quick theory. They are holding things back by giving some regulators the ammo they need to put the nix to all of it. Stupid and sad part of that is...these people don't even know that their contributing more to the demise of crypto than to the success of it. In other words...de-fuel the spaceships. Put 'em in cold storage, hang up the spacesuit's and forget the Lambo's for awhile too. That was the mean way to put things. Nice way to put it is: Be patient and watch the regulatory news daily, and bad thing again - grow some shit between the ears!

Oh that's right. Excuse me for actually keeping it simple and not complicating things with talk of blockchain technicalities and principles of investing. Simple logic may apply now in a crumbling crypto-space; and without all of the complex explanations for the feint of heart and those lacking between the ears to get even more lost in.  Something tells me, no matter what someone has to offer, you would counter it with useless words. For sake of keeping things simple ....FO

Nothing actually. Love em. Think of mine here as a perfect labeling of crypto nowadays. I think of the smiles clowns have brought to the faces of literally multiples of millions of children over the years; not to mention the adults. Especially those needing a good laugh after the "great depression", or to lift the spirits. Clowns...a great way to put despair or sadness on hold and bring out the good in people. Maybe I am one too. Hope so. Just imagine the costumes and the laughs if there was a crypto theme'd parade of clowns. Sure would have me rolling in the aisles.

Better put those Lambo's and space ships on hold folks, and hold on to your hats. We may see 2000 by the end of summer at SEC headquarters. Some people think what the USA says or does, does not affect global sentiment and price. BS, you're looking at that effect. Bottom line: Other countries certainly do mimic USA monetary policy. Don't believe it? Read world news. Okay, throw several mil peeps that are tired of the slimebag scammers coming out of the wood works in there too, as being a large part of the reason for the decline. The thieving assholes of the world are in dire need of some instant charma. If it doesn't happen, global regs will see that it does; in some form or another. I feel for the millions of people that got burned on dreams over nothing more than hype. I feel a lot less for those that got burned; parading around in their e-clown costumes, with rockets strapped to their backs - moon or bust  printed on them during the charade. Oh well, clowns will be clowns...hard lessons learned. And for God sakes people, don't sell it if you believe crypto will make a comeback in lets say.... 10, maybe 30 years. GLTA, except to those assholes that also fucked up a good thing while forgetting charma pounces when one least expects it!
edit: for the trolls out there...no, I didn't get burned. I picked up some BTC last August, threw it in a cold wallet and it's been forgotten ever since. I did not buy what I was not prepared to loose. Common sense, if you will -  about a 10-12 year old digital currency technology intended to supplant existing monetary systems that took hundreds, if not thousands of years to evolve.

Just read it. Interesting. Not worried...yet. Intent will likely be key to litigating the validity of blockchain content.

Check your chart dude. 2 double bottoms. One on each MA and a classic cup and handle late jan to mid feb.. It tried after that but the fear factor won out. I would say, so much for using chart analysis for crypto's while the regulators are having their way with things. The entire market is being manipulated big time. If you don't believe that, check the news feeds right around the day - the top right of that cup. I'm not selling and am in my Nano S until this crap gets hammered out.

Anyone wondering what is happening to crypto these last 4-months, read this:
Not saying I agree that  - that is what will happen. I do believe it will happen if an industry continues an apparent inability to reign in the shiesters, scam artists, fake and investors believing they're going to get something for nothing. Transacting digitally on a global scale certainly  will happen; it might not happen how Satoshi envisioned it.
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:27:31
It does not follow Bitcoin. If it did, it would bottom. It will in fact, correct this week, but only due to fears of a Fed interest hike mid week and G20 where other nations will use it as a sounding board to counter the steel/alum tariffs. Get real and go buy more tokens. Just think of how you'll be able to pull that bag full of em out and say, "See, I got some?" when the name "crypto" comes up in a game of Trivial Pursuit.

Bear trap is a false move down beyond support levels when volume does not match the move. Bull trap is same theory but when the false move up beyond resistance levels is not paired with increased volume. Key are the volume's. Not all people will agree. I use trade volume indicators to ID bull traps; stock volume indicators to ID bear traps. Be careful using them because they send very different signals. Also note: bears tend to short using large numbers of shares or coin to set the trap, thus making them easy to spot when I look at stock volume indicators. I don't short, so I am no master at it and only look at bottoms to see where I think a good re-entry point may lay. Bull traps, on the other side of it are far more important to me. If the trade volume(the number of trades) does not jive with the rising price, I sell and wait for a bear trend to make it's next bull move up. Carefully watching for that bear trap signal I spoke of above before buying back in. Back to the upside here - If I see no bull trap, I ride it up until I do see it, then sell. Whales and tutes are big factors too, so watch for them. Simply - what I do is rinse, repeat. Because I swing trade and not day trade for quick accumulative profit, I don't have to set stops as long as I watch closely 3-4 times a week. It works for me. I suppose if I set stops I could make a lot more money, but I do okay. I sleep nights and have fun while doing it. Also, none of the above applies to my coinage and is all about stocks. I tucked several K in total worth of 8 different high market capitalized and exchange popular coins (2 of them stablecoin's), diversified you might call it; away in a hw wallet last August and maybe, or these days - I hope my grand children will some day be wealthy beyond their wildest dreams over it. Also hope I've given you a good basics on identifying bull and bear traps. Good luck!

Or maybe it's the dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with BS logic that really does apply to all here. Saddest part of all is, I wonder how many peeps will be reading up on it after reading this - and throwing their money down before the 14th.

If you transacted as you've successfully transacted to the same address before (segwit to segwit), then there must be a different problem. I wouldn't overthink this. I also wouldn't worry about having been scammed with 0 confirmations. YET. For a sec there, I was thinking you were phished. Dude, if it's not something I am unaware of, its in that segwit addressing. That is the least common denominator. Being "Pretty sure" the receiving had segwit enabled is not conclusive. Make sure! Also make sure that receiving address is not going to scam you after attempting to resend. If you do not know the receiver, I definitely would not change the config on your end to accommodate their end. Since you hold what the receiver wants (the goods), make them accommodate you. If they don't, no worries, the transaction will eventually time out and can do it later; after everyone's ducks are in a row. Would be interested in knowing how this worked out for you. Also, open a ticket with Coinomi. They may go right to it. As for myself; after all things considered - if I have to jump through hoops to make it work or smells fishy, I would walk away from it. Good luck

Not necessary. I think the second one is used to backup the seedphrase of the first one. Thus, not having to write it down. Not a bad idea and I don't know how its done. I have one Ledger Nano S; seedphrase safely put away. If you don't mind one more bit of advice. If you go the route of writing down your seedphrase, transpose 2 of the words written down. That way if your seedphrase falls into shady hands, odds are they'll never crack it. Just don't forget what you transposed and no, don't write or store what you transposed anywhere.

umm eerrrr, they've been blown out of the water? Seriously, they have. Torrent is a great example. The premise years ago was to develop ways to digitally transact monetary assets. That did not work, thus we have what Torrent is today. BTW: Those developers are working on coin initiatives. Actually there are few coins out already that were developed by Torrent team members. Prolly good ones to keep a close eye on. I wouldn't be surprised if someday it came out that Satoshi (the person or team) was somehow Torrent connected back in the day. I would also go far to say, if Satoshi does some day surface, it may be under the name or guise, have you; of a stablecoin.

Move it to a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet. The investment in one is worth being able to sleep nights. Move it back into the exchanges when you want to trade or cash out. Insofar as all of those other wallet types, out there, nothing beats the more simple to do and security of a Nano S or Trezor. Know going in: if you trade ERC20 tokens, you can't see or manage them on the hardware wallet if its not on the wallet compatibility list. From there- people use MEW or MetaMask to do that. I use my Nano S with MEW. MEW is a little sketchy, but it works if I'm careful. Very careful! Also, nothing beats Coinbase for cashing out. Others will say, yea, but what about their fee's. I say, fee's - schmee's. Gonna have to pay everywhere; so what if they're a little higher on the almighty and much more secure and USD insured Coinbase. All IMHO

This is my assessment based on world markets.  No, I do not believe the average investor or buyer are concerned of a trade war. Thus, holding cash or keeping it in the bank. The bank? That, my friend I would be glad to discuss on another day. 
My correlation of Bitcoin or Crypto to other world markets has more to do with why it is people invest in commodity's, security's and currency's. I believe the basis of investing are key and that the components; psychological or otherwise that drive investors toward the fear and greed felt by them(us) are news and sentiment; among others and are same across all asset classes - With crypto being just another asset class. Crypto  declared to be a asset, commodity or currency; on another day, as well. Your assertion of BTC being a deflationary investment vehicle not withstanding, and will be addressed below.
One has to look no further than FOREX, CME, The Dow, NIKKEI, DAX, Hang Seng, Bolsa, FTSE and countless others; even Swiss markets to see the recent down-trend. Surely this is no coincidence, and must be accountable to something. Trade war fears do seem to be the one common denominator. Does Crypto really not appear to be experiencing the same? It surely cannot only be attributable to regulatory issues, or people finally wising up to it; though I do believe those to be other driving force(s) when considering the longer, the four month correction.
I do see how crypto could now fit into that deflationary role but I am not so sure that is how Satoshi intended it. Who really knows; and may have to be figured out between those that determine, or approve of it being a asset, commodity or currency. In any event, any form of re-writing, even a facsimile of it; would be devastating for umm, err - you know who. 
Insofar as the average investor understanding deflationary investment vehicles, appreciation/depreciation gaps, world banking, or what the intricacies of investing for monetary gain are; I agree with you; most investors do not understand, international economics. What they do understand (kind of), are the aforementioned components that drive them.
And look at that - America wakes up this morning and it's already down 3.6% Go figure. IMHO, and I respectfully remain.

I hear you. They have to get the passphrase first before they can crack the transposition, right? Seems you have a background in IT. Seems you might have an answer for everything too. If the former, we both know I didn't just pull the idea out of a hat. We also know Lopht could crack just about anything if they put their minds to it. Key is to not make it worth their time and effort when, after all - look at all the easy pick'ins out there. Key, are also ways I might be able to help people by giving them a basis, things to think about. Not do. I'm just trying to help people, so lighten up dude. Transposing is not useless; especially when it isn't just another stereotyped nerd that is trying to defeat the Lopht logic; doing the transposing, among other things. Edit: If you're not the real nerd here, tell me the difference(s) between a hacker, cracker and phreaker without Google'ing it! And no, a phreaker in this sense is not someone that runs naked across the playing field.

Read the article! 
New York is investigating - they or the US is not shutting any one exchange down any time soon. Due process would give anybody with any sense at all; plenty of warning as to when to hook up the horses and get out of Dodge. That is, if one were to carefully follow progression of the investigation and possible subsequent case. The way I see it, the investigation could not happen at a better time. I, for one do want to know if crypto lacks government and regulator backing before I continue putting my hard earned cash into it. Anyone that believes they're not going to have their way with an industry premised upon anonymity and filled with scams and the unscrupulous, whether anyone likes it or not, truly is living the dream. Since the exchanges are not anonymous, it looks like they start there. Your "GTFO of Coinbase right now" and "If" is irrational FUD bud.

After reading this reply of your's, I don't feel so bad about calling you out on your reply below. You, my young friend have no clue of what you're talking about. BTC invested = 0 USD huh? I'd like to see you run that line by Coinbase.

I think all of you will be very happy campers in 2 years. Might be a lot of chicken on that bone. I like the contract premise. Hope you set up a trust and assigned an executor.  That way, no one investor can breach the agreement. 42 investors could make things difficult to keep a simple experiment intact. Maybe need an attorney to set it all up, maybe a partnership as opposed to a trust. Good luck.

Ok, let's see if I got this right. You buy as it's going down at 6800, 6750 and 6700 etc; hypothetically and set each block to stop 3-5% above your buy price. Understood. What do you do if it continues going down? Eventually you're going to run out of money to keep buying. So let's for giggles say you've bought 20 blocks, with the last block being the least expensive (considering SP/coin price) and the market starts to trend up afterward. Seems to me you're willing to let your investment into each block ride until the market hits your strike price. If it doesn't, you may be waiting a long time or maybe you just have that kind of cash to let it ride. I think most of us do not and that strategy seems awfully risky. Also understood, you can cancel the original strike price and set a lower strike price, but if you do - you've lost money; and that my friend why they say rule number 1, 3, 10 or 300, whatever; never average down when investing - especially in volatile markets like crypto has been.

Totally agree! It's amazing how hindsight is always 20/20. That's why I don't get how peeps reading candles and analyzing trend lines beyond a day maybe two back continue to get away selling their BS on youtube. Damn those peeps that invented those two words "support" and "resistance". Imagine the possibilities had some greedy clowns not tried to analyze it all. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:38:01
Nice video. Funny. Too bad it's not reality. The biggest difference between crypto of early December and now are the regulators having taken hold of it during the last few months. Got some good news and some bad news for all. The good news is: If it can continue gains during the next year or two, with much more regulation to come - maybe there is hope for the technology of it to some day supplant paper currency as we know it. Unfortunately, the bad news is: Won't be any "moon shots" ever. That is, if peeps keep their common sense intact and heads securely fastened. And those fucking scumbag scammers... They have got to fucking go!
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:58:39
And what makes you believe they're ever going be done? Thus, the spikes. These whales are pro's. They're not going to ever be done. They are the only ones that average down and still make significant profit off those that see the spike, and buy on it. I believe key are the stops. Set them at a greater margin yielding less profit but profit nonetheless, while the whales continue to play. Makes them work a little harder.
@_date: 2018-04-10 04:23:03

@_date: 2018-04-05 05:23:45
Thanks for posting a more realistic approach to simple logic. I agree. Though I believe crypto will someday explode to the upside after news catalyst indicating global-wide adoption - that's not happening for a very long time. Sure, there will be spikes in there, and the naysaying kiddies to say, "See?, told ya so. Told you it was gonna go to the moon?" I suppose we'll be able to thank them for keeping it alive while waiting for that moon shot. Yes, the industry is exciting. It is fantastically exciting! And no, it's not anywhere near where it will be in 20,30-50 years. Save it for the grandchildren and great-grandchildren folks. Exactly where it belongs. I agree, the industry will be sideways for the next couple of years. So buy and do not HODL. Buy and hold for when the world uses it as currency of choice.

Thar she blows mates. Just broke resistance. Not sure what all of this really means. Another trend being challenged is: When Europe and Asia wake up, it usually rebounds.

So glad I thought there was a 'lil ole skunk in the woodpile when I wouldn't buy from 10 up to 19. That old cliche sure does ring true now. If it sounds to good to be true, it isn't. Now I'm stuck waiting for 10 and then I'm outa here and back to the safety of stocks; where the short term candles are way easier to read and deliver. Wow, never thought I'd be thinking stocks were safe against anything. Goes to show just how phucked up this industry really is!

Save the oxygen and bandwidth -no reply necessary.
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:04:34
ShortyTheBearTrader said it best below. To take that a few steps further, I believe it is because of disinterest due to regulatory issues and definitely trade war fears playing into it now. Also, people have been watching sideways and down trends for months; since all the hype during the last half of last year. So much for hype! IMHO - this market doesn't really turn until regulators have their way with it (and they WILL have their way with it), the "to the moon" mentality subsides and trade agreements are met. The way I see it, ALL of crypto is sideways, and trending up through the USA fall season. A cleaning out of scared money, if you will. Not a bad thing. Sure, there have been and will continue to be FOMO spikes and FUD dips along the way, but nothing significant to come. That is, if global adoption is not eminent or if a war break's out. My careful analysis shows (no, not a crystal ball) crypto's sideways trending slightly up for at least 6 months. What better time to buy what you research and believe in now, lock it down in a hardware wallet and wait while enjoying the summer? For me, none. Remember folks - be nice, just IMHO. Remember this too...LOCK THAT SHIT DOWN because the industry is thick with thieves just waiting for you to lapse in judgement or make a mistake...that includes some exchanges.

Segwit was intended to be the cure-all to lower fees and faster speeds. On the surface, that is. Those two variables are only part of the segwit picture. There are many other variables that the miners, devs and exchanges don't like about it. Those being, miners forced to upgrade hardware, developers to re-write API's and there are new vulnerbility's contained within for hacks the exchanges can do without. Also, Segwit presented complexity far beyond what Satoshi intended. I suppose the professionals that know the technology best are saying, who needs it if just the end user, the investor benefits in small increments over it. All variables considered; I for one, have to agree. "If it don't need fixing, don't fix it".

Can be. That is why only transpose 2 of them. Don't have to remember the words, just have to remember the number of the words in the list. For example: words 12 and 13 are transposed. How hard is that to remember? Here is the downside to the logic...what if one was rendered brain dead, an accident or something? Oh well! As for myself, I have no problem with it. My Ledger endowment is in a will and I am seriously considering separate cryogenic storage of the seed and numbers transposed with three separate company's. No shit. Seedphrase with one, 2 separate numbers with two others. And here, my goal was to keep it simple. Simple is next to impossible in this industry.

That guy with the trading view chart has several predictions on youtube. He is telling us what we already know. And imagine that - he's probably making more money on youtube than in coinage. Good for him, and bad for us for falling for it. And that is pretty much what charts do; they tell us what we know. Accurate chart predicting of where a market might go should go no further back than a day or two - a week max; with other factors in the mix. Now, if he had a crystal ball....don't blame me - I'm just making this shit up too.

May as well get used to it folks. Just about everything is sideways, and possibly worse until trade war fears are settled; and the tariff's don't even start until early October.

Tether schmether...if the music stops on it, anyone holding is severely screwed. Just MHO of it. Stock market sure is taking a beating lately. I think once the tech sector recovers, the others will follow suit if bonds don't respond to interest rate hike's. US banning crypto...now there's a scare. Could happen but if it were to happen, all would know of it coming, in advance. Wars schmwars too...I don't even want to go there. Respecfully dude.
