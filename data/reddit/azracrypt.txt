Blockchain technology and smart contracts gained attention with the introduction of the Bitcoin, the first and most established cryptocurrency so far. Other than the application of cryptocurrency, Blockchain has evolved and its use cases are coming forward in different industries.

I'm proud of what you did before and if this scenario would ever going to happen in this time let us still be kind and give it back to the owner regardless of how much it is.

Perhaps surprisingly, all of these limitations of smart contracts are widely recognized by those advocates and critics alike. No one denies these issues exist, whilst no one also denies that others may try to create solutions. There are these projects of today which do have the architecture that can circumvent all of the limitations of smart contract as described. Try searching Komodo as an example. It may take time for things to really flourish, but as the overall industry tries to take effect on its interesting opportunity, there's no doubt a flawless utilization of it will probably happen.

Smart contracts are stored in the distributed registry as a one time written code. They carry out their work thanks to a computer network which controls the blockchain. Thus, if a code is written in a proper way, nobody will be able to change it.

Trust — Blockchain helps in creating applications that are decentralized and collectively owned by multiple people. No body within this group has the power to change or delete previous transactions. Even if someone tries to do so, it will not be accepted by other stakeholders.
