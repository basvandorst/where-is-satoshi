@_date: 2015-06-25 14:11:29
still its not that easy , but what not many people know is one of the ten challenges is a jackpot challenge with an extra 50 bitcoins reward attached to it....so it could or could not be the polar bear one.....but it might very well be coming up with ten cool challenges one---no ten!!! that one is fairly easy after all
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:29:35
hey thats a funny picture but I mean an actual real photograph....but it made me think of another challenge....the best photoshopped image posted in the thread in the next 60 days with caption will receive .5 bitcoin....so far you are ahead at least....this will be decided by Me.

I'm crowdfunding it , imagine if bitcoin became a worldwide currency everyone would save money!! Surely bitcoin enthusiasts will see this race as great marketing for the product
@_date: 2015-08-17 22:11:49
Dont you think bitcoin would benefit from a bitcoin round the world race with a million dollar first prize that would catch the imagination of the world and thus promote bitcoin as a viable money alternative to the Massess????!!!!!!!
