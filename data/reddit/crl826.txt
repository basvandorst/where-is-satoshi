Some businesses will support it because they support the theory/philosophy of cryptocurrency. Others will support it because they know they will get some PR and SEO.
All the while, usability will continue to improve. If enough people are using crypto, market forces will force adoption.

WIKIPEDIA definition - In marketing terminology, a killer application (commonly shortened to killer app) is any computer program that is so necessary or desirable that it proves the core value of some larger technology, such as computer hardware, gaming console, software, a programming language, software platform, or an operating system. In other words, consumers would buy the (usually expensive) hardware just to run that application. A killer app can substantially increase sales of the platform on which it runs.
Now me talking - Sorry, just don't believe most people are looking for a way to pay for otherwise free internet content.
I'll grant bitcoin makes this possible more so than fiat, but still isn't going to inspire regular joe to get some bitcoin so he can tip podcasters.
Therefore...not actually a killer app.

Not good.  We hit a technical snag and, quite frankly, we couldn't get a lot of interest in the project.  I'm sure some of it was people not wanting to risk signing up for something fake, but we expected more interest than we got.
Also, with Gyft now accepting Bitcoins, I am not really sure what value we can add to the Bitcoin world.  A running tally of people using Bitcoin to buy things on Amazon is not much of a product differentiation.
I'm disappointed but it just doesn't seem like it was meant to be.

@_date: 2013-09-03 17:37:23
This also assumes everywhere has the same rules. Unless there is a simultaneous banning everywhere at the same time BTC will continue to mature.

@_date: 2013-03-14 04:23:19
Hi everyone.  I am half of the partnership that came up with this plan to make it easier to spend Bitcoins.
Our hope is that by making it easy to spend Bitcoins on Amazon that a lot of money will be spent on Amazon.
We will show the total amount of orders and money that we have processed on our homepage and eventually (we hope) Amazon won't be able to ignore Bitcoin.
And if Amazon starts accepting Bitcoins, I think we will have entered a whole new chapter of the story of Bitcoin.
So if this is something you agree with, it would be great if you could show your support by registering.  The greater the response the harder I can push the developer to speed up :)
@_date: 2013-03-14 16:19:14
Also, on the business model front....we know we aren't breaking new ground there, but I do think zero fees is a pretty good differentiator.  And I think the explicit efforts to use the site to show Amazon that Bitcoin is something they should accept is something I haven't seen before.
Again, hope you see the value here in a couple weeks :)
@_date: 2013-03-14 05:55:26
I suppose that is fair.  
I would ask you to compare us to a site like Bitspend.net or pizzaforcoins.com that charges a fee on top of whatever merchant they are acting as a middleman for.
Our intent is to be the cheapest, easiest way to order things online until such time that Bitcoin is accepted everywhere.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:05:37
They do lose 1% converting it to dollars

@_date: 2013-04-15 00:35:44
The most likely company to use Bitcoin is one that has one of these two items
*has transaction fees as a large portion of its costs or
*Anonymity preferred by buyer and seller
Both is even better.  I think we will make a lot more progress when we convince companies it is in their interest to adopt Bitcoin.  
Not try and convince them that accepting Bitcoin is in  Bitcoin's best interest (which is what we seem to focus on)

Yeah we plan to use affiliate links.  I love the idea of Amazon fronting the cost of the plan. :)
As I mention in my [previous comment]( this is ultimately about showing Amazon that Bitcoin is a real currency with real business value.  We expect that eventually Amazon will step in and cut us out of the loop.  
In the meantime, we plan to spend the affiliate money on developer time to make the site even easier to use.
If we run out of ideas to do that and Amazon still hasn't added Bitcoin, then maybe we put that in our pocket.  Or maybe we offer an automatic discount.  We'll worry about that when we get there :)
@_date: 2013-03-14 16:30:11

Nope.  The plan is to be live in 2-3 weeks.  We just wanted to gauge interest and start answering questions now so we could hit the ground running.

Thats not how I read it.

At the federal level - 2% on education.  Prison spending is so low it doesnt even get broken out beyond 'All Other' (which is only 5%)

I didn't expect it would convince everyone.  I definitely understand it is on us to cultivate trust. And we certainly intend on having trustworthy people do write ups for us as soon as we have the actual product finished.
All that being said, I am here answering answering questions about trust and the site.  I do think 6 years means something because it would be pretty difficult for a scammer to fake that.  Anyone could open a reddit account and answer questions for a night though.
Either way, I hope you sign up and/or use us in the future.
