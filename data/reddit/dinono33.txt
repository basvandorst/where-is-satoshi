I couldnt careless and I am still thinking we going to hit 50k or a 100k this year. Bullish for long term. Too many hands involved that would love to see this bitcoin thing go astronomical.

@_date: 2019-07-01 13:47:37
Love the positivity, however Baakt has been playing games. I dont trust them one bit and they have lost alot of credibility from the community.

Bla bla bla. Instutitional money is coming... its been coming for 9 months and not a single drop of money into buying crypto. Just retail buys and short squuezes.

Love it! Would love to own one!
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:23:18
OTC is unreliable since there is barely any records in the blockchain. Article states billions were transfered from a whale. If that was true it would show on the block chain. Stop sniffing horseshit.
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:08:16
Haha well said. Seriously I cant believe a single thing anymore. All I see is retail buys.. i see no indiction that a single institution has bought any bitcoin. Novagratz keeps talking trash as well he should be trying to get his clients into buying it instead of talking so much shit.
I will believe it when we cross over 400 billion market cap.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:05:53
I feel at times when they just mention comments like this for the sake of keeping their name in the media. Bakkt better live up to everything. I am just really suspicious at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:43:24
I have been using Shapeshift and I can tell you their customer support isn't the greatest and they are extremely slow and not polite at all.

Lets put it this way... I don't trust any of these fucks and most of the time what they say is the complete opposite. They won't announce that the likely hood an ETF is around the corner that might stir some shit up. So whatever it is... I don't trust anyone and my comment about accumulation is strictly based on what has been happening at the OTC market.

That means they are going to get approved.  They need more time to accumulate at OTC.

@_date: 2018-07-09 02:03:59

@_date: 2017-10-04 15:16:03

India is like China banning Bitcoin 100 times already. Plus the money in India is real weak.
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:37:39
Seems like alot of good news today. Bittrex partnership with Invest.com (EU). Potential EU ETF as well.
Korean and Thai regulation. Good news
Bad news: India bans bitcoin for the 100th time.
@_date: 2018-07-04 08:56:46
China needs to unban Bitcoin and reopen cryptocurrency exchanges.
@_date: 2018-07-23 13:23:04
