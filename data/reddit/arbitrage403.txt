Is there a cold wallet (other than nano and trezor) that can store ALL coins? It is clear to me that next year will usher in more useless, draconian crypto laws and regs that make it not feasible to use exchanges for much of anything except tracking your txns for big brother. By then, I'm sure "KYC\-AML" will include retinal scanning and and DNA, irrespective of how long you have already used the exchange. We all know these laws have everything to do with government attempts to track tax revenue. *The 'money laundering' cover story is laughable; especially when one considers how busted and bankrupt most governments are. These corrupt, disreputable institutions who try so hard "to protect us" from ourselves, are flipping every couch cushion, looking to steal your spare change*.\*\* So, again, I am looking for a cold wallet that can hold ALL coins. I use Binance for most of my alts (I'm sure that will change soon) and I am sick and tired of having 14 different wallets for each asset: some cold wallets, some desktop clients, some QT wallets, some paper wallets, some online wallets, the list goes on and on. Muy gracias

This is going to happen eventually. It's only a matter of time. These regulatory dead-weights can only cock block for so long until the rest of the world adopts en mass, creating the pressure needed to force them the f\*ck out of the way. 'we can do this the easy way.....or the hard way'.  Your choice, SEC. F\*cking dinosaurs.

First of all, these friggin exchanges need to actually OWN BTC in order to even entertain the idea of an ETF.
