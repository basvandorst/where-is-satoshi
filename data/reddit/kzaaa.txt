Please be aware my comment was slightly-jokey. I note that comparatively wealthy and developed Lithuania also doesn't subscribe to ISO's authority.

Some people believe in it.
Some people also believe in God.
Some people believe in God so much they go out and kill people.
Ultimately very little is explicable in the manner you're looking for. It's probably best to make your own mind up rather than watching what other people do.

Consensus more than anything really. They don't follow 'the rules' though. A lot of exchanges use 'BTC' for Bitcoin but even that is technically incorrect as it contradicts ISO4217 standards. 
According to ISO, supranational currency *should* begin with an 'X'. XBT would be the most correct way of referring to Bitcoin. As for Bitcoin Cash perhaps ~~XBC~~, XBH or XCC if they aren't already taken.
Edited: XBC already in use

The internet? Yeah that was all just a fad that went away. 
Dumb-bastards who point at the 'dot com boom' as an example for why crypto will supposedly fail just shows how lacking in thought they are. Yes there was a 'boom' in the sense a load of shitty start-ups collapsed but the technology and the profitable, well structured companies carried on unaffected and today are damn-near unstoppable.

Yes.. if it wasn't in the whitepaper, it ain't Bitcoin (according to them)

Yeah.. it's more like comparing apples with jet engines.

It's funny though because we are kinda seeing in real-time a fantastic analogy of how every major religion/church denomination started.

See I've always sat on the fence and followed both relatively equally. It's always good to step outside the echo chamber.
But seems like such an unpleasant circle-jerk it's hard to find much merit in discussions over there. That doesn't mean is perfect, but is such an unpleasant and conflict-ridden environment there's little that can be taken from it.

162 member states subscribe to the authority of ISO. Weirdly, even places like Cuba and North Korea.

I more or less agree with this.
As a genuine supporter of the free market I was interested to see what would happen after August 1st. I didn't consider myself to be on any particular side; SegWit or 8mb block size - whatever the people want. To an extent I had some belief in BCH (possibly reading too much hot air on but two weeks post-fork I can only conclude that a great number of people in that sub are effectively... delusional. They speak about Bitcoin Cash being '*the* Bitcoin' in the most arrogant and grandiose terms when everything in the market is pointing towards it being a complete dud without any sort of  meaningful future, present value not withstanding. 
Three of the biggest arguments push in favor of BCH are:
* **The White Paper argument** - an ideological belief that BCH is more faithful to the original design and vision of Bitcoin. To me this argument isn't economically logical or rational so I dismiss it entirely. Satoshi wasn't a God and the White Paper wasn't a religious text. Progression and evolution are positive things to me. 
* **Decentralization** - BCH supporters would argue BCH is decentralized because it's pulling away from Blockstream and all of the centralized development. I disagree that BCH is more decentralized.. in fact this seems like a bit of nonsensical argument because BCH actually causes more centralization as it favors commercial miners who could act as a cartel.
* **Lower fees** - BCH has lower fees for now but that won't be the case for very long so it's a bit of a moot point in my opinion.

Sorry, yes my comment wasn't terribly well worded. It would be more fair to say:


@_date: 2017-08-18 17:42:36
Of course, I see where you're coming from but I still disagree with whose who throw this argument about. I mean, hell, you said it yourself:


@_date: 2017-08-18 16:29:29
BCH fees are low because it has a larger block-size and is quite simply less congested because it is the lesser used network. If there was ever a mass migration to BCH then congestion would increase. The larger block size has just kicked the can down the road at the expense of favoring commercial miners. It hasn't really fixed the problem.
SegWit takes the strain off the BTC network by permitting some transactions to be completed 'off-chain'. One of the primary arguments against SegWit is this process compromises the original design/values of Bitcoin, although I believe it to be a perfectly adequate compromise as it's an evolution of the technology.

Re-read the first point again slowly and carefully.
Pay special attention to the sentence where I describe why Tulip bulbs don't make for a good mechanism of exchange.

Dimon said his own daughter bought Bitcoin.
I hope she hodl's the shit out of that BTC and becomes wealthier than her father. That would be hilarious.
Oh, by the way.. [JP Morgan is part of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.]( Make of that what you will.

Cryptocurrency is unregulated. Period. 
Coinbase and others aren't being deceptive. The information is out there.
If you keep your coins in Coinbase, don't be surprised if you lose access to them.
The whole god-damn point of Bitcoin and crypto is you **be your own bank**. You are **singlehandedly** responsible for your own wealth. If you can't deal with that, you shouldn't be doing this.
