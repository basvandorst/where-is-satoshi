For you to not believe the screenshots and I waste my time further? I'll pass, thanks though.

How many accounts have you made to downplay Bitcoin on? 10, 20, 30?

That can happen to anyone, including me. The market seems very stagnant at around 9,000-10,000 for the past few days so I went with the logic of if it dips 100 sharply - buy in at intervals during the dip. If it keeps falling, I just keep buying. Sell at 9,700.

The best thing to do during any dip in flipping is to buy immediately and having a bank roll to continue buying as it falls. This minimizes risk, and also maximizes profit for when it swings back up.
Waiting hours will mean you're purchasing at either a plateau or when it's rising. A plateau is worse than a dip for flipping(if short-term).

Why would I have an investment strategy for the day prior when I specifically said it's volatile? For all I know it will plummet to 7k and I won't invest until it evens out again.
It's a case-by-case basis hence strategy. If I did the same thing daily, I'd be bankrupt. You obviously have no clue what you're on about.

That wasn't a dip, it was a plunge from a peak. I specifically said don't buy at a peak, my method is hustling the HODLers and micro-managing money at minimal risk. If you bought at 20k, you were an idiot. If you bought anywhere from over 12k, you were an idiot. Bitcoin's true value is around 5k and it will never dip under it. 
Bitcoin is extremely risky but extremely profitable. If you want to make a lot of money in a short amount of time, you must risk it. 
Go make another account, shill.

How much do they pay you to shitpost? I hope it's under minimum wage.

This is no surprise considering how tech-savvy they are as a nation.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:52:28
Considering you waste your time trolling Bitcoin saying the same shit over and over... I bet.

You just went in at a time bad for flipping. Don't go in when it's at peaks but when it remains level with large dips and recoveries for 2+ days.
At any point it can dip and never recover, but your risk is lowered.

Deflecting points.
Have a nice day.

Made 8,000$ just today off the influxes.
Market is so volatile that the constant fluctuation of 100's of dollars in an hour span is just a rollercoaster of money.
