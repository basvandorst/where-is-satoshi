Came for trading advice. Left knowing how to get out of a frozen lake!

I get about 0.0001 BTC (equivalent) a day mining 0xBTC with 2 used graphics cards from eBay that I fixed up (GTX 1060-3gb and GTX 970.) Granted my electricity is already paid for in the rent. It's preferable for me since it's completely passive. I should get my CPU into the mix (Ryzens are good for Cryptonight variants) once I find the right coin to do so with. :)

Technically if you turn the Intensity slider down a little, you can game while you mine. Helps to turn the shader settings down somewhat, too. 536 MH/s mining only, 236 MH/s Mining+Playing Overwatch at 74 FPS :D

Ah, for some reason I was thinking those 'faucet' sites only popped up after Bitcoin gained mainstream popularity. It would make sense. ;)

Very informative! Thanks!

You could try Cosmic, the miner I posted above for 0xBTC and newer mineable Ethereum tokens (ERC918's). Just a suggestion. If you run into any problems, me or the helpful people in the Discord will walk you through it. :)

Oh yeah, I messed with faucets briefly, but I got so little that it would've been eaten by Tx fees. :( After lots more research I found a crypto project I'm into and wrote a miner for it. Sooo much more satisfying and more nerdy fun for me, personally. But finding clever ways to trade faucet funds could be fun too. :)

Ah. Still you kinda insulted a whole country's population without meaning to

Yeah but that's so degrading, isn't it? Like if you were so broke you had to take surveys for money. You gotta think, what's your time worth

How's one do that? I really preferred those!

Why did you assume he's American? It sounds like you've got some real beef with the US :|
BTW, from my perspective, and apparently that of Brits and French Canadians, a comma for a decimal point is weird.
I ran into a wacky software bug involving those once when it was run on a PC with certain regions of Windows, like Russian or... Swedish I think?

Ohh yes, the captchas were probably my least favorite part. "Identify your own slowly-appearing grainy traffic lights &gt;:( "

A smidge off-topic, but you might enjoy something I've been working on. As a learning experience, I've been developing a miner for 0xBitcoin that's easy to use- point and click, no command-line interface. It's probably the closest thing to mining Bitcoin when it was new, using a typical gaming computer. What I'm going for is to make mining less difficult to get started with. If you've got an nVidia GPU, maybe give it a look. I've got no plans on getting rich from crypto, but it is a lot of fun.
(sorry if unwelcome, just thought you might be interested)
