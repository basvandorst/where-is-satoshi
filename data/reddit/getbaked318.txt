All the people who downvoted my comment when I told them not to buy at the $7000 range and to wait because it will drop in a couple weeks and to just buy them instead of fomoing in your faces
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:10:41
Ok let’s say I bought a bitcoin for $15000 and the price jumps to $19000 and will probably go back down in a couple minutes. I want to seize this opportunity to make $4000 so what do I do on gdax? Do I sell my bitcoin with a market order and give the fee? Or do I sell it as a limit order for 1 bitcoin and my sell price for $19000 and give a 0% fee? What would be the best option for me to make that $4000?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:33:56
Ok so this is different from coinbase. When you say “match the best price at which someone is willing to buy” how do I find the best price at which someone is willing to buy, where on gdax is this located? Also if I set a sell limit to $19000, does that mean it will have to sell at a minimum of $19000 and can’t sell below that? Another thing,I don’t understand why my order of $19000.1 would be accepted rather than the person selling it for $19000? Whoever is buying from me will lose 1 cent? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:00:49
Ok so I see on the right on the top there is a list of orders. On the left there are some numbers such as 0.9....etc. do these numbers mean that they are the amount of bitcoin people are selling and the red price is the price they are willing to sell per bitcoin? Ok so I have 0.1909335 and let’s say the best price is 17200. To beat this I would put 17202. So would I calculate 17202 * 0.1909335 and get that number and put it in my sell price when I fill out my limit order or put 17202 as the price even though I’m not selling 1 bitcoin but selling 0.1909335. So the price 17202 on a limit order means that it will never sell below that price but only that price and higher right? Also what is slippage? I noticed on the other book that for the sell the order closest to the middle line is the cheapest sell price and higher sell prices are behind the cheapest sell price. Let’s say the best sell price is $15000(the sell price closest to the middle line) shouldn’t I try to get to the middle line and sell for (14999)?

Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:00:03
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:59:48
So how does it work? If I sell at the current market price for a limit order will it be filled instantly for no fee? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:12:21
What do you mean by current top ask? (Sorry I’m new to this stuff). 
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:48:54
Rip alts 
@_date: 2018-09-25 04:48:48
What did I say, look at current price 
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:21:06
Not gonna, made way too many errors on this train, I’m sure we still have a couple of $6200 ride to $7000 then fall backs till a big boom since no new fresh money is coming in, just whales manipulating. Alts are also overvalued rn
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:28:46
I mean I use alts to increase my bitcoin and then sell that bitcoin when it goes high and rinse and repeat 
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:18:08
Hold up I thought those were leaves 
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:42:48
How is it a big risk? What would make the price sustain right now? No new money coming into the market. Just whales manipulating. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 22:40:17
Sold at $6500, currently have $1155 portfolio , gonna buy back in at $6200, increase BTC, sell at $6700, long way to go till I break even with my total BTC investment of $6500
@_date: 2018-09-25 04:48:28
Hoping it drops to $6200 so I can pick up some more BTC, but alts at low, sell alts back at high, then sell BTC at $6800, repeat 
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:14:15
No BTC should be in the front since it is the leader. If BTC goes down, everything else goes down, it’s fine the way it is 
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:00:31

I think we can hold off at the 6000s barrier. All the kids who think this current push isn’t just a pump and dump are trigger happy bitcoiners who get off from a little push

I’m crying, I’ve lost a shit ton in this crypto game fml down 98%
@_date: 2018-08-13 06:13:32
I have kinda stopped caring about my portfolio, put in a total of $6500 in BTC and invested in Alts, got burned insanely. Had about $2100 3 weeks ago, portfolio is worth now around $980 with my BTC value at 0.15, all I can do now is hope that alts and BTC goes up 
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:13:07
why will that make the price collapse? Explain please 
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:47:37

@_date: 2018-08-29 00:55:16
Don’t buy now thinking it will go up. This is a rinse and wash. Max it will go up will be $7800 then it will drop back to $6200 levels, best to just wait it out and not FOMO

I’ve decided I will not dump anymore money on bitcoin, and I’m not going to sell either. I’m going to just leave my bitcoin and will one day look back at it and hopefully the price will have gone up by then. Maybe my initial $6500 investment which is now worth $300 will one day become $10,000.

I’ve lost a lot of money and just forgetting about it for multiple days has really helped me. If you think about bitcoin ALL the time, it will really take a toll on your mental health, I was always imagining getting rich and having a mansion and driving expensive cars and shit all day long. I tried to not think about the price or my portfolio for a while and I haven’t felt better. Just accept your current situation and try to be happy with it

I’m going to be holding on to my BTC but I’m going to sell my altcoins right now, that way I can make around a 8% portfolio increase AND if it goes up, my USD value will go up too. This increase doesn’t seem natural, I’m betting it’s not going to stay for long before falling back to $6100 levels

Let me explain it simply, you buy bitcoin when it is low and sell when it is high, you can also buy altcoins with Bitcoin when they are low and sell high for more bitcoin. It can also be used as a currency but very few places accept bitcoin. Most people buy it with hopes and dreams to get rich(my situation). Beware of trading risks you are NOT invulnerable

I have one question, are you a billionaire?
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:44:55
What do you mean? Is this a good time to buy?
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:41:44
Made me chuckle 
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:41:12
So how much did you make/lose from gambling 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:28:46
Yeah I’ve decided to wait. Is volume the amount of money people are buying?
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:39:17
Seriously? So like before sex you and the prostitute are exchanging BTC addresses 
@_date: 2018-04-11 05:10:08
Bitcoin and ETH are the future of crypto
Change my mind

What Lamborghini is that

How would they know you sold your bitcoin. How do they keep track? If you sold it on an exchange but didn’t deposit any money into the bank will the IRS know?

Reason for pump? I feel if I buy now I will get burned later 
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:41:58
You guys think it will go more up? Do you think it will stay at this level or fall shortly back to $6100 levels. I’m thinking if I should buy altcoins now or wait because if BTC goes more up, then I lose BTC. Or should I sell BTC now and wait for it to drop to buy back at a lower price

Great idea thanks 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:15:51
Tell me 
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:24:05
Create a Binance account. No ID required unless you want to withdraw 100 BTC daily. I trade there. Trustworthy exchange
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:31:16
Ok thanks

You have 0 BTC fees? How do I send payments through lightning network ?
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:11:31
The transaction is cool and all but
Did you get a FRESH haircut?
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:30:57
This is confusing, I sold my altcoins before they all went crashing down so I’m pretty happy, but now I don’t know if I should try to invest in alt coins to increase my BTC or wait it out Incase this all comes crashing down. What do u guys think? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:44:15
What happens if the price swings $1000 in an hour? Do you change the price?
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:33:32
DUDE SAME. I saw 5588 and I was like shiiiit
