Say what you want about Coinbase... Hard to find one single entity that has done more for the bitcoin movement. Fucking awesome news from them this week.

I think this is only a matter of time. I would think that it's in the works, as he's invested in Bitpay.

Maybe Satoshi is Q...

is probably from a place where this is true for him. Cut him some slack yo.

Instead of saying "This is Gentlemen", I'm going to start saying "This is Illmatic".

I'm okay with companies accepting bitcoin as a marketing ploy. If consumers start using BTC to purchase goods, it doesn't matter.

Thanks broseph, this is my first tip! So illmatic.

I'd like to see this guy take Andreas on in a public (and cordial) debate. That would be good fun.

Is there more "red tape" to get through in the UK?
@_date: 2014-08-27 19:17:28
Came here to say that if 35% of US consumers bought bitcoin, that would be a huge win (with more to follow).

The trollyness is strong with this one.

It's all these bearwhale-slaying gentlemen. They have used the changetips to bury the beast for good.

Humble bundle is so gentlemen.

Maybe his mom is rather rotund and that's why he get's all bent out of shape when we make fun of fat people...

Could it also be people arbitraging GBTC?

We can assimilate OP to "The Community".   Then he will be just as vain as the rest of us.

Point taken. Seems silly not to leverage the existing bitcoin network in some way, but I really have very little idea what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:27:45
I'll bet PB plans on using the bitcoin network, but says "bitcoin-like" so that regulators don't immediately associate with Bitcoin, the currency. Very cool news.
@_date: 2015-03-03 21:59:00
Hell no. Why would I trade out of superior currency into a weaker one? Hodl till I fodl.
