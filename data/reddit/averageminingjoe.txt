Gonna need a lot of barf bags.

doubt it.
It could fall to 10k but I doubt it goes lower then that at least in the short term.

mining difficulty should fall a lot if they actually do stop the miners could be a good thing actually.

Might be true but it won't be Bitcoin that people start using as a currency it will be another crypto that is better suited for the job.
Then there is the problem that if crypto starts getting popular to actually use as a currency instead of just for speculation the government will probably make it's use illegal since they won't be able to confiscate it like they did gold.
Most likely case if crypto is the future currency then it will be a government issued crypto currency with all other cryptos being outlawed.
This is why governments are currently experimenting with creating their own crypto currencies.

"The next phase of crypto will be driven by the functional value, consumer and institutional buy-in."
This is where Bitcoin will be left behind as it's not very functional as a currency.
Get the transaction fees and transaction time down and maybe a big portion of the population will consider using it until then it's just a means to make more fiat $ through speculation.
If they don't solve those problems Bitcoin will be left behind and another crypto will become top dog.

All they would have to do is make it illegal for businesses to accept Bitcoin or any other non government crypto as payment.
You'll see.
I suspect that's their plan and I'm not happy about it but I'm confident that's what they're going to do.

It will be the central banks issuing and controlling it.
My guess is this whole thing might have been a government plot to get people on board with crypto before the governments launched their own versions.
Think about it all transactions are recorded on the block chain ALL of them.
Now they will know exactly what everyone is buying and who they're buying it from.
Starting to look like another government scheme to spy on everyone.

I didn't buy this time I did it last time because I knew it would recover.
Didn't buy this time because I wasn't sure it would recover being so close to Christmas it seems risky.
By the way I also think it's gonna fall to 8K within the next few weeks then stabilize for a while then fall to 5k.
Bubble seems to be deflating slowly instead of popping all at once like everyone thought it would.

Why would they accept payment with something that is so volatile?
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:46:37
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:04:18
Will drop to 8k with stability for a while then it will drop again to 5k.

Think this is troll post but I'll answer anyway.
Your friend is right it's backed by nothing.
It has value because people place a value on it.
It is definitely not stable look at the bitcoin price chart if you think that's stable you need to get your eyes checked.

You're right about Bitcoin.
Most other cryptos are the same but there are a few that might actually be useful as a currency such as Bitcoin Cash Monero and Ethereum.
Bitcoin will continue to fall and most will continue to hold like a tard as it falls to worthlessness.
Bitcoin is not usable as a currency right now because of the high transaction fees and slow transaction times.
Other cryptos solve this problem while Bitcoin continues to be stubborn which is why Bitcoin Cash Monero Ethereum or another will take it's place as the top crypto currency next year.
Bitcoin is nearly useless right now with it's only purpose being speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:13:32
Nobody has to do that as it's been falling on it's own quite well.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:17:18
I bought the dip sub 12000 when everyone started panic selling the other day then sold back when it recovered.
Not a holder more of an opportunist.

Yeah total dumpster fire.

I'm not sure why you're asking since it's basic math.
What's not basic math is the amount of hashing power that would stop mining.
Figure that out and you have your answer your guess is as good as anybody's and most likely it will be wrong.
Some people will mine at a loss thinking the price will increase over time which makes it nearly impossible to guess or predict.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:55:05
It's outdated there are a lot of problems with it and there are already crypto currencies that solve all of it's problems let's just leave it at that.

Mining difficulty adjusts based on the network hash rate.
If a lot of miners stop mining difficulty will adjust so a block is mined on average every 10 minutes.
This is another flaw of bitcoin as it only adjusts difficulty every 2016 blocks while other cryptos constantly adjust difficulty with the current network hash rate.
Not sure if the devs can manually adjust difficulty or not hopefully they can because imagine a scenario where 90% of the current hash power stopped mining bitcoin all at once because it was unprofitable around 20-30 blocks away from the last adjustment.
It would severely slow down transactions until the next difficulty adjustment took place.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:39:53
"Addit: Alternatively phrased, how large would fees have to become if mining became entirely unprofitable, and what transaction time would this correlate with?"
This was explained above.
The difficulty adjustments that was your answer.
As long is there is bitcoin to mine it will be profitable to some because of the difficulty adjustments and if it becomes unprofitable people will stop mining the total hash rate will reduce and the difficulty will reduce.
If you're talking about after all bitcoin has been mined then you're thinking too far ahead.
Most likely bitcoin will have been replaced by a better crypto by then.
