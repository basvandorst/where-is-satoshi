Apart from the crazy scary size of the derivatives market, I think I was most surprised how little all the earth's above ground silver is worth.
 I would never have guessed one man could be worth more!

Ok, first the Chancellor IS (arguably) in charge of the UK economy. See Wikipedia for his remit. Its irrelevant if its a publicity moment or not, he has been photographed using bitcoin, its historic, I stand by the claim.

Because he is the first person in charge of the economy of a major (G7) nation to be a confirmed bitcoin user. Two years ago this seemed unlikey.

(5) critical bug/dns attack vector discovered that causes significant  loss of confidence and/or disrupts block creation. Any outage of network for prolonged time will kill it faster than most realise. Plausible, however fairly unlikely.

Indeed, that was brain fart, I meant to say DDoS not dns

 I don't totally agree with this viewpoint. Credit cards are successful because they let people buy on credit, I don't see a way to pay 30 days later with bitcoin without using some sort of traditional style banking.
