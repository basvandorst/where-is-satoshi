Haven't watched tonight's episode yet but in the one two weeks ago they were interrogating their last web admin and he told them they needed someone who could set up a system of cold/hot wallets so they stopped getting their funds drained.

I'm currently mining ethereum on my GPUs as others have said you can't effectively mine BTC with a GPU any more. 
Even mining a profitable altcoin you will probably be at break even for electricity cost. Unless you need to heat your house.
With a 390 you could get maybe 2-3 ETH a week, and no one can tell you what price that will be day to day in BTC or USD. Right now its about $15-20.

Probably due to state by state money regs too.

It's nice because you don't leave coins on an exchange but it does usually have a premium.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:59:44
Yes, but if you buy back at the time of sale it wouldn't matter to you unless the transaction doesn't go through. The exchange rate and the bitcoin are both locked in at the time of sale so if people are trying to take advantage of a short FOMO bubble they are still going to have to wait a couple of days before they receive the BTC.
That's one of the reasons Purse actually works. Because it takes about the same time to get your bitcoin through Purse and Coinbase w/o a credit card.
@_date: 2015-12-19 01:44:58
It is a digital card. I'm pretty sure you can use it as soon as you purchase it.

And importantly that email that he registered is just very similar to the ones used by Satoshi. Not one used by Satoshi to communicate anything.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:18:34
Doesn't matter if you buy back your bitcoin. It takes about 3-4 days to get the bitcoin released from Purse as well so people can't take too much advantage of price spikes.

Basically all the evidence Wired points to are items he has been curating for a couple years to make it seem like he is Satoshi Nakamoto.
Wired points out that different archives of his site have versions of the pages without any hints to him being SN. It is pretty obvious that he has been trying to impersonate SN for a long time. Going so far as to register a nearly identical email address, and plant evidence along the way. 
 
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:08:41
From circle you just put the address in the send area. Where you would put an email address. They don't say so but a bitcoin address works too.
In coinbase there is a button that says my bitcoin address that generates a receive address for you.
@_date: 2015-06-19 05:00:45
Uh oh. According to Satoshi Bitcoin will naturally approach the cost of its creation.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:21:58

By the amount. And the amount is on a receipt. Just like a credit card transaction. 
I'm not sure how it was from the restaurants side of things but for the customer (me) it was pretty easy.
Edit: I guess I might be a little confused are you talking about for bookkeeping purposes? Or in case of double spends? I think for small amounts it is currently fine for most places to accept unconfirmed transactions as long as they are published.
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:27:29
There actually is a group of people generating keys as fast as possible and storing them. Their stated goal is to provide backups to anyone in case someone loses access to their wallet.
It's an interesting project and as far as I know they have yet to generate a collision. Wish I could remember their name. There is an old bitcointalk thread they started somewhere.

One of the reasons is an attack like the one he exploited to take these coins in the first place. As far as we know now the trezor addresses are not weak to this.
The address is stored in his deterministic trezor wallet so it should be in his wallet for a long time. Until he resets his trezor.

A few of the hacks were performed on people using teamviewer the hackers could remotely log into their computers. They probably also used keyloggers to steal their passwords. Personally I think Coinbase and circle are pretty secure online wallets. But they could fail, and they hold all your money.
I like phone wallets like mycelium or bread wallet. These store your private keys.
Online wallets at places like greenaddress or coinkite allow multisig so you can be sure no one will steal your coins unless they get your copies of the keys. For a beginner security is tough.

This is what I did. Bought some cloud mining on Dec. 10th 2013 and was just refunded on Monday. Made a 30% BTC profit.
BFL handles their orders through bitpay so purchases are treated as USD amounts and so are refunds.

Why don't you simply implement a cap so additional miners cannot join your pool? Or perhaps even close your services to outside mining. I know it is a lucrative service for you but it harms the entire bitcoin economy including you when confidence in bitcoin falls.

So... You sold and then bought within ~2% of the price? Coinbase fees are about 1% and the spread is usually much less. Personally I think it's a great way to buy bitcoin.

Thanks. I did:
Dear Christopher,
I was interested to read your story today about the subpoena served to Mt. Gox. However I couldn't view the entire article because it was behind a paywall.
The Chicago Sun-Times recently had a successful experiment using bitcoin as a payment method. I think the Wall Street Journal should allow users to pay nearly effortlessly, say with a Coinbase or Bitpay QR code or a donation button.
If these were in place, especially on articles concerning bitcoin, I believe you could gain a lot of interested readers. Readers who would no longer have to look for pirated versions of your articles.
Thank you,
@_date: 2014-12-20 20:27:03

What are your thoughts on the recent proposal to increase the number of transactions per block by making all blocks propogate at standard rates?
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:47:45

They are, basically it was a group of early adopters who had a fun idea for a project and implemented it. They were shooting at finding and storing 1% of all addresses I think.

Check out the 1sochi spam and other attempts. People have sent mass transactions of 1 satoshi to a large amount of known addresses most of which went unconfirmed. Also you can send a bundle of many small transactions with one transactions fee and they will actually be confirmed.

Just-Dice has switched to using Clams in the hope that they will be protected as free speech. I think that the legal argument that entries in a blockchain are free speech could be the key to fight regulation.
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:47:13
I imagine they have people selling their services they don't just wait for clients to come to them. I know Coinbase is actively seeking out new business I don't see why Bitpay would just sit on their laurels.

I think Wired and Arstechnica would be awesome maybe even Forbes or the Wall street journal. I know the Chicago Sun Tribune had a limited run for bitcoin micropayments but I don't think any mainstream company has fully implemented the idea yet.
Edit: Techcrunch and the NASDAQ website would be great as well. I'm surprised the crypto centric magazines are hesitant to add tipping options. Changetip could turn out to be a datamine for companies interested in reading patterns and interests of bitcoiners.
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:49:41
I know these are centralized web wallets but Coinbase and Circle allow you to send to email. Do you don't have to have your friends install a wallet. Also you probably know their email address.

Coinbase let's merchants do their first million dollars of business without fees.
Also I went to a restaraunt where they simply had the payment address as a QR code on a laminated piece of paper.
The customer only had to type in the amount of USD to send snap a quick picture and hit send. Everything was automagically working :-)

Yeah is the second iteration of the btc tipbot.
made the first btc tip bot Idk who made the first altcointipbot but it was cloned into the ltc tipbot and later copied and modified the code to create @_date: 2014-11-11 08:49:27
And be careful with your spaces/ amounts etc. Its easy to accidentally tip too much. There is a limit set at $25 that you can raise if you want. I think the tipbot is supposed to pull the lowest amount mentioned in your comment but I'd be careful just in case :-)

About 2-3 days to a bank account pretty much the same as Coinbase. I think it's probably the normal time for an ACH transaction or whatever.

I'm pretty sure the Coinbase QR just links to their merchant account but it might recycle addresses, I'm not sure.  
Also you shouldn't carry that high of a balance around unless you want to protect it. I mean you can just load up a small online or mobile hot wallet.  
Has anyone reported being mugged for btc in person yet?

While it is not blockchain.info's responsibility to protect users who expose themselves to attacks, it is our right as educated consumers to reject a product that has security flaws, frequent downtime, and infrequent updates.
I have been a happy Coinbase and blockchain user for a while, but in the past few months I have noticed a lot of issues with their blockchain data, and broadcasting transactions from their wallets.

One problem with this is I think change tip is still doing manual verification for withdrawals. While this is good for security. It makes it a very slow wallet to use for transactions. Most merchants use a service like bitpay which gives a customer a 15 minute window to make the payment. Much too short for a change tip transaction to take place. Unless they could somehow integrate with bitpay to handle offchain transactions.
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:20:26

It seems legitimate, I tried it once but it took forever because I set my discount to 30%. I didn't have any problems withdrawing my coins though. The biggest issue for me was btc volatility. Because they are selling bitcoins you can end up paying more than you initially deposited because the price fluctuates. They could fix this by locking the value of the coins you deposit, but I imagine that would cost them more money.

The way bitpay handles btc refunds is by refunding the amount of USD in btc to the customer. This is because when a purchase is made it is equivalent to selling the btc, so when the refund is proceeded the company buys btc to send the money back. No one is suggesting that refunds be denominated in btc.

Perhaps you could mine on the bitcoin testnet? Where there is relatively low difficulty so you would see a greater reward?
Edit: here is an active testnet pool 
This isn't really the intended purpose of the testnet, but if you don't monopolize the network I don't think you'd be doing much harm.
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:38:46
Well mining pools always take a little while to normalize your stats. Another problem with wanting instant rewards is the 10 minute block time. Most pools don't give rewards until 24 hours after the work is done so they can calculate fair rewards. This often leads to shifting displays of reward amounts throughout the day.

Coinbase is offering zero fees for the first million dollars.
Bitpay has two different tiers. I think it is 2% of each purchase or $300 flat fee a month.
So Bitpay is a great deal for larger merchants and I'm sure the large companies that are integrating Coinbase are getting a fair deal as well.

People have been complaining about how long it takes before Coinbase will push a transaction. When you initiate a Coinbase to Coinbase purchase it is immediate.

Yes, that is implied from my use of the word default. 
Ludicrously high is 5 times the minimum fee. Not as bad as some sites, but silly for a site that is supposed to cater to beginners. Also obnoxious about blockchain is how they have outages which result in transaction delays of up to a day at times. This gives people a bad impression of bitcoin.
Beginners who don't know any better see this site's failures as standard problems with the network. I think blockchain has a lot of catching up to do or it will fade into obscurity now that better blockchain information services exist.

But wouldn't you agree the default value is unnecessarily low? Especially for a company in an industry built upon cryptography and constantly under attack by people who happen to have large amounts of hashing power at their disposal.
The default values should be set at levels which discourage, not encourage theft from their users. Much like how their default should not have been emailing unencrypted backups to users who may not be using 2FA on their email accounts.

You can buy easily with credit/debit cards visa or MasterCard. Coinbase only accepts visa credit cards. And I don't think circle requires a bank account.
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:44:16
So far the plan is 1% of all withdrawals no? I imagine most tips bounce around a lot in between wallets so that comes to a lot less than 1% of all tips.

They process through Bitpay. Which will pay me back in bitcoin. But the amount is determined by the USD I paid initially. So it will be as if I sold BTC at $936 and bought back at a lower price.
So this makes me a nice profit in BTC. But I don't recommend it :-)

Well for one it doesn't have to be exchanged while traveling to foreign countries. But you most likely do have to exchange your own currency for it in the first place.
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:45:04
They probably just want to confirm the address so they don't send to one you don't have control of. I know I have lost btc when it was "returned" to me at an address that was an internal one for Coinbase.

@_date: 2014-12-16 10:13:17
I think personal creations would be considered private goods. Bitcoin is truly the first fungible private good that cannot be duplicated. Art/literature/music when digitised became easily accessible and yet lost value because of that. Bitcoin uses the same bittorrent protocol that destroyed those walled markets benefiting from the ease of distribution. Yet it solved the problem of duplication of digital assets with the block chain ledger!

For awhile now. They use it for their instant buy feature, which is the highest level of verification. So you need a bank account and a credit card attached to your account. Then you can instant buy I think up to $500 worth of btc. Pretty sweet deal. Too bad for me it only works with Visa credit cards :-p
@_date: 2014-09-26 08:44:57
Don't bother with time lock. Its an unkown factor in all of this. Instead just create an offline BIP38 encrypted cold storage address. This would be the safest method I could think of.
Storage for that cold address on the other hand. That could be problematic over twenty years time. But don't go for brain wallets weaknesses we can't even foresee may pop up in the next decades.

If she used circle with a credit card it might be a cheap way to buy &lt;$500 worth of coins instantly. Then she could sell those on an exchange linked to her SA bank account. I'm not sure what the best one would be. This might be a cheaper remittance solution. And it would be relatively instant. Within ~1hr she could sell the coins.
Her fees would be: Circles credit card fee, and the SA exchange fee.

As for altcoins. There is still.money to be made there but in general most will fail. I think we all knew this but were blinded by the prospect of easy money, and felt we knew something others didn't.
I agree that mining at home with GPUs is no longer as fun as it once was. I've had my miner offline since May and might use it as an alternate heat source this winter. I might, but if it's more expensive than simply buying coins there is no point.
ASIC mining is interesting but it has such quick turnover rate! I'm glad you are close to ROI I got in last November near the ATH and didn't see the returns I was hoping for :-/
Overall I think adoption will continue to grow and with it a large user base! I'm glad you met some women at the last mertup you went to, that is really promising :-)

@_date: 2014-09-30 16:32:32
You could try advertising more, like put a link up that advertises your 25% discount and directs customers to purchase the BTC amount they would need at circle instantly. Then they could get the discount with only a few extra hoops. Does circle do referral codes? You could spur a lot of new adopters if they could instantly realize savings.

How does it automatically restore the addresses where you had bitcoin stored. I understand it generates them using the 12 word phrase but it seems like that would be the salt to a ton of private keys. Does electrum sniff through every private key matching your phrase?

It seems as though coinbase claims to have only 1/3 and also 2/3 keys.
Maybe that is the difference between normal and advanced mode.
Edit: I guess they have 2/3 but the shared key is encrypted with your own password.
From the link:
COINBASE KEY
The only key that Coinbase stores. Enables you to sign transactions from your Coinbase account.
Sign transactions on Coinbase or if the User Key is lost
SHARED KEY
Encrypted with your password and stored both by you and Coinbase.
Sign transactions without Coinbase
USER KEY
Stored by you and can be used to sign transactions without Coinbase.

A lot of people generate traffic for their sites by advertising here in this subreddit. It's not unheard of to do a shameless plug go for it.
Another good idea is bitcointalk footer ads. Some places pay for people to change their footer to a linked ad for their business. This is spammy buy works great.
Also just straight up ads. Sites like coinfire and reddit allow you to place ads in areas where they would see a lot of bitcoiner traffic.

Well more people using bitcoin for daily transactions in USD would both increase the price of bitcoin and increase Coinbase's revenue.

FDIC has been used many times. Mostly during the S&amp;L crisis. Those banks failed and many people would have lost their savings if not for FDIC.
From the [wikipedia entry](  
"While not part of the savings and loan crisis, many other banks failed. Between 1980 and 1994 more than 1,600 banks insured by the FDIC were closed or received FDIC financial assistance.[37]"
That cost the taxpayers a lot, yet saved a lot of people's nest eggs.

Outside forces are causing the shifts. And the market is manipulated by the swiss equivalent of the Fed. Bitcoin in the other hand just has to deal with being completely unregulated and incredibly volatile. Not really a selling point in comparison. We have a long way to go before people start denominating anything in BTC instead of using an instantaneous exchange rate.

Seriously. Last time I was trying to by a gyft card I had the epiphany, why don't I just sell the amount of btc myself. It was so much easier than trying to find the right gift card and then reading it off of my smart phone to the cashier. Simply sold the exact amount I wanted from circle. Could have used Coinbase. Could have made an order on an exchange. I exchanged btc for USD and used a comparable amount of USD.
Its great to use bitcoin online and in person for sales. But it is already easily exchangeable for USD!

With Coinbase you can do a multi Sig vault so you still have ownership of the coins and they can't do anything without your keys.

Are we attacking this argument? It is literally the way Bitcoin has worked for years. As USD price increases people transact with smaller amounts of Bitcoin.

And this is not true: "My gut instinct was saying, “Don’t delete it!”  As Bitcoin was in its early stages, my understanding was that copying the same wallet.dat to two different computers initially seemed to work, but if you continue to use Bitcoin client to send Bitcoin, the two copies will be out of sync."
Wallet.dat just has your keys. So I guess it can mess up if you create new change addresses? But otherwise it is fine to copy across multiple PCs.
IDK I can't read anymore... Just made it thru all the numerology crap.

Also it is in the parties best interest even with 50% or greater hashing power to use that honestly. Because they would make much more money by keeping the network whole.
Sure someone could theoretically commit a 51% attack but then they are left holding the bag of bitcoins that become worthless. The only logical reason to commit the attack would be to discredit the network and destroy bitcoin. Thus it is an expensive network to attack, but not impregnable... yet.

@_date: 2016-02-16 08:16:08
The coinbase and circle prices vary a bit but are usually very close with fees included for coinbase. I would say it is possible to save 0.1-1% sometimes using circle but only if you check the rates at the exact time of purchase because they will be shifting multiple times a minute. So that 1% difference might not mean anything in 5 minutes.
If you wanted to you could arbitrage coinbase and circle prices but you would probably and up making very little on a large investment. There are much larger spreads in the bitcoin/cryptocoin economy.
@_date: 2015-07-19 09:49:24

1% has worked really well for just-dice.com.
It encourages investment. But the biggest thing you need in a bitcoin casino is trust. Without trust you won't get any investors and you can't make big bets. Until you can build a trust less contract system you will need someone like to be a standup guy and take responsibility for holding everyone's Crypto.
@_date: 2015-07-20 01:30:50
They used to use credit cards to place the ads. I doubt they accepted credit cards as payment. IMO using a credit card to buy on circle is a really fast way to get some Bitcoin. Trading Amazon gift cards for it on Purse.io could work too. Idk I just think they should use something easy and quick. Which in my experience LocalBitcoins is not. That site had me sketched out from the beginning as a Bitcoin seller because as far as I saw there were very few ways to make reversible payments.
It really showed me how awesome Bitcoin was as it was the only non-reversible payment method I could see.

Currently single collateral DAI has a function called global settlement which would shut down the whole system.
Multi-collateral DAI is not supposed to have this off switch built in.

I don't think so.
You can use MyEtherWallet or MyCrypto for Ether and Tokens. But idk of a similar web interface for BTC. Ledgers chrome apps are being deprecated by chrome apps removing usb support afaik?
If ledger makes a mobile app it could work with our Chromebooks.

Had to rewrite the chain no less.
Eth had to rewrite a smart contract. Turn a loss into a win by making the contract completely refundable.
It worked out that time. And it has been a huge learning event for the eth community. The cost was not zero. If anything I think it makes future forks less likely for similar reasons. As contract creators should have learned the lessons of the DAO.
Only time will tell though 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:20:08

It was a much smaller percentage of the existing ethereum. And a lot less people really lost the money as most of that money was held by polkadot after their ICO.
Kind of puts the "if ethereum developers lose enough money they will fork" arguement in a different light. Gav Wood wrote solidity. Main dev, lost upwards of $300M - no fork.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:10:07

You realise that decentralised ICO is a huge application? Bitcoin can't do that. You need a central authority to accept BTC for an ICO.
On eth a smart contract handles that.
Eth has gone from beer tokens and unicorn tokens to hosting over half of the top 100 coins by market cap. That took 3 years. I'm excited for the future.
@_date: 2015-09-29 05:13:44
I imagine a transaction could be broadcast as soon as you knew the funds would be in your wallet. Idk if any current wallet would do that though.

There are still a lot of fees moving into and out of the bitcoin network into fiat though. Circle has changed that a bit with 0% spreads but that's not on a scale of Visa/MasterCard or even AmEx yet. We have a long way to go but it will be interesting to say the least.

Bitcoin is an irreversible transaction protocol. Because it is very hard to do that with other methods it makes it common for bitcoin sellers to require a little more than the average online purchase.

Off chain transactions are much harder to verify publicly. Hence the blockchain in the first place.

People have a choice to make it slightly easier to access their accounts with less security.

50% profit because they burn half the bitcrystals they receive?
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:14:10
Sounds like a standard cloud mining scam :-(

@_date: 2015-03-22 00:13:47
For buying and selling. So 0% spread. Also it seems pretty fair compared to Coinbase. A similar service.
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:58:23
Not just any people either. The FBI! :-D

Well we knew about the seizure. Just not where the 800,000+ BTC went that Mt.Gox claimed to still have before it shut down/blamed the loss on transaction malleability

I doubt you could have amazon ship to someone else's address through the wishlist either. IDK how that works but you would have to have the items shipped to you and then send them on to the final buyer?
@_date: 2015-10-13 18:57:13
Went to purchase this and I'm not sure I will if they aren't accepting bitcoin. 
Apparently this happened last month with the Namco bundle as well?
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:31:33
Excellent as always.
@_date: 2015-02-07 07:15:05
It's easier the second time.
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:46:26
In the tiny print, "Offer expires 8/31/2015".
Weird they would have that wrong. Maybe it took them longer than they thought to roll out BTC adoption.
Edit: Then at the bottom of the page: Offer expires 10/31/2015. Valid only on orders placed with BitCoin.
@_date: 2015-02-13 09:04:28
There's a pin code for most features? Maybe you haven't set it up?

It's hard for some people to separate ideology and technology. On both sides.
Making fun of bitcoin cus of bitcoiners is like making fun of the internet because of 4channers. Or even earlier... IRC/BBS groups.
Sure there are some weirdos but that doesn't mean the protocol is invalid. Silly arguments.

I have a bad feeling about utuxia. Memories of trolling from the past year or so. Without validation. Care to prove me wrong magic utuxia?
Also why would anyone both buy and sell on purse. It would never strike me that I should buy some bitcoin at an inflated price by making amazon purchases. I just buy my bitcoins like a normal person and I sell them on purse for a higher price for things I like/need from amazon.
It makes no sense to me that someone would do both.
@_date: 2015-02-07 07:15:35
This gives no reward. It's just for fun.

Well how else would he redeem your goxbtc?
@_date: 2015-02-06 07:18:17
Yeah you can do it yourself from the client too. Best way is to empty the old address and you can just remove it from your wallets too. It's a pretty good way to do an even distribution but it is funny thinking crypto people would just swap their keys in.
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:51:43
Krugman called the last crisis in his columns. The Great Unraveling is a sad and compelling read of how Bush era economics fucked our country and gave the rich and financial class handouts while shafting the middle class and poor. Krugman may not be right about bitcoin but I'd take is word on US economic policy. At least hear him out.
@_date: 2015-02-07 07:28:39
Why is there no story about the Mt Gox theft though? Do the Japanese police just keep the media in the dark?
@_date: 2015-02-12 06:29:00
Punishing someone for criminal activity is statist talk? Protection of private property is a pretty important function of the state.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:37:08
Thanks again analyzer

 has an opening for advertising right now. I think it gets a lot of bitcoiner traffic.
You could also rent adspace on reddit in the bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin subreddits. If you wanted you could post directly to asking them why you should accept doge and I'm sure you would catch a few sales.
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:31:32

But if he puts clear cut regulations in place that eliminate the uncertainty of the unregulated atmosphere bitcoin businesses currently occupy it could be a great step forward.
Basically we know some sort of regulation is going to happen. So it might be good for businesses to have some guidelines which protect them from future state actions

The way did it was by having a moderator edit his flair or something so the info would appear in the banner. Kind of a workaround.

Yeah there is more risk than if he still used BTC :-/

How is Austrian economics actually built into the protocol?
Basically this is a scarce resource. Is Austrian economics built into other scarce, finite, whatever term you want to use resources?

More importantly the cash, if there is any, you receive from the transaction is also extremely vulnerable. Maybe ask them to meet you at your bank so you can deposit it right away.

From the wiki page  
"In this situation a block solved on Mars would not produce new bitcoins, but only collect Martian transaction fees. However, by the time mining on Mars becomes feasible, the block reward would probably be very low anyway and transaction fees would comprise most of miner's revenue in the first place."
@_date: 2016-05-07 06:22:34
Wouldn't be the strangest thing I've heard.
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:57:47
But you aren't really doing much but limiting your life to places that accept certain gift cards. You can just sell your BTC for USD and use it wherever you want.

So how'd you do it? I was on mobile and thought I could decode the private address from base58, but then I wasn't sure how to generate the checksum/how much of the end of the address was a checksum.

If you are a bitbug you will be pretty upset when your miner turns off. And do anything to increase uptime.

Seems like they should pay you for the name brand!
@_date: 2015-02-07 07:12:31
They should enforce penalties for bitcoin theft just like any other commodity. The FBI has shown that law enforcement has the capacity to understand the blockchain and to persecute criminals using BTC. Why are hackers and thrives different? Where is the investigation of the MtGox fiasco. How about bitstamp what are the authorities doing?
@_date: 2015-02-06 06:28:01
Well they have a provably fair selection system set up. And manage to stay legal in the US so it's kinda applicable.

What about ?
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:05:38
BC.info.isn't actually an online wallet in that sense. What you are talking about is more like Coinbase/Circle.
Despite all their faults I'm pretty sure the BC.info wallet just stores your private keys for your own addresses.

It seems like he is probably only trading with people who already sent their coin to the bitcoinbuilder account? I'm not sure how he could buy peoples goxbtc. The site has been down for almost a year.

Google is looking for liars on opinion rewards. If they ask you about a business you never heard of make sure you don't say you know it. They stop sending you surveys when they find people trying to game the system.

I think you'd flip the coin 256 times. That would create a binary sequence with 256 bits of info. Assign heads/tails 0/1 and start flipping.
Then translate that to a private key. Maybe by hashing the hexadecimal equivalent? IDK

You will need the private key to use the wallet address in a web wallet such as blockchain.info.
I'd suggest once you import that address with the &gt;$100 you should sell it for cash using circle or coinbase if that is what you want to do.
If you want to store it long term you could make a paper wallet or use a phone wallet like mycelium to hold your coin.
Mycelium can also import and sweep balances from private keys.
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:41:35
Be real. No business wants to operate in an environment that will be regulated yet is not currently.

Their sister site cryptostocks.com is a den of theives as well. It basically allows scammers a playground to create investment opportunities which are usually at beat mismanaged companies and at worst ponzi schemes. The site is set up perfectly for this as it has an optional IPO mode which freezes the selling of stocks by people other than the creator. And the creator can switch this mode on/off at will.
