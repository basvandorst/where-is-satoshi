This is the kind of drivel you get when people get paid by the word.

Virtual nothing. As if boneheads in cubes in a deadend position  in the marketing division of a company with an antiquated system could somehow ride the coattails of Satoshi to some great idea that will save all of their obsolete jobs. FAIL.

Satoshi Nakamoto.
Satoshi nakamoto who?
You will never know.

Q: If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.

I think this is a valid point. Those in the bitcoin game tend to spend fiat and save bitcoins. Gresham's law applies here.

"Might Have" "Might be" "Perhaps" "It Seems" "Possibly"...

According to your implied criteria, by the time it appears safe enough for you to invest there will be no profit left to have. The old risk /reward paradigm still applies.

I find it interesting the way you refer to everything in past tense, as if history ended the day you were born. This is a fledgling technology still in the embriotic stage. It is still in beta. The institutions it will require are not even on the drawing boards yet. And somehow, with all of the certainty of an oracle you proclaim that it is all just a pump and dump scheme. It is sad to see people outlive their obsolescence, but unfortunately sometimes they keep talking when they should be retired. Bitcoins are clearly not for you or those like you.

I would suggest that the risk of purchasing a BTC vehicle through Second Market is orders of magnitude lower in risk than leaving your BTC in Gox or any other existing exchange. Certainly leaving btc in a cold wallet is great, but if you want to be liquid it is likely that Second Market is the most secure option. This is the obvious value being returned for their management fee.

Those investing in other devices that are as yet undelivered just got butthurt.

Gox is not BTC.

No asic miner will ever make a positive return again What is your point?

I am sure there are thousands and thousands of folks happy your order got cancelled because you are no longer in front of them in the queue.

What agency should regulate it? Seriously? Better to ask which agency regulates gravity or who defines what the number 4 is.

This thread is a fraud. Proof &lt;&gt; speculation.

You are not a speculator or an investor. You are a gambler. Try Satoshidice. You can lose all of your money much faster than by daytrading.

If history is any teacher, those weasels will get their dinners eaten by smarter weasels. When tracks are this easy to follow you will always be hunted by something.

Sold out in 4 hours. May not be quite the threat we expected, but no one knows how many were sold.

Worked great for me, someone already bought my ad back. More fun that I expected.
