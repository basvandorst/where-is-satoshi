That is what my mother calls it, doesn't matter - shes still invested a bit!
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:45:53
Lol, Bitcom to the moooooon!

Took me ages to explain to my Mother, she kept saying "But its not real" - finally the penny dropped and she realized the Fiat money she had in her bank was the true fake.

The world population is around 7.6 Billion so i think you mean 39 Million people are denied a bank account.

Just finished this today.  
Highly recommended.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:18:48
yeah it is mainly just luck, for every successful daytrader there are 20 or so unsuccessful ones.

I am here for the vision of Bitcoin first and gains second.

Bucky was spot on.

Bitcoin never went away.
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:59:28
Bitcoin, for so many reasons...

A decent hardware wallet is always good.
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:28:27

For sure !

Wireless data carries risks though.

Can not beat them and amazing customer service.

And before that Alstavista!
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:20:57
Very cool
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:15:43
Spot on.
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:44:01
The picture of truth :)

First heard of pick n pay a few years back in the Die Antwoord song 'Rich Bitch'
The lyrics seem pretty apt now.

To the moon!
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:33:58
Trust me: I have tried to time it and always fail miserably. There are just many variables. Now I buy whatever I can afford to buy without looking at the 'price'.
I am happy.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:52:04
Nice start - good luck bro :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:30:09
Yes please - where can I purchase ?
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:44:34
I like what you did there !

@_date: 2017-10-09 14:54:21
is good for UK specific chat and advice.
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:09:03
I do not really understand what you are asking ?
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:48:02
The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:32:32
I think there is a good chance of that happening.
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:41:13
Love that idea!
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:36:40
What do you think will replace it ?
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:22:53
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:10:43
Never mind.
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:40:20
 
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:26:39
That would be really cool.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:19:29
Sounds good Trev
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:33:46
Looks amazing - the future is here!

Right now..
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:07:18
i for one like McAffee
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:34:45
If it is not Tesco then then the real Tesco will strip them of that name very soon.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:47:55
Yep you are correct!
In fact I can remember submitting a site to Yahoo around 95.
