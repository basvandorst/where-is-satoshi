Yes. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin are the exact same code up until August 1st (things diverge after that). So if a ton of people were to spin up BCH nodes elsewhere, this problem would become mute. For a coin that's been on it's own for 4 months, this is reasonable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:12:25
Yea definitely. A digital coin that you can't transfer is pretty useless lol. Once the price starts dropping and people start losing 10k off the price, people will sell. 
The only benefit of bitcoin right now is the name that attracts newcomers. Once people stop flocking to bitcoin because of that name, then there's no use for it. It'll be a devaluing currency as well as expensive to move.

Hey I'm a wallet dev looking to implement segwit into my system, can you direct me to some documentation or articles that would help me out?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:29
Or IOTA. I was a nonbeliever for a while but then I took 5 minutes to look into how it works. It verifies transactions without miners and actually increases in tx speed the more people use it. Pretty good solution actually
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:16:08
Versus letting it all fall apart and be unusable?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:46:34
There's a spectrum, it's not as binary as "centralized" or "decentralized". Plus to the Iota teams credit they've been transparent of this problem and say that this is only a temporary measure until there are enough users to prevent an easy 33% attack
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:01:33
I wouldn't call it completely centralized, but if anyone's reading it does suffer from 2 flaws.
1) It is susceptible to a 33% hash power attack
2) IOTA's best defense against such an attack is a single, IOTA Foundation owned "Coordinator" node, which coordinates the other nodes in the network to branch their 2 other confirmed tx's (when a tx is made in IOTA, 2 previous tx's are checked to see if their proof of work is valid)
Number 2) the reason people call IOTA centralized. It isn't entirely centralized at all, although this feature is concerning as it gives an unreasonable amount of power to a single operator (who could double spend tx's if fallen into the wrong hands).

Thank you. People here with zero dev skills keep screaming about segwit activation as if people aren't implementing it by choice.

They are being completely transparent. I'm a wallet dev, I know. They aren't being malicious when they say they have no way of knowing what kind of nodes they are connecting to, until the 2X hard fork happens, btc1 nodes use the exact same protocol as bitcoind nodes. There's no way to tell what you're connecting to unless you explicitly connect to a node that you know is running certain software. Breadwallet is doing the most transparent thing and is connecting to the original seed list that all wallets connected to from the beginning. This essentially means they aren't connecting to any nodes they have influence over in any way. They are connecting to the nodes that are available for everyone in this p2p system.
They're being as transparent as possible and as neutral as possible

Don't listen to the trolls. You guys are doing fine, it's a great app and it's awesome that it's open source. In these times it may be a good idea to talk about having more than one wallet, and probably more than one BTC branch supported, but if you for whatever reason cannot do that then I'd say go with whatever branch has the most hash power and is accepted by most mainstream businesses. 
It's about users not politics.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:58:37
If a miner takes a penny from your dollar, you should add a penny instead of letting your recipient get only 99 cents. Miners get money from the coin base reward and from the transaction fee. They are both seperate. What the 12.5 BTC reward is is the Coinbase reward, new coins that are added to the system. The 1 cent taken from you dollar is part of the transaction fee which goes to the miner as well

@_date: 2017-04-30 21:36:48
That makes _SO MUCH MORE SENSE_ especially with the differences between Unlimited and SegWit, and why the Miner's are trying to get Unlimited into effect. 


So miners don't just create bitcoin, they also handle the transactions for bitcoin?


Ahh okay that makes sense. Let's say I have 30 different people pay me 1 dollar each, so I have 30 dollars total. Does the miner take my key and the donor's hash to create _my_ new balance for each transaction? Or do I have 30 different 'documents' each referencing 1 dollar?


Is this why ether has been spiking a ton recently? I've noticed the bump in altcoins recently, but I thought it was a constant market and I simply wasn't aware of it. 
I really appreciate the detailed explanation. It really helped understand the current world of bitcoin and the reasons why there's so much drama around it right now.

I've heard of SegWit and Unlimited, but not Extension. Is that a hard or soft fork?


I'm aware of this problem, but what I don't understand is _why_ only so many blocks exist. Is that because only so many nodes exist? Or is it because the nodes only communicate with each other so often and to change that you'd need to fork btc?

Why is this? 
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:44:00
Thank you! This explains things really well. 


So what you're saying is .. when I buy bitcoin (or paid by someone), I'm not _really_ getting paid some btc file in my wallet. What's happening is I get some document that says SomeGuyThere paid me 10 dollars. And so when I pay you (for instance) 10 dollars, I give you some document that says I gave you money. So when this transaction occurs, the nodes verify it right? When they verify, how far back in the transaction history do they go to verify? What if I mined btc and just traded it exclusively among my 6 friends? 


Can you elaborate on that? Why is it profitable for Chinese miners to prevent less fees (Or are they the one's who profit from these higher fees directly?)
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:57:38
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:01:35

What's your opinion on this? It seems as though the best argument for limitation is so it's easier and cheaper for nodes to exist, which you could say is pretty integral to the btc system.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:37:33
This is true. But the fee system must be painful for smaller transactions right? It seems to me that it doesn't discriminate between btc transaction size, so if I spend $1 a day buying chocolate bars (as is my divine right to do what I want with my money), wouldn't the constant transaction fee hurt me (i.e. the consumer)? 
I see the need for limitation. But what was the reasoning to limit it so low and make it so hard to update the system? As I understand it, SegWit would only remedy a few of the problems btc currently has because only so much can be done and still be reverse compatible with Core.
If we update it now to whatever, wouldn't it still be possible to run into this problem again if the usage of btc increases even more?

I'm not saying what the ideal fee is, or even what the majority of people pay. I'm purely commenting on the output of the estimate fee method on bitcoind.

Realistically, buying 20 dollars worth of bitcoin on these machines is not feasible. I've worked on some of these machines, and the exchange rate is pretty high considering the machines typically experience purchases of 100-500 dollars. To make money they have to increase the exchange by a few hundred dollars _at least_. On top of that, the fee estimate is undoubtedly going to be high.
There's been a lot of conversation in this forum about BS wallets having shit exchange fees, but what people don't realize is that no one is trying to reinvent how fee estimates work, which is what you'd have to do to resolve the problem. Pretty much everyone uses the default fee estimate function in bitcoind, developed by Core themselves. This is what these machines use as well.
So what you have is a customer trying to purchase 20 dollars worth of BTC which is really 15-16 dollars worth of BTC, then they have to pay anywhere from 4-7 dollars to transfer it to their own wallet. Now you have a little less than 10 dollars worth of BTC. This transaction has immediately cost you 50% of your investment. Not a good customer experience.

Since I've been a protocol level developer for years and develop wallets on the side, I think my level of comprehension is perfectly fine. Don't believe me? Check my history. This is my public account.
Why worry about a Venezuelan spinning up a node? Nodes (in btc) have no incentive associated with them. If someone like a Venezuelan is spinning one up, it's for monetary reasons (or they're not struggling as much as the avg Venezuelan). What do I mean by monetary reasons? He's pointing wallets he's built or mining equipment he's bought.
But here we're worried about whether or not he can afford the basic node nevermind how expensive it is to be competitive in bitcoin mining and forget how difficult it is for someone to learn wallet development in bitcoin. And even if they did, they could always point to the dozens of public nodes on testnet for development or run something like bcoin in regrets mode so they don't have to worry about the blockchain data.

Increasing capacity != alleviating congestion.
Segwit does not increase the capacity of the blockchain, it merely allows for transactions to exist off chain. This alleviates congestion on the blockchain without increasing the capacity of it. It also allows for transactions to not be public.

It absolutely does not. It's called layer 2 for a reason. It is absolutely convoluted (off chain transactions are by definition a hack). It doesn't increase the block size and it doesn't increase capacity. What it essentially does is create a secondary network through tunnels opened up by people (and tunnel hubs) to get money to where it needs to go. Where bitcoin layer 1 is publishing txs to a public ledger that wallets monitor for addresses they own, segwit is like traveling through a shit ton of country roads (which a really weird road map) to find someone. It's an interesting concept that anyone is free to never use but make no mistake, it does not increase capacity nor the block size. What it's intended purpose is to alleviate txs on layer 1.

I've actually read the whitepapers. I work on bitcoin for a living. The whitepapers really do give miners the power of decision because they've invested money in the infrastructure of bitcoin. Not saying this is just or not, these are the facts.


Full nodes that validate. Just because miners build the blockchain doesn't mean nodes have to accept whatever they say. However, if the majority of miners support a fork, the nodes will be forced to choose between one fork or the other. Right now they are (mostly) programmed to support whatever has the most hash power backing it.

Yes, but the system is designed with future-proofing in mind.


the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.
ASIC boost is nothing more than another technological improvement, like better CPU or multi-threading. Getting upset that someone else is using this technology is like getting pissed that people are buying newer and faster computers. The solution is to upgrade.
Furthermore, your understanding of "one-cpu-one-vote" is misguided.


making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it ([Source](
The logic behind using CPU over IP is that one can artificially get more IPs for free and increase how much voting power you have unfairly. The reason why one-cpu-one-vote exists is because you can have multiple CPUs under a single IP address. This means that those who invest more in the infrastructure of bitcoin have more voting power over those who do not, which is a fair approach. Also, "One-cpu-one-vote" does not literally mean one computer equals one vote.. If that were true, it would be unfair to me if I used a usb miner compared to someone with a proper mining rig. We both have one cpu, but the mining rig has more voting power than mine. ([Source](
I get what you're trying to say. But really, ASIC boost is a natural outcome that the white papers anticipated. It's nothing to be feared. Bitcoin will face a similar but more serious issue when quantum computing is invented. That's when we have to worry, but it's something that can be somewhat easily solved (as long as the community doesn't politicize it as they have with the block size increase)

Just trying to make sense of this whole debate. I don't see Core as 'the bad guys', but why are they trying (and this is just what it seems to me) to kill bitcoin's future for large scale implementation? What could be the benefit of this?
