Has any of them actually earned money? Or are they all hodling?? Because that's what's keeping the price up: unrealized gains. Once a few people try to realize these gains, there will be no more fools to fool into this scheme and the price will go to fuck-all.

They also exist because they're not anonymous. When things go wrong, you know whose head to cut. This keeps people in check.
That's why ransomware exploded with bitcoin. Money is an extremely sensitive subject, going to the core of the human identity and morals. It should not be anonymous, it should not be handled by "mathematics".

The only thing that's changed is that big money has manipulated the price even more and more people have joined the "get rich quick" scheme.
Bitcoin isn't even the top performer. Other currencies have had bigger increase in price. Which shows that the price increase has nothing to do with usefulness but everything to do with how high this MLM can go. The moment people realize they cannot get richer anymore from this global lottery, you'll see the real price.

I'll save you the time:
1. Buy the dip, buy the rally, dollar-cost-average.... etc. In short, always be buying. Otherwise you will deeply regret it someday that you did not spend every cent you could spare on bitcoin.
2. Never sell. You'll be very rich some day and you will regret ever selling.

I understand what the blockchain is, technically. How did bitcoin gain value, that I do not easily understand. A higher valued coin will create more incentive for mining which in turn will create a more secure blockchain? But now mining is much more centralized than it was when bitcoin was worth next to nothing. So that argument does not hold value.


Apparently the definition of shitcoin is any blockchain on which you don't hold any tokens in. In the Litecoin forum, bitcoin is a shitcoin, and so forth. For now bitcoin holds the advantage of being the easiest to spend. But it's technically very, very easy to accept all currencies wherever bitcoin is accepted now. Platforms that accept bitcoin just sell it for fiat automatically. Connecting to an exchange, you could easily do this for any other coin that the exchange accepts. By that time bitcoin will have some real competition, and people will see that all along the value was in the work that was put into the technology, not in their gambling tokens.


I've never seen an investment scheme where investors strongly preach not to sell, to invest more and to convince others to join, and said scheme was not a pyramid. I myself am actually part of this scheme, bought a few last year and it was $500 because I cought a virus that wanted me to pay in bitcoin. I saw the potential for bubbles right there. I've been following r/bitcin since 2012, and I knew that people don't sell. I believe it may go as high as $20,000 until the world tightens it's security, the governments take real action and finally it doesn't suck any more "investors" and it falls on itself.
But since you said "categorically", your argument is stronger than mine.
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:32:20
If everyone keeps buying eventually the price will go up. The secret is to never spend it! The ultimate hodler takes it to the grave, thereby increasing the price for all his peers.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:45:42
Good luck on that. I find it hard to believe that 99% of the world population will forfeit all their savings because their saving medium will become worthless. People that hold bitcoin cannot accept that blockchain technology can succeed without bitcoin taking over the entire value in the world.
If you want to see how inflated that 72 billion cap is, just look at the hundreds of millions in market cap of coins that have absolutely no use or backing or future plan; but are just a wordpress website.
Lastly, while bitcoin holders love to mention Gold or Apple's cap, have you ever seen someone shouting "hold" on any of that? For everyone who has become a millionaire by selling his bitcoin, there are a hundred suckers who'll never see their money back. That why everyone shouts "hold", "cheap coins", "last chance to join" etc. The more join this pyramid, the lower the chance they will end up holding the bag.

Actually if no one sells, bitcoin's value converges to infinity. This swedish guy for example has sold nothing, so it's not like he's living the rich life.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:41:37
Gold is literally the most valuable material in electronics.
Stocks is paying a large sum up-front to get a yearly percentage of the earnings of a company that produces goods.
Digital currency is not finite. It's a simple clause in the algorithm that can make an implementation of it finite. The best examples are Litecoin, BCash, Ethereum etc. which are all superior to bitcoin in the algorithm. Of course Bitcoin can integrate their advantages, because after all it's just an algorithm, on which greedy people are gambling when will the pyramid scheme stop.
Technologies like the blockchain or smart contracts, companies like exchanges, intermediators etc., those are the real goods. Bitcoin in itself is just the biggest pyramid scheme ever created. It's own developers have noticed the crazy and have left. I moved away from bitcoin in 2014, and now I see that half the names that were the most quoted on this sub are no longer to be heard, and the other half become "shills" or "lost their mind". The bitcoin subreddit now reads as idiotic as the litecoin one.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:35:19
Actually they're blatantly trying to pump the pyramid scheme they've thrown their money into. There's no currency here. Just a global gambling medium. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:41:44
This is exactly what removes all doubt that bitcoin is indeed a pyramid scheme. "Keep on putting money into it and someday you'll be rich beyond your imagination." Pyramid schemes have big earners, too. Like those guys who are buying houses now. But for the vast majority, when they'll try to cash out they'll see that that 70 billions is actually about 2 billion.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:27:27


Fully agree on this. Both have value through consensus; one is maintained by the governments while the other solely by public consensus. Money is a very delicate matter though. Old money (cash, bank accounts, obligations etc.) is very traceable. While bitcoin is not. This is why there were no public-grade ransomware before bitcoin. There is no way to receive money without being traced. For now, bitcoin is limited to viruses. But if in a future bitcoin becomes ubiquitous, one can easily envision anonymous criminals putting a ransom on people's lifes. They can contact anonymously hundreds of people asking for bitcoins, and from the group that doesn't pay up they can kill some time in the future one or two of them. Imagine the panic in the population! This isn't commonplace now because there is no safe way to initiate this kind of ransom. But with bitcoin, this becomes child's play. Anyone, even a teenager from his room, can make disrupt your life with such a ransom. And for how much we scorn governments, when bitcoin takes over and the people "take control" away from their government, there will be much less protection. People in the advanced countries are fed up with their governments. Bu, I live in a country that 20 years ago went into anarchy, and I can tell you that you have no idea what a hell-hole society becomes without a string government.


Blockchain is the technology. Bitcoin is just an implementation of that. It's like saying your Windows installation is a technology. I don't think that the billions that have been invested in the blockchain technology are a scam. It's actually a beautiful technology with a lot of potential. At this stage, bitcoin itself should be worth a few million dollars, like 50 million. Just something to hold inertial value. And definitely not something that changes in value! Bitcoin is a simple bearer of the blockchain technology. One that can be substituted at any time by any organization as they see fit for their projects. Blizzard for example can use the blockchain as WoW money. This doesn't mean that they must or should use bitcoin.


This entire paragraph is just an opinion. Bitcoin is not a controlled pyramid scheme. There is no mastermind anymore, although there are whales. It's the people's pyramid. Greedy people like me and you have turned it into a pyramid. We are gamblers. Bitcoin seems like a good way to profit.


Can't you see, everything on bitcoin revolves around it doubling in value every few months. People want it because it'll make them rich. People don't sell it, because in a few months they can sell it for double. Like that guy who saved on groceries to buy more bitcoins.
They mention remittances, I don't know about that. But outside of that, there is no single legal use of bitcoin thats better than cash, credit or bank transfer. In fact, even in remitances, bitcoin is used to bypass the government, albeit in that case a very corrupt one. Yes, bitcoin can be a faster and a little cheaper than a bank transfer. But with banks in the middle you are fully protected. Everyone is a government-registered entity. Everything is reversible. I can send my employee to make the transfer for me. Or do it through the commodity of my virus infested PC. Bitcoin is hell as a money exchange medium. People advocate to hold it in paper and check back in 10 years... you really can't see the absurdity of it all? And even in the cases that advocate spending, it's always finalized with "buy back what you spend". Create artificial use.
Personally, I don't mind bitcoin reaching any value. What has disgusted me is the behavior of the people who hold bitcoin tokens. I've honestly never seen as much hypocrisy as there is in the bitcoin world. It's scary how easily people can be manipulated through money.

I use my currency. I work, I invest, I earn, I spend. Any pyramid scheme, especially a global one, can outperform the classic instruments for a few years. Controlled inflation is no fun, I agree. But history and studies have shown that it's necessary to keep the economy running. There is no bitcoin economy, and there never can be. No-one even spends bitcoin in reality, let alone maintain the global economy on it.
There's a ton of altcoins outperforming bitcoin by 700% too. Does this mean that they are even better, or that they are a worse scam?
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:03:03
I believe that bitcoin will make behemoths like Western Union or the banks improve efficiency. It will give them some competition. But that's all. Centralized databases and paperwork are much more efficient and secure than having an information verified by millions of nodes residing in China and making every user be a sysadmin and security admin for each of their devices, and still be powerless to a breach or an anonymous threat like "send X bitcoin or we will harm your family".
Store of value is not economy. People tried to do the same with real estate until they blocked the economy and forced society (government) to raise taxes on property. Discounts on Purse.io are not a trait of bitcoin, but rather a new business trying to gain customers. Is black friday a discount that the dollar provides?
I would personally choose deflation for my money, no taxes for me, no driving tickets no matter what I do, permission to carry a gun and fire it any time someone disrespects me, etc. What benefits a single individual does not coincide with what keeps society running. Bitcoin's deflationary trait and inability to track would lock down the economy and send society into chaos and anarchy in literally 2 days.
But let's be real here. We're not talking about a currency. We're not talking about a store of value; if bitcoin didn't promise to increase in value everybody would cash out immediately. We're talking about a global gambling scheme, where real money is mostly transferred out of the idiotic Americans into China, Russia and other countries that are exploiting this scheme.
For Christ sake, Russia chose the US president. They got the US by the balls. After a long run as the world leader, the US has now entered the descent phase.

2013 was special. Bitcoin was in its infancy as a profit medium. MtGox theft was huge, more than $100 million probably (real sale potential, not the $600 million theorical value). Bitcoin was bled dry back then. Thats not happening again. What happens now is fluctuations. Like it fluctuated 30% of its value up and down in 2 weeks. Somebody got to make few hundred thousand bucks from this. Thats how they'll make money from bitcoin from now on. And other cryptos, too. Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash are perfect examples on cryptos being just a gambling medium. There is absolutely no reason for them to exist, they're just software copies. Yet Litecoin has increased in price 2000% this year alone.
I don't see an endgame for cryptos anytime soon. The market is still young, people are loving the gambling, early buyers are still young and it will take many more years until they'll need to capitalize on their investments. So people will hold, the price will shoot up to $20.000+. So keep on playing!
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:54:48
Let me explain. There are big players in this game. Big on money, big on financial knowledge, big on crowd psychology. You see all those dips that happen because of "China news"? News has nothing to do with them. It's the big players that manipulate the market and the crowd. They start these waves where they start selling at the top. And they stop the wave, when they buy back at the bottom. The crowd tries to following them. The crowd tries to ride the wave. Some win. Most lose. Those who don't play, neither win nor lose. Their life savings are stuck in bitcoin. They feel exhilarated at their virtual fortune.
Ultimately, the whales use these "news" to mask their manipulation. At the end of the week, they've made hundreds of thousands of USD to spend at their luxury.
You're not a whale. If the simple users start selling en masse, thats the end of crypto. Thats why you must hold, indefinitely. That $80 billion market cap is probably only a couple billion. If that much gets sold, the value goes to the ground. The game concludes there... then another round will start in a few months. This is all there is to crypto. I've been following this for 4.5 years and I'm surprised people haven't realised this yet. Crypto is just a global gamble. And crypto buyers are gambling addicts. Read the messages here and you will see the addiction clearly. Whales, miners and exchanges, they are the house. They always win, little by little.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:46:59
Misdirection. They mask the manipulation. If the people find out that the market is being manipulated they will be much more careful.
Its not always related to the news though. Often these bubbles and dips have started on their own. Only 3 days ago litecoin jumped from $50 to $70. Poof! $1 billion out of nowhere!
I've been closely following bitcoin since early 2013, I've seen it all. Everything looks like child's play to me, because new people have gotten in with the dream of becoming rich, inconsapevolent of the history of this asset. And oh, how does history repeat itself!

I was giving a scenario to answer this question. Yes, predicting the market is hard, but it's also very enticing as it's the only way to make some money and enjoy life. Holding is wasting your time away as you wait for old-age riches. I'm pretty sure Warren Buffet would rather be young than rich.
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:19:16
Why focus on Ripple? Litecoin, Monero, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash and a myriad of others don't have this problem. Yet their price has skyrocketed.
Cryptocurrency is a global lottery. A pyramid with timing. You time it right, or if you're a wise whale you play it right, and you get immediate returns. Over and over. You think this dip has anything to do with China? I've been following this shit for years. Neither dips nor bubbles have anything to do with the news. There's big players playing with the emotions and the money of greedy idiots.
 The issues with this concept of value make it useless for any long term. What happens when a holder dies? One day you will die, what will it become of your holdings? Did you give the password to your family before-hand? No? "Value" lost forever. Yes? What if your wife decides to move it all in a second and move away with her lover? You lose it and there's no taking it back ever.
You don't care right now. Right now it's all proof-of-concept transaction, "hodl" and "buy the dip". All in the scope of artificial increase of price. Cryptocurrencies' price rests all in their potential to make you rich, like a lottery would.
Once people are tired of wasting the years of their lives waiting to get rich on it, or once the generation of lunatics who check the price every minute calculating their virtual fortune passes on, the crash will be sad. And I say "the crash", because there will only be 1 big one. At one point mankind will move on from this lottery, to another one.  We are at least 5 years away from it. It can go to $1 million during this time. The price really has no effect. What will NOT increase 100-fold is the liquidating ability. The first to jump ship will make a fortune, like some already have. The others, will be befunddled at how unrealistic their virtual fortune was.
Gamble on!
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:36:11
You're not going to capitalize on that investment though. Because if you ever do, the price goes downhill for the rest of the (bag)holders. Thats where the hodl mantra comes from, which is unheard of in any real investment.

If it weren't for the profit seekers, bitcoin's price would have stayed at $70-200. If you think about it, the current use of bitcoin as a payment method can be catered very well with a $2 billions market cap and a stable value. The vast majority of activity is speculatory trading.
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:24:58
Banks need a lot of activity on those coins. They can't keep them in cold storage. Remember, we're talking bitcoin's feasibility as a payment method now, not as a future investment.

Yet I'm not worried a malware can move my money without my consent at any time. And I'm not worried what happens with my money if something happens to me.

I have envisioned an even more disturbing form of crime. Since bitcoin addresses are fully anonymous, a group of criminals can send anonymous requests of "send bitcoin or be killed" to hundreds of people. Of those who don't pay, they can kill just one any day in the future, months away even. This will scare people enough that they will send those bitcoins in the future. Even if you don't have bitcoin, you will buy (whooray, price goes up!) and send. Right now is impossible to extort someone without leaving traces of your physical existence. The increase in bitcoin use will come along with the weakening of the government in the bitcoiner's ideal world, which would make this crime even more feasable.

The biggest issue with that is that digital currencies are quite hard to secure.

Actually if bitcoin is supposed to go mainstream (like a store of value even, not necessarily like currency), the tricky part is how do you pass the value to your family.
If you were to die suddenly in an accident or a heart attack, what will it become of your holdings? Did you give the password or the key to the safe to your family before-hand? No? "Value" lost forever. Yes? What if your wife decides to move it all in a second and move away with her lover? What if your self-entitled son, after an arguyment with you, decides that he deserves a car and moves some bitcoin to another address without your prior consent?
Money is a very sensitive issue. Cryptocurrencies fall flat on many delicate issues. Inheritance is one. Crime is another one. Right now bitcoin is limited to cyber extorsion but in the future, especially if there's a weaking of the government, anonymous extorsions and threats of physical harm will become reality.

Ask yourself, who might be selling from that news? The people on this sub definitely not. They're hodlers, they're into it for the long haul, and some irrelevant news from China will not make their hands tremble uncontrollably.
I'll tell you who's starting the sale. Someone who has $100 million and wants to make a profit. A big player starts the wave. Because bitcoin is not very liquid, in fact the artificial price has harmed it's liquidity, it's price will quickly go down. Now some of the people start selling. Not because they're afraid, but because they want to ride the wave. Everybody dreams of selling high and buying low. 
Once the wave loses power, the big player buys back. The price starts to increase. The whale sold at the top and how he is buying at the bottom. He knows when to ride the wave because he created it. People start buying back after that. New people want to join because bitcoin is soaring and we know that new highs are always higher than the last one. Bitcoin's price breaks through 7,000. Evil China was once again beaten by force of the free market. The bear has been slayed. Everybody is now much richer in their virtual fortune. The big player cashes out some of his new fortune and enjoys life, while the inconsapevolent hodl and dream of a future richness.

Blockchain, yes. Bitcoin probably no. Not the "early adopters will rule the world though" anyway. If it gets adopted, it will have to adhere to the principle "work generates money".

Neither. It's a global gambling scheme.

Whatever he is, his statement is right. I've been following bitcoin for 4.5 years and I can assure you that today's dip has nothing to do with China. Its big investors creating waves where they say at the top and buy back at the bottom. They time the wave perfectly because its them who create it. Usually they mask their manipulation through some "news".

You have no idea what kind of child, recluse or idiot could be on the other side of the line. Why are you debating him?

This kind of malware did not exist before Bitcoin. Bitcoin is what's made possible this kind of global ransomware. It is the only anonymous form of large value transfer in existence.
Anyway, the important thing is, how will this affect the price of my posessions? /s

"Most of the money in the market right now is invested with the intention of making more money"
I'd say all of it. Even the so-called idealists, are always suggesting to invest, keep it in cold storage and forget of it for a few years until it reaches into the millions and they can shove it to the evil government by not working and living off the work and the savings of the others.
Bitcoin is a v1.0 experiment. There's a good chance it won't be the final runner of this financial  paradigm shift. The ATMs, the gadgets, the technology and the software around it are business and scientific progress. 
The holders, the price and the miners are all fueled by the greed to fool the others out of their money.

Keep telling yourself that Bitcoin has brought absolutely no harm, only benefits. Meanwhile in the near future, every single virus will be ransomware. Teenagers will even install premade ones on their parent's PCs.
