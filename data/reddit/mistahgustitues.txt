Agreed.  Even for a non-technical person like myself it is too high level.  "OK, but what do I do with it now?"

I don't know what's so hard. I set up a Circle account Thursday night and Friday evening bought myself a shiny new bitcoin from the ZenBox in the Chicago Merchandize Mart. Easy peasy.

OK, so if I have a bunch of coins with Circle still, what are the implications for those? 
And if I move them to a private wallet?

This is great. 
I like the ticks at the top and bottom of the S. Nice throwback to ₿. 
I like the loop around the S. Makes the whole thing like look like it should really sound like Sat. 
Nice work, and thank you for the initiative!

I finally got my Ledger and have been moving my crypto over.
Two weeks ago I made a btc transaction from my Circle account to my wallet.  No problem.
One week ago I attempted to move the remainder of my balance, and when I got to the two step verification, I never received a code. No error message, no notification, just nothing.
Now, I got this strange message from them asking for the recipient details of my first transaction. Aside from just the principle, that they have no reason to have information about someone who isn't their customer, I don't want them to know my personal wallet address.
So, what do you think I should do? Give the correct information? Lie? Ignore it?
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:33:31
I don't want them (or anyone) knowing my wallet address is me.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:38:33
Haha. The actual information you gave me was well worth suffering through the snark. Thanks very much for the comment!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:28:48
Yeah, that's exactly my concern. I would like to get the remainder of my btc to my own wallet without them knowing my address. Seems reasonable to me...
@_date: 2016-12-13 19:33:28
Haven't heard that analogy. Interesting food for thought. Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:25:38
Haha! I was wondering if this type of content would come! Upboat from me!

I'm a Yank directly impacted by this, and it's also beyond me. 
Something something stopping money laundering / tax evasion / terrorism something something. 
Fuckers.

That video only raised a lot more questions for me... :-(

Especially for the Germans... They mostly all are conversational in English. The ones who would be using bitcoin, at least.

Just downloaded it. Will learn it and probably follow that advice.

I have another wallet with Blockchain Bitcoin Wallet for Android. 
Is this a generally "safe" solution?
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:19:56
Trying my best to understand all this on my very limited technical background, but, very simply:
I have about five btc sitting in a Circle account. Is this something that would jeopardize them?

I never learned in school how to respond to someone claiming that 1) I don't know what city I'm in and 2) the location information on my phone is wrong. 
What do I do now?
@_date: 2015-04-30 22:33:56
Upvote for worrying about the important things. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 04:40:20
Very good, and thank you kindly!

Anyone have an archived link to get around the paywall?
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:49:59
No, they're made of some medal. A buddy of mine bought me one. Its pretty cool. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 07:21:38
Thank you!
