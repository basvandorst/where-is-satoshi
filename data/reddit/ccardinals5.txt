Wasn't your name TheKingOfPoon?

I'll pick up a bottle once I get on my PC with my BTC. Thanks for the recommendation.
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:11:28
Is there actual news?

Although the bitcoin bashing and mockery was awful. He tried to make it look like a joke. At least he ended on a decent note: "Baby steps bitcoin." Publicity is good though.
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:13:34
Lol makes sense. Why didn't you make it TheKingOfPex or Peppers?
Also, which hot sauce would you recommend if I only wanted to get one?
@_date: 2014-09-24 19:58:33
I think those need to be on sale for me to afford them.

BTC → Gyft → Amazon GCs. You also get 3% in gyft points back on bitcoin purchases. So $100 GC gets $3 in gyft points.

How do you lose track of that much in the first place...

Gabe Newell recently said in his AMA he doesn't want to because of the price fluctuations. Some people replied talking about coinbase and he did not respond. So he is aware of it, but may not fully understand his options.
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:54:06
Not a bad idea.

I stubbed my toe earlier.

Paper can be easily destroyed in emergencies and accidentally. Of course I have back ups but I want a safe for them.
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:04:11
Good points, but they seemed to put them in a piggy bank on a windowsill overlooking a cliff.
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:05:49
I'm running Windows only atm :/
@_date: 2014-09-24 20:00:35
I couldn't find a good one in my cheap price range. I know I could drop $70-$100 and get something secure but not until we reach $1k again.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:56:15
That would be soon much better.
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:30:50
Between $0 and $∞.
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:48:24
I see the thing at the end about credit, debit, etc, but would a normal debit card work? Not much detail there. Has anyone tried it already?
@_date: 2015-05-06 22:02:07
Just bought the 2 pack, looks fun!
@_date: 2014-09-24 20:05:39
I plan on locking it down.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:29:52
You should go over to You can say that you would want Bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2014-09-24 19:39:25
I'm probably going to put a seed phrase in the box too, I just want a quality lock box.

I just bought a game on steam via bitpay using mycelium. $30 game, $3 fee. Still unconfirmed 30 mins later. Thanks Blockstream! Bought and paid for dishonest people...
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:51:39
I've used bitcoin for 5 years now. It was advertised as the currency of the internet that is nearly free to use when I learned about it. 
I'm assuming you've seen the WU/BTC comparison ad? Blockstream highjacked bitcoin and is running it into the ground for their own selfish gains. A 10% fee is far above any credit card/pay pal/bank fee. This is ridiculous and sad that people support Core's backers. 
Bitcoin was supposed to get away from centralized banking, now the developers are paid to make it into that.
And the 2 year technical debt disaster that is segwit, just wow... I'm all for increasing capacity and bandwidth. Segwit was drawn out of thin air and the witness data takes up a lot of the expanded blocksize. 1.3 MB won't do a damm thing when the network is loaded. It's an upgrade, but we will see the network choke again next big rally. Happens every time. And people wonder why other cryptos are taking such large market shares. 
Can't wait for another crypto to be more supported and accepted my merchants.

If you have a debit/credit card I don't believe circle.com requires ID for small purchases.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:12:33
Dx.com is a Chinese electronics and other things store. They ship to the US too.
@_date: 2013-06-16 23:14:37
Like I said, hit or miss.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:41:16
I would if I had any btc left. I couldn't make the list but giving to charity isn't a bad option either.

Many of these people have higher end AMDs too, and some with nvidia cards that won't do much. A 7970 will get 600+ while a 680 is only 45 if I rememeber correctly.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:06:57
Yeah,  declared it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:54:14
Once interest grows more someone will jump on the opportunity. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:54:53
I am regretting spending my coins when they were around $100, now I could have those, these games, and some leftover. At least I got a nice keyboard and mouse out of it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:15:29
Good thing I can't read.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:23:23
I recently bought a used 6870 and got 300 MH/s for only $80. Works great.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:40:08
Maybe they support charity, not all developers just want money. Of course they do, but some care about others and it gives good PR.
@_date: 2013-05-14 04:16:14
She's a girl. Therefore she deserves free money from us empathetic guys.

I got a mechanical keyboard from bitcoinstore for $20 less than the identical model listed on newegg. It is really hit or miss.
@_date: 2013-06-16 13:41:06
Bought a mech keyboard and mouse from bitcoinstore.com. It was cheaper than newegg by $25.
