Here u go.    Once you have opened the Square Cash App, just visit the “Invite Friends” link, where you can enter your friend's phone numbers to send them a referral. When your referrals download the Square Cash App, connect a debit card, and send $5 or more, you will both earn a $5 bonus credit.Apr 23, 2019
