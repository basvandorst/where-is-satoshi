I also myself don't like this guns/everyone for himself perspective. Maybe I am shortsighted by first-world culture, but I really hope/believe for a better solution 
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:37:07
but maybe there are better solutions, like multi sig with many family members or time locked wallets

fair enough, but if I for example submit a change, who chooses if it will be accepted or not? 
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:24:49
and by consensus you mean the majority of nodes and miners who choose to what software they will update?

if everyone is a retard then no one is :P

but latest bug was there they say 2 years and nobody realised, maybe it is needed to initiate a bug bounty or something similar to incentivize more people to check the code

I was thinking about a send the coins to my wallet or I shoot you situation

thanks for the answers! another thought: so the easiest way for e.g. NSA to break BTC is to force a main dev to submit a change with a backdoor so cleverly hidden that no one notices

yeah, probably, I agree with most parts... But I think most normal people will be in the "pussy" category. Most don't like needing a gun for protection. And I am not sure someone will insure it for good price if its not safe

I can send you one for free! :D :P

actually bad news for current miners because their equipment is getting outdated. Good news for Samsung, future miners and Bitcoin security and decentralization

Have you checked this? by Andreas Antonopoulos

So it is like Tether for BTC instead for USD if I get it right

Remember when you could render whole LN in everyday devices? Pepperidge Farm Remembers

Jawohl!

this would brick all today's ASICs though, which could cause much trouble

GPU mining of Bitcoin is dead many years now due to ASICS. they only mine other coins now. Mining today BTC with 1080 ti with free electricity gives you around 5 cents per year
