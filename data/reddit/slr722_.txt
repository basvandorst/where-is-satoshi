I buy both Gold and BTC. I like Gold and it's value always stays strong in any climate. Example I bought 1 ounce gold a few months ago at around 1200 USD and a few weeks ago I got some at 1220 and then recently 1190 (approx figures for examples) I like gold it is safe and strong. I also feel BTC is the gold of digital money so I hold both.
