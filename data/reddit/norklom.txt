Several years ago I've implemented KYC procedures for an online casino.  I'm not familiar with the details of the Japanese KYC/AML rules and regulations, but suspect they are pretty much the same all over the world.  We encouraged our customers to watermark the scans/photocopies of their ID-documents to reduce the risk of identity theft for our customers and the accompanying risk to our reputation of becoming associated with it.
So when I tried to verify my account with MtGox I sent a high quality scan of my passport including a (hopefully hard to remove) watermark "Sent to MtGox 2012-07". I made sure that the whole passport was still verifiable with the watermark.  To this MtGox replied:


Their concern is understandable if they trust automatic verification software more than their hopefully trained employees.  However, why should I trust their employees and give them everything required to open bank accounts, make transfers of money, and take on debt in my name?  For me personally, this risk was too big and the travel expenses of visiting MtGox in person were not worth the benefit of a "verified" account status.  MtGox was not interested in me explaining my reasons for watermarking.  MtGox should re-evaluate their balance of risk between false (positive or negative) document verification and customer satisfaction.
In the end I went to a smaller exchange and bought bitcoins at a slightly cheaper price.
