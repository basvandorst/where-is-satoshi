Um no. There's an encryption key and it is very secure. There is nothing stored on this device besides "blocks" you have access to.
You can definitely make your own USB key but this thing has a screen on it and is password locked.
Some of these physical wallets have fingerprint readers....
I would suggest getting multiple wallets and keep small amounts in 1 and split it in a few of them for obvious reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:03:43
Yeah -6% is not so terrible, but missed the boat selling at 17.5 and rebuying at low amounts...
All these normies are prematurely selling off.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:00:47
Fees are as low as what the miners cost is.
Blockchain.info is safe-ish BUT anytime you use a site with a login and password can be hacked or some pissed off employee may just steal your info.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:14:04
Damn normies! Don't sell!
But hey better for us HODLRs.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:04:43
It takes time. I got verified very very quick and got a trading rate increase after I provided extra info.
Did you send in the proper documents? And clear photos when asked?
Physical wallets are as good as you are with keeping it safe.
Thankfully there is a passphrase you will have to write down and you can store that piece of paper in a safety deposit box or something.
If you lose the Physical wallet you can "restore" your BTC with this passphrase.
I personally got a Nano S Ledger but waiting for the Trezor (new one) to come in January.
Never ever keep your money in exchanges (especially) or any online wallet OR even a phone wallet.
Online wallets are still hackable because they have a username and password attached to your blocks that you own so anything is hackable. Always use 2FA authentication (Password &amp; SMS confirm) and use very long passwords like 50-100 characters in length.
In the early stages, it's ok to keep like $200-500 in exchanges and online/phone wallets but once you go bigger, please get a physical wallet.
We don't want to see eventual suicides when people lose all their money in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:05:50
No problem!
Remember, keep your coins safe with a real wallet. That should be your first priority.
And second, don't put in money that will ruin your life. Just start small and see how it works.
The really lucky coiners were the ones who started in the 2009s+ and HODL'd. Those people might have 50BTC and they held on for so long (even though it might have been hard for them).
We can just ride the wave.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:49:40
I guess if the fees were low, exchanges like Coinbase wouldn't make so much money in between.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:14:08
It's still too early for that to do any real damage...ie control.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:49:21
It will go up the more you use it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:58:30
What do you think will happen? It dipped back to 13k before...
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:42:06
No, there is a max cap of satoshi bytes when going from BTC to BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:37:25
Get a real Nano S Ledger or a Trezor....nothing beats these.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:19:37
HODL but never ever put a lot of your personal money in this thing!
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:31:46
Man...this is sad.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:58:39
Those extra GPAs ain't gonna make you rich my friend ;)
You will get your dream job eventually, but personal investment is also important.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:38:03
For $1000 it should be around $2-4 dollars.
Where are you sending it to?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:37:03
I was about to sell but I know better.
You really need a cold heart to do this.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:39:18
HODL pls....
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:37:32
DONT FUCKING SELL! It will be 20k by end of year after XMAS.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:27:43
Both are owned by Coinbase, so if you get verified in Coinbase and everything is set up, GDAX will also work with the same credentials.
GDAX is just not n00bie friendly and they have less fees. Coinbase is the largest exchange and they have higher fees because the site is easier to use.
Get a Ledger S Nano for $80. Once your btc comes into the exchange, move it out to the physical wallet. It's always not advisable to store it on an exchange. Sites get hacked all the time (Look at NiceHash last week)....Coinbase is very big and more dependable, but you never know.
If you live in the USA, their USD Wallet is protected by the FDIC up to 250k, though, if that's any concern to you.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:50:10
Hey we were all noobs once. We need to be welcoming or else this thing will become just a place for people to make a quick buck and leave.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:54:35
Always plan ahead, my man.
Make sure your funds have cleared before doing any purchases/sells.
I stay away from Bank deposits in general and stick to CC's if it's an emergency purchase. There's a lower limit on CCs but at least it's instant. The fees are higher but worth it if you see it skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:21:41
Yep, did you lose a very low fee?
For big and important transactions I always max out the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:26:07
That is an insane thing to do. 
Never ever do something like this you’re bound to get hurt.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:58:09
Buy on Coinbase (or another exchange) and send to your physical wallet ASAP.
To get familar with BTC just get a blockchain.info (make sure it's secure) and use that wallet until you have enough extra cash to purchase a physical wallet like a trezor or nano s ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:52:57
Give it about 2-4 days total for it to clear the bank. Sometimes longer. That's weird it's showing it as a withdrawal, it shouldn't do that. Give it some more time and check again.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:07:50
If you build it it yourself might cost upwards of 4k.
The ROI (Return of investment) used to be 4-6 Months (ie pay back parts cost)...but now since ETH is higher, that has been cut in half overnight.
Also you can always sell the gear on ebay (each GPU individually or as a pack) and just say in the description its from a mining rig. Or just sell your whole rig with a discount locally or something. You will lose some $$$ when you sell, but think of it as an investment and "rental" fee.
Check for any info on that. They're probably happy now that ETH is up.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:29:35
People don't have patience...
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:58:35
They do, but certain exchanges ie Coinbase still make money from folks who don't know how to sell BTC and buy cheaper.
Also GDAX (I think) eats up the miner fees if I'm not mistaken.
I'm more afraid of Coinbase going under or getting hacked, regardless if they have bounty programs. I would advise to be cautious with Coinbase in general and set up multiple exchanges like CEX.IO etc and if you want to move money out and in quickly, spread it around.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:11:46
So glad I stuck with mining ETH :D
Started in September and going strong.
Eventually (I think in 6 months) it will be hard to mine ETH but I'll have some ETHs.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:37:10
This subreddit is good, also just check GDAX too and look at patterns.
There's so much misinformation out there it's ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:08:15
Best is put it on a physical wallet.
Keep track of the market when you want to sell, go from Wallet to COINBASE or something then sell from there.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:30:55
That wasn't my overall point.
Did you even read my reply?
I said, school and your career are important but so is personal investment. You do not want to work a 9-5 job you kind of like until you retire at 60. We're smarter than that nowadays.
I would personally advise against investing personal money in bitcoin at this stage.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:44:05
Sure if you want to keep your coins separate.
You can use 1 wallet for all of your coins.
Not sure if nano ledger supports LTC tho, I know it does BTC and ETH.
The physical wallet doesn't hold anything, it just "authenticates" you to see your coins where you can send and receive and fill that wallet.
You can lose that wallet and still recover with the paper passphrase (which you should store in cold storage) and use a new ledger. You can actually have duplicate ledgers as backups if you really want.
It's pretty self explanatory, try visiting nano ledgers site or trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:02:48
I got into crypto by mining ETH back in June and it's been fun.
I realized that I can use the mined ETH and buy BTC. I already paid off the mining rig because I did that.
Now I just HODL ETH and trade BTC.
You have to be in this for the long game or else it's not gonna be fun. 
There were a lot of naysayers saying don't mine ETH because you don't make a lot, well look at ETH price now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:59:20
LTC will fall, BTC is a stronger currency.
You have to have a cold heart to day trade. Trust me. It's not for the weak. Don't be scared of falling numbers.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:34:19
I always give a higher sat/byte like the max which is 560 i think when I'm moving large amounts of BTC (ie 0.5). In this case $25 is nothing in the grander scheme of things. Things get there faster if it's in a hurry. Anything not important like low amounts i just use normal cheap fees.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:22:32
It'll burst when greedy banks and corporations figure out a way to "defeat" it or use it for their own purpose.
For now, enjoy the wave...
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:20:20
After re-reading what he wrote, you're right. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:56:43
Thats really weird man. Also it doesn't seem like the networks are that congested.
I just sent a few K's and it cost me like $24 USD which is fine for that amount.
I use Blockchain.info as well and the fees aren't that high on that thing.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:01:03
Look at the patterns in the last few months.
It will hit 20k+ by end of year or possibly this week (maybe).
It's an unstable currency no one knows exactly what will happen unless you're a bigshot HODLER like the Winkleshit Bros and they can definitely shift BTC around if they want.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:53:59
Oh you will. Best is to HODL. 
I day trade (and night) so it's a little different for me, but from what I've seen in the last year, the people who HODL (ie buy and forget that you have it) reap the most benefits.
Obviously there are people out there who put their whole savings and even their mortgages on this thing, but that's literally gambling, just like going to a casino and giving the house your money. Remember, the house always wins.
When and if (eventually) BTC fails and something else takes it's place, the people who have invested their life savings will learn a very hard lesson.
I would split your portfolio with multiple coins..
Maybe 40% BTC
Maybe 20% ETH
Maybe another amount in another coin like Ripple. Don't have all your eggs in the same basket.
Look at ETH, it literally doubled up in about 36 hours. It will eventually correct itself and become lower, but just saying, things happen very quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:15:01
I wish I bought more when it was at 5.8k that was my biggest mistake.
But hey, live and learn. The increase is exponential, so let's see what happens. 
The way I think about this is, lets say you put in 10k of your money. You double that up, then send the 10k back to your bank. The other 10k is now "play" money. Ie you can now take chances with it and trade. If you do it this way, the only thing you lose is "time".
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:40:23
I mean it's fine if the amount is that low. I personally use blockchain.info (free) online wallet but keep very low btc in there for obvious reasons.
I would highly advise spending $80-$100 and get a real physical wallet when you reach $1000 worth of BTC.
This is coming from a guy who mined 20 BTC back in the early days but lost his hard drive and had no idea he had BTC.
Better to be safe than sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:37:40
Once it's regulated more it will be more boring....
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:12:55
Oldest Cryptocurrency around....and also the exponential growth is unnexpected and there's no way in the world that it will completely fail overnight.
There have been a few crashes of BTC in the last 9 years at much bigger paces, but it's not going to go away anytime soon...there's no one on earth who doesn't know about BTC by now. Unless they live under the rock. I've heard people (young and old) talk about BTC in restaurants, parking garages, etc. This thing is here to stay.
The biggest issue with BTC is that it's slow as shit and the fees keep getting higher.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:10:18
ACH technology is literally from the 70s but it's secure and that's what banks use to send a bazillion transactions per day.
CEX.IO allows depositing into a credit card (debit card as well??)...same with PayPal...so maybe that's the future and Coinbase will add that feature soon as it is instant, although there's a small fee.
