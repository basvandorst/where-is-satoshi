I figured. At this time asking each individual to be their own bank and manage their own operational security is still a tall order.

This is pretty cool but current US IRS tax law is screwing with adoption here. Sure we can each individually run the risk of flying under the radar depending on how much is bought/sold and/or used throughout a tax year... It would be nice to be able to buy BTC at spot price and also sell/use BTC at spot price simultaneously so there is no tax gain or loss. It adds friction but it seems the only current way to not get burned with having to account for the differences in price over time. Is that possible?

Referring to  The common public perception still seems to be that 1 Bitcoin is too "expensive" without realizing that it can be acquired in smaller amounts. Instead when looking at alternatives, sometimes they end up buying XRP and other crap because they appear "more affordable." Maybe something about psychology of owning a whole amount of 1 thing? Jokingly I wonder why not say 10K USD = 100 million satoshi? Who doesn't want *100 MILLION*?! Lol.

Sounds like Germany also imposes a capital gains tax under &lt;1 year of ownership. It's a neat concept but I don't think many people will use it if they really want to put up with the tax law. Also does this use LN? What are the fees?

Is the "vault" any more secure?

Cool! Waiting for the physical copy in the mail this week. I'm not very well educated in this space and I continue to struggle with putting the pieces together.
As it is, people seem to trade Bitcoin as a speculative currency because the current thinking is "medium of exchange" and/or "store of value" while hinged on fiat ramps, etc (and rightfully so). I also see perspectives about how bitcoin acts as a protocol akin to TCP/IP standard but this seems like a misnomer because a protocol itself (to me) is devoid/irrelevant of finance.
We soon will have a second-layer of off-chain transactions with LN which seems to mostly help with scalability. In the end, it still seems to be only associated with transfer of value for goods/services while pegged to various major govt currencies but what other application could there possibly be? How could one even envision a third or fourth layer, assuming the same analogy of the TCP/IP stack? What is this relationship between bitcoin as a currency and bitcoin as a technology, and how are they inter-related if at all over time? 
Sorry if this sounds stupid...

Nice. Already lending this book out to friends.

I was looking at Cash App earlier, what do you mean by this...?

This is why my license plate reads 1XRP.

Looks like a fun project, I want to do something like this as well. Does it also play 'Napalm Death - You Suffer' when it's no longer efficient to mine? :D

I think so. Okay so it sounds like the only application of Bitcoin is transaction of what is otherwise considered "money" but with the five pillars that the Andreas guy promotes, which is what distinguishes it from other types of money that do not align with those pillars before 2008. Do you see a time when 1 satoshi is 1 satoshi as primary acceptance like 1 penny is 1 penny? Thanks!

Here's how I understand it: If you hold crypto, any attempt to use it to purchase goods otherwise typically sold in fiat is considered a sale which triggers the tax. It's seen no different as buying fiat/btc and then selling btc/fiat, because ultimately the local currency is what is used to purchase that good.
