No remittances from UK to Canada on this chart - have they omitted all Canadian inflows?

The gold world may not have been rocked, but I bloody well am. I have an account with GoldMoney and haven't received any notification from them about this, at all. And the fact that I'm  learning about from is frankly bizarre.
Anyway, the GoldMoney website confirms [the company is being sold]( But no email, nothing.
My first take on this development is that it IF it's succesful, ie IF they manage to somehow create a viable gold-backed crypto-currency, it could pose a serious threat to Bitcoin.  I am not convinced they will pull it off, but it is potentially a big development.

The name of this company will set off alarm bells for anyone who speak French. 
[Coincé]( means caught, cornered. That may just be an unfortunate (ahem) "coincidence", but would you invest money in a company called Gotcha?

If anyone actually wants to bet on "No", then Betfair are currently offering 2/1 (3.0 in decimal odds). They don't accept bitcoin, but you should always go where the odds are best.

A bitcoin made of gold?

I believe this is a strong argument, and would take it further by saying that because a significant minority of bitcoin owners perceive bitcoin as a potential get-rich-quick scheme for themselves, this is likely to mitigate AGAINST bitcoin establishing the "alternative currency" status that the majority of users would like to see. 
The truly big players in bitcoin are rich speculators, and this will virtually ensure that bitcoin will be a very volatile (ie risky) place to park your fiat. 
Don't get me wrong, I believe some investors will make a lot of money out of bitcoin, but the majority will lose out. Although bitcoin is not a ponzi, in my opinion, this "early adopter benefit" is something they have in common.

All currencies fail at some point. If Bitcoin lasts 10 years, it will be a success in my book.

Only time will tell, but I would strongly recommend that people view Bitcoin as a high-risk investment and not invest more than they can afford to lose.

If you look at how much the value of Bitcoin has fluctuated against national currencies in the last 12 months, you will see that Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. 
There are a lot of finance guys who are trying to game Bitcoin as a hobby, and the swings in value are going to get a lot bigger.

I absolutely agree that Bitcoin could be driven to unthinkable levels, but if this happens (by no means guaranteed) it will then crash back down to earth. 
My reference to it being like a Ponzi is that early adopters may make a big profit, but most people (who come in later) will get absolutely crucified.

Fair point, but presuming that the roommate was also a drug addict, 150 BTC in 2011 prices was still enough to buy a lot of drugs.

You can have a piece of my mind. You are a shameless mendicant and a scumbag.

This is a frequently made argument, but it doesn't mean much because it revolves around the definition of "intrinsic". If you are going to be extreme about it, nothing has intrinsic value. Value is always dependent on context.
It so happens that humans have attributed value to gold for the last 5,000 years, and its unique and tangible qualities mean this is very unlikely to change. Will Bitcoin still exist in 100 years?

You didn't say how your brother died, but if $100k (in whatever denomination) is stolen from a person after their death, you have to at least consider that they may have been deliberately killed because someone wanted to steal their money.
If your brother's death was in any way suspicious, or the roommate was the last person to see your brother, for instance, then this might be more than just an opportunistic theft.

You're barking up the wrong tree my fellow reddit old-timer. I wouldn't touch Faceberg or the dollar with a bargepole.
I have no axe to grind regarding Bitcoin - on the contrary, I think it is a fascinating idea. I am, however, pro-gold, and by extension, anti-fiat. Fiat money is now essentially digital rather than paper, and Bitcoin's great failing is that it is also digital.  
The provenance of digital money will always be its achilles' heel. Even if you understand exactly how Bitcoins are mined into existence, the vast majority of people don't and never will. Do you trust electronic voting in elections? I am guessing you are smart enough to know that you cannot. 
If fiat currencies implode, which I believe they will, the only currencies that can emerge from the embers will asset-backed. Ordinary people don't understand Bitcoin, and for that reason, they won't be able to trust it. For that reason, I do not believe that Bitcoin will survive the upcoming bonfire of the digital currencies.

Bitcoin poses no threat whatsoever to conventional paper (digital) currencies. The powers that be couldn't care less about Bitcoin - they are far more worried about gold.
Unfortunately, plenty of scammers, fast-buck merchants and speculators are very interested in Bitcoin, and their inevitable presence ensures that "ordinary" investors will invariably  get their arses handed to them. 
@_date: 2012-08-02 09:34:21
Bitcoin will have many "large corrections" and the majority of people who invest in it will end up losing out. It is a fascinating experiment, created with the best of intentions but that won't stop it from being manipulated by big players and ultimately imploding like a Ponzi scheme.

Working at the weekend, too - judging by the sight of all those despondent Hammers supporters.
