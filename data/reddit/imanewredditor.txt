Did you mean bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:03:44
If bitcoin was more widely spread with fewer big holders, I would have a lot more "faith" in it.  If the price was $50/$120 a bitcoin, I would have more "faith" in it.  The reason I lack faith in bitcoin is because the spread of bitcoins is incredibly uneven and price seems so wildly out of proportion with its current utility.  I would have "faith" in bitcoin if it had had a gradual rise in price that correlated with increased utility.

But most people with money in bitcoin aren't innovating, building, or enchancing the network.  They're just waiting for the price to rise.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:10:47
I agree with the first sentence.  Even just mentioning bitcoin to a business can help.  I disagree with the second sentence.  Posting on isn't doing anything to help bitcoin.  Everyone here already knows about it.

I own bitcoin, but at this point I don't plan on getting anymore.  I still don't know where the price rise from $120 to $1200 came from, which makes me uncomfortable about buying more than I currently hold.  I mean, if I had got in when it was super cheap, I wouldn't be complaining about the rise, but I still wouldn't buy more because I don't understand the increase.  Also, the only reason I even hold cryptos right now is to tip people and do small amounts of daytrading.  It's still just a game to me.  Nice discussion by the way.
+1000 doge
Hope you don't mind accepting doge, but that's my only tipping currency right now.  It's easier for me decide how much I want to tip in doge compared to bitcoin.  Plus if I was tipping bitcoin, I would try to find the dollar value I wanted to tip, then find the bitcoin equivalent.  With doge it's easier for me to decide the amount to tip without thinking of dollars, even though I'm not sure why.  It helps me think in terms of the crypto instead of thinking in terms of dollars for some reason.
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:13:42

I would probably avoid saying "we're still up 807024% in just 3.5 years".  People who just recently got into bitcoin won't care that early adopters made money when the price rose.  They'll only care if they lost money.

How do you steal from the unborn?
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:59:04
It's also fake.
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:02:50
What is he shilling?
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:12:21
Impressive.  Kudos on tipping my entire bitcoin balance.
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:51:45


While true, I feel quite a few of those views would disappear if they had to tip money to do it.
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:33:17
So what slogan would target consumers?
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:14:25
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:51:22
Thanks for doing this.  I don't have any bitcoin in my wallet, so here's some doge.
+250 doge
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:48:25
Sounds like it fits to me.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:39:14
That might be a good thing.  Maybe people would actually think about what they post.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:01:05
You're in @_date: 2015-01-12 00:54:57
Check his post history.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:13:58
That helps a lot.  Thank you.  I don't know your opinion on doge, but I appreciate you taking the time to write this.
+500 doge
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:08:53
Thanks.  I just didn't trust a guy with his username.  Seemed biased.
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:08:47
Why would I choose between North Korea and Somalia?  I'll take the US.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:59:37


That depends on how you define "bitcoiner".  If a bitcoiner is someone who advances the use and adoption of Bitcoin by providing services, you probably aren't.
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:48:12


A centralized location where people unwillingly divulge all their personal information?
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:55:25




Seems contradictory.
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:13:35
Why?  Who is he?
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:21:48
Are you OP?
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:58:50


I've missed seeing this format.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:46:41
What is GrooveHQ?
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:24:18
He seems to be trying to stir shit up.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:34:36


Most desirable, but also incredibly finicky.  The reason this demographic is so desirable is because its members hate being advertised to and paying for things.  If Reddit attempted to paywall anything, people would probably revolt.
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:37:02
I don't trust what you're saying without sources.
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:43:59
Who is sending $0.05?
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:30:44
Are you serious?
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:44:30
Microsoft seems pretty alive to me.
@_date: 2016-03-14 01:58:58
What altcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:17:22
First they came for the iphones, and I did not speak out-- Because I did not own an iphone...
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:35:14
Good idea.  Someone should post how to close a BitStamp account.
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:00:01
Is that even hoarding?
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:52:48
Both sound like bad ideas.
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:21:47
I mean, it could be both, but I doubt it is.
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:57:11
Just like BTC.
@_date: 2015-04-07 00:08:14
And then people will realize they never cared about peer-to-peer cash in the first place.
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:14:13
I guess most people don't understand Bitcoin then.
@_date: 2015-04-07 00:04:10
How do you offend a technology?
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:22:51
To do what?
@_date: 2015-03-27 17:53:10
And spelling.
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:57:39
If I have $14 million, why am I concerned with fees?  I have $14 million.
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:36:16
Bitcoin is more like a donkey.  They separated the donkey from the cart because they would rather use a horse.
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:01:59
Oil prices are down for me.
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:06:47
How does decentralization eliminate mob rule?
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:02:05
Come on other 99.8%.
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:56:29
@_date: 2015-03-22 22:49:20
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:52:19
No.  That's a falling knife.

One nice thing about dogecoin is that you can get whole coins for cheap.  They just look better in my opinion, and I think other people feel the same.
