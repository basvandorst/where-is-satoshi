He did a lot more before that, actually. There's a reason he's holed up in the fucking Ecuadorian Embassy.

Look man, in 2010 he leaked some stuff he shouldn't have. He thought it would be no big deal. Turns out Hillary and Obama thought differently and wanted his ass dead or in prison.
He ends up in a fucking little ass Embassy in the shit end of London.
Fast forward a few more years and he realizes he's going to die in that Embassy or leave and die in an American prison. No way out. He thinks it's unfair. The US government are the bad guys, not me.
Hillary runs for president and the stars align. Only one person hates Hillary more than Assange, and that's Putin. And we all know what happens next.
The point is I would have felt the same way in 2014, and I felt the same way in 2010. I don't think he's a hero, I think he's a little bitch who got in waaay over his head and is now confined to an Embassy in London because he got outmaneuvered by Hillary and State.
Play with the big dogs or stay on the porch.

What? I think you mean DNC emails...
As for links, here, go nuts. Google your own "Russia Wikileaks Links"

You should read up on what he did *before* the election, and the reasons why he's been hiding in the Ecuadorian Embassy. IMO that's more egregious than his little foray with the Russians, which was understandable given his circumstances.
I mean, he fucked the US government and was never going to leave that embassy. He was going to die there.
So, he made a little deal to leak DNC shit and help elevate Trump's rhetoric. In exchange, a Trump presidency would at the least free him from his little prison, and at the most make him the Ambassador to Australia.
I guess at that level everyone is sort of 'dirty' but I still think Assange is a lying, self-serving piece of shit, and if you trust him or have sympathy you're a moron.

That's what I wonder. These people are poor and well... internet access? I'm just saying how the hell would they know how to transfer bitcoin? It takes some research, ya know. Would they even trust bitcoin transfers or consider it a scam? They get taken advantage of a lot already... Plus where they gunna buy it around there? Where's the person they're sending it to gunna sell it?
That's the problem with bitcoin, the buying/selling of coins is a fucking pain in the ass and no one does any transactions with the coins they just exchange them for fiat and ra ra ra aghdhsgdadsfsds.....
Bitcoin is still years away from being anywhere close to mainstream adoption/usefulness. When it does get close you can but your sweet assess that Western Union and the rest will just go from 5$ to 1$ fees and use their brand to keep market share. Whatever tho maybe not...

I sort of always thought about it like this...

Just read this. 
They bought 20 million, lost 3.7 million, and no one cared because they got billions.

You know, I was about to downvote u/spoonfednonense, but in the spirit of your post, I'll just give you an upvote instead.

What's worse is when I copy/pasted DEFINATELY in Google, the first link was:
Urban Dictionary: definately
Idiot-speak for "definitely". One of the most common moronic misspellings found on the internet.
In my defense, I didn't check the spelling because I didn't expect anyone to read it... much less get karma/ double gold. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure I make that mistake too much, so thanks for pointing it out.

And hopefully learn a fucking lesson, no offense.

My reddit front page a few days ago: Stuff about Bitcoin staying over 1k, DEFINATELY getting over 10k, and that Winkle dude saying something like he thought it would hit 40k a coin. I checked the price and it was like 900$ a coin....
My reddit page today is all about how bitcoin is crashing and the first thing I see is this suicide post... price is 575. 
This sub. Lol.

Gambling.... bitcoin investing... not seeing that much difference. Not like people were really buying things with their coins.
