It doesn't make sense as a currency for any size transaction, since you can make such transactions for free or very low fees with other cryptos and fiat. The list of bitcoin advantages is dwindling.

Bitcoin transactions used to be cheaper and faster than fiat. Cafes around me were accepting bitcoin. Now bitcoin proponents openly mock everyday use of bitcoin and pretend like $70 tx fees and week long transaction times are acceptable for a currency. It's a joke at this point with no redemption in sight.

Wtf is a fiat currency if not a store of value? That's literally what it is by definition. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 05:06:02


False, there is no definitive need for currencies to be stable or used in the short term.


Also false and baseless; I know people who store large sums of cash for decades in bank savings accounts.


Sure it can, as proven by the fact that it is.


Sure, that doesn't preclude one from holding currency as a long term store of value. Banks do it, corporations do it (how many billions in cash does Apple hold?), people do it, it's quite normal.


Bonds aren't stores of value, they're investments.
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:17:02
I personally know people who held/hold over a million dollars in cash. Firstly, you don't lose money at all if interest rates are above inflation, which they always have been in my country. Secondly, so what if you do? Of course nobody holds cash thinking it will give the greatest long term returns. People hold cash for risk aversion - to have guaranteed liquid funds available.

No, my point is that being a million dollars does not imply that you are such as a result of investing, nor does it mean you are good at investing. If you earn $2 million per year and lose $500,000 by being a shit investor, you're still a millionaire, but you're also still a shit investor.

Cheap fees is exactly it for me. I'm not going to make transactions when they cost a dollar each. That's worse than fucking Visa and Mastercard! When I got into bitcoin, one of the biggest selling points was to eliminate fees! 
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:08:38
I don't understand why people seem to be just *accepting* the fees as they are. Getting away from fees like Paypal/Mastercard/Visa impose used to be one of the great attractions of bitcoin! People used to make small transactions for free! Now it costs me an entire dollar to make a transaction, so, unsurprisingly, I have stopped transacting. This should be considered a Bitcoin-killing issue.

If there were multiple users with access to the DPR account, then why would Ulbricht continue to associate himself with it knowing that it was used to commit murder? That makes no sense. Nobody would make themselves complicit in a murder they were not involved with. The prosecution didn't even have to make shit up, Ulbricht made it piss easy for them by keeping chat logs and arrogantly thinking he would never be caught. Ulbricht is guilty as sin and you know it. You are only attempting to muddy the waters by hinting at a conspiracy theory because you want your hero to be a perfect martyr that you can worship.

That isn't an assumption or a belief at all, it's a fact. A fact that the prosecution proved with evidence from Ulbricht's own computer that he was caught using red handed. A fact that the jury took less than 4 hours to unanimously agree with. A fact that even his defence attorney admitted! 
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:08:48
Yes, they got on his laptop because he wrote and saved them, and was arrogant enough to think the Feds would never identify him.
Or maybe he's an innocent virgin, a paragon of our age, and the Feds framed him. Despite the fact that he admitted he created SR lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:52:11
Stop being disingenuous. The allegations of Ulbricht ordering murder are not unproven, they are proven facts. The only unproven element is whether murder was actually carried out - which is a completely irrelevant red herring that has nothing to do with Ross Ulbricht's disgusting and inhuman conduct. 
@_date: 2012-11-30 01:25:25

I sincerely hope you're trolling. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:38:47
Yes, but does that exonerate Ulbricht in any way? No, he ordered the murder of five human beings, he paid for them, he was told they succeeded, he was pleased about it and that's a fact. The immorality of his actions is undeniable and unchanged regardless of whether the murders were carried out or not (although it's great for the victims).
All of the people pretending like these facts are actually unknown and "up in the air" and "oh we really don't know..." should be deeply ashamed of themselves. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:10:09
He didn't know, yet he had logs of those chats on his laptop? Right. The jury was as convinced as I am of that claim. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:29:34
He is, partially. The prosecutors knew he was Dread Pirate Roberts, had an overwhelming amount of evidence - including incriminating chat logs on Ulbricht's own laptop which he was caught with red handed - and presented this to the jury including the chat logs ordering hits on five human beings. The jury ageed he was Dread Pirate Roberts snd found him guilty in under 4 hours. **Even his defence attorney admitted that he was Dread Pirate Roberts**. I know he was. You know he was. I only asked you who DPR was because I knew you would take the opportunity to lie about it and weasel your way out, not because it was an actual open question. You think you can hide behind the obvious fact that innocent is presumed until guilt is proven? Uhh yeah, **he was found guilty**. So do you have the basic integrity to admit the truth, and acknowledge you were lying?

@_date: 2018-03-27 03:41:12
They didn't present a charge, they presented some highly relevant and, in my mind, more important and damning evidence of his character than the drug related charges.
Your conspiracy theory doesn't even make sense in light of the fact that the evidence for the drug charge was already overwhelming (more than they needed to succeed). There is no reason for them to have falsified the evidence of Ulbricht arranging multiple murders. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:13:20
The crime wasn't attempted murder; he wasn't charged with anything of the sort because there was no proof that it *succeeded*. There is absolutely proof that Ross Ulbricht, AKA Dread Pirate Roberts - and don't deny it - messaged and paid for the murder of five people. This evidence was presented in court by prosecutors and taken into consideration by the jury. 
The religious worship and denial of a person's criminal wrongdoing just because you support some of their other actions is disgusting. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:39:12
The chat logs were found on Ulbricht's laptop which he was caught with red handed, and presented by the prosecution to the jury in court.

I don't think Bitcoin was ever meant to have $5 transaction fees. In the beginning, one of the great benefits was absolutely no transaction fees! If you think a grand fucking total of **seven transactions per second** is suitable for a digital currency, you are delusional. The rise of Ethereum proves my point: people don't want to pay absurd transaction fees and wait an hour for confirmation.
@_date: 2017-07-10 08:20:14
I mentioned the fact that bitcoin has an atrocious $5 transaction fee, which you conveniently ignored. Please respond. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 09:16:43
If your solution to a problem with your currency is "don't use it", then your currency has obviously failed. You know currencies are meant to be used, right? Like, the whole point is to facilitate transactions?

It's amazing how autistic you people are. At what point specifically did I say anything about 2MB blocks? Did I say anything about this ridiculous controversy currently poisoning bitcoin at all? No, I merely said 7 TPS is delusional. You extrapolated some bizarre insinuation from that so you could get on your pulpit and screech your favourite rant. Something like the lightning network is indeed exactly what Bitcoin needs - but it is apparently at the bottom of the priority barrel, of course.
Ethereum hasn't solved the problem yet, but I would bet a substantial sum that it will solve it *before bitcoin does*, because the bitcoin ~enthusiasts~ are too closed minded to ever accept that their pet currency is flawed and *can be overtaken by a superior one*. The flippening will happen. Regardless of transaction volume, my point still stands that Ethereum offers much cheaper and quicker transactions - and more importantly, implementation agility instead of childish bickering and autistic screeching about libertarian ideologies and how literally perfect bitcoin was, is and will always be. Many bitcoin enthusiasts have publicly stated their intention to burn it to the ground instead of have it change - if that doesn't spell doom, I don't know what does. If bitcoin survives, it will be *in spite of* its proponents.

Who would compel the murderer to pay? And you think that a *fine* is an acceptable consequence for a murderer? People can just murder whoever they like as long as they can afford it?


[Citation Needed]
People murder others for all kinds of reasons. Family disputes, business disputes, insurance claims... anger? No offense, but how old are you? Believing that all murder is a result of the government is blatantly absurd.
The fact is that the government does many things wrong. They should not interfere with people's drug choices, or abortion choices, or euthanasia choices. People should be free to do whatever they like, *as long as such actions do not significant harm others*. The government SHOULD exist to ensure that individual choices do not harm others. Without the government, who would build roads? Who would ensure that your boss treats you without discrimination? Who would ensure that the food you eat isn't contaminated with dangerous chemicals? Who would ensure that the environment doesn't get polluted by industries who can save money by pouring toxic chemicals into rivers?
What you are proposing is a childish fantasy. The fact that the government does things that it shouldn't be involved in *does not imply that the government shouldn't do anything at all*. That is a problem with the *implementation*, not the *concept*. The government is an indispensably positive creation.

@_date: 2013-05-26 23:28:31


Yes, that is a good thing when people's actions negatively affect others. Murder negatively affects people without their consent, and therefore the government should attempt to stop it, and punish those who continue regardless.

Yes, but why does it exist in the first place? What is the benefit of owning Litecoins instead of Bitcoins?
The entire premise that Litecoins are the "silver" to Bitcoin's "gold" is fundamentally absurd for the simple reason that bitcoin is fungible, unlike gold.

Sure, but I don't know how to move the blockchain across. And yeah, you might be able to store the whole blockchain, but the vast majority of consumers won't wait days or weeks to download an enormous file to their computer (if they even have one), and that wall in the face of mass adoption is the real problem.
@_date: 2013-06-10 04:47:52
No it doesn't... even if I was the only one willing to exchange value for bitcoin, that would mean the the person I'm purchasing them off would be extremely willing to take my money. And I'm not the only person. So your claim that Bitcoin could hit $0 is completely false.

Because bitcoin came first, therefore there logically **must** be a reason to create any cryptocurrency that came after it to compete with it.
