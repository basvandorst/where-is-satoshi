For those wondering, it's a 2004 Celica GTS with a 6 speed manual. I'd bought it for $3500 a few months back and had done it entirely with BTC. Everyone in my family said I was wasting money by getting into crypto, but who's laughing now?

That was actually part of the reason. If anything does go wrong, parts are generally a lot cheaper than a comparable German car. Also, all I need to service the entire car is my trusty ol 10mm wrench :P

The GT models had awful oil burning issues among other things. This one being a GTS has a different engine with none of those issues. Only problem I had so far was that I needed to replace the control arm, and the motor mounts are on the way out, but other than that she runs like a dream!

Amen. Besides, there is zero chance I'd be able to afford insurance on a Lambo hahaha

lmao I wish I could have owned a Ferrari. I had a hand-me-down '98 Benz that I crashed, then I had a Celica GT which got me into the Celica rabbit hole, which I then sold to buy this.

Not a GT-S model in decent shape, at least not around me.

I certainly could have gotten a "better" car (whatever criteria you use to define "better"), but the fact of the matter is that this is the car I wanted. It's just so damn fun.
I find your statement a bit ironic because my mother spent over $40000 on a car that came out the year after this Celica did and it's been absolute hell for her, and my dad isn't doing much better. This is the car that will get me *to* my job, which I actually start next week. :D

It's so much fun. It's got VVTL-i, which is basically Toyota's version of VTEC, so once you get this thing in the higher rev range it really starts moving.

It wasn't really a gamble, I put in *maybe* $200 when I was like 16, and while I understand your parallel to an extent, it's not like I legally could have bought a lottery ticket or gone to Vegas at the time I invested the money anyways lol. At the point I'm at now I could have afforded the car without BTC, I was just pointing out that I was able to pay for this entirely with BTC.

I bought it from a guy over in Bristol, PA. He was asking $5k but I haggled him down.

Department of Motor Vehicles. Basically where you go to get your license/vehicle registration/etc. The employees always seem to hate their jobs with an ever-burning passion.

Well that sounds much better than the local bitcoins prices!  PM'ed.

Would making a western union deposit be a viable option? I was looking at campbx.com but wasn't exactly sure if I would be able to just walk in and make the money order. (I don't have my license quite yet and am unsure if I would need one, I've read mixed things in regards to that)

I'm in New Jersey, relatively nearby Philadelphia.

I was noticing that they were charging up to 20 dollars more than the current price. Is the price on circle the same as the overall price?

Bitcoin wasn't worth that much 2 years ago, it was worth under $500 USD for pretty much all of 2015. Still a decent amount of money though.

hol' up lil' bitch
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:44:17
Yeah, I mean, I would still be upset regardless, especially in hindsight now that BTC -&gt; USD is over 3 times as much as it was then.

Yeah, he mainly uses it to tweet out updates regarding Telegram, which makes sense as he runs it.
