Just so everyone knows, Ken Hess has been anti-bitcoin for years. Here are some of his other articles.
I sort of feel bad for this guy. 
The more bitcoin grows, the more he's digging in his heels and grasping at straws.  That he would go out of his way on a one-man crusade to write congressmen urging them to ban it borders on some sort of psychosis.  He likely suffers from very, very severe butthurt. We should do the best we can to support him during the difficult years to come.  It's possible that his credibility as a tech writer could crumble away before him as he watches adoption increase and the price recover to new highs.  His editors will surely want to know how he got it so wrong.

Your statement actually says nothing. Worse, you fail to mention your business intentions and strategy for generating revenue. Do you have something to hide?
If nobody uses your sidechain, you have failed. If everybody uses your sidechain, you are a for-profit company run by CEO Austin Hill who would control bitcoin devleopment.
2 out of 5 of the Bitcoin Core maintainers are you founders. There is a conflict of interest. They should step down. Ask yourself this question: Would it be alright if Gavin Andresen started working for Ethereum?
If you need any more help understanding the problem (that the community will soon realize is very serious), feel free to ask.

Thanks for the reasonable and level headed response Greg. 
I suppose I am upset at the fact that you seem to have been a balancing force for a long time on debates on the mailing list and  and now are financially incentivized (even if unconsciously) to make decisions that would be in blockstreams' favor (i.e. changes to code that will enable merged-mining and two way pegging).  Of all people, I'm most upset to see you on this project.  I've spoken with austin hill in the past and have not got along well with him and suspicious of his profit model and ultimate goals to create a monopoly on bitcoin development.  I also think he's a snake taking you developers for a ride.
Here's how I see this playing out:
1. Lots of people, myself included, want to see the functionality that Blockstream is building go directly into Bitcoin Core -- but it's impossible because of trolls and skeptics who will shout FUD from the mountaintops to stop any hard fork from happening.  
2. So, you guys go create a much better network on the side chain.  I see the benefits of sidechain features so I'll move all my BTC to it.  It's inevitable that everyone else sees the benefits as well and eventually &gt;50% of all BTC are moved over to your sidechain. Even those stupid trolls who made your life miserable and impossible to implement hardfork wishlists into bitcoin1.0 will make the change. 
3.  Blockstream is now in total control of the development of the sidechain that has a majority of BTC moved to it.  Blockstream has the best talent and developers, and able to raise unlimited amounts of money from VC's to consolidate talent and firm up its monopoly on Bitcoin development.  It becomes a totally centralized system at that point, and Blockstream makes changes and dev updates based on what business needs it has at any time. Austin Hill laughs all the way to the bank with what I bet is at least a majority stake in the company.  
4. Austin Hill, CEO of Blockstream and majority stake holder, now controls development of Bitcoin (because Bitcoin is now your sidechain). Some regulators tell him to do something. You disagree with him so he fires you, and it doesn't matter because by then 90% of BTC are on your side-chain and used by 100 million people who don't have a clue whats going because their coins are in consumer wallets like Circle and Coinbase (who aren't willing to move them back to Bitcoin 1.0 main-chain because it's featureless, and Blockstream sidechain has the network effect.)
A perfect coup d'etat.
If Gavin and Wladimir are poached / paid off by Austin Hill, its game over.
EDIT: At this point, it would be reasonable for you and Pieter to step down from your roles as maintainers.  The **conflict of interest** is simply impossible to ignore.
EDIT2:  This is the equivalent of Gavin Andresen going to work for Ethereum but keeping his position as a maintainer. Would anyone be concerned?
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:42:30


1) All the BTC moves to Blockstreams sidechain because its so awesome. Even I will move my BTC.
2) It just so happens that Blockstream Sidechain is controlled by at least 2 of 5 of the same people who control the main chain, along with some other bitcoin core devs.
3) Those people are now are **financially incentivized** through their for-profit company, Blockstream, to make sure BTC live on the Blockstream Sidechain (where they have complete control of sidechain rules), and not on main chain.
4) This is a serious conflict of interest.   For example, suppose everyone likes the sidechain rules and wants to merge them back into bitcoin core main chain.  Well, if that were to happen, Blockstream sidechain would lose its competitive advantage.  So, Austin Hill just says to Pieter and Greg "Do not support merging our awesome features back into main chain, or I'll fire you."   
There are tons of potential conflicts of interest.  That is the only concern.  Sidechains and Tree chains are awesome.  Bitcoin Core devs having conflicts of interest by working on a for profit company that might replace bitcoin main chain is not awesome.

Right. Thats why I asked you if the Auction will be done in an open and transparent way?  (Btw what did I make up?)   Truthcoin won't work unless the initial allocation is done in a trusted manner.  If one party, or a cartel controls a majority of votecoins, the system won't work because they can vote for false outcomes to their own benefit.  VTC has to be distributed in a fair and decentralized manner. 


I don't think most people understand the 6 slides. ;)  I understand PM's and their implications very well having used intrade in the past, and I understand entirely what you are trying to do and say. But I suspect others find them hard to follow.  This is my motivation for critiquing them.  They could be simplified and more common english used and this why I offered to re-write them for you.    I don't recall admitting to not understanding whitepaper, just that I've given it a brief read so far.


Right. so if you own 100% of them who else would the proceeds go to?  I don't think you're trying to scam anyone.  I'm saying these things because these are the questions people will ask ;)   Here's a great example that happened during the Ethereum sale:  Ethereum could have withdrawn coins from the genesis address early and then bought more ethers with those coins over and over again and diluted all the buyers.  This 'possible scam' was brought up on the forums, and they realized the optics were important, so they made sure not to do that.
Will you be announcing how you plan to distribute/sell/auction VTC so that it's provable to the public that a single entity, or small cartel of holders don't own a majority of VTC?


Yeah I suppose its becoming a bit of a circular discussion at this point. We got off on the wrong foot so tried to improve the discourse at least. ;)
By the way, have you considered a possible attack vector would be for a *wealthy competitor* of yours to buy up a majority of the VTC during the auction using proxies... Just to purposely provide bad data on early contracts and ruin the credibility of Truthcoin?  If there isn't much demand for VTC, this might not be a large expense for them.   I know you haven't provided details on the auction yet, but its something to keep in mind on your end... and on the other end, the public will want to be confident that the auction occurred in a manner that proves the coins are distributed fairly.

I would agree that the author doesn't matter, but only if they are not trying to sell anything.  The reason you are public is because you are selling VTC in an auction, from which you will receive the proceeds. The valuation would be much lower if nobody knew who was behind the project, or where their money was going.. so you don't really have a choice if you want to maximize your raise. 


Track records are very important to investors (VTC buyers).  The more exposure and positive buzz Truthcoin has, the higher the valuation VTC will be.  It's in your financial interest to have this community excited about it, and knowing who is behind the project certainly helps. So far you seem way too sensitive to anyone asking questions about you.  You can't have your cake and eat it too. If people are going to give you money, they'll want to know who you are. 


Well, the first paper I scrutinized happened to be the pitch deck, and you reacted quite poorly to that... so I'm a bit worried about commenting further.  I've started reading the whitepaper (which I find to be a bit disjointed).  I'll have to go into detail to see if the incentive structures make sense... but from what I've seen so far and vitalik's comments it looks like you've put together some interesting ideas.


I'm not sure Reddit has anything to lose from this since the product is 'free' for them (well, there are trading fees). Only the valuation of your VTC would be affected, which you have a personal interest in. Take a lead from Bitcoin core dev's who face a ton of scrutiny on every decision they make.

You are right. It's sad that it's come to this, but Reddit has taken to paranoia over being robbed.  I think clarifying would be a good idea.


Right. I wasn't talking about using the PM's. I understand how the 2 way peg works.  I'm talking about selling VTC to people who are expecting to make a profit on them.   When Truthcoin receives upvotes or positive press, the valuation of VTC goes up.  If one of the buyers happens to be a redditor,  they'd probably want to know what the rest of the community thinks about it.
By the way... I have a question about the VTC auction. For the allocation to be trusted, wouldn't it follow that it would have to be made in a transparent and open way? 
If its anonymous, how do you stop proxy bidders from posing as multiple people (if one party held a majority of the vote coins the system doesn't work), or eliminate the possibility that you could borrow a lot of BTC from someone, buy your own VTC with that BTC, and then return the BTC to the lender.  Giving you &gt;50% of the VTC for a cost of nothing.

This is what the administrator of the gentoo bug forum had to say about Luke-jr:




To answer your question: Luke-Jr considers all Mastercoin and some Counterparty transactions as spam... so with his patch enabled by default, you can't use those things and a number of bitcoin addresses are blacklisted.
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:41:35
I have met Mark Lamb in person. He's a solid guy. I would trust my BTC with him any day of the week.
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:22:36
No, actually, you are the troll.  Trying to force your patch that changes Bitcoin's default behaviour by default and shove it down peoples throats.
Seriously. It's not going to happen. 
If you need more help understanding this, please let me know, and I can explain to you how its not going to happen.
EDIT: IS THIS THE TYPE OF DICTATORSHIP BEHAVIOR THAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM OTHER BLOCKSTREAM EMPLOYEES WHO ALSO HAPPEN TO BE CORE DEVS?
I certainly hope other Blockstream co-founders don't share Luke-jr's aggressive power-trip tactics when updating the bitcoin core code in the future to support patches that would be beneficial only to Blockstream's business goals and detrimental to Bitcoin itself... I'm seriously questioning the judgement of other Blockstream founders for employing Luke-jr considering he is ignoring the clear signal from the entire community that his patch should not be enabled by default.  Is this the kind of aggressive dictatorship behavior that we can expect from other Blockstream co-founders?  Will Greg and Pieter just call everyone that disagrees with them trolls in the future?  Is this the kind of behavior that they condone?  If Luke-jr is in any way employed by blockstream he doing serious damage to Blockstream's attempts for core devs to stay neutral.   
I also noticed that Luke-Jr's patch bans Mastercoin and Counterparty transactions.... Is this because those technologies are in competition with Blockstream's sidechains?  Are Blockstream dev co-founders using their positions in a conflict of interest ban tech that hurts their for-profit business?

Very different. There is a small chance that everyone will 'peg' their computers to their distros.  There is a very good change that everyone will 'peg' their bitcoins to the Blockstream sidechain. Even I will. It will be better then Bitcoin.  


Your word or intentions are not the issue. That you are in a conflict of interest is the issue. There is a reason why a Judge or Jury cannot be invovled in a court where a family member is being tried.  Regardless of how much they tell people 'I promise to make fair judgement'
Case in point: Assume a majority of BTC have now pegged to sidechain.  I issue a Bitcoin Core pull request to merge all sidechain features because "Look, the sidechain is doing great and everyone is moving there! the community has spoken!".  Doing this would not be in the business interests of Blockstream, because it would render their sidechain useless.  Greg and Pieter are financially incentivized (or worse, commanded by CEO Austin Hill) not to ACK.  The fact that this conflict of interest exists is not acceptable.

Satoshi had ~53 miners to start, with a nonce fingerprinting each one.  He wanted to keep track of *which miner(s)* were mining blocks for *some reason*. 
Using specific nonces per miner allows him to: 
a) Look at the Blockchain directly instead of checking his machines to see if they're up/mining. The first versions of bitcoin didn't have the RPC interface.  (Obvious question is why go out of his way to fingerprint each miner, when he could have just used that time to write an API or other solution).
b) He wanted to provably show other entites that he was mining a certain amount of Bitcoin. You can do this by signing message saying:
"Hey guys, I've modified code to fingerprint a nonce on each miner. Look at the blockchain for nonces 1,2,...n, which are ours.  I've promised that we have X hashrate. You can verify this by running a statistical analysis on the blocks at any point in the future."
Somewhere down the road they turn off hashpower for reasons unknown.
'Hey guys, we're turning off miners x,y,z,  Haspower will now be distributed across these nonces: x1,y1,z1,...n.'
This was a clever way of proving hashpower in early days. The only thing that would foil this technique is if other miners in early days noticed the nonce fingerprinting, *and copied them just to* **troll** *him*; which would be pretty unlikely.

It's clear as day that Gems is using Bitcoin, and counterparty, as marketing leverage to raise BTC in a crowd sale for their tokenized gems. They'll have a better chance pushing this to n00bs on bitcointalk.org. reddit is slightly more sophisticated.
I think they screwed up slightly because the argument against using Bitcoin because of fees doesn't hold -- they're a centralized service anyway because they're doing gems off-chain so they could have done bitcoin tx's off chain as well and only pushed to blockchain on withdrawal.

I'm having a very hard time seeing why in the face of clear and obvious rejection of his patch. He seems to just think that everyone is a troll and will still push it through.  Or is there something else going on here?
Perhaps you can see why many here are concerned about his affiliation with Blockstream and the fact that he is trying to block competition to Blockstream.  Doesn't sit well with many people as evidenced by the upvotes on this thread.

Its own legal means. Polycentric legal systems mean that there are competing laws. Under its own laws, what it does will be legal.


ParentCorp^TM will leverage corruption or monopolize other police orgs before enforcing its will, leaving it with the greatest numbers.


Small seasteading communities will likely be a poor model for large societies as they won't scale up to meet the needs of large populations and living on continental land. If I had to guess, they'll ultimately use a democratic model to operate.


If all the people in its territory hire other security orgs to take down the rogue corporation, it won't have any profits. It must take a monopoly by ideology to do so, and a polycentric system denies it this ability by removing the monopolist of law production.
You said that it wouldn't be profitable for NotCorruptWePromisePoliceForceCorp^TM to operate over a large area of land.  I countered that It doesn't need to be profitable.  MonopolyCorp^TM can own NotCorruptWePromisePoliceForceCorp^TM and operate it as a loss, since it will gain a net profit by owning other subsidary monopolies in those areas and keep them by force. 
The key here is that once the other security orgs are less in number, the monopolist becomes dictator and the polycentric law system ceases to exist.  MonopolistCorp^TM can slowly acquire them all, without much of the population knowing. If any agitators arise, they can bribe them, or kill them through AssasinationCorp^TM with their capital.
Power consolidation is inevitable. If you'd like to see examples, almost any book on human history will do.


History and human nature says otherwise.  Your proposition is extraordinary. 
Extraordinary claims and propositions require extraordinary evidence and arguments to support them.  Unfortunately, 'the free market will take care of it, don't worry' isn't an extraordinary supporting argument.  So, that should give you an idea of why the majority dismisses your propositions.


Alright, I'll rephrase, polycentric law ultimately ends in centralized law under an entity which controls force in that particular territory.
And guess what, we have that today! It's called the earth. There are almost 212 different law providers, you can feel free to chose the one you like best.  Canada, the USA, and the UK have immigrants flocking to them. I suppose they're quite popular!

The strength of the network only increases as there are more individual entities mining. Hashrate sadly has nothing to do with it.  A) 1 Million miners at 1 hash per second is better then B) 100 miners at 100Th/sec (assuming all else equal (i.e. an entity doesn't have a significant ability to put out miners much higher then what is on the market)
Unfortunately, your comment is a common term known 'Miner Marketing Bullshit' where they tell you 'Hey, even if you lose money, you're helping to secure the network!' even though they know everyone will mine at ghash.io which runs up on 50% all the time.
And also, the network is more centralized then ever. A cartel of 4-5 mining companies make all the chips.

What total bullshit. The government doesn't have a monopoly on force. Society as a whole has a monopoly on force as society elects the people who form the government.  
In your anarcho-capitalist world, SecurityCorpInc^TM would have a monopolgy on force over society, because there would be no governments to enforce anti-monpoly and anti-trust laws.  And I'll sure as fuck bet you that SecurityCorpInc^TM won't be answerable to the people; they'll be answerable to eric voorhees, and roger ver. i.e. the rich elites with the money.
Your utopian AC world is actually hell on earth.
PS why did I even use a ^TM sign? There won't be a trademark office, and nobody to enforce copyright violations.  Courts will be private since there's no state. So I'll just have SecurityCorpInc^TM's FairCourtWePromise^TM subsidiary to hear my copyright infringement case.  Oh, the nature of humans hasn't changed in the AC world, so it will be easy to bribe them with no oversight.  Also, all jails are private, so I can just pay off SecurityCorpInc^TM's  JailsAreUs^TM subsidary if at any time I'm imprisoned for some reason.

Yes, we've read what it does.  It's Luke-jr's personal blacklist database.


No. DDoS attacks are dealt with by adding a pull request to the github master and then devs discuss adding the code.   Not by forcing a change to default behavior.  Also, considering the services in luke-jr's hand-picked blacklist database as DDoS attackers is entirely subjective based on whether or not you think bitcoin should be open and anyone who pays transactions fees can make transactions.  This is a seperate debate.  The issue here is that Luke-jr is unilaterally imposing what he thinks default behavior should be on others, and forcing them to remove his patch if they don't like it.

Your analogy is terribly inaccurate. There is no demand for penny stocks in the first place, so being able to buy them from a Schwab won't help their prices go up.
On the other hand, there is lots of demand to buy bitcoin, but it is difficult.  Being able to use a Schwab account to buy bitcoin will simplify that process, and allow all of that demand to flow into the market.
I am not cocky or confident.  The data speaks for itself.  Just in the past 24 hours there has been 250,000 BTC volume at around $325.  Thats over $81,000,000 
If you want to ignore market data that shows there's huge demand for retail and institutional investment in bitcoin thats up to you, but as I said, it would mean you simply don't understand financial markets.

Wrong here again, MonopolyCorp^TM will use its corrupt NotCorruptWePromisePoliceForceCorp^TM to force its will upon others, in addition to aquiring other verticals and horizontals, and hiring AssasinsUnited^TM to kill people it deems competitive.  Corrupt people, special interests, and monopolies will be harder to remove in ancap world then in current system.


You're forgetting that NotCorruptWePromisePoliceForceCorp^TM  is a subsidary of ParentCorp^TM, and can maintain losses because its ability force the will of ParentCorp^TM on the territory it operates results in a net profit for ParentCorp^TM.


My fear is not unfounded, (as I've explained above). Your basis of modeling a society on only economic principles is incredibly naive.  You're ignoring human nature and the use of force. When it is privatized, you have what is happening in Iraq and Syria.  ISIS is equivalent to NotCorruptWePromisePoliceForceCorp^TM.


No, my responses assume no laws.


A society where each person makes up their own laws (i.e. no consensus on law) will effectively mean there are no laws, and would be counterproductive to the economy as a whole.


They didn't do that. They forced the corrupt members out through the current political process.
Furthurmore, your system has a horrible attack vector.  If one evil person ends up with the most capital, he can bribe and buy any other Corp^TM. Then enforce his will through violence, since he owns PoliceCorp^TM, FairLawsCorp^TM, and FairCourtSystemWePromiseCorp^TM, he is above the law. 
*In effect, the richest person in ancap land has a monopoly on violence and is king and dictator.*
To sum up, the privatization of force is much worse then then use of force granted to a public body by the people through societal consensus.

You're missing the point. The peg isn't the issue. Moving coins to their sidechain is the issue. This isn't about the value of bitcoins. BTC can be moved to any sidechain.  Blockstream will have the best sidechain, and as long as they do, BTC will move there. Thats a problem due to the conflict of interest Greg and Pieter will have as I mentioned above.

1. Wow. Really? Barely a dozen miners must have been on the network during this time.

3. As long as nobody else mines blocks with the same LSB's as satoshi, it does prove the blocks are his. Obviously some blocks in the fingerprinted nonce range won't belong to satoshi because of randomness, but if he promised not to spend blocks he mined it would become obvious later on.

If I create a color with Open Assets (not using coinprism.com), how do I add it to the Coinprism wallet?  
I don't see an option to manually add colors.
If someone sends a color to coinprism that the wallet doesn't detect, will it treat it as a regular bitcoin transaction, include it in the Bitcoin balance, and then de-color the bitcoins when they are sent out?

No.  The blue and red lines indicate opportunities to trade within the band to make additional profit.  However, if the trend continues, you can buy anywhere within the band and still profit over a long period of time.  Ideally you would buy on the blue line to increase your profit. 
Perhaps the red should be labeled as 'not a good time to buy' rather then sell.

Node ops who provide the service for free, all else equal (i.e. uptime and service is just as good), will be chosen over those who charge a fee. basic economics.
The fact is that with an abundance of VPS providers these days, resources are very cheap, and there are enough bitcoiners with deep pockets to provide node services for free, to help the network and protect their investment.  Charging a pool fee is no longer a viable business model.

This is simply incorrect.  If the tech proves itself to have no consensus problems, it can be forked into core.  It wouldn't be any more unmanageable then it is today.  It's an open source project with many contributors.

1) There would be a concerted effort by the entire industry to alert everyone to freeze payment activity immediately.
2) The core devs would swap out the broken sha256 algo for one that is deemed secure.
3) Carry on as usual.


If this happened, core devs would take a snapshot of the blockchain at the last known good block before it was overwritten by a re-org to the fake attackers chain. (There are backups)  Then they'd throw all the UTXO's into a new blockchain, change the proof-of-work algo, and off we go.

It might seem that way. However if you understand the underlying tech, you'll realize quickly this was just a marketing stunt. The implementation simply isn't scaleable.

1. Hmm, coinapult talks about how the colored coins and other platforms are bad because you have to trust the asset issuer... but you still have to do that with coinapult.


So now Coinapult is the aggregate of risk, and if one of the asset issuers they buy from defaults, there are still going to be losses. 
2. You don't have true ownership of assets with this model, just a way to settle in Bitcoin for other assets.  With colored coins, you have true ownership of the underlying and can take delivery whenever you want.  You can also send colored coins directly to others as payment without having to 'lock' away any BTC in the first place, or interact with Coinapult's system.

Jimmy, 
It doesn't matter what the bid/ask spread is for the merchant. In Bitcoin land, the conversion costs are passed on to the customer, and surprisingly bitcoiners are happy to pay for the costs.  
If you use BitPay, when someone donates $10 in BTC, Wikipedia will receive $10 no matter what.  All conversion/exchange costs are passed onto the customer and that is reflected in the exchange rate they see on the page when they confirm the payment.
I would contact BitPay as well as coinbase and see what they both have to offer you.

Yes. Societies a right to self-determination.  If they are evil, then they will be viewed as so.  I suppose you've never heard of the concept of moral relativism?  You should study it.
There are a million hypotheticals you could view as taboo. Yet, it can be said with certainty that modern societies have decided that laws should be enforced by a public entity who has a monopoly on violence.
You're welcome to have a different opinion, and would probably enjoy a wine and cheese party with rothbard and friedman.  But outside of fringe youtube videos, subreddits, and anarchist forums,  most of society disagrees with you.  
To call them violent and evil because they disagree with you is simply an ad hominem attack.  If you really care about convincing society that violence should be privatized, write a white paper on the pros and cons and submit it for peer review by political and social scientists.

The goal of your company is that your sidechain will be more popular then the main chain.  Eventually all BTC will be pegged to it. Then "Bitcoin" becomes the sidechain, which is now controlled by a for-profit company, run by CEO Austin Hill.  Attemps to merge sidechain code into Bitcoin Core will not be ACK'd by members of Blockstream, because they'll want a monopoly on the feature set.

I'm asking questions and writing my own personal opinions.   If I'm wrong about something please let me know. Reddit is a discussion forum... people ask questions and others reply.


There are reasons that this community is very skeptical about new businesses / alt-coins.  Here are some of them:  Bitcoin Savings and Trust, Mt. Gox, Moolah, Neo &amp; Bee, BFL Labs, multiple pump and dump alt-coins, cloudhashing services that don't actually have the hardware, and the list goes on.  These things cost the community *hundreds of millions of dollars* in theft/fraud.   If you didn't know this before, I can understand why you'd feel the way you do.  If you did know this, then its just unrealistic for you to think that people won't want to know about the people behind a new business or alt-coin/sidechain, etc.  
Don't take it personally if you're faced with skepticism, people just want questions answered.  Perhaps I am harsher with my criticsim or skepticism then others ( I've seen people burned time and time again with the things above when all the warning signs were there, even after warning them).  But, I'm also quick to throw my support behind a project once it's clear that it's being run legitimately.  Vitalik has endorsed this project, and that's a good sign.
Let me be clear how this particular post came across to me and why I posted my skepticism:  
1- The title made an outlandish claim that Truthcoin will 'Replace' almost all the major Bitcoin 2.0 projects.  2- After looking at a few accounts posting, I noticed they only (or overhwhelmigly) posted on truthcoin related posts.  3- The way they replied to comments seemed to me like they were marketing for truthcoin. They said that you're not selling anything, but initial-coin-allocations.pdf says that VTC will be sold off in Auctions. So, this seems like they're marketing some sort of sale  4- The first thing I looked at was the pitch deck, which looked haphazardly put together and frankly (again my opinion, don't take this personally) didn't really describe the problem and solution very well. It also had logos from 2 universities without explaining what those universities had to do with the project.  
Given that this was my initial impression, I quickly posted my opinions.  There was no intention for any misinformation, so if there is some, please let me know. 


Good question. Thats why I was wondering why these people are promoting your project with brand new accounts? (i.e. who are they and what do they have to gain?)


This is good to know! You should mention that in the pitch deck, and other relevant places.


I want to make it very clear I am not claiming that you're fraudulent misrepresenting yourself as having the degrees you mentioned.  I *asked* why the logos of the schools were on the pitch deck. (i.e. Are the schools affiliated with the project, or did you receive degrees from them?).  I'm sorry if you interpreted it otherwise.


I deleted the other posts and here they are:
1) How is the sale of VTC going to occur? initial-coin-allocations.pdf mentions some sort of auction. Can you be more specific?  i.e. How many VTC will exist, and how many will be sold in the auction?
2) (You answered this question regarding the university logos in the pitch deck). Thanks.
3) Do you agree with OP's notion that Truthcoin will replace the things it mentions?
4) I thought your pitch deck was confusing and not straight to the point... would you like some help rewriting it? I'd be happy to provide feedback and send you an updated version.
FYI I'm a huge fan of PM's.  If one can successfully be implemented on a decentralized platform it would be a killer app.

This is a direct link to the appropriate post. Not a tweet. This is also reddit.   Second, this is a serious bug. The title of the other post is not indicative of the actual problem.  Third, if we can have 10 posts about western union or the price going to the moon, call me crazy, but I **THINK** it should be alright for *code issues in Bitcoin Core* to perhaps have more visibility.  To downvote this because you think that there's already a post discussing this (which actually isn't the case since the other post is more general and about refactoring risks) shows that you have more concern from what you see on the front page then the actual security of Bitcoin.  Time to check your priorities.
EDIT: Not a bug depending on peoples personal/different definitions of bugs.  Just code changes that would have caused problems merging in CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY if they weren't fixed.

I'm confused...  If you disagree with my notion that people to might want to know who's behind Truthcoin, why did you put your name to it?  I would also disagree with comparing yourself to Satoshi because you're *selling* something from which you stand to a personal financial gain, and you're not anonymous.  
Anytime someone is selling something in this space, people are going to be skeptical because of the plethora of scams and alt-coin pump and dumps that have occurred over the past few years.   You really shouldn't take it personally.  (i.e. avoid coming across as sort of special person who's papers or track record should be immune to any sort of scrutiny or people will think you'll full of hubris.)


I know one of the reasons you mention is because "people like misinterpret it as an altcoin". This is why Q&amp;A, voting, and AmA's exist. You're a statistics guy... Work out the cost/benefit of a) ignoring the most important crypto-currency forum because one guy might be skeptical or misinterpret something and you'll feel personally insulted  or b) just answering their questions to clear things up, and continue to use Reddit for the obvious benefits.


Good question.  The slide says "TEAM".  Here are some possible interpretations:  Are they on the team? Are they funding research? Are they invested in Votecoins?  Have they endorsed it? yale is a prestigious institution. If you're selling something and that logo is on your team page, you should make sure there are zero ways to misinterpret why it's there.


That would be the plan, I'm in the startup space and have done my fair share of pitch decks. I'll spend some time on it later this week. I think PM's are powerful tools, so I'm happy to help if possible.    I can understand when you put a lot of work into something how it might feel if people misinterpret things, so I'm sorry if you felt upset by any skepticism.  This community has been through a lot scams, so you'll definitely find they they're quick to scrutinize anyone selling anything.  Don't take it personally... just answer questions, and if it's a good idea, you'll find people will quickly support it.

Greg,  It's great that you proposed the side chains concept first.
There are a dozen co-founders of Blockstream. But Austin Hill is the majority equity holder. He stands to make a majority of the money from your hard work, and is also CEO. 
Ultimately, if you guys do an awesome job, and 100% of BTC move over to your sidechain, Austin Hill is running the show.   Even if you have a disagreement and leave, he will just hire new talent, and continue with his monopoly on Bitcoin development.
For such a bright group of guys, I'm not sure why its so hard for you and other team members to dismiss this conflict of interest as a non issue.
@_date: 2014-10-23 06:27:54
Your statement actually says nothing.  Worse, you fail to mention your business intentions and strategy for generating revenue. Do you have something to hide?
If nobody uses your sidechain, you have failed.  If everybody uses your sidechain, you are a for-profit company run by CEO Austin Hill now controls bitcoin devleopment.
2 out of 5 of the Bitcoin Core maintainers are you founders.  There is a conflict of interest.  They should step down.  Ask yourself this question: Would it be alright if Gavin Andresen started working for Ethereum?

Here is how you can help fix the problem:
1) Move your hashpower to  - 0% fee P2Pool
2) Lobby the Bitcoin Foundation to release a statement encouraging everyone to switch to P2Pools as soon as possible. The fact that gavin failed to mention that in his post is a perfect example of his (and the Foundation's) inability to lead.
3)Lobby the core devs to implement Peter Todd's treechains

There's no turning over anything. It's just contract law.  
It doesn't matter if the contract uses 'colored coins' to do the accounting for the tokens, or the company's own internal servers (which airlines use to store airmiles).  The fact that the accounting is done on the block-chain is irrelevant to how contract law works.  The judge doesn't rule based on the accounting mechanism, the judge rules based on the contract language.

When used in this sense, anarchy may or may not be intended to imply political disorder or lawlessness within a society.

Blockstream is a for-profit company and its goal is to develop a feature-rich side chain. At *least* 3 core devs are founders, 2 of whom are maintainers (out of 5). The goal of the sidechain is to be feature rich, so that people will want to peg their BTC to it.  If the goal is 100% achieved, all BTC will be moved to your sidechain.  You will then control development of network where all BTC lives.  This puts Blockstream in direct competition with Bitcoin. These core devs are now incentivized to make changes to the Bitcoin protocol that would benefit them financially. Blockstream is run by CEO Austin Hill.
Given the obvious conflict of interest, will these core devs immediately give up commit access to the Bitcoin github code?

A perfectly efficient form of money should have NO INTRINSIC value.  Intrinsic value is a bad thing for money.  If something has intrinsic value, it means it can be consumed for something other then being used as a store of value.  This is bad because it means the supply is not stable.

Exactly. What is the financial benefit?  What is Blockstream's revenue model?  Clearly it will have something to do with people moving coins onto their sidechain. 


If 51% of BTC are moved to the sidechain, Blockstream *becomes* Bitcoin.  


No.  The problem is they are financially incentivized in some way (not exactly clear because Blockstream wont say what its revenue model is) to have people move their coins onto the sidechain.  This means they may (not to say they will, but the possibility that they can is conflict of interest) make commit decisions which are beneficial to the sidechain, and which are detrimental to the main chain (in order to make sure the side chain still has a competitive advantage.)

1) not changing goalposts, just stating facts.
2) if a society decided to kill people of a certain race, then it would be viewed by reasonable outsiders as an evil society.  
Our society, (as is the case in much of the world), has decided to give public institutions a monopoly on violence.  Are those institutions sometimes corrupt? Of course, thats human nature.  But there are more checks and balances this way.  
There's a reason why we don't have private companies enforcing laws.  Most reasonable people think its a bad idea.  Ancaps simply haven't put forward a convincing argument to the rest of society.

1) Move your hashpower to  - 0% fee P2Pool
2) Lobby the Bitcoin Foundation to release a statement encouraging everyone to switch to P2Pools as soon as possible. The fact that gavin failed to mention that in his post is a perfect example of his (and the Foundation's) inability to lead.
3)Lobby the core devs to implement Peter Todd's treechains
Do these things if you want to help the network.

There's no way to do SPV with Counterparty... say goodbye to any mobile usage.
Given that ethereum will have more functionality then Counterparty, do SPV, have a larger community, a better PoW, a faster and better blockchain, It will trade at, or higher, then counterpartie's market cap.
This is a total FUD campaign by Counterparty and is buying right into it.  That being said, Ethereum is going to have to really speed things up and push that launch window forward.

Open-source projects have something called 'maintainers'. These are people who decide what pull requests are merged on github and what goes into the code. 2 of the 5 Bitcoin Core maintainers now work for Austin Hill. If everyone pegs their BTC to the sidechain, it will have a network effect. Bitcoin will die and the sidechain will become Bitcoin2.  
At that point, Blockstream, a for-profit company, will decide what Bitcoin2 becomes, since they will be the only maintainers/commiters.  You'd be able to fork and use your their code, but you couldn't decide what goes in it.

POS means point-of-sale. POS does not define what device is required to achieve the sale, only that there is some hardware.  Therefore, the hardware can be a $25 android tablet with a blockchain.info wallet open on it. And you have a POS system.   Infact, you can even use BitPay and have your BTC converted into Fiat if you'd like. CoinKite does not offer this service.
Infact, your $25 POS tablet can also use any other free Andriod Bitcoin wallet.  These wallets can support QR codes and NFC, so you can swipe any NFC device ! Yes, you can swipe!!

Bitcoin is a debit system by default. You can't extend credit in bitcoin.
When people think of debit cards, they think of plastic that they can use at ATM's and merchants on the traditional systems.  
For example, a Paypal DEBIT CARD lets you interact with your paypal account balance by withdrawing money from ATMs using your Paypal debit card and having that amount deducted from your paypal balance.
This is what people think of when they think about debit cards. It doesn't matter if CoinKite's Access Card could semantically be described as a debit card.  The fact is that you, I, and CoinKite all know that when people think of any payment processor (Paypal, etc) associated with a Debit card, they think of being able to use that Debit Card in the traditional sense.  By coinkite calling their access card a Bitcoin Debit Card, they are misleading the common public into thinking that they can use them at ATMs.  Don't take my word for it, go read their posts and look at the confusion.  It's a marketing gimmick. And its working.

It shows a large amount of coins (likely) coming out of cold-storage.  The date co-incides right around the time the tx malleability scam was being pulled off.  
Exchanges usually calculate their average daily deposits and withdrawls and leave enough BTC in the hot wallet so that each other cancels out.  But if GOX was being robbed, withdrawals would outweigh deposits very quickly and their hot-wallet would have been emptied. 
This is likely a transaction of Karpeles filling it up again. It's possible Karpeles wasn't even aware of the issue and didn't suspect anything until he was forced to refill the hot wallet and wondered WTF was going on.
Of course, this could just be another whale moving some funds around, but it's just too much of a co-incidence in my opinion not to be a gox wallet transaction.

Misunderstanding of the term 'protocol': check.
It's been said hundreds of times by gavin, greg maxwell, and other core devs:  Bitcoin doesn't have a protocol.  There is only one 'protocol', and that is the Core C++ implementation.  Any other implementations risk hard forking the chain.  Almost every attempt at a full node in another language has run into a consensus problem somewhere.  If 1/2 the network would have adopted those ports, we'd have lots of hard forks. It would be a nightmare.
Finally, What makes you think that having a version flag in messages solves consensus hard forks?

We all know the reason that the buyers purchased the BTC is because they believe in it long term and don't care about short term price fluctuations.  Your comment says 'oh look you could have saved $100k if you bought it 24 hours later', insinuating that they should have waited 24 hours later to save $100,000.  The logic then follows that any purchase is bad unless you buy at the bottom.


No. This move is par for the course -- standard bitcoin volatility and nothing out of the ordinary.


I do have an idea. They are accredited, informed, wealthy individuals who are making a binary outcome trade. Either bitcoin is worth $0 or it is much higher then it is today.  The possibility of losing 100% is already factored into the their purchase, so there is no 'loss of confidence' price that will cause them to sell short of Bitcoin catastrophically failing.
EDIT: Here's the reason the price dropped.  It had nothing to do with the auction.

The fact that Vitalik can ingest the entire counterparty protocol and re-implement it in a single day is extremely impressive.  For people who were on the counterparty circlejerk wagon yesterday, you should know that BTC will be able to interact with Ethereum contracts. (They've outlined their plans for this multiple times).  Ethereum is not a threat to Bitcoin, but simply a welcome addition to the cryptocurrency space.  Ethers are just used to pay for gas in contracts. If you're worried about them replacing Bitcoin as a store of value, I'd say that the network effect Bitcoin has is very hard to break.

a) Taxes aren't a bad thing. even the founding fathers and tea partiers wanted to pay taxes, they just wanted representation in parliament for doing so.   Taxes that are **mis-spent and wasted** are a bad thing.
b)The system isn't 'rigged' against accumulating wealth. Just ask elon musk or jan koum (who went from being poor to selling WhatsApp for $18 billion).   However, the ability to inflate currency is a BAD thing if used improperly.
c) true in some sense. there are reasons for housing community regulations -- go to india and see what kind of unsanitary conditions you can live in without regulations.
d) capitalism is for everyone, socialism is a result of FIAT currency. Welfare as it exists today wouldn't be possible on a gold standard.
e) 1st amendment in america, everyone is against surveillance without a warrant, patents and copyright are very important -- without them why would i spend capital on R&amp;D when I know someone else will copy my product?  This is particularly important in drug research.  Developing a drug can cost $1 Billion, but only $10 to copy it.  Without patents there would be no incentive to innovate.  That said, fuck patent trolls and perpetual copyright extentions.
f) Societies all have their own right to self-detemination. If they want to have a border to delineate where their laws are upheld, they're within their right to do so. Borders have existed since the beginning of time.  In the ancap world, you'd have to pay 1000 tolls to go from point A to point B.  Ultra-local governments are incredible inefficient. I'd rather cross a line and know what rules are on the other side of it once every 10,000 miles, instead of once every mile.
g) ancap world would also have a fuckton of protectionism, monopolies, and corrupt corp's. this is a function of human nature, not states.
h) Common fallacy here. Blaming statism on human nature.  In the ancap world, SecurityCorp^TM will have a corrupt CEO.  FairTrailsAndCourts^TM CEO will be involved in a scandal where he was paid off by JailsAreUs^TM's CEO who wanted longer sentences.  **corruption is caused by human nature, not the state.** In todays society corrupt politicians lose their office when they're caught. In ancap world FairTrialsAndCourts^TM CEO will just pay his militia off to defend his property from WeWantJusticeCorp^TM which was formed by angry citizens who didn't like him being corrupt.
i) This is human nature. People work with those in their social circles. The same thing will happen and conglomorates and monopolies form in ancap utopia world.

- Even though it looks unprofessional, if gox is bankrupt they are surely scrambling with lawyers to make a game-plan. No time to make documents look nice.  In a rush like this there will be many spelling errors, etc.
- The document cites the morning of the 25th to announce a Gox shutdown. This happened. 
- The document cites a 'new' service called BitPocket. Only insiders would have known about this. The domain was registered on Feb 10th 
- Another user pointed this out --
"The document also features liabilities that show that Gox has over $160 million in Liability. $55 million in fiat, and over $100 million in BTC. The did a BTC to Fiat conversion so in the court of law, if it came down to it, their liabilities would have to be repaid in fiat. That being said, Gox knew they would be MUCH better off if they had a price for BTC on their exchange at less than $160 per bitcoin, so they did whatever they could to crash their own market to lower their liabilities. They halted trading at $135. They probably could have done more damage to the price, but bitcoinbuilder's arbitrage pressure was pushing the price up to points that they were not happy with. They froze at $135 for a reason.
The way the liabilities section of that document is spelled out and the dropping of the goxBTC price, as well as their freeze point lends more credibility to the document as well."

No.  Stupid people are very good with large numbers.  In fact,  if you asked any stupid person how much money they want, they would say 1 billion dollars.  They would never say 0.0123 Gigabitcoins.  Even though the latter is more money. Why? Because they're stupid. But they sure know that when it comes to money, big numbers are better. 
So, you're simply wrong.  Stupid people know that a gazillion dollars is worth a lot of money, so they want large numbers worth of money. Therefore when it comes to money, stupid people don't have trouble with large numbers. Infact, as far as they are concerned, the larger the number the better.

If you think Paycoin is a scam, then its better that $30,000 has gone to a Bitcoin conference which benefits the community, INSTEAD of given back to the scam.
Paycoin will **not** benefit in any way from this sponsorship. It will be a complete and total disaster for them. Everyone at the conference will be **talking about how much of scam** they are.  They're paying $30,000 to shoot themselves in the foot.
By logic, giving back the $30k is idiotic -- GAW will just use that to pay for more adwords and marketing to rip more people off.  
If you really want Paycoin to go bankrupt, then you should be happy that their marketing budget has just lost $30,000

It's still a track record of fraud.  And perhaps he didn't show up because he was guilty. Generally, people will contest false charges.  I could be wrong here, but this looks like a typical case of "I'm in Japan and never coming back to France. haha."
Your original post that it 'seems' unlikely is only based on what you think logical people would do.  From what we know about Karpeles, he doesn't seem like a very normal person.  
It's entirely possible that he played around with 'house' money and lost it. Either by speculating directly, or 'borrowing' user funds with the intention of returning them later (something that was impossible to do after the price hit $1000).  That would also be fraud.
Of course, its also possible that he has nothing to do with it.  We simply don't know.  I only asked you for clarity because you said it 'seems' which I thought would be based on some sort of objective evidence rather then speculation of what a normal person in his position is likely to do.

Reset back to anarchy and wait long enough and you'll have societies that form states to fill power vacuums.  No amount of technology is going to change our genetic code.

This should be a comedy. They aren't doing Ross a favor here. 
A good documentary on Silk road would interview forward thinkers and discuss the philosophical implications of it's consequences.  (i.e. the silk road reduced violence in society, took drug gangs off the street, made drug use safter for end users, etc.  Ross could be painted a postitive light in the battle against the drug war and for legalization efforts)  Instead this is going to be a "ross is innocent" or  "0mg there might be 5 DPRS Ross is only 1/5th guilty!!1!!!one!1!" conspiracy type film.  Maybe that's sells and entertains, but you'd be a fool to dismiss the evidence that overwhelmingly shows that Ross was DPR.  
IMO, He should have pled guilty and bargained for a reduced sentence, or at lesat contested the legailty of the seizure of the servers.  And his *biggest mistake* was not securing his BTC. The gov't would probably have bargained with him if he pled guilty and paid a $150 million fine. After all, HSBC got 0 years with a $4 Billion fine. On the other hand if the murder for hire charges were real then he might have had a tough time with anything.

Darkwallet is bad for bitcoin.   let me explain why.
Amir's radical extremist rhetoric is used at every turn by the media to paint Bitcoin in a bad light.  Dark Wallet could have been called "Privacy Wallet", and Amir could have framed his arguments within constitutional rights to privacy.  But instead, he uses agressive rhetoric to push his anarchist/communist politics and aim for the 'downfall of the state'.  This is total nonsense and something mainstream society will certainly reject.  
If the goal for most people on this subreddit is for Bitcoin to grow and for society to adopt it, I would strongly suggest donating instead to projects that know how to market themselves properly in a way that is positive for Bitcoin's image.
Furthurmore, if you want 'private' transactions, those are already available with Darkcoin, and will be done effortlessly with Ethereum contracts when they launch in a mere few weeks.

you don't need to quote something if you agree with it.


I know exactly what I'm talking about.
Finally, Bitcoin's aim isn't to subvert the state. It's to allow for private electronic monetary transactions. 
States have existed since the beginning of recorded history perfectly fine with private transactions (Gold), and they will continue to do so with private electronic transactions (Digitial Gold; Bitcoin).  If you think Bitcoin spells the end of countries, you're the one who hasn't studied history, and doesn't know what they're talking about.
But if it makes you f33l lik3 a "l33t hax0r r3b3l" every time you use Bitcoin, then go for it!!  Thats why Bitcoin is so interesting. It doesn't matter what sort of nonsense political ideaology you subscribe to....  Statists, communitsts, facists, democratists, anarchsists, all love it!

PSA2: Numbers are used to seperate points for visual clarity.  
PSA3:  The question is about him personally, its not an ad-hominem attack if i'm outlining why people don't like him. The whole purpose of the response is to discuss his character.  Nothing I said above is false.  As for firing squads -- yes, political extremeists (communists and facists) -- usually kill their political oppoents once they've acquired enough power.  Given his agressive politics, I wouldn't be surprised if he would jump to violence if he could.
Try having a conversation with Amir one day. He'll rail on about how terrible western society is and the Iraq war.   (Since he's against the Iraq war, it makes him a good person. And since he's a good person, its means his views on anarchy are correct, and everyone else who disagrees can fuck off.)
Why? Because it's cheap strawman demagoging used to promote his anarchocommunist politics.  It's not different then Muslims in the UK who support ISIS and Sharia law  because "Western society is responsible for girls being raped".   According to ISIS the world would be saved under sharia law.  According to Amir the world would be saved by anarchy or communisim.
They're two sides of the same extremist bullshit.

0. "Some" people dislike him?  Try Most people dislike him and don't want to associate with him.  The people who like him are the anarchist fringe who used to make up a large portion of early Bitcoin adopters, (who are now being drowned out by the sane, moderate, and mainstream members of society adopting Bitcoin).   He's not 'important' -- whatever that is supposed to mean.  Bitcoin would be just as fine whether or not he was invovled.  He's an average coder, who is vastly surpassed in skill and knowledge by most of the Core Devs. He could have contributed postively to the community and respected people who have different political opinions to him, but he's doesn't. He's impossible to deal with, just read most of his posts. 
1. Amir is an attention seeking idiot. He leaked Bitcoinica code with the API keys for the bitcoinica MTGOX account still in them.  Someone used those keys to steal all the BTC from GOX.   Many people suspect Amir himself stole the funds and used the leak as a 'oops sorry about that I don't know who stole the money' cover.   He's either incompetent or a theif.   
2. He thinks he's such a l33t hax0r with his 'Dark' this and 'Dark' that.  Anyone with a brain just sees it as idiotic marketing that harms Bitcoins image.  Darkwallet could be called PrivacyWallet and spun positively, but nooooooooo.  He has a cult of personality around him in the squats he stays in, generally uses the whole 'sticking it to the man' to impress girls and naive n00bs who want to feel like they're part of some sort of anarchic revolution.  But, alas, I suppose it's logical that a broke communist/anarchist living in squats with a grudge against society wants to see it all burn. 
3. He's not important.  Everything he's building now will be replaced by Ethereum DApps with no person or politics behind them.  He will likely fade into obsurity and hang out in his squats and make some l33t hax0r videos and posts, but will ultimately change nothing -- because society simply doesn't want to watch itself burn like he does.  Radicals extremists like Amir are always very passionate about their beliefs, but equally misguided in their thinking and actions. They're also usually the types that are quick to put their political opponents infront of the firing squads.  
TL;DR Amir leaked Bitcoinica code that resulted in 40,000 BTC being stolen.  He has radical extremist views which are consistently used as cannon fodder by the mainstream media.  The BBC does interviews with him specifically when they want to make Bitcoin look bad.   I hope he'll change his tune some day and calm the fuck down.

No.  Citizens have a right to privacy.


Yes, it could.  And SSL, and SSH, and citizens right to privacy.  I think its a political non-starter to actually pass that bill.  It's also impossible to enforce.  It would be like banning swearing.


Not sure yet.  Drug markets like the Silk Road reduce violence, so they're probably a net benefit.  People should be able to do whatever their want to their own bodies as long as its not harming anyone else, and face the consequences for their actions -- Darwin will see their genes removed from the pool.
Markets that advocate violence, i.e. assasination markets, etc. thats a tough question... we'll have to see what happens.  Either way, good old detective work and social engineering will still be able to arrest criminals who operate in these markets. So, its not like society will be destroyed just because people are paying others to be violent, this has been happening since the beginning of time

Inputs into your disposable wallet are connected to the outputs of your other wallets.  When you sell on localbitcoin, there is a record of the people you transact with.  If you sell them a stolen coin and they are audited the conversation will go like this.
"Yeah, i met btcner from localbitcoins. His email address was X, his phone number was Y, we met in location Z.  He sold me this stolen bitcoin"  This is enough information to determine your identity and then use BitIodine to perform a statistical analysis on which wallets you control.

Think about a future where the US legalizes and taxes bitcoin transactions, and the US treasury becomes the largest holder of bitcoins (worth trillions in todays $), while all the FIAT currencies around the world trend to zero. 
The US will be able to continue to build its military while the other countries will have FIAT with no buying power. Why? Because the US government embraced bitcoin. I'm VERY happy that its not the other way around.
If you don't like America, free speech, and human rights, perhaps you should redirect your rage elsewhere.  Otherwise, you should be happy with the idea of the US embracing Bitcoin innovation, and holding Bitcoin in Treasury.

SI symmetry is not required for a currency.  There is no difficulty of converting to bitcoins.  Nobody will transact in bitcoins when the price is so high that we have to subdivide a satoshi.  Your logic is absurdly flawed.

1)  Pools have come close to 50% many times in the past.  Miners leave them when this happens.  This has shown to be true time and time again and there is nothing to expect this to be otherwise in the future.
2) Theres nothing wrong with capital moving away from bitcoin to a better crypto-currency. Infact, that is what's supposed to happen in a free market.  Obviously as of now your concern is a non-issue.  The market believes it's a non-issue or bitcoiners would already have moved to a different coins such a PoS based coin.

Wrong. First, you need to recognize that the miner does 1 thing only - make bitcoins. 
1) If you can buy more BTC now with your 2k then the miner will ever make, it is stupid to buy the miner.
2) If the miner will make more BTC then you can buy now with 2k, then its smarter to buy the miner.
Unfortunately. With the current rate of difficulty increase,  will be the case.
EDIT: Not a single ASIC manufacturer has met shipping targets.  You will probably get the unit in November.  Difficulty will probably be 250MM+ by then.  It might even arrive later, and this will never ROI. you should just buy BTC instead and buy Difficulty Futures with them

@_date: 2013-09-15 22:56:17
People need to STOP using fiat exchange rates to calculate mining profitability. Doesn't matter if you use USD/EUR/YEN/POUNDS.
Think about what you're actually doing when you buy a mining device. You are buying a machine that does one thing and one thing ONLY, it makes bitcoins. Infact, for all intents and purposes, it only makes a finite amount of bitcoins.
If you are smart, you can calculate how many bitcoins your miner is likely to ever make. If you buy a miner for 100BTC, and it only mines 90BTC, then you have lost 10BTC.
Now heres the trick that manufacturers do to rip off the uninformed. They have calculated that the miner will only make 90BTC, so instead of plugging it in and running it for a year or so, they try to sell you the miner for 100BTC! Not only do they get 10BTC more, but they get their return right away. (The time value of money is also valuable)
So instead of selling the miner to you at 100BTC, they just say '$10,000' (assuming the exchange rate was $100/btc). This tricks most people into trying to worry about what the future exchange rate is. But its actually irrelevant!
Why? Because with your $10,000 you could buy 100BTC right now on an exchange, instead of buying a miner that will only return 90BTC to you. So, you're effectively paying $10,000/90 = $111 per BTC instead of $100 per BTC. You just got ripped off.
When you buy a miner that does not ROI in BTC terms, you are basically paying a higher exchange rate then you can get today on MTGOX.
Another way to look at is, is imagine that I tell you to send me 100BTC or $10,000, and in return i'll give you 90BTC back. Only an idiot would say "don't worry, even though i got 90BTC back, i'll make up for it when the exchange rate goes up! " You're still missing out on 10BTC that you would have if you just bought on MTGOX!

see how i said in the future?  want to know why?  because right now they are able to sell the hardware for more BTC then it will return.
in the future when consumers get smart and refuse to get ripped off, they'll have to mine for themselves to maximize profit.  people overpaying for ASIC hardware now are just speeding up that process.

I can understand if you're unhappy with the idea of the US leading bitcoin innovation.  Think about the future when the US legalizes and taxes bitcoin transactions, and treasury holds bitcoins worth trillions while all the FIAT currencies around the world trend to zero.   The US will be able to continue to build its military while the other countries will fade into oblivion.  Why? Because the US government embraced bitcoin.   I'm VERY happy that its not the other way around.

The price in BTCC is a less accurate indicator of the true worldwide market value, since it can no longer operate as a useful exchange.

ALWAYS meet in a bank when you're doing a large cash transaction.  Banks have cameras and security, and the police are very likely to catch someone who pulls a gun on you in a bank.   Also, thieves won't bother meeting you at all if you want to meet in a bank.  Another positive is that if you're selling BTC, you can have the bank validate the bills right away on deposit to prevent fraud. If everything checks out you send them the BTC.  Very safe. Use Banks.

Nobody should feel sorry for the person who lost the 200 BTC.
They are laundering it, and the 200BTC was returned to another address and they have have well over 10,000 BTC.
Friedcat should have kept the funds as a fiduciary obligation to shareholders. 
It's healthy for this to be made an example of only because of how many BTC this person has. If an honest person who had 100BTC and lost 2BTC (which I would like to see refunded) in a mistake like this, nobody would have noticed, and friedcat wouldn't have wasted his time looking into it.
The fact that a likely criminal with over 10,000BTC got his money refunded, shows that the Bitcoin community will reward the rich money launderers, and ignore the small honest users.

People always ask "Why would mining companies sell hardware instead of mine themselves".  The answer is that the mining companies have figured out there are so many uninformed buyers, and they can sell the miners for more BTC then they will generate. 
It's smart not to buy a ASIC unit until they are in stock and can ship to you within 24 hours.  If thats the case, you can quickly do the math and see if its worth buying.  Otherwise, all these people buying ASIC units expecting shipping 2-3-4 months away are purely gambling.
Just spend $1250 and buy 10BTC.  It will be worth $10,000 within a year or two.

Short version for those who don't want to read the forums:
'mechs', one of the largest just-dice investors lost about 25% (500BTC) of his 2,200BTC investment to nakowa. After complaining all over the forums, asking dooglus to drop the max profit, raise house edge, max out investment, add invest/divest delays, he finally had enough and withdrew all his BTC.  
**Cue drama.**




He accidentally withdrew 1,700BTC to to a paper wallet address that he threw in the garbage a few days before.
Cue panic.  The chat room explodes and people start vomiting everywhere.  Disbelief that 1,700BTC might be lost forever.
Then, hours later.






Cue insanity.  
Something strange must have happened in that dumpster.  We may never know what was going through mechs head.  Weeks of watching his investment wither away, and then 2 hours searching through the garbage for that private key. Thinking he lost 1/4 million dollars... Something must have snapped. 
*He deposits the 1,700 back on just-dice, changes his name to 'fuckit', and...*

So, a terminal is nearly $1000, then a yearly fee of $300. If you want your private key you have to pay 0.5BTC (currently $400.)  On top of this, it's up to the merchant to convert BTC to FIAT for himself. 
Not sure why someone wouldn't just buy a $100 tablet and accept their own BTC with Bitpay and get fiat in their bank?  
What am I missing here?

There is no need to remove the need for a smart device. Smart devices are vastly superior. My smartphone generates a new address for each person sending me BTC and protects my privacy, this card doesn't. People can easily see your balance. 
This card can ONLY be used on CoinKite POS systems. You can't use it anywhere else, not at ATMs or anywhere. They're trying to create a closed proprietary ecosystem so they can profit. But they're not offering any benefits except for claiming to keep your coins safer then you can can on your own.
I can check my balance at any time on my smartphone. I can check the exchange rate at any time on my smartphone. A debit card tells me nothing.  How do I know what exchange rate the CoinKite retailer is charging me?  Can I be sure its a fair rate?  I better check my smartphone.  Oh, thats right, I'm going to use my smartphone anyway, I don't need a debit card.
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:02:20
Yes, its acutally a 'CoinKite Access Card'.

Even though you are simply a troll who lacks any ability to engage in useful discourse without shouting sarcasms and leveling attacks, I will nevertheless respond to your nonsense for the sake of the good of the community.
Lets analyze your response, and see how silly you are.


I never said it wasn't.  You are the common type of troll who seems to reads and infers imaginary things.


There is no way to protect against it. Just as there is no way to protect against someone robbing your store with a gun.  However, there are legal consequences of doing so.  Your sarcastic dismissal is nonsense. You can take precautions such as waiting for confirmations, just as a store owner can install bullet-proof glass, and multiple doors with timed interlocks. It's simply a matter of economics.


Obviously. Just as it's better to prevent violent robberies of convenience stores rather then hoping the state will discourage it with consequences.  
If you are able to modify the bitcoin codebase so that all transactions are instantly confirmed without proof-of-work blocks and while simultaneously solving the byzantine generals problem, we'd love to pull your code into the master branch.  Satoshi couldn't figure it out. We're waiting for you to enlighten us with your brilliant solution.

Seems like some of you are confused. These can't be used at an ATM or any other POS. Only coinkite POS terminals.

Good. This means the US is more likely to be the leader in Bitcoin innovation.
Hopefully the US treasury will hold a large portion of Bitcoin in the future, so that the greenback can still function as the worlds reserve currency.  Can you imagine if China held the most Bitcoins in the future when they are worth trillions?
The US would have a hard time keeping the military budget going with useless greenbacks unless they have a large amount of Bitcoin in treasury.  This is a step forward for the US and a step back for China.

No. Because you'd have more BTC if you bought BTC at todays exchange rate instead of buying the miner.
lets assume the exchange rate is $100 today (and goes to $1000 in the future)
lets say the miner costs 100BTC. *but* because difficulty rises, it only returns 50BTC in profit.
-- if you buy the miner, you will get 50BTC back which in the future is worth $50,000 
-- if you buy bitcoins on MTGOX today, you will get 100BTC which in the future is worth $100,000
in the first scenario you paid $10,000 to get 50BTC which is $200/coin
in the second scenario you paid $10,000 to get 100BTC which is $100/coin

For every buyer there is a seller.  I'll happily buy more coins at a lower price.  Then the coins are in stronger hands.  The price quickly recovers and goes higher.
Large sells are nothing but a buying opportunity.

It's not difficult for merchants like BitPay to plug in LTC support.
Litecoin is also attractive because:
- 2.5 Minute blocks (4x faster)
- It's 'cheaper' (people are idiots and think they will buy at $30 and it will go to $1000 like bicoin)
- Its (currently) ASIC resistant.
I wonder if the bitcoin devs will hard-fork bitcoin to change the block time and PoW if LTC ever grows larger?

This is the first time an alt-chain has posed a potential threat to Bitcoin. Chinese exchanges are all adding LTC. Chinese think its cheaper and will go to $1000 like Bitcoin. They don't realize that LTC has 4x more coin.  Even if it goes to 1/4 Bitcoin, that means that Fiat starts flowing to both coins *evenly*. 
Laugh all you want, but I think a serious discussion is warranted.  I warn you all, to say 'lol litecoin is a bubble' is just like the Fiat holders who said 'lol bitcoin is a bubble'.

Nobody should feel sorry for the person who lost the 200 BTC.
They are laundering it, and the 200BTC was returned to another address and they have have well over 10,000 BTC. 
It's healthy for this to be made an example of only because of how many BTC this person has. If an honest person who had 100BTC and lost 2BTC (which I would like to see refunded) in a mistake like this, nobody would have noticed, and friedcat wouldn't have wasted his time looking into it.
The fact that a likely criminal with over 10,000BTC got his money refunded, shows that the Bitcoin community will reward the rich money launderers, and ignore the small honest users.

You're wrong.  Price goes up because people know that difficulty is going to increase because mining companies have announced they will ship future hashpower.
Price follows futurehashpower announcements.  This is because people know the difficulty will rise.  The difficulty does NOT rise because the price rose,  the price rose because the market saw that futurehashpower was ordered which means the difficulty will rise.

In the current atmosphere, there is no useful pricing information to absorb from BTCChina.  It is simply fear and speculation.  The country is run by dictators who at any time may or may not change their stance on Bitcoin. The efficient market hypothesis cannot assumed to be true under such an environment.  If the market is not efficient, pricing cannot be assume to be the true value.  Therefore, a more accurate true price would be quoted at a fully functioning and efficient exchange with significant liquidity.
My proposal was simply a suggestion that the truest price is no longer on a non-functioning chinese exchange, and therefore they should not be referenced as such.  This is not such a hard concept to grasp.

The total 'coins' or 'units' or 'satoshis' is 2.1 Quadrillion. (2,100 Trillion).  
Satoshi arbitrarily chose that 100,000,000 of these coins would be called a 'Bitcoin'.  Probably so that early adopters didn't have to deal with transactions invovling hundreds of billions of coins at a time.  The early adopters were most important, so it made sense to make life easier for them.  The code itself only deals with satoshis.

Here's some math for everyone reading this thread. It will embarass you, but hopefully you'll side with logic and reason.
100Gh at TGB says you'll earn 1.12BTC this month.
100Gh at BTCINEST.net  says you'll earn 0.17BTC this month. 
There are 3 days left in this month. TGB is off by a factor of 500%.  What a joke. 
100Gh at TGB says you'll earn 1.75BTC in January.
100Gh at BTCINEST.net  (with 20% diff increases) says you'll earn 1.08BTC in January 
*because it CORRECTLY factors* in that the diff will increase twice within the month.  TGB fraudulently assumes the diff will stay the same during that month.
TGB says you will earn 2.87 BTC by the end of january, when the TRUTH is you'll only earn 1.25 BTC by the end of january.
TGB inflates your earnings by almost 100%. It's nothing but a fail in math.

People need to STOP using fiat exchange rates to calculate mining profitability.  Doesn't matter if you use USD/EUR/YEN/POUNDS.
Think about what you're actually doing when you buy a mining device. You are buying a machine that does one thing and one thing ONLY, it makes bitcoins. Infact, for all intents and purposes, it only makes a finite amount of bitcoins.  
If you are smart, you can calculate how many bitcoins your miner is likely to *ever* make.
If you buy a miner for 100BTC, and it only mines 90BTC, then you have lost 10BTC.
Now heres the trick that manufacturers do to rip off idiots.  They have calculated that the miner will only make 90BTC, so instead of plugging it in and running it for a year or so, they try to sell you the miner for 100BTC! Not only do they get 10BTC more, but they get their return right away. (The time value of money is also valuable)
So instead of selling the miner to you at 100BTC, they just say '$10,000'  (assuming the exchange rate was $100/btc).
This tricks most people into trying to worry about what the future exchange rate is. But its actually irrelevant!
Why? Because with your $10,000 you could buy 100BTC *right now* on an exchange, instead of buying a miner that will only return 90BTC to you.  So, you're effectively paying $10,000/90 = $111 per BTC instead of $100 per BTC!
When you buy a miner that does not ROI in BTC terms, you are basically paying a higher exchange rate then you can get today on MTGOX.
Another way to look at is, is imagine that I tell you to send me 100BTC or $10,000, and in return i'll give you 90BTC back.  
Only an idiot would say "don't worry, even though i got 90BTC back, i'll make up for it when the exchange rate goes up! "  You're still missing out on 10BTC that you would have if you just bought on MTGOX!
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:49:06
Your math is wrong.  You obviously used the wrong diff increase %'s.

@_date: 2013-09-15 23:11:36
mining is centralized by the chip foundries.  don't let the manufacturers fool you into thinking that you're 'doing your part'.  80% of the hashrate is controlled by a few players.  the consumers are just lining their pockets if the hardware doesn't ROI.
cointerra/bitfury/asicminer/avalon/etc will all be mining in the future with more hardware then they sell, which means 50% of the network will always be in the hands of the rich and powerful players who can get chips made at foundries. like it or not, bitcoin is on the way to centralization.
if you dont like centralized mining switch to scrypt/gpu blockchains.

Well, then we'll agree to disagree.  I hold that an exchange that doesn't actually allow deposits isn't a real exchange. Therefore prices quoted on such an exchange don't have real value.  Perhaps it has non-real value.  I won't say that it has zero value, since I'm sure someone is extracting some sort of value from it, but it shouldn't be an indicator of real market price.  I suppose our argument is over the definition of word 'real' as used in this context.  This is semantics.

No. You are wrong.
By your logic, every day that there are more casualties in Syria, you should tell to stop posting them.  "Hey, guys just update the thread from yesterday and add another 500 people who were injured in a bomb blast"
This is legitimate news and a big deal for bitcoin. Nakowa might have wagered more today then any casino in history. Including players at Las Vegas or Macau.
This is the kind of story that will get picked up by the New York Times, or other major outlets.
By downvoting you are doing a dis-service to all bitcoiners and the bitcoin community. By downvoting you don't want it to get picked up by major news outlets.
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:50:51
yeah sorry. edited to correct.

Right now you're right.... My question is what is the tipping point that makes them decide otherwise?  $1,000/coin?  $5000? $10,000?

These will not ROI
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:12:38
Wow. You can't read. Never said anything about selling ASIC hardware for a profit.  I said its immoral for manufacturers to sell hardware to consumers that they know will never ROI in btc terms.
They are taking advantage of the misinformed.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:17:53
This is why anyone buying mining rigs from any ASIC company is going to lose BTC.
You'll end up with more BTC buying them on the market instead of a mining rig that mines them.
@_date: 2013-10-28 22:15:59
Fair enough.  Good job answering criticism on the thread by the way.  You handle yourself quite professionally.   
Strange that some redditors here have joined the downvote brigade on any comment critical of your POS terminal.  I thought it was a legitimate question to ask.
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:06:40
You could argue a cent is the base unit, and dollars are 100 base units.   1 Bitcoin is 100 M satoshi.
Perhaps you should advocate using 100 satoshi as a new base unit, rather then microbitcoins as the base unit.   The word 'microbitcoin' should never be used because Bitcoin is not a base unit.
@_date: 2013-10-14 14:21:30
This is awesome.
Too bad I only code in python and php
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:26:10
Base unit should be small not big.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:27:11
You don't know way more about anything. A bank is the safest place to do a bitcoin transaction. 
If you're not meeting in a bank lobby, you're asking to be robbed.

This is NOT a Debit Card.   This is a CoinKite Access Card.   You can't use it as a debit card at real-world retailers or at an ATM.  
You can't use it with any other Bitcoin merchants. It's NOT A DEBIT CARD.
EDIT: LOL at downvotes.  CoinKite must be paying shills well.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:16:49
Again, you're obviously not familiar with how the law works.
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:47:11
Sure, just don't call it a Bitcoin Debit card.  It's a CoinKite Access Card.

1) It's about supporting the network -- No. 3 usb miners do not support the network in any meaningful way. If you want to support the network, run a full bitcoin node. Then you'll be doing something that actaully helps.
2) Novelty factor - OK.
3) A piece of history? Dont think so. 
Only 1 out of your 3 statements is valid.  Therefore , you have been downvoted.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:14:47
And exactly 0 people use currencies in terms of micro-units.   
Billions of people around the world use or have used a currency where it takes 1000's of units to buy a loaf of bread.  Many europeans had currencies like this before the euro.
It would make sense to do what people are familiar with. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:56:35
I'm willing to wager they probably raised funding from a real VC and need to get off this exchange which is likely not properly regulated.

Its real.  This will be a major motion picture.  This guy will become a hero to those against the war on drugs. 
Philosophically, the SR would have made buying drugs safer, and put violent street thugs out of business.
EDIT: I just read the complaint. Looks like he actually tried to hire a hitman to have someone killed who was threatening to blackmail him. If so, the guy is an asshole and not a hero.  
EDIT2:  Looks like the blackmailer and hitmen were trolling SR and got 1,700 BTC out of him.  The blackmailer realized he wasn't going to get anything out of SR, so he came up with the brilliant idea of offering to 'off' himself and it worked. wow.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:15:29
Correct. They no longer have any real value as a price indicator.
"but can only suggest you are more conscientious constructing your assertions if you ever get to university." 
Read that again. If you ever go to university, you might find out why that sentence has very poor grammatical and syntactic structure.  Actually, maybe the Kahn Academy has some online English tutorials. You might want to check them out.
@_date: 2013-09-24 16:33:35
Wow.  Can believe the people complaining about this post.  This is good for bitcoin.  When people find out that a bitcoin site takes more wagers from a single player then most real-world casinos so, they'll flock to bitcoin.
It will be picked up my major news sources.
Of course, people downvoting and complaining are anti-bitcoin and don't want the press.
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:12:33
The invoice told you to send 0.0993 , you sent 0.992.  
This is 100% your fault.  Stop whining about bitcoin.

The site is now showing -5000 BTC profit.  It was +6,500 only a few days ago.
Nakowa also won 4000BTC in july.  Total winnings over 15,000BTC
@_date: 2013-08-29 15:50:07
Obviously you are not a free market libertarian. 
It's healthy for this to be made an example of only because of how many BTC this person has.  If an honest person who had 100BTC and lost 2BTC in a mistake like this, nobody would have noticed, and friedcat wouldn't have wasted his time looking into it. 
The fact that a likely criminal with over 10,000BTC got his money refunded, shows that the Bitcoin community will reward the rich money launderers, and ignore the small honest users.
It's opinions like yours that lead America to being the corrupt country run by the 1%, where the rich are privledged, and the poor are ignored.

Did you use brainwallet?  If so, your passphrase was likely cracked. Looks like they swept correct horse battery staple, and other addresses that they have private keys to.  
They probably didn't even log into blockchain.info
This should be a warning to everyone. DONT USE BRAINWALLETS unless you have memorized a completely random string of words.
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:58:54
It will if the US holds more Bitcoin in treasury then any other state.
States actors will continue to want payment of taxes in their own FIAT (or crypto) currencies in order to control domestic spending.  I really don't see a realistic scenario anytime in the near future (decades) where this changes.  Under this scenario, the USD will still be the strongest FIAT currency, if the US is still the strongest country, and that happens if it has the most buying power , aka a shit-ton of Bitcoins.
So, Holding BTC in treasury will protect the dollar in any scenario where Bitcoins are worth millions and countries continue to demand taxes in domestic fiat currencies.

The genesisblock is a scam calculator because it calculates difficulty in monthly increases INSTEAD of 2016 blocks.
TGB's calculator will tell you that you're making more BTC then you really will.  TGB is totally irresponsible and the reason that people are being ripped off buying mining equipment thinking that they'll ROI.
Use a REAL calculator like btcinvest.net

Fair enough.
It does seem strange that if your balance isn't what you intend to send, blockchain.info sends your full balance anyway. 
I do see how you could have panicked in this particular case though.
@_date: 2013-09-21 15:20:57
Your math is wrong.  The site is up well over 1% in profit.  (Except for one player, nakowa, who has made a small number of large bets, 100-400BTC, and happened to win 8,000BTC)
It's called variance.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:24:29
make sure he backs the wallets up safely and doesn't lose them or have them stolen
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:38:04
You can't, because the math doesn't work out the same.  On the front-end, TGB massively inflates your reward.
Its VERY misleading.
@_date: 2013-09-24 16:30:34
I guess you'll be wrong if nakowa ends up losing.

Arbitrage is risk-free by definition
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:38:31
Almost everyone here thinks bitcoin is going higher. If you think the same, then when you're down, you should be buying more, not selling for a loss.
What are you trying to 'stop loss' anyway? Its not going to zero.  It's a long term investment.  That said don't put all your eggs in one basket.
If you want help. I can explain how you can arbitrage your cash using bitcoin futures on ICBIT.se.  You can make 30% on your $280,000 risk-free in about 3 months.  That will give you $365,000.   A possibly better bet would to just put $100,000 in Bitcoin and don't touch it for 1-2 years. (or sell when you get back to $750,000).  
Then you can give that to your sister which is what she was owed in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:46:35

I can prevent them from paying into a pubkey you control, so you can take 2.5% when they try to spend their coin anywhere outside of your own terminals.
All it takes is a few PSA's.  Seriously, your marketing is totally misleading.
PS. The common term is paying a Bitcoin 'address'. not paying a 'pubkey'.  If you're trying to educate consumers you might want to use the correct terminology.

Sorry, but you are simply wrong.  This has been rehashed countless times in the bitcoin community. The majority consensus is that the smalled unit is 1 satoshi, and a uBTC is called a 'bit'.  You can deny this and reject this fact all you want.
And now end of thread.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:09:31
So that they can hold them for you, and you have to pay 2.5% when you want to spend your own bitcoins, only at merchants that use their POS terminal?
