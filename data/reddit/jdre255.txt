First, "buying like crazy" would suggest an unusual price movement.  Bitcoin has annualized volatility of well over 150%.  So a 13% price move over a couple days is trivial.  It's surprising when bitcoin *doesn't* swing ~15%, and indeed we've had a few months now of unusually muted volatility.  Don't forget that 6 months ago we had a rally over about 90% from 160 to 310.
  But maybe by "buying like crazy" you meant high volume?  No again.  Volume everywhere (including in China) remains muted, and generally below April levels.
I wish the price were spiking massively on high volume.  But it isn't.  It's up slightly on low volume.  Hopefully that will change and your statement will be true in the future.
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:15:43
But that would hurt your case...sentiment is generally a contrarian indicator.  I buy when everyone is talking negative and vice versa.

A lot of people (including the people who got the housing bubble right) mistakenly call lots of bubbles that *aren't* bubbles.  For example, people were calling US equities a bubble in 1992 when they were just starting to price in the massive wealth created by the internet.
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:47:37
No, you forgot the biggest part.  Look up M2 (broad money supply) and you'll see it's increased far less than the monetary base.  That's because the velocity of money collapsed in 2008 and hasn't recovered.  Basically the Fed is printing money, but it's not entering the economy because banks are hoarding it.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:31:49

My point is that your analysis is fine for developed markets, but the issue with bitcoin is that the # of investors next year may be 3x the number at the start of 2014 (just a maybe).  When traders talk about the market being positioned long crude oil or underexposed to equity, they're assuming a relatively fixed playing field; a relatively set body of traders/investors with a relatively set amount of capital.  Bitcoin doesn't fit that bill.  It's possible that over the next year 80% of bitcoin investors will permanently leave the market and simply give up on it.  Or alternatively that 100 super rich people will buy in.  In either of those scenarios, the positioning or opinions of current speculators and whales are completely irrelevant to predicting the future price action.
@_date: 2014-12-26 15:59:51
He distinguishes between productive and unproductive assets.  It's not rocket science.  Like gold, bitcoin produces no good or service, it's better thought of as a commodity or currency, which have expected values of zero in the long-term.

You don't understand the relationship?  Literal ponzi schemes tend to arise in the midst of bubbles and help fuel them, but the connection is even stronger when we use "ponzi scheme" in the metaphorical sense that most people mean it.  Most bubbles are metaphorical ponzi schemes.
@_date: 2014-12-31 15:52:07
I happen to agree.  I own a substantial number of bitcoins and think it's got a 50% chance of really exploding (both in use and price).  My point was just that, so far, the price action fully supports people who said it was a ponzi/bubble in late 2013.

You're arguing that your doge and BTC are basically collectibles, the same way someone might buy a pretty gold coin with no concern for the resale value.  Fine.  You're a very rare exception.  The vast majority of crypto holders would not hold if they knew for sure that 1. they can sell now for substantial money, and 2. in a year the resale value will be zero.  Not saying the value will fall, just that almost everyone does actually care about price, even if they don't care about short-term fluctuations.
@_date: 2014-12-21 15:57:02
1. Things are worth whatever they can buy.  
2.  QE refers to the federal reserve buying treasury bonds and mortgage securities from banks.  QE actually offloaded a lot of the risk and capital from banks and gave them cash.  Banks have more cash than ever before and less derivative exposure than they've had in 10+ years.

Or...maybe my previous post was a lie.  Maybe I am actually an employee of Mastercard and Russia and Wall Street.  They pay me $200 per negative post on bitcoin.  Every time I post something negative, people read my post and sell BTC.  Just a few hundred more posts and BTC will be worth zero.

@_date: 2014-12-17 17:10:55
Holding BTC and doge is speculation.  You could instead convert it into fiat immediately.  The price of whatever you want to buy is set in fiat.  If BTC and doge collapse to near zero, it will cost many more of them to buy the same goods.  By choosing not to convert into fiat (and thus effectively into the goods you'll eventually want to buy), you're speculating on the value of BTC and doge in the interim.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:09:40
Well articulated.  You're right.  I oversimplified, but I think my interpretation nails the market action.  People who buy bitcoin for non-speculative purposes have no market impact.  If someone buys bitcoins to buy drugs, then buys the drugs, the drug seller than converts the bitcoins back into Fiat quickly, so there's no meaningful market impact.  And yes, "speculation" can mean many different things with different market effects.  We can differentiate the very short-term trader from the buy &amp; holder.  I was mostly attacking the idea that price is mostly driven by the short-term speculators.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:25:24
Agreed, but that can change unexpectedly.  We have almost no visibility into the big trades.  What seems to be driven by technicals are frequently I think, just "noise" by individual and small groups of buyers and sellers, motivated by random things like wanting to buy a house or invest their bonus, or by local "news" like currency troubles in Argentina or Russia or China, etc.
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:43:14

@_date: 2014-12-17 15:50:51
Speculators and technical analysis only fill in the cracks when real supply/demand fundamentals are quiet.  Beyond the short-term, price is driven by basic supply and demand.  A sell off can just be a rich early adopter liquidating their holdings, and a rally can just be a group of rich people shifting 1% of their wealth into BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:05:11
If you use your computer, it's a productive asset.  Similarly, an investment in a stock is literal ownership in a company that makes products/services and generates profits.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a commodity or currency (or both).  Nothing is actually priced in BTC though, so currently it's best thought of as a commodity.  If you use BTC to buy drugs or socks or computers, you can use BTC, but the price of the good is really in USD.  If the BTC/USD rate falls such that BTC is worth $1, you will need many more BTC to buy the same products.  So in this way, BTC is most like, say, gold coins.  The only reason to hold a substantial number of gold coins is as speculation on the value of the coins.  You are betting that the value will rise (in relation to USD or other currencies).  Same with buying BTC.  If goods eventually become priced primarily in BTC, then it will be more like a currency, and then owning them would not necessarily be speculation.

Assuming you mean tech stocks in 2000 and houses in 2007, yes, the former more than the latter.  Tech stocks in 2000 were pretty close to a ponzi scheme because 1. the phenomena was inherently a pyramid with the early buyers only profiting because of later buyers who were guaranteed to lose money since they were buying worthless assets (not all tech stocks were worthless, but a decent % were).  What makes it even more ponzi like was that it wasn't a fixed pool of assets, rather companies and bankers profited from the ponzi by issuing tons of new equity at the inflated prices.

Silk road was 95%+ illegal.  Even the "legal" goods were mostly stolen or counterfeit.
And yes you're right, that silk road number was taken from 2 years.  So, only looking at illegal activity on silk road on an annualized basis, we'd need to say 35%.  Still more than double the USD black market, and of course, there was illegal BTC activity beyond the silk road.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:44:02

@_date: 2014-12-18 21:03:26
Of course I accounted for this you dunce, that's why I did the calculation not in dollar terms but in # of BTC terms.  I initially listed the # of BTC that flowed through Silk Road, so the fluctuating price had no relevance.  Once again, 9500 BTC flowed through Silk Road over 2 years, so even if Silk Road was the only sure of illegal activity for BTC...you can hopefully do the math.

You're probably looking at a logarithmic chart.  Also it's worth noting that the dow sucks...it has hugely underperformed the stock market as a whole.  The S&amp;P isn't really managed; it's a passive index that follows very specific rules determined almost entirely by the size of the companies.

If you find yourself thinking that you understand anything better than the world's leading expert, you are probably falling prey to wishful thinking.  It's important to you to assume that Buffett is misunderstanding something, because otherwise your belief in bitcoin would be wrong.

Nothing particularly funny about it.  Bitcoin has no "fair" value even if we knew for sure that it would succeed.  If bitcoin achieves widespread adoption, should its value be $1000 or $10,000 or $100,000?  There's no right answer.
@_date: 2014-12-26 16:17:53
dow has done phenomenally well vs gold over the last 80 years.  But diversification doesn't mean you match the S&amp;P.  "diversification" is not binary.  Owning 40 stocks is diversified among equities, but if you only own US equities, you're not fully diversified.  US equities have averaged 6% AFTER inflation over the last 100 years.  Far better than gold, or any other commodity or currency. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 05:06:22
"Speculation" isn't dirty.  Idiots just get mad when they don't understand why bitcoin is moving a certain way and blame evil "speculators."  And no, holding fiat is not usually speculation, because it's a currency and taxes must be paid in it, and goods are priced in it.  If you live in Germany, you MUST pay your taxes in euros and the local goods are priced in euros.  You don't much care if the euro falls in price relative to dollars or Yuan because you don't pay your mortgage in Yuan or pay for haircuts in dollars.  Holding a fiat currency outside of what you buy products and pay taxes in, is indeed speculation.  This is true even for tiny currencies of tiny countries.  Nothing is priced in BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-29 15:05:40
My point is that you would be saying the exact same thing if this had happened at $200 or $400.  So yes, $300 was clearly psychologically significant (to the people who bought at that price), and is then reinforced as significant to people like you.  But that exact same scenario could have played at higher or lower.  And unless BTC collapsed to zero, it HAD to play out at some price point.
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:39:44
You're off by a factor of about 1000x.

You confused failing to monitor $670 billion with the actual money laundered.  
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:42:44
Simplify.  My initial claim was that a huge number of BTC (and far more than USD in percentage terms) was used for illegal activity.  As evidence I cited that Silk Road had revenue of 9500 BTC over a 2 year period.  Nothing that has come since negates or refutes that basic point or the evidence I provided.  Can we construct an artificial scenario in which the articles you linked to could possibly also be correct?  I doubt it (since it would probably require assuming that 80%+ of the silk road transactions occurred at the absolute lowest BTC price point over that 2 year period).  Regardless, it's not a very useful exercise to see if in some alternative universe we could get the math to work.  The articles were just examples of poor journalism.  I'm not particularly interested in seeing which basic mistake they made; most likely false extrapolation or only counting a small fraction of relevant transactions.

No, the value of something is equal to what you can exchange it for.  We don't need to compare BTC to dollars, we can compare it to goods.  It's easy to create a diversified basket of goods that is worth $10,000 today.  Like, say, a $2000 computer, a couple month's rent, some food, some clothing etc.  Currently it takes about 30 BTC to buy that basket.  If you can buy the same basket with fewer BTC in a year then the value of BTC has gone up.  
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:41:09
The "huge scale" you're referencing is a tiny, tiny, % of bank assets and bank transactions.  For bitcoin on the other hand, money laundering and illegal products represented the majority of all transactions, at least until recently.

"three to six months" makes you think he was claiming 100% that wall street would move into BTC in a "big way" in exactly 90 to 180 days?  First, it was a forward looking prediction of what other people would choose to do.  That's ALWAYS a probabilistic guess.  Second, he was very vague and general on both what the people would do ("big way") and the timing "three to six months."  It's like when a political pundit says, "Clinton is gonna win the next election in a tight race."  We all understand that it's a probabilistic forecast, and the forecaster understands that certainty is not possible.
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:12:37
You're misusing the word "stable" in this context.  If the price of bitcoin rose between 5% and 20% every year, people would view it as stable.  People think of the USD as stable, even though its price routinely fluctuates 10% against other currencies and commodities.  "stable" doesn't mean zero movement, it means relatively small movement and no fear of complete collapse.
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:07:37

Some tiny, tiny minority may view BTC as collectibles, the same way some people will pay $1000 for a $1 bill with 7 zeroes in a row in the serial number.  But for the vast majority, if they knew for sure that BTC would be worth less in a year and two years than it is today, would liquidate most of their holdings.  They don't care about short-term fluctuations, but that doesn't mean they don't care about price at all.

No, as his 4 decades of speaking and writing shows, he doesn't "speak his book."  He frequently compliments competitors to his companies and speaks frankly about the challenges his companies face.  Now, if a large percentage of his wealth was jeopardized by bitcoin you could argue that maybe this is the one exception, that's why I pointed out the $63 billion.  Buffett seems to value honesty over relatively small amounts of money, so I think it's fair to assume his comments on bitcoin reflect his actual views.  If he actually believed in bitcoin, he could simply accumulate a substantial holding.  He could take just 2% of his wealth and buy up 1/4 of all bitcoin in existence (of course it would take a while to accumulate that much and slippage etc etc).

You jumped the shark with your last sentence.  The value of a good is always reflected in its price, rarely the quality.

Why do you think that naysayers of the telephone is evidence *for* bitcoin?  
An idea succeeds or not based on its own merit.  The fact that lots of people say something is a ponzi scheme or a bad idea doesn't mean it's **not** a bad idea.

Agreed, that's why I just used # of coins.  We can just look at the 9.5 million BTC that flowed through Silk Road and compare that to how many BTC were in existence.  Of course, some coins flowed through multiple times, and many other BTC were sitting at never used addresses of the original miners.  So another way (that reaches the same conclusion) is looking at the percentage of coins at silk road addresses relative to the # of coins that moved to other addresses over the same time period.  Any way you dice it, BTC was mostly about Silk Road and gambling in the early years.

A few issues here.  First, even if bitcoin is a massive, unmitigated success, it simply won't completely replace fiat.  I can say that with certainty, because governments will continue doing what they've done for 2000+ years - they'll require that taxes be paid in the money they can print, and they'll pay their workers in the money they can print.  They'll continue to do that for the obvious reasons.  So even if not a single person wants to use government issue fiat, a large percentage of global currency will always remain government issued fiat no matter what.  
   Second, the extant fiat money supply has little to do with world demand.  We can see this by simply looking at a chart of fiat money in existence over the last 10 years.  It has more than QUADRUPLED.  Seriously.  The US money supply increased from about $800 billion in 2006 to $4.4 trillion today.  The Yen is similar, and the Euro is follow suit, a bit later.  Has the demand for money increased 4x since 2008?  Probably not.  Rather, the amount of money is mostly a result of politics in the broad sense.  Markets equilibrate around the amount of money via the mechanisms of inflation/deflation.  If for some bizarre reason the Federal Reserve reduced the money supply to $10 billion, you'd simply see the price of everything collapse to about 1/25 its current price.

If you read his letters to shareholders over 30 years, he always sounds like that.  He's kind of folksy and colloquial.  His basic argument is that there are productive assets and unproductive assets, and bitcoin is the latter, and unproductive assets almost always underperform productive assets in the long-run.  Sure, bitcoin may be the exception, but that requires a whole lot of things to go right.  Alternatively, if you own a diversified basket of productive assets, you'll almost certainly earn good returns.

Not a fallacy.  The fact that you'd call it such suggests you don't understand taxes and the power of fiat.  Everyone in the world **must** use fiat.  If you don't, you go to jail.  Taxes must be paid in fiat.  So when you receive those bitcoins for a house, you have to convert some into USD or Yen or EUR for taxes.  And if you spend some of your new bitcoins to buy a new computer from Dell, even if Dell wants to simply pay their suppliers in bitcoin, they still have to pay their corporate taxes in USD, so more bitcoins get converted.  Then those suppliers who got paid BTC by Dell similarly have to pay taxes, and so some of those BTC get converted into dollars.
Any money that is actually used for commerce will be converted to fiat.

Nah.  This is a common mistake that people keep repeating over and over.  Blockchains have little to do with cryptocurrencies inherently.  The Federal reserve and individual banks are close to implementing blockchains with USD.  A bunch of tech companies are considering using blockchains to encourage communication between household devices.  Heck, western union could implement a blockchain internal to their company for use with existing fiat.  Blockchains don't need miners, they don't need bitcoin.  Miners simply add decentralization.  Libertarians desperately want that, but it's clearly not necessary for implementation.

However and whenever satoshi sold, it would depress the value of bitcoin.  If he did it earlyish, bitcoin would fall relative to the currencies that the BTC receivers would convert it to.  So he buys a house, someone gets BTC then liquidates it for euros.  Alternatively, if BTC replaces the world's monetary system, it would simply be inflationary (and therefore reduce the buying power of BTC).  If he scaled out the sales very gradually over decades the effect could be minimized.

Maybe.  We don't know yet how much electricity/hardware/and engineering time it would take to build a bitcoin infrastructure to make even a dent in the current financial framework.  So far, bitcoin is much *more wasteful.*  The math isn't that hard.  Just take the current electricity usage required to mine and scale it up by the ratio of bitcoin transaction volume compared to Visa, or western union, or any other.  Or scale up the market value to compare it to gold, etc.
@_date: 2015-05-18 22:38:31
There's not much benefit to using a blockchain when inputs and outputs are both centralized.  It's useful when you need to have a bunch of diverse things talking to one another.

Is the market pricing in Satoshi selling?  The probability distribution of bitcoin is so broad it's hard to talk about this without using probabilities.  
As a thought experiment imagine that the current price is "fair", meaning the expected value of purchasing bitcoin today is a reasonable return (say 10%).  Economic theory suggests that the expected return of bitcoin should be tied only to its correlation to public equities (aka undiversifiable risk), so its extreme volatility doesn't entitle investors to unusually high expected returns.  So if this 10% assumption is true, what does that mean?  Most people agree that bitcoin *could* be worth $10,000 in 10 years, that's an annualized return of about 230%.  So the market is implying the probability of that outcome must be extremely low, well under 5%.  So the probability of bitcoin being worth less than $230 in 10 years must be very high, let's say 80%.  Part of that 80% is composed of scenarios where Satoshi sells, maybe only a very small part.  
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:27:12

You do realize you contradict yourself from one sentence to the next right?
Let's play a game.  You've got a beautiful gold necklace.  Can you pay your taxes with it directly?  No.  The government won't accept gold jewelry as payment of tax debt, nor will they even accept gold coins.
What about using gold (of any type) to settle a gambling debt or court claim?  No again.  Not legal.
Okay, let's say you just want to use gold jewelry as money with other regular people.  Go to a car dealership, say that you want them to give you a volvo, and in exchange you're gonna give them some nice gold bracelets.  Watch them laugh in your face.
"Money" is defined by economists as something that meets 3 criteria: 1. It's fungible.  Gold bullion is fungible, gold jewelry is not.  2. It's a unit of account.  Have you ever heard someone say that a gaming PC costs 8 gold bracelets?  Or that a loaf of bread costs 1/1000 of an ounce of gold?  No you haven't, because gold is never used as a unit of account. 3.  It's a store of value.  Here gold meets the qualification.
What you meant to say is "gold is a store of value."  Agreed.  But it's not money as any economist will tell you.  But don't rely on economists.  Take your "money" to an auto dealership and see if they'll accept your "money."
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:07:03
Agreed, but you don't actually care about inflation, you care about real interest rates.  If inflation is 4% but you can earn 5% on your cash, then inflation isn't hurting you.  And real interest rates are closely tied to GDP growth coupled with central bank money printing.

It's effectively free compared to BTC.  The price of FDIC insurance comes out of the interest you would be paid on a checking/savings account, but those payments can't fall below zero.  How much does BTC pay you to hold it?  Zero.  So FDIC insurance is still cheaper than holding BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:00:13
If bitcoin fell to $50 it would then soon be at zero.  To understand why, you need to understand the bitcoin infrastructure.  At $50, most miners would shut down, so any of the existing miners that were willing to operate at a small variable cost loss would control the network.  It would case to be decentralized.  Additionally, merchant integration would case, because at $50 the market cap of bitcoin is so low, and the volatility so high that it ceases to be an attractive currency.  
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:14:14
You're wayyyyy off base.  First, bitcoin can adapt to certain things but others, because of how adaptation happens.  A hard fork requires miner approval.  Miners will never approve something that hurts their profits.  So an adaptation that would help the network but hurt miners can't happen.  This may eventually destroy bitcoin.  For example, bitcoin can never move from proof of work to proof of stake.
Bitcoin is perfect money?  Lolz.  Currently confirmation times can take 20+ minutes.  Perfect money would have this in seconds.  An altcoin could be created with a block time of 10 seconds, but that's probably too big of a change for bitcoin to achieve.

The mining equipment is already out there.  You have all these miners with massive sunk costs.  They turn their equipment off when the variable cost becomes higher than the variable gain.  That is, when the cost of electricity becomes higher than the revenue expected from mining and selling BTC. So the scenario is - let's say I have a warehouse in China full of SHA256.  It's all turned off because I'd be losing money by running it with BTC below $300.  BTC keeps falling all the way to $50 and 95% of current hashing power falls away.  Then I decide, for a goof, to turn my equipment back on for just 2 hours.  I mine 20 blocks in a row in an hour (because the difficulty has fallen so much), all for the price of probably just a grand in electricity.  Maybe I use those 20 blocks to double spend, or maybe someone from the Chinese government, or NSA, or Mastercard rented my equipment for an hour to put the nail in the coffin of BTC.

Basically, you keep jerking off to the idea that gold is important, but every single one of your arguments as to why it's important actually works against you, and suggests that US treasury bonds or other foreign currency reserves are FAR more important.
Once again, the countries that have been buying gold have been buying FAR more foreign currency reserves like the EUR, USD, CHF etc...

You contradict yourself (or common sense) a bunch.  
First, citizens always had alternatives to fiat, namely gold and similar commodities.  Governments responded by making it illegal or confiscating it when it threatened their power.  The government could do the same with bitcoin.  How hard do you think it would be for any government to simply put you in jail until you handed over your private keys?  The UK already did this to a couple people.  
Second, how hard would it be for the government to take over the bitcoin mining network?  The answer - trivially easy.  They could easily buy a couple hundred billion worth of GUIs themselves, but more realistically, they'd simply take over existing infrastructure.  It's impossible to hide the big server farms, and the NSA can just show up and confiscate them and run them themselves, or bribe/threaten the biggest operators to do their bidding.
Third, you give examples of governments creating hyperinflation...yet here we are with the whole world still using fiat.  The issue of hyperinflation has empirically been irrelevant to the power of fiat for 2000+ years, even with alternatives like gold, silver, platinum, big stone wheels, chocolate, and all the other things that have been used as currency through time.
You think bitcoin is "resilient."  It's not.  At any time, any of the biggest governments around the world could easily control the network, and that will always be true as long as the mining server farms reside within the borders of countries that are hostile to bitcoin (or allies to countries that are hostile to bitcoin).  Actually, strike that.  Even if you moved the server farms to the center of the ocean or north korea, if the US actually cared, they could still wipe it out or take it over with trivial effort.
Bitcoin will only exist as long as the biggest governments allow it to.  Period.

The concern is that if the price falls far enough, it will destroy bitcoin.  Bitcoin cannot be a useful medium of exchange if the market cap is too small.

It's a solution in search of a problem.  Visa seems to work just fine as a centralized system.  
I'll go a step further.  Bitcoin is *more* fragile and centralized than Visa.  For most of 2014, bitcoin mining was controlled by 2 pool operators.  Those operators were unregulated and could not reasonably be held accountable in court.  Bitcoin was subject to the whims of 2 operators.  Visa on the other hand is not free to act capriciously; they are subject to a massive set of regulations and laws.  Users of the visa system are not trusting Visa, they're trusting the legal system of their country, a far more decentralized system in the sense that there are multiple layers of courts they can appeal to.

Assuming the hardfork happened, it would also make all of the other major miner's hardware useless.  Why would other miners render their own SHA256 ASICS useless?  To protect the network?  Maybe, but you get into a prisoner's dilemma issue.  No individual miner with SHA256 ASICS is going to render his own hardware worthless, even if most of it is currently turned off.  
We've already seen this demonstrated time and time again.  The Bitcoin network has been controlled by 2 mining pools despite consistent complaints that this centralization undermines the very purpose of bitcoin.  Individual miners don't care - they still stay in those two pools.

Or here's another.  You transfer your BTC to an exchange, but the exchange gets hacked and never pays back your BTC.  Your "wealth" was converted into nothing.  Not really wealth.
The best analogy here is maybe a giant pile of cash under your mattress in a really bad neighborhood.  If you get robbed every time you set foot out of your door, you can't spend or deposit your cash.  You might as well not have it.

Agreed.  My point was just that from its creation through 2011, bitcoin was basically exclusively the interest of serious programmers and people who wanted to use the silk road, so the fact that adoption wasn't increasing dramatically didn't mean much.  Today, many of its "features" are at least partially expressed, yet adoption still isn't picking up.  That's worrying.

I've never been to Thailand, so maybe that's an exception.  I'm pretty sure you'd have a tough time buying a car with gold in China, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, Germany, Finland, the UK, or Australia, to name a smattering of countries from every continent.
The fact that you could sell your gold for money at a pawnshop has no bearing on whether it's money.  I can sell barrels of crude oil at hundreds of locations around the USA for standardized prices, but no one would call that money.  Heck, there's a liquid ebay market for used Allen Edmonds leather shoes.  In the past 2 years I've bought 3 pairs and sold 2 pairs; they're almost fungible.  But obviously not money.  
I agree that money is "what the people accept" as you say.  The point is that 99% of stores in the world will not accept gold as payment.  And if you ask the average American or Chinese person or German or South African how much wealth they have in terms of gold, or the value of their home in terms of gold, they'll have no idea.  They do not use gold as a unit of account for their wealth or for the cost of goods.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:45:42
Correct.  My point was you were asking for another news source to report on it but you had the actual source material.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:33:58
China and Japan HATE gold and their actions suggest they think it's nearly worthless.  Statistics in my second paragraph.
If you actually know money, then you know these statistics:
What % of global commerce is completed in gold?  Less than 0.1%.  What percentage of global wealth is gold?  About 3% (about $9 trillion market cap divided by 265 trillion in global wealth).  
You say "tons of gold" like that matters.  A ton of gold is nothing, its only $65 million.  China has bought about 1065 tons of gold, worth about $70 billion. China has bought MUCH more currency and debt than gold.  They hold about $4 trillion in foreign currency reserves.  It looks like China HATES gold and thinks it's nearly worthless.  Only 2% of China's currency-type assets are in gold.  Clearly they don't think it's a great place to store their money.
So let's recap.  Your entire arguments for why gold is anything other than trivial are 1. Some central banks are buying, and 2. There are some quotes by central bankers saying that gold is important.  But  works against you, since central bankers are basically saying that gold is so useless, they don't want it to make up more than 2% of their holdings.  And as for  I could find you 10x as many quotes by central bankers saying gold is worthless.

Because so far there's never been any crypto put forward that was massively superior.  There have only been serious attempts to dramatically improve on bitcoin for about 18 months...Myspace ruled longer.
The mostly like thing to replace bitcoin imo will be a proof of stake crypto.   Miners will never let bitcoin switch over because they have too much of a vested economic interest in proof of work.  And no, I'm not saying that just any garbage proof of stake altcoin has a shot.  It would have to be superior in other ways too, and get some big names behind it early.

That's literally an oxymoron.  A bank can't own **your** house.  Either the bank owns it, (in which case you're a renter) or you own it.  Having a mortgage means you own your house, and you owe the bank money, two separate things.  The house is collateral for the loan.  It's similar to if I borrow from a bank and use my jewelry collection as collateral.  It's still my jewelry until I default on my debt, and then it becomes the banks.  Straightforward law.

For it to be "wealth", you have to be able to spend it at some point, otherwise it has zero value.  Things are worth what they can be exchanged for.  If you can never convert your wealth to food, clothing, a car, etc, it's not wealth.  Right now, converting BTC to something else is extremely hard (if possible at all) to do securely.
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:44:03
What part of this do you not get?
Holding bitcoin = **meaningless**, unless you can convert your holdings into something else.  And that depends on the **probability** that you can successfully convert your holdings?
Honestly, explain to me which part of that simple tautology you're not grasping?
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:03:25
The point is that inflation is relevant because it decreases the real value of your wealth.  BTC is only better than the USD in regard to inflation if an equivalent amount of BTC outperforms the USD over the time period you care about.  BTC has outperformed over the last 2 years, and underperformed over the past one.  At least for the next 10 years it's likely that BTC's relative performance to the USD will depend on other factors (like regulation and adoption) farrrrrrr more than on the USD's inflation characteristics.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:12:40
Sure, but it won't necessarily be BTC that plays that role.  It could be a different altcoin.  The idea of the decentralized trustless network falls apart when a single miner can easily take control of the network, a place we'll likely be at if the price falls much further.

In many cases the CC company can get their money back.  That's the beauty of fiat, transactions are reversible.  So the merchant or hacker bills the credit card company, but the CC company simply never transfers the money.  Or if they did transfer the money, they contact the receiving bank to reverse the transaction.

Why do you keep trying to reduce this to a binary?  You're just arguing against a strawman.  
The "point" you've proven is trivial.  I never disagreed with it.  I never argued that bitcoin could never ever be used for transaction.  **You keep repeating yourself, making a point that no one cares about and that is obvious**  
My point, which you have still failed to answer, is that to determine your wealth you need to multiply the value of your holdings by the probability that you can actually liquidate them.  For BTC that probability is relatively low currently, as has been proven by the widespread thefts.

You're missing the key point.  What keeps the BTC mining network decentralized?  What prevents one person from simply installing enough GUIs to be 80% of the network?  Only cost.  Today that would take more than a billion dollars in hardware.  If 70% of miners turn off their machines, all it would take is for one of the bigger miners to turn theirs back on and incur a million bucks in electricity losses.
Also, remember that the mining network is not decentralized.  We love saying it is, but it's really not.  For most of the last year, the biggest 2 mining pools together had a large majority of hashing power.  For a brief period, just 1 mining pool had the majority.

The fundamental value of any asset is the indefinite string of future cash flows discounted back to the present.  For a stock, investors generally replace "cash flows" with "earnings", because we don't care in general whether we get the earnings in the form of dividends (current cash flows), or if that money is re-invested as acquisitions or stock buybacks (delayed cash flows).  The P/E ratio is purely a reflection of future expected earnings discounted at a particular discount rate.  A high PE ratio means either you expect future earnings to be higher, or you're applying a very low discount rate.
Bitcoin has zero earnings.  If you take finance 101 or econ 101 and you plug bitcoin into any sort of fair value calculator, you'll get an answer of...zero.  Because bitcoin will never produce a cash flow, ever.  
That means that the only hope I have of profiting (or even not losing my initial investment) with BTC is for me to eventually find someone else willing to take it off my hands at the same or higher price.  
This is not the case with Visa.  I can buy Visa and hold it forever, and as long as the company doesn't go bankrupt, I will receive an increasing stream of dividends from them forever.  I never need to sell.  I will receive an unlimited stream of cash from them forever.

1. Bin Laden's team included people with master's in engineering degrees. North Korea has scientists who can make nuclear weapons.  A Japanese terrorist sect has biologists who have genetically engineered viruses to be more deadly.  Is disrupting the DNS hierarchy more difficult than viral genetic engineering and making nukes?  I doubt it.
2.  We frequently see the exceptions.  Bin Laden spent tens of millions of dollars building a terror network.  The Sauds spent hundreds of millions of dollars on extremist education networks to pacify the fundamentalist Muslims in the country.  Surely some terrorist group somewhere, or some anarchist would be happy to spend a couple hundred grand to wreak havoc against the western world.
3.  Imagine you had 300k and were suicidal and anarchist.  Could you assassinate a head of state with it?  How?  Most of the "killers for hire" you'd find on the darknet are just undercover FBI.  Could you "raise an army"?  How?  Those things are really hard and require specialized skills and contacts.  Alternatively, there are lots of genius 22 year old hackers willing to risk 10 years in prison to do DDOS attacks on banks.  Surely one of them somewhere would love to be able to take credit for taking down the DNS system.
As for BTC, we know a lot of people have huge financial incentives to destroy BTC.  The banks and credit card companies HAVE ALREADY spent more than a couple hundred grand lobbying against bitcoin.  Why wouldn't they spend that same money to directly destroy it, if it was legal (which it is).

While tampered hardware is a possibility (as has happened with many USB manufactured in China for brand name companies), that's not what I was thinking about.
I was referring to the fact that when you eventually want to spend your BTC, you must transfer them in some way.  You may think you're transferring your BTC to a legitimate merchant or exchange, but the public key you (or your Trezor) receives, may be a hacker's address.  Take an extreme example - your PC has a virus that converts the appearance public keys on any website to the hacker's public key, and does the same for any sort of digital signature.

Your ratio of semantics to logic to gloating is about 5:1:3, a poor ratio especially considering you're not even tackling my argument.  
Of course the statistics are relevant since we're debating a non-binary issue.  Only an idiot would claim that bitcoin is either entirely secure or entirely insecure.  It is neither of course.  "secure" is not a binary concept as it applies to a currency.  The question is **how** secure.
**remote fiat transfers are relatively secure, because they are insured by the credit card company and by the US federal government.  BTC is not, and so is frequently and irreversibly stolen.**

You couldn't actually spend that 6% though because of inflation.

Wrong.  Land has great cash flows and earnings.  Agricultural land produces crops you can sell every year.  Residential and commercial land lets you rent out property and get cash every year.  Fallow land has value for the probability that it will in the future become agricultural or commercial/residential land.  
Gold is kind of a special case.  First off, it's a consumable.  The single biggest demand for gold every year is the jewelry market.  Many of the people who purchase jewelry never intend to resell it, but think of it similarly to a fashionable scarf or getting the walls of their home painted.  Second, yes some of the value of gold currently (probably about half of the $1260 value) is indeed its role as an alternative store of value.  In this gold is almost unique.  Not many other assets in existence that have value purely for being a store of value.  
Many people (myself included) have bought BTC with the hope that it becomes like gold - a sustainable store of value.  But we have to understand that there is nothing fundamental there.  It's purely a bet on psychology.  We're literally betting that other people will pay more for it down the road, for no particular reason other than that they too hope still others will pay them for it.  And as I said, that's almost never been true of anything in the history of the world.  Gold is a rare exception.

The first part of your statement is true, the second is not.  I make all my purchases via credit card.  When fraud happens (about twice a year), I don't lose anything at all.  I don't get my money back, I simply never actually lose it in the first place.  The stolen money was stolen from my credit card company, not from me.  
Here's how it works: I buy something for $200 over the internet, but get charged $2000.  So far my wealth is unaffected, because the amount of money in my bank account is unaffected, because I haven't made any credit card payment yet.  Until I make a payment I haven't lost anything. I contact my credit card company to report the fraud.  In the off chance that they choose to side with the fraudster, I STILL don't lose anything, because I simply refuse to pay my credit card bill.  They would then have to sue me to recover damages.  I don't know a single person that has actually suffered from this.  Alternatively, 15% of all BTC in existence have been stolen, and most people I know that have used BTC for more than 2 years have either had BTC stolen or lost.

One issue is speed - if the price plummets, sales can't happen instantly.

How do you think that would work?

Two separate issues here.  First let's talk about switching.  Who has/uses bitcoins?  There are a tiny number of people (&lt;1000) who have large amounts of BTC.  Obviously these people would be very upset at having their BTC become nearly worthless.  But wanting your assets to stay valuable doesn't make it happen.  Whether these people switch or not is irrelevant.  Then you have the small number of people who actually use BTC regularly and the merchants who accept them.  Both of these groups (customers and merchants) don't much care what crypto they're using.  The customer just buys the crypto on an exchange or with coinbase and then spends it at a merchant, and the merchant generally instantly converts it back to fiat.  Doing the same with a different altcoin would make no difference.  Personally if Silk Road started only taking Litecoin, I'd switch to litecoin instantly.  Then you have the miners - they'll mine whatever is profitable.  Many miners already mine a bunch of altcoins.
As for fixing bitcoin vs switching - the problem is that miners control the network so miners won't allow changes that hurt them.  For example, bitcoin will never go from proof of work to proof of stakes because that would devalue the massive investment in hardware that miners have made.  
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:54:11

Not really.  Let's say I have my wealth in various bank checking accounts.  These are FDIC insured by the US government.  Then I want to buy a computer, so I link a credit card to my checking account and pay by credit card.  I am protected against credit card fraud by both the credit card company and my bank - if there's a fraudulent charge, I simply don't pay it.  It's exceptionally difficult for me to lose money this way.  
Now let's look at BTC.  At least 15% of all BTC in existence have been stolen.  The equivalent for USD would be if $8 trillion had been stolen in the past 4 years.  
The key difference is that with fiat transactions by credit card, scams happen often, but the transactions are reversible.

You think you know history, but keep making statements that are completely wrong.  
First, many fiat currencies have lasted over a century.  Some examples include the USD, GBP, and CHF.  Second, gold has sometimes lost more than 60% of its value in real-terms (meaning what you can buy with it.)  Third, not only is gold not the base of the global monetary system, it's completely irrelevant to it.

No disagreement with any of that.  The concern though is that bitcoin hasn't necessarily achieved a sufficient moat to have confidence that it will be the specific product to make use of blockchain technology.  It'd be pretty easy for coinbase/bitinstant/miners to all switch to some altcoin quickly.  Maybe fine for humanity, but bad for those of us who own BTC.

Your sarcasm is embarrassingly stupid.  If one bitcoin company can use multisig to deal with customer withdrawals, it is reasonable to assume that another bitcoin company could feasibly implement multisig to deal with customer withdrawals.  Of course it may not be compatible with their current software, but the author's point is so what?  The viability of the company and the safety of customer funds isn't important enough to make your code secure?

Sure.  Let's take a super extreme example to start.  Let's say each BTC had a value of $0.0001, so the total market cap was just $1,350.  That would mean that transferring even 100% of the BTC in existence couldn't pay for a gaming computer.
Now let's go to a more plausible scenario.  Let's say BTC fell to $10.  That would make the total market cap about $135 million, but most of those coins aren't available moment to moment.  They're in cold storage and owned by long-term holders.  So let's say I wanted to buy a car with BTC for $20,000.  I'd need to buy 2000 BTC to transfer that much value, but that purchase would create substantial slippage costs since only a tiny fraction of the BTC market cap is offered near market prices on exchanges at any given time.  
For BTC to seriously useful for major commerce, you'd need to be able to quickly and efficiently purchase at least tens of millions of dollars worth of BTC.  The lower BTC's price, the harder that is to do, because the more coins it requires.

No, lots of scams are reversed not just for the consumer but for the credit card company or bank too, such that the scam never succeeds.
Example:  Scammer gets my bank routing and account number and initiates an ACH transfer from my bank to his.  2 weeks later I realize it and tell my bank.  My bank tells his bank to reverse the transfer and they do.  No one loses any money - scam failed.  With BTC this would obviously be impossible because transactions are irreversible.
The point is that while man in the middle attacks (and even simpler hacks) are always possible with online transactions, when using fiat many of those scams can be reversed such that no one loses anything (except a little time).

Plenty of truth in here, but I disagree with the conclusion.  First, there is an area like with food purchasing and medicine where consumers can't be expected to do their own research.  It's hard enough for full time bank sector specialists to figure out bank assets and liabilities.  No way an average consumer would have any hope of separating the good banks from the bad for their deposits.  Pre-FDIC lots of people simply kept their cash under their mattress.
  As for the costs of FDIC - bank bailouts (for depositors) has been a trivial amount of capital over the last 80 years and hasn't required money printing.  The bank debtholder bailout of 2008 was a different story, although even that didn't really require money printing.  Most of our money printing comes from the basic federal deficit, a fiscal, not banking issue.

Lol at "study of gold."  The gold bug community is full of idiots.  The best "study" of gold ever written was a one pager by Warren Buffett in the 70s where he noted that gold has never profited from inflation, at best it's a mediocre hedge.  Rather, gold is most correlated with real interest rates.  Basically, when other investments provide attractive returns, people don't want to waste their money in inert gold, they'd rather earn a return.  But...when real interest rates are around zero, gold suddenly looks attractive and the price rises.  
Also, anyone who actually studies gold or money will tell you that gold is not money.  The definition of money includes "unit of account."  When was the last time you saw a car or a computer priced in ounces of gold?  Can I pay for my dry cleaning with gold?  
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:25:02
Two things.  First, your transactions were not actually secure.  They were all susceptible to man in the middle attacks.  Second, of course you can use BTC (relatively) securely if you're a computer programmer or a tech geek who invested 20+ hours into understanding how to use paper wallets and electrum securely etc (like I am).  95% of the world can't and won't ever be able to do that however.

I assumed we were distinguishing cryptographic strength from simply taking over the network.  There are literally dozens of governments and thousands of individuals who could take over the BTC network whenever they felt like it.  2 mining pool operators currently control the BTC network.

This is the economic concept of "sunk cost."  Rational economic actors only consider the marginal benefit and marginal cost of an action.  For miners, when the price of a BTC drops, at some point the marginal cost of electricity is greater than the marginal benefit of mining a block.  The hardware expenditures are sunk cost and irrelevant.  
You argue that miners will act stupidly and mine at a loss just to accumulate coins that will hopefully pay go up eventually, but even if they are as stupid as you think, they wouldn't do this.  They would just take that same money they'd be spending on electricity and buy BTC on the open market.

The technology could be hugely important and successful as a back-end, but then it's very unlikely to be bitcoin.  It could more easily be some customized blockchain solution for a particular purpose.  Banks are already talking about creating their own internal blockchains for various purposes.  They'd make use of some of the technological components of BTC without BTC itself.  At $1/coin, even the current "exaggerated" claim of decentralization would collapse, as anyone willing to spend a few million in extra electricity costs could take over the BTC network.

No, that's a common fallacy about many things.  First, the odds of bitcoin replacing fiat completely is zero.  To understand why, you just need to look at the history of governments.  States will always fight to retain the ability to print money, and as long as the have control over police to enforce the payment of taxes via fiat, we'll all need to use some fiat.
Second, the most likely outcome, if bitcoin survives, is that it simply joins the long list of many usable currencies.  The same way that gold, electronic money, paper cash, and metal cash all co-exist, BTC will just be added to that long list.

Network effect is certainly key here, but I think actually less of an issue than with facebook replacing myspace.  To beat out myspace, it wasn't just a new technology.  No matter how good a new social media site is, almost no one is gonna join if no one they know is on it.  For social media sites, the network is close to 100% of what they offer.  
Now let's think about bitcoin.  Let's say someone released a new altcoin that most people felt was hugely superior to bitcoin.  How hard would it be to switch?  Let's assume that the existing mining hardware and infrastructure could be used (or would be unnecessary).  Bitpay, Coinbase, Bitinstant, and all the exchanges to simply offer the new altcoin alongside Bitcoin almost immediately.  95% of the bitcoin infastructure could simply be switched over to the new coin almost overnight.

BTC could eventually become viewed as similar to gold, used mostly as a store of wealth.

No, it's factually wrong.  You wrote, "Hoarding gold does not infringe on anyone because it is mostly useless. This is why gold is chosen by the market over more industrial commodities like silver and platinum to be the primary monetary commodity."  You're suggesting that gold became a store of value because it has relatively less value for industrial purposes.
That is simply incorrect.  Gold developed as a store of value long before platinum was used as an industrial metal.  But more importantly, your statements suggests a basic misunderstanding of how markets work.  Markets are collections of self-interested individuals.  The fact that selecting platinum as a store of value may have hurt the auto industry that uses platinum for catalytic converters would have no impact on the decisions made by John and Frank and Joe who are the ones determining  what will be a store of value for an entirely separate set of reasons.

The question isn't "usability".  While cars devalue, the rest of the stuff is not consummable.  The idea is if you're going to store your wealth, you might as well store it in a form that's productive.  Like, if you own a billion dollars in real estate, obviously you can't live in all those buildings, but you can have a management company rent them out and send you a check every year.  Same with owning agricultural land - every year it grows crops that get sold and you get a check that you can use to buy BTC or more land or whatever.  On the other hand, if you own 100 BTC at the start of the year, you still own exactly 100 at the end.

Well, if it's lessercoin, of course not.  If it's supercoin, than sure.  Remember, bitcoin currently has almost zero users.  "almost zero" relative to what it needs to have to succeed.  In the grand scheme of things, a successful crypto needs to be at say 100.  Most altcoins are at 0.0001, litecoin is at 0.1, and bitcoin is at 3.  Bitcoin is far, far ahead of anything else, but still has very few users.  
Let's say someone created a new crypto that almost everyone agreed was technologically superior for various reasons, and it had a "killer app", like a really intuitive and well functioning and secure wallet app for android and apple.  And then some VCs got behind it and spent $100 million on marketing it.  Within months you could easily have a couple million regular users of the new crypto, which is more than bitcoin has.

Wrong.  The Chinese government has 1065 tons of gold, which is a completely negligible, trivial amount (just 2% of their currency reserves.)  Not gonna keep repeating myself.
You just keep stating that gold is important over and over with no argument behind that.  You also seemingly don't understand how state's work.  A state is a "legitimate" monopoly on force over a particular region.  The GDP of that region and all the wealth it contains is under the control of the state.  The world's wealth therefore backs the world's fiat.  Let me restate that again.  Want to know what backs USD?  The wealth of the US, which is controlled by the US government.  Want to know what backs the ruble?  The wealth of Russia, which has been collapsing, and therefore so has faith in the ruble.
Fiat value therefore comes from two things: 1. the wealth of the country controlled by the government that prints it, and 2. the control of that government (i.e. its power to reliably tax the wealth in its territories).
The gold position of countries is completely irrelevant.  That's why countries and central banks worldwide have chosen to buy fiat and bonds and only the tiniest amount of gold.  It's also why the average American, and person worldwide has only a tiny percentage of their personal wealth in gold.  Governments don't care about gold.  Citizens don't care about gold.  It's just a pretty metal.  Get over it.

Eh, you can't really take an asset's price move as evidence of anything.  That's kind of circular reasoning.  It's like saying, "hey, this petfood company in 1999 is worth $20 billion dollars, so clearly it must be valuable."  Actually it was just people being idiots and bidding up a worthless company to $20B.  Doesn't mean the same thing is happening with bitcoin, but...we did just see the price fall 86%.  Did BTC become 86% less valuable over the last year?  No, so maybe the previous price was a bubble.  okay, but if it was a bubble at $1200 and $800, maybe also at $400, and $200, and $20?  There's no right answer.
The reason I own BTC is a psychological bet - I think there's a 50% chance it does becomes a "store of value" and if a dozen super rich guys want to put 3% of their wealth into it, that would require a market cap of $15b at least.

The issue is that the bitcoins won't get to the person you're trying to trade them with.  If you want to convert bitcoins to a car, for example, you have to give the car owner the bitcoins.  Let's say you try to send him the BTC, but the public key address is wrong because you fell prey to a man in the middle attack.  You lose your BTC but never get the car because the car owner never got paid.  How much were your BTC worth in that scenario?  Exactly zero.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:25:32
You're skipping one step in the logical argument.  My argument is that: 
1. Value is defined as what the asset can be exchanged for.  (wealth is just an aggregation of value).
2. If BTC can't be transferred securely, then your wealth is questionable.  The extent of your wealth depends on your ability to exchange BTC for other goods, which depends on the probability of theft.
3. Fiat can be easily transferred securely (e.g. via wire transfer between checking accounts), whereas BTC cannot currently be transferred securely.  
4.  Therefore, to consider BTC a store of wealth requires either an assumption that in the future it will be able to be securely transferred for other goods (which also assumes it will not decline to worthlessness), or a probabilistic assessment of your odds of successfully completing a transaction with the current insecure methods.

   I'm far from a technical expert but I can wager some guesses.  The current proof of work system undermines many of bitcoins primary claims.  For example, BTC IS NOT decentralized today.  2 pools control the majority of the mining power, and occasionally it's been a single pool.  That could probably be fixed with a tweak to bitcoin core, but it hasn't happened yet because those 2 pools won't let it happen.  The "downhill momentum" you reference is maybe one or two billion dollars in specialized hardware; a truly trivial investment for what you hope will be a global currency.  Compare that, for example, to Google's $10 billion that it spends EACH YEAR on its hardware.  
  Another issue with BTC is the long confirmation time (~15 minutes) has created a lot of problems.  Many merchants won't consider payment complete until there have been multiple confirmations, so a transaction often takes 45 minutes+, far longer than using apple pay, venmo, or a credit card.  Block times could be as short as 30 seconds using other proof methods.  These is more likely to be fixed using sidechains or something, but again, as a non-technical expert I wonder why it hasn't been fixed yet.  Maybe there's another conflict of interest with miners.
  And lastly, as with any high technology product, I can't even begin to imagine the future discoveries.  There are minds out there as creative as Satoshis who may show us blockchain 2.0 that blows us away and makes BTC look like the abacus.

You're just replacing a centralized exchange with a centralized escrow agents.  Even if every trader uses a different escrow agent, for that trader, the counterparty risk is still centralized.  I don't see the benefit.  I'd much rather trust a traditional bank or company than a BTC escrow agent.

All prices on all markets are manipulated in both directions.  The manipulation is really trivial though.  It's easy to manipulate BTC higher or lower for a few minutes or hours.  Impossible over months.  Manipulation doesn't cause a 70% price decline over 6 months.  That doesn't even make sense.  If the "fair" price was higher, buyers would simply bid it back up.

I used the same tense as the original post.  If bitcoin "has already died" then it "has already exploded." ...  
Obviously the people who said it had died weren't saying that it was worth zero with zero transactions and zero hashing power.  They were saying it was on a downward trend in that direction.  Similarly, the people saying Bitcoin will shoot higher weren't saying it already was at $10,000, but that it was on trend to do so in the relatively near future.

In general I agree, and CC losses are at last in the billions each year (I saw an estimate of $3 billion per year in the US).  But, in many cases the CC company can get their money back. That's the beauty of fiat, transactions are reversible. So the merchant or hacker bills the credit card company, but the CC company simply never transfers the money. Or if they did transfer the money, they contact the receiving bank to reverse the transaction.

I don't think you've thought this through.  Visa is "centralized", yet processes 300 million transactions a day.  The federal reserve is centralized, yet supports the most successful financial system the world has ever seen.
Ask yourself, why is decentralization important?  What does it add?  The quick answer is anti-fragility and "trust."  The idea is that in a decentralized system, one actor can't take control of the system.  However, this is based on a basic misunderstanding.  Visa is subject to massive regulations and laws.  If they tried to rob their customers, we'd have easy recourse through our country's legal system.  The only trust we really have to have is in the broad and decentralized legal system.  In contrast, "decentralized" bitcoin is really easily exploitable.  Basically, anyone with a couple billion dollars can take control of the network.  Much more easily however, the biggest pool operators could simply collude together, or be bribed/coerced by someone like the NSA to undermine the system.
Now let's consider the alternative, a blockchain with no bitcoin.  Imagine if Visa simply replaced their current transaction network with a blockchain.  The same people would have Visa credit cards in their wallet, they wouldn't even be aware of the change.  They'd still be spending US dollars and euros and yen.  But the transactions would be handled internally by visa via a blockchain.  The blockchain would serve the same role for them as their current payment network, it would just be faster and cheaper to operate.  They wouldn't have any need for mining, and their incentive system would be identical to what it is currently, which appears to be working just fine.
@_date: 2015-05-19 11:55:33
As a percentage, far more people have been majorly hurt by using bitcoin than visa.  The percentage of people having their assets unfairly seized or frozen who use visa is a tiny fraction of those who've had bitcoins stolen or lost.

I think you have a very skewed perspective on Gates.  The consensus among computer scientists at the time was that he was a super genius engineer and programmer.  He was the Michael Jordan of programming, and even when Microsoft was a billion dollar company, he was still tightly involved with the software.  Even when Microsoft was a $100 billion dollar company, Gates was spending about 70% of his time on engineering and coding (unheard for a big company).  Of course at that point he wasn't coding himself; he would meet with teams of engineers and criticize their code.  Part of why he was able to grow Microsoft so quickly was that all the top programmers in the world wanted to work with him.  Your perspective on Microsoft and Gates probably comes from the very end of his tenure.  It's easy to forget that a good chunk of modern computing was literally invented by Gates.  If you talk to one of the engineers who worked at Microsoft in its first decade, they'll explain how they genuinely felt they were changing the world.  They were the center of the technology revolution.  
In contrast, Jobs was never viewed as an exceptional engineer by his peers.  He was an exceptional marketer and an excellent leader (although a mediocre manager.)

There's so much stupidity here, it's hard to know where to start.  
First, the reason the percentage is relevant is because it serves to debunk your claim that central banks care about gold.  If China actually cared to accumulate gold, why didn't they spend the $4 trillion they spent on fiat and accumulate 70%+ of the world's gold?  Rhetorical question.  You kept saying China was buying TONS of gold.  I kept explaining why you're retarded, that the amount they're buying is trivial.  Even in relative percentage terms, it's trivial.  Last time - if they actually cared about gold, they'd have used some of the $4 trillion they spent on fiat to buy gold.  But they didn't.  Because you're wrong.
Second, yes fiat is a political construct, just as gold is a psychological construct.  And no, the strongest government in the world can't be replaced overnight.  Can't believe I even need to say that.  Obviously the military and economic strength of a government are relevant to the confidence you should have in its fiat.  Governments can devalue fiat, and they can also confiscate gold.  Owning gold requires faith that the government won't confiscate it, and will protect you from your neighbor stealing it without repercussion.  You know the saying, if you have gold and I have a gun, pretty soon I have both the gold and the gun.

I'm done with you.  Every claim you've made I've debunked easily, and then you just shift your language slightly.  What you're exhibiting is called desperate wishful thinking.  For the last 200 years you could've been a wealthy successful man without ever touching an ounce of gold, and that will still be true for the next 200 years.  Try saying the same about fiat...lolz.

You didn't follow my argument.  You said that back in 2011 the price was lower but the network was functional.  I pointed out that back in 2011, the network had periods where it was neither trusted nor functional, even though few people were trying to attack it.  So what happens if we combine the best hackers with a low price?  Really I'm not concerned with hackers though.  My concern is miners.  At a low price, a single miner will be able to easily take control of the network.  No hacking necessary.  They'll just have to turn their mining equipment on when its uneconomic to do so.  They'll throw away 50k in electricity costs and then do with the network what they will.

With BTC on the other hand, 15% of all BTC in existence (at least) have been stolen in the last 4 years.

Neither of those examples are tied to centralization.  First, regulations apply equally to centralized and decentralized networks.  Yes, enforcement on decentralized is tougher in that there's no single company to regulate, but the government can regulate consumers easily enough in regards to practical transactions.  If the Federal Government required that every single bitcoin transaction had to be reported to a new agency and any who didn't were committing a felony, and they aggressively enforced it...you get the idea.  Also, the federal government can could treat miners or the providers of bitcoin software the way they treat Visa and require that donations to snowden be forbidden, and they could jail miners who include donations to snowden in blocks.  The miners' safety would be dependent on being located in non-extradition treaty countries, but you could say the same about a centralized system located overseas.

Basically, the burden is always on the government to show a compelling reason to limit speech, but the burden is fairly low for things like data, passwords, etc, whereas it's a very high burden for anything that can be taken as true political speech.  So for example, it's illegal to sell stolen credit card numbers, even though you could argue that you're simply being paid to "speak."  The supreme court rolls their eyes at that argument.  In this case, transmitting of a private key to a terrorist (for example), is aiding a terrorist and a felony, and could possibly even be prosecuted for treason.

Yes, I believe so (to your first point), and yes, miners can quickly point their hashing power elsewhere.  But I don't think that means the pool's power is inflated in the very short-term.  Imagine NSA takes over the two biggest pools, and they just start doing weird stuff with them, like creating some weird forks and focusing the pool's power on those.  And then they start releasing tons of contradictory misinformation about which pools have been compromised, with some misinformation claiming it's a glitch or a doublespend or an attack by hackers etc.  Even if all the miners decide to just go independent, they won't know which block to build off of.  It would be really hard to figure out what's going on.  The result would generally be mass confusion which would quickly become a loss of faith in the system.  
The same could theoretically happen with fiat, it'd just be much harder.  Imagine if we started dumping counterfeit Rubles on Russia that were nearly identical, but had slightly different watermarking.  And we simultaneously covered their media with faked news reports reporting contradictory things about how to distinguish real from fake currency, such that the average Russian didn't know who to believe or which bills were fake.  You'd probably see average Russians quickly ditching Rubles for USD, gold, bitcoin etc.
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:25:14
No collusion required and no contradiction.  Any one entity, the NSA, a rich Russian oligarch, a wealthy Chinese general etc could destroy bitcoin whenever they wanted.  All it would take is to coerce/bribe/hack a couple of the major mining pool operators and destroy faith in the system.  While messing with the blockchain you would simultaneously spread misinformation.  You'd co-opt some respected leader in the bitcoin community (again through bribery or coercion) and you'd easily create general confusion.  Miners would have no idea which pool should be joined, large numbers of blocks would have to be rolled back, and any integrity would be gone.
Also your claim which you've repeated in your last paragraph twice now is simply wrong.  For most of 2014, the blockchain was controlled by just 2 mining pool operators who had the majority of hashing power.  Briefly it was controlled by just one.  That one guy could have issued as many bitcoins as he wanted or doublespent.  Of course other miners would then have fought back and there'd have been a battle over rollbacks etc.  Of course other miners can always fork the blockchain etc.  But if your argument that someone doesn't possess the power to do something because others will stop them...why not apply that same logic to a government or to the Federal Reserve?  You could foolishly say, "The US government should not be feared because if they ever try to overstep their power others will quickly stop them."  Maybe, maybe not, but not instantly, and not before doing great damage.  Same with mining pool operators.
And lastly, your second paragraph is very strange.  It seems like you're trying to argue that bitcoin is better, but actually doing the opposite.  "for over 100 years" &lt;--- a long history lends credibility to USD much as it does to gold.  "a mathematical algorithm" &lt;----an algorithm can't necessarily respond to changes in demand/supply intelligently, which is partly why gold failed so badly as a currency; but the opposite problem is also true; the bitcoin algorithm can be changed at any time at the whim of the people who control the hashing power.  I have less faith that they will change things in a positive way than I have faith that the Federal Reserve chairman will control the money supply in a positive way.  "not a single one of them ever possessing the power to confiscate the unit of record or change the rate of issuance"&lt;---- as we established, this is simply false.  Bitcoin's hashing power was more than 50% controlled by a single pool operator briefly last year, and for a long time 40% controlled by a single pool.  Obviously 50% is not a magical line.  At 40%, you will eventually mine 8 blocks in a row, basically giving you control over the blockchain at least temporarily.
So let me answer your question:  Yes.  One issuing authority with a 100 year record of relative price stability and extreme political stability has shown it is more fit to issue a global reserve currency than an algorithm that can be easily abused by anyone with a couple billion dollars or anyone in power at the NSA or KGB.  That's why people want USD not gold.  That's why people want USD not bitcoin
Now...I own bitcoin.  I like bitcoin.  The Federal Reserve recently printed an unprecedented amount of money that I think will lead to continued depreciation; and almost every other central bank worldwide is following their lead.  So I think bitcoin could potentially become a meaningful store of value, like a distant second to gold.  But let's not fool ourselves.

The "theft" is a little trickier.

The logic is in the second clause of the second sentence.  I'm not sure how to simplify it any further, but I'll try once more.  To heat your home you are paying for two things - hardware and electricity.  Let's assume that the efficiency in converting the electricity to heat are identical in all cases so your cost of power is identical.  Considering that current heaters on the market are already competing to be cheapest, it's safe to assume that the ASIC hardware would be the same price to manufacture or more expensive than existing heaters.  So as a consumer, how am I going to save money or profit by using the ASIC?  Only if the bitcoins that I mine (or that the company mines using my ASIC) are substantial enough to defer the cost.  But they aren't...the hashing power will be so trivially low as to be irrelevant.

My point is that their startup investments are unlikely to be proxies for bitcoin buying.  It can be very different bet.  For example, this startup may not look to profit from bitcoin at all whatsoever.  They've said that, among other things, they will be looking to use blockchain technology to support "the internet of things."  It's possible that 21's business model would be profitable even if bitcoin went to zero.  
And yes, the mining can be modeled as a call but you need to apply a bunch of unrelated discounts.  If you invest in a company with a complex mining strategy, you may end up with zero exposure to the price of bitcoin for lots of reasons.  For example, 21 could fail to secure relationships with the relevant hardware manufacturers, they could be beaten by another startup with a similar model, they could get forced out of the market by US regulation that would not effect a miner in China, etc.  All of that could be theoretically modeled by applying a discount to the value of the call, but in practice it'd be tough.

Campaign contributions do end up totaling in the hundreds of thousands to low millions for senators, and the post-politics jobs are certainly an incentive.  But that kind of issue is true for every government throughout all time.  The second point (post-political jobs) is completely impossible to entirely eliminate.  I would actually support banning regulators from joining the companies they regulated for 5 years, but how do you ban a senator from working for a random Fortune 500 company?

Who we kidding?  For most of 2014 bitcoin's hashing power was controlled by 2 pool operators.  I'd rather a single US-domiciled regulated entity than 2 unregulated operators in China or bumblefuck.

In the scenario we're talking about (where the NSA takes control of the pool operators), they'd likely simultaneously spread misinformation.  There'd be general confusion as to what's going on.  Hash producers wouldn't know where to point.  Some would quickly micromanage their hashing, but lots wouldn't make the change immediately because they wouldn't know what to replace their current pool with.

The only part of the equation we need to look at is the profit from the mining.  We can simply assume that all other parts of the equation (electricity usage, heat generated, cost of hardware) are identical to existing heaters.  I think this is a very conservative assumption since no one has stated any reason why the ASIC would be *more* efficient or cost *less* than existing heating infrastructure.  So in the example of porting heat over, we can just treat that the same as porting heat generated by a normal heater.
So, how much revenue could an ASIC heater owned by a consumer generate?  Imagine if the entire existing mining infrastructure shut down, so the new ASIC heaters had zero competition.  And 20 million consumers used them.  650k bitcoins (roughly) will be mined next year.  So that's 0.0325 bitcoins per user per year, or $5.88 per year at current bitcoin prices.  Obviously the real number would be much lower because the consumer ASIC heaters would be competing with professional centralized mining locations.  The point is you have to make a lot of extreme assumptions for an ASIC consumer heater to make sense economically.

Imagine that you start playing Russian Roulette and I tell you it's dangerous.  You pull the trigger and live and again I tell you it's dangerous. Same thing a third time.  And then you stupidly state, "I've heard that same argument over and over for 4 years and I haven't died yet."
Honestly, how do you not understand that hearing the same argument for 4 years doesn't make it any less likely to be correct?  It's only a poor argument if you twist it into a straw man that bitcoin **must** fail.  I never said that.  I simply said that there is a **risk** that these people could choose to destroy it, a risk that has not yet come to pass.  A risk that may never come to pass.  But a substantial risk that may come to pass...tomorrow or next year etc.
 
The second half of your second paragraph is nonsensical.  I've described two methods of attack, neither of which strengthen the network.  The first involves no new hashing power; it's simply coercing/bribing existing mining pool operators to undermine the integrity of the network.  Obviously that would not increase the value of the network and it's comical that you suggest otherwise.  The second is that the NSA spends a year and a couple billion actually building enough hashing power to control the blockchain; this is **much** less likely, but again would of course not strengthen the network if that entire hashing power was being used purely to perform bad actions.
Your last paragraph starts with a flawed comparison; Deepbit had no reason to think they would have plurality hashing power indefinitely, while the NSA could.  Also (obviously) Deepbit wants to function cooperatively with other miners, while the NSA would be totally happy with a series of confusing forks.
And your last second is a basic fallacy.  Again, if I play Russian Roulette and survive a single trigger pull, it doesn't prove that I'll survive the next one.  
I'm done trying to teach you basic probability.  Before responding, ask yourself this question, "is what I'm about to say a basic logical fallacy, in which I'm assuming that because something happened in the past it must happen in the future."

You've made a very strange argument that suggests you don't understand the concept of "risk."  You've basically argued that because you've gone skydiving 10 times and never died, then clearly the risk of dying while skydiving must be zero.  It's very silly.
The NSA or a rich Chinese or Russian oligarch could destroy bitcoin whenever they want.  They haven't chosen to do so yet.  They could choose to do so tomorrow.  The fact that they haven't chosen to do so yesterday tells us very little about the choices they will make tomorrow.  If bitcoin continues growing, the cost and difficulty to destroy it will continue growing.  In 2010 anyone with a few million to waste could probably have destroyed it.  Today that number might be in the low billions.  In 2018, I hope it will be $100 billion.
And your argument about forking is flawed.  What prevents someone with a large amount of hashing power from simply repeating the attack on the new fork and then the newer fork, over and over again.  The point isn't that someone could destroy the bitcoin network computationally, but that they can destroy the integrity of the system.  If bitcoin users have to constantly worry about long strings of blocks being rolled back, it ceases to be a viable transaction method or store of value.

There's two big issues here.  The first is causality.  Industries help elect people who genuinely agree with them.  For example, the Koch brothers fund conservative Christians who are genuinely pro-life and help them get elected.  Not saying this is true for all or even most politicians, but some part of the appearance of "quid pro quo" is simply politicians who are naturally environmentalist taking money from the Sierra Club etc.  
Second, politicians' votes are certainly influenced by campaign contributions, but I think usually on issues that are simply unimportant to them.  For example, let's say I get elected to Congress and I really care about the environment, helping farmers, and increasing education funding.  I don't have much of an opinion on US foreign policy in Africa.  So I take a contribution from some industry that benefits from tariffs imposed on Africa imports and I then vote in their favor.  I don't know of any way to eliminate this kind of "corruption" except to totally ban campaign contributions.
At the end of the day, neither of these points counters the claim that money moves politics.  But that's true in all governments throughout all time.  It's just an obvious statement that even calling it "corruption" or "bribery" seems to simply confuse the issue by rendering those words useless in the discussion.
@_date: 2015-04-17 22:42:58
You failed to heed my advice and again fell prey to the logical fallacy.  Yes, of course bitcoin has forked and had rollbacks and been attacked.  I also know about transaction malleability...  And they were serious events, even though bitcoin had not yet signed on Expedia and Microsoft, and when bitcoin was still just a glimmer of hope as a legitimate tool of commerce for anything other than Silk Road.  It's not a perfect analogy, but compare the problems with a toddler falling over 5 times in a day versus a 70 year old.  With the toddler, it is expected, and not terribly damaging.  It neither permanently damages the toddler, nor is it a sign of anything serious.  With the 70 year old, it may result in a broken hip or leg, and it may be a sign of a problem effecting their balance and equilibrium, far more serious.  The fact that a person fell 5 times a day as a toddler and was fine has very little connection to their falling 68 years later.
And you've ignored the main scenario I've specified:  instead of your straw man where the attacker pursues a single ignored fork, they instead keep working off of the legitimate fork.  Every time they mine a block on the legitimate fork they mess with it (including double spends, fake transactions etc), forcing a new fork.  Then they mine off that new fork, forcing yet another new fork and rollback.

Let's cut your idiotic argument into two parts.  The first part would also be grounds for standing idly by and watching any dictator massacre his own people.  It's an argument for doing nothing when you could've easily prevented the holocaust or East Timor massacres.  
  Your second argument is a common fallacy of confusing outcome for decision.  The vast majority of middle eastern analysts thought that if we took out Saddam, Iraq could transition to democracy and self-rule fairly quickly.  The consensus was wrong, and Iraq has produced more in-fighting than expected, and proven incapable of governing themselves democratically in the short-run.  Maybe the analysts got unlucky the way an expert surgeon can occasionally still kill a patient in surgery.  Or maybe they were incompetent, I don't know.  Either way, that has nothing to do with whether invading Iraq was moral.

Lots of poor logic here.  "insane price rises" are purely relative.  Bitcoin's total market cap never broke $10 billion.  That's trivial.  Uber is valued at over $40 billion.  Facebook at more than $200 billion.  Of course annual returns of 200% are not sustainable; few people said that they were.  But "unsustainable" applies to the 200% returns not the price level.  The nominal price of bitcoin is arbitrary.

Affixing a signature to a political petition is definitely protected speech, regardless of where that petition is hosted.  However, if that petition is for the lynching of a particular black man and it's nailed to his door, affixing of the signature may also constitute felony harassment.  
And while the blockchain does have similarities to a petition, in this regard I think that's more of a superficial comparison.  While bitcoin as an experiment can be thought of as political expression, an individual transaction used to, say, purchase drugs, certainly isn't, anymore than a purchase of drugs on the street is political expression.

So if I said, "bitcoin is a currency."  Or "bitcoin is a commodity and store of value."  You would tell me that no, i"m wrong, bitcoin is actually nothing more than speech?  
Obviously bitcoin is not "speech" as anyone from the 1970s would have ever used the word.  And the whole idea of the 1st amendment was specifically to protect political speech.  They didn't want to explicitly spell out what "political" meant for fear that the powers that be would use the power of defining to control speech they didn't like.  So "speech" is definitely super broad, but that broadness is really meant to keep a wide moat around true political speech.  A bitcoin private key doesn't fit that mold to me.  Yes, it is reflecting an idea, but, if bitcoin is working, it also reflects a transfer of an asset with tangible value.  When you "speak" the private key to me, I can suddenly buy a car that I couldn't afford before.

I don't trust big banks either, nor the Federal Reserve.  But I trust them a hell of a lot more than any given pool operator.  Part of the problem is that bitcoin currently has no moat to centralization.  We saw that last year when one pool operator briefly had more than 50% hashing, and for most of the year 2 pool operators had over 50%.  Things are better at the moment, but there's nothing to prevent a repeat of last year.  There's also nothing to prevent the NSA or Russia, or China, or a random Russian oligarch from simply engaging $3 billion worth of mining equipment and taking control of the network.

A decentralized system is actually easier to attack.  A single miner isn't awake 24 hours a day, and is far less capable of reacting to an attack.  They're far less able to quickly recognize what's going on and to figure out which fork to mine, or to figure out that a rollback is necessary...Imagine an ecosystem where the NSA has 35% of hashing power, and no one else has more than 1%.  How would everyone else coordinate to fight off the NSA without joining pools?

You're confusing cause and effect.  Gold was used as a currency in many economies.  Gold coins were "money" for many cultures, and used for shopping and being paid.

  US police and security agencies routinely use all sorts of legal and gray area means to shut down things they view as problematic.  Civil Asset Forfeiture is a good example - police and the FBI have the legal authority to seize any and all assets suspected of being in any way connected to a suspected crime.  They very often seize the assets of totally innocent people.  They are not required to return those assets even if the person is found innocent.  Individual states are now passing legislation overturning this.
  Here's how it would most likely go down:  NSA top brass believe that bitcoin is being used to facilitate terrorism and drug trafficking.  They decide to shut it down.  They do some digging on mining pool operators that live in China, Russia etc.  If they even have the slightest *hint* of suspicious those people may have committed any felony in their entire lives, they have grounds to confiscate the mining equipment.  They tell the pool operators, either you play ball with us, or we confiscate all your property, and *maybe* you'll get it back in 3 years, but if you play ball, we'll put you on our payroll for 200k a year as an NSA consultant.  The mining pool operators are instructed to do whatever would be most destructive to faith in the system.

Nope...only own bitcoin.  And actually a sizeable amount.  I really hope bitcoin succeeds.  But lying to myself won't help bitcoin...
As for  there's two separate issues.  First, while we all love the decentralized aspect of bitcoin, that doesn't mean that other people couldn't use a centralized blockchain for other purposes.  Most specifically, Visa could simply replace their current payment network with a blockchain version and no one would notice, except that it would probably eliminate 90% of their costs.  They're researching this currently.  And the Federal Reserve has talked about using a block chain for settling payments between banks - again, it would just replace a current centralized system with a faster/cheaper centralized system.
Lastly, bitcoin is centralized.  I wish it wasn't, but it is.  You've got 3 mining pool operators that control the network.  How hard do you think it would be for the NSA to hack/bribe/coerce 2 of the 3 to instantly gain control of the network?  Or, of course, the NSA could just invest in a couple billion dollars worth of GUI to control the network.  Heck, 50% of the hardware used for mining bitcoin is in at most a couple dozen locations.  The NSA (or whoever) could just physically take control of those facilities if they wanted.

The gray area is what "right to bear arms" means.  I'm sure you're familiar with the fact that until fairly recently, it was interpreted in the context of the preceding sentence of, "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state" and was so interpreted that "bear arms" meant belonging to a regulated militia.  
Your interpretation means anyone who wants to have a nuclear weapon must be allowed to buy one.  Obviously not what the Founders intended.  The Founders also didn't intend for "shall not be infringed" to apply to, say, a 4 year old.  I don't think George Washington would have objected to a law that said it should be illegal to give toddlers loaded firearms.

That's kind of a nonsensical statement.  The constitution itself creates the supreme court and defines it's authority to interpret the constitution.  Even if you're a strict constructionist, there is no such thing as an uninterpreted constitution, because it's a brief document.  There's no simple common sense way to apply things like "free speech" or "right to bear arms" to the massive gray areas the Founders never anticipated.
But, even so, the 1st amendment was intended to protect true political speech.  Not to protect a "trick" of transferring wealth via bitcoin private key.

In the first scenario, the NSA (or China or Russia) gains control of a handful of the people who control large amounts of hashing power.  Those people are coerced to do something damaging, like mine blocks and randomly leave out a bunch of transactions or even change the code.  The rest of the bitcoin community does whatever they can to ostracize, rollback, fork, whatever; although this wouldn't be super easy because there'd be a stream of misinformation such that people wouldn't easily know who to trust and which blocks and forks are legitimate, but let's say they succeed quickly.  Then the hashing power just attacks the new "legitimate" chain and again messes with the transactions or the code and more rollbacks/forks etc are needed.  As far as I know, this can continue ad infinitum.  There is no way to prevent someone with tons of hashing power from attacking the network.  Bitcoin relies on the economic incentive - the idea that no one would invest lots of money into mining equipment and then deliberately devalue the bitcoin network.  Obviously this doesn't apply to state actors, who can then bribe or coerce miners and mining pool operators.
The second example of creating hashing power is less likely simply because it's needless.  When the NSA wants to infiltrate a drug ring, they don't grow their own drugs; they simply confiscate some and then use those.  But...if they wanted to, they could.  No, the NSA couldn't create the ASICs overnight, but let's not forget that technologists have routinely underestimated the power of the NSA/CIA/FBI to create insane technological infrastructures quickly.  The NSA was recording every international phone call 15 years ago when most technologists said that it was completely impossible because it would have required an unimaginable amount of hardware for storage and such a project would be impossible to hide.  It turns out the NSA had several huge warehouses full of data storage for the project and had contracts with the largest data storage companies.  Similarly today, it wouldn't be too hard for the NSA to contract secretly with one of the biggest ASIC manufactures in the world and to dominate bitcoin hashing power 6-12 months later.  Again, this is a very unlikely scenario.
If the bitcoin mining community has to constantly rollback blocks, the integrity of the network is obviously broken and merchants will stop accepting it, and individuals will stop trusting it as a store of value.  Why would I want to store my wealth as bitcoins if I know that if I try to sell them, the transaction in which I liquidate the bitcoins may be reversed two hours later?  What merchant would accept bitcoin?  At least with credit card fraud the merchants have both legal avenues of recourse and natural damage control mechanisms - every credit card transaction is connected to an ID, so it takes a ton of effort for thieves to steal large amounts of money via credit card fraud; after a fraud the ID is banned and the thief needs to steal someone else's identity, so there's a natural limiting factor.  No such limiting factor exists for bitcoin unless you start using blacklists or something.

Your second statement is a non-sequitur.  The profit a company can generate offering a bitcoin-related service is not necessarily related to the price or total market cap of bitcoin.  Obviously there's *some* relationship in that we expect more transaction and consumer interest in bitcoin to translate into a higher price, but that wouldn't have to be the case.
As for your first point, that's partially true, but I doubt Horowitz in particular would invest in a company purely as a proxy on bitcoin's price.  He's personally wealthy enough that he could just use his own money to make a huge bet on the bitcoin price itself.

Of course not because the threat has nothing to do with miner incentives.  The fact that you would even mention it suggests you have no idea where the true threat lies.
The problem with the centralization is not that a miner would attack the network, but that it makes the network incredibly sensitive to attacks from non-participants.  For most of 2014, the NSA or Chinese or Russians, or whoever wanted could have destroyed bitcoin by simply bribing/hacking/coercing 2 pool operators.  That's it.  2 operators.  
The market didn't adjust at all whatsoever until 1 mining pool actually had more than 50% of the hashing power, but almost the same risk applies when 3 pool operators have 50% of the hashing power, because it's not all that much harder for the NSA to hack/bribe/coerce 3 people than 1.  
And the idea that the miners who participate in the pool would react quickly and intelligently to such a situation is nonsense.  The NSA would be spreading misinformation and at least one of bitcoin's trusted leaders would be co-opted to help spread misinformation.  There'd be general confusion as to what was going on and to which chain was the legitimate one.  That's all an attacker would want - loss of faith in the system.

A few issues - 
1.  The same way the NSA/China/Russia co-opts the first mining pool they can co-opt the second and the third and the fourth and the fifth.    The CIA has overthrown Latin American countries.  Co-opting half a dozen mining pools is so easy it's a joke.
2.  They'd be spreading misinformation at the same time.  Average miners wouldn't know what's going on, who to trust, or which mining pool to join.

Blockchains don't need bitcoin (or anything similar).  You think they do, but you're wrong.
1. Mining doesn't necessarily add security.  For periods in 2014, a single mining pool controlled more than 50% of hashing power of the bitcoin network and for most of the time 2 mining pools had control.  That's more concentrated than the US banking system.  And those miners are completely unregulated and could take control of the network for their own benefit with no legal repercussions.
2.  You can have a decentralized blockchain where the incentive to miners is something other than bitcoins.  Lots of other ways to do this.  Incentive could be altcoins, or it could simply be fiat.  
3.  A centralized blockchain could be run by something like Visa that would provide many of the benefits of bitcoin (instant, nearly free transactions, the same pseudo-anonymity) etc.

Almost all of your arguments are straw men...I have said over and over what the problems with fiat are and their outcomes...and no it's not an incorrect assumption that I think you're advocating.  You've sang many many odes to gold about how its real money, and it will take it's "rightful" place.  Don't call me "confused" for reading the words you wrote.  You may have forgotten the arguments you made...
And you keep saying gold was money for 5000 years and fiat "doesn't last that long."  Central banking as we now know it is basically 80 years old now, and has been the greatest monetary success story in world history.  You might as well say that humanity crossed continents by ship for thousands of years, so clearly the airplane must be a temporary fad and we will soon abandon it.  Just as medicine has evolved tremendously and no one would argue we will "mean revert" back to using leeches, financial technology has similarly evolved.  We now understand that mercantilism and the idea of gold as wealth led to the destruction of many empires.  Productive capacity is wealth, not some inert metal.  Will governments choose to incorporate a quaint relic like gold or try to relive a 15th century mercantalist disaster to profit from global perception?  Maybe...but I doubt it.

You are still avoiding responding to my basic point: when governments go into excessive debt under gold, the economy collapses by definition, since they have no way to unlever.  When they go into excessive debt under fiat, they can print their way out; it's the reason the US hasn't been in a depression for the last 5 years.  
You seem to think that governments must behave more responsibly under a gold system because they can't print their problems away.  History says otherwise.  Once again, there's a reason that every country in the world abandoned the gold standard.  It's because they behaved irresponsibly under gold systems and had no choice but to abandon it or face ongoing depressions.
Yes, gold introduces accountability.  But history suggests that's a bad thing.

First, real estate is and always has been local.  The 2000-2006 run up and then collapse in 2007 was a bit of an exception in that lots of US real estate rose together and then collapsed together for a whole bunch of reasons.  Immediately after the crisis, we again had easy money policy which has again driven up all real estate prices, although no where near prior valuations.  I don't know anything about Toronto, but in the US, real estate as a whole looks about 20-30% overpriced.  That's not a bubble, and a moderate overvaluation like that could persist indefinitely.  Specific areas look more overvalued though.  For example, home prices in San Francisco have doubled in the last 4 years, although that may simply reflect a new reality that San Francisco is becoming the new New York.  Even if San Francisco turns out to be a bubble though, prices could fall 30% or 50% or let's imagine even 70%.  Whereas it's easy to imagine bitcoin falling 100% if the NSA or Chinese or Russians decide to simply take over the mining network.
As for your comparison to profiting 50% off bitcoin, that ignores the point i was trying to make - it's useful to separate utility from speculative profit.  The LA homeowners might also make a killing if they buy a million dollar home with an 80% mortgage (so they only put down $200k).  Then if LA real estate shot up like San Francisco, the homeowner would earn a 500% profit.  My point was that even if LA real estate does absolutely nothing, the homeowner is still benefiting by living in the home.  in contrast, if you invest your money in bitcoin and it sits steady, you don't benefit.

First, what you call remonetizing, is really just buying.  Yes, as I said, governments could buy a shit ton of gold and force its value up.  They could do the same with beanie babies, and your argument that this would cure the debt problems would be the same.  That kind of "bootstrapping" logic (that I can buy more of an asset I already hold to force its value higher to make me richer) is problematic...not saying it's wrong, but obviously not as simple of a free lunch as you're presenting it as.  
Second, I know how fiat works and how it gets devalued...the weird point is that you're making the exact opposite argument.  Under fiat, excess debt can be printed away.  I understand your argument that the one-time gold "remonetization" would generate wealth for countries to reduce debt.  But have you thought about where that "wealth" comes from?  When the price of gold increases, no real wealth is created.  Global productivity (meaning the amount of stuff produced) is unchanged.  So if governments become wealthier, who becomes poorer?  And why is that massive transfer of wealth to governments a good thing?  And what happens if governments become overlevered when using gold as money?
Why did every country in the world abandon gold if it's so great?  Yes, there' all sorts of politics involved, but the direct answer is that when countries accumulate too much debt under gold, they fall into depression.  So countries abandoned gold to give themselves the flexibility to print their way out of excessive debt.

Ahahahahahahahahahaha.  This is cute.  
Where to start?  First, the burden isn't on the government to prove your income.  If the IRS notices that you have an expensive asset (car, house, vacation, etc), and you haven't paid an equivalent amount in tax, they sue you for tax evasion, and the burden is on you to prove the source of the funds that let you buy the asset.  If you can't prove that you weren't evading taxes, you go to jail.  They can "learn" of your expensive asset a million different ways, not limited to someone who doesn't like you simply anonymously reporting you.
Second, earning an income in a way that won't be in anyway reported is hard and getting harder.  Most legal businesses that pay you (either as an employee or an independent contractor) are either legally required to report the payment, or they'll want to to be able to deduct it as an expense on their own taxes.
3rd: bitcoin is only anonymous until you spend it.  If you want to convert some of your bitcoin wealth into a watch or car or whatever, the person who receives your payment now knows who you are, which means the government likely knows who you are and how many BTC you spent (at least if they bother to investigate).
What you're really betting on is the same thing most Americans rely on who don't report their full income for tax purposes - that the IRS simply won't care enough to target them.  And that's usually a fairly safe bet if your income is small.  But...if someone chooses to report you, or if you just get unlucky, you may end up in jail.

Ah, I see your mistake.  You're confusing economic strength for a strong currency.  While a hyperinflating currency will obviously eventually cause economic strength to deteriorate, a mildly weak currency is usually a boon to a country's economy because it causes the exports to become cheaper (in the currency of other countries), so unemployment falls and productivity rises.

Leverage and debt can build up under a gold system, and then there'd be no out.  If we had been under the gold standard in 2008, we'd probably still be in a great depression since the Fed couldn't have printed it's way out of it.  I don't see gold as a magical cure all.  Countries abandoned gold because its inherently deflationary nature caused all sorts of problems.  Those problems are less severe than Zimbabwe's hyperinflation, but maybe more severe than the periods where fiat was well managed imo.  Guess we'll have to see.

The NSA or a half dozen foreign governments could destroy BTC any time they want super easy.  Hashing power of bitcoin is controlled by 3 pools.  Just hack/bribe/coerce the pool leaders to give you control and you destroy bitcoin.  Or the NSA could just spend a billion or two developing their own hashing power (would probably take 6-12 months), and then undermine confidence in the network.  Or they could just start seizing bitcoin assets as possible evidence of a crime (good luck suing them to get it back), and you'd quickly see support for BTC erode.
When you see sellers of an asset, whether BTC or stocks or real estate, 99.9% of the time the explanation is simply that owners want to sell.  Sometimes it's rich people who just want to liquidate big holdings to buy a yacht or a mansion, sometimes its early adopters who want to diversify, sometimes it's a specific bet on something fundamental, or a speculative trade.

Wrong.  There is something very "sacred" about USD (and the fiat of other countries).  Namely that the government has control over the supply and can increase/decrease it at will.  That's why gold failed and why no country in the world today uses a gold standard.  Before the introduction of the modern central banking system, deflationary depressions were commonplace.  Today they are exceedingly rare.  Now, the US could certainly move to blockchain based digital currency, but it's supply would still be controlled by the government; it would never be bitcoin.
  I'd also note that bitcoin is almost comically fragile.  Anyone with $1 billion could destroy bitcoin any time they wanted.

If you read his annual reports, he's very open about admitting mistakes, and he's abandoned investments many times in the past.  He owns banks because he's confident they'll be good investments over the next 5 years.  He doesn't own bitcoin because he doesn't have confidence in it.  That doesn't mean he thinks it will actually go down, just that he thinks it's a less attractive place to put $500 million than many of the alternatives.  
While he may temporarily "talk his book" if he's looking to sell an asset, there'd be no reason for him to hold an investment indefinitely that he doesn't love.

I actually agree with some of those points.  The yen is a disaster and I've been short for the last 2 years; Japan as a whole has been on the brink of crisis for 5 years.  They *will* have a debt crisis within a few years; their only hope is to induce continued yen depreciation and eventually inflation to inflate away their debt.  I've been short the euro for the last 18 months.  And...I'm trying to short the USD but that's really tough because all real assets (real estate, commodities, etc) look overpriced to me.  That's a big part of my interest in bitcoin, although the idiosyncratic risk in bitcoin makes it a poor USD hedge.
Where I disagree with you is in how you're connecting currency to the economy.  We are currently seeing global competitive currency devaluation, similar to what we saw post WW1.  It's the smart policy move by central bankers, and it's what's kept the world out of a depression in the post-2008 deleveraging.  It's also the biggest reason that all asset prices from real estate to equities are surging.  I'm bearish on most asset prices.
But...none of that suggests that the economy is in trouble.  We could continue to get depreciation or moderately high inflation without any terrible economic effects.  Basically, the fact that sovereigns are in disastrous positions and that US equity is overpriced (by about 30%) doesn't matter all that much.  Sure a drop in equity prices will slow growth for a couple years, likely even induce a recession, but that's normal.  We get at least one recession every decade.  None of that is calamitous.  
My simple point is that currencies can move a whole lot while the economy keeps humming.  Sovereigns can have awful balance sheets while the companies and people of their countries do great.

But "earthquakes" isn't the event we're interested in.  My home (and any particular home in the world you pick) will be unaffected by the vast majority of earthquakes.  E.g. a house in LA is not affected by earthquakes in the Philippines.  So pick a spot that actually has a lot of earthquakes like LA.  Which is more likely - an earthquake occurs that destroys your LA house, or the bitcoin network is attacked in such a way that faith in bitcoin is destroyed.  But even that is a poor comparison - few people own LA real estate purely as an investment.  Most also derive utility from living in their homes.  So imagine you live in your LA house for 10 years and then it's destroyed, you still valued mightily from it (equal to 10 years worth of rent).  I can't live in bitcoins...

"Printing money is a temporary refuge of failing states/currencies, it's not some magic solution."  This is simply not true.  Many of the world's strongest economies have printed money to mitigate recessions and excessive debt levels routinely.  Often it's used to fund wars.  Sometimes it creates major problems (e.g. hyperinflation or total debasement), but much of the time it works out just fine, as it has for the US several times.
The US has devalued the dollar by about 98% over the last century.  Yet not only has the economy obviously grown fantastically over the last century in absolute terms, but we've grown into the largest economy in the world and one of the most dominant in world history...all while the evil Fed destroys our currency.  
You seem to view these things in strangely binary terms.  Printing money has on very rare occasions led to hyperinflation, and in very rare occasions even an "unlimited" amount of printing has failed to avoid deflation (i.e. Japan roughly 1990 to 2012).  But mostly the periodic printing money is how strong economies and strong governments do things.

You're comparing it to a straw man.  First, comparing bitcoin to physical cash is silly.  Insofar as society moves away from physical cash, it will have nothing to do with bitcoin; we could already do away with cash if we wanted to and replace it with things like Venmo and credit cards completely.
Second, bitcoin requires just as many employees (probably more) as its alternatives.  Why do you think bitcoin requires less manpower to maintain then something like paypal?  
Third, bitcoin is vastly inferior in terms of security for consumers.  If my credit card is lost/stolen, I lose only 30 minutes filing a fraud claim and the CC company refunds my money.  If I'm the victim of a man in the middle attack, or if my USB drive or Trezor comes pre-loaded with malware, or if my network gets hacked, my BTC are gone forever with no refund in sight.
There's a reason that consumers have not adopted bitcoin.  Rather than being willfully ignorant of its flaws, we as a community should be focused on improving the bitcoin value proposition for consumers.

You didn't follow my arguments on chess.  Imagine a chessboard one move from checkmate.  There is clearly an optimal move that leads to checkmate.  Now imagine one move further away; still a clear optimal move.  You can back out the entire universe of possible checkmates all the way back to the starting position.  It requires trillions upon trillions of computations, but comp sci actually isn't far off using a combination of pruning algorithms and raw computing power. 
"positional advantage" is just a heuristic for saying that we think a particular position is more likely to result in an eventual checkmate.  But there's no randomness to chess.  A given position either will win with perfect play, draw with perfect play, or lose with perfect play.  Things like control of the center of the chess board or pawn structure are tangents to that fact, only meaningful because we can't calculate perfect play.

I think you're suffering from a mix of availability bias and confirmation bias.  Basically, you know that lots of economies print money and lots of economies implode and you think that one is causing the other.  You're not testing your hypothesis with counterfactuals; i.e. have you compared the list of economies that collapsed with depreciating fiats against the list of economies that collapsed that were on the gold standard etc.  Are you considering that often money printing is a symptom not a disease?  Why do governments print tons of money?  Often because their economy is already collapsing and it's a last ditch effort, or to finance hugely destructive wars etc.  
But let's take a further step back.  What does it mean for a country to be "broke" and when does it matter?  Let's start at the extreme.  Imagine a government with tons of debt and very little tax revenue, but at the helm of a large robust and fast growing economy.  This is no problem.  The government can simply increase taxes a little and reduce its debt.  In other words, debt is only relevant relative to GDP, which is why we usually look at it as a ratio.  So now let's take a step further, what about a country with a high debt to GDP ratio, like the US had post WW2.  Is that a problem?  Not if the economy is growing faster than the cost of servicing the debt.  As we learned from the US, it is frequently possible to "outgrow" a seemingly dangerous debt/GDP level.  Now let's consider the effect of currency debasement.  Does it matter?  The US depreciated its currency 98% over the last 100 years simultaneous with unprecedented and sustained growth.  The reason is that currency debasement is not, in and of itself, a problem.  It can lead to problems if it leads to hyperinflation or loss of confidence in the financial system; both of these depend on real productivity growth and many other factors.  
My key example is the US from 1945 to basically whatever year you want, 1995, 2006, 2014...  Pick an end date where you believe the US economy was fundamentally strong.  Now explain why the world's strongest economy with 50+ years of sustained growth coincided with a severe inflationary period (in the late 70s), massive wasteful war spending, huge currency debasement, and "unsustainable" debt/GDP levels.  
Finally, let's consider the US economy.  We currently have a kind of binary growth situation.  There's massive productivity growth happening in tech.  Things like Uber are producing immediate productivity growth and things like Apple/Google's self-driving cars  (will roll out in 5 years and be prevalent in 10) is similar to the internet in that it's a massively transformative explosion in economic growth with ramifications that we can barely conceive.  On the other end of the spectrum, about 4% of the US workforce became "discouraged" and permanently left since 2008.  That's a big deal, but not the end of the world.  We'll adapt with stronger safety nets and more wealth transfers to the lower class.  Any measure I can find of US productivity shows us either at around 2008 levels (meaning totally stagnant for 6 years) to 25% stronger.  Either way, we still have a $13+ trillion economy.  We have an economy where the average family has 2.2 automobiles, 2+ televisions, and the entire library of congress in their hands via a sexy smartphone.  And... US consumers' balance sheets are at about average levels for the last 50 years, and US companies have more cash on hand that at any time in history.

Google search "systematic and idiosyncratic risk."  Bitcoin has a massive amount of the latter, little of the former, which means it is very low risk as a tiny percentage of a diversified portfolio, but one of the highest risk assets you can own by itself.
Unlike the dollar, bitcoin has a very real risk of being worth zero or near-zero at any time, even tomorrow.  All it would take for that to happen would be any government or individual with a couple billion dollars deciding to destroy bitcoin and they could do so almost immediately by hijacking the network.  Lots of ways they could do this.  Remember, bitcoin is almost entirely centralized; 3 mining pools control the network, and so someone like the NSA could easily cajole/hack/bribe/coerce 2 of the 3 to take control of the network if they didn't feel like building/buying their own GUIs to do so.
   Since all assets in the US are priced in USD, if the USD fell, all other assets would go up in USD terms.  So if you had some USD but also some stocks and bonds and real estate, all that other stuff would go up linearly with the dollar's decline.  Not so for bitcoin, which could explode from its idiosyncratic risk, regardless of what the USD does.

You're thinking of bitcoin as a technology.  In that regard, I don't doubt that you understand it better than him.  But I bet good money that he understands bitcoin as an investment far better than you.  Because Buffett understands consumers' "pain points" and incentives, he understands merchant behavior, he understands payment networks, financial infrastructures, and regulatory frameworks (both of the financial sector and regulator behavior in general).  
For example, in evaluating whether consumers will adopt bitcoin, you can speak to its technological advantages.  But Buffett better understands consumer psychology, and also he understands how banks and credit card companies are likely to react if BTC ever becomes a real threat.  For example, Visa could easily switch over to a blockchain based backbone and drop their fees to near zero.  If they wanted to, they could also offer the option of irreversible transactions.  Then, why would a merchant or a consumer switch from using Visa (which they already trust and are familiar with) to bitcoin, if both are the same price and offer similar features?  Just an example of why evaluating Bitcoin extends far beyond technology.

There's a big difference between understanding a technology itself and a tech company.  I have no doubt you understand the code and the engineering of specific products far better than him.  But I think he's far better than you at identifying the economics surrounding those products.  Let's use bitcoin for example.  Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever he is, clearly knows bitcoin better than Buffett.  But I would still bet that Buffett will be a better gauge of the value of bitcoin and what will drive it's medium and long-term price changes than Satoshi.  Buffett understands what drives consumer habits in a financial context; he understands banking and payment processing and merchant incentives, and "pain points" of consumers in dealing with financial transactions.  He understands the economics and politics of the remittances industry, how regulatory authorities are likely to respond etc etc...Satoshi might be able to write a book about how bitcoin can be great for remittances from a technological perspective, but Buffett might know that specific regulators will block it, or how Western Union will enhance their "moat" etc...

I like your last couple paragraphs, and don't disagree that someone can easily and comfortably live on quite a small amount of money.  But...remember that you were only paying for yourself.  Imagine supporting a family of 4, so that $700/m on food becomes $2800/m, and you need a lot more space for your family so your rent at least doubles, a second car, and toys and maybe supplementary education experiences for the kids, etc.  
And a lot depends on where you live.  I live in Chicago and have roots here.  Most of my friends live/work/play downtown.  It's almost impossible for me to go out with friends without spending $100 a pop (dinner + a cab + a drink).  Sure I could live a lot more cheaply in a more rural area, but that would be a sacrifice.  I work downtown and choose to live downtown as well to minimize my commute, so my rent is $2k a month.  If I lived a bit further away from the city center I could find a place for $1k a month, but then I'd also be giving up at 90 minutes a day in commuting time (i.e. less freedom).
And then there's medical expenses.  If you don't have an employer paying your health-insurance and need to get your own, your real effective costs are something like 10k a year (far less when you're young and healthy, but will be far more when you're older and sick).  The point being, $1.5 million is really not feasible for a family of 4 to retire on.

Your last sentence is your best argument.  The US's debt levels (both as a whole, and even only if looking at the sovereign balance sheet) are fine.  Europe's and Japan's are not.  Japan is fundamentally in a dangerous scenario; for Europe it's more of a political issue.  Greece's debt issues are trivial when compared to the wealth of Europe.  To put it in perspective, Bill Gates alone could single handedly finance Greek debt for the next decade without breaking a sweat.  And much of Europe (like Germany) look very healthy.  The issue is can they create a stable monetary union out of countries with very different productivity levels, and I don't know.  Most likely they'll keep doing what they're doing (which is basically what US states do for one another to deal with same issue), fiscal transfers via a federal mechanism.  In the US we redistribute wealth geographically with federal programs and federal taxation.  In Europe they're doing it through subsidized sovereign loans.  
  So, Japan could certainly face a monetary crisis and needs superhuman efforts to avoid one.  Europe could potentially face a crisis, but it easily might not if their bankers/politicians act intelligently.
   If both Europe and Japan face major crises simultaneously, the US economy will certainly be hurt.
   You're right that the current debt and monetary situation is unprecedented.  But so is the policy response.  I made an awful bet from late 2009 to late 2010 that the recovery was a dead cat bounce and we were doomed for a major deflationary recession.  I didn't think Bernanke had either the political will or knowledge to print the staggering amounts of money that were necessary to offset the insane drop in the velocity of money.  But...I was wrong.  Central bankers around the world are printing the money necessary to effectively restructure the excessive debt.  The US did it first, which is why we've been enjoying modest growth.  Europe is finally joining the party.  The massive money printing creates all sorts of inefficiencies, corruption, and may eventually create a risk of hyperinflation.  But...it is the correct policy response to what was disastrous levels of debt back in 2008, and it's mostly succeeded in allowing for a "beautiful deleveraging" (in the words of Ray Dalio, head of Bridgewater and arguably the best investor of all time.)  
  What are the biggest risks today?  A Japanese crisis is a real risk.  A populist reaction in the US (tea party style) that forces fiscal austerity would be disastrous.  Europe poses the potential for several didn't types of crisis; their banking system is still insanely overleveraged, almost as bad as in 2008.  But most of these things would just produce your run-of-the-mill once a decade crisis.  Equities might fall 35% and we'd get a recession, but nothing particularly unusual or dramatic.  My biggest concern is actually severe inflation (probably not hyper, but 10%+), which would cause a re-pricing of all assets based on discounting future cash flows at a higher rate.  Even if the economy itself is unaffected, equity prices could fall 50% purely from the higher discount rate, and obviously bonds would get destroyed.  The inflationary scenario (if it happens) is at least 2 years off before it becomes severe.  But as an investor, my thinking is that at the first hint of even a tiny bit of inflation, the market will react strongly, so I'm trying to figure out how to position ahead of time.  It's tough because all the usual hedges (gold, equities, real estate, commodities) are already up 300%+.  Hard to like buying something after such a strong run.

If Buffett had bought an ad on TV saying he thought BTC would fail, that might be evidence in your favor.  But he hasn't gone out of his way to talk about BTC.  He was asked about it, so he gave a concise answer of his opinion.  As far as I know, he doesn't have a history of making statements to benefit his holdings.  On the contrary, he has often said that specific businesses he owns stink (like the original manufacturing company Berkshire) and that they face stiff competition from specific competitors.

I'm still not following your remonetization argument.  Your first option (rational market forces), could happen with any asset at any time.  It didn't happen in 2008.  It didn't happen in the last 30 years.  It might happen with a collapse of the Yen, but that's not a choice a government can make.  In other words, there's no "verb" here.  Remonetizing in this context is just a byproduct of investors buying more gold.  Governments couldn't "trigger" remonetization in this sense except by buying up huge amounts of gold and bidding through the market.
Your second option makes no sense.  Countries can't simply "recognize" gold at a higher price.  The reason the price of gold is what it is right now is because at higher prices there are more sellers than buyers.  If a bunch of countries announced that gold was now $3,000 an ounce, the immediate response would be, "how much will you buy from me at that price?"  And if they're not willing to buy at $3,000 an ounce, they'd simply be laughed at.  It'd be like me claiming that crude oil is worth $400 a barrel.  If I'm not actually willing to pay that price, I'm just pulling a number out of my ass and I"ll be ignored.  If this consortium of countries was actually willing to pay $3000 an ounce, they would quickly find a huge supply of sellers until the price was again pushed back down.  Of course, if the US wanted to sell other assets (basically issue more debt) to keep pushing the price of gold higher, they certainly could, but that would be a strange and unprecedented choice.
The price of gold is set by supply and demand.  Unless there is a huge amount of new buying (by either governments or investors), the price won't move.  The only way that governments can move the price of gold directly is by 1. buying it, or 2. Doing some sort of peg which indirectly buys gold (e.g. if the US government pegs an ounce of gold as worth $3,000, then I will immediately convert my gold into USD at that price and force the government to buy it from me.)
"Recognition" is just a greater fool argument.  You'd just be speculating that other people will value something at more than it's valued at today.  Yes, gold's value is arbitrary, so it could arbitrarily be bid up to $20,000 an ounce...same thing can happen with Pogs and Chanel handbags, and anything else that people decide to bid up.  You're writing as though people have forgotten about gold.  We had some form of a gold standard until 1971.  We abandoned it for a bunch of reasons.  But it's not like some big secret.  
So I agree that gold could shoot higher in price.  And I agree that some countries could decide to peg to gold.  But neither of those things is at all inevitable.  It's also possible that the world continues the long-term trend of moving away from commodity forms of money and towards more sophisticated forms of fiat.  And so gold falls in price to replacement cost with the only demand coming jewelry/industrial uses, currently about $600 an ounce.

Again, I think you're getting confused by the concept of "broke."  The US is a $14 trillion economy.  It's the opposite of broke.  Part of the reason our government is borrowing so much money is because the world is throwing it at us.  If I could borrow crazy amounts of money for 30 years at 3% interest, I would too...but even then, we're not really "borrowing" it, since the Fed is instantly monetizing it.  
And our currency is on the brink of collapse?  What are you smoking?  USD is in such high demand we had to set up special bilateral swaps with other banks to provide it.  Our currency is the exact opposite of on the brink of collapse.  It's the global reserve currency, and in greater demand than ever...as you can see by just looking at a chart of the USD against anything...against EUR, against Yen, and RMB, or even against gold/silver/crude oil etc.

"transactions" is kind of broad.  If you mean purchases of goods or services (which GDP measures), then you must mean micropayments.  # of transactions isn't relevant on its own, i.e. ten $1 transactions are equivalent to one $10 transaction for all practical purposes in this discussion.  
I think it's extremely likely that micropayments will become more popular and so the # of transactions will rise sharply, but this doesn't actually increase the velocity of money, if the increase in transaction number is offset exactly by a decrease in their size.  In a scenario where micropayments take off, it's quite likely that as a % of transaction  that digital currency becomes a very large percentage.  But that doesn't make it more meaningful.  To take a really extreme example, imagine that every time you visited any website, you had to pay 0.00000000001 BTC.  The # of transactions in BTC would be astronomical, but that would not meaningfully diminish the role of fiat, nor would it directly lead to BTC appreciation.

Many economists argue that the great depression was "great" specifically because we were still on the gold standard (and so was much of the world, which is partly why our depression was transmitted to them).

No one argued that a strong military prevents inflation.  Also, debating this point via anecdotes isn't all that great; we run the risk of generalizing from exceptions. 
What does a "strong currency" mean to you?  Does "strong" mean that the economy has not experienced substantial inflation in the last 5 or 10 or 20 years?  Or is it a reference to relative exchange rates, purchasing power parity, or money printing (even if it doesn't generate inflation or depreciation)?

Of course it does, in all sorts of ways.  Why does Hawaii and New Mexico use the USD?  Because the US military conquered those places and forced them to.  Basically pick any spot in the world, and the fiat it uses is that of the strongest military that chose to conquer it.
More subtly though, the military backs the economic system which gives the currency value.  The US military ensures that commodities we want like oil are sold on the global capitalist market; when foreign countries try not to, we invade.  If we didn't, there might be a Soviet Ruble that was today stronger than the USD.

The very phrasing of, "operation to control bitcoin" suggests you know little about markets.  No trader or investor or even market manipulator would ever phrase it like that.
First, manipulation happens all the time in every market.  It's mostly irrelevant and consists of things like traders pushing a product a few basis points to trigger stop limit orders.  In something as illiquid as bitcoin where some people use lots of margins, this kind of thing can cause larger swings, but it's extremely short-term in nature.  Like, one trader could force BTC $15 lower on one exchange to trigger stop limit orders, but then the price would bounce back within minutes.  
Let me try to break down the problem with your statement.
"Operation" - this suggests a coordinated effort.  While individual traders will certainly try to manipulate all assets for their gain, it's very rarely coordinated because people are greedy (and so backstab each other) and secrets are hard to keep.  In bitcoin it's even less likely to be coordinated because the dollar amounts are so tiny.  If I have a few million dollars I can manipulate bitcoin myself, so why would I need to put together some big syndicate?  And the people with the most interest in manipulating bitcoin have enough money to do it easily themselves.
The groups that would work in coordination to manipulate bitcoin would simply destroy it if they wanted to.  It's unlikely the NSA would go to the trouble of doing complex trades in the bitcoin market when they have so many faster and easier methods that they're more familiar with for shutting down financial enterprises they dislike.  
Then there's the term, "control."  It's ambiguous to the point of meaningless.  For a while people were claiming that evil forces were pushing the price of bitcoin down.  And basically those people simply didn't understand that there are millions of BTC held by people who want to monetize their gains and buy mansions and yachts and stuff.  There doesn't need to be some evil syndicate to explain a price fall - all it takes is for a couple of the big BTC holders to look to diversify or monetize their wealth.
Taken as a whole, your statement is the equivalent of saying, "Major forces may be encouraging crime."  It's so ambiguous as to be meaningless while carrying a stupid conspiracy twinge.  If you interpret the statement in it's mildest form, it's certainly true and obvious.  Are there people trying to manipulate bitcoin?  Of course, lots of them, just as there are lots manipulating crude oil and Microsoft stock at this very moment.  Is it possible that 2 dudes might be coordinating their efforts?  Of course.  So what?

Government spending (which will always be in fiat) is about 35% of GDP.  Then whoever receives that 35% as payment will spend a chunk of it; they'll spend even more if they want to get rid of fiat, so let's conservatively say they spend 1/3.  That means that a bare minimum of about 47% of all currency being used will have to be fiat.  I can think of extreme scenarios where that number drops substantially, but they're quite far-fetched.

Iraq turned out to be very different than almost anyone expected; we didn't realize how much animosity different Iraqi groups had against one another and how unsuited they were to run their own democracy.  Personally I'm ambivalent if it was the right move, in retrospect.  But that's hindsight bias.  
As for responsibility - there's no simple answer.  Some people think that if you see a man drowning in a river and there's a rope at your side that you have a responsibility to throw it to the drowning man to save him.  Similarly, as the world's wealthiest and strongest country, some people think we have a moral responsibility to try to stop genocides where we can.  Others disagree...
  As for the right - I'd look at it from the other angle.  You have a brutal dictator who's people hate him.  Why *can't* we depose him?  Who's rights are we violating by ending his genocidal regime?  There are plenty of arguments against doing so (i.e. it costs american lives and american money and may cause people in the region to hate us, etc...) but none of those suggest we lack the *right* to put an end to a brutal dictator.

Not saying he's infallible. 
He understands tech companies better than you or I or 99.999% of the world (including most tech specialists).  He just doesn't understand them quite as well as he understands banks and consumer goods companies.  Also, his saying that he doesn't understand tech is kind of a gentle and less combative way of saying that they're generally bad investments because there's more randomness to future cash flows.  E.g. no matter how well you understand Uber, you can't accurately predict the risk of a major technological discovery that disrupts their business model.  
If he truly didn't understand bitcoin, he would say so, or he would say he has no opinion.  I'd wager he knows more about the blockchain than 99% of people on this sub.

Buffett became a billionaire because he seeks to falsify his ideas.  He rigorously researches things that could disrupt the industries he invests in.  I'd wager he understands bitcoin better than you or I.  Just as he understood the tech companies better than almost anyone in 1998.  When he says he doesn't invest in what he doesn't understand, he really means that no one can accurately model future cash flows for those types of companies.

It certainly weakens demand for dollars, but doesn't eliminate it.  The key point is that there will always be a massive demand for dollars simply because of taxes.  In contrast, it's easily imaginable for demand for bitcoin to be zero in a year.  Or for demand for silver or diamonds to plummet to 5% of what it is currently.  
And no, the military isn't irrelevant.  The US military forces the US economic system on the world.  If a country tries to ban our products, we overthrow their leaders (see much of South American history from 1900 to 1990).

You're certainly right that "something" has to be done about the debt, and it is...it's being depreciated away.  That's what quantitative easing is.  The Federal Reserve bought up a huge portion of the debt outstanding which has 3 separate effects.  First, by buying the debt with newly printed money it means that no real buyer for it needs to be found (and so government borrowing doesn't crowd out corporate or individual borrowing like it normally would).  Second, it forces interest rates lower which reduces the debt servicing costs.  And third, it causes a depreciation of the currency and inflation which reduces the real value of the debt outstanding.
Now, you're probably thinking: Hey!  the dollar didn't depreciate, it appreciated relative to other currencies.  And there's no inflation in sight.  And you'd be right...the Fed's actions produced "relative" depreciation and inflation, meaning relative to what would have otherwise happened.  Without the massive quantitative easing programs, we would have had a deflationary depression where the real value of debt oustanding would have exploded and causes a crisis.  My best guess is some time in the not terribly distant future (maybe in 6 months, maybe in 5 years) we'll get moderate inflation and so our "unsustainable debt" will simply get mitigated by moderate inflation.
As for benefit of new debt - I think about it a bit differently.  The primary goal of government debt issuance isn't to increase productivity.  Sure, many politicians and a couple of economists will argue that, but economic consensus for 60+ years is that the return on government spending is negative.  The government spends for political reasons - basically to redistribute wealth.  Debt issuance is just a question of the timing of taxation.  We issue debt to avoid raising taxes today.  I'm oversimplifying slightly, but that's mostly true.  There's two separate issues - government spending, and the decision to print/tax/borrow.

You don't understand the argument.  Fiat has value because citizens of that country *must* have it or they go to jail.  If you don't pay your taxes in USD, you got to jail.  It doesn't matter how much gold or BTC or diamonds or land you have, if you don't have USD you're poor and you're headed for a prison cell.  The military power of the US is relevant in that it protects US economic interests abroad.  Think of the countries that have tried to avoid the global US economic system - North Korea, Cuba...we isolate them militarily and thus economically and they don't do well.

You really think that lobbying is inherently corrupt?  You realize that lobbying is just an individual or company spending money to convince a politician of something right?

Personally I think all donations from companies should be 100% transparent (no hiding behind shells and PACs and stuff).

The "getting things in return" is the tricky thing.  We've decided that you as an individual have a constitutional right to do with your money as you see fit - including giving it to a politician you support.  Of course that can create conflicts of interest, and I would personally support more restrictions on the giving; like it'd be easy to follow the trend of the finance industry and ban anything resembling a personal gift of over $200.  
In lots of countries, you have tens of millions of dollars changing hands.  In the US, its usually measured in the thousands or rarely, tens of thousands.  A corrupt US senator might hope to accumulate a few hundred grand over a few years.  In China or Nigeria, you have mid-level guys raking in tens of millions they move to swiss bank accounts.

There's no one answer.  Gold is a legacy of recent history when many countries did peg their currency to gold or used gold directly as a currency.  And of course there's a political issue - any politician who suggested selling our gold assets would get crucified.  But of course, the flip side doesn't work - why hasn't the US bought more gold?  Why doesn't the US spend $500 billion and accumulate a substantial percentage of the world's gold outstanding?  Why don't the world's wealthiest people or largest companies bother owning meaningful amounts of gold?  
   Why have China's gold purchases been completely trivial relative to their holdings of USD or US treasuries, or GDP?  Why aren't any countries (even those aggressively accumulating foreign reserves) buying meaningful amounts of gold?  
  In the scenario I envision (of continued global competitive currency devaluation), gold probably performs well.  But...gold has historically been a mediocre inflation hedge, has underperformed every other asset class over the last 100 years, and is up 4x over the last 15 years.

For much of history, amateur (or very small time) prop traders would make a living by picking up nickels behind the whales as you describe.  Over time, more and more of that trade was replaced by algorithms.  They can look at all the metrics you're seeing and many more and make instantaneous decisions.  Of every 10 prop traders around in 2004, there are 2 left, and both are making less money than they were 10 years ago.  
Today, 90% of all volume in most major markets is algorithmic.  Whales execute orders via sophisticated VWAP and TWAP programs, some of which even act like prop traders themselves and do thing like throw up fake orders in the opposite direction.
Can some people still make a little money the way you describe?  Sure.  But not many, and not much.  By "not much" I mean relative to professional market makers on wall street etc.

You did a weird switch in the second to last sentence.  Yes Buffett likes using insurance float (effectively giving him leverage), but the assets he buys are mostly just brick and mortar businesses (like Nebraska Furniture Mart, See's Candies etc).  Those are just simple businesses.  Now, bitcoin isn't a business.  It produces no cash flows.  It's not an investment in that sense.  Nor is it a consummable commodity with intrinsic value.  It's not even quite like gold, which at least as natural demand for both industrial and jewelry purposes.  As such, there's no way to come up with a "fair" value, since there are no future cash flows to discount.  That means it's inherently speculative.  It's a bet on what other people will think it's worth in the future.

Two separate issues here.  First is, the restaurant I spend my BTC at has no idea where I got it from (they're not going to perform a complex trace while preparing my food), and even if they do, they still have no idea who I am.  If I mined the coins myself or got the coins from an anonymous miner, then at no point in time are the BTC connected to a name.  They are anonymous.  And of course this isn't some sort of far fetched scenario.  **all** coins come from a miner, and it's not hard to find BTC that haven't passed through a domain that requires ID.
"And if the person you paid to pick it up is compromised, what then? This why drug kingpins get busted, links."

Most of your evidence of how the fiat system is failing was simply objectively wrong...  Back in 2008, people said, "you'll soon see how all this money printing will destroy the economy."

Yes you could transfer the code you use to generate the paper wallet and to sign transactions on a piece of paper and type it in yourself to a new computer.  But really?  That's your feasible solution?  To have every person who wants to use bitcoin have to program the code on to their air-gapped computer?  And of course, even then, you're forgetting that your air-gapped computer could have come pre-installed with malicious code that edits your input.  So, you'd have to either check the code, or verify the output.  Basically, your idea of "securing" bitcoin is to be a professional programmer putting tons of time into even the simplest use of bitcoin.
And this is not a hypothetical threat.  I don't wear tin foil hats.  This has **already** been used to steal thousands of bitcoins.  Chinese USB drives have been found to come pre-installed with malware that changes public keys you enter into websites like coinbase or merchant websites when you want to spend your bitcoins.

This is completely wrong.  First off, "necessity" doesn't drive investment outcomes, supply and demand does.  **if** bitcoin succeeds, the most likely outcome is that it succeeds as a modest store of a value, like a very distant inflation hedge to gold and silver.  Fiat isn't going away, because governments control the military, and the military determines what has to be used to pay taxes etc.  I am betting that bitcoin will become a substantial method of payment and store of value, in which case its value will probably end up between $3,000 and $10,000 per BTC imo.

Nope.  What you're missing is that just as all high stakes poker players are trying to employ the same skills of probability, game theory, and hand reading, so to are all large market participants trying to buy and sell at optimal prices by identifying what other market participants will do.  And just as game theory will "work" for half of poker players and fail to make the other half money (since its a zero sum game), TA will work for half of market participants and fail the other half.  Of course "half" is an oversimplification, but hopefully you get the point.
The reason professional financial firms have made money off of "computerized TA" is that they beat the other people who lost tons of money with the same goal.  The winners used smarter alogorithms, lower latency (like with co-location and now microwave towers) etc.
If you ask Renaissance and similar firms how they made their billions, they'd never say TA...because they're not retarded.  They explain that they mostly do what all the losers are trying to do, just slightly faster or more accurately.  So it's not the technique itself that makes them money, it's doing the same thing better.  If everyone else stopped trading, the winning firms like Renaissance couldn't make any money.

1. "investigation"?  lol
2.  We have no idea.  Lots of ways to spend bitcoin anonymously.  For example, I can walk into any of the many wonderful restaurants that accept bitcoin and spend them completely anonymously.  For larger sums there are of course websites that will accept BTC with no ID in exchange for large sums of gold, or you can just trade P2P.
3.  Yes.  When you say, "x" is anonymous, it means that the thing in and of itself is anonymous.  So if someone can steal and spend bitcoin completely anonymously than obviously BTC is anonymous.  The fact that in other cases BTC, or physical cash, could be tied to a person doesn't change that fact.  It's like, if I steal physical USD, obviously those are anonymous, but if I try to spend them at a store that requires ID, then it becomes de-anonymized at that point.
Hopefully that helps.

I think you're confusing money creation with inflation.  "capital" in a very basic economic sense is stuff that you use to make more stuff.  Like, agricultural land is capital because it grows commodities you can sell.  A factory is capital because it makes furniture etc.  A factory that can be bought/sold for $1 million is identical to $1 million in cash; they can be exchanged for one another.  So $1 million in cash is just as much "capital" as is the factory.  
Your objection is that the $1 million in cash is being created either through fractional reserve banking, or through the Federal Reserve's printing press.  If either of those things create inflation, then the value of the money will decrease, and so the same amount of money will be able to buy fewer factories.  In other words, it may soon require $2 million to buy the same factory.  If that happens, your original $1 million is still capital, but only half as much, since now it only has the productive capacity of half of a factory.
If the Federal Reserve's money printing or the fractional reserve banking system create new cash but it **doesn't** produce inflation, then there's no objection.  If I can turn $1 million into a factory, it doesn't matter where it came from.  That $1 million is still capable of being turned into a factory and producing the same amount of furniture as before.  Money is fungible.  
The short version: Money is worth exactly what you can buy with it.  If you can buy a productive factory with it, then it is capital.

Professional traders don't look at a volume and price hardly at all anymore.  To the extent that you can profit off those things, algorithms do it, since they can incorporate all of the information and make a decision instantly.  
Professional traders are either market makers (profiting from the bid/ask spread and short-term mean reversion in less liquid markets), arbitrageurs, or benefiting from a structural advantage like cheaper capital, lower latency, personal contacts in a very illiquid market etc..  The # of people doing old school click trading has collapsed in the last 10 years; very few people still do it, and those that do barely make any money.

You haven't thought this through.  First, taking on debt to pay it back with BTC later only works if BTC is guaranteed to go up between the time you issue the debt and buy it.  But in your scenario, the BTC price has *already* increased.  Second, that wouldn't render existing debt worthless, any more than an 4x increase in the price of gold decreased the value of existing debt.  One asset increasing in value does not inherently decrease the value of another asset.

Wrong.  As I explained, the only reason any of the abstractions of chess (like material advantage or positional advantage) have any relevance at all is because we're unable to "solve" chess and calculate the impact of a move through the end of the game.  "Positional advantage" is not inherently meaningful in the context of chess.  A perfect chess playing computer would never consider "positional advantage", it would simply play the move every turn that will indefensibly result in checkmate x moves later.  At times that move would result in a material disadvantage (a sacrifice), and would often appear to produce a position disadvantage based on strategy heuristics (e.g. sometimes the best move is to sacrifice the middle of the board, or double your pawns.)  Chess hasn't been quite solved yet, but it's close.  Some simpler games like checkers have been truly solved, meaning a computer has modeled every possible sequence of moves and can identify at every turn the move(s) that are part of a sequence that will result in its win however many moves later.
And no, all high stakes poker players know the probability like the back of their hand, and all major market participants have access to "world-class" TA.  Saying that probability lets you make money at poker or that TA lets you make money trading is like saying that learning how to use a gas pedal lets you become a professional race car driver.

Some services automatically label the coins and the coins retain the label no matter how many times they're transffered.  For example, if you go to blockchain.info, all the Silk Road confiscated bitcoins are labeled as such and will be forever (unless they manually unlabel them).
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:33:51
Those figures are way off.
   First, more than 100% of all BTC has flowed through Silk Road and its successors.  That's how "Dread Pirate Roberts" accumulated more than 600k bitcoins.  The 2013 article makes a few mistakes.  First, they counted all bitcoin movement as "transactions", when obviously most (especially back in 2013) were just movements between wallets, not actual commercial transactions at all.  Back in 2013, there was almost zero legal commerce with BTC.  Almost no major retailers accepted it; even today legal commerce with BTC is probably &lt;$50m a year.  Second, the 50m is misleading and I'll go into why momentarily.
As for USD - we need to be careful comparing apples to apples.  The $1.34 trillion is accurate as a measure of physical cash, but a good chunk of that $400 billion illegal drug trade is transacted in Euros, Yuan, and Yen.  Also, at least some of it is transacted using money in an electronic format (e.g. wire transfers, cashier's checks, pseudo-anonymous swiss bank account deposits etc), so for that we'd need to look at the M2 supply of USD which is about $4 trillion (a figure that includes the USD in checking accounts.)
Getting exact figures on BTC is tough, but I'd summarize with this.  Silk Road alone had 600k BTC confiscated.  All of that was profits.  If we imagine they collected (an exaggerated) 5% of all transactions, then that means that 12 million BTC had to flow through Silk Road.  That's 100% of all BTC in existence over the course of 2 years.  And of course there were other competing sites.  In that same time, how much legitimate commerce was transacted in BTC?  very, very little.  The only other major commercial site was satoshi dice.

Lots of factual errors here.  First off, no coinbase is not functionally identical to a bank.  The basic premise of a bank is they profit by making commercial and personal loans with the deposits.
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:48:09
No of course it's not luck.  Let me try to take a different tack.
When people talk about chess they often talk about tactics (calculating out a small number of moves ahead) and strategy ( principles of play).  There's no actual distinction.  A chess move is good if it leads to checkmate of the opponent and bad if it doesn't.  Humans create the division of tactics vs strategy because we're unable to calculate 20 moves ahead, so we use heuristics like "control the center" and "develop pieces."  But those heuristics are just abstract generalizations; they don't actually mean anything in regard to chess itself.  A move either leads to checkmate or it doesn't.  In some situations controlling the center is important, in others it isn't, and all the abstractions we can apply to identifying when controlling the center is useful are similarly just abstractions for our benefit that have nothing to do with the chess itself.  
Similarly, a trade either makes money or it doesn't.  All market participants are trying to figure out when and where the market will move.  All major players are aware of both the "value" philosophy and "technical" factors.  They're all trying to beat each other in a zero sum game.  As a whole, the market will earn exactly the market return.  For everyone who outperforms, someone must underperform.  So as a whole, market participants can't be skilled and can't be unskilled in regard to outperforming the market.  As a whole, market participants will neither outperform nor underperform and are neither skilled nor unskilled.
Now let's consider a master TA trader named TAmmy.  If no one else actively trades, she can't make money.  If all the other market participants simply execute orders via TWAP and VWAP programs, TAmmy can't profit because there won't be any support or resistance or trends.  TAmmy can only profit if other market participants actively try to compete at the same game and pick specific price levels to buy and sell at.  When they do, there will be both TA winners and TA losers.
To finish up - I think of poker and TA as the games.  "poker" doesn't win me money, rather being better at specific tools that are used in poker lets me beat other poker players and make money.  Similarly, TA is just one arena in which players compete in financial markets, and those who are better at specific parts (like identifying meaningful resistance) will beat the other people using TA who are less skilled at it.  This is critical because it means that TA (and poker strategy) can never be viewed as static.  A "good" TA technique or a person who's "good" at TA are only good at that moment until their competitors adapt.  Like if a particular price is strong support and everyone is leaning on it, it will work until it doesn't.  If any one technique or pattern works consistently for a little while, it gets arbitraged away and then you can't make money with it.  This is why the famous "turtles" who traded commodities with momentum first got rich and then the strategy became completely useless for a decade and then started working again.  
TA is just an abstraction of identifying what other market participants (many of whom are also using TA) will do.  As such, studying TA is useless just as studying probability won't make you money at poker, because everyone knows the same probability and everyone knows the same TA.  To make money you have to simply do what everyone else is doing, just slightly sooner.

That's what a zero sum game implies.  Like in poker - there can be professionals who make money off of the bad players.  The point is that not everyone at a poker table can be "good" if we define "good" as making money.  And the average skill at making money playing poker in the world will always be exactly unchanged since any time one person gets better, everyone else is effectively slightly worse.  Now, the analogy isn't perfect since there are some elements of objective poker skill unrelated to making money (like calculating odds).  But in TA, either it works (i.e. makes money) or it doesn't.

My responsibilities include things like getting exercise, not smoking etc.  But...I can also buy life insurance.  The life insurance doesn't keep me healthy.  The life insurance isn't responsible for keeping me healthy.  Rather, the life insurance is **insurance** that kicks in if I fail in my responsibilities so my kids have money if I die early.  
Similarly, if a person fails (or chooses not to) take responsibility for securing their money, insurance (like FDIC insurance) will make them whole.

Why haven't consumers adopted bitcoin while merchants have?  Because bitcoin solves a "pain point" for merchants (i.e. chargebacks and fees), but none for consumers who don't consciously experience the higher prices and who like having the chargeback option.

I don't know any facts about this, but neither I nor anyone I know use debit cards for anything except ATM cash withdrawals.  My intuition is that the only people who still use debit cards for non-cash withdrawals are the poor who don't have credit cards.  When using a credit card, you get both some sort of rewards (however meager, but you can easily get at least 1% cash back), and fraud protection, and there's no downside to the consumer usually.  Merchants end up paying a higher fee, but consumers are rarely given a discount for paying by debit card.

When politicians decide on a plan of action that they think is the right thing to do, they then need to sell it.  The selling often involves embellishment or even lies at the margin.

But the big point is Saddam basically **announced** he had WMD.  All he had to do to prevent invasion was let UN weapons inspectors confirm that he didn't have WMD.  If he didn't have WMD, why wouldn't he let them in?  It was common sense to be confident he had WMD, because what kind of idiot would commit suicide for no reason at all?  It turns out Saddam was such an egomaniac that he was willing to risk death at the hands of the US to give the impression that he was more powerful than he actually was.

This is like trying to distinguish between tactics and strategy in chess.  The distinction is useful for the human chess student, but it's a pure artificial construction.  Strategy is just heuristics for tactics that are too complex to calculate.  Similarly, even long-term investors rarely hold an asset for the cash flow.  A value investor like Seth Klarman might be a stock for $40, hold it for 5 years in which he collects $5 in dividends, and then sell it for $80.  He was an investor because the premise behind his purchase was that he was buying a discounted stream of future cash flows at an excellent price, but to earn the kind of very attractive returns that he does, he's hoping the market "comes to its senses" fairly quickly so he can make "quick" capital gains and re-invest in something else substantially undervalued.
At the end of the day, it's just about making money.  Investors simply apply a different philosophy to identifying which assets will appreciate.

The only reason this is limited to small amounts is that BTC isn't accepted all that many places.  
There are also websites that will ship large amounts of gold to a fake name/address of your choosing in exchange for BTC.  It's **slow** and **hard** to cash out large quantities of BTC anonymously because not many places accept it yet, but it's doable.

This is like saying, "a man was stabbed with a knife so it's dumb for surgeons to use scalpels to repair his body."  Econ 101 is a recession is usually caused by a lack of demand, and so stimulating demand is the remedy.

No, you're not getting the distinction.  It's theoretically possible for all doctors to be excellent at treating patients.  It's not possible for all poker players to make money.  For every winner there's a loser.  Traders used to mostly pick up the nickels that whales dropped.  But the whales now execute trades using dark pools, and sophisticated TWAP and VWAP programs.  So, prop traders are now mostly out of business and those that are left are either picking up structural nickels (e.g. being paid to provide short-term liquidity, effectively market making etc), or competing against one another like a bunch of poker players at a table.
All of the "skill" of TA (e.g. looking at quantifiable variables of chart patterns, volume, momentum etc) have simply been fed into computers that can execute on them far better than people and instantaneously.  That's why hedge funds like Renaissance have made more than $20 billion over the last decade.  The computers at that one fund probably made more than all the pathetic charters on the planet put together in the same time period.

The correct private key could show up on your screen, and not match the private key submitted.

You have to understand that it's a zero sum game.  Tautologically it can't work.  All that can happen is some traders beat other traders.  It doesn't matter at all if you are "good" at TA, all that matters is that you do what everyone else is doing, just slightly before them.  As a whole, people can't get better or worse at TA, since TA is literally doing what everyone else does but slightly sooner.

zzzz.  The myth that Bush lied about Iraq is just silly.  Every intelligence agency in the world was sure Saddam had wmd.  Saddam freakin told us he had wmd.

We've learned that no matter how sophisticated you are, your BTC are NEVER safe.  Your hard disk could have come pre-installed with an undetectable virus from the manufacturer.

It'd be really easy for the NSA to destroy bitcoin if they wanted.  They could simply become 50%+ of the hashing power very easily (via hacking the largest miners, coercing them, bribing them, etc).
