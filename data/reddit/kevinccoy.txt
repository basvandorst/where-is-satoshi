Creative design.
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:22:37
Do you actually tired it?
@_date: 2016-03-14 15:15:51

Never had such problem, but maybe email them or try another wallet.
@_date: 2016-03-18 15:45:30
Probably will

There many other bigger criminal things in this world, but bitcoin ain't one of them
@_date: 2016-03-11 17:17:48
There's several reasons: It’s fast, it's cheap, it’s as private as you want it to be, you own it and can use for many more purposes. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 10:48:24
Shame on you FBI
@_date: 2016-03-18 18:36:23
Yeah, nicely done, this pointing the real problem.
@_date: 2016-03-13 12:11:14
