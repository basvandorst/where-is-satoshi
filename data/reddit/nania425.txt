Reports like these are, what keeps me from trusting coinbase with my money.

I think it is a bot, actually. Probably nets quite the µBTC.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:36:34
Well, that is the difficult thing about Mt. Gox. Maybe turn it into BTC again and try somewhere else?

There are some BTC accepting charity's around there. I think  is one of them. You may want to give them a small amount.

So, you lost our file (I assume deleted), and kept using the machine instead of securing the data (i.e. your hard drive)? Forget about it then.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:54:12
Oh please, no facebook in here.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:37:16
Referral spam.

That smiley looks terrifying. Not possible to smile for me that way.

For quite a lot of people "a couple hundred" is quite a lot of money. Idiot.

If it is a 20 character keepass password, there is not viable way to crack it directly.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:33:58
It is a scam. Move along.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:36:36
While you are right, you can not will BTC as a currency into existence. We need more things to buy with it, only then the  price might stabilize.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:59:56
Primus, it is not a democracy.
Secundus, the vote is not representative.
Tertio, Why should the BTC "community" decide what happens with the currency?
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:27:23
You may want to take a look at this: 
Nothing about if they send BTC or not, but if the rest is rather.. odd.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:05:09
Well, you have been scammed.

It is good to see Bitcoin adapted by the great and powerful industry of.. well I don't know what it is, but it is good.

I am not really sure if actual miners care much for the looks of their miner GUIs.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:22:58
What do you mean with "a task"?
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:19:07
How long has the machine been running since april?
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:17:33
I have been watching /new for 20 minutes now. Spam, all the way down.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:41:53
Stop your referral spam every evening.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:31:11
Why do people keep linking articles they hate? I don't get it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:26:11
Well, if you can do a disk dump, I will give it a try.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:35:53
Maybe the worst typo in the history of that site?
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:31:24
I took a look at the FAQ:

A bitcoin address does not change. Ever.

First of all, it is a lie. That site has been online for two weeks +-3 days.
Second, The sites payout is much lower than it claims to be  - the rolls are not fair. A user analyzed it a few days ago. Here is the link:
Basically, a referral scheme.
