 "Edit: Hi everyone, thank you for the replies. A few things: I'm looking to hodl for now, but was asking this question in case if I needed to sell for whatever reason and needed an emergency exit. "
The best way to hodl is to not know how to sell. Your ignorance is actually an asset and you are about to lose it.

Haha ,  no they dont . Trust me,  I'm in Zimbabwe and can tell you that most people have not heard about or are very skeptical about Bitcoin. In fact , not many are on reddit !! Internet is used by most for Whatsapp and Facebook. It's the few people who were using USD for cross border payments through banks  who have now been pushed to use BTC simply because banks wont facilitate their USD transactions anymore. These people dont care about Satoshi's white paper and have no hatred for Fiat. In fact people here looove the USD like crazy. To them BTC is the next best thing to USD. I tried telling some people the other day that the USD has been losing value for decades and will one day collapse and people looked at me like I was crazy. We love USD when we can get our hands on it and yes we still live in mud huts and eat termites , now if you will excuse me I have to go back to sharpening my spear,  i have some hunting to do and 3 wives to feed   . . .

You've might want to factor in inflation as well,  BTC may truly go up to $500k  like you predict. but I also predict that in 20 years time 500k  will buy me as many loaves of bread as i can buy with 15k today. In other words Lambos will be a couple trillion dollars, . The millionnaires of today, will be the quadrillionnaires of that time, Sorry guys, no Lambos for you even if bitcoin goes up to a million.

I agree wholeheartedly. In my view there are three things that need to happen for this to occur.
1. An end to the Bitcoin price volatility.
2. More people earning their salaries in Bitcoin and possibly paying taxes in BTC 
3. Sellers quoting their prices in sats.
Bitcoin is volatile, fiat is not. Any seller with a brain would rather quote their prices in a stable currency. So even if Amazon ebay and alibaba start accepting bTC , they would still quote in fiat . If you earn your salary in sats and pay your taxes in sats and buy your bread and milk in sats its then easier to think in sats.

I think you read that wrong. In 2009 Zimbabwe dropped their local currency and adopted the USD among a basket of other foreign currencies such as the South African Rand , British Pound and Euro. In June 2019 Gvt banned the use of USD forcing everyone to use Zimbabwe dollars.

It most certainly wont go up forever.  it will go up until it stops going up. Few people want to admit that it may have reached its peak. Why must it necesarily peak at 100k or  1 million, why can it not peak at 19k.

Hey wait a minute,  i thought bitcoin was governed by NOONE ???

Well maybe the bank knows something in the future that is coming and will make most people unable to "sit on the cash" Banks are not charities.

Can you explain how this is possible. I'm not disputing it's possiblity but trying to wrap my mind around how this can happen.
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:47:11
for all you know .. .yes , for all you know. You probably don't know much
@_date: 2019-01-23 05:28:14
haha , What exactly is the logic behind hodling forever.

I'm in Zimbabwe. Initially they blocked Whatsapp(the most popular social media platform in Zim),Twitter,Facebook  and Youtube, Zimbabweans are very quick to adapt almost everyone started using VPNs within a few days  so the gvt panicked and then pulled the plug on the entire internet.
@_date: 2019-01-23 06:22:18
The gvt will still nab you, At the end of it all you will still buy cars and houses with proceeds from your cute little "pwivacy coins" The gvt will simply ask you where you got the money from and tax that income.

True value ???  Bitcoin's value at any given point is its true value.
