Brah remember when it was $100 per BTC and people on the DNM were freaking out.

If was Kim Jong Un I'd allocate whatever resources I have left from my nuclear program to bitcoin theft/hacking. Then I'd go to dinner and theater with Dennis Rodman'.

Where exactly was I wrong?

Thanks for the write up. I'm starting to piece things together. Funnily enough I got into bitcoin during the Gox's days. Bought 10 for a $1000 for the lulz. When Mt Gox went insolvent I abandoned the whole bitcoin thing. Back then I just kept my coins in exchange (huge mistake obviously) and a few in an Android wallet. I don't remember there being a seed phrase option back then. Anyway I'm actually gonna take security seriously this time hence all the questions.

So when you use the desktop interface on your laptop the company doesn't have access to your coin's? I'm still kinda confused how all this works.
@_date: 2018-07-15 04:56:55
Honestly, bitcoin is dumb. It's not exactly feasible as a currency due to extreme volatility. Why would you hold on to a currency that can drop significantly at any given moment. The only people that use bitcoin are speculators mostly and guys buying drugs off DNMs. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 08:27:01
How many people on this sub actually use bitcoin for what it is rather than speculators trying to make money?
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:25:07


Lmao. Just a question regarding the hardware wallets by trezor and that other company. Is the wallet in anyway tied to those companies? I mean if trezor or whatever is compromised can hackers gain access to my coins.
