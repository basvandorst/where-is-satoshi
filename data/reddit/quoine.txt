Dear wohahaha, we hope that it'll never happen but in the event it happened, you are not liable to repay it.

Our customer support team should be communicating to you now regarding your issue, and I do apologise for any delays around this.
Delays may have been related to compliance investigations being undertaken by our team, where we can't maintain normal response levels, both in content of response and timeliness, to avoid 'tipping off'. You can google tipping off for further information on that subject.
 There are many things that can trigger a compliance flag, including unusual trading, deposit and withdrawal activity, large withdrawals relative to deposits, several deposits without trading inbetween, etc. I will not comment on your individual case as those details are private to you, but you are obviously free to comment on your account details such as original amount deposited, profits through trading, amount withdrawn etc.
Reduction of balance without notification should not have happened, and I was told that all customers were advised before this was done, so apologies if this was the case for you.
As communicated to customers affected, the issues experiences are due to a pricing error, and customers with affected trades have been contacted individually to explain the situation, and advised the affected trades will be cancelled.

You can't withdraw the initial deposit and the bonus, but whatever you have made on top of that can be withdrawn
