Don't forget.  Ron Paul is a paid spokesman for a CoinIRA.

When people on a r/bitcoin prefer paypal.   ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

One of the concerns I have with Bitcoin is many people don't really know how to keep their home computers secure.  At least not secure enough to hold a very valuable file.

Your 401(k) is usually diversified for long-term steady growth of 7-10%.  Your bitcoin speculation clearly outperformed that but it was a much higher level risk.

Imagine he added a sticker saying “Accepting cash tips”.  If you can't be convinced that it is at least an implied request for a tip, consider that with most P2P eCommerce sites like Ebay and airBNB, users are heavily messaged that doing business outside of the official payment channels will get them scammed.
I’d much prefer that bitcoin was offered in the Uber app, as a legitimate way to pay for the full transaction.  A secondary side transaction that Uber possibly wouldn't approve of is less than "Great Exposure".

Exactly.  It’s really difficult to look past the scammy get rich-quick-atmosphere surroundings bitcoin.  It may become a game changer asset class, but it also could be worth nothing in 5 years.

I wouldn't call this great exposure.  Uber Driver's are not supposed to request tips.  This driver is using bitcoin outside of the official Uber payment channel.  I don't see it as a big deal, but it does reinforce the unfair narrative that bitcoin is for unethical purchases.
I'm not saying this is bad or wrong,  just that this isn't the use case that I would want to introduce new user to bitcoin.

From the bet sequence, it doesn't look like he was unlucky.  If you make 20+ several 95% bets, your going to hit the 5% sooner or later.  But maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.
