Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed why the negativity. Most other people are nice on here.   Im trying to warn people about a phishing site .  im trying to help people.
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:59:21

I know my car wont increse in value as much as the barbies you invest in.
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:06:44
I get it i made a mistake and didnt take my time.   Ask your patents about mistakes they made a huge mistake by crearing your dumb ass. I  feel sorry for them having to deal with your dumb ass , then again they probably wernt around and thats why you turned out to be such a d bag.
@_date: 2019-11-01 22:17:13
Looks like the phishing link is showing up again.  So  after it says continue to your wallet the 24 word recovery seed box pops up.          The link is wallet.trezcr.com/trezor-one.html.   dont be stupid and fall for it like me.  On the google chrome search this site was right above the real official trezor site.
@_date: 2019-11-01 19:15:47
I will in a few days i dont want to mess anything up with the investigation.   The detective assigned to my case hasnt been able to review it he was in training today.   And i need the police report to send to the exchange to see if that leads me anywhere.    If $32k wasnt on the line i would send it right now but i want to play it safe until the exchange gets what they need and gets back to me . im sure you can understand .
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:10:27
Yeah its scary.
