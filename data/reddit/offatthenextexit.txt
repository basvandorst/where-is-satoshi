you posted this on reddit in a public forum, and you asked him a question.  if you dont want people from reddit's opinion, don't post on reddit.

Bryce's previous coin. One of about 20.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:05:59
lol no this guy is a joke
@_date: 2014-01-01 20:31:12
It's actually nothing like that because Bitcoin is not just a joke. But go ahead. Let's check back in one month and see where Doge is at then. Currently avg'ing 56 on cryptsy (all time low). It will be under 40 in a month.
@_date: 2014-01-05 00:06:53
Shame that only just balances out your doge losses LOL
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:40:33
Hasn't budged on Gox for weeks!
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:31:59
I don't believe I fall into this category. Personally, it was simply because I was unable to withdraw them. MtGox kept rejecting my ID validation since November. I initially used the exchange because I didn't trust Btc-e. I bet on the company with a public figure being less crooked than an anonymously owned website based in who-knows-where and I lost. I got into Crypto in October and used Gox then, tried to move in November when I realized it was not a good site to be on but was stuck there due to their ID denials = no withdrawals. It was not the entirety of my holdings, though, but a significant amount.
@_date: 2014-04-13 09:13:47
yeh but then he couldnt get karma on @_date: 2014-02-16 22:34:51
Conclusion: this story is fake.
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:24:19
Doge orders going through at all time low on cryptsy. lol.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:41:12
I was unable to use btcbldr due to Gox denying my verification continually since November. Unverified accounts have no internal transfers.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:49:03
i lost over 200 coins in gox and this made me laugh. i hate you. thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:19:33
Who knows. Same people that are buying Goxcoins. I'm just saying "delete their twitter" was inaccurate. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:34:30
I don't think he can run either. Because he's fat.
@_date: 2014-01-05 00:17:52
Bitcoin is an investment. Doge is a joke, that has ended, and it's going to go down.
ps. while you were replying it dropped from 37 to 34. lol
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:54:22
Those be some politician stats son
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:36:07
eh, 215. i'm screwed but i'm sure i'll laugh about it... in a year... or ten...
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:14:31
They didn't delete their twitter, they deleted their old tweets. Since most of them were "Dear Valued Victim" this could be a rebrand/push of new management. I wouldn't be surprised if Karpeles resigns and the site is taken on by new blood.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:46:45
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:47:59
I agree with this to the point where I've become financially irresponsible because I keep buying things with BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:03:24
500 of it was left, and sold. the dump down to 30 before rising back to 50 was insane earlier. this dump down to 17 was pretty insane to watch too
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:09:36
anybody can create a key for an email address though...
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:06:47
That you know of...
@_date: 2014-01-01 16:34:41
By far the highest (consistently) profit I make from mining an alt and trading for BTC in the following days by setting high sells on Cryptsy. WDC has high volume and gets pretty high in price, so if you mine WDC and set high but achievable sells you make a decent bit. If I'm not sure which alt to mine, I leave WDC running. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:33:09

Fast transactions? Fuck altcoins!
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:15:26
The doge joke is over dude. Price is plummeting. WDC has a great dev team, one of the best. PPC is also a strong choice. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:40:19
Yes, saw this coming too but Gox kept declining my verification (since November) so was unable to get these coin off the site. Regret ever sending them there!
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:35:36
Thanks for coming forward and putting a halt to the scam they were trying to pull. 
Are the current "bitcoin withdrawal" problems due to no funds being in the wallet and thus withdrawals only work after somebody else deposits? I know the suggested fix was "transfer to another currency and withdraw", surely this means at this point all of their coins are misbalanced now?
Was fyrstikken using the site's reserves to daytrade (eg. margin trade with other's balances) to try to recoup losses quicker?
Is the reason CryptoRush went down each time a new coin was added to MintPal because the site operators were using this arbitrage opportunity to sell their user's coins during the hype peak and then rebuy them lower once the hype was over, taking advantage of the bubble prices and screwing their customers out of that opportunity?

3rd degree: MtGox deleted their Twitter feed to rebrand and fund money into a new start up Magic The Gathering Exchange
4th degree: MtGox deleted their Twitter feed to rebrand and fund money into a new start up Magic The Gathering Exchange after discovering a bug in the Bitcoin protocol that the Bitcoin Foundation are covering up
5th degree: MtGox deleted their Twitter feed to rebrand and fund money into a new start up Magic The Gathering Exchange after discovering a bug in the Bitcoin protocol that the Bitcoin Foundation are covering up. Mark has been killed and replaced by an android replica, allowing inflitration of Gox by the Bitcoin Foundation.

@_date: 2014-03-07 04:18:50
he was involved in secret .gov projects. he probably thought it was about that
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:43:39
lol... so, karpeles documents the "bug" on his own site? but then discovered it today also?
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:13:23

I've seen it. A further nail in Doge's coffin. Another joke that will be profitable for 3 weeks and then die, when replaced by another joke.

@_date: 2014-02-24 08:05:59
This happened to me the other day. Got bored waiting after 50 hours so I imported my wallet into mycellium and double spent it, everything sorted itself out.

This could well be a genius workaround. Buy a voucher w/ fiat and then BTC China handles the actual 'currency conversion' internally when swapping vouchers for BTC.
BTC China might have put themselves back in the game.

Your comment was a prophecy, of sorts
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:49:20
No. Bitcoin doesn't aim to destroy. It aims to alter and improve. You're short-sighted if you think the financial industry will not exist even if Bitcoin becomes the global standard.

do you know the tormail address, and any 'general' idea what the username or password could be? eg: maybe it was something like 'TheBigDog14' but that doesn't work, just knowing what it could be like is useful.

well your initial post is misleading then, since it says this:
"do you want to cash out within the next 12 months?" ...
"no" ...
"you're not ready for bitcoin!"
if you answered "yes" to wanting to cash out within 12 months then that would suggest you aren't ready. but "no" means you are ready.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:43:20
lol. yes i know. and the coins were seized by the FBI when they took down the site and arrested ross.

bitcointalk is down, but check the link i posted when it's back live. a lot of people discussing same thing from the last 2-3 days

i don't see how you're missing this. i have over 600 bitcoins, i'm not investing anymore. i was simply pointing out that your initial post was worded wrong, as you suggested that if people answered "no" to "do you want to cash out within the next 12 months?" then they are not ready for bitcoin, but then contradicted yourself in the reply. what you meant to say was if someone answers "yes" to "do you want to cash out within the next 12 months?" then theyre not ready to invest

Yes, mine hasn't shown up either. I'm not too worried about them scamming, but I'm pissed off that I have missed out on buying the coins I wanted to. I also would like to cash out now, anticipating a drop within the next 12 hours, and they are preventing me from doing so.
