I’m one of them pal! When I first bought they cost me $7.11usd but I thought they were just fun internet monies then...no use crying over spilt milk man, I just needed you awesome people to tell me suck it up and keep riding the roller coaster, fingers crossed, all in!

I’m really not a very knowledgeable person compared to many other redditors, I’ve just been sort of winging it and a few years ago I thought it was fun internet monies, as for Monero because of its high privacy (ring signatures) I think it could be a good medium for people with $$ to secretly move their wealth around without drawing any attention, it’s paying off so far, fingers crossed! Jump on the monero subreddit and talk to the more informed crew!

I’ve worked like a madman the last 3 years and I’m in a financial position now where I can afford to do it and you know what your spot on, I just needed some words of support from my fellow roller coaster riders, Thankyou! I’m in

I know it’s a gamble, but I’ve bet on worse and every time I’ve questioned it I’ve ended up slapping myself for not buying at the time

Diversification is part of the plan, I bought XMR at $88 a few weeks ago....I love this crazy ride
