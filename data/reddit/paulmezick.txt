Oh, so now 6% a year is bad? I've got some news for you, nothing can be up 1000% year after year.
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:28:01
USD is never going to fully tank. If it all spirals out of control and the US domestic markets crash, so will international markets. So will precious bitcoin. People are not going to herd their money into a speculative digital currency. It isn't happening any time soon. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:38:38
This is bullshit. This is all high risk.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:48:11
I wonder how many kids read this pipe dream news article and instantly open Excel to see what their $100 investment will be worth when the price reaches $1 million.
LOL guys
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:37:54
Hey guy, I've never put a penny into this nonsense.
I hope you keep throwing every dollar you own into this bubble. I really hope you do.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:08:45
If it was that easy to chart penny stocks then everyone would be a millionaire. It can break support.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:59:51
I strike you as an idiot? Maybe I should have slapped /s at the end of my post earlier. Have you read 99% of the posts in this subreddit? This thing is littered with kids that threw a few hundred dollars at bitcoin anxiosly waiting for it to skyrocket. There are people that have no idea what they are doing and expect this to be a get rich quick scheme.
I fully understand that this thing has no logical direction. I wouldn't be surprised if it hits 30k and I wouldn't be surprised if it falls back down to 1k.
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:32:19
Yea, so that means its going to collapse!
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:21:26
1 million? What are you smoking? This thing is infinitely more likely to continue tanking. There is no way in hell it soars to $1 million. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:05:26
Come on. You are smart enough to know that the value of 1 bitcoin will not be worth $1 million USD. At least I hope you are.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:58:48
Oh so if the pricing behavior is purely cyclical if should be a piece of cake to make millions on this extremely risky vehicle. There is no guarantee that past performance drives future results.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:30:23
I see what you are saying. Yes, if your payment in bitcoin is from your net wages then yea, you would only pay a capital gains tax if you sold your bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:24:22
And this is exactly where everyone in this sub stops paying attention. I'm not sure why anyone believes exponential growth can continue on forever. I constantly see, "look what it was priced at 2 year ago!" as evidence that one year of historic returns should be used to forecast the coming years. Its as if everyone here claims to be an expert but clearly has no grasp on any of this.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:20:50
How is he ignorant? Whether or not you think this is the "start of a revolution", that doesn't directly correlate with bitcoin being up massively again. At some point this thing would need to become stable with little volatility if what you are saying is true. What is that price? Nobody knows. Maybe its up, maybe it down from where it is now. There is nothing wrong with him taking his profits and moving to a much safer investment.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:33:04
Yea I fired up Excel to calculate the pipe dream return on my 0 bitcoins!
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:09:58
what? this doesn't even make sense.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:16:17
Again, he could be right. His prediction has the same footing as "to the moon!". I see people constantly posting bullshit about btc hitting 100k. It's all bullshit, nobody knows anything.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:52:33
Totally, and then in a couple more it will pass $1 million! And then when it gets there just keep holding! Next stop $1 billion.
This place is like a sick misinformed cult.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:12:51
It still retains it's same domestic purchasing power. A dollar of milk does not inflate in price. Sure, imports become more expensive. At the end of the day my mortgage is X dollars a month. After inflation it's still X dollars per month.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:12:59
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:56:00
Such a senseless prediction. This thing has been headed downward for a couple of months now and has sank to just above 10k today. You really don't think its headed below there? Haha
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:47:41
This is pure speculation. I would not be surprised if a $1m home is worth less than $1m of bitcoin a few years now from now. I also would be equally unsurprised if bitcoin was worthless a few years from now. Your statement that bitcoin will *most likely* make you more in a few years than your home is not a factual statement. You could also conclude that bitcoin will *most likely* make you less in a few years than a house. Both statements are pure speculation.
The only thing you really know is that a house has intrinsic value. Homes have never been worth nothing.
At some point bitcoin will cease to double its value. Maybe its 10 years from now, maybe it next year, maybe it already happened.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:25:25
Absolute nonsense. Keep telling yourself this.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:17:30
You know you need to pay capital gains taxes on any profits you realized, correct?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:17:07
Yea but brah these are all cutting edge redditors that have discovered the world's greatest investment!
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:10:47
Or thats what he believes. Not everyone thinks BTC is going to the moon. Nothing really suggests that it surpasses the high it hit a couple of months back. I guess if you read this subreddit and buy into all the nonsense articles are posted then, sure, its going to hit 100k this year!
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:42:46
Exponential growth can't be sustained forever.at some point the market cap would be more than all of the money on earth. Would you agree that is not possible? It's not.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:00:29
Keep convincing yourselves of this...
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:19:38
Nobody knows the future but you sure as heck get upset any time anyone predicts this thing will drop. If nobody knows the future then how are you so certain this will climb?
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:25:10
No point. You didn't have that detail in your post so it read as if you sold your coins and were putting the cash all down for a house. I could easily see someone overlooking the tax detail.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:18:44
That doesn't mean it has barely budged. Crypto markets are extremely volatile. Day to day they boldly budge.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:55:08
Another "financial crisis" wouldn't make investors feel safe in a digital currency. Wall street is not going to flock to bitcoin. Despite what this subreddit would lead you to believe, investment managers are not allocating cash to bitcoin. It is not happening. Just like the guy you are responding to you already explained, if bitcoin were to somehow climb to $1 million, it would not have anywhere near the buying power of $1 million USD does today.
As long as people in the US continue to get paid in USD, they will largely use USD. Heck, the dollar is at something like a 3 year low right now and I have only heard whispers about it. People are getting by just fine and panic is not setting in. Certainly, if it were to set in, I wouldn't be throwing my life savings into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:01:58
Hopefully the year in your username is the year you were born. That would at least explain the stupid optimism that you exhibit with this nonsense.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:53:16
I never said it would go to zero. I said that it would not surprise me if it doubled in value or went to zero. Basically, I have no idea where it will go. Its all speculation. A house and the land it sits on will always have a positive value. I think its reckless to advise people that bitcoin will outperform the real estate market when thinking over the term of years. It's all speculation at this point. People may *hope* it outperforms real estate, but who really knows at this point?
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:26:14
I'm not sure what world you live in where 7% is "barely budged"
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:48:11
Yea it has totally rebounded! The sky is the limit! Guarentee this thing exponentially rises indefinitely! This isn't a bubble!
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:20:50
No experience with this but you would have to pay taxes on your gross wages. It doesn't matter what you are being paid in. USD, bitcoin, dildos, whatever - it would be taxed.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:45:36
Nah man. All I do is invest in the markets and try to match what the market is doing. I will be able to quit my job one day, thanks.
The only one waiting for a sure thing with astronomical returns is you.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:55:15
Yea, I wouldn't put a penny into bitcoin that my family's future depended on. Your retirement should not be tied up a highly speculative currency.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:30:08
Yea bros, this guy clearly understand that he can daytrade cryptos and never work a day in his life and hang out with Bill Gates.
Get a job buddy.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:19:06
Yea, never going to happen. Don't quit your day job.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:24:05
But this thinking is such a risky way of thinking. Do you honestly think Bitcoin is going to become a global currency that is adopted by developed nations? Why would anyone believe this at this point?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:58:11
Maybe he's right
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:26:56
With your logic, maybe it was manipulated up to it's all time high as well.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:06:48
How is bitcoin a safe haven at this point? In 1 year a dollar is still a dollar. It still has the same relative purchasing power. Meanwhile nobody knows what a Bitcoin will be worth. That's the last place I want money that I will need.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:56:03
Yea let's ban him because hes not talking up up Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:51:07
They aren't sure but they certainly latch on to anything that they can spin as positive. You have to realize that many people saying Bitcoin can only go up and it's the future are probably 18 year old kids that threw $100 at btc. Meanwhile they're probably sitting there with Excel open calculating their millions once the price keeps exponentially rising.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:44:32
Reckless strategy. Nothing supports btc climbing to the moon.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:22:52
Lol I was so confused
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:48:52
Come to grips man. Its not going to climb back up to 20k anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:00:14
Oh yea? It ALWAYS has? Then why is it back at its Nov 30th level? I thought it ALWAYS climbs back up?
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:20:20
Just like the bubbled bitcoin market, right?
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:50:29
LOL more blind nonsense
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:31:52
"fuck speculators"
Anyone that puts a penny into this thing is speculating.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:10:16
Because this subreddit is filled with kids in denial that think this was a ticket to an exponentially growing investment. Everyone sweeps aside any hint that the run up to 20k was pure hysteria like you said.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:26:39
Sure, inflation means I should flock to Bitcoin! Does anyone here have idea what they are talking about? We won't see hyper inflation. Price increases will be manageable and certainly low enough that the liquidity and ease of use is a much safer bet than putting it all into an illiquid 10%+ daily swing speculative digital currency.
Some goods will increase in price. The bulk of my spending (mortgage) will not.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:44:36
For real? You also think there is a real chance BTC rises to $1 million? HAHAHAHAHAHA
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:53:01
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:14:23
You are so dense. You have this warped sense of an easy way into the high life. You aren't going to become a millionaire with this currency. It's not going to continue to exponentially grow as time goes on. It is not possible. Get that though your head and you will be better off.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:33:07
I'd much rather be issued a currency that is backed by our government. Right now, USD is backed by the US government and is FDIC insured. If the government transitioned to their own digital currency or shockingly got behind bitcoin, I think most people would be fine with it. There is nothing wrong with wanting your government behind your currency.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:19:21
You can apply that same logic to everything before it tanks for good. It would have applied to Enron as well before that went to 0. Good job!
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:22:46
So you'd throw your money at a bubble? The USD isn't going to collapse and disappear. The US as a country will remain a super power. This is stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:41:19
LOL okay change the world?
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:19:53
I can easily imagine a world where bitcoin specificly doesn't exist. I go through each day interacting with people and there is never a single mention of bitcoin. There is a serious delusion in here that bitcoin is becoming a widely used currency.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:59:11
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:48:47
Get a grip man. An index of the domestic economy is not as volatile as crypto's. Nobody is losing their shit over the DOW being down 1% on the day.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:16:19
Sure, but that doesn't mean Bitcoin is going to become the global standard of crypto if one is eventually to stand toe to toe with today's currencies. It's foolish to just assume this is the next Google. It could actually have little to no value in a year. That card is not off the table.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:27:00
Ding ding ding. Someone that actually understands!
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:44:27
You could realistically sell if you still had a profit or you were simply looking to limit your losses because you think this is going even lower. Sure, you don't realize the losses unless you sell, but there is no guarantee this thing goes back up to whatever value it is that you purchased at.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:06:44
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:29:47
It does in the sense that if I hand you $100 cash you can easily exchange it for physical goods. Everyone will accept it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:46:01
I'm a bit confused. Crypto is down more than stocks are on the day. I suppose you can look at things and put any spin you want on them.
Additionally stocks were also down when crypto was majorly down on the day.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:32:02
Yea, everyone in the country getting a refund is going to rush to throw it into bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:24:08
Nah brah, major support!
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:30:10
Here is some more delusional bullshit from this subreddit. Banks are going to die now huh? The average age in here HAS to be 15. There is no other explanation for this crap.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:45:20
Or it could just be that this thing is massively overvalued
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:39:55
Because this bullshit chart makes sense and everything right? Growth will just continue on at an unprecedented pace and everyone on this subreddit will become a millionaire. Nobody will have to work!&gt;1111!
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:08:58
Nothing, he's just delirious. Nothing about this can ensure anyone that this will hit 20k+ or 1k.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:40:48
No, my investments are balanced in the broad market. My cash is in USD.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:13:10
You know it recovers? Lol...
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:05:15
Good for you, no reason this won't continue dropping.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:10:14
Can't tell if you are trolling. There is no guarantee it bounces back to its ATH levels or even half of that.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:39:29
Oh really? Tell me more nonsense please.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:30:23
What? How does any of this have anything to do with the average person paying off their debts? If you have student loan debt you should be paying that with extra cash instead of putting it into any cypto or stock.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:18:48
Fuck you are annoying
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:49:30
Kids that stole a $20 from Mom's purse thought that, by throwing it into Bitcoin, they would continue to see exponential returns and one day would be burried knee deep in pussy. So basically they would be able to afford Lamborghinis.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:06:19
What happened to the experts in this sub calling for the market crash today?
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:56:00
Enlighten us, how does it work then? This guy hit the nail on the head. You don't know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:33:48
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:04:37
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:51:29
Absolute nonsense. This gets a big fat LOL
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:23:34
And what about back on January 17th when it dropped to 9k only to bounce back up to just under 13k by the 20th? That certainly looked like strong support. Look where it is now. There is no telling if this is it at this point. I would be surprised if this doesn't continue to fall in the coming days.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:50:09
I think its pretty hilarious how you didn't post yesterday. And if you don't think bitcoin can fall just as fast as it rises you are an idiot. Look at the downtrend since early January. This isn't the first time it has jumped back up this much only to continue its downward trend later.
Please tell me about what date you think it will be $50k? I want to save that one for later.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:29:43
Um are you new to all of this? Compare pretty much anything today and you will see the same trend.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:26:20
Right but you are removing valuable context. Sure, if it rises steadily to 6k people would have been happy but this guy exploded to 20k and has been getting slaughtered since then. 6k isn't even looking stable. The floor has dropped out.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:11:22
Or maybe just a pack of gum
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:27:39
Found the big 20 year old!
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:46:18
Here you go again! This claim is much more plausible than this thing hitting $100k at this point. I'm not sure you have any idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:27:16
So, your conclusion is that it's going to continue to increase at this pace? It's not possible. It can't continue to exponentially grow. Like I said, at some point it needs to either stabilize or it will fizzle out and people will lose. Keep smoking the corruption pipe. Bitcoin is not a safety net. If the world economy collapsed people would not put what's left into a digital currency. 
You honestly believe the multiple of 10 continues? 1...10...100....1,000...10,000....
100,000... 1,000,000... 10,000,000.. 100,000,000...
You see how unrealistic this is right? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:54:40
Very early adoption but, without government backed currencies somehow becoming untrusted, Bitcoin will remain at a very low adoption rate.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:39:10
So that means history will repeat itself indefinitely!
*past performance is not indicative of future results*
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:17:10
I know this is hard to believe, but some people have no intention in ever throwing money at any of these speculative gambles. Thats great, I'm glad you are enjoying the small amount of money you made on bitcoin. Have fun!
I'm sorry you get emotionally stressed out when someone has an altering viewpoint. There is nothing wrong with thinking this entire concept is still overvalued currently.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:54:23
Massive amounts of denial in here today
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:14:42
If this isn't a crash then I don't know what is. Trust me, plenty of people are selling. Why else would the price be in freefall for days now? -10%+ per day has become the norm.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:11:14
Where was he offering advice in this post? He's just posting what is going on currently.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:43:27
USD also doesn't have the potential to suddenly be worth 20x less tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:54:40
Where are all the people who recently claimed this couldn't fall below 10k?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:08:13
Hahaha no
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:11:59
Moon, $1 million, lambos, have fun kid.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:49:53
And what backs that? That is an extremely ballsy prediction.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:48:31
It doesn't have to go back up to its ATH level. This is more nonsense. Anyone who buys assuming its definitely going back up to 20k is foolish.
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:47:53
ITS GOING TO CHANGE THE FINANCIAL WORLD? LOL
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:53:06
Yea, a highly volatile speculative currency with no government behind it is much safer than our conventional system. How did I not realize this sooner!? You are right, bitcoin will be the future and will SAVE the world! I should mortgage my house and invest today. Fuck, I'd rather my company pay me in digital currency with daily 10% fluctuations. Hell, who cares if my money loses 50% of its value in a month. If I just HODL I will be set for life!
When WWIII breaks out and domestic/international markets plummet to pre-depression levels I will just be living the high life with my bitcoin as all the peons flock to it!!!
Am I doing this right? Do you really think you have a life-time endless money supply by buying bitcoin low and selling high? This exact scenario plays out constantly with worthless penny stocks. Eventually the speculative company fails to ever go back up in value. People lose a lot of money with highly speculative investments. It is not impossible for that to happen here. Keep spewing your bullshit though.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:50:02
Really? I think what you are seeing is all the people who were gloating about the moon and lambos have disappeared recently. Any time anyone makes 1 negative comment towards bitcoin they get downvoted into oblivion.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:18:53
It is not crashing hard. That is an overstatement
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:37:10
Sorry, lets post the exponential growth charts instead! That will convince more suckers to buy buy buy! Moon! Lambos! 100k in a year!
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:25:50
It's a lot closer to 5k than it is the moon. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:40:32
Hahahaha you are a fool
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:38:14
Wow, more uneducated bullshit. Its the only thing you post.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:32:58
Mortgage the house and BUY!
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:55:11
I wouldn't be surprised at all if it heads down to sub 6k in the next few weeks. It certainly isn't going to exponentially grow for eternity. The 12 year olds in here need to understand that.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:47:16
Yea but you can't guarantee gains. Plus student loan interest is likely 6%+. You should be paying off the loans for a guaranteed return that is your interest rate.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:09:03
Right, but the MAJOR issue with cryptocurrencies is that they will not be widely used unless they are stable and unless the government gets behind them. Why would anyone want to be paid in a volatile currency that is not backed by their government? That is nuts. I would never want to be paid in bitcoin or another crypto when my day to day life is largely influenced by USD.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:07:14
No I really wouldn't. I understand that people made good money on this. I also understand that hype drove the price up at an alarming rate and it resulted in it being very overvalued. It won't keep repeating this cycle over and over. It will either need to become stable if it is to achieve what the technology was set out to do or it will eventually crash one last time and become abandoned. Someone at some point will get burned.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:01:41
Sorry, Google and Amazon don't gain and lose 5-20% per day. Bitcoin behaves like a penny stocks currently. Money will not flow into this if the stock market has a down year. People will go to gold and silver before a highly volatile vehicle.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:47:08
And why doesn't the same logic apply to the 1 month of exponential growth? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:23:45
Yea you should all mortgage the house and buy back in
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:47:11
Yea I'm such a fool for having my emergency fund in USD! I should constantly be fx trading every dollar that I own!
You clearly have no understanding of sane investments. Keep chasing your unattainable easy life through crypto gambling.

Yea maybe today I can. But what about tomorrow? Maybe tomorrow I can sell it for 12k USD or 7k USD. In that sense it is a horrible store of value. Why would anyone agree to accept this as a form of payment in its current state? It won't become anything more than it is currently, an investment, unless it stabilizes. And if it were to stabilize, maybe most of the current investors move on to something with high volatility again in an attempt to make money as opposed to storing value. If that were to happen, doesn't the value decrease and it once again becomes a volatile currency? Basically, unless government backed currencies cease to exist, why would the general people fully back these currencies? Unless people start getting paid in these currencies, I don't see how they will succeed. What I can see happening is a government moving on to their own crypto currency one day.

Neither do you. You just disregard anything negative and expect Bitcoin to hit 100k sometime soon. Everything you post shows that you understand nothing.

No it's really not surprising. Remember when it went up exponentially for a month? There was no good reason for that either.

Does bitcoin specifically seem likely to you, or is it the idea of cyrpto currency? I can see crypto being adopted at some point, but I don't think bitcoin specifically has a chance.

I feel like you left put the point of my text. Investors don't move into volatile holdings when there is unease in the market. Why would any new money flow into btc at a time like this? Confidence in btc is lower than it normally is, and it is normally pretty low as displayed by it's day to day volatility.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:05:27
Nobody has a real answer for any of these questions.

@_date: 2018-02-04 16:20:11
And if it is the future why does it need to climb to 100k, or 1million? The people assuming that this will, without a doubt, pick up it's exponential growth again are setting themselves up to lose.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:35:40
Crypto is highly volatile. I would expect it to act like an amplified version of the broader market. If there is a large downward movement in the world I would expect btc to be even more down and also the inverse. I'm not sure why some people here thought investors would move to cypto in a down market. Volatile vehicles will be avoided at times like this.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:23:40
Strong support at 15k, strong support at 12k, strong support at 10k.. 9k.. 8k..
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:48:40
Sorry man, the stock exchange hasn't been losing 10% day over day. As rough of a week that the market has had it is still a much safer and less volatile bet than crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:42:45
Of course he doesn't His post history is just filled with nonsense. Hes either 12 years old or just really dumb.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:55:39
The stock market is an entire index of companies. It is basically the global economy. If we really want to compare Bitcoin to the stock market we should be comparing it to a single company. A single company can lose value and never recover. The global economy really can't do this unless we somehow stopped being productive and growing.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:00:07
Because everyone here acts like they have severe dementia. There are intense reactions to the day to to day movement of bitcoin. It is more than enough proof that this thing is nowhere near ready enough to be used as a currency.

We really aren't. I see no signs that the world is on the brink of switching over to digital currencies. That would involve people getting paid in the digital currencies. This will not happen as long as the volatility remains high. You would be a fool to elect to be paid in such a volatile way.
My average day typically concludes with not a single person speaking of digital currencies.

Totally just basic understanding of graphs and charts
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:36:16
Sure, it's wildely volatile, but over a larger picture it could remain at a relatively flat price. I'm not saying money can't be made on tbe day to day swings. Good for you and whoever else that has been successful at doing that. And lol at those that think everyone should be helplessly holding for the long run.

I like how everyone just assumes there is going to be a breakout and the thought of a stagnant price not being a possibility. It seems like a large group of this subreddit expects that the price should and will be rising by thousands per month. I'm convinced that most people here know very little about how any of this works and likely bought in months ago while the price was higher.
How many times has it been now during this drawn out downward spiral where, we see a brief upswing, and everyone comes out of hiding saying "we've hit bottom! 6900 has major support!!!11!. If it breaks through though, it will hit even large support at 6400. If it breaks through 7k then it will continue up until 11k." ? People are really pulling this all out of their ass.
