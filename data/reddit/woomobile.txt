I mine about the same way as you, and I use MtRed.
But like ihh said, it doesn't really matter which pool you use, you're gonna get the same amount.

For number 5, mining gets harder the more total miners there are, that might have been what you meant.

[Mtred]( shows the value of each found block with the fees.

I just got 1 BTC from this place to check it out, they transferred it 20 minutes after I ordered.

I don't really know that much either, but I'll try to answer your questions.
The only thing that's produced is more bitcoins, and the ones benefiting are the people mining. It's done by decrypting "blocks." The person who decrypts the block gets, as of right now, 50 bitcoins.
Yep, people just agree they have value. The same way we just agree that gold, silver, and currencies have value. The thing keeping hackers from making themselves billions is the decryption. All of the mining makes sure all the new blocks are valid. Since the program is open source, anyone can look into the code and make sure that it's not shady.

I've been looking for a way to do this too. The place stuhood posted is down, but [this one]( is pretty much the same thing, and is up. If the Mt Gox high doesn't go up for an hour, it'll be cheaper to buy then.

Oh, is that why the block values are always slightly higher than 50?
