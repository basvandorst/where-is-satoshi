coinbase can be accessed via your login info, so it isn't exactly the same as having them on your pc where you can't really log in without being ON the PC.
Everyone is saying get a linux install on an offline computer and generate your wallet there.  remember, the only thing that matters is the public/private keypair.  The blockchain will acknowledge that you xferred your coins to an address, even if you generated that address offline.  That is why the bitcoin eater address can exist, no one has a key to it, but it is a valid address.  
If you lose your hdd your coins are gone unless you back up your private key somewhere.

Also add more people being born make jobs more scarce, since less than 1% of the population starts businesses.  Thus too many people, not enough jobs (decrease wages due to competition) and too few houses (increased price).

breadwallet isn't an exchange?
Cant you just create a new breadwallet wallet and write the seed phrase down on paper and store it somewhere safe (preferably in 2 locations). Transfer the funds to your breadwallet. Then use the breadwallet "reset wallet" feature to wipe the seed from the iphone. (Don't just delete the breadwallet app as the seed phrase will still reside in the keychain - this is something that needs to be made clearer for breadwallet users). Now you have a very simple cold storage solution.

While I understand what you're saying, in order for btc to hit 1MM, it *has* to survive a long time first.  So if it didn't survive, the chance of it hitting 1MM would be 0%.  
Therefore, they're related probabilities and not wholly disparate.

How are you remotely right?
@_date: 2011-06-19 16:31:56
Kinda.  Right now difficulties are increasing, meaning more hashing power than predicted, meaning less than 140 years at current expansion rates (which may or may not be sustainable).
Faster GPUS, ASICs, etc will only serve to push the 140 number much closer to 'today'.
Instead of 14 day windows, we're getting 9-10 day windows.  So maybe only 100 years :p
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:17:28
Show me that your only job, only compensation is those 2 open source projects and I'll concede that you are correct.
Or, admit that you are paid to work on myriad projects, and contributing occasionally to some open source ones does happen, but is not even 51% of why you are being paid, and you concede that you were exaggerating.

Would you trust the app? It would basically have your exchange info and thus banking info.
Unless it were open source, I doubt people would trust it. If it were open source, it would need to be maintained for free every time an exchange opened or updated or closed, for free.
If the user is "noob" they'll blame the app and developer if anything goes wrong, at any time, even unrelated to bitcoin.
Not going to find anyone willing to take that on. :(

The reality is a longer password is more secure in every situation imaginable, based on the fact that a hacker cannot know the heuristic you applied to generate your password. 
Your heuristic will be the same.  Making the password longer, based on a given heuristic, makes it more secure.  Padding a simple password makes it harder to brute force.  Padding a complex password makes it harder to brute force.
End of story.  This is mathematically provable and incontrovertible.

So, if we assume there are around 1M users now, out of 7 billion, that is 1.42e-7.  Or .01%.  To get to 15-18% of the world would require 1.5B people.  
That is a growth of 1,500x more people than are currently using it.  You think that will happen? Or that it is really required to happen to make an acceptance of the technology?
edit: 7 billion people, not trillion.  Also edited math.

Because it isn't earmarked for any particular usage.  It doesn't pay for internet. It doesn't pay for a mortgage. It doesn't go toward any loans. It won't be used to pay any utility bills.

From $240-$500 there are 15,000 coins available.
The queue for verification in mtgox is 15000 or so right now.  
If every one of those people buys 1 coin, the price easily gets to $500.  What are the odds that those people will only buy 1 coin?

That is possible.  Also if they went with mysql and chose myisam instead of innodb.   Ultimately mtgox is built upon the old magic the gathering online exchange engine, so .. who know what kind of spaghetti code they have.
They posted that they're working on a solution, but that they require much more testing before they can roll it out.

This is one of the first 3-4 day weekends (depending on point of view) since the huge runup in Jan/Feb/Mar.  So this might be standard for all long holidays.

It depends on the attack.
If the attack is a dictionary attack, then you will be more quickly undone than if you changed 1 letter to a zero.
The problem is that a hacker doesn't know what you have picked so they can't just waste their time hoping you only used dictionary words.  That means they do a full-character attack.

Pretty amazing.   You just found a way to pay for your college education. 
Cash out 1-5 using coinbase.  That'll give you some return on your coins, spend on gyft or something today (it's black friday, lots of discounts).  Buy a new LED HDTV and a XBOne or PS4, and some games. 
Maybe buy a car, if you are in a more rural area.   They're a couple grand and will run 5-6 years for one 5-6 years old.

And 21 dots is 'obvious'?  There really isn't any good / obvious padding if the password is long enough.

Good points. 
Especially the $0.05 -&gt; $160.00 ratio.  3,200x increase.  (which is more like 320,000%).
Mt Gox opened in July of 2010.  BTC's were ~0.05 and 0.08.
It turns out that within 7 months of then (Feb 2011) BTC were at parity with the USD.    Still, no one really knew about it.   Since Feb 2011, over 2 years ago, the price has only gone up 160x.  
Will it still be capable of going up 1600%?  Yes.  I think it will.  160*1600% = $2,560.  it is going to take 1-2 years but I think this will happen.  
I would argue, then, that right now a 1600% growth is still easily achievable, and that now is a great time to invest.

Considering how few people are actually executing trades in mtgox, it shouldn't take very much hardware or software on the database end. 
Microsoft SQL on a decent Dell server with replication to web-facing read-only databases is a few 10s of thousands.  Get a decent backup solution in place for under 100k for sure. 
Writing non-row-locking code that is multithreaded is much more possible these days than ever.  Problem is probably getting the expertise, but maybe pay a few developers 100k/yr and a few sql admins similarly and maybe a system administrator or 2.  Probably get it all done for what Mt.Gox makes in 1 month.

Looks like 3 lines, and that code skips all the rest of the possible pad characters.  You could have used a regular expression to capture a large character set.  That doesn't even remotely make your code efficient in implementation, however.  Even guessing that there are 21 characters, and that some are padded, you'll be running that brute force attack for decades if not longer.
Longer is still more secure, and you have no idea that 21 is the length, if it is 22, your code fails.
My comment stands.  Unless you already know what you're cracking, you can't just arbitrarily code an algorithm to brute force it.  That is the whole point of large number factoring crypto.
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:37:15
You are just being silly now.  
You know you're in the wrong, and you know that a longer password will take longer to brute force.  Even with 'padding characters'.

@_date: 2013-04-14 22:15:45
Complexity only matters if you know the password and length.   As you say, all special characters are equally likely when you *don't* know the password and length.
Thus, you have to assume it is complex and start at 0 and go to infinity.  In such a scenario, the longer password is the more complex password.
If that didn't work, mathematically, then bitcoin wouldn't work.  It is based on large number factoring.  The numbers are large, so the computers can't easily solve them and print out your private key.  Bigger is better for crypto.

The only way to crack passwords is to brute force them based on some schema.  Be it a rainbow table, or a deterministic generator. Longer passwords of the same complexity simply take longer to crack, it is a mathematical certainty.

Well, you, the hacker, would have to run 4 and exactly 4 dictionary words together, but I think you're missing the order of the words.  Combination is not permutation.  So the odds that you'll sit there and run 1 dictionary word, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5 ... when do you stop?  What if there is a single period between 2 of the words?  I just don't see why a hacker would assume you are using only a dictionary word (or 4) and not any odd characters.

He makes accusations without supporting them, and then decides that because an ancient publication made a claim, it explains all trends thereafter. 
Even his opening line accuses anyone who has a bitcoin holding of being fallacious in any argument supporting them, without citing specific examples.
He then tries to relate bitcoins to numerous commodities, failing to recognize a number of things that bitcoins bring to the table that they do not.  
He accuses the blockchain of fully exposing the identity of every user, and numerous other fallacies.

Oh my!
So between now (0.5M ppl is the estimated userbase) and 4 years from now, 499.5M more people will be on board. 
4 years from now is 1460 days.  That is a growth rate of 1000x in 1460 days, so if it was linear, it would require only 0.342M new people, per day.  
Are we seeing an adoption rate of 342,000 people per day?  Even if the adoption rate is slightly curved, we'd still need close to 500,000 people per day toward the end of the timeframe.
MtGox/Coinbase can't even verify 100 people per day.  
Do you still feel it is realistic?

My whole premise isn't that complex passwords have less entropy.   That is a straw man argument you've constructed as my premise to fallaciously debate with me.
My premise is that longer passwords are more secure because hackers don't know what your password is, be it short, or long, and their hacking algorithms go from 1-n using every character.  Adding another character adds more security. 
Plain and simple.

Once I get my tax return, I'm dumping that all into bitcoins, if that gives you any idea of how I feel about them.
I also mined up some in 2011, but when the $30 crash hit, I stopped mining and just ignored my wallet.  
Lo and behold I started following btc again in Jan when there was new hype, and was afraid to buy in at $15, then afraid at $30, then afraid at $50, then afraid at $75. 
Now I am going to just dump my play money (tax return) all into btc and hope for the best.

Coinlab being pushed out a few weeks just makes the current pricing even less likely to be the top.

Set up 2 accounts, sell/buy to yourself.  You lose 0.6% (0.006 cents/dollar) which isnt much, considering that you're easily manipulating the market by simply moving 0.01 bitcoins around.
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:01:47
For it to do so, 1 btc would have to have fairly constant, and very high, value.  
There are only 21M coins that will ever exist.  Only half of them exist currently.  In order to make a thriving ecosystem, 10.5M btc has to be the equivalent of the currency in whatever 'ecosystem' you want it to emulate.
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:28:03
Well, other than the fact that the Jg(etc) number is 51 characters, and a private key is 51 characters, there isn't much to go off of to deconvert it to a legitimate private key from the encoded version.

10,000 x 1,000,000 = 10,000,000,000  (10B)
divided by 21,000,000 bitcoins = $476.19 per bitcoin.
So even with 1M participants at $10k each, we're still undervalued by about half.

Why not just buy BTC for any major purchases and use them within a few minutes?  Then the value will be (should be) relatively constant, and the BTC's keep getting shuffled around?
The more stores there are, and the easier it is to swap fiat for BTC, the more frequently this could happen, and it doesn't end up costing the purchaser anything.

Let's find an inflation calculator:
This one looks good.  
Popped in $100 from 1933 to 2012.   Here is the result:




they would cost you $100.00 and $6.15 respectively.

It does indeed favor the seller.  Like the sellers who sell 'solid state drives' that are really just thumb drives in a fake housing.  
Scammers benefit heavily from bitcoins, and the solution is an escrow, where the buyer *still* has the option to charge back if dissatisfied.  Bitcoins don't necessarily mean an end to friendly fraud, particularly because the one-way nature of the transactions will make general uptake and use without escrow, less likely.
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:42:00

It is a losing strategy until you realize that the ultimate goal is to buy in at the $125 mark or $115 mark with your 3rd account, and then you sell btc back to youreslf with your bots at 0.01 and 0.02 and ta-da, you then can sell the big 100 or 500 btc you bought back.
Step one: Sell 500 btc at $140.
Step two: run bots to get price to $115
Step three: buy back in with your $60000 and get 500btc + residual cash.
Step 4: run bots to put price back up.
Not only is it a winning strategy, this is a strategy that happens every week for the past 4 weeks.

@_date: 2013-04-03 19:08:43
If there aren't many asks between say 125 and 140, you program 2 bots with 2 accounts on mtgox to sell 0.1 bitcoin to yourself at 140, then 139.99 then 139.98, then 139.97 then 139.96 etc.
You'll trigger panic sellers, and other bots who are programmed to respond to price fluctuations and then you buy in at the bottom.
There are very obviously 0.02 bitcoin price manipulations and 0.01 manipulations.

1) MtGox was bringing in around $500,000 / mo.
2) Their code was originally for a magic the gathering trading card exchange platform. It is not well designed at all.
3) Yes, more people = more $. But to have more people you need to evoke trust.  DDOS'able exchanges != trust 
4) The next big exchange is coinlab.  It is due in the USA here in the next month or so. When it hits, bitcoins will take off bigtime.

You think it is straight forward to bring down amazon, microsoft or google?  It really isn't. MtGox can't afford that level of sophistication, but they can certainly rise above what they have now (which, by the way, they are doing a few things, but not everything).

If you actually went to college you'd realize how wrong you were.  Relying on other's flawed arguments doesn't help you.
Length matters in reality.  You can be as pedantic as you want.  The reality is, no algorithm is in use for cracking passwords that will solve an arbitrarily long string of one letter before a 3 letter password.  
You're blatantly spreading falsehoods and you should reevaluate your life.

What's funny to me is that 3 btc is nearly $3000, which is about 1.5 months of take-home income for an average American household (an entire family).

What if it incorporated several factors? # of tickets (clearly), and some other values, with a known algorithm, so people could show that with x, y, and z inputs, the output is the same, but x, y, and z can't be known until runtime.
if you did this, you'd have to not publish # of tickets sold until run-time, or people might try to game the system by knowing the algorithm and guessing at the other 2 (or more) other variables.  As long as there were enough components to run the algorithm it would be really hard to game the system.

No they're not.  Coinlab is opening in the US, mtgox is staying in japan.  Coinlab will be a US based wrapper for mtgox.  Mtgox will still exist, but no longer process US $. 
You have no idea what you're talking about
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:56:43
Yeah I am not going to spend any time on this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:02:06
Your understanding is slightly flawed.
The problem is that mtgox can be DDOS'd because its website is tightly coupled to the trading platform.  That would be like if gmail and google.com were on one webserver.  Take out one, you get the other.
MtGox is just not properly engineered and implemented. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:25:32
DDOSing bitcoinity doesn't do shit for the people who are trading on mtgox.  They don't even use bitcoinity, they use the built-in mtgox tools like the orderbook and HUD.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:57:54
It looks like a bot, then, probably a poorly coded one.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:56:48
Really? This week? Wow!  How unusual for them to post about things being just 1 week away!
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:09:28
It would typically require a number of addresses on the blockchain to show user base.
The problem might be that a few users don't have their own addresses depending on how mtgox or coinbase work.   
Overall, we don't have 2M addresses, so it is unlikely we have 2M users.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:39:44
Be that as it may, a decision to 'not invest because something might be innovated' is fairly weak.

Looking at the order depth on clark moody for mtgox,  I see that there are 15,000 btc between $240 and $500.
The queue to get authorized with mtgox is 15,500 people. 
Assuming each of those people want to buy only 1 btc, and that everyone who has coins decides to hold them, the price will be $500 by the time the queue has processed those current 15,500 people.
Of course, the queue gets longer every day.  Every day more coins are mined, and every day people do decide to sell and not hold some of their coins.  In addition people are buying much more than a single btc on mtgox.  I think those factors therefore, are all a 'wash'.  
To me, the current value of bitcoins, today, based only on the queue and the selling depth of the mtgox order book is easily $500/btc.

There really aren't that many transactions.  A standard SQL database would be able to handle everything mtgox has. 
Sure if there were tens of millions of users, a la facebook, a nosql design would be better. However, there aren't.  They can't even add 5000 people in a timely fashion, so we know the userbase is small.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:52:10

Make a mtgox account, xfer your coins in, and put up a sell offer at $10,000 then : )
There are already 176 bitcoins available at $10,000, so others agree with you.

Higher resolution isn't just for video.  It is screen real estate.  It is used for *everything*.  Understand?

Getting fiat into bitfloor is instantaneous and anonymous, through a Bank of America deposit into localtill.  I literally had my deposit there in less than 15 minutes from dropping cash off at the bank of america branch near me.
I think more people need to arbitrage the bitfloor (ez cash in) and mtgox (high btc volume) so there isn't an obvious $10-12 spread between bitfloor and every other exchange. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 19:37:23
Hmm. Are there any other parallels like this in the digital era?
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:29:29
ok so 15-18% of 2% of 7 Trillion ends up being: 21B people.  
We're currently at ~1M people, so we need 21,000 x more people using bitcoins. 
What would you estimate that will take, in terms of time?
Edit -- It is 7 billion not 7 trillion (see below).  So only 21x more people using bitcoins to hit 15-18%.  
Seems like the singularity is close.

Well, like I said, tax return is money I never really had anyway, and 2013 is still definitely early adopter.
Once coinlab goes live, that will be less of an early-adopter.  I consider btc still in the pre-ipo phase, coinlab I see as the IPO, and thereafter it will either sink or swim.

@_date: 2013-04-05 00:51:23
1) I was speaking about the items other people would want to auction, regarding bitcoins ; )
2) The address + your number isn't a lot of incentive : / we don't even know if you actually even own the condo (not saying you don't, just you should feel that you need to prove it).
3) You can create a provably fair method without knowing the result ahead of time, and it doesn't need to be based on # of tickets until the actual execution of the algorithm.  If you knew the outcome ahead of time, that would definitely not be provably fair.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:13:22

How is this "system" less rewarding than the current monetary policies of major nations? In the USA 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth, and with QE it only gets worse.

While I think that would be *awesome* I just don't see the fiat currency of any particular region being replaced by bitcoin.  I can see bitcoin having an exchange value against every currency, gold, silver, etc.  Just like a share of Google or Apple stock.  You don't go buy groceries with Apple stock, you have to use the local currency~

Ah but it is, see my post above with the 4 step process of obvious ease.
You're thinking small.  Need to think like you have 10,000 btc, not 5 btc.

A calc is a calc.  It just adds the yearly portion and then multiplies the existing amount by the % growth.  Repeat. 
Regardless, even a 401k has a cap of 18,500.  At a rate of 8% growth (unlikely) over 21 years, that results in $1.35M.  Not 3M. 
That tells me unless  you are investing closer to 40,000 per year, which I believe is impossible, and achieving an 8%+ rate of return (again nearly impossible, especially given the 2008 crisis) then there is no magical $3M retirement fund.

Ah, solid hedge betting right there

You should give RES a try on Chrome. It is amazing how much nicer Reddit gets when all I see is:

Or you can keep replying, either way I am amused.

Yes, all transactions are stored on the blockchain, no matter what you do with your wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:04:33
What is your rate of return? How much are you investing in this TSP per year?
Even a simple algorithm, found here: 
Shows that starting at 18, going to 39, and adding 5000/yr with a 10% rate of return only gets you $352,000 at retirement....

When shipping wine and beer the ID check stage happens at delivery.
It is only a matter of time before an alcohol retailer accepts btc for shipping alcohol, as usps and fedex deliver alcohol.

It is pretty volatile, I don't know that I'd use it for savings.
I would only put in money I'd be sad, but comfortable, losing completely.
Kind of like a trip to vegas with $x.  You know you're going to spread it out over the weekend, but if you leave with $0, you had a great time.

Well the story said that porsche was clearly a holder of 20%, then 30%, then they announced they were trying to get 75% and stood to gain all this money from that, but they couldn't get there because the bankers pulled the rug out from under them and called in their loans.
To me the moral of the story is: don't trust bankers.

That 2x 5k coin sale really put downward pressure on the market.  Someone cashing out ~$880,000.
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:34:09
And what do you do with that 2k? You need it to pay bills? 
I don't.  
Therefore, it is play money.  I could buy a PC.  I could take a trip.  I get to play with it.  Thus: play money.   Just because you don't understand that it isn't money that is already allocated, doesn't mean I am not able to do anything I like with it, including calling it play money.  I get to play, using it.  Experience life.  You should get out and experience life too.
@_date: 2013-03-06 01:36:37
No, you are attacking me for my opinions which is both puerile and pedantic, not that you know what those words even mean. 
Calling me names as if to bait me into paying cash for bitcoins is laughable, and something only a base intellect would undertake.  
I am not at all offended by your ridiculous characterizations, instead I pity you and people who ever have to be around you. 
Fortunately, I don't have to be around you, as RES has ignore.  If that was not clear: you're ignored. Permanently.

Sure ASIC is a real technology.  Is BFL a legit company providing legit hardware?  Not so far.  I read the "proof" from Avalon, and the blog post, I am still not confident in their claims. Now there are more "asic" companies popping up out of the woodwork.
I have yet to see any verifiable proof, anywhere, and people should not have to wade through obvious scams like these.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:52:24
I haven't.  I am mostly just wanting to get cash in to an exchange to buy btc.  I don't plan to cash out.  Seems like bitfloor is better than mtgox for this?  What are your thoughts.
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:54:05
Nice, I figure I'll do this for my next big hardware purchases as well.

More exchanges is definitely a good thing.

So by 2032: 20671875.00000000  = 99.21875011% of all btc will exist.
And by 2075 : 20999839.77420000
So basically every single one will be in existence by 2032.  19 more years of mining to go, in general. Then it will be all transaction processing.

I am sincerely asking. 
Your response 'hey go look up any x' isn't specific enough to support your initial argument.  
I am asking you to literally provide links/research to back up your claim, so that I can add that to my arsenal of knowledge on both sides of the Bitcoin argument!
Simply linking to a generic 'bubble phases' jpg isn't sufficient to back up your claims that "no market .. chart **we've ever seen** ..." is valid. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:29:46
Ok... there was another post in here saying not to use local till as well. I am very wary now : /  Wanted this to be painless.  Maybe I'll just do a local transaction.

Unless you pull your cash or btc out of mtgox, they have control over it, which is why their transactions aren't visible on the block chain. 
Anything done on mtgox stays there until you cash out to a private bank account or btc wallet.
