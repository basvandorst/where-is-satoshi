How soon they forget:
"...merchants made far more money than miners during the Gold Rush."
"On average, half the gold-seekers made a modest profit, after all expenses were taken into account. Most, however, especially those arriving later, made little or wound up losing money."
Six years in... "the economic climate had changed dramatically. Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to large groups of workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money."

In theory, if you had the computing power, you could rewrite the blockchain from the last checkpoint to make all the transactions favor you.  Then pretend your blockchain is the real blockchain.

Don't worry, mining is a very philanthropic pursuit, and there is absolutely no way a miner with more than 50% of the resources would dream of abusing his computing advantage for financial gain.

The supply of bitcoin-denominated services isn't large enough for the amount of money being pumped into the bitcoin market.  Nowhere near large enough.
The money being spent on bitcoins is speculative, it's not embracing the bitcoin marketplace.
BTC $30 or even BTC $15 is a speculative bubble.  Not that bubbles are necessarily bad, mind you, because they bring capital into a sector.  But it's never pleasant to live through a bubble deflating when it's your capital tied up in it...

You'd better tell the Bitcoin client development team that they are silly for hard-coding several block ID's into the client, to prevent the *entire* block chain from being overwritten.  The precise scenario I described is a real possibility.

Everybody needs to have their own crypto-currency.  You can have your own CitizenCoins, there can be I_RAPE_CATS promissory notes, and so on...
You are the brand, you are the currency.  May the best currency win!

So, all the resources should be allocated to the people who got into Bitcoin early?
There are alternatives to centrally-controlled inflation that don't involve giving away all the resources to a lucky few who jump on a bandwagon first.
Suppose Bitcoin mining yielded 50 BTC per block, forever?  Just as an example.

Whatever you do, don't put any information that could identify you or your company on the web site.  Accept payment ONLY in a non-refundable, easily laundered form like, say... Bitcoins.
These simple precautions will earn the trust of your target audience.

It's a function of the size of the marketplace.  The value of your money is what it can buy for you.
I wouldn't care to set a value, although I think in the short term, there's no support above $5.  If bitcoins end up replacing cash, the sky's the limit.  I have my own opinions on this subject, but you know what they say about opinions...

Your GPU mining rig only has, say, 1/20000th of the total network mining power so you might go weeks without generating any BTC at all - that's a big risk.  At this point (paralleling the "six years in" stage of the gold rush), the only sure way to get BTC is to join a pool.
It's hard to say how exactly it's going to turn out, because the barriers to entry for pools are still low.  We're seeing hints that barriers are emerging, e.g. the DDOS attacks on BTCguild et al right now.  If those barriers are enduring, eventually the owners of the dominant pools will have the power to demand much higher commissions, effectively turning the pool participants into their employees.  Nobody else will be able to lure participants away because new entrants will be wiped out with DDOS's or the like.
The amounts of money involved are much smaller than in the '49 gold rush, but it's fascinating to see how the dynamics are similar.

In principle, this shouldn't affect the Bitcoin network at all, even if the USPTO sides with the person who trademarked it.  In practice, any real world business who tries to accept "bitcoins" is going to be scared away by the trademark lawyers.  So you'll still have your bitcoins, but you won't be able to redeem them for anything valuable, including USD.  I assume the very first thing the lawyers would go after are the exchanges.
