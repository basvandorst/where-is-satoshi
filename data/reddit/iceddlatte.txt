Unless its got funds in it or you wanna keep it, delete it?

You can try and get your transaction accelerated, i did this the day before yesterday and it was confrimed within a couple hours. 
ViaBTC have a good accelerator..

Coinbase has a wallet option but it wouldnt be regarded as being totally safe as its first and foremost an exchange and tbh unless you have your private keys your btc is never completely safe. If your interested in cold storage look at something like a Ledger Nano S.

You could also try and get your transaction acelerated, just put in the transaction # and they should mine it in the next block. Try submitting it near or on the hour for higher chance of them accepting it.

Yeah, its probably in high demand. Ive got a couple of transactions accelerated though, so just keep trying on the hour.

Yeah like i get if you buy something like an S9, im talking more in terms of average person who builds their own with 3-4 GPU's etc. Would this still be relatively profitable over a period of time? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:47:57
Yeah i thought it may have something to do with the fee's. That was my bad, i didnt check before hitting the send button. 
So you think just wait it out and eventually it'll be confirmed, even with the low fees?

Been looking into mining alt coins and just using them to purchase btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:31:24
If youre still having problems you can use a transaction accelerator. Make sure you submit it around about on the hour eg. 14:00 etc for better chance of your transaction making into the block they'll mine.
