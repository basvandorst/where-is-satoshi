At first I thought this is awesome and wanted to share this with my Czech friends, but their facebook page makes it seem very strange.
This is not the message I would want to send when promoting Bitcoin:  ?
According to the facebook profile it seems like this is an art project. Is their goal to make people aware how easy it is to get bitcoin and buy illegal things/commit crime? Well done then.

.. It even seems like this was their main goal: Make an advert that only targets Bitcoin users. Judging by how horrible, bad and creepy that advert is. Only someone who is obsessed with bitcoin can like it. Everyone else will just turn it off. 
If the video would be really well done many more people would share it.

No, it is not one pizzeria. It's more like google for pizza. 
There are many different restaurants. This site just combines them all and let's people find a delivery service in their area.

I agree. It's very simple with PayPal. I love and use Bitcoin, but using Paypal also only takes a few seconds.

It seems like Charlie Shrem granted your wish.

I think that's great news. Porn is often leading the way:

I went there on a recent trip to Sarajevo because of this post/comment. It was so nice there that we came back the day after! Especially the bathroom. Thank you!
