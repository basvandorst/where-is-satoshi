Also, you don't necessarily have to open a channel to bitrefill. If your LN wallet has 3-4 channels with any random nodes, your tx likely will find a route to bitrefill within a few hops.

I am free to send money to anyone I want to. I pay miners a small fee to secure my transactions.

You can use coinhako in Malaysia and Singapore, and they're using Maybank. BitX was using CIMB.

Your expectation of being paid by the coin of your choice increases the value of that coin. Running a full node gives you control of that choice.

Yeah I suppose. Guess we have to wait for LN to enjoy instant tx. Anyways, if I have this plugged to a coffee maker at a digital currency event, I wouldn't care if someone tries to double spend for an automatically served cup.

It can't even do SSL, yet. It is better to use a Raspberry Pi with a SPV client, but that'll cost at least 10 times more and I can't afford that because I'm just a kid from a third world country.

Will need to swap ESP8266WiFi.h with Arduino equivalent. Or you can just get the Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 Breakout:

And for the merchant: no need to dispense change, no need to have someone empty the cash box/safe, automatically be alerted if stock is empty based on wallet balance.
Of course, the machine has to be connected to the internet. I think most vending machines in the world would be within wifi or cellular range.
