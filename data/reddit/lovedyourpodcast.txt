What does it matter if the salaries have increased ?

Look I agree with you and I like bitcoin. It's just that this new currency wasn't available before and I don't want to criticise the old way too much because there wasn't an alternative. 
But there are some key points of mine. The elite didint steal the money from the masses because the masses didn't have any wealth in the first place. You could say that they enslaved us or abused our time/energy, but the masses gained security, the masses gained ruling power over the planet, the masses gained technology, the masses gained delivery food. Yes. A select few gained a lot of wealth. But if we all agreed on that - that makes it ok. You know. 
We either accept that humans are to easily manipulated or that we all agreed on global injustice. Probably both. 
But now that we have tech to actually have a new type of currency, it's only reasonable to expect resistance. Like with any new kind of tech.

Maybe they made it up?

It makes it OK. Life is a brutal bitch and human 'intelligence' and their thought experiments are delusional imo. 
Don't you see any issues with cryptocurrency in the future?

1. don't insult people
2. we didint have tech to have non-fiat currency before. So we used it (or were forced into using it). It doesnt really matter. Point is - resistance is only natural, expected and welcomed in a strong economy. 
3. Your 1100 word post should have been 300 max.

Unsolvable and inescapable. The entire world, as we know it, must be destroyed and replaced with a new heavens and new earth.
Do we have any part in that or we just have to die off or smth? 
Can we transition life into life 2.0 (robots and AI's) and do something about it ?

Only if salaries do not increase.

It was nice talking :) I did not grow up in a religious background so 'faith' is hard to understand to me.

And we are all became way wealthier.
