As internet money I guess, maybe investing long-term.

Sorry I'm confused, what is bcash?
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:03:26
But it works just the same right?

Ok I guess I'll look into Litecoin, never heard of it before though... but buying temporarily means the price could drop at any moment right?

Yes because you'll get wiped out, doesn't matter someone else will put your money to work. You still have a chance to break away from your mental conditioning by floating around in this echo chamber too long, detach yourself from your emotions and look at the situation logically.
You have 1 coin which has extremely expensive transactions, is extremely slow and unreliable.
You have another coin which has extremely cheap transactions, is extremely fast and reliable.
Both are called Bitcoin - any sane/un-indoctrinated person would choose the latter.

You're deluded, I guess the world needs losers in life. 
$16B pump and dump is the most moronic thing I've ever heard.
The network effect is just as valid for BCH as BTC, BCH has 5 separate dev teams, much more decentralized and has a road map for the future. 
Futures market will migrate to BCH.

No it's not an a matter of opinion, a fork is not a copy, it is a divergence, champ.

1. ASIC boost? Compete.
2. Decentralized coins don't have owners
3. Good for Koreans
4. Markets are manipulated daily on every coin
5. See 4.
6,7,8. Not an argument.

Oh I'm the troll, I'm literally educating you but somehow I'm the troll. You don't like BCH and you can't explain why because you're indoctrinated by a private entity called Blockstream and they don't have your interests at heart.

Yes you're right.
the EDA for Bitcoin Cash will kick in at some point (IDK when), making blocks harder to find and may cause some miners to return to mine the Bitcoin Segwit blockchain for the next two days, at which point a hardfork upgrade is scheduled to occur which will stabilize and vastly improve the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. 
Great news, jump on.

Half the volume, which likely accounts for Chinese traders along with Koreans. You are quite deluded if you some how think oscillations in price equates to a multi-month "pump and dump".
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:00:07
Arguing with the indoctrinated... pointless.

As large as it needs to be, and not a megabyte larger.

A fork is not a copy, it is an upgrade, let's not get ahead of ourselves here champ.
