So it looks like they were right. You sent 16.9362 and recieved 16.936. The fee was .0002 btc

Would you say the same about owning stock? I don't think so. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:59:22
I mean 1500% since 1980 is a different than 1500% since last year

This is garbage logic. Market value decrease of an asset you own is a loss.

What's wrong with HFT?

The 2007 crisis was caused by a falling real estate market combined with poor risk evaluation on both pricing derivatives and giving out mortgages. HFT didn't do that people just say that because wall Street is a bogeyman people love to hate.

What if my lease includes utilities?

Because what they did does not fit the criminal definition of fraud. If you disagree please explain why with specific examples.
@_date: 2016-01-20 05:38:32
I thought so.
@_date: 2016-03-24 01:51:41
The biggest fault of the rating agencies was that they treated mortgages from different areas as uncorrelated when they actually weren't. This led to their calculations being bad and thus they gave out bad ratings. It wasn't fraud though because they didn't know their math was bad until it was too late. Fraud means intentional deception.

Mostly market making and simple arbitrages, not reading technicals

No I'm pretty sure the $10 bill is still worth $10. If you're going to inflation adjust that you have to adjust the value of the Bitcoin too

There's not really much more than that. There's nothing about pi that makes us more strongly believe that it is normal than say e or sqrt(2)
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:46:09
You're right there is a balance, and economists who have studied this far more than anyone in this thread have decided the best balancing point for economic growth and stability is at a small level of inflation, around 2% per year. That's why the Fed targets that rate.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:55:55


That's not how markets work, you don't expect the value to keep going up  just because it went up previously. If that's how markets worked you could make a fortune by buying all the stocks that did really well last year but there's a reason hedge funds don't use this strategy, it doesn't work.

This is what I hate about Reddit comment structure. When you reply to a reply you get lumped in with original comment even if you were going off on a tangent. All I was saying was that our reasons for thinking pi is normal are not anything special, which is a somewhat subjective point
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:26:29
I know but everything that tells us pi is probably normal applies to pretty much every irrational number that isn't explicitly created to not be normal. It probably is but acting like this is some interesting property of pi is dumb
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:22:11


Key word "believed" the other poster is correct. Whether or not pi is normal is an open question.

It doesn't work at all, it's a joke, it has no use as a compression algorithm
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:42:21
I never said every irrational is normal. I just said the reasons we have for thinking pi is normal aren't that special and apply to sqrt(2) and e and basically any other irrational you could come up with that isn't explicitly constructed to not be normal

If land is taxed at its full rental value its sale value should go to 0. No one would ever have an incentive to pay up front to own land and then pay the full rental value each year when they could just rent it for eternity and have the same usage and the same payments just without the up front payment.

So with the discount can I buy for 3.1% under spot? That seems too good to be true
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:58:27
10% discount on the fee or 10% on the price? because if its on price you're either giving away a bunch of money or charging a ridiculous markup in the first place
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:11:57
The market grows exponentially but when a specific asset beats the market significantly over a certain time frame (like bitcoin) that doesn't mean we expect it to continue to beat the market in the future. The same logic you're using on bitcoin would predict amazon will have a 1 quadrillion dollar market cap by 2040 do you believe that or do you think that maybe there's a flaw in your reasoning?
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:17:59
This has obvious practical issue that others have pointed out but a bigger problem is that pi hasn't actually ever been proven to contain every digit string so it is an open question whether this works. We suspect that pi does because the set of reals that don't has measure 0 and there is no reason to think that pi is among them since it is irrational and has no obvious connection to decimal or any other base representation but this is still an open question.

Real estate is a whole separate issue. As a geolibertarian I support land value taxes to fix that clusterfuck.
People parking their value in gold is also unproductive compared to investing in the economy through stocks or loans but I'm not convinced that gold investing is as prevalent as hoarding cash would be in a deflationary environment

No holding is what investments are for, exchange is what currency is for.

Why would you expect the fee measured in bitcoins to stay constant when the price of bitcoin increases
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:00:29
There's a difference between saying "the only reason people suspect pi is normal is that it is irrational" and "all irrational numbers are normal" the first is mostly true (you could add 'and also we have no reason to suspect it's not' but that's just a technicality) the second is false

The kind of people willing to pay a premium to trade bitcoin locally do not want to go anywhere near a police station.

But a structure wouldn't be a good investment the way a plot of land is. It would be like any other property. Land is special because you can't make more of it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:22:01
If you don't necessarily oike thinking of it this try the fact bit coin is deflationary so we expect things measured in btc to go down over time
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:40:14
Its measured in bitcoins but the actual amount you need is determined by what the nodes will accept. If bitcoins skyrockets then more people will accept less bitcoins because its still more money

In finance terms we would say that altcoins have a higher beta. When the market as a whole goes up they gain more but when the market crashes they tend to lose more.

The current fees are way too high for this to be reasonable. No one wants to pay $3 in fees to send $10 to their Uber driver. And no one wants to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed either. This is not a good use case for Bitcoin
