I’ve invested to understand it not to change things bro. You have to follow the money to understand where we’re going and why. Your a very small minded person if you think people are stupid for ignoring or joining at a later stage. Not everyone has the luxury of new technologies like this ukno.

I’m just saying we don’t fully understand What’s going to happen in 10..15.. or even 20 years time.  We all thought fiat currencies were the future and now cash is becoming eradicated, digital money is taking over. Look at Sweden for example...less than 5% use or are allowed to use cash. Even the homeless have card readers!! Anything digital can be traced,used and manipulated by people of True power for their own gains.

Did you not trust the banks at one point bro?  you didn’t truly understand then so what makes you think you understand now? you’ve realised how corrupt they really are only through time so all I’m saying is only time will tell.
