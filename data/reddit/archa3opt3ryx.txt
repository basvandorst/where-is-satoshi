~~So I have Apache\maven\bin added to my PATH user variable, and M2=%M2_HOME%\bin and M2_HOME=C:\Program Files\Apache\maven added to my system variables, but I still can't run mvn from the command line. I just get "'mvn' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."!~~
nm, worked after a reboot. No luck though, reports zero keys found. :(

I’ll try that tomorrow, thanks!

I know, I’m not sending the files anywhere. I’m sure most people are trustworthy, but it’s impossible to be sure. Also, there’s almost certainly less than 1 BTC in this wallet, if anything...all the BTC I had was from mining on a single GTX 680 over &lt; 1 year, so it won’t be a lot. I think I lost most of it in the Mt Gox debacle anyway.

If there was a 51% attack, Bitcoin's value would plummet. (Part of) its value lies in its security.

I submitted my verification on Wednesday and just got approved today. Might want to contact customer service...if such a thing exists at Gemini...

Would you mind just posting a real quick walkthrough of how you can run it? I don't have much Java experience, mostly Python.

You trust your mobile device, which can be easily lost and connects to many different networks every day which could have any number of nefarious users on them, over a stationary desktop computer that's in your locked apartment and behind your firewall?

I sort of understand this...I definitely understand the first diagram in Satoshi's original Bitcoin paper, where every transaction is simply a digitally signed hash (with the previous owner's private key) of all the previous transactions of that coin, plus the new owner's public key appended to the end. 
I don't understand how that relates to a wallet in cold storage vs an exchange. When your bitcoins are being held by an exchange, really what's happening is that the exchange has the private key (which, for the purposes of bitcoin, really means that they own the coin), but they provide you with a login to allow you to trade that coin for USD/ETH/LTC etc? Doesn't that mean that they become a "trusted third party", since they could spend your coins without your permission? Isn't that what the original bitcoin concept was trying to avoid?
