Mate... As a dev.... You're a jewel. People are lucky when they get someone like you amongst their users.

Is QA work really something you're interested in? I could hook you up, but, as someone who did it (and quite well, btw) for many years, it is not a rewarding job, neither in pride nor salary. It opens doors, but that's about it...

Heh, just the concept of a Muslim Cleric... There is supposed to be no one between a faithful and Allah. Then came the teachers, then the advisers, then the judges...

Saying it *should* resist it doesn't mean *do nothing*. We can actively plan for it, vote with our nodes, wallet, activate or re-activate miners, communicate with core (or whichever side you believe to be the true branch) and so on. Bitcoin is only as resilient as its actors.

In this case, I could see the password being divided in, say, 5 fragments, and then each having 3-5 redundancy in a group of 10-20 people...

Wasn't that one of the reason for the fork in the first place, btw?

Whether it should be applied or not, it is wonderful as far as implications go.

You need a "do something" for when it goes flat ;P

But is it over 8000?

I sold 47 BTC back in the day at around 70$ each! AH!

I think as a community we should just "freeze" those coins (refuse them in any transactions). Have exchanges, shops, etc. watch those addresses and any using those coins and mark them as terrorist accounts.
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:10:16
How so? Our money can be subdivided as much as is needed. We ALSO have the benefit of a money than can be tracked. We CAN, if we choose to, say &lt;this subsection of a coin&gt; shouldn't be traded. We can choose to have a cut-time, to avoid having innocent caught in the cross-fire (any money sent to x address should not be received from y time. After that, any transactions are suspected of being the same person hiding the trail. If the coin moved out of that address before y, well, alright, it's fungible and thus we can't assume it was made in bad faith.) We LITERALLY have one more advantage over normal currency, something with which we can resist blackmail and terrorism better than any other currency, something that can be chosen to be obeyed or not per exchange and market (Country 1 think it's terrorism? They refuse it. Country 2 think it's defence? They can accept it). HOW are we not looking at this and saying to users that get blackmailware "It's ok, we have your back, look how much better Bitcoin is to normal currency"?

Found the asshole that insults rather than argue.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:05:16
If you read, I *clearly* mention this would be independent lists. I have no authority on this other than suggesting a behaviour. But it's scary that people like you think that easily traceable ransoms SHOULD be allowed to re-circulate. This goes contrary to never negotiate with terrorists.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:36:37
Oh, am I? I do not endorse any amount of spying, but I do endorse social order. Want to log communications from someone? I'm against it. Want to send someone caught in the act of killing 10 people in prisons? I agree (or mental hospital, if that is the best course). What you seem to willingly ignore is the unique nature of the block chain. It WILL be well used and it WILL be misused. The best we can do is attempt our best to strengthen it against misuse but that does NOT mean not using the technology for helping people. Unless you can actually justify ransomware. I do not believe in slippery-slope arguments (that's the one that *authorities* usually use to curtail liberties), so, again, defend ransomwares or tell me WHY we should accept those coins if we can block them in time at the source.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:25:20
You do realize the different of scope effort between the two, right? We are already assuming Satoshi's coins are as good as lost, burning obvious terrorist coins (and that's what they are, I'd like someone to justify otherwise) is not an argument FOR bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:53:06
That... Was a much better counter-argument than I was expecting. With documentation to back you and politeness. I'm still not at ease with *how* you wrote it, but I definitively see your point now. Thank you for your time!

Let's play card on table. I've been with Bitcoin since very early on. Did mining on cpu. Bought a computer with inheritance money to mine on gpu (the right one at the time!). Mine with multiple ASIC. Micro-invested and had returns. Now I'm waiting around for the next BTC thing. I'm pro-Segwit, not certain about the 2mb. My reddit account is somewhat old, but I did create it to replace an older one that had once caused me trouble in another circle.
I say all of this just to add weight to what follow, not to give me some sort of authority:
"I am constantly rebutted by these individuals and others here that account age does not matter, that we should judge the words for their merit.
They are correct of course. We absolutely should judge the content of the post based on merit and not on account age."
Meritocracy? GREAT! You speak my language. Things should definitively be evaluated as they are, else we open the door to feel over real, thought crimes, rejecting improvements based on their origin and so on.
"But theres this other side thats missing."
Oh no... (Btw, I read the &lt;but&gt; segment. But what do YOU care about THEIR self-improvement? How are YOU the police of that? Why is it anyone's duty? I found r/btc before r/bitcoin and I could make my way here based on the arguments. Why do you not afford others the ability to think for themselves? To see through fakery, grand-standing and lies? Just put your arguments out there and they'll win if they're better, nobody cares about the messenger!)

They and Core share that philosophy and I have faith that as long as the main devs of the clients out there think like that (not imposing personal philosophy), Bitcoin will survive anything thrown at it and keep on growing!

Well, reminder that a near complete proof was found later and took a long while to be discredited. Aka, he might have thought he had one...
